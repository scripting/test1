    "text": "On Sunday I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1031889058451128325\">tweeted</a> that librarians should run the web. I got a fair amount of snarky pushback on this. I didn't mean that <i>you</i> should run the web. I meant that the web should be run by people who are librarians. That the first questions they would ask would be questions librarians would ask. I've seen decisions made <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/08/10.html#a123459\">lately</a> that took no account of the web as an archival medium. As a result, links to unknown amounts of the web broke that wouldn't have, if librarians ran the web. That's the thought behind that idea. The <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+librarian&t=hj&ia=web\">librarians</a> I've known have been considerate, even loving people. I've <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/07/23/125635.html\">written</a> about that. Now I get that (of course) some are jerks. How could it be otherwise? Living is a process of having your ideals chipped away at. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",
