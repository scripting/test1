            "text": "I was talking with <a href=\"http://wmf.editthispage.com/\">Wes Felter</a> last night about a project I want to do. I want to get Frontier running more or less as-is on Linux. <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22wes+felter%22&t=hi&ia=twitter\">Wes</a> was an early <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+wes+felter&t=hj&ia=web\">UserLander</a>, he got us started with Frontier as an HTTP server. He understood the product at the time in ways I didn't. What came from that? \"XML-RPC\", the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/web.html\">website framework</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software#Manila\">Manila</a>, \"Radio UserLand\" and lots of other stuff. We talked about how to get the project done, and he suggested doing video demos of the things that make Frontier unique. It's a really good idea. And kind of daunting. I'm thinking about how to get started. I think the first step is to think of a project I can do in steps, that touches on most aspects of the environment. Maybe a web site for <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22bull+mancuso%22&t=hi&ia=web\">Bull Mancuso</a> or <a href=\"http://kim.smallpict.com/\">Kim Parker</a> of <a href=\"http://bloatware.org/\">Bloatware</a> (two not-so-famous fake people I use for demos and docs). It would be more interesting if it turned out to be something useful that made sense to deploy in Frontier. I wouldn't mind setting up a server on Amazon running Windows just to get the app up and running. And then getting that app running in Frontier on Linux would be the home run. ",

I didn't mean that <i>you</i> should run the web. I meant that the web should be run by people who are librarians. That the first questions they would ask would be questions librarians would ask. I've seen decisions made <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/08/10.html#a123459\">lately</a> that took no account of the web as an archival medium. As a result, links to unknown amounts of the web broke that wouldn't have, if librarians ran the web. That's the thought behind that idea. The <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+librarian&t=hj&ia=web\">librarians</a> I've known have been considerate, even loving people. I've <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/07/23/125635.html\">written</a> about that. Now I get that (of course) some are jerks. How could it be otherwise?
