<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/21/bloatwareBoss.png"><a name="a144138"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/21/bloatwareBoss.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I was talking with <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/">Wes Felter</a> last night about a project I want to do. I want to get Frontier running more or less as-is on Linux. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22wes+felter%22&t=hi&ia=twitter">Wes</a> was an early <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+wes+felter&t=hj&ia=web">UserLander</a>, he got us started with Frontier as an HTTP server. He understood the product at the time in ways I didn't. What came from that? <a href="http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/">XML-RPC</a>, the <a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/web.html">website framework</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software#Manila">Manila</a>, <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio UserLand</a> and lots of other stuff. We talked about how to get the project done, and he suggested doing video demos of the things that make Frontier unique. It's a really good idea. And kind of daunting. I'm thinking about how to get started. I think the first step is to think of a project I can do in steps, that touches on most aspects of the environment. Maybe a web site for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22bull+mancuso%22&t=hi&ia=web">Bull Mancuso</a> or <a href="http://kim.smallpict.com/">Kim Parker</a> of <a href="http://bloatware.org/">Bloatware</a> (two not-so-famous fake people I use for demos and docs). It would be more interesting if it turned out to be something useful that made sense to deploy in Frontier. I wouldn't mind setting up a server on Amazon running Windows just to get the app up and running. And then getting that app running in Frontier on Linux would be the home run. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/21.html#a144138" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a134056"></a>Comedians should do the news. Proof is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzv6EhE7Cbo">Robin Williams</a> on The Tonight Show in 1991. He covers Supreme Court hearing for Clarence Thomas, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and everything else. (PS: Trump is a comedian. That's his (open) secret. He entertains his base.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/21.html#a134056" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/01/16/librarianActionFigure.png"><a name="a131335"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2018/01/16/librarianActionFigure.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">On Sunday I <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1031889058451128325">tweeted</a> that librarians should run the web. I got a fair amount of snarky pushback on this. I didn't mean that <i>you</i> should run the web. I meant that the web should be run by people who are librarians. That the first questions they would ask would be questions librarians would ask. I've seen decisions made <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/10.html#a123459">lately</a> that took no account of the web as an archival medium. As a result, links to unknown amounts of the web broke that wouldn't have, if librarians ran the web. That's the thought behind that idea. The <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+librarian&t=hj&ia=web">librarians</a> I've known have been considerate, even loving people. I've <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/23/125635.html">written</a> about that. Now I get that (of course) some are jerks. How could it be otherwise? Living is a process of having your ideals chipped away at. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/21.html#a131335" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
