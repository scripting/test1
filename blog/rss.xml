			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/08/20/end-era-old-harvard-blogging-site&quot;&gt;Inside Higher Ed&lt;/a&gt; has a story about the Berkman blogs. They raise the right issues. Can't we do better than just throwing away archives, esp from a project that yielded such good results. I'm also not sure what Berkman meant about the blogs being antiquated. They seem to be saying people would be better off writing on Facebook or Twitter. Blogs have significant advantages over writing for social networks. There are tradeoffs. Perhaps the server software hasn't been updated. That could be a problem. We can help with the decisions Harvard is making. But there has to be communication first. I've gone first.</description>

			<description>Today I learned that calls to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/davegithub&quot;&gt;davegithub&lt;/a&gt; are not re-entrant, meaning you have to wait till call N completes before starting call N+1.</description>

			<description>Just got &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/22/anotherGoogleEmailWarning.png&quot;&gt;this email&lt;/a&gt; from Google saying that some pages of mine are violating their Adsense policy. As far as I can recall, I don't have Google ads on any of my pages. Maybe at one time I tried it out on the XML-RPC site, but I don't think they're there anymore. Whatever. I tried to find a listing somewhere of the errors, and their site doesn't make it easy to find, if it's there at all.</description>

			<description>Emptying a folder with over 5 million items, it's already taken an hour, I get &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/22/dialog.png&quot;&gt;dialogs&lt;/a&gt; like this at random times. The current Mac OS is 25-plus years old. It took 10 minutes to preflight the deletion, couldn't all the confirmations be up front, so it can do this operation unattended?</description>

			<description>On the Mac we had a phonebook size doc called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Macintosh&quot;&gt;Inside Macintosh&lt;/a&gt;. It was divided into toolkits, which were analogous to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/packages&quot;&gt;packages&lt;/a&gt;. At the beginning of each chapter was the theory, tightly written and edited. You might have to read a couple of times before grokking. Then all the calls you could make against the objects. As a result devs not only understood how to program the platform, but also understood the theory. I realize now that we are missing the equivalent doc for the web. Of course it wouldn't be printed. As a result you fumble around in the dark on a lot of stuff, not really understanding why things are the way they are, what the designers were thinking, and then years later it dawns on you. It's not too late imho to fill in this missing piece.</description>

			<description>We, who accuse the Repubs of cowardice, are just as scared as they are. Or we'd start striking, with picket lines. Shut the economy down until Trump leaves. It may ultimately come to that, but who knows, by then it might be too late. It's not too late now.</description>

			<description>Thinking about where I am in re a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/21.html#a144138&quot;&gt;Linux version&lt;/a&gt; of Frontier. I just realized that my collection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;GitHub projects&lt;/a&gt; amount to the built-in verb set of Frontier. There are big missing pieces, and they aren't tied together in an object database, but the functionality is there. I am often reminded of this, when writing a utility script that would take minutes in Frontier, and I'm already on Day Two in JavaScript.  For example, here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/utils/blob/master/daveutils.js&quot;&gt;JS code&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveutils&quot;&gt;daveutils&lt;/a&gt; package. I even use the same names as in Frontier, but without the Frontier syntax.</description>

			<title>Trolls die in darkness</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've completely had it with people who RT the troller-in-chief.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have zero tolerance for Trump RTers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you RT him you shine the light on him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It makes no difference to the troll whether you like or dislike.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You're feeding the troll either way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am fed up with supposed members of The Resistance who RT the troll. You are every bit as bad as Fox News. If people stopped RTing him now, he'd lose his power. You can help by shaming people who RT him, no matter what their stated intention. I'm going a step further and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1032293670161211393&quot;&gt;namechecking&lt;/a&gt; them as I unfollow. Help bring notoriety to the troll-feeders. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For more info see my &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;FAQ on trolling&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trolls are light-powered. Trolls die in darkness. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trolls die in darkness. And that's a good thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: With apologies to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-washington-posts-new-slogan-turns-out-to-be-an-old-saying/2017/02/23/cb199cda-fa02-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was talking with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wmf.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;Wes Felter&lt;/a&gt; last night about a project I want to do. I want to get Frontier running more or less as-is on Linux. &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22wes+felter%22&amp;t=hi&amp;ia=twitter&quot;&gt;Wes&lt;/a&gt; was an early &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+wes+felter&amp;t=hj&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;UserLander&lt;/a&gt;, he got us started with Frontier as an HTTP server. He understood the product at the time in ways I didn't. What came from that? &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/web.html&quot;&gt;website framework&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software#Manila&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; and lots of other stuff. We talked about how to get the project done, and he suggested doing video demos of the things that make Frontier unique. It's a really good idea. And kind of daunting. I'm thinking about how to get started. I think the first step is to think of a project I can do in steps, that touches on most aspects of the environment. Maybe a web site for &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22bull+mancuso%22&amp;t=hi&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Bull Mancuso&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://kim.smallpict.com/&quot;&gt;Kim Parker&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloatware.org/&quot;&gt;Bloatware&lt;/a&gt; (two not-so-famous fake people I use for demos and docs). It would be more interesting if it turned out to be something useful that made sense to deploy in Frontier. I wouldn't mind setting up a server on Amazon running Windows just to get the app up and running. And then getting that app running in Frontier on Linux would be the home run.</description>

			<description>Comedians should do the news. Proof is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzv6EhE7Cbo&quot;&gt;Robin Williams&lt;/a&gt; on The Tonight Show in 1991. He covers Supreme Court hearing for Clarence Thomas, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and everything else. (PS: Trump is a comedian. That's his (open) secret. He entertains his base.)</description>

			<description>On Sunday I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1031889058451128325&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that librarians should run the web. I got a fair amount of snarky pushback on this. I didn't mean that &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; should run the web. I meant that the web should be run by people who are librarians. That the first questions they would ask would be questions librarians would ask. I've seen decisions made &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/10.html#a123459&quot;&gt;lately&lt;/a&gt; that took no account of the web as an archival medium. As a result, links to unknown amounts of the web broke that wouldn't have, if librarians ran the web. That's the thought behind that idea. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+librarian&amp;t=hj&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;librarians&lt;/a&gt; I've known have been considerate, even loving people. I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/23/125635.html&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about that. Now I get that (of course) some are jerks. How could it be otherwise? Living is a process of having your ideals chipped away at. 🤷‍♂️</description>

			<description>Brent Simmons has been working on a Frontier port, for the modern Mac OS. He's naming the project &lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/2018/08/20/rainier_diary_9_the_renaming&quot;&gt;Ranier&lt;/a&gt;. I like it, esp because the last three letters are ier, which says the foundation originated in Frontier, but it also frees up Brent to follow the product where it wants to go. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Journalism has lots of problems, but the really big one is that distribution is a mess.

			<title>It's time to rebel</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If the news wants to be effective it should spend some amount of time not just describing our quagmire, but having realistic discussions for what we can do to dig out of it. There's no discussion of this on MSNBC as far as I know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When Jonathan Chait &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/08/media-trump-russia-collusion-benefit-of-the-doubt.html&quot;&gt;asks&lt;/a&gt; why news won't factor in the corruption of the Trump govt, I think it's because if they did, they'd have to start leading the rebellion, or at least looking for people to interview who are ready to lead.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience&quot;&gt;Civil disobedience&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_strike&quot;&gt;general strike&lt;/a&gt;. Boycotts and picket lines. Those are proper citizen responses to treason on the part of the president. These ideas should be present in the press coverage. But if you put off accepting as fact the corruption of the government, you don't have to cross that bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>It would be great to have a daily website that summarizes what's on each of the MSNBC shows, so I don't have to watch them. Each segment on each show. Any new information or ideas makes it in. Omit recitals of previous optics. I don't care what pundits think. Same for each of the Sunday morning shows. I just don't have the patience. If I had to list something I learned from any stretch of MSNBC-watching, I might learn one thing every week and that's it. Most of the stuff they report as news is what has appeared in my RSS river during the day. Please go ahead and put ads on the site. Or ask for donations via Patreon. It's worth a few bucks a month, also because it will force MSNBC to change, to stop being so repetitive, and to start taking a look at news more broadly than just how the legal case against Trump is proceeding or not. There is other stuff going on, and there are other ideas that need exploring. They are deep in a pointless rut.</description>

			<description>I finished &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Deadwood&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth a rewatch, to see how a person with huge money and a toxic character can destroy a community. In the end it is anything but a comedy. The last couple of episodes, when they wrap everything up, are really low quality. You see this happen sometimes in a great series. Everything but the writing is still great. They make up for the lack of coherence with music, to try to make the stupid shit they're doing seem dramatic, which just makes me turn away. I remember being angry that they didn't do a fourth season when the show was running. I have no such feeling now. I think they could have ended it without the last couple of episodes. Even so, it's a story for our times, in tech and politics, now one very rich and toxic person can spoil a flawed but vibrant community. Some rich people got rich by stinking up the room so thoroughly that people of integrity say &lt;i&gt;Go ahead you can have it. &lt;/i&gt;That's their business model. Look at the top names in tech history. At least 1 in 4 are like that, in my experience. And there are a few second-tier characters like that as well.</description>

The last couple of episodes, when they wrap everything up, are really low quality. You see this happen sometimes in a great series. Everything but the writing is still great. They make up for the lack of coherence with music, to try to make the stupid shit they're doing seem dramatic, which just makes me turn away. I remember being angry that they didn't do a fourth season when the show was running. I have no such feeling now. I think they could have ended it without the last couple of episodes. Even so, it's a story for our times, in tech and politics, now one very rich and toxic person can spoil a flawed but vibrant community. Some rich people got rich by stinking up the room so thoroughly that people of integrity say &lt;i&gt;Go ahead you can have it. &lt;/i&gt;That's their business model. Look at the top names in tech history. At least 1 in 4 are like that, in my experience. And there are a few second-tier characters like that as well." created="Sun, 19 Aug 2018 15:39:28 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/19/racehorse.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/08/19.html#a153928"/>

			<description>Everyone's experience with Twitter is different. As is every person's experience with podcasting; and everything else in life. To say Twitter is boring or abusive or whatever is like making an equivalent statement about movies or the telephone or travel.</description>

			<description>I'm in season 3 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Deadwood&lt;/a&gt; now. Very different experience from the first time through when I watched the episodes as they came out. One thing that's clear is that it's a comedy. And they sometimes had a blast in the writer's room, with puns and characters finishing each others' speeches. I know in advance some characters are doomed, which is disturbing. And I had forgotten how evil some characters are. Not Swearengen though. He's a poet and hippie. Has limited ambition. That isn't clear in the first season, but by the third he's matured, as has Bullock, to become peacemakers even civil rights advocates.</description>

			<title>Automattic and speech</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Update: After writing this piece, I got a correction via Twitter DM from Automattic founder and CEO Matt Mullenweg: &quot;Automattic doesn't host Alex Jones and I don't think ever has.&quot; I probably didn't read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/business/media/sandy-hook-conspiracies-leonard-pozner.html&quot;&gt;NYT piece&lt;/a&gt; carefully enough, and came to the incorrect conclusion about the sites in question. However the gist of this piece remains valid. There is a higher level question to answer, where if anywhere is there a line that protects speech on the net, or does every service vendor have a say in what their platform is used for, or are some required to be neutral?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're having an ill-defined debate over when silos have to yield to public pressure and deny access to members who are deemed undesirable by a vocal group of objectors. There's no process. People have pointed out that as private companies they are free to do as they please. I'm not entirely sure that's true, especially when combined they control virtually all the speech on the net. While that might not be a violation of the First Amendment, it could easily be a violation of antitrust laws. Having run a couple of companies I know how often companies come up against those laws, even small companies, far from having a controlling stake in a large market.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Alex Jones is the first major test of this new system of speech governance. He has been banned by Facebook, YouTube, and put on a timeout by Twitter. Now the question has been raised whether Automattic, the operators of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt; should be pressured to force the Jones site off their platform. A major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/business/media/sandy-hook-conspiracies-leonard-pozner.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in Monday's NY Times raises that question, and my friend Davis Shaver &lt;a href=&quot;https://davisshaver.com/2018/08/16/automattic-needs-to-rebalance-its-hate-speech-free-speech-protections-as-soon-as-possible/&quot;&gt;opines&lt;/a&gt;. But there's a problem in this analysis because Wordpress.com isn't like the others, it isn't a silo, so banning him from that service will not necessarily have any affect on the presence of his site. He will be able to export his site, set up his own server, point the DNS entry at that server, and proceed on the open web and it will appear to outside viewers as if nothing happened. This will be the end of the discussion, unless the anti-speech advocates try to exert pressure on the open web. There they will find there is no CEO, no corporate headquarters, no shareholders afraid of losing value, none of the usual pressure points. If the web maintains its integrity, Alex Jones will be able to spread his vile &lt;a href=&quot;https://sandyhookstalkers.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;hateful&lt;/a&gt; and possibly libelous &lt;a href=&quot;https://sandyhooked.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;ideas&lt;/a&gt; without further accosting. I for one am rooting for the open web, and in this way rooting for Mr. Jones. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People should take two steps back from this debate and think. Where exactly is the line? What if a vocal minority of Internet users decided the ACLU shouldn't have a place to opine its hateful and disloyal fake news? What if it was decided that any site that didn't show proper reverence for Dear Leader Chairman Trump should be denied access to the public square? There must be a line in here somewhere. I ask the thinkers to consider, where exactly is that line? Alex Jones is on the wrong side, but who is on the right side, whose speech do we want to protect? Or is there a line at all? Perhaps dissent a quaint old idea of the past?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

For some reason a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=bike+speaker&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon yielded nothing but crap, but if you know what you're looking for you get some pretty nice stuff.

The bungee that's built in works fine on a bike, and I took it for a spin just now and it's perfect. Great sound. Totally loud enough to be heard over NYC street noise, with great frequency range and thumpin base to keep the wheels turning. A really great answer. Davey's a happy cyclist. Thanks everyone for the great advice. I want to try all of these speakers.</description>

			<title>100 pointless editorials</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't see what good &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gctelegram.com/opinion/20180814/some-newspapers-are-buying-into-ill-conceived-protest&quot;&gt;100 editorials&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow will do. The problem journalism has is that it is at war with a formidable adversary, the head of the US government. It's time to consult with people who have studied war. I suspect they will say that 100 editorials wouldn't have had much impact on Japan or Germany at the beginning of World War II. We never would have thought to respond to the 9/11 attacks with 100 stinging editorials. When attacked in an outright and clear act of war, aim at the power of the enemy, analyze and develop our own power, and fight back, to win.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the enemy is very powerful. His greatest power is that he didn't demobilize his supporters when he took office as every other presidential incumbent has. It's smart. I pleaded with Obama to do exactly that when he took office in 2009. The web was ready to take Obama's message of intellectual and just government all around the world. Instead he stuck to norms. And ran head-on into a Republican blockade. Nothing could get him out of the Rose Garden and back on the campaign trail. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let this be a lesson from now on: Presidents must stay on the campaign trail at all times. The power of the presidency is to rally the people, and when done best it's a unifying campaign, not a divisive one, like the one Trump persists.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And that, imho is exactly what journalism must do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Journalism has to break the biggest norm it has. Break the wall that separates it from their supposed audience, which is &lt;i&gt;rapidly&lt;/i&gt; dissipating. They've lost the ones that follow Trump. The rest of us are losing patience. Hopefully on Friday morning, in the non-existent afterglow of the pointless editorial demonstration, they will start looking outside their cocoon for answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The problem journalism has is that it is at war with a formidable adversary, the head of the US government. It's time to consult with people who have studied war. I suspect they will say that 100 editorials wouldn't have had much impact on Japan or Germany at the beginning of World War II. We never would have thought to respond to the 9/11 attacks with 100 stinging editorials. When attacked in an outright and clear act of war, aim at the power of the enemy, analyze and develop our own power, and fight back, to win." created="Wed, 15 Aug 2018 15:13:06 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/15/paratrooper.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/08/15/150902.html#a151306"/>

			<title>Berkman weblogs, followup</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A followup to my post &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/10.html#a121444&quot;&gt;last Friday&lt;/a&gt;. I had just heard about something happening with the blogs we hosted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+berkman+weblogs&amp;t=hi&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; and beyond at &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;blogs.harvard.edu&lt;/a&gt;. I'm still not clear on what happened. I would like to know, and to see if there's anything we can do to keep the archived content available at the same address it has been at all along. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zittrain/status/1027936755796860928&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; to one of my tweets from Jonathan Zittrain, a former colleague at &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;Berkman&lt;/a&gt;, who is still there. He pointed me to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.harvard.edu/blog/2018/07/13/upcoming-changes/&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; they posted. Not much information there about what was about to happen, or has happened since. At the very least we should know what remains, what is gone, and what is the plan for the future. And perhaps we, outside of Harvard, can help in some way. We have some experience with these issues. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think a great university like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University&quot;&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; that places a high value on learning, history, tradition, and played a big role in fostering the development of social media, both as the home of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg#College_years&quot;&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt; in the early Facebook days, and &lt;i&gt;at the very same time&lt;/i&gt; to the nascent blogging and podcasting community, should take an active interest not only in preserving the record, but in helping to set standards for how the web can continue long-term, even in the age of silos and corporate ownership. We, collectively, have a responsibility imho to do this well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Imho this is a project that should interest &lt;a href=&quot;https://library.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;librarians&lt;/a&gt; at Harvard and elsewhere. There are a lot of great libraries there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/14/toMathewIngram.m4a&quot;&gt;20-minute podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I got involved in a discussion with Mathew Ingram, Om Malik and others on Twitter on what is going on with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.joincivil.com/introducing-the-first-civil-council-members-and-looking-ahead-to-the-next-year-def988ae25a1&quot;&gt;Civil&lt;/a&gt; and what's needed to get journalism the support of the people that it so totally needs. I want to tell the story of the W3C and the IETF and how the tech industry made it look like the tech was open without it being open. We need journalism, and we can't afford to wait for the experiments to prove not to be the answer. I outline emphatically what needs to happen now. Journalism needs to grow, without the limits that journalism has placed on itself. This is addressed to Mathew but it's really meant for everyone. I apologize in advance for using him as a foil. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I bought a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_Pill&quot;&gt;Beats Pill&lt;/a&gt; a number of years ago, but the battery is shot. Not finding many choices, certainly no brands I've heard of and there don't seem to be any reviews. Has to mount on handlebar.</description>

			<description>We're a few weeks into the new Chrome way of labeling sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;NOT SECURE&lt;/font&gt;. I haven't seen any notable changes among readers. The only people questioning the security of the site, that I know of, are the same ones who followed Google's lead without considering the negative consequences on the web as an archival medium. I took a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1027582827381096448&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; of my followers on Twitter and found that 68% of the Chrome users are seeing the &lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;NOT SECURE&lt;/font&gt; message. Here was a chance for some to express concerns, and there were none. My Chrome hasn't updated yet, apparently, so I don't see it here. I'm sure there are less draconian solutions for sites that are basically archives to Google's stated goal of assuring the content hasn't been meddled with in a MITM way while in transport. I have ideas, but so far I haven't seen much evidence of Google's interest. A bad sign for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; manager, btw. But it's par for the course for Silicon Valley tech companies. I've had this experience with all of them, Sun, Apple, Microsoft, even the company I founded, after I left. We're the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Znh0OM9jiA&quot;&gt;power&lt;/a&gt;, you're nobody, why should we listen. It's a terrible way to govern an even worse way to manage a platform.</description>

			<title>Silos vs decentralized networks</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1028630757856751616&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Johannes Ernst is smart and brave. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://upon2020.com/blog/2018/08/why-decentralized-social-networking-never-makes-it-ever-heard-of-crossing-the-chasm/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; decentralized networks never make it, and there are reasons for this. I agree, in a way, but ultimately think his theory is wrong. Because &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+decentralized&amp;t=hi&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;decentralized&lt;/a&gt; networks have blossomed and survived, and imho will still be operating when the silos are gone.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Consider the case of RSS vs Twitter. When Twitter came along it grew fast, it overtook RSS. It didn't do away with RSS, because it's still here co-existing with Twitter. It still has advantages over Twitter. Richer data. Extensibility. Podcasting. Titles. Styling. Multiple links per item. No character limit. If RSS has so much going for it, why did Twitter surpass it? Not for any of the reasons Johannes cites. Imho it was because subscribing was done with a single click. That could have been done with RSS too, in fact we had it working in our own RSS network at UserLand, we called it the &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/userGuide/reference/macros/xmlCoffeeMug&quot;&gt;coffee mug&lt;/a&gt;. One click to subscribe. it could have become a universal one-click subscribe, if our competitors were willing to go along with UserLand's leadership, but they weren't. One  click to subscribe was an important survival trait in the Darwinian ecosystem of online social nets. Twitter had it, RSS didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Johannes mentions two other features: trending topics and search. I guess he's right about trending topics, but the feature has no value for me, it's there on the Twitter screen, but I never look at it. For search, it's been proven that search works well on distributed networks. Google is a good example. There's no reason an equivalent search function couldn't be created for blogs or feeds, in fact last week I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/09/141354.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about features that would make search much better for distributed systems. All are technologically possible and none are implemented on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There will come a time when Twitter shuts down. But it's hard to imagine that day coming for the network of RSS feeds. It's been wishful thinking for TechCrunch and the VCs and BigCos they serve, a kind of wet dream that open systems will bend to the will of tech titans, that vast wealth is what makes the nets work, but it hasn't happened, even though they've been reporting its demise for a decade now. Really it has been that long! You can even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/reader/about/&quot;&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; the beating heart of the RSS network, and it routes around the damage, quickly.  (A corollary to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Gilmore&quot;&gt;Gilmore's Law&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why Mastodon didn't use RSS, I think they should have. Then the power of the two open distirbuted nets would combine, there would be more interfaces, greater know-how among developers, and more choice for users. I have to dig into it. I think Johannes' theory depends on using Mastodon as the counter-example to Twitter, because while Mastodon is strong and growing, it hasn't withstood the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/03/30/rssOnTheDesktop15YearsLater.html&quot;&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt; that RSS has. I suspect it will. And I also suspect it will still be running when Twitter is gone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I really appreciate his post, no sarcasm. It's great when we step outside the silos and use our own disparate tools to discourse about things that matter.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="As I wrote in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1028630757856751616&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Johannes Ernst is smart and brave. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://upon2020.com/blog/2018/08/why-decentralized-social-networking-never-makes-it-ever-heard-of-crossing-the-chasm/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; decentralized networks never make it, and there are reasons for this. I agree, in a way, but ultimately think his theory is wrong. Because &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+decentralized&amp;t=hi&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;decentralized&lt;/a&gt; networks have blossomed and survived, and imho will still be operating when the silos are gone." created="Mon, 13 Aug 2018 01:05:45 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/08/12/010536.html#a010545"/>
