        "description": "The prospect-dense Birmingham lineup put together a 4-1 victory | Photo by Michael Wade/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Yesterday’s Dong City turned into a Dong Desert, Logan Glass the sole Sox to go deep on a 2-3 day   \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nBox score link game one\nTobias Myers is 24 years old and a recent waiver claim, so it’s hard to really judge him based on his five appearances with the Knights so far. However, through five starts, he has four losses, including the L in game one of the Knights/Bulls doubleheader on Friday. Between three AAA teams this year (Sox, Guardians, Giants), he has a record of 1-13. Both runs he allowed in his two-inning cameo scored in the first on a two-run dong.\nEvery subsequent Knights pitcher allowed at least one run. Zack Muckenhirn struck out three over two innings and walked none but gave up a solo shot, a rehabbing Aaron Bummer allowed two runs on a pair of singles and a double, and Tanner Banks also gave up a solo shot over two innings.\nIt was a three-hit day at the plate for the Knights, two of those coming in the third off the bats of Zach Remillard and DJ Burt, who doubled and singled, respectively. Burt’s single drove in Remillard and Craig Dedelow, who had walked, giving Charlotte their only two runs of the game.\n\n\nGo DJ, that's our DJ!  DJ Burt with his first Triple-A RBI! He drives in two runs! pic.twitter.com/14StDTT655— Charlotte Knights (@KnightsBaseball) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nTyler Neslony singled with one out in the seventh to put a cap on the offense; or, rather, Micker Adolfo did that when he grounded into a game-ending double play one batter later. Neslony is now 13-for-30 over an eight-game hitting streak.\nAlso, this happened:\n\n\nEver see a play like this before? Watch the bat &amp; the ball. Watch the bat hit the ball. Say what????@MiLB | @EliasSports | @SportsCenter  Ruling: Walk &amp; 2-unassisted pic.twitter.com/qorIjLHaeR— Charlotte Knights (@KnightsBaseball) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nBox score link game two\nGame two also ended in a loss, but it was closer than you would think after hearing that their opener, JB Olsen, allowed six runs in 1 ⅓ innings. In fact, if they had limited the Bulls to just that, they would have tied and had a chance to win at home; alas, Andrew Perez gave up a leadoff home run in the third to Tristan Gray, who is now tied with a few other players around the minors with 30 total dongs on the season. Rafael Dolis and Kade McClure both held the Bulls scoreless, McClure going three one-hit, one-walk innings and striking out five, but the rally fell just short.\nThe Knights answered the single first-inning Bulls run with a run of their own, Laz Rivera doubling from the leadoff spot and scoring on Lenyn Sosa’s single. They responded to the 7-1 deficit in the third inning by scoring four; Nick Ciuffo and Xavier Fernández singled and Rivera was hit by a pitch to load the bases with nobody out, and after a Sosa strikeout and Carlos Pérez foul pop fly, Blake Rutherford came through with a station-to-station RBI single. Yolbert Sánchez then swatted his 11th double to clear the bases and make the score just 7-5 Bulls.\nTrouble brewed again for the Bulls in the sixth, again instigated by Ciuffo and Fernández, whose single and double led off the inning and pushing across a run, 7-6. DJ Burt singled in Rivera’s stead to put runners on the corners with one out, but Sosa popped up and Pérez grounded into a double play to end their chances. They did not threaten in the seventh.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nBox score link\nProject Birmingham lurches ever onward, now the winners of two in a row after their victory in extras last night. The pitching excelled: lefty Garrett Schoenle went four innings, allowing one run on two hits, and Emilio Vargas was ever so slightly better, matching Schoenle in innings but shutting the Biscuits down on just one hit. Both struck out five. Fraser Ellard pitched around two walks for a scoreless ninth and the save.\nMoisés Castillo scored the Barons’ first run of the game, tying the game in the third after a leadoff walk and Yoelqui Céspedes’ 27th double of the season. It stayed a 1-1 game until the top of the seventh; Tyler Osik singled and looked like he was going to be stranded there until JJ Muno drew a two-out walk. Castillo also walked and Bryan Ramos cleared the bases with a single, aided by the third baseman’s error. The 4-1 lead would hold and the Barons are 55-69.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nBox score link\nThe Dash learned what the Knights already knew: it’s hard to win a baseball game when you only get three hits as a team. It’s even harder if you give up seven runs at the same time.\nThe Grasshoppers’ half of the first opened on an ill omen, shortstop Taishi Nakawake’s error; the next batter hit a single and pitcher Luis Moncada made an error of his own that led to a run scoring. Another came in on a single, still with nobody out, before Moncada settled enough to retire the side.\nThe 2-0 hole deepened to 4-0 after one more Moncada inning that featured a single, double, and sacrifice fly; he pitched a scoreless third but the damage was done. In the fourth, Everhett Hazelwood entered, injured his shoulder, and left with a 3-0 count to his first batter faced; Chase Plymell walked the guy for him but politely waited until the next inning to give up two runs.\nIt was 7-0 after Nick Gallagher’s two-inning, one-run appearance, walking three and striking out none. Skylar Árias pitched the eighth, only his second scoreless outing in his last eight overall.\nThis is not the first time the Dash have gathered fewer than four hits in recent weeks. Tonight, the no-hitter went to the sixth, when Caberea Weaver led off with a double and scored two ground outs later, the only Dash run of the game. Andy Atwood and Nakawake singled with two outs in the seventh, and other than a handful of walks, that was about it. They are 56-68.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nBox score link\nThe Cannon Ballers and Hillcats combined for nine hits and three runs over 10 innings with Kannapolis coming out on top 2-1. Dylan Burns made his third start at the level and went five innings for the third time, walking four but only giving up one run. Ty Messer was lethal in relief, striking out four and walking one in three innings with no other baserunners, and Frander Veras mowed through two scoreless innings for the win, striking out four as he did so.\nThe Ballers trailed 1-0 from the third until the eighth, when Logan Glass led the inning off with his sixth home run of the year and only dinger of the day in the entire Sox minors.\nTied 1-1 in the 10th, they punished the Hillcats for only having one hit after the third inning. Samil Polanco started the inning at second base and took third when Jayson González struck out and simultaneously reached first on a passed ball. Glass then came through again, his double scoring Polanco for the eventual 2-1 victory. After Misael González struck out and Brooks Baldwin was intentionally walked, loading the bases with one out, Wilber Sánchez popped out and Troy Claunch struck out to keep the margin thin, but all’s well that ends well (?).\nLike the Barons and one off from the Dash, the Ballers are 55-69.",

        "description": "Rick Scuteri-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Offense unable to support strong outing by Eric Lauer Box Score\nThe Brewers’ offense continued to scuffle on Friday night, managing just one run on a bases-loaded walk in a 2-1 loss to the Diamondbacks.\nEric Lauer delivered a strong start, working 6 2⁄3 innings and allowing two runs on six hits with five strikeouts. Most notably, Lauer did not issue any walks or allow any home runs, which have been categories of underwhelming performance for the left-hander since June.\nUnfortunately, those two runs were too much for the Brewers to overcome. After Zach Davies held them scoreless for four-plus innings, they scratched across their only run in the top of the fifth on three consecutive walks.\nThe lead proved to be short-lived. Lauer’s only blemish came in the bottom of the fifth, when he allowed his two runs on four straight hits.\nHoby Milner relieved Lauer with two outs in the seventh and stranded a pair of runners. He then returned to work a scoreless eighth inning.\nA one-out single by Kolten Wong brought the go-ahead run to the plate in the ninth against Ian Kennedy, but Willy Adames lined out and Rowdy Tellez grounded out to seal the loss.\nThe defeat drops the Brewers to 7.5 games behind the Cardinals in the NL Central and four games back in the Wild Card race. If they cannot salvage a split in this four-game series with Arizona, it may be a nail in the coffin for their postseason hopes.",

Public libraries transformed into cooling centers, and mutual aid groups prepared frozen water bottles to offer relief to unhoused residents. Food vendors were still on the streets, despite describing heat that can reach 115F (46C) inside a sweltering truck.Heading into a holiday weekend, southern California is grappling with its hottest weather of the year, with no relief in sight. Even in a city known for its heat, the triple digit temperatures in some towns around Los Angeles are breaking records, and advocates worry that the extremes will prove deadly for workers and others forced to be outside during the hottest hours of the day.

        "description": "Smell that testosterone. | Photo by Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Twins didn’t do what they could have offensively, and that left an opening for Chicago to win in the most 2022 Whte Sox way. Tonight’s game began well for the Twins, yet some missed opportunities (have you heard that story before) led to a truly irritating walkoff loss. Starter Sonny Gray left a little early but will hopefully be OK. Inning-by-inning notes:\n1: Not scheduled to start this game, but being used as the “opener,” is reliever Joe Kelly. Since converting to the bullpen full-time in 2017, he’s started two games, and this is #2.\nHe gives up a leadoff Luis Arraez single down the third-base line, which LF Leury Garcia “makes a meal of” (Kris Atteberry phrase for “error.”) Walks Carlos Correa, gets a fielder’s choice, walks Jose Miranda. Then Nick Gordon is up. Then Nick Gordon RULES. Double and two RBI.\nUnfortunately, with runners on second and third and one out, both Gio Urshela and Jake Cave elect to go down looking. That really shouldn’t happen, ever, and especially not against a last-minute “opener” who’s scuffled in the inning.\nIt might haunt, we’ll see.\nSonny Gray gives up a two-out single to still-good Jose Abreu, and that’s it for Chicago. Twins 2-0\n2: Here’s the scheduled starter, young Davis Martin. Arraez gets a two-out double off him and Correa another walk, but then Garcia makes a nice catch on a deep Max Kepler fly to end things. Lookit! Kepler almost got a big hit! That’s improvement from where he’s been lately!\nAJ Pollock goes greedy trying to stretch a single, and Jake Cave/Gordon nail him at second, hahahaha\n3: Martin plunks Miranda and Gordon GIDPs. Is that sentence short enough for you? Gray gets Chicago on nine pitches. That is also a short sentence. Making this a short paragraph.\n4: Cave gets the hit he SHOULD HAVE got three innings ago, this time it doesn’t matter.\nAfter Andrew Vaughn leads off with a double and reaches third with two outs, Atteberry brings up an odd stat: the Twins are 14th in the AL with RISP and two outs, while the White Sox are 3rd.\nWell, Yasmani Grandal pops one to short that nobody can catch because of a shift. Gray walks Pollock, Leury Garcia hits a quickly-fielded single that loads the bases, and Gray plunks Josh Harrison to tie the game. All with two outs. How clutch, I guess. Those called strike 3s in the first are Haunting right now, 2-2\n5: It seems like every so often the Twins face a mediocre rookie pitcher and can do absolutely nothing against him. It’s certainly been the case tonight with Martin.\nWannabe 525 last inning noted that “Well Gray’s little hammy snafu at the end of the third might be contributing to this little scare,” and it seems to be the case; Gray is gone after 59 pitches. Michael Fulmer is in. Vaughn and Abreu have a two-out threat going before Fulmer strikes out Grandal to stop it, whew.\n6: Give Martin the Cy Young, I guess. The Twins certainly aren’t giving him anything to worry about.\nClimbing high into the sun with Griffin Jax, USAF. A few balls are hit with love but fall down in gloves.\n7: Onetime starter Reynaldo Lopez hasn’t given up a homer in 49.1 innings of relief this season. Make it 50.1. There was something in the air this night, Twins bats have fright, Reynaldo.\nIt’s Jhoan Duran in to face the top of Chicago’s batting order. Chicago says “if you get us out, you take away the biggest part of we” and Duran says “I don’t want your love.”\n8: It’s a Kepler hit! A single off Jimmy “Not The Greek” Lambert which Harrison throws into the dugout, getting Herr Von Kepler to second. Miranda lines a single, Kepler stops at third, recent speedster acquisition Billy Hamilton runs for Jose. Gordon hits a sharp grounder which might have been thrown home if 2B Romy Gonzalez didn’t bobble the ball; he recovers to throw out Gordon instead. Hamilton gets a lousy jump trying to steal third and is tagged on the slide, the Twins are done soon after.\nCaleb Theilbar, who usually throws good curveballs, lets one dangle deliciously and it's whomped by backup catcher Yasmani Grandal and his mighty .569 OPS. This baby’s all tied up 3-3\n9: Time for former friend (if far too briefly) Liam Hendricks. Twins astrologer Gilberto Celestino manages a one-out single, but that’s it.\nIncidentally. the crowd is doing “the wave.” Liam Hendricks is Australian. At most Australian sports buildings, anyone who tries to start “the wave” will be ejected from the building and permanently banned. This is absolutely correct.\nThe other trade deadline relief pickup, Jorge Lopez, tries to makes this ManfredBall.\n... and then, as Wannabe put it, “things just turned to shiesse at the end.”\n(Yeah, these notes are kinda live, but sometimes at the end of close games, I kick back and follow the game instead of making notes. Also, this one sucked at the end, so I sat back and cracked a beverage before finishing this.)\nAlright, here’s how it went...\nLopez got one out, then allowed a single by non-good-hitter Gonzalez and another by Elvis Andrus.\nLopez hit Vaughn. Loading the bases with one out, which HE DIDN’T WANT TO DO. Vaughn got all “YO BRO” and the White Sox jumped out of the dugout. Which meant the Twins jumped out of the dugout.\nAll the while, Abreu is trying to cool some dumb egos. He’s only a great, professional hitter, who wants the chance to walk-off the game, what the f*** is up with this stupid.\nOnce things chill out, Lopez hits Abreu on the elbow. Abreu rips off his jersey in triumph, the fireworks start.\nExcept the Twins challenge the play. Gladden says he thinks the ball hit the knob end of Abreu’s bat. He’s right. The call’s overturned, it’s a foul, 0-1. Gladden is loudly righteous.\nThen Abreu lines one up the middle. Lopez tries to glove it, and only succeeds in deflecting it a little. Trying to hurry, Gordon fields it and makes a bad flip to Correa, who can’t recover his balance in time to even try a return throw to first.\nTwims lose. And after Cleveland lost, so there was a chance to move back into a tie for first, here.\nStuds: I guess Gordon’s first-inning RBIs double counts, although his at-bats weren’t very good after that. Nobody on the Twins really shined tonight, and none were terrible (although Lopez kinda got close to terrible there at the end).\nDuds: the entire White Sox macho mindset during that idiotic “leave the dugout RARRRR!” moment at the end. Yeah, guys, you were expected to easily win this division. And you haven’t, because your manager is completely out of touch (and also fighting serious health worries right now, so we have to take a pause at picking on him), and you’ve approached the whole season like you were entitled to win, and played some really sloppy ball.\nSo, show some Biggg Mannnly Energy about a pitcher who didn’t mean to hit one of your guys, and would almost certainly lose the game because of it (which he did) — holy crap, how ridiculously dumb. This is the kind of bulls**t that makes non-jocks on the fence about sports decide that they’re all stupid.\nI’ll be disappointed if Minnesota loses to Cleveland in this division race. But I’ll think Cleveland earned it by being more consistent over 162 games. I’ll just be disgusted if these White Sox somehow come back to win the division. I liked the Ozzie Guillen Sox. I don’t like these ones.\nCOTGs go to Wannabe for those mentioned above, also artistformerlyknownasGoose for “Great. We lost twice” and this quotation of where the phrase “pulling out all the stops” comes from (it involves pulling an organ, and get your mind out of the gutter).\nTommorow’s game will be at 6:15, and has Chicago’s ace Dylan Cease against trade acquisition Tyler Mahle coming off the IL (probably). See you in the gamethread, maybe!",

        "description": "Over-ripe tomatoes are to be treasured, not tossed in the bin. In fact, the riper, the better for this super-refreshing cold soupSalmorejo is a soup that’s similar to gazpacho, but easier to make and just as delicious. Tomatoes become more tasty the riper they get, so treasure, don’t trash, any squishy ones you might have in the house. (Keep them out of the fridge, too, incidentally, both to maximise their flavour and to prevent them from turning watery and woolly.) When tomatoes are at peak ripeness, as they are at this time of year, it’s time to make salmorejo.Stale bread thickens this soup, making it a satiating starter, with a lovely, velvety texture, though, as a “whole” food chef, I use wholegrain sourdough instead of the traditional white bread. Wholemeal bread still creates a delicious texture without affecting the colour too much, and means we are also saving the most nutritious part of the grain – that is, the germ and the bran – from being wasted.

The Archives had become aware earlier this year it did not have everything from Meadows after seeing what he had turned over to the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021.”",

        "description": "Bases-loaded HBP? Bases-loaded fielder’s choice? José Abreu won a game for the White Sox in two weird ways on Friday. | Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images\n    \n\n  It was a wild ninth, but the South Siders are creeping closer What an ending!\nThe White Sox, in a close game throughout, beat division rival Minnesota in a comeback, 4-3 win Friday night. And the win came in a dramatic walk-off from José Abreu in the bottom of the ninth — not once, but twice. \nWith the bases loaded and one out, the veteran appeared to be hit by Jorge Lopez’s first pitch for the walk-off win, only for it to be overturned and called a foul ball. Just one pitch later, Abreu had a walk-off RBI fielder’s choice to secure the win. That puts the Sox back at .500 and just two games behind Minnesota for second and three games behind Cleveland for the ALC lead.\n\n\nWhite Sox WALK IT OFF!   pic.twitter.com/OikHKxKXj0— White Sox Talk (@NBCSWhiteSox) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nTaking the first of nine games left in the season against Minnesota was key, and both teams knew what this first game meant. Emotions flared in the ninth and both benches cleared after Andrew Vaughn was hit by a pitch near his head to load the bases. Acting manager Miguel Cairo was ejected in the scrum, and Lance Lynn memorably “hopped” the dugout railing to jaw at Lopez over the pitch.\nThe win was the third straight for the Sox, who have won three of four since Cairo took over. \nEveryone in the lineup contributed with at least one hit. Veteran Yasmani Grandal, like Abreu, played a huge role in the victory, at the plate and behind it. Grandal went 2-for-4 with a homer and two RBIs, scoring two of his team’s four runs. He also gunned down Twins pinch-runner Billy Hamilton at third base, with one out in the eighth — a very key play, and no small task. And as often happens, right after a big defensive play comes an even bigger play at the plate; in this case, Yaz tied the game up with a solo shot:\n\n\nYaz please!#ChangeTheGame | @NBCSChicago pic.twitter.com/l1sJ8KChZ3— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nDavis Martin threw five scoreless innings out of the bullpen after Joe Kelly allowed two runs in the first as the opener for the game. Martin settled things down, allowing just three hits and a walk with two strikeouts. \nWith Cleveland in free-fall and having big injuries dealt to its rotation, the White Sox have trimmed their deficit in the division as quickly as the sweep by Arizona built it. \nTomorrow night in a slightly earlier (6 p.m.) start, prime Cy Young candidate Dylan Cease takes the mound to hopefully bring the Sox a step closer.\n\nNo Six Pack, so here’s your game polls:",

        "description": "Matt Mervis | Bryon Houlgrave/The Register / USA TODAY NETWORK\n    \n\n  South Bend lowers their magic number to 1. Matt Mervis keeps on slugging in an Iowa win. The Pelicans come out on top.  I only caught the beginning of these games tonight, as my Fridays are tied up with my daughter’s cheerleading for the foreseeable future. But it looks like the Cubs did well. \nIowa Cubs\nThe Iowa Cubs sunk the Columbus Clippers (Guardians), 9-7.\nStarter Matt Swarmer went 5+ innings and allowed four runs on seven hits. Swarmer had shut out the Clippers for five innings, but he let the first four batters of the sixth inning reach base and all of them came around the score. Swarmer walked one and struck out four.\nBrendan Little got the win in relief. Little gave up just one hit over two innings, but it was a solo home run by Brayan Rocchio in the seventh inning. Little struck out two and walked one.\nIt was a perfect bottom of the ninth for Ben Leeper, who got the save. Leeper struck out one.\nFirst baseman Matt Mervis hit a solo home run in the top of the fifth inning. It was Mervis’ 29th home run this year and eighth with Iowa. He later tied the game 7-7 in the top of the ninth with a two-out RBI double. Mervis finished the evening going 2 for 5 with the double and the homer. He scored twice and had two runs batted in.\nCenter fielder Darius Hill went 2 for 5 with a double. He scored the first run of the game in the third inning when catcher John Hicks doubled him and Levi Jordan home.\nHicks went 2 for 4 with the double and a walk. Hicks also singled home Mervis with the go-ahead run in the top of the ninth. He had three total RBI and he scored once.\nJordan went 2 for 4 with a double and a walk as well. He just scored the one run.\nRight fielder Brennen Davis had his best game since coming back from back surgery, reaching base five times. Davis went 2 for 2 with two walks and he was hit by a pitch once. Davis scored once. \nMervis’ home run.\n\n\nWe cannot confirm that this ball has landed yet...Mash Mervis for the second night in a row goes deep against the Clippers! pic.twitter.com/ElZZIGg3v7— Iowa Cubs (@IowaCubs) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nHere’s his double.\n\n\nHe does it all! Matt Mervis is your @EMCInsurance Player of the Game with his solo home run and this game-tying double in the ninth. pic.twitter.com/P7k0Bapmaa— Iowa Cubs (@IowaCubs) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nTennessee Smokies\nThe Tennessee Smokies were tamed by the Mississippi Braves, 9-7.\nJordan Wicks made his first start since leaving his August 20 start after one inning with an injury. Wicks seemed to be just fine as he pitched three innings, allowed no runs and just one hit. He struck out three and walked no one. He only threw 38 pitches, but 24 of them were strikes.\nKyle Johnson gave up four runs in the bottom of the eighth inning and got the loss. Johnson’s final line was four runs on three hits and two walks over two-thirds of an inning. Johnson also hit one batter. He struck out one. \nHarrison Wenson got to relieve Johnson. The normal catcher walked one batter and then got a fly out to left with the bases loaded to end the threat.\nCatcher Jake Washer hit a solo home run in the second inning. It was his first home run in Double-A and 15th this season. Washer was 1 for 4.\nDH Nelson Maldonado connected with the bases empty for his tenth home run this year and fifth with Tennessee. Maldonado went 2 for 4.\nRight fielder Yonathan Perlaza had two RBI singles and a sacrifice fly for three total RBI on the night. He was 2 for 3 with a stolen base. \nCenter fielder Zach Davis stole four bases tonight in a 3 for 5 evening. Davis scored twice.\nSouth Bend Cubs\nThe South Bend Cubs won their fifth-straight game, 2-1 over the Lansing Lugnuts (Athletics). The win reduced South Bend’s magic number for a second-half title to one.\nKohl Franklin got the win with 5.2 innings, allowing just one run on three hits. He struck out seven and walked no one. \nBrad Laskey threw 1.1 innings, Joe Nahas pitched one inning, and Sheldon Reed pitched the ninth to get the save. Reed allowed one runner on an error (not his) but no other baserunners. He struck out two.\nShortstop Kevin Made hit a two-run home run in the fifth inning that accounted for all of South Bend’s runs. Made went 1 for 4.\nBeloit won, so South Bend did not clinch the second-half title tonight. They will with their next win or Beloit’s next loss. There are eight games left in the season. \nHighlights:\n\nMyrtle Beach Pelicans\nThe Myrtle Beach Pelicans rubbed the Charleston RiverDogs (Rays) noses in it, 8-4.\nNick Hull started and threw three scoreless innings. He gave up one hit and walked one. He struck out two. Hull hit one batter. \nThe win went to Saul Gonzalez, who gave up just one unearned run on two hits over 3.2 innings. Gonzalez walked two and struck out two.\nSecond baseman Josue Huma was 2 for 4 with two RBI and one run scored.\nThird baseman James Triantos went 2 for 5 and scored once.\nLeft fielder Ezequiel Pagan was 2 for 5.",

        "description": "Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Dodgers lose three straight for the first time since June The Dodgers were defeated 7-1 by the San Diego Padres and dropped their third straight game in the series opener at Dodger Stadium. Dustin May had never allowed more than three runs in a start through 33 major-league games until Friday night. Three multi-run home runs against May put the Dodgers in a 7-0 hole they couldn’t dig their way out of. \nMayday\nMay had poor command in his third start for the Dodgers since returning from Tommy John surgery. He allowed a pair of two-run home runs in the third, walked five and hit two batters. \nMay walked Juan Soto and Manny Machado consecutively with one out in the top of the first. May jammed Josh Bell with an effective cutter to induce a pop out and the second out. Then the comeback kid struck out Jake Cronenworth looking with a curveball to end the threat.\nMissed Opportunities with RISP\nThe Dodgers only mustered two hits off Darvish through the first seven frames, and they left six men on base. \n\n\nYu Darvish, Pretty 77mph Curveball.   pic.twitter.com/fQUYeKVXMO— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nThe first base hit off old friend Darvish came on a Max Muncy leadoff single in the bottom of the second. Chris Taylor drew a walk, and Cody Bellinger got a big opportunity with a runner in scoring position. Darvish struck out Bellinger swinging with his four-seam fastball, and he escaped unscathed. \nThe Padres got to May for four runs on two home runs in the top of the third. Manny Machado hit his 25th home run of the season, a two-run shot to left-center field to give the Padres a 2-0 lead. Then Brandon Drury doubled their lead with a two-run home run of his own. \nJustin Turner’s two-out double in the fourth was his 30th double of the season to extend his current hitting streak to 12 games. Gallo got another opportunity, but he was called out on strikes. \nAfter May’s fifth walk of the night, Dave Roberts pulled him in the top of the sixth. Heath Hembree came in out of the Dodgers’ bullpen, and things started off well. He struck out Ha-Seong Kim and Austin Nola. It looked as though Hembree was going to get out of the inning. Then Jurickson Profar hit a three-run homer to center field to open the game wide open 7-0 for the Padres. \nPhil Bickford pitched two scoreless innings, but the Dodgers’ bats never woke up until it was too late. The Dodgers had all but given up when they brought in Hanser Alberto to pitch the ninth. \n\n\nHanser Alberto has now appeared in seven games as a pitcher — the most-ever by a position player in one season.— Dodger Insider (@DodgerInsider) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Dodgers did end up getting on the board in the bottom of the ninth thanks to a Justin Turner double and a Gallo RBI single off Nabil Crismatt. \nFriday particulars\nWP — Yu Darvish (12-7): 7 IP, 2 H, 0 ER, 2 BB, 9 K, 111 pitches (78 strikes)\nLP — Dustin May (1-2): 5 IP, 4 H, 4 ER, 5 BB, 5 K, 87 pitches (53 strikes)\nHR — Manny Machado (25), Brandon Drury (25), Jurickson Profar (13)\nStolen Base Count: 84\nUp next\nWhile the series opener featured a battle of right-handed starters, the follow-up on Saturday is the left-handed version.

        "description": "Rick Scuteri-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Last night it was a shutout. Tonight it was a one run win. In this homestand, the Arizona Diamondbacks are getting it done every which way. According the the Bally Sports broadcast, the last time the Arizona Diamondbacks won by a score of two-to-one was 2019. It is evident that the winds are changing for the Major League ballclub, and they are getting the job done every which way this homestand. After getting destroyed by the Philadelphia Phillies by a score of eighteen-to-two in the finale of the previous series, they have held the Milwaukee Brewers to a single run and twenty three strikeouts in the first two games of this series. As a result of their strong play as of late, they now sit only 5 games off of .500 with just about a month left to play.\n\nTonight was another brisk pitcher’s duel resulting in a game time of two hours and fifty one minutes. Zach Davies took the mound for Arizona with the task of playing spoiler against the Milwaukee Brewers who are fighting for a playoff position. Davies has been respectfully reliable since returning from the injured list on August 1st despite being unable to complete the sixth inning.\n\nDavies had to pitch through traffic in the second and fourth innings, but the scoring did not begin until the fifth. With his pitch count above ninety, Torey Lovullo lifted him for Kyle Nelson after giving up a single to Willy Adames, the sixth hit he had allowed on the evening.   His final line was six hits, one walk, five strikeouts, and one earned run. That run scored only because Kyle Nelson struggled in his appearance and walked three batters in a row which allowed Adames to stroll to home. \n\nNo matter, because Arizona finally broke through Eric Lauer in the bottom half of that inning and scored two runs to take the lead. The Diamondbacks did not have anything going against him prior to that point with the only hit being an Emmanuel Rivera single in the second. Christian Walker and Emmanuel Rivera began the comeback with consecutive doubles to begin the bottom of the fifth. Rivera’s double tied the game, and Jake McCarthy singled him home to give Arizona a two-to-one lead. Stone Garrett kept the barrage going and singled to left field, but Lauer quickly escaped further damage with a double play and a popout to newcomer Wilmer Difo to end the inning. That strangely put the win in Kyle Nelson’s hands, undeserving as he may be.\n\nThe following innings were smooth sailing with not much in the way of offensive action for both teams. Reyes Moranta, Kevin Ginkel, Joe Mantiply, and Ian Kennedy all pitched scoreless innings to secure a guarantee of at least a series split with the Milwaukee Brewers.   Milwaukee now sits seven and a half games behind the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Central, and they fall further outside of the Wild Card chase. Arizona is nine and a half back, and despite their spectacular play of late it would take something miraculous for them to make up that ground. However, regardless of if they can pull that off or not, and I do not believe that they can, it has been incredible to watch them on this homestand. They almost swept the Philadelphia Phillies, who do currently hold a Wild Card spot, but dropped the series finale by sixteen runs. Instead of letting that beating cause them to spiral, they put their nose to the grindstone and have taken the first two against the Brewers. Winds are changing indeed and the youth movement is here. Now if only we could find Madison Bumgarner a boat....\n\n  \n        \n      FanGraphs\n      9/2/22 Arizona Diamondbacks (2) vs. Milwaukee Brewers (1)\n  \n\n  \n        \n  \n\nA handful of Sedona red comments from Jim in regards to Kyle Nelson’s “win”. It is impossible to argue with this logic, so you can join the petition in the comments below. See you next weekend everyone!",

        "description": "Teenager Charlie must journey to another world in this transporting tale with echoes of HP Lovecraft and The Wizard of OzOnce upon a time there was a boy called Charlie. His mother died in a terrible accident when he was young, and his father turned to drink, but Charlie grew up to be a good, strong, clever young man. The sort who helps strangers in need – such as the misanthropic Mr Bowditch, who has an equally elderly dog and a crumbling property. Which, as this is a Stephen King novel, sits on a tunnel leading to a mysterious world in need of saving from a horrifying evil.King wrote Fairy Tale in the thick of the pandemic after, he writes, seeing a mental image of “a vast deserted city – deserted but alive … the empty streets, the haunted buildings, a gargoyle head lying overturned in the street … a huge, sprawling palace with glass towers so high their tips pierced the clouds”. These images, he says, “released the story I wanted to tell” – although it takes him a long time to get there. Fairy Tale starts firmly in our world, as Charlie grieves over his mother’s death, cares for his alcoholic father, slips into a well of bad behaviour and then pulls himself out with good grades and a talent for sport. It’s coming-of-age stuff – although with the promise of something fantastical on the horizon, thanks to the “weird chittering noise” that comes from Mr Bowditch’s shed, and the mysterious tub of gold pellets in his safe.

He has not been place on the Injured List yet, so if he has an injury it’s still being evaluated.\nTop Prospect Performances\nAmarillo SS Jordan Lawlar (#2): 0-for-4, 4 KReno RHP Drey Jameson (#6): 5 IP, 9 H, 5 R (4 ER), 2 BB, 3 K, 90 pitches (56 strikes)Hillsboro 1B Deyvison De Los Santos (#10): 2-for-4, HR (9), 2 RBI, 2 R, K\n\n\nNow would be a good time to say, holy smokes.

Reno’s offense was unable to answer, going 0-for-7 with RISP. Jancarlos Cintron had 3 hits and Buddy Kennedy had 2, but Reno’s only RBI came on Seth Beer’s RBI double in the 8th.\nAA: Amarillo Sod Poodles 2, Frisco RoughRiders 21\nBox Score\nA rough night all around, as Bryce Jarvis delivered another subpar start. Jarvis got touched up for 8 runs (7 earned) in 2 2⁄3 innings on 8 hits, 3 home runs, 1 walk, and 2 strikeouts. Garrett Leonard and Josh Green combined to give up 11 runs in the 6th inning, pushing the game to such a lopsided score that the Sod Poodles account started tweeting about football. Blaze Alexander had 3 hits, including an RBI double in the 3rd inning.\nHigh-A: Hillsboro Hops 5, Tri-City Dust Devils 9\nBox Score\nThe game started off nicely, as Hillsboro plated 4 runs in the 1st inning, but it was downhill from there. A.J. Vukovich doubled home a run and scored on a Deyvison De Los Santos RBI single. Gavin Logan added an RBI double two batters later. The pitching struggled in this game, with Marcos Tineo allowing 5 runs in 2 1⁄3 innings followed by 2 runs in 2 2⁄3 innings from the recently-promoted Listher Sosa. De Los Santos added a long home run to the left of straightaway center, hit off the bat at 105 MPH, in the 5th inning.\nLow-A: Visalia Rawhide 1, Lake Elsinore Storm 10\nBox Score\nVisalia faced a real uphill battle, falling behind 7-0 in the first. Jose Cabrera gave up 9 runs (8 earned) on 4 hits, 4 walks, and 4 strikeouts. The hitters didn’t fare much better, with only 6 hits and 1 walk vs. 11 strikeouts in the game. Manuel Peña had 1 walk in 4 trips to the plate and Ivan Melendez went 1-for-3.",

        "description": "‘Diva’ has good, neutral and bad connotations – but as singers from Maria Callas to Beyoncé have shown, it is a trait of sheer excellenceIt was on the second episode of Meghan Markle’s podcast Archetype, in which she interviewed her girl crush or queen or whatevs, Mariah Carey, that the moment happened: Markle used the word “diva” of Carey, and Mariah replied that Meghan had her own diva moments. The two women moved past the awkwardness such that a regular listener might not even have logged it, had not Meghan extensively editorialised afterwards: “It stopped me in my tracks, when she called me a diva,” Markle said, with great urgency, you can almost hear her leaning forwards. “I started to sweat a little bit. I started squirming in my chair in this quiet revolt. Why would you say that? My mind was spinning with what nonsense had she read or clicked on that made her think that about me.” OK, so clearly Mariah Carey thinks of the word as positive or neutral, while Meghan Markle thinks it is pejorative.The word does indeed have three meanings, good, neutral, evil, like in Dungeons and Dragons. That evolution is natural: “diva” is only used of women, and heavily skewed towards women of colour, to denote, per the editor Marna Nightingale: “Both stubborn and exacting professionally, sometimes dramatic about it, but, and this is important, they’re doing it because they know their stuff and they almost always turn out to be right.” It is rarely used of someone who isn’t creative and charismatic, so it contains an element of awe. This is good diva. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Published later this month by Chelsea Green, Rupert Callender&#8217;s &#8216;What Remains? Life, Death and the Human Art of Undertaking&#8217; is our Book of the Month for September. Salena Godden reviews, finding a great work of craft and beauty, humanity, heart and soul, which is both deeply loving and revolutionary in spirit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon&#8217;t ever be afraid, of anything, ever, because you are already dead. This moment, here, now, this is the moment between the click and the bang&#8230;\n\n\n\nCosmic Trigger, Liverpool, November 2014. I remember it was a heroic weekend, a wild energy and a spirited gathering, brilliant art, big conversations and a momentous performance of the brilliant Cosmic Trigger Play by Daisy Campbell. I was there because I was invited to leap out of a golden apple at the command of Eris, the Goddess of chaos, and perform my poem &#8216;I Want Love&#8217;, and when I came off stage I was told I had pulled my Cosmic Trigger. I had surely pulled something that weekend, everything hurt from dancing and laughing, my cheeks ached from grinning. It was a Discordian revelry. Now looking back as I read about this particular weekend in Callender&#8217;s book, I am realising that this must have been the first time I saw Claire Phillips and Ru Callender, The Green Funeral undertakers, recite these words in the opening ceremony ritual. I seem to remember they were dressed in black, charcoal, the skull on the altar, the grey incense smoke curling in the air, the dignified stillness, maybe this was the first time I heard those bold words: Don&#8217;t be afraid&#8230;you are already dead \n\n\n\nWhat Remains? Life, Death and the Human Art of Undertaking is the compelling story of the world&#8217;s first &#8216;punk undertaker&#8217;. From start to finish Ru Callender draws you in with tenderness and candour. It is a powerful book, a debunking of myths, it is an unlearning of all things we have all seen about undertakers and funeral homes on TV shows. This book follows a journey from rave culture and ritual magic to the early days and first burials of The Green Funeral Company — the eco-friendly funeral directors Ru Callender started with partner Claire Phillips. The book also explores Toxteth Day of The Dead, the building of The People&#8217;s Pyramid — a 23-feet high pyramid built from bricks filled with burned and crushed human bones — and the establishment of Callender, Phillips, Cauty &amp; Drummond: Undertakers to the Underworld with KLF&#8217;s Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond, a partnership between The Green Funeral Company and The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu. \n\n\n\nIf you have a fascination with death and all the big questions around it then this is the book for you. My thoughts about death and dying are not at all morbid or maudlin, I have always had a curiosity about the unsaid and a yearning to listen to or comprehend the quiet around death, the mysteries of death. I&#8217;m interested in language, the words we use around loss, how we make space to honour these feelings, the meaning of all of this living and dying we must all do. Callender&#8217;s book dissects and explores this masterfully. This is an exquisite exploration of death work, death ritual, death politics, death truth and lies. Here is the human art of undertaking, the key words, human and art. This book is so generous with calm explanations and explorations of what might happen to us, what we might face when a loved one is going and then gone. What is done when we are undone. It is unsettling as much as it is comforting and it is all too brutally true.\n\n\n\n&#8230;the way we have allowed ourselves to be led away from the presence of our dead, the way we have allowed our rituals of farewell to become meaningless – an echo of a faded belief system, someone else&#8217;s gestures and beliefs. It lies in our collusion that things like an expensive coffin or thousands of pounds worth of flowers, or a line of Mercedes limousines to take us to the doors of the crematorium can cover for feelings of guilt…None of this honours them and it doesn&#8217;t serve our grief either.\n\n\n\nWhat Remains? begins at the beginning with an ending, with a childhood trauma. As a young boy Ru Callender lost his father. His writing about this early loss is candid and honest: he did not get to go to the funeral. &#8216;My absence at my father&#8217;s funeral is the single most important driver behind why I am an undertaker.&#8217; I shared this experience; I lost my father at age nine, and I have also wished I could have gone to the funeral. This sharing moment in the book resonated with me in a deeply personal way, highlighting how important it is to allow children to be part of big conversations. Much later in the book Callender describes children hanging off the coffin handles and of Viking-style funerals; of how children fire flaming arrows at their father&#8217;s funeral pyre and how because of this, those children have been gifted a memory of inclusion in that otherwise traumatic event. My heart also broke reading the chapter titled &#8216;The Unthinkable&#8217; — an incredibly moving, detailed description of a small child&#8217;s funeral and the tenderness for and care of Tallulah:\n\n\n\nIt was an extraordinary time, the week or so in which her body laid in state…Her schoolmates all coming to see her body, the worry and discomfort of all of their parents contrasting so completely with the insouciance of the kids, their absolute normality around her body…it was a ceremony filled with the chatter of children, the singing of familiar nursery songs and, at the end, everyone filed past her open coffin to sprinkle rose petals on her body. By the time Tallulah&#8217;s mother shut her bamboo coffin for the last time, she was already buried under a drift of red petals.\n\n\n\nCallender writes passionately and fiercely about the role of an undertaker and the myriad of people they&#8217;ve worked for and with. He writes about preventable deaths and recalls the death of a local homeless man called Michael. Callender&#8217;s pages on this loss, this failure, this compassion, are so stirring. We are shown how a community spirit rises, how people gather to give Michael a decent and humane send-off.\n\n\n\nWe carried him slowly up the hill, blocking the traffic as we went. We stopped every thirty yards or so to allow other people to carry him…Around eighty people in all carried Michael&#8217;s coffin. Fellow homeless men read poems when we paused, but mostly we simply processed in silence. When we reached the market square, I stood on a bench and said my piece.\n\n\n\nThis book does not tip-toe about death, thankfully. Callender writes in fresh and frank tones about the nature of death. This book explores that nature, our choices, our individuality and our community, the effects of death, fear of the dead and fear of death itself, how that differs, how personal this is to each and every one of us. He writes about the empowerment and healing people might experience when given the freedom to care and wash their dead, to carry and bury their own dead, to process their loss and love for themselves and in their own way and own time. This book rings the bell for change and changing attitudes to how people may wish to honour their dead. Callender delves into death rituals, from the cultural and the magical to the mundane, and it challenges any mystery shrouded around the traditional, conveyor-belt style cremations in stark, sterile concrete buildings.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI was right that this small, immersive approach, intimate and shorn of all formality and the faux Victoriana traditions that characterised the traditional British funeral, was so much better for the families we were helping. I knew it was better to cry with them around their unadorned dead than sell them an expensive coffin. I knew it was better to turn up in a scruffy car and be real, rather than appear in black suit with a fixed patter. But I also knew we were risking so much of ourselves by opening our hearts and our heads, and our very lives, to this unending stream of sadness.\n\n\n\nWhat Remains? is a great work of craft and beauty, humanity, heart and soul. I believe it could be used both as a teaching tool and as a comfort. I find Callender&#8217;s approach to this huge subject deeply loving and moving, but also revolutionary in spirit and courageous. \n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n&#8216;What Remains?&#8217; is published on 15 September.

        "description": "In the pandemic it seemed community cycling was going up another gear, now we get closed lanes and tacks on the roadDuring those long pandemic days, when we had nowhere to go and nowhere to be, my kids and I used to hit the road on our bikes. We would head out on a brand new cycle lane that popped up on a high-traffic road in Shoreham-by-Sea, where we live, as part of government measures to help more people walk and cycle during the pandemic. We would nip to the shops, down to the river or to the local library, and weekend activities were interspersed with quick rides. At the height of the Covid restrictions, taking off spontaneously as a family offered us a sense of freedom that felt liberating.I had never considered allowing my two children, now aged 12 and nine, to ride on the roads before this cycle lane popped up in September 2020, neatly sheltering cyclists from the fast-moving flow of traffic that is a constant on our surrounding roads. To state the obvious, it was the cars that put me off before. If your child is weaving in and out of traffic, one momentary lapse in judgment could be fatal. But the pandemic sparked a shift for us, towards a more sustainable lifestyle. It felt safe to set off on your bike, and the cycle lane became a living, breathing thread of community that stitched nearby towns together. Continue reading...",

Yet they have an easy companionability. He admires how her garden has grown since the start of Covid, she joshes him about him being “too busy” to make the forthcoming celebrations for her and her husband Malcolm’s 50th wedding anniversary. “Well, the holiday was booked … ” Scheffler murmurs apologetically.

        "description": "On Wednesday Jillian Nelson and Ellie Wilson of the Autism Society of Minnesota met MPR News’ digital producer Sam Stroozas and photojournalist Ben Hovland at the MPR booth at the Minnesota State Fair. The plan was simple — set out to record a video from the point of a view of an autistic person at the fair. Nelson, who is autistic herself, led the tour. We began near the haunted house, where Nelson says is one of the loudest corners and the most anxiety-inducing for her. “Typically at this intersection it’s bumper to bumper, you can’t move. You have a lot of visual stuff coming off the haunted house and people coming into the fair,” she said. Nelson doesn’t travel anywhere without her essentials: noise-reducing headphones, fidget toys water (usually from her favorite water bottle) and other sensory tools. At the fair, and in most places, she says she needs to know where her exit is, or a place she can be when she gets too overwhelmed. Depending where she is on the Fairgrounds, she may go to the Lee &amp; Rose Warner Coliseum and watch a horse show or check out the Agriculture Horticulrure building. “I have learned so many random facts simply because I end up in random places to escape,” Nelson said. It’s difficult to make any place completely sensory friendly Wilson said, the executive director of the Autism Society of Minnesota. Nelson explained that Wilson is “one of her people,” a person that knows how to work with her and calm her down during overly stimulating moments. “We have to figure out how to create places within the overall scene for people. We aren’t trying to put people in bubbles or make the perfect experience; it’s about having access to what you need when you need it,” Wilson said. But the difference between Nelson’s brain and one without autism — she can’t filter these sounds out. And she says because she doesn’t “look disabled,” others may react poorly to her. She said typically autistic people are seen as young, white boys but when it shows up in older people, women, or people of color — they may not be treated with the same respect or options. “There’s a perception of what I need to look like as a disabled person and some days it’s just really coming prepared and knowing what you need to survive anything and others … it’s just surviving,” she said.Nelson says she will have a “completely autistic” experience at the fair, and she’s okay with that. She wouldn’t want it any other way.“I am going to over plan, I am going to know where all the quiet places are, I am going to come with a team of people and have a bad of fidgets and an exist strategy if things go sour.”And sometimes they do go sour. Nelson described it like having a computer open with 67 tabs and none of them will close. She’s more in tune than others. While standing for an interview she explained she heard the band, three sets of stroller wheels, dozens of conversations, shoes scuffing, a set of keys jingling and more. Jillian Nelson’s Top Five Tips for Autistically Mastering the Minnesota State Fair:Prep before you visit. Find a map of the fair, know your exits and where you can go to calm down.Remember to pack helpful items. What do you need, what will help you be most at ease?Find your allies. Bring friends with and people you trust that can work with you.Remember to take a break when you need it. Check out the Fraser Sensory building or other places to relax.Eat all the yummy food! Don’t forget to enjoy yourself.",

        "description": "Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Six Yankees on the hot seat; Injury updates; Peraza could impact postseason race; Montas’ ugly start with Yanks; Marlins wanted Gleyber and Peraza at deadline NJ.com | Brendan Kuty: The regular season has seen a lot of ups and downs as the Yankees have seen their AL East division lead shrink from 15.5 games to just five after Friday night’s lifeless loss. With bad play comes criticism, especially in New York. Here are six players who are now on the hot seat as we head towards the finish line. One of them, Josh Donaldson, did more than his share of contributing to failure on Friday with multiple errors and ugly at-bats.\nCBS Sports | Mike Axisa: Oswald Peraza was called up to the majors on Thursday to hopefully provide a spark for the team on both sides of the ball (though that desire only went so far for the Yankees because he didn’t even start in his debut). He was listed as a potential September call up who may have an impact on playoff races. Peraza had a .291/.365/.511 slash line in Triple-A since June 1st with 19 homers on the season.\nNJ.com | Bridget Hyland: The Bombers added Frankie Montas at the MLB Trade Deadline, but he hasn’t had the best start to his career in pinstripes. The righty has an ERA over seven in five starts, which is obviously not what the Yankees were looking for. It’s been said that this is a “worst case scenario” for the Yanks and Montas.\nNY Post | Jon Heyman: Speaking of the Trade Deadline, the Yankees and Marlins were reportedly in talks for a trade that would have shaken things up quite a bit. New York would have acquired 26-year-old starting pitcher Pablo López and infielder Miguel Rojas in exchange for Gleyber Torres and Oswald Peraza. The belief is the Yankees would have traded Torres, but did not want to deal Peraza. This is all an update of Heyman’s previous report of what the Marlins asked for, as they wanted both of Torres and Peraza. \n\nLastly, let’s go rapid-fire through some tweets containing recent injury updates on Andrew Benintendi (forced to leave last night’s game after a painful swing), Anthony Rizzo (out with a back injury but not on the IL), and DJ LeMahieu (playing through pain — perhaps unwisely).\nBenintendi\n\n\nX-rays on the right wrist of OF Andrew Benintendi were negative and he will undergo an MRI tomorrow.— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Benintendi felt “a pop” in his wrist and is experiencing numbness in his fingers, Aaron Boone said. MRI tomorrow.— Bryan Hoch (@BryanHoch) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nRizzo\n\n\nAnthony Rizzo had an epidural. Boone says he hopes Rizzo could return by Tuesday. #Yankees— Brendan Kuty (@BrendanKutyNJ) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nLeMahieu\n\n\nAaron Boone said that DJ LeMahieu's toe injury isn't something that would necessarily get better w/ a few days rest, more of an offseason thing. Pregame, Boone said that the toe was affecting LeMahieu's power at the plate. Sounds like it might be like this the rest of the way.— Brendan Kuty (@BrendanKutyNJ) September 3, 2022",

        "description": "From a spa-and-cycling trail across Slovenia to the coolest energy-saving hotels in Berlin, these getaways tick all the eco boxesThis summer the country’s tourist board launched a new Green Wellness cycling route. A looping cycle trail of nearly 200 miles linking natural spas, it starts in Ljubljana and heads north towards the Austrian border and then south-west towards Croatia, winding through mountains, plains and vineyards.

It’s not surprising, really, given how many forms it comes in, though some are more suited to heating than others. “Single-estate” honey – the kind that comes from a particular plant (acacia or manuka, say) – won’t survive much heat, so save that for spreading on toast, drizzling on yoghurt or making the sort of dressing that steals the salad show.

        "description": "The author’s new novel explores how global events shape individual lives – but nothing prepared him for this ‘dark moment’• Got a question for Ian McEwan?Ian McEwan was on holiday on the remote coast of north-west Scotland when he heard the news that his great friend Salman Rushdie had been attacked in New York. His wife, the writer Annalena McAfee, let out a cry from the next door room in the small hotel where they were staying. The numbness of his first response was quickly followed by a feeling of horrible inevitability: “How could I have been so blind?” Like Rushdie, McEwan had hoped the threat of the fatwa was over. “The tragedy of this is Salman always wanted to get back to having an ‘ordinary’ writing life, and that seemed to have happened,” McEwan says on a video call a week after the incident. The 74-year-old novelist is back in his Cotswolds home, surrounded by books and looking slightly beaten up after his first bout of Covid.The grim effects of coronavirus added to his “sense of visceral disgust” at the violence of the stabbing. “It all seemed one with my own perception of it,” he says. “A colossal weariness and also disgust at the thought that it takes a lot of hatred, a lot of zeal, to push a knife deep into someone’s eye. It is beyond the edge of human cruelty. And only an intact ideology, not available to disprove in any way, could bring you to the point.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "Start with Adam’s post about this podcast. In the podcast, Bill, Joel, and their guest Phil do a great deal to illuminate Adam’s novel The This — if you haven’t read the novel, you should, and if you have read it, you should listen to the podcast because you’ll learn a lot. I certainly did. \n(And if Adam hadn’t warned me, I would have been greatly surprised to hear my name come up in the discussion! As Phil — I think it was Phil — says, Adam and Francis Spufford and I aren’t quite an -ism but we do form a kind of “vector.” I should think more about what that vector is. All I know for sure is that I greatly value my friendship with these two and don’t think that as a writer I am worthy to be mentioned in the same sentence with them.) \nThere are a thousand things I could say about The This, but for now — prompted by the podcast — I just want to talk about the brief final chapter. Because what I think is going on there is Adam playing the role of Alcibiades.\nThat final chapter says, \n\nYou are an old man, living in a European city big for its era, small by later standards, a philosopher, a teacher, a student. You, a subject of the king, have made Spirit the object of your study. You, objectively, wrote a book whose subject is Spirit. The bacterium Vibrio cholera enters your system and propagates through your gut. You experience fever, shivers, severe stomach pains. There is no diarrhoea and no swelling, and initially the physicians are hopeful. But you grow iller. You vomit gall. You cannot urinate. You begin hiccuping violently. You lie in your bed, on your side, the sheets damp from your sweat. You are shaking. You cannot stop hiccuping. You stare at the wall.\n\nThe dying old man is Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and here you should know two things. The first is that a very similar chapter concludes Adam’s earlier novel The Thing Itself, only in that one it’s Immanuel Kant dying. Philosophers die, just as the rest of us do. The second thing you should know is Kierkegaard’s comment that Hegel’s philosophical System is a vast magnificent castle, and he lives in a little shack just outside it. Because all of us live in those little shacks, no matter how glorious our external constructions. \n\nYou are a man, you live a lonely life, you grow old and die. You are a man, you live a life rich with friends and lovers, you grow old and die.\nYou live, you die. Not another person. Nobody can die for you. You have to do this yourself. \n\nThat’s how it is. And here’s how else it is: \n\nYou see, love is not an abstraction. It&#8217;s not a theory or a cosmic force or a slogan or any kind of diffuseness spread across the world. Love is particular. You do not love in general, you love this person, this thing, this life, you love this, this, this, this, this, and this, and this, and this loves you back. This is the only thing in the world, and it is precise and specific and real, and it is everything and infinitude. \n\nWhich brings us to Alcibiades. \nPlato’s Symposium, many scholars over the years have said, — well, here’s one of them, Gregory Vlastos: the “cardinal flaw in Plato&#8217;s theory” is that “it does not provide for love of whole persons, but only for love of that abstract version of persons which consists of the complex of their best qualities. This is the reason why personal affection ranks so low in Plato&#8217;s scala amoris.” But as Martha Nussbaum points out, to say this is to assume that the speech of Diotima in the Symposium, narrated by Socrates and described by him as a view that has “persuaded” him, is Plato’s view. The problem, Nussbaum says, is that that’s not a safe assumption. \nFor after all the participants in this symposium (including Diotima-by-way-of-Socrates) have had their say about the nature of love, Alcibiades shows up, drunk and voluble, and he provides the dialogue&#8217;s final account. Nussbaum: “Diotima connects the love of particulars with tension, excess, and servitude; the love of a qualitatively uniform ‘sea’ with health, freedom, and creativity.” But Alcibiades says this is all horseshit. “Asked to speak about Love, Alcibiades has chosen to speak of a particular love; no definitions or explanations of the nature of anything, but just a story of a particular passion for a particular contingent individual. Asked to make a speech, he gives us the story of his own life: the understanding of eros he has achieved through his own experience.” Asked to speak about Love, that distinguished abstraction, he instead tells stories about how much he loves Socrates — and in that way gives the lie to the account of Love by which Socrates himself has been persuaded. (Alcibiades has no “account of Love” — he doesn’t think it exists.) \nMuch of the The This portrays our various attempts to escape from … well, from this world, this space/time nexus, this life. Just on the pages that immediately precede the one I have quoted from we have the Hegelian Absolute, the timeless aesthetic perfection of Kubla Khan’s “stately pleasure dome,” the cyclical temporality of Joyce’s (and Vico’s) “commodious recirculation” — all ways to answer the question “Is this all there is?” with a strong firm NO. But the brief final chapter of the novel, in which Adam seems to speak in his own voice, rejects all such Systems and schemes as false comfort — or rather, as false and ultimately comfortless. What we have is not the Absolute but the This: this life, this love, and, in the end (there is an end), this death. \nMy view as a Christian is, of course, that they’re all wrong. (A topic for another post, which would begin by quoting Auden’s poem “Friday’s Child.”) But Adam is less wrong than those who seek to escape the this. He sees that, if we would understand our quotidian vale of tears and our place in it, we need poems and novels — accounts of our particulars — more than we need Systems “or any kind of diffuseness spread across the world.” \nAnd maybe that’s the vector where Adam and Francis and I meet: Love calls us to the things of this world. ",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3625906-biden-earns-plaudits-from-progressives-after-anti-trump-speech/",
        "description": "Progressives say President Biden finally used his words.\n\n\n\nDemocrats who have wanted the president to go hard against conservatives ahead of the midterms are praising his speech Thursday, in which he blasted “MAGA Republicans” and suggested former President Trump and those aligned with him pose “a threat to this country.”\n\n\n\nWhile Biden has signaled over the past week or more that he plans to escalate his rhetoric against the GOP heading into Labor Day and the post-holiday sprint to November, liberals are cheering the tactic as long overdue — even if its impact is uncertain.\n\n\n\n“He was just calling out the truth,” said Vicki Miller, who leads the Philadelphia chapter of the grassroots group Indivisible. “The voters I talk to at the doors here in Pennsylvania, they all see what’s happening.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If the president had sugarcoated what he'd said, they'd see it as politician-speak,” she said. “President Biden is just saying what a lot of these voters already know: that everything is on the line.”\n\n\n\nBiden’s address from Independence Hall set into rapid motion the countdown to the fall, when Democrats say democracy itself will be fought over in critical races, with several Republican candidates running explicitly on messaging that denies the results of the last presidential election.\n\n\n\n“MAGA Republicans do not respect the Constitution,” Biden said during his prime-time speech, one of just a handful that he has delivered during his first term in office. “They do not believe in the rule of law. They do not recognize the will of the people. They refuse to accept the results of a free election.”\n\n\n\nLeading up to the event, administration officials said the speech was meant to send a message to all Americans, not just their own side. The White House circulated excerpts in advance that used language stressing personal responsibility for helping to protect the country’s existing governing rules and contended that there are forces working in the other direction. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfter he spoke, many Democrats were relieved that Biden used the bully pulpit to address their top concern and argued that it may have also provided a useful boost to the base.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“He set the table for the midterms in a way that frames it perfectly for Democrats,” said Michael Starr Hopkins, a veteran Democratic campaign strategist. “Either we defeat Trump and his acolytes or democracy as we know it is over.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden had been in a slump for much of the spring and summer, with a series of problems creating a dark cloud over his presidency. But after a run of recent legislative and executive successes, things started to turn around for the incumbent leader, giving what Democrats hope are incentives to come out and vote for his party’s slate in the fall.\n\n\n\nThe speech, timed to the unofficial kickoff to the final dash to the general election, helped crystallize Biden’s commitment to the public, country and office he serves, some Democrats said, not just to spotlight more traditional issues like the economy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This isn’t a policy debate,” said Starr Hopkins. “This is a debate about who we are as a country and where we want to go moving forward. Biden and his White House finally understand that. You see it in his rhetoric, you see it in the White House social media account, but most importantly you feel it in his words.”\n\n\n\nThose who argued Biden needs to be harsher toward the Trump wing of the opposing party, which includes both rank-and-file members and lawmakers who explicitly sought to overturn the 2020 presidential election, are counting on voters responding to a leader who stands up for their basic guaranteed rights.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe failure of the 50-50 Senate to pass voting rights legislation last year was a gut punch to many liberal lawmakers and activists who warned about the imminent threat that could come as soon as the next elections. And absent those legislative protections, Democrats see the sharper rhetoric from the president as at least a step in the right direction.\n\n\n\nIt comes as he transitions from hashing out the more granular details of his policy agenda on Capitol Hill to becoming the top surrogate for the Democratic Party on the campaign trail.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“No one speech is going to decide the midterms,” said Eddie Vale, a Democratic operative and partner at New Paradigm Agency. “But that speech and the issue of democracy is not just about governance. We are also seeing that there are a lot of independents and Republicans who see it as an important issue in the election.”\n\n\n\nBiden, a lifelong moderate, attempted to differentiate the most fervent right-wing strain of the GOP that supports white nationalism and seeks to invalidate elections from Republicans he admires and has in some cases worked with across the aisle for decades. The latter camp ranges from moderate officeholders to people who may check “R” on their voter registration but who gave the current president a chance to defeat Trump last cycle.\n\n\n\nFor all his effort to balance the harshness with unity, many Republicans interpreted the speech differently. They criticized Biden for what they saw as grandstanding and not getting at the core issues of the country, including the cost of living and crime.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome even sought to frame the dramatic backdrop Biden’s advance team chose to frame the president — dark, shadowy red lights and an American flag between uniformed Marines — as reminiscent of a grim time in world history under authoritarianism.\n\n\n\nConservative Fox News host Tucker Carlson, a staunch Biden critic who regularly praises the Trump movement, went as far as to say that the Democratic president was evoking imagery of Nazis, while attempting to defend those in the MAGA movement who he said the president sees as problematic.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Yeah, they’re a threat, says the guy with the blood-red Nazi background and Marines standing behind him,”&nbsp;Carlson&nbsp;said. “It’s totally immoral.”\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Democrats weren’t as concerned with Republicans’ assertions. Some pointed to the escalating problems in Trump World, which came to the surface after the FBI entered the former president’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida during an ongoing investigation, as more motivating for their own base.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile that is happening, Trump, too, is hitting the trail, campaigning and endorsing candidates that fit his own vision for the country. Over the holiday weekend, he’ll be in Pennsylvania, setting up perhaps the starkest contrast to date between the two former presidential rivals in the state that Biden narrowly won.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwo critical races there are likely to serve as a temperature check on where voters stand. Mehmet Oz, the Republican Party’s Senate nominee, and Doug Mastriano, who is running for governor, have both adopted Trump’s ideology, while the Democratic candidates skew more towards the progressive side of their party.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The midterms are Round 2 in the fight between Biden and Trump,” said&nbsp;Starr Hopkins.&nbsp;“The current president is hitting his stride while the former president could be indicted any day now.”",

        "description": "Serena Williams’s swan song reached its apparent finale on Friday evening.\n\n\n\nAfter two emotionally charged victories in the opening rounds of the U.S. Open, Williams was defeated over three sets by Australian Ajla Tomljanovic.\n\n\n\nWilliams is expected to retire after her defeat in the Open, a competition she first won in 1999 at the age of 17.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn August, Williams said she would “evolve away from tennis” after this year’s tournament.\n\n\n\nWilliams has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles — more than any other player, female or male, in the open era. Her record gives her a stronger claim than anyone else to be the greatest tennis player of all time.\n\n\n\nBut she has always been more than just a sports star. A generation of women, especially Black women, have seen in her an inspiration and role model. And some of the most explosive issues in American life, especially relating to race and gender, have swirled around her for years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere are five of her biggest cultural moments.\n\n\n\nBacking Black Lives Matter&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFans cheer for Serena Williams, of the United States, during her match against Anett Kontaveit, of Estonia, during the second round of the U.S. Open tennis tournament Aug. 31, 2022, in New York. Watching 40-year-old Williams defeat the world’s second-ranked player and advance to the third round of the tournament has inspired many older tennis fans. They say her success sends a message that they too can perform better and longer through fitness, practice and grit. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)\n\n\n\nWilliams does not align herself with party politics and has said in the past that she doesn’t vote. In 2016, she said her non-voting stance “goes back to my religion.” She is a Jehovah’s Witness.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut she has not avoided politics in the broader sense.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2015, she declared her support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and her solidarity with its activists.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“To those of you involved in equality movements like Black Lives Matter, I say this: Keep it up. Don’t let those trolls stop you,” Williams wrote in Wired magazine. “We’ve been through so much for so many centuries, and we shall overcome this too.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe cast those views in the context of a bigger battle for equality — and her own status as a trailblazer.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I’m a black woman, and I am in a sport that wasn’t really meant for black people,” she wrote.  \n\n\n\nIn 2020, months after the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked mass protests, Williams told British Vogue that a broader public beyond the Black community now saw “things that have been hidden for years; the things that we as people have to go through.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe told the magazine that in the immediate aftermath of the killing of Floyd, “I had so many people who were white writing to me saying, 'I'm sorry for everything you've had to go through.'\"  \n\n\n\n\"I think for a minute they started — not to understand, because I don't think you can understand — but they started to see,” Williams added. “I was like: Well, you didn't see any of this before? I've been talking about this my whole career. It's been one thing after another.” \n\n\n\nAbuse at Indian Wells — and the 14-year boycott that followed&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA fan holds a sign for Serena Williams, of the United States, after she beat Anett Kontaveit, of Estonia, in the second round of the U.S. Open tennis championships, Wednesday, Aug. 31, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)\n\n\n\nThe Indian Wells Masters, held each spring in California, is considered the second-biggest tennis tournament in the United States after the Open. It’s sometimes known as the “fifth Grand Slam.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut it has bad connotations for Williams and her family.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe story goes back to 2001.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSerena and Venus Williams were both competing in that year’s singles tournament. They ended up scheduled to meet in the semi-final.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA short time before the match, Venus withdrew, citing tendonitis. Deepening the controversy, a vanquished opponent of Venus’s, Russian pro Elena Dementieva, had implied that matches between the sisters were fixed by their father, Richard.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSerena won the final — but was booed by the crowd throughout. Richard Williams, watching the match, said he heard racial slurs being hurled.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a 2015 article for Time magazine, Serena recalled the experience:&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"The false allegations that our matches were fixed hurt, cut and ripped into us deeply. The under­current of racism was painful, confusing and unfair. In a game I loved with all my heart, at one of my most cherished tournaments, I suddenly felt unwelcome, alone and afraid.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn that same article, she portrayed herself as haunted by the experience, saying she had a hard time forgetting “spending hours crying in the Indian Wells locker room … driving back to Los Angeles feeling as if I had lost the biggest game ever — not a mere tennis game but a bigger fight for equality.” \n\n\n\nThe 2015 Time magazine article was also a way to announce her return to the tournament.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe said that the widespread condemnation of a Russian official who had made “racist and sexist” comments about her had “reminded me how far the sport has come, and how far I’ve come too.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere was to be no fairy tale ending, however.  \n\n\n\nWilliams never won the tournament again, and its name still carries the stain from the way she and her family were treated in 2001.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPregnancy highs and lows — and the importance of “being heard”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn this Saturday, Jan. 28, 2017, file photo, United States' Serena Williams holds her trophy after defeating her sister Venus during the women's singles final at the Australian Open tennis championships in Melbourne, Australia. Unbeknownst to fans and foes, Serena Williams was two months pregnant when she won the 2017 Australian Open. (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara, File)\n\n\n\nMost of Williams’s achievements have been played out in the full glare of the world’s media.\n\n\n\nThat was only partially true when she won her 23rd grand slam title, the Australian Open, in early 2017.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat Williams knew but the rest of the world did not was that she was pregnant at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe had found out about her pregnancy two days before the tournament began. Aged 35, she won every match in straight sets, defeating Venus in the final.&nbsp;Her daughter Olympia was born in September 2017.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe aftermath of the birth was traumatic — and eye-opening.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWilliams, who had previously suffered from blood clots, recalled in an essay how, immediately after Olympia’s birth, “I couldn’t get out of bed because my legs were still numb.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe began passing out, and, in moments of semi-lucidity, asked medical staff for a particular kind of drip — heparin — used to treat blood clots.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn her essay, reprinted in Elle magazine in April this year, Williams described her pain intensifying and being wracked with coughs.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe swore that one nurse told her she was talking “crazy” when she demanded to get a CT scan and that “another doctor was supposed to be checking in but I didn’t see him very much. In fact, I saw him only once.” \n\n\n\nWilliams plainly believes her concerns were dismissed, despite her exalted status, in a way that put her life in danger.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"In the U.S., Black women are nearly three times more likely to die during or after childbirth than their white counterparts,” she wrote in Elle.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Many of these deaths are considered by experts to be preventable. Being heard and appropriately treated was the difference between life or death for me; I know those statistics would be different if the medical establishment listened to every Black woman’s experience.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFighting for equal prize money for women&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn this Aug. 24, 2013, file photo, tennis players, from left, Serena Williams, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer cheer on the competition at the 18th Annual Arthur Ashe Kids' Day, the kick off to the 2013 US Open tennis tournament, on Saturday, in New York. (Photo by Charles Sykes/Invision/AP, File)\n\n\n\nWilliams has seen real change over the arc of her career.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe has strongly advocated that prize money for women should be the same as for men — a goal that was distant when she began as a pro.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEquity in tennis prize money has been improving — Wimbledon instituted equal prize money in 2007, a push that was, in large part, spearheaded by her sister Venus. By 2007, Serena Williams had already won the grass-court competition twice. The U.S. Open had instituted equal pay a generation before.  \n\n\n\nBut disparities remain outside of Grand Slam tournaments — and Williams’s focus is broader than tennis in any case. \n\n\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Glamour magazine, she was asked about the quest of the U.S. women’s soccer team for equal pay.  \n\n\n\n“These sports have a lot of work to do. And I really hope that I can be helpful in that journey because I do believe that women deserve the same pay,” Williams said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We work just as hard as men do. I've been working, playing tennis, since I was 3 years old. And to be paid less just because of my sex — it doesn't seem fair.” \n\n\n\nA New York Times story the same year reported that women playing professional tennis earned about 80 cents to every dollar their male counterparts were paid.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWilliams had already talked about the disparities back in 2012, in a post-match press conference at Wimbledon.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I deserve to get paid the same amount. I don't deserve less ‘cos I have boobs and they don't. That's definitely not the case. I worked just as hard since I was 3,” Williams said. “I definitely know my whole life has been dedicated toward being a top athlete, and I shouldn't get paid less because of my sex.”  \n\n\n\nCalling out double standards&nbsp;\n\n\n\n In this Sept. 8, 2018, file photo, Serena Williams argues with chair umpire Carlos Ramos during a match against Naomi Osaka, of Japan, in the women's final of the U.S. Open tennis tournament in New York. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File)\n\n\n\nWilliams’s cultural import can’t only be measured out in specific moments.  \n\n\n\nHer entire career has had a long-term impact on a whole host of complex topics, from body image to racial and gender stereotyping.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs her career has gone on, she has become more willing to frontally attack what she sees as double-standards or basic inequalities — including about her imminent retirement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the Vogue story where she announced her shift away from tennis — a shift motivated in part by a desire to have more children — she wrote:  “Believe me, I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don’t think it’s fair. If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family.”  \n\n\n\nOn the court, Williams has sometimes got into verbal altercations with umpires and line judges — episodes that she and her fans believe get undue attention and punishment because of her race and gender.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn March of this year, Williams noted that a male player, Alexander Zverev, had recently hit an umpire’s chair with his racket.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I would probably be in jail if I did that,” Williams told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. “Like, literally, no joke.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe returned to the subject of sexist double-standards just before the Open began, in a podcast interview with Meghan Markle.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"I have to win being Serena. And sometimes that’s more fierce,” she told Markle. “But is it fierce when guys are saying ‘come on’ and pumping their fists? It’s pretty exciting, but for me it’s ‘aggressive.’” \n\n\n\nIn that same interview, Williams offered a farewell of sorts as she prepared to bring down the curtain on her epic career.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I’m just from Compton. I never envisioned that this would be me, you know?,” she said. “I was just the youngest of five in a two-bedroom home.\"&nbsp;",

        "description": "Among the material allegedly seized from former President Trump’s home were numerous empty folders that once contained classified information or intel designated to be returned to the military, renewing questions over fallout from the potential mishandling of records and if they have since been recovered.\n\n\n\nIn an inventory from the Justice Department unsealed by a judge Friday, the government detailed that interspersed with Trump’s personal belongings were 48 empty folders with classified banners as well as another 42 empty folders that were labeled “return to staff secretary/military aide,” according to the filing.\n\n\n\nThe majority were found in Trump’s office, rather than the storage room at Mar-a-Lago.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s not clear if the materials the folders once housed are elsewhere in the boxes of recovered evidence, but experts say the suite of questions the detail raises argues in favor of allowing the Justice Department to continue its investigation, even as Trump seeks to stall its progress.\n\n\n\n“The ideal scenario that would describe this is that the empty folders are actually for the records that are somewhere else in the boxes — that someone just didn't keep them in the folder in the way they were supposed to, so they're not actually out there in the wild somewhere,” said Kel McClanahan, executive director of National Security Counselors, a nonprofit law firm specializing in national security law.\n\n\n\n“The least optimistic scenario is that they are nowhere to be found because they are already with someone else.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe inventory list was given to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon shortly before she heard arguments from Trump’s legal team asking to stall the FBI investigation so that a third-party special master could review the evidence to protect what they claim could be privileged material. The DOJ has argued such a move is unnecessary as its own team of staff not assigned to the case has already reviewed the evidence for privileged material.\n\n\n\nBeyond the empty folders, the Friday inventory details in broad strokes the other types of documents that were found within Trump's office among the tranche of more than 100 recovered classified records: three documents marked confidential, 17 documents marked secret and seven documents marked top-secret.\n\n\n\nLarry Pfeiffer, who previously served as senior director of the White House Situation Room and was chief of staff at the CIA, said the system for tracking classified documents should allow investigators to account for what information should be in the folders and determine if it is still on site.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut he expressed concern that the fact that they even ended up at Mar-a-Lago could mean proper record-keeping — even with career national security staffers on hand at the White House —&nbsp;may not have been taken seriously.\n\n\n\n“To me, it sounds like there was either a horrific systemic breakdown in those processes, No. 1., or those people just felt completely intimidated by Trump and the people around him. Or there were people who were completely operating around the system —&nbsp;that documents were flowing in and out of the Oval and up into the residence without ever going through this tracking process,” Pfeiffer told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think it's possible it was a mistake. I think it's possible they were folders that were holding the documents that were already found. But I worry it could have been folders that had other documents in them and now the mystery is where are the other documents? And that's the scary part.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat includes the materials that expressly directed they be returned to the military.\n\n\n\n“Anything that was in the folder should have been returned. The folder being there suggests it wasn’t,” Pfeiffer said.\n\n\n\nThe inventory list notes that the records were found mixed with clothes, books and other personal effects as well as some 10,000 presidential records that likely should be maintained by the National Archives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat they were kept with Trump’s belongings —&nbsp;and in some cases, in his office —&nbsp;could be an important detail for the DOJ, one they alluded to in their filing. The department noted that “all evidence — including the nature and manner in which they were stored” — will inform their investigation.\n\n\n\n“The co-mingling of all this stuff shows that there was no care taken with these records at a few different points in the process because at least one of two things happened to lead to this scenario,” McClanahan, the national security lawyer, said.\n\n\n\n“No 1., while he was in office he or his staff haphazardly mixed all this classified and unclassified material together in boxes, showing that they weren’t handling it properly in the office. Or two, after he got home, he started rooting through the boxes and putting things in and taking things out, which would show that there was clear awareness and involvement of the classified nature of this material. I think that it’s probably going to be a mix of the two,” he added.\n\n\n\nThe confusion around the documents also adds another dimension to the special master case. Cannon noted she would weigh whether to allow the intelligence community to continue its review of the potential national security implications tied to the mishandling of material, including how to protect sources and methods. The review is being led by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I don't think finding empty folders gives it any more urgency than it already deserves. The fact that some of the most sensitive documents in our government were sitting around in storage rooms at a golf resort in Florida, intermingled with a bunch of other stuff, that clearly people [without clearances] could have physical access to … is frightening,” Pfeiffer said.\n\n\n\n“The urgency is there regardless of whether there were empty folders found or not. And so therefore, having a special master now potentially put a halt to the damage assessment/risk assessment that the ODNI is doing, that would be further delay that we shouldn't have to put up with.”\n\n\n\nOthers warn there’s no good way to block the Justice Department’s work while allowing the intelligence community to conduct its own assessment about the potential fallout.\n\n\n\n\"The FBI's investigation and the Intelligence Community (IC) assessments are inextricably intertwined from a counterintelligence perspective,\" Brian Greer, a former CIA attorney, told The Hill by email.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"To assess the risks, it's important for the IC to know who accessed a given document, and they can only get that from the FBI.&nbsp;But if the court prohibits the FBI from accessing certain classified documents because they might be subject to an executive privilege claim, that process will break down.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCannon declined to make an immediate ruling on the matter when each side presented their arguments Thursday, but McClanahan said if she grants Trump’s request it could ultimately backfire for a former president who often insists he has been treated unfairly.\n\n\n\nHe noted a special master could easily decide the FBI did not obtain any materials that should be protected by either attorney-client or executive privileges, as Trump is asserting.\n\n\n\n“He won't be able to say, ‘the DOJ privilege review team wrongfully decided it,’ he's going to have to say, ‘the DOJ privilege review team, and the subject matter expert that I asked for, and a federal judge wrongfully decided it,’” McClanahan said.\n\n\n\n“And in an area like this where there's not a whole lot of room for him to be right — that’s a very risky move.”",

        "description": "Brad DeLong felt confident that the story started in 1870.The polymath economist was writing a book on economic modernity—about how humans transitioned from eking out an existence on our small planet to building a kind of utopia on it—and he saw an inflection point centuries after the emergence of capitalism and decades after the advent of manufacturing at scale. “The Industrial Revolution is good. The Industrial Revolution is huge,” he explained to me recently, sitting on the back porch of his wood-clad Colonial Revival in Berkeley, California. But “as of 1870, things have not really changed that much for most people.” Soon after that, though—after the development of the vertically integrated corporation, the industrial research lab, modern communication devices, and modular shipping technologies—“everything changes in a generation, and then changes again, and again, and again, and again.” Global growth increases fourfold. The world breaks out of near-universal agrarian poverty. Modernity takes hold.DeLong had begun working on this story in 1994. He had produced hundreds of thousands of words, then hundreds of thousands more, updating the text as academic economics and the world itself changed. He kept writing, for years, for decades, for so long that he ended up writing for roughly 5 percent of the time capitalism itself has existed. The problem wasn’t figuring out how the story started. The problem was knowing when it ended.In time, he decided that the era that had begun in 1870 ended in 2010, shortly after productivity growth and GDP growth had collapsed, as inequality was strangling economic vibrancy around the world and revanchist political populism was on the rise. With a bit more writing, he finished Slouching Towards Utopia, one of this year’s most anticipated economics books, to be published on Tuesday. His long-gestating examination of what he calls the “long 20th century” is sweeping and detailed, learned and accessible, familiar and strange—a definitive look at how we arrived at such material splendor and how it failed to deliver all that it seemed to promise. His decision to end the story in 2010, and thus to finish his book, holds a message for all of us: Despite its problems and iniquities, the economic era Americans just lived through was miraculous. And now it is over.[Derek Thompson: Is this a recession? Wrong question.]As for the story of DeLong himself: He is an economic historian and a macroeconomist at UC Berkeley, a liberal policy stalwart, and one of the original econ bloggers, still publishing his thoughts almost daily, as he has done since before the word blog was invented in 1999. His story, I suppose, really begins in Washington, D.C., where he grew up as the science-fiction-obsessed, math-whiz son of a lawyer and a clinical psychologist. (His mother still sees patients.) He went to Harvard for an undergraduate degree and then a Ph.D. in economics, writing papers and forging close friendships with a teenage Soviet refugee named Andre Shleifer (now the second-most-cited economist on Earth) and Larry Summers (the former Treasury secretary and Harvard president). “Brad is the person you want to write with if you want a collaborator doing something that’s bold, potentially important, possibly wrong, and unlikely to satisfy pedantic academic referees,” Summers told me. “I’m a huge, huge fan of the guy.”Along with his academic work, DeLong served in the Clinton administration. He married the legal scholar Ann Marie Marciarille, an expert on health-care regulation; they had two kids, now adults. And he started blogging—the thing for which he is perhaps best known. Since 1999, he has written in his “semi-daily journal,” which is funny, erudite, and weird. (Over the years, he has flambéed no fewer than 11 people as the “stupidest man alive,” among them former World Bank President Bob Zoellick.)DeLong’s book project preceded the blog. In 1994, he read the socialist historian Eric Hobsbawm’s The Age of Extremes, on the “short 20th century” between the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, in 1914, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, in 1991. “It makes a grand narrative arc, with communism as the tragic hero of the 20th century, hopelessly marred by the circumstances of its birth,” DeLong told me. He loved it, and decided to cast his own long arc, with capitalism as the tragic hero.The heroic part is heroic: For the first time in history, DeLong notes, the world managed to create enough after 1870. Enough to end subsistence agriculture in much of the world. Enough to reduce the global child-mortality rate from nearly 50 percent to less than 5 percent. Enough that many of the very poorest people on Earth have access to cellphones and electricity today. But the tragic part is tragic: This modern era also brought with it machine guns and atom bombs and the atrocities of the Holocaust, among other genocides. And even as so many economies succeeded, so many governments failed—to end racial injustice, to protect the most vulnerable, to ensure that everybody shared in the world’s prosperity, to conserve our common environment.[From the December 2020 issue: The next decade could be even worse]In his basement, his attic, and his office, DeLong kept assembling his book. He used the free-marketeer Friedrich Hayek and the social-protectionist Karl Polanyi as central figures and then braided in details about a huge cast of characters: Marx; Henry Ford; Keynes; Hitler; Gandhi; his own great-great-uncle, an economic historian named Abbott Payson Usher.His editors kept checking in. His friends inquired about the drafts they had read years before. The project ballooned in its complexity. “I have had editors who were saying [they were] going to drop me if I couldn’t get it down to 150,000 words,” DeLong told me. (The book ended up at 180,000, plus online notes and appendices.) But he kept learning new things. “I can start reading a book, and then from it I can spin up in my brain a sub-Turing instantiation of the author’s mind, which I then run on my wetware,” he told me. “I can ask it questions, and it answers.” Describing his own thought process, he added: “‘A rich inner life’ is one way to put it. Or perhaps a slight absence of grip on what is the real world and what is not.”In 1999, he thought the book could end by discussing what Francis Fukuyama called “the end of history”—the idea, popularized in a book of the same name, that the fall of communism heralded the final triumph of democracy and free-market neoliberal economics. “There were these huge ideological struggles, but now we’ve kind of got it,” DeLong said, describing his mindset at the turn of the millennium. “There’s going to be some future alternation between right neoliberalism, left neoliberalism, and social democracy.” But then came 9/11 and the global War on Terror. “People seemed to be about to start killing each other in large numbers about religion,” DeLong said. Moreover, he added, “most of what we Clintonites had actually managed to do in terms of whacking economic policy into what we saw as a good state was to enable another round of tax cuts for the rich and another round of plutocracy.” And then came President Barack Obama and the “enormous failure to actually implement what I had thought was the standard playbook we’d learned in the Great Depression,” DeLong said.In time, DeLong concluded that neoliberalism and social democracy would not be gently taking turns. In political terms, the future instead would be about the “return of something that Madeleine Albright called fascism, and who am I to tell her not to,” he said. And in economic terms, it would be about high inequality, low productivity, and slow growth. “We may have solved the problem of production,” DeLong told me. “We certainly have not solved the problem of distribution, or of utilizing our extraordinary, immense wealth to make us happy and good people.”[From the January/February 2005 issue: Shaken and stirred]The story the book tells is compelling, though occasionally overpowering in its detail and telescoped in its argument. The global South—where the majority of humanity lives—gets cursory treatment. DeLong argues that fitting much of its economic history into his book would have been too complicated. And while gesturing to the evidence that colonial empires leeched prosperity from conquered land, he asserts that the North “causally led” the “advances” of the South. Yet the book is justice-minded and tenderhearted too. “There’s someone in Bangladesh who would almost surely be a better economics professor than I am and is now behind a water buffalo,” he told me. “The market economy gives me and my preferences 200 times the voice and weight of his. If that isn’t the biggest market failure of all, I don’t know what your definition of market failure could possibly be.”For all its problems, the long 20th century granted enormous prosperity to billions of people: cellphones, white-collar jobs, the birth-control pill, penicillin, space exploration, home appliances, electric grids, the internet. If, as DeLong claims, a remarkable period of prosperity has ended, then governments face the enormous task of strengthening representative democracy, reallocating the world’s immense resources more equitably, and reigniting productivity growth. As for DeLong, he has a more immediate challenge: figuring out what to do with the hundreds of thousands of words he trimmed out of Slouching Towards Utopia. He thinks he might write a history of the economy, full stop. That story might start in 6,000 B.C.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3624462-we-need-better-unions/",
        "description": "Workers have been trying to unionize Starbucks, Amazon, news groups and automakers, sometimes successfully. This has caused commenters to wonder — again — whether this means unions in America are back.  \n\n\n\nThey aren’t. They won’t be until they drop their ideological shtick that has hurt their prospects for decades.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe unions that exist right now are built around hostile relationships with companies, and are uninterested in finding “win-win” situations that protect workers by adding value to companies. We need better unions. But we’ll have to change unionization laws for them to have a chance to emerge.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe current approach to unionization relies too heavily upon a victim narrative. Under this view, those who are not in a union are at risk of oppression by employers, and only collective bargaining can even the scales.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese assumptions underlie current union practices. Managers empowered to reward performance might abuse that power through favoritism, so all wages must follow single salary schedules based on seniority rather than performance. The precise length of breaks, and their frequency, must be spelled out in detail. Leave time is categorized and classified, with fixed accrual rates and maximums based on seniority. Where applicable, collective bargaining agreements often specify the type and number of uniforms to be provided to employees, as though an employer would not otherwise provide them.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese practices are not in response to management problems in union shops. They are instead based on union leaders’ assumptions that managers are abusers who can only be cowed with precise bureaucracy. In that kind of oppressive world, only the union can be trusted.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTheir assumptions bleed into union politics. To union leaders, there’s a corporate bogeyman behind every policy and every problem — and only the union can combat them to ensure that the working man gets a fair shake.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe fact that typical household income continues to increase as unionization rates fall is a demonstration that the world is more complicated than the oppressive union economic model.  \n\n\n\nThis isn’t because the concept of unionization is unpopular — far from it. Unionization as a concept remains broadly popular, including across party lines. The problem is simpler: Unions continue to operate based on a decades-old approach to labor relations. That might be the kind of rhetoric that works when labor is cheap and people don’t have many options outside of the big industry in town. But it doesn’t fit in today’s economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnions continue to operate in an outdated model of hostility between workers and management. And they continue to bleed members as a result.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf unions wish to reverse the trend of declining membership, they need to fundamentally reorient their approach to labor relations. Either that, or new unions need to spring up without the ideological baggage of existing labor groups.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey need to leave behind the model where they treat all members as oppressed cogs and move to a model where they provide valuable services to their members and find ways to make union membership valuable for companies. It would be better to shift to an approach where unions serve as professional organizations, advocating for their members’ interests and providing tools for members to collaborate. Unions could train their members, award voluntary certifications, offer insurance, and provide assistance to employees negotiating their own terms and conditions of employment. In short, unions need to step forward into the 21st century.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCongress should revise the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to allow for workers and unions to work with managers, without the assumption that the relationship will be adversarial. This includes amending the NLRA to eliminate the requirement that employers be forced to bargain against their will, while at the same time allowing multiple unions to serve the needs of employees within the same bargaining unit.  \n\n\n\nThese steps would create the legal framework necessary for unions to step forward into a modern approach to labor relations. But unions also would need to forgo their traditional approach of negotiating on behalf of all employees, instead choosing to negotiate only on behalf of their members. Unions then would need to demonstrate why membership is beneficial by providing value that workers consider worth their dues, rather than forcibly representing those workers. The end result would be more competition, better representation, and increased worker freedom.  \n\n\n\nUnions leaders must drop their assumptions that everyone is out to get their members. And if they do, labor law can change in a way that supports voluntary, mutually beneficial association. But until they drop their ideology, union activists shouldn’t expect things to change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJames M. Hohman is the director of fiscal policy at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, where Steve Delie is the director of labor policy.  ",

        "description": "Photo credit should read RHONA WISE/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n  A Marlins memory from this day in 1997. For the Florida Marlins, the 1997 season was full of thrilling finishes and late-game drama. \nThe Marlins ultimately topped the American League champion Cleveland Indians in walk-off fashion to win Game 7 of the 1997 World Series. On this day 25 years ago, the Marlins completed the three-game sweep of the American League team that finished with the best record in walk-off fashion. \nAfter rallying from three runs down, Gary Sheffield’s ninth-inning blast lifted Florida to a 7-6 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. The Marlins opened the series with a 10-4 victory before knocking the Orioles on a walk-off single from Edgar Renteria in the 10th inning to take the second game of the series. They arrived at Pro Player Stadium on Sept. 3, 1997, looking for the sweep. \nJay Powell worked a perfect top of the ninth to get the Marlins to the bottom of the inning tied at 6-6 in the series finale. Looking to force extra innings, the Orioles turned to right-hander Shawn Boskie. \nBoskie opened the inning by getting Edgar Renteria to ground out. Things looked good as Boskie was able to get ahead of Sheffield in the count, 1-2. \nHis next pitch got too much of the plate. \nOn a fastball from Boskie, Sheffield hammered it well over the tall scoreboard in left field for a no-doubt walk-off home run. The blast gave Florida its sixth straight win and eighth in nine games as the Marlins were a season-high 28 games over .500 at 83-55. \n\n\nThe Marlins started strong with two runs in the first inning on RBI singles from Bobby Bonilla and Darren Daulton. The Orioles finally got the bats going with three runs in the fourth and three more in the fifth. \nIn the fourth, Mike Bordick’s two-run single was followed by an RBI single from Jeffrey Hammonds. After the Marlins drew even on an RBI single from Devon White in the bottom of the fourth, Baltimore answered with a three-run home run from Cal Ripken Jr. in the fifth. \nDown 6-3, the Marlins drew even with three runs in the sixth. Craig Counsell tripled home two before scoring the tying run on a single from Jim Eisenreich. The bullpens traded zeroes in the seventh and eighth innings. \nSheffield finished with three hits while White, Daulton and Counsell each had two in the victory. Aaron Ledesma had two hits for Baltimore in the loss. \nFor Sheffield, the 1997 season would be a largely disappointing one. After hitting .314 with 42 home runs and 120 RBIs in 1996, Sheffield hit just .250 with 21 homers and 71 RBIs in 1997. His only walk-off blast that season—and the first of his career—came on this day a quarter-century ago.",

        "description": "The Savage Garden singer on his violent father, embracing his sexuality and performing with PavarottiSinger-songwriter Darren Hayes was born in Brisbane in 1972. His journey to stardom began in 1993, when Hayes responded to an advertisement in a newspaper written by Daniel Jones, a local musician searching for a vocalist to front his covers band, Red Edge. Hayes and Jones would go on to form the duo Savage Garden, releasing only two albums but selling more than 25m records globally and creating some of the definitive ballads of the 90s: Truly Madly Deeply, To the Moon and Back and I Knew I Loved You. Hayes went on to forge a successful solo career, and his new album, Homosexual, is out on 7 October. He tours his greatest hits in March 2023.This photo isn’t what it appears to be. It looks like a sweet setup of a 12-year-old boy smiling in his bedroom with the world on his lap and a poster of his favourite artist behind him. What you can’t see are the other rooms in that house, with holes in the walls patched up with putty. Or how unhappy I was, with a violent alcoholic father who would physically abuse my mother.

The motor-mouthed crooks up on the screen were shooting the breeze; their conversation turned to Black female action stars of the 1970s. And suddenly there it was: the name “Pam Grier”, uttered admiringly by Tim Roth and Chris Penn.“My friends were all standing up and screaming right there in the theatre,” she recalls.

        "description": "Call Me By Your name director Luca Guadagnino serves up some fine young cannibals, Cate Blanchett dazzles in a musical tour de force, and Call My Agent!’s Laure Calamy is full of surprisesVenice has a reputation as the easy A-list festival – the one that comes as a gentle package of calm and Campari by contrast with the agitation of Cannes. Well, the calm may yet settle upon us, but it’ll take a day or two for the stress to wear off. During the lockdown years, Venice managed to subsist in very sturdy form by introducing a ticketing system partly designed to maintain social distancing and it pretty much worked fine. Last Sunday morning, though, a new online ticket system raised public and press hackles by putting delegates through a baffling e-labyrinth of queues and dead ends for more than five hours. Once people actually arrived in the city, greeted by a Wednesday morning downpour, followed by a blast of blistering sun, we all felt we’d been put through a special circle of Dante’s hell reserved for jaded cinephiles.Just as well, then, that the festival got off to a juicy start. It kicked off with writer-director Noah Baumbach, whose Marriage Story was one of Venice’s most popular hits in recent years. His competition opener, White Noise, however, isn’t nearly as gratifying. Adapted from Don DeLillo’s 1985 novel, it’s set in a fictional university town. Adam Driver plays a lecturer in Hitler studies who takes shelter with his wife (Greta Gerwig) and kids after a chemical calamity sends their community into a chaotic evacuation. Don Cheadle plays a fellow academic, the resident dispenser of enigmatic cultural aperçus and a specialist in the meaning of the great American car crash. This is a wordy, enigmatic and visually stylised number, with Driver delivering his non-sequitur one-liners with wry aplomb, and there’s a definite tang of Robert Altman to the frenetic stylisation, but it’s never entirely clear quite what the film is for. It’s pitched as a period piece, a post-postmodernist take on the glacial irony of DeLillo’s style, but its manic ironies are an awkward translation of the chilly detachment of the original. Still, if you’re of the 1980s generation that looked to Devo videos for philosophical statements on consumerist alienation, you may get a nostalgic frisson. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Boston’s H+H shine in a live recording of Haydn’s Theresienmesse; and WNO, Stephen McNeff and Gruff Rhys do Hedd Wyn proud• The Gloria from Haydn’s Theresienmesse (Mass in B flat, Hob XXII:12, 1799), with its exuberant choral writing, rushing string figures, trumpets and drums, is music to raise any spirits, is just one of the splendours of this expressive work. A new recording from the Handel and Haydn Society, conducted by Harry Christophers (Coro), with soloists Mary Bevan (soprano), Catherine Wyn-Rogers (mezzo-soprano), Jeremy Budd (tenor) and Sumner Thompson (baritone), has all the vigour and risk you need from a live recording. Based in Boston, Massachusetts, “H+H”, now associated with historically informed performances, was founded in 1815 as an oratorio society and gave the US premieres of major choral works such as Handel’s Messiah and Haydn’s The Creation.As artistic director since 2008 and now conductor laureate, Harry Christophers – best known as director of his elite British choral group the Sixteen – has made more than a dozen albums with H+H. The other work here is Haydn’s London Symphony, No 103 “Drum Roll”, its second-movement double variations and horn-calls finale a display of the composer’s ingenuity, played with wit and grace.

Some offensive support would have been nice. Better selection might help that. Cubs were swinging pretty wildly, especially in the seventh when they had a good chance to score. Might have helped, since Sean Newcomb was coming in, and he has a propensity for adding to the score.

        "description": "“Donald Trump’s political advisers are in early discussions with Republican campaigns about actively deploying him on the trail this fall, with party strategists placing a risky bet that Trump can boost GOP turnout without repelling moderates and independents who do not support the former president,” the Washington Post reports.\n\n\n\n“Trump plans to be more engaged in October than in September, by appearing at rallies, in robocalls and potentially on tele-town halls and at fundraisers, according to a close adviser, who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential strategy. Trump’s political team has told others they want to be cooperative and helpful, focusing Trump on rural areas where he has strong support. Talks have included states across the South and Upper Midwest, among others.”\n\n\n\n“But the risk is acute that his presence could distract from what the GOP has sought to make its central message of the midterms: that voters should fire Democrats who have presided over rising costs and violent crime.”",

        "description": "Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Colorado Rockies news and links for Saturday, September 3, 2022 History is always made up of two sides to the same story. For every feat that has been accomplished, there is always some poor, unfortunate soul that was a key contributor to that notable feat. Among the many unfortunate things that have happened to the Colorado Rockies in 2022, a strange occurrence that I’m sure many folks have noticed is the number of notable achievements, milestones, and historical feats that seem to always pop up against the team. This article isn’t meant to bash the Rockies, but rather to highlight some of the strange, unfortunate coincidences that just so happen to involve the Rockies' contributions. \nIsildur’s Heir \nThis article’s topic was sparked by the dominant pitching clinic put on by Atlanta Braves rookie pitcher Spencer Strider last Thursday when the Rockies struck out 16 times against the young righty in eight innings of work. He allowed just two hits and didn’t walk anyone as he continued to bamboozle Rockies hitters with a simple two-pitch mix of a high-octane fastball and devastating slider. \nWhen you think of the rich history of Braves pitching, especially in the 1990s, it felt like a surprise that Strider set a new franchise record for most strikeouts in a regular nine-inning affair, surpassing Hall of Famer John Smoltz who reached the 15 punchout mark twice in his career, most recently in 2005. It was also the fourth time in Rockies history that they have struck out at least 16 times against a single pitcher in a game. Strikeouts are a huge part of baseball now, and the Rockies' unfortunate hitting trends this season haven’t been kind to them. But hey, at least they haven’t been victim to a no-hitter this season! \nMr. 3,000\nThe Rockies playing the Tigers in Detroit early in the season feels like it happened years ago. However, the record books do show that the team did play there in April and all eyes were on Miguel Cabrera as he was just a few hits away from 3,000. Miggy needed just one hit when he stepped up to the plate for the first time in game one of the double-header that day, and he got it done right away against Antonio Senzatela with a single. \nI wrote about the Rockies' contributions to the 3,000-hit club following that game, since it wasn’t the first time such an occurrence had come about. Four of the last nine batters to reach the milestone have done so against Colorado and while it’s a great milestone to celebrate, I’d be okay if the Rockies never give up the 3,000th hit to anyone ever again. \nOld Dogs\nAlbert Pujols, in his pursuit of 700 home runs, has been one of the hottest hitters in the month of August. Oddly enough, as a player over the age of 40, there is still room for first-time feats in a long, storied career. While playing in a forgettable series in St. Louis on August 18, and the game already getting out of hand, Pujols was called upon to pinch-hit with the bases loaded. He proceeded to belt career homer 690, his 16th career grand slam, and oddly enough it was the first time he had ever hit a pinch-hit grand slam. \nThat’s not all, because Adam Wainwright also helped send them both into the record books. Wainwright fired seven shutout innings against the Rockies, making it the first time in MLB history that a 40-year-old player hit a grand slam and a 40-year-old pitcher threw at least seven scoreless innings for the same team in the same game according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The fact that in over 150 years of MLB history that something like that has never happened is one of the wonderful things about baseball stats and at least the Rockies had the chance to be a part of that, even if they did lose in a blowout. \nYoung Blue Blood\nIt wouldn’t an article about being on the wrong side of history if we didn’t mention the Los Angeles Dodgers. It seems like the Dodgers have an endless stream of players, especially rookies, just eager to make a splash against the Rockies. James Outman was the latest benefactor after he had a historic performance in Dodgers history when he made his debut at the end of July this season. \nIn his first at-bat in the big leagues, Outman connected for a two-run homer on the third pitch he saw in the third inning. He followed up with a single and a double later in the game, becoming the first Dodger in franchise history to log three hits (including a home run), total three RBI, and score two runs in his MLB debut. He was also the first MLB player in seven years to tally three hits, one home run, and three RBI in a debut since Joey Gallo did so in 2015. \nA Monster Shot\nThe last one I wanted to highlight is a home run that was given up at the end of May this season when the Rockies faced off against the Miami Marlins at Coors Field. In the second inning, Jesús Sánchez clobbered a slider from Ryan Feltner halfway up the third and upper deck for a 496-foot shot. \nThe home run was the longest home run ever hit at Coors Field by a left-handed hitter, and the second longest by any hitter, trailing only Giancarlo Stanton’s 504-foot shot in 2016. You can’t help but stare in awe when a ball is crushed like that and it makes you hope the Rockies can develop some more hitters that aim to crush those records and take their rightful place as the owners of those feats. \nLife is Funny that Way\nThe Rockies being on the wrong side of history is not an exclusive thing. Over the course of 150 years of MLB history, it’s happened to everyone. Sure, it’s unfortunate that the Rockies have been subject to playing a part in a number of things, especially this season, but looking at it through the lens of witnessing history is a way to make peace with it. Baseball is unpredictable and you never know what exactly you’re going to see, so come what may and love it, because either way, the Rockies can be an answer during trivia night. \n★ ★ ★\nA healthy Kris Bryant won’t solve the Rockies’ problems: Analysis | The Denver Gazette ($)\nDanielle Allentuck breaks down a track record of the Colorado Rockies based on a question asked to Bud Black in which he responded that the Rockies are contenders with a healthy Kris Bryant. She goes position by position and points out that there are plenty more problems with the team that a single free agent signing isn’t going to fix. \nInjuries &amp; Moves: Daza goes 3-for-4 in rehab | MLB.com\nTime is running out for Kris Bryant to come back at all this season, but with no timetable for a return. It’s likely the Rockies will just cut their losses and let the kids keep on playing. Sean Bouchard and Michael Toglia are getting some quality time, and it’s for the best that they get as much time as they can with them. \n★ ★ ★\nOn The Farm\nTriple-A: Sugar Land Space Cowboys 9, Albuquerque Isotopes 2\nThe Isotopes struggled to get their offense going after scoring in the first two innings, as they struck out 16 times in their loss to Sugar Land. In his second rehab start, Yonathan Daza went 0-for-4 with three punchouts. Wynton Bernard continued his strong minor league season with a two-hit evening while Sam Hilliard hit his fifth homer in Triple-A. Coco Montes also provided the pop with his 19th homer of the season, showing that he is worthy of a call-up at some point. Karl Kauffman went five innings, but a five-run bottom of the first hurt him as he ended up allowing seven runs on nine hits. Nick Kennedy allowed runs in 2⁄3 of an inning before giving way to Ashton Goudeau who threw 2 1⁄3 perfect innings. \nDouble-A: Reading Fightin Phils 11, Hartford Yard Goats 2 \nIt was a tough night for Hartford, despite totaling seven hits, including Brenton Doyle’s 19th homer of the season, and a pair of doubles from Hunter Stovall and Daniel Montano, they managed just two runs as they struck out 14 times. Noah Gotsis started on the hill for the Yard Goats and labored through 3 2⁄3  innings, allowing eight runs on eight hits with three strikeouts and three walks. Boby Johnson struggled in relief after allowing three more runs on two hits before he registered one out to end the fourth inning. A highlight pitching-wise come from Garrett Schilling who tossed three scoreless innings and struck out five along with Dugan Darnell who also threw two scoreless innings and struck out five. Both pitchers allowed just one hit each. \nHigh-A: Vancouver Canadians 7, Spokane Indians 5\nThree runs, courtesy of two home runs, in the bottom of the ninth, weren’t enough for Spokane as their rally fell short on Friday night. Colin Simpson led the way with three hits on the night including a solo shot in the bottom of the ninth, while Hunter Goodman hit his 12th homer in Spokane in the third inning. Andrew Quezada started on the mound and gave up three runs on five hits in five innings of work which tagged him with the loss. Will Tribucher had a rough night, allowing four runs on four hits in 1 1⁄3 innings of work. \nLow-A: Fresno Grizzlies 11, Modesto Nuts 6\nBenny Montgomery came a home run shy of the cycle as the Fresno Grizzlies took down the Modesto Nuts. Montgomery led the way with his three hits while driving in two runs, along with Jordan Beck who went 1-for-2 with his first Fresno long ball and two RBI while also drawing three walks. EJ Andrews Jr. also had a strong night, driving in four runs during a two-hit night. Victor Juarez made the start for Fresno and took home the win, allowing four runs on five hits in 5 2⁄3 innings. \n★ ★ ★\nPlease keep in mind our Purple Row Community Guidelines when you’re commenting.

Elsewhere, the Tangram collective explore deep listening and silence…Swathed in enough gold lamé to lighten anyone’s darkness, the star American mezzo-soprano Jamie Barton turns out to be the kind of supernatural being a newly dead soul might hope to meet as they enter purgatory. This place of expiation features heavily in Elgar’s The Dream of Gerontius (1900), settings of texts by Cardinal John Henry Newman, which was given a properly out-of-this-world performance at the Proms on Wednesday. The massed forces of Manchester’s Hallé Choir and the London Philharmonic Choir, with the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Edward Gardner, had perfected every awkward detail of this long, exacting work. The British tenor Allan Clayton sang Gerontius, the dying man of the title who finds eternity. British bass James Platt was Priest/Angel of the Agony, comforter and inspiration. Barton sang the Angel.First performed in Birmingham town hall, Gerontius has always provoked extreme reactions, initially to its Roman Catholicism in a mostly Anglican country, now because its religiosity, with all the resonance of that word, is too much for some. The work falls into two uneven halves, the first a deathbed scene, the second a world of angels and mawkish demons. By resisting exaggeration or rhetoric, Gardner and his forces untied Elgar’s ambitious soundscape and made a consoling, exciting unity. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Double L.  The Pittsburgh Pirates took two Ls on Friday, when they dropped a 4-0 decision to the Toronto Blue Jays in Johan Oviedo’s first start as a Pirate and also lost Ke’Bryan Hayes to a shoulder injury. \nOviedo went three scoreless innings, racking up four strikeouts while also giving up two hits and three walks. But he threw 80 pitches in just those three innings, with a plethora of foul balls leading to some very long at bats. \nBut in typical Bucco fashion, there was no run support, with the team only snagging five total hits on the day. Welcome to Pittsburgh, Johan, where even pitching shutout ball won’t get you on the winning side a lot of the time. \nOnly three Pittsburgh batters got hits on the day, with Jack Suwisnki going 2-for-4 and Tyler Heineman going 2-for-3. Cal Mitchell was 1-for-2 for the other Bucco hit. \nBut Pittsburgh didn’t just lose the game, they also lost third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes to a shoulder injury when he tried to dive for a ball in the fourth inning. Manager Derek Shelton said Hayes was experiencing some discomfort and he “just didn’t look right” and is officially listed as day-to-day. Though with the season sinking fast, there’s certainly no reason to rush Hayes back. \nTyler Beede ended up with the loss for the Bucs, as he gave up an RBI double to Santiago Espinal in the fourth, finishing with a line of three innings pitched, giving up two runs on five hits with one walk and one strikeout. Over his last seven appearances, he’s now 0-4 with a 7.71 ERA. \nThe Jays padded their lead in the ninth with a two-run dinger by Bo Bichette off of Yohan Ramirez, but with Pittsburgh’s bats unable to do much of anything, it was academic at that point anyway. \nThe Bucs will try to score a run again tonight at 6:35pm.",

        "description": "Photo by Harry How/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Dodgers got reasonably good news from Tony Gonsolin’s MRI exam Friday, with the right-hander cleared to resume a throwing program after getting shut down for a few days.\n\n\n#Dodgers MGR Dave Roberts said MRI on Tony Gonsolin “was about as good as we could have expected” and that the RHP will resume playing catch today.— Mike DiGiovanna (@MikeDiGiovanna) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nGonsolin was placed on the injured list Monday with right forearm inflammation. The earliest he could return, if all goes well, is September 15.\nGavin Lux was scratched from Friday’s lineup with a flare up of the neck issue that’s limited him to just four starts over the last 10 games. Dave Roberts said Lux is expected to be out of the lineup Saturday as well, and will be reevaluated Sunday, per Sarah Wexler of MLB.com.  \nAfter starting the first 130 games of the season, Trea Turner was out of the lineup on Friday, getting a rare game of rest. J.P. Hoornstra at the Orange County Register has more.\nTrayce Thompson began turning to former Cleveland All-Star Grady Sizemore — his favorite player as a teen — for advice in 2021, and the two have broken down film occasionally and still keep in touch regularly. Stephanie Apstein at Sports Illustrated has more on Thompson’s resurgence with the Dodgers.\nAndy McCullough at The Athletic on the Dodgers: “To argue that this team is anything other than baseball’s best is to waste breath and brain cells. They achieved this through Friedman’s blending of superstars with a revolving door of useful depth. How much that will mean come October is a more interesting question.”\nJay Jaffe at FanGraphs wrote about the Dodgers trying to navigate preparing for October while also not losing focus in September, and working their way through pitching injuries that test their vaunted depth.\nBen Clemens at FanGraphs found that sweeping sliders — like the kind Evan Phillips throws — by right-handed pitchers against right-handed batters produce a lower batting average on balls in play and higher popup rate than non-sweeping sliders. On the latter, Clemens wrote, “Want some outs on balls in play? Get them in the air at a lazy angle. It’s not rocket science, though Los Angeles probably employs plenty of rocket scientists.”\nThe Justin Turner Foundation’s annual Turner Trot 5K run/walk is this Sunday morning, starting at Dodger Stadium.",

        "description": "Enlarge / The now-extinct Haast’s eagle hunting moa in New Zealand, which lacked other large predators. Today scientists are looking at the ancient history of the islands’ birds to better understand how “natural” biological invasions happen. (credit: John Megahan/CC)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Zealand has long been known as a place for the birds—quite literally. Before people arrived 700 years ago, the archipelago hosted an idiosyncratic ecosystem, nearly free of mammals. More than 200 bird species filled a food web all their own. Rather than cows or antelopes, there was a family of flightless birds known as moa. And in place of apex predators like tigers, New Zealand had Haast’s eagle.\nEver since a group of farm workers drained a swamp in the late 1860s and uncovered its buried bones, this eagle has captivated researchers. Julius Haast, the explorer and geologist who published the first notes on the species, described it as “a raptorial bird of enormous dimensions.” Today, biologists estimate that the eagles weighed up to 33 pounds—roughly 50 percent more than any raptor known today. But with a wingspan of only two to three meters—just beyond the range of a bald eagle—this was an oddly proportioned bird.\nThe shape of Haast’s eagle was one of many puzzles that scientists faced as they studied this long-extinct species, preserved in just a few skeletons, plus scattered bits and pieces. For nearly a century, there was a debate over whether such a large bird could fly; even after that feud was settled, questions remained about whether the bird was capable of killing moa, which in some cases would have been more than 15 times larger than the eagle itself. Now, new scientific techniques, combined with a clearer understanding of New Zealand’s geological history, has placed the Haast’s eagle amid a much larger ecological discussion: how species comes to “invade” new territories.Read 24 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

This week, New York University researchers for the Center for Social Media and Politics showed results from a YouTube experiment that just happened to be conducted right when election fraud claims were raised in fall 2020. They say their results provide an important caveat to prior research by showing evidence that in 2020, YouTube's algorithm was responsible for \"disproportionately\" recommending election fraud content to users more \"skeptical of the election's legitimacy to begin with.\"\nA coauthor of the study, Vanderbilt University political scientist James Bisbee told The Verge that even though participants were recommended a low number of election denial videos—a maximum of 12 videos out of hundreds participants clicked on—the algorithm generated three times as many to people predisposed to buy into the conspiracy than it to people who did not. \"The more susceptible you are to these types of narratives about the election... the more you would be recommended content about that narrative,\" Bisbee said.\nYouTube spokesperson Elena Hernandez told Ars that Bisbee's team's report \"doesn't accurately represent how our systems work.\" Hernandez says, \"YouTube doesn't allow or recommend videos that advance false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurred in the 2020 US presidential election\" and YouTube's \"most viewed and recommended videos and channels related to elections are from authoritative sources, like news channels.\"Read 20 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

(credit: LG)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you've been watching display tech lately, you may have noticed an interesting feature: bendable displays. Yes, monitors and TVs that you can bend to be either flat or curved are purportedly coming out soon. The feature is meant to appease those who can't settle on flat or curved, and most upcoming products feel similarly indecisive, exhibiting identity crises that make it hard to see where they fit... literally. Does something like this belong in a living room, office, or gaming den?\nIn the case of the LG OLED Flex LX3 4K TV announced Wednesday (no price or release date), the most obvious answer is the living room. It's a 42-inch TV with a tuner, LG's webOS, and even LG Display's OLED Evo technology used in the LG C2 TV. The primary difference from every other TV is that this one has buttons (including buttons on the remote) for changing the screen from flat to a 900R curvature across 20 steps. That provides the potential for an extremely curved TV.\nThe thing is, you probably don't want to watch curved television. Vendors tried making this a thing years ago, but as we wrote back then, curved TVs mostly accommodate people sitting pretty close to and directly in front of the TV. That's not how most people gather 'round the heart of the living room. Living room TVs are frequently shared, with people sitting at various distances from the screen and at varying angles. But up close and centered sounds awfully similar to how most people use monitors.Read 8 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

The cost is the energy and new materials mined from the earth for new phones, and unrecycled materials sitting in homes. Extending the lives of smartphones by five years—from their current typical two- to three-year lives—would be like taking 5 million cars off the road, according to the Commission's findings.\nThe most notable proposed fix (listed in Annex II) is for phone makers and sellers to make \"professional repairers\" available for five years after the date a phone is removed from the market. Those repairers would have access to parts including the battery, display, cameras, charging ports, mechanical buttons, microphones, speakers, and hinge assemblies (including for folding phones and tablets).Read 9 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

Drake made a number of contributions to radio astronomy, including serving as director of the Arecibo radio telescope facility. But Drake is probably best known for an equation that bears his name and his subsequent involvement in SETI efforts. His equation was the first significant attempt to estimate the probability of intelligent extraterrestrial life.\nDrake did his PhD in radio astronomy, and his academic career continued with astronomy as a focus. That eventually brought him to the Arecibo observatory. Drake was involved in the observatory's conversion from a military research site to a civilian, science-focused facility, and he later became its director.\nBut Drake always had a side hustle: the attempt to find other intelligent life in the Universe. His most prominent contribution in this area was the formulation of what's now known as the Drake equation. It's purportedly a calculation—plug in the probabilities of a handful of things like the frequency of exoplanets around stars and the probability of life forming spontaneously, and out would pop the overall number of intelligent civilizations in our galaxy.Read 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

It's part of a mutually beneficial arrangement, since the bacteria protect vulnerable larvae and pupae from fungi. Scientists have also determined that only adult females retain these symbiotic bacteria, shuffling the populations out of those back pockets via friction to the genital area as they emerge from their pupae, according to a new paper published in the journal Frontiers in Physiology.\n“We show how an insect can maintain beneficial microbial partners despite the drastic rearrangements of body structures that occur during metamorphosis,” said co-author Laura V. Flórez of the University of Copenhagen. “By modifying unique ‘pockets’ on their backs, Lagria beetles manage to keep their protective symbionts and facilitate their relocation during pupation to newly developed adult organs.”\nThere are many examples of microbial symbionts in nature. For instance, the Hawaiian bobtail squid has a built-in flashlight to help the creature navigate those murky nighttime waters, hunt for prey, and hide from predators in turn. It's a special organ on the underside, a convenient little cavity that houses colonies of bacteria, Vibrio fischeri. Once that bacterial colony reaches a critical threshold, they all begin to glow, serving as a light source for the squid. Aphids, tubeworms, digger wasps, cereal weevils, and bean bugs have also evolved symbiotic relationships with microbes for various purposes.Read 8 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

[credit:\n                        BradleyWarrenPhotography                        ]\n                  \n        \n      \n      \n  \nWhen Fiat Chrysler America merged with Peugeot, part of the reason was the former's challenges in getting an electric vehicle to market in the US. By the time the merger was finally consummated in early 2021, the plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica minivan was the only electrified vehicle in the US portfolio of Stellantis. Since then, we've seen the launch of two new PHEVs from the company's top US-selling Jeep brand: the Jeep Wrangler 4xe and the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe.\nThe PHEV Wrangler has seen strong sales since its introduction, and Jeep hopes it has another winner on its hands with the fifth-generation Grand Cherokee. The two-row Grand Cherokee 4xe uses the same powertrain as the Wrangler 4xe: a turbocharged 2.0 L inline-four engine capable of cranking out 270 hp (199 kW) and 295 lb-ft (400 Nm) of torque is paired with a 134 hp (99 kW) electric motor. The end result is a 375 hp (276 kW) powertrain with 470 lb-ft (639 Nm) of torque, outdoing the 5.7 L V8 (there's also a 293 hp V6 available). All three power plant options are paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\nThere are a few options for configuring the Grand Cherokee 4xe. The base model starts at $60,695, but if you want all the bells and whistles, there's a $76,070 Summit Reserve model. We tested a $71,790 Trailhawk 4xe, which was kitted out with Nappa leather, Jeep's full suite of driver-assist tech, and its Quadra-Drive II 4x4 system with a two-speed transfer case. The Trailhawk also comes with a front-axle disconnect, which will automatically switch the SUV to front-wheel drive if driving conditions don't require both axles.Read 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

It has waved goodbye to USB-B and is inching away from USB-A in favor of the slim, reversible USB-C connector. Data transfer rates have increased so dramatically that we can run powerful setups with high-resolution monitors, speedy external storage, and numerous other devices from the USB Implementers Forum's latest open standard, USB4.\nUSB4 unifies the USB and Intel Thunderbolt protocols for the first time, expanding USB's capabilities while further dividing the technology into different performance classes. Adding features like dynamic bandwidth allocation ensures that USB4 is by far the most advanced USB generation. While there are PCs, docks, and cables supporting USB4, we've yet to see everything the protocol can do, like powering an eGPU without Intel branding.\nWith all that going on, we thought it would be a great time to put a spotlight on the latest and greatest generation of USB. We've whipped up a handy refresher for all things USB4, breaking down the various key aspects of the spec, from how it differs from other specs to protocol tunneling, Alt Mode, and power delivery.\nRead 55 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

When successful, the phishers used the compromised credentials to publish malware that posed as the latest release for legitimate projects associated with the account. PyPI quickly took down the compromised updates and urged all contributors to use phishing-resistant forms of two-factor authentication to protect their accounts better.\nToday we received reports of a phishing campaign targeting PyPI users. This is the first known phishing attack against PyPI. We’re publishing the details here to raise awareness of what is likely an ongoing threat.— Python Package Index (@pypi) August 24, 2022\nOn Thursday, researchers from security firms SentinelOne and Checkmarx said that the supply chain attacks were part of a larger campaign by a group that has been active since at least late last year to spread credential-stealing malware the researchers are dubbing JuiceStealer. Initially, JuiceStealer was spread through a technique known as typosquatting, in which the threat actors seeded PyPI with hundreds of packages that closely resembled the names of well-established ones, in the hopes that some users would accidentally install them.Read 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

However, much less is known about how location data influences state and local law enforcement investigations.

With their Micro OLED displays and required tether to Windows, macOS, Android, or iOS devices, they bring some notable features to a space that has piqued industry-wide interest but is still likely far from becoming ubiquitous.\nThe early version of the T1 I tried had limited features; I was mostly only able to view a homepage with basic menu options and a desktop with icons for apps, like web browsing. Although the glasses weren't ready for me to watch a movie or hop around apps, I was impressed at how clear text and menu items were. This was in a sunny room with exceedingly tall windows. Even when facing sunlight, the few colors on display seemed vibrant and the text legible.\nLenovo specs the displays with 10,000:1 contrast and 1920×1080 pixels per eye. The glasses are also TÜV-certified for low blue light and flicker reduction, according to Lenovo. Much more time is needed to explore and challenge the Micro OLED displays before I pass final judgment. But the combination of smaller pixels and, from what I saw thus far, strong colors, should accommodate screens so close to the eyes. More broadly speaking, brightness can be a concern with OLED technologies, but the small demo I saw fared well in a sun-flushed room.Read 12 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "It’s hard to believe Labor Day is right around the corner —&nbsp;we just got through Memorial Day.&nbsp;Summer cannot end yet. But since the calendar ignores our most fervent wishes, it is a good time to reflect on labor.\n\n\n\nLabor Day celebrates the men and women of this country who fought hard for the rights of workers. It became a U.S. federal holiday in 1894 as a product of the labor movement. But some states officially recognized Labor Day even earlier to pay tribute to the achievements of their workers.\n\n\n\nOn Sept. 5, 1882, New York City union leaders organized what is now considered the country's first Labor Day parade, according to National Geographic. But beyond parades and parties, labor is a serious subject worth reconsidering this year.\n\n\n\nFirstly, labor conditions in America in the 1800s were terrible and led to the formation of the Labor Day holiday following the Pullman Strike, a nationwide railroad boycott that turned fatal and revealed the horrific conditions for many workers.\n\n\n\nThere was a time when the average American put in a 12-hour workday and seven-day work week to make basic wages. Conditions were hazardous. Workers were exploited — especially women and children who labored in sweat shops and mills. \n\n\n\nThe first question: Have labor conditions changed over the years? Yes. Laws improved along with regulation of the workplace and a culture of respect for work. Today, we are discussing the possibility of a four-day work week, working from home and other revolutionary labor concepts that were unthinkable in the last century. We should celebrate some of those freedoms, although not every worker can enjoy them.\n\n\n\nThe second serious question today: Who wants to work, and where? In 2021, a record number of workers left their jobs. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, over 47 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobs — an unprecedented mass exit from the workforce. Worker shortages appeared everywhere, from doctors’ offices to pizzerias. \n\n\n\nWhat is called the “Great Resignation” reflected something broken in the relationship between workers and work. Many complained about work-life balance; others felt uninspired and unsatisfied in their jobs. Many wanted more flexibility in where and when they worked. That is something we still need to address. What has driven people to change jobs so often?\n\n\n\nA Harvard Business School study warns companies and businesses to think about the factors that shifted the labor market before sickness did: “retirement, relocation, reconsideration, reshuffling and reluctance.” These are impulses that are now baked into the workforce.\n\n\n\nWhere financially possible, people want more time with family and friends, and want the freedom to explore places to live and work. Social mobility, transportation and the evolution of work have led to people moving in and out of jobs for years leading up to the COVID-19 outbreak, which exacerbated and accelerated those trends.\n\n\n\nWork is often a partnership between the employer and the employee. Some of these agreements are legislated; others are informal.&nbsp;Work is a human commitment between people, a kind of social contract that makes life possible.\n\n\n\nWork is also a reflection of economic conditions and what people can “afford” to do. When layoffs are at low levels, and demand for employment is high, workers gain leverage to demand higher pay and better conditions — a good thing. Wage growth for the average worker in America was up 6 percent in April, relative to last April — the largest yearly increase in over 20 years, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\n\n\n\nBut the more complex work phenomenon then becomes how hard someone wants to work at the expense of doing other things. A new phenomenon is “quiet quitting,” which is essentially staying at your job but dialing back on the hours. In short, it means deciding not to hustle too much to avoid burnout. \n\n\n\nThe job market today is robust and resilient, despite harsh inflation. But human impulses to work have changed, and the economy is changing. If experts are correct, the job market may shift in a downward direction. Experts say job growth is slowing and unemployment claims are rising. Companies are beginning to consider layoffs, and many report planning to freeze positions. \n\n\n\nThis Labor Day will test the willingness of people to stay in jobs and resist the temptation to find workarounds to work. We need workers in every sector, from health care to commerce. We need pilots to fly planes and assembly workers to keep us competitive and supplied.\n\n\n\nWe also need freedom from work to enjoy our free time. We need to work and not to work. That is going to be a difficult balancing act, as it's always been.\n\n\n\nTara D.&nbsp;Sonenshine&nbsp;is the Edward R. Murrow Professor of Practice for Public Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.",

        "description": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson advised Republican candidates this year not to “emulate” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), telling them that their job is to “make fun” of him.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCarlson said on his show on Friday that Republicans who focus on foreign policy and the Russia-Ukraine war as Graham has done will lose their races this year because voters do not care as much about these issues. \n\n\n\n“Your job is to make fun of Lindsey Graham and to disavow Lindsey Graham,” Carlson said. “Your job is not to emulate Lindsey Graham and steal his talking points, and if you do emulate Lindsey Graham and steal those talking points, you will lose, and the losing candidates did just that.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCarlson pointed to the special election for New York’s 19th Congressional District last month in which Democrat Pat Ryan defeated Republican Marc Molinaro. The district is considered a swing district and narrowly favored President Biden in the 2020 presidential election. \n\n\n\nCarlson said Molinaro, who is the county executive of Dutchess County, which includes the 19th District, told the county office building in February to illuminate its facade in Ukraine’s colors. He added that  Molinaro also sent fundraising emails to voters to tell them that more aggression against Russia is needed and that Biden is weak on the issue. \n\n\n\nIn the past, Graham has been outspoken about foreign policy issues, specifically on U.S.'s withdrawal from Afghanistan one year ago and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \n\n\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News in 2021, Graham said that his relationship with President Biden was at a \"breaking point\" over the administration's bungled and chaotic withdrawal from the country. \n\n\n\n“I’ve known&nbsp;Joe Biden&nbsp;for a long time, I had a good personal relationship with him. He’s a decent man. But what he did in Afghanistan I will never forgive him for, he has blood on his hands, and he’s made America less safe,” Graham said at the time. \n\n\n\nThe South Carolina senator also previously voiced support for a no-fly zone over Ukraine in May if Russia were to use chemical weapons and has been a vocal critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n\n\n\nOn Friday night, Carlson showed a clip from an interview with Joe Kent, the Republican nominee for Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, in which he said members of Congress need to tell their constituents about the “ramifications” of supporting Ukraine and why foreign nations “always come first.” \n\n\n\nCarlson said Americans should feel “sorry” for Ukrainians but have a right to want to focus on fixing the problems in their own country.",

We toured the landmarks – my grandparents’ house, where I was born, the primary school I’d attended – and, of course, my childhood home, the small end-of-terrace I shared with my two big brothers and my father, following my mother’s departure to a tiny flat a mile or so away.Dan and I had been standing outside for no more than a minute or two when the door opened and a friendly older couple asked us if they could help. I told them I’d grown up in their house and they immediately invited us inside for tea. I feel tearful whenever I think of them, not only because their home – now bright, lovingly decorated and happy – holds so many unusual memories for me, but also because the owners were so generous and warm that I somehow felt more at home than I had when I could rightfully call that house my own. As they showed us around, sharing all the work they’d done over the past 30-plus years, the conversation turned to how they’d come to buy the place. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Dan Brink\n    \n\n  Only the Bambino had an especially notable Game 132. Welcome back to the Aaron Judge Home Run Record Tracker! We’re taking a daily look at where Aaron Judge’s monster season tracks compared to some of the other historic single-season home run leaders in anticipation of Judge potentially joining their ranks. We’ll be going by Team Game because not every player’s seasons were in sync with the calendar days and everyone didn’t play all of the team’s games, which makes this our universal standard. Now, for Game 132:\nAaron Judge through Game 132 of 2022: 51 HR\nTeam Game 132: 9/3 — 0-for-2, 1 BB, 2 K, reached on catcher’s interference\nThe Rays followed a similar formula last night that others (including them) followed for most of August, challenging the rest of the Yankees’ lineup to beat them instead. They failed, and Judge whiffed in his only two official at-bats. \nRoger Maris through Game 132 of 1961: 51 HR\nTeam Game 132: 8/30 — 1-for-3, 1 BB, 1 RBI, 1 K\nRoger Maris was in the middle of an unusual five-game homerless drought on August 30th at old Metropolitan Stadium in Minnesota, as future Yankees announcer Jim Kaat held him to a single. On the unusual occasions when one M&amp;M Boy fell short though, the other often picked him up, and sure enough, Mickey Mantle belted his 47th homer of 1961 as part of a 4-0 shutout.\nBabe Ruth through Game 132 of 1927: 46 HR\nTeam Game 132: 9/6 (1) — 2-for-6, 2 HR, 5 RBI, 1 K\nOh hell yeah, here we go. One of my favorite performances in MLB history is Babe Ruth’s September 1927 because breaking his old record of 59 homers with 60 was such an absurd long shot. He was at 44 with just 24 games to go, and the legend ended up hitting 17 homers in a single month.\nThis doubleheader opener at Fenway Park was when the Bambino began to not only kick into high gear, but also to distance himself from breakout star Lou Gehrig, who had been neck-and-neck with Ruth for much of ‘27. Both men entered the day with 44 bombs, and while Gehrig oh-so-briefly pulled ahead with No. 45 in the fifth, Ruth belted a pair in back-to-back innings to reach 46.\nPour one out for Red Sox starter Tony Welzer, who in those days, just had to wear it during a 14-2 drubbing. His final line: 7 innings, 17 hits, 13 runs (all earned), 4 walks, and a trio of homers allowed to all-time legends. Welzer had also coughed up No. 43 less than a week prior, and he never pitched in the majors again after this month. Perhaps he did not have as many fond memories of September ‘27 as Ruth’s supporters.\nBarry Bonds through Game 132 of 2001: 56 HR\nTeam Game 132: 8/28 — 0-for-2, 2 BB\nThis was the start of a key series for both Bonds and the Giants as a whole, as they were trying* to chase down the Diamondbacks for NL West crown and were 2.5 games behind entering play on August 28th. But as so many players knew in those days, it was such a bad matchup to have to deal with Randy Johnson, who to that point had actually never allowed Bonds to take him deep. The man who would win his third consecutive Cy Young Award that year did his job, pitching around Bonds twice to snuff out rallies by retiring lesser hitters, and also inducing a groundout and popup. Johnson’s eight innings of one-run ball led to a 4-1 Arizona victory.\n*Note: I am now coming to the realization that this series will turn the 2001 Giants into my bitter enemy for being unsuccessful in their pursuit of the eventual champion D-backs. Jerks!\n\nMark McGwire through Game 132 of 1998: 53 HR\nTeam Game 132: 8/25 — 0-for-4, 1 BB, 1 RBI, 1 ROE\nThe 1998 Marlins tore down their World Series-winning team from ‘97 and were one of the worst defending champions in MLB history, finishing ‘98 with 108 losses. But hey, baseball works in mysterious ways, and sometimes, an abysmal team can shut down a slugger in the middle of a history. Mark McGwire went hitless with just a bases-loaded walk to show for his effort on August 25th, though a long fly in the first fell a bit shy of No. 54.\nSammy Sosa through Game 132 of 1998: 51 HR\nTeam Game 132: 8/25 — 3-for-5, 1 2B, 3 RBI, 2 K\nHow about that? This was the rare day in the summer of ‘98 that neither Big Mac or Slammin’ Sammy went deep. Sure, he had a good night in Cincinnati with a trio of hits, but none went yard and the Cubs’ pitching staff let the Wild Card contenders down. The Reds outlasted the Cubs, 10-9, thanks to a young third baseman named Aaron Boone going 2-for-4 with a double and a team-high four RBI at the bottom of Jack McKeon’s lineup.",

        "description": "In an extract from her new book, our beauty columnist shares her top tips on how to create the perfect cosy sanctuary – from the power of blankets to how to save on paintSeveral years ago, my boyfriend and I attended the Hay literary festival, and in an uncharacteristic fit of nostalgia I suggested we drive to the village in which I grew up, around 45 minutes away. We toured the landmarks – my grandparents’ house, where I was born, the primary school I’d attended – and, of course, my childhood home, the small end-of-terrace I shared with my two big brothers and my father, following my mother’s departure to a tiny flat a mile or so away.Dan and I had been standing outside for no more than a minute or two when the door opened and a friendly older couple asked us if they could help. I told them I’d grown up in their house and they immediately invited us inside for tea. I feel tearful whenever I think of them, not only because their home – now bright, lovingly decorated and happy – holds so many unusual memories for me, but also because the owners were so generous and warm that I somehow felt more at home than I had when I could rightfully call that house my own. As they showed us around, sharing all the work they’d done over the past 30-plus years, the conversation turned to how they’d come to buy the place. Continue reading...",

Trump’s political team has told others they want to be cooperative and helpful, focusing Trump on rural areas where he has strong support. Talks have included states across the South and Upper Midwest, among others.”\n\n\n\n“But the risk is acute that his presence could distract from what the GOP has sought to make its central message of the midterms: that voters should fire Democrats who have presided over rising costs and violent crime.”",

        "description": "Photo by Meg Oliphant/Getty Images\n    \n\n  From Lance McCullers Jr. to Rafael Montero, it was a solid performance by the Astros’ pitchers. On Friday night, the Astros’ pitching proved once again to be on top form as Houston defeated the Angels with a 4-2 score, making most Anaheim hitters look harmless. From starter Lance McCullers Jr. to interim closer Rafael Montero, it was another solid performance. Plus, Astros’ #3 prospect Yainer Díaz made his MLB debut and recorded his first career RBI.\nMcCullers Jr. outdueled lefty Reid Detmers –who threw the only solo no-hitter of 2022 so far on May 10— going 5 2/3 innings of six hits, two earned runs, four walks, and seven strikeouts. McCullers got in a few jams, but he always found the right pitch to leave a bunch of runners stranded – the Angels went 1-for-9 with RISP and left 10 men on base.\n\n\nLance McCullers: \"I’m not 100% to the sharpness level I’d like, but I’m making strides every game. I was really close to six shutty there ...  Overall I’ve been keeping guys from crossing the plate for the most part. The other stuff will come. When it does, it will be damn good.”— Chandler Rome (@Chandler_Rome) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nThe soon-to-be 29-year-old picked up his second win of the year (2-1) and got his ERA to 2.08. Since 2021, Lance carries a 2.65 ERA against the Angels in six starts (37.1 IP, 23 hits).\n\n\nLance McCullers, Filthy Knuckle Curves.   pic.twitter.com/wAUhEKkdW5— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nIn the third inning, the Astros’ offense got things going. After a Chas McCormick double and a José Altuve single, Jeremy Peña knocked his 17th double of the season off the second pitch by Detmers to drive in the game’s first run. Just seconds later, and against Detmers’ first offering, Alex Bregman hit a sacrifice fly to make it 2-0.\nThen, in the fifth, patience paid off for Houston. Altuve kicked off the inning with a walk, Peña struck out swinging, and Bregman grabbed another free pass. Tucker singled to load the bases and, with Detmers out, reliever José Marte walked Yuli Gurriel (3-0), struck out Trey Mancini, and gave a four-pitch walk to Yainer Díaz for the first RBI of his career (4-0).\n\n\nYainer Diaz swung at the first 5 pitches he saw as a major leaguer. He took the next 4 for a four-pitch walk and his first major league RBI!!Welcome to the show, Yainer!!pic.twitter.com/xWF1PGkwTe— Apollo Media (@ApolloHOU) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Angels had something going in the sixth and they scored twice thanks to a double from Matt Duffy and a sac fly from Matt Thais. But Phil Maton came out of the ‘pen to record the final out of the inning. The night of the bullpen had begun.\nHéctor Neris got out of a two-out jam by punching out Mike Ford. His performance featured a three-pitch strikeout to Shohei Ohtani…\n\nThen, Bryan Abreu made his 15th consecutive scoreless appearance and recorded two Ks to end the eighth and leave the table served for Rafael Montero, who got the final two outs by fanning Mike Trout and Ohtani. Montero, in Ryan Pressly’s absence, got his 11th save of 2022.\n\nLuis García is set to face Ohtani –the pitcher— on Saturday during the second game of the series. Should be an exciting one. The game starts at 8:07 pm CT.\nVIDEOS AND BOX SCORE HERE.",

        "description": "Russia announced Friday that it has delayed exporting natural gas to Germany through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, citing an oil leak. \n\n\n\nThe development comes after a group of Western countries, including the United States, agreed to a price gap on Russian oil amid its war with Ukraine.\n\n\n\nThe Russian state-run energy company Gazprom said in a post on Twitter Friday that an oil leak was discovered during scheduled maintenance within a gas compressor unit. \n\n\n\nWorkers detected the oil in the detachable cable connection of a mounting plate that makes up part of the engine and near the cable line in the outer terminal cabinet of the automated control system, Gazprom said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe pipeline has been shut down since Wednesday for maintenance work.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRussia’s environmental, technological and nuclear supervision agency, Rostekhnadzor, warned that the faults make ensuring the safe operation of the gas turbine engine impossible.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe statement says similar oil leaks have been detected in the past at gas compressor units in three engines, requiring major repairs and that they be taken offline. \n\n\n\nGazprom said Siemens, a German multinational industrial manufacturing company, requires repairs for these types of leaks at a specialized repair facility.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Gas transmission via the Nord Stream gas pipeline has been fully shut down until the operational defects in the equipment are eliminated,” the statement reads.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe news comes as members of the Group of Seven agreed to place a price cap on Russian oil, prohibiting “services which enable maritime transportation” of oil from Russia if it is sold at a price higher than the cap. The move is an attempt to limit Russian profits amid the country’s war in Ukraine. \n\n\n\nA Kremlin official said in response that Russia would not sell oil to any countries that participate in the cap.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRussia is the world’s third-largest producer of oil, and Nord Stream 1 is the largest pipeline for sending natural gas from Russia to the rest of Europe. Some countries, like the United States, have said they will not import Russian oil amid its war with Ukraine, but others like China and India have continued to purchase it. \n\n\n\nCNN reported that Gazprom has cut its flows through Nord Stream 1 to just 20 percent of its capacity since June, citing maintenance problems and a missing turbine that has been restricted through sanctions the West has placed on Russia. \n\n\n\nThe New York Times reported that a European Commission spokesperson said Russia is limiting its gas deliveries in retribution for Europe opposing the war in Ukraine.",

        "description": "Zack Wheeler underwent an MRI Thursday that didn&#8217;t reveal any structural damage, Phillies interim manager Rob Thomson told NBC Sports Philadelphia&#8217;s Jim Salisbury and other reporters.  Wheeler received the testing after feeling soreness during a catch session, and while the issue seems to be just be elbow inflammation, it does present new questions about when Wheeler will be able to return to the rotation.  The right-hander was retroactively placed on the 15-day injured list on August 22, and was expected to miss two starts while recovering from forearm tendinitis.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s feeling better and I&#8217;m sure if this was a playoff game, he&#8217;d say, &#8217;Give me the ball.&#8217;  But he&#8217;s still feeling it a little bit so we&#8217;re going to wait and re-evaluate on Monday or Tuesday,&#8221; Thomson said.  The skipper said he isn&#8217;t too concerned about Wheeler&#8217;s status, but Wheeler won&#8217;t be activated from the IL on Tuesday, his first day of eligibility for reinstatement.  Wheeler is enjoying another strong season and has been a big part of the Phillies&#8217; success, and the club naturally needs the righty back as soon as possible (health permitting) for the stretch run.\nMore on other pitching situations around baseball&#8230;.\n\nDrew Pomeranz has yet to pitch this season after undergoing flexor tendon surgery in August 2021, and his chances of a return seemingly took a hit when his rehab was shut down due to soreness two weeks ago.  However, Padres manager Bob Melvin told reporters (including Kevin Acee of the San Diego Union-Tribune) that Pomeranz played catch on Friday and is slated to throw later this week.  After the shutdown, Pomeranz had a checkup with Dr. Neal ElAttrache but was told that some soreness is a routine part of the recovery process.  &#8220;There’s still a chance to get [Pomeranz] back here before the season is over,&#8221; Melvin said.\nThe Cardinals will activate Jack Flaherty off the 60-day IL Monday for a start against the Nationals.  Shoulder problems have limited Flaherty to only eight innings over three starts this season, marking his second consecutive injury-marred year.  With Flaherty back, Cards manager Oliver Marmol told reporters (including Rick Hummel of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch) that Dakota Hudson will move to the bullpen for now, and might not start again until a doubleheader against the Reds on September 17.  Despite below-average Statcast metrics almost across the board, Hudson has managed a 4.43 ERA over 126 innings, though his SIERA is a less-favorable 5.11.  It doesn&#8217;t seem like either Flaherty or Hudson are candidates for starting assignments in the postseason, though their work in September and October will give Marmol and company more to think about in determining roles on playoff rosters.",

        "description": "Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Cubs had an uphill battle to start this game, and never got untracked. The Cubs entered Friday night’s game against the Cardinals at a serious disadvantage. To wit: Cardinals lefthander Jordan Montgomery had thrown 16 scoreless inning against the Cubs previously this year, allowing just five hits, and last time he faced them he threw a one-hit shutout.\nThen Adrian Sampson began this game by throwing a 40-pitch first inning during which he issued a pair of walks and allowed two RBI singles. It didn’t seem as if he’d go much past that inning.\nGive Sampson a lot of credit. He settled down and threw just 61 pitches over the next four innings, allowing no further runs, and his line — five innings, four hits, two runs, four strikeouts — looked a lot like many of his other starts this year. Here are those four strikeouts [VIDEO], which I show you primarily to break up what otherwise would be a wall of text.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pregame perceived disadvantage turned out to be true fact. The Cubs did manage seven hits and a pair of walks off Montgomery, but could not score off him in six innings. Jordan Hicks and Chris Stratton retired all nine Cubs they faced in the seventh, eighth and ninth and the Cardinals defeated the Cubs easily, 8-0. It was the 10th time the Cubs were shut out this year, the same number of shutouts they had thrown against them in 2021.\nNick Madrigal and Seiya Suzuki both had two hits on the night, which is good; both have been hot hitters lately.\nJavier Assad threw an inning of relief and allowed a run for the first time in his brief MLB career. I mention that run mostly to say that if not for a double-clutched ground ball by Nico Hoerner, he likely gets out of that inning scoreless.\nLastly, I think it’s time to end the Sean Newcomb experiment. Newcomb took a game that was still relatively close at 3-0 heading to the bottom of the seventh and allowed three hits, four walks and five runs in a two-inning outing, including home runs by Lars Nootbaar and Tommy Edman. Newcomb threw only 19 strikes in 47 total pitches, and over his last four appearances: 4⅔ innings, 10 hits, six walks (3.429 WHIP), five home runs, 23.14 ERA. That’s... awful. His 11.09 ERA as a Cub, in 18⅔ innings, is the worst in franchise history for anyone who’s thrown that many innings for the team. No one else is even all that close; here’s the entire list of Cubs pitchers who have thrown that many innings with an ERA over 8.00.\nI’m not usually one to yell, “DFA! DFA!” but... seriously, DFA this guy, he’s not good and clearly not part of this team’s future. Just bring back Anderson Espinoza or Nicholas Padilla or Kervin Castro until Adbert Alzolay is ready to return, those three could not possibly do any worse than Newcomb.\nThat’s all I’ve got on this one. The Cubs and Cardinals will play again Saturday evening. Drew Smyly will start for the Cubs and Adam Wainwright will go for St. Louis. Game time Saturday is 6:15 p.m. CT and TV coverage will be via Marquee Sports Network.",

        "description": "Photo by Jason Miller/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Things didn’t go great for New York on any level last night. The Yankees have found themselves in a situation where they need to win a series off the bat in September to pull themselves out of a tailspin. They didn’t get off to the start they wanted though, turning a close deficit into a full-blown beatdown by the hand of the Rays. That means the division lead is down to just five games, and the Wild Card cushion continues to be threatened as well.\nSpeaking off, let’s see what the rest of the field did. Spoiler alert: They did not help!\n\nToronto Blue Jays 4 (71-59), Pittsburgh Pirates 0 (49-82)\n\nSending Pittsburgh up against Alek Manoah was a mismatch to begin with, and the Blue Jays capitalized on it as much as they could. Manoah twirled 7.1 shutout innings while his team got him an early 2-0 lead in the fourth inning when Santiago Espinal doubled home a pair of runners. Bo Bichette added some insurance in the ninth with a two-run homer, but it was not necessary — the Jays had this one all the way.\n\nToronto still trails Tampa Bay for second in the AL East, though they’re seven games behind New York — the same spot that the Rays were in just a few days ago.\n\nHouston Astros 4 (85-47), Los Angeles Angels 2 (57-75)\n\nLance McCullers Jr. made his fourth start of the year, and so far, he’s jumped into the playoff race in midseason form. McCullers went 5.2 innings in this one, and was cruising until he exited in the sixth after allowed a run-scoring double and a sacrifice fly.\nThe Astros did the same thing in the third inning, but the difference was in the fifth inning, when Reid Detmers walked two and allowed a single to load the bases. He was replaced by Jose Marte, who promptly walked in two runs, the second coming on just four pitches. A quartet of Astros relievers were tasked with holding the lead, and they did just that.\n\nSeattle Mariners 6 (74-58), Cleveland Guardians 1 (68-62)\n\nThis game was the Cal Raleigh and Mitch Haniger show all the way. Haniger started the scoring in the first inning with a double to bring home Julio Rodríguez, and in the second, Raleigh hit a solo shot before Haniger doubled home another run. In the sixth, Raleigh put it away with a three-run jack to put Seattle up 6-0, and all the while Luis Castillo was cruising. The Guardians did get a run to prevent the shutout in the seventh once L. Castillo left the game (replaced by Diego Castillo), but they couldn’t string together anything else.\nLike the Rays, the Mariners have made up a ton of ground on the Yankees, and they sit five back of New York as well if that comes into play.\n\n\nOn June 19, the Yankees were 22 games up on the Mariners in the standings. Tonight, that number is 5— Patrick Dubuque (@euqubud) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nOther Contenders\n\n\nBaltimore Orioles 5 (70-61), Oakland Athletics 2 (49-84): The Orioles won this game on a massive eighth inning rally tied at two, opening with a walk and single before bunting both runners into scoring position. The A’s chose to intentionally walk Cedric Mullins to set up the force play, but ended up walking home a run and then Jorge Mateo opened the floodgates with a two-run single. That helped the O’s keep pace in the Wild Card race at 1.5 games behind Toronto.\n\nChicago White Sox 4 (66-66), Minnesota Twins 3 (67-63): Just when we write off the White Sox, they crawl right back into this mediocre AL Central race. Let’s jump right into the drama in the bottom of the ninth: Andrew Vaughn was hit by a pitch to load the bases, the benches cleared after this (with both managers getting up in each other’s faces), and then Jose Abreu was seemingly hit by a pitch and the White Sox started celebrating — only for the play to be challenged and overruled. Abreu then hit a grounder instead that went off the glove of the pitcher and couldn’t be turned into a double play, re-securing the walk-off for Chicago.\n\n\nCleveland, Minnesota, and Chicago are now separated by only three total games at the top of the AL Central, with the Guardians leading the Twins by one.",

delayed the launch of its Artemis I rocket for a second time on Saturday after engineers detected a liquid hydrogen leak that they were unable to resolve.\n\n\n\nA NASA blog post states that the rocket's launch director called off the launch attempt at 11:17 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time after multiple troubleshooting efforts were not successful in fixing the leak.\n\n\n\nThe Space Launch System rocket was originally set to launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Monday but was delayed after one of the rocket’s engines failed to condition to the correct temperature.

Leaders of the agency plan to hold a press conference on Saturday to discuss the issue and the rocket's status.\n\n\n\nNASA said in a blog post on its website at 7:24 a.m. that engineers stopped flowing the liquid propellant into the core stage, which serves as the backbone of the rocket, while they addressed the leak. They resumed flowing the liquid hydrogen into the core stage twice, but the leak reoccurred both times.\n\n\n\nLaunch controllers attempted to warm up the quick disconnect fitting, which is used to provide easy connection and disconnection of fluid and air lines, to get a tight seal but were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\nThe launch was scheduled to occur between 2:17 p.m. and 4:17 p.m. ET Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe Artemis program plans to send people back to the moon for the first time since 1972 in subsequent missions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Orion exploration spacecraft, which will be unmanned, is planned to travel more than 40,000 miles past the moon before returning to Earth. NASA hopes to send astronauts, including the first woman and person of color to set foot on the moon, to the moon’s surface by 2025 or 2026.\n\n\n\n— Updated at 11:46 a.m.",

        "description": "Recent headlines might give the impression that inflation is under control, but inflation&nbsp;and&nbsp;other threats to agriculture are putting our farms&nbsp;and&nbsp;our food security at risk. Farmers need strong federal farm policies. The stakes have never been higher.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSummer is beautiful on the farm. Our crops are planted,&nbsp;and&nbsp;we normally get to take this season to enjoy the hard work that comes with growing the food that feeds America. This summer, though, we can’t sleep at night.\n\n\n\nWe both grow sugar crops — sugarbeets in North Dakota&nbsp;and&nbsp;sugarcane in Texas — among other commodities. We are certainly no stranger to the challenges that come with trying to navigate Mother Nature or cyclical crop markets. But this year, the disasters keep piling on.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt started with planting. In North Dakota, we were a month late in getting seed into the ground, due to an unseasonably cold&nbsp;and&nbsp;wet spring. The planted crop is looking promising, but the loss of crop protection tools has made growing sugarbeets more challenging&nbsp;and&nbsp;increased the cost of controlling pests, as we have to use less effective products more often. We also had to hire additional labor to even come close to planting our expected number of acres, which meant additional costs.\n\n\n\nTexas, on the other hand, is dealing with such bad drought conditions that some of our neighboring farmers gave up entirely on trying to plant a crop this year. On our farm, we had to purchase additional water to irrigate our crops, adding as much as $700,000 to our farm expenses this year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow, our bills for tractor&nbsp;and&nbsp;truck fuel,&nbsp;along with&nbsp;the fertilizer we need for our crops, are skyrocketing. Some of our costs have increased upwards of 100 percent. In North Dakota, our fuel costs are projected to be up $280,000 over 2021&nbsp;and&nbsp;fertilizer costs are up more than $500,000 over 2021.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn Texas, our fertilizer costs have risen from $180 per ton in 2021 to more than $700 per ton this year. We are making sacrifices everywhere just to pay the bills.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe are both members of grower-owned sugar cooperatives so when we harvest our crops this fall, that sugarcane or sugarbeet will head to our respective cooperatives, where the sugar will be extracted. Higher transportation&nbsp;and&nbsp;production costs at our cooperatives will reduce the prices we receive for our crop. We’re all working hard this year to just break even.\n\n\n\nLike all of America’s farmers, we’re willing to do what it takes to get the job done&nbsp;and&nbsp;feed people across our nation.&nbsp;But as the number of farmers in America continues to dwindle, we need to take our food security seriously, especially as other nations are confronted by growing food scarcity&nbsp;and&nbsp;hunger.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe past few years have dealt agriculture some heavy blows, but thanks to the stability provided by federal farm policies&nbsp;and&nbsp;a sugar policy that costs taxpayers nothing, we have been able to navigate these challenges — so far.&nbsp;Both of our farms have been in our families for several generations,&nbsp;and&nbsp;we want to keep the legacy of farming alive for our children.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf we value a strong food supply, we need America&nbsp;and&nbsp;Congress to continue supporting our farmers, now&nbsp;and&nbsp;in the future.\n\n\n\nJason&nbsp;Schatzke&nbsp;farms sugarbeets, corn, soybeans, black beans, sunflower&nbsp;and&nbsp;wheat in North Dakota.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLance&nbsp;Neuhaus&nbsp;farms sugarcane, citrus, cotton, corn, onions and&nbsp;vegetables&nbsp;and&nbsp;raises cattle along the Rio Grande River in South Texas.&nbsp;",

        "description": "&quot;The Civil War of Amos Abernathy&quot; by Michael LealiCourtesy of HarperCollinsAll this month, to celebrate the start of school, Ask a Bookseller will focus on great reads for kids and teens.Sara Groves of Longfellow Books in Portland, Maine, recommends &quot;The Civil War of Amos Abernathy,&quot; a middle grades novel by debut author Michael Leali.Here&#x27;s the story: 13-year-old Amos is a volunteer at a living history museum, but lately he&#x27;s noticed that he and his friends aren&#x27;t reflected in the 19th century life their sharing with others. Amos is gay, his friend Chloe is Black, and his crush, Ben, is questioning his identity. Amos and his friends go looking for the stories of queer folks, Black people, and women who&#x27;ve been left out. He encounters the story of Albert D.J. Cashier of Illinois, who was born a woman, lived as a man, and fought in the Civil War. Amos begins writing letters to Albert as he tries to imagine himself in America&#x27;s history, and he hatches a plan to share that story.Not everyone in the community is supportive of this plan, and Groves says the culminating scene was inspiring and heartwarming in a way that &quot;just sent fireworks&quot; through her.&quot;The book does a fantastic job of encouraging kids to ask questions about the world and giving them language to think about who writes our histories and why,&quot; says Groves.A note to parents: novels labeled as &quot;middle grade&quot; are generally written for readers ages 8-12. If you&#x27;re unsure whether a novel is middle grade or young adult (YA), check the age of the protagonist. If she or he is 8 to 12 years old, even 13, then it&#x27;s middle grade. There is no upper-age limit on who can read these great titles!",

        "description": "NASA&#x27;s Space Launch System rocket with the Orion spacecraft aboard is seen atop the mobile launcher at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Saturday before the planned launch was scrubbed due to fuel leaks.NASA/Getty ImagesUpdated: Sept. 3, 5:48 PM NASA has delayed any new launch attempt for the Artemis moon mission until at least Sept. 19 after scrapping a planned launch on Saturday.The decision on Saturday morning was the second time in a week the launch had been postponed.The official scrub announcement from Launch Director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson came around 11:19 a.m. ET after several unsuccessful attempts to stop a leak of liquid hydrogen fuel.Officials announced Saturday afternoon that they wouldn&#x27;t attempt another launch during the current launch period, which ends on Tuesday. Instead they said the earliest they could try for another launch would be late September.&quot;We do not launch until we think it&#x27;s right,&quot; NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said.The space agency&#x27;s first effort to launch this rocket had to be scuttled on Monday morning after a sensor indicated that one of the rocket&#x27;s four engines didn&#x27;t seem to be cooling down to the proper temperature of approximately minus-420 degrees Fahrenheit.After studying the problem and troubleshooting, officials said it&#x27;s clear the engine was actually fine and a sensor was giving a false temperature reading.  &quot;We know we had a bad sensor,&quot; said John Honeycutt, program manager for this rocket at NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.Then on Saturday, as crews worked to fuel up the rocket, they repeatedly detected a liquid hydrogen leak that caused them to stop and start the fueling process several times.NASA made three unsuccessful attempts to repair the leak before falling so far behind schedule that Blackwell-Thompson ultimately waived off the launch.Speaking Saturday afternoon, Artemis mission manager Mike Sarafin said the hydrogen transfer line was inadvertently overpressurized but suggested it was too early to tell if that was the cause of the leak.Officials said they would have to roll the rocket back to the Vehicle Assembly Building unless they could get a waiver to remain on the launchpad until the next attempt.It wasn&#x27;t the first time hydrogen leaks have bedeviled efforts to fuel this rocket. Similar ones appeared during dress rehearsals and the first try at launch, though officials described the leak on Saturday as much larger. NASA officials are now studying the problem and discussing next steps.Artemis comes a half century after the last moon landingIt&#x27;s been almost 50 years since the space agency last launched a vehicle designed to carry people to the moon. NASA has named its new moon program Artemis, after the twin sister of the Greek god Apollo, and has vowed to put the first woman and first person of color on the lunar surface.No astronauts will be on board the Artemis rocket during its long-anticipated first mission, but this flight will be a critical test of how NASA&#x27;s new vehicle will perform in space and during the fiery return to Earth. Once this rocket successfully lifts off, it will send a crew capsule called Orion on a journey to orbit the moon, coming within about 60 miles of the lunar surface. After more than five weeks, it will return home and splash down in the Pacific Ocean.The next flight of this rocket will carry people, but it isn&#x27;t scheduled until 2024. The agency is targeting a 2025 moon landing — although most space watchers expect delays, as this rocket is already years behind its original schedule. Congress had wanted it to fly in 2016, just five years after NASA retired its aging fleet of space shuttles.  Nelson said on Saturday that despite the most recent Artemis 1 delays, NASA was still planning to launch Artemis 2 in 2024 and Artemis 3 in 2025.Critics say the Artemis program will be too expensive to be sustainable if NASA depends on this rocket and capsule, which come with a hefty price tag. NASA&#x27;s inspector general has said that each of the first few flights will cost more than $4 billion, and that doesn&#x27;t include billions of dollars in development costs.Meanwhile, the private company SpaceX, which currently ferries astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA, is developing its own megarocket and space vehicle called Starship. This rocket is expected to have its first flight soon and is designed to be both reusable and inexpensive. NASA has already said it will rely on SpaceX to develop Starship as a lunar lander, to get its astronauts from lunar orbit down to the surface.   Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "Brent Skeen-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Orioles keep winning, Tyler Wells loves coffee, Grayson is progressing, and Gunnar is tremendous. Good morning, Birdland!\nThe Orioles are fulling embracing the playoff push, and it is glorious. With rosters now expanded to 28 their dugout is brimming with more talent than its had in years. And the team seems to have a new slogan: Chaos Comin’\nThose two words are emblazoned over the entryway to the home clubhouse at Camden Yards as well as the team website. It is accompanied by an angry Oriole bird with a home run chain around its neck. \nIt’s a neat brand choice that bridges the gap from the rebuild to the rebirth of this franchise. Prior to 2022, the “chaos” that the Orioles provided was a meme applied to every single positive thing the team did on the field. Sweeping both the Astros and Red Sox on the road last season was pretty wild, and so was beating Shohei Ohtani to snap a 19-game losing streak. Bad teams don’t usually do things like that. Chaos!\nThis season, it has taken on a new meaning. Instead of just ruining one weekend for the opposition, it has been a chaotic season in total. Wins over the Orioles are no longer guaranteed. No, the Orioles aren’t just going to fade away from the playoff discussion. The Rays, Blue Jays, and Mariners will have to earn their way into the postseason if they get one at all. You can be sure that the Blue Jays are not excited to face the Orioles 10 more times before the end of the year. Chaos!\nYour scoreboard watching today begins at 6:10, when the Yankees and Rays get things going. The continued spiraling of the Bronx Bombers is hilarious, but it would be nice to see it stop for the next two days. The Blue Jays take on the Pirates at 6:35, and then at 7:15 we have both the Mariners/Guardians and Twins/White Sox games getting started.\nLet’s go O’s! But also go Yankees, Pirates, Guardians and White Sox...for today.\nLinks\nTo Orioles’ Tyler Wells, a love for baseball and coffee go hand in hand: ‘It’s so fun’ | The Baltimore SunI would love to see Wells review some chain coffee spots. He’s an enthusiast and clearly takes his coffee quite seriously. Let’s see how the public reacts to his takedown of Royal Farms java.\nOrioles’ Grayson Rodriguez: Moving rehab to Double-A | CBS SportsGood news! Sounds like the first rehab stint went off without a hitch. He will see his pitch count jump up a bit further, and hopefully make a spot start or two in Baltimore by season’s end.\nStanding O! Gunnar doubles twice in stellar home debut | MLB.comStruggles may still be coming for GUNNAR, but they haven’t happened just yet. What a player!\nDL Hall finally makes it to home clubhouse | Roch KubatkoIt’s almost surreal that the Orioles have so many of their top prospects on the big league roster right now. It’s finally happening! And it is entirely possible that within the next 12 months we could also see the likes of Rodriguez and Colton Cowser also seeing significant time on the big league field as well.\nOrioles birthdays \nIs it your birthday? Happy birthday!\n\nTroy Patton turns 37. The lefty was part of the return in a trade that sent Miguel Tejada to Houston, and he was later dealt to the Padres in exchange for Nick Hundley. In between he spent parts of five mostly-solid seasons with the Orioles, compiling a 3.26 ERA over 140 appearances out of their bullpen.\nRene Gonzales celebrates his 62nd. He was a utility infielder for the Orioles from 1987 through 1990. Defense was his calling card as Gonzales had just a .555 OPS across four seasons with the Birds.\nThe late Morrie Martin (d. 2010) was born on this day in 1922. The southpaw appeared in nine games for the 1956 Orioles.\nAnother posthumous birthday for Sandy Consuegra (b. 1920, d. 2005). His Orioles career spanned all of nine games between the 1956 and ‘57 seasons.\n\nThis day in O’s history\n1960 - The Orioles beat the Yankees 2-0 to take back first place in the AL. It was a tough night for the home plate umpire Larry Napp, who was hit by three foul balls and had to be replaced by Chuck Berry (not that one!) midway through the game.\n1979 - Mike Flanagan becomes MLB’s first 20-game winner of the year as he finishes off a double-header sweep of the Toronto Blue Jays.\n2012 - The Orioles draw within one game of the AL East-leading Yankees. Joe Saunders cruises to a 4-0 win over Toronto while the Rays top the Yanks 4-3.",

        "description": "In the past weeks I&#8217;ve been playing at times in OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-3 playground. You give GPT-3 a prompt and then it will provide some generated text. You could use that as prompt again, or add something yourself and let GPT-3 continue.\nThis morning, I read Liam Porr&#8217;s 2020 posting about a GPT-3 generated blog he kept for a few weeks. (I think keeping it up longer and positioning it like a personal blog would mean certain detection as generated or inauthentic. Unlike when Porr did his experiment, GPT-3 is now available to many, and more people would also be suspicious of texts as potentially generated to begin with.) \nFor fun I prompted the GPT-3 playground with the title and first few lines of my last posting on my recent use of the Hypothes.is social annotation tool.\nMy post remade by GPT-3\nBelow is the result GPT-3 gave me. After pasting the block-quoted part from the original as prompt, it generated the grey coded part.\n\n10 Thoughts After Making 100 Annotations in Hypothes.is\nI’ve now added over 100 annotations using Hypothes.is (h.), almost all within the last month. This includes a few non-public ones. Two weeks ago I wrote down some early impressions, to which I’m now adding some additional observations.\n 1) 100 annotations (in a month) don’t seem like a lot to me, if h. is a regular tool in one’s browsing habit.\n 2) The act of annotation feels good, even empowering. It’s a way of taking control of the web, or at least of one’s web experience. \n 3) Annotations can be very short, even just a single word. This is both good (e.g. for quickly annotating a lot of text) and bad (e.g. when trying to make a more nuanced point).\n 4) The annotation interface could be improved. In particular, it would be nice to have an easy way to see all annotations on a page, without having to open each one individually.\n 5) Annotations can be a great way to start a conversation. I’ve had a few annotations that have generated discussion, which is gratifying.\n 6) Annotations can also be a great way to keep track of thoughts and ideas. I’ve found myself using h. as a kind of “digital scratchpad”, jotting down things that I want to remember or follow up on later.\n 7) The fact that annotations are public by default is both good and bad. On the one hand, it encourages people to be thoughtful and considerate in their annotations. On the other hand, it can be intimidating, and I’ve found myself self-censoring on occasion.\n 8) The fact that annotations are tied to a specific URL can be both good and bad. On the one hand, it ensures that annotations are always relevant to the context in which they were made. On the other hand, it can be frustrating when the context changes (e.g. an article is updated) and the annotation is no longer relevant.\n 9) The fact that annotations are stored centrally (on h.'s servers) is both good and bad. On the one hand, it makes it easy to access and share annotations. On the other hand, it raises privacy and security concerns.\n  10) Overall, I’m very happy with h. and find it to be a valuable tool. I’m looking forward to using it more in the future.\nSome first reactions to that GPT-3 text\n\nThe title (10 things about&#8230;) and partly adding the first numbered element, created the expected 10 point list. It&#8217;s a common enough marketing/personal branding type format for GPT-3 to pick up on. (Why did I use it yesterday? Because I was too lazy to categorize my observations, so I just listed and numbered them as I wrote them.)\nIgnoring obvious things like the repetitiveness of the text, after reading you&#8217;re left with feeling like you&#8217;ve read a bunch of words but you remain unsure if you read anything of substance. The text suggests there&#8217;s substance though, the first person perspective, mentioning specific aspects. Yet then doesn&#8217;t really follow up. It reads like marketing text, content farmed text. It mentions things but doesn&#8217;t answer questions, nor pose them. Not a surprise, but it does show how much empty stuff there&#8217;s already out there (on which GPT-3 was trained in the first place). I recognise it as low-info text but not necessarily as generated text.\nNo links! No links, other than sporadic internal links, is the default in the media, I know. Yet hyperlinks are the strands the Web is made of. It allows pointing to side paths of relevance, to the history and context of which the posting itself is a result, the conversation it is intended to be part of and situated in. Its absence, the pretense that the artefact is a stand alone and self contained thing, is a tell. It&#8217;s also a weakness in other online texts, or any text, as books and journals can be filled with links in the shape of footnotes, references and mentions in the text itself)\nNo proof of work (to borrow a term) other than that the words have been written is conveyed by the text. No world behind the text, of which the text is a resulting expression. No examples that suggest or proof the author tried things out, looked things up. Compare that to the actual posting that in point 1 talks about social connections around the topic, links to other h. user profiles as data points for comparison, and elsewhere points to examples of behaviour, lists of h. users found created and shared, references other tools (Zotero, Obsidian) and larger scope (PKM workflows) outside the topic at hand, and experimental changes in the site it is published on itself. That all tells of some exploration, of which the posting is the annotation. This also goes back to my earlier remark of using a 10 point list as laziness in the face of categorising things as I&#8217;ve done in other posts (see what I did there? No links, cause lazy). \n\nI think that&#8217;s the biggest thing that I take from this: any text should at least hint at the rich tapestry of things it is resulting from, if not directly discuss it or link to it. A tapestry not just made from other texts, but other actions taken (things created, data collected, tools made or adapted), and people (whose thoughts you build on, whose behaviour you observe and adopt, who you interact with outside of the given text). Whether it&#8217;s been GPT-3 generated or not, that holds.",

The city’s largely independent music scene has produced international success stories from the likes of jazz-fusionists Hiatus Kaiyote to punk newcomers Amyl and the Sniffers. Now, trio Telenova – comprised of ex-members of Melbourne groups Miami Horror and Slum Sociable – add their names to this roster with hook-laden pop numbers that reference everything from trip-hop to doo-wop.After releasing their debut EP, Tranquilize, in 2021, the group earned comparisons to Portishead for vocalist Angeline Armstrong’s husky delivery and bandmates Edward Quinn and Joshua Moriarty’s head-nodding, sludgy grooves. On their latest EP, Stained Glass Love, they alter their sound to encompass the singalong, Amy Winehouse-esque fanfares of Haunted, the euphoric driving rhythms of the title track and the 2000s indie-pop of Why Do I Keep You?Stained Glass Love is out now Continue reading...",

The dugouts cleared. And moments later, the White Sox were celebrating.José Abreu drove in the winning run when he grounded into a force out in the ninth inning after Twins closer Jorge López hit Vaughn, and Chicago beat Minnesota 4-3 on Friday night.The White Sox had runners on first and second with one out after back-to-back singles by Romy Gonzalez and Elvis Andrus. They loaded the bases when Lopez hit Vaughn in the left shoulder with the next pitch.The dugouts and bullpens emptied. Twins manager Rocco Baldelli and White Sox bench coach Miguel Cairo jawed at each other. Both benches were warned. Cairo came back out and had words with crew chief Ron Kulpa before heading to the clubhouse.“What I saw was him saying something, their pitcher López saying something to Vaughnie,” Cairo said. “He was just talking. Vaughnie didn’t do nothing. So I went over there just to protect my player. The way he came out and protected his player.”Baldelli had a different take.“I don’t like how that entire group ends up on our mound approaching our pitcher like that,” he said. “I thought that was wrong. But it’s an emotional game, and both teams are just trying to win.”López insisted he wasn&#x27;t trying to hit Vaughn, who he said was “kind of giving me the ‘whatever’ face.”“I’ve been throwing inside the whole year,” Lopez said. “I came here last time with Baltimore and I did the same thing. If they don’t like me pitching in, that’s something they can’t take out of me.”Lopez (4-7) then appeared to hit Abreu with the next pitch, setting off a celebration by the White Sox. The ball apparently grazed the bat and the call was overturned. Chicago won it two pitches later when Abreu&#x27;s grounder deflected off the pitcher&#x27;s glove. Second baseman Nick Gordon fielded the ball and flipped it to shortstop Carlos Correa to get Vaughn at second. The Twins were unable to complete the double play, allowing Gonzalez to score from third.Rookie Davis Martin threw three-hit ball over five scoreless innings in relief. Yasmani Grandal hit a tying home run in the eighth against Caleb Thielbar after Minnesota scored in the top half to take a 3-2 lead, and Liam Hendriks (3-3) pitched around a single in the ninth.The White Sox won their third in a row after losing 10 of 12. They pulled within three games of first-place Cleveland and prevented the Twins from tying the Guardians for the AL Central lead.The White Sox also improved to 3-1 with Cairo filling in for ailing manager Tony La Russa. The Hall of Fame skipper is in Arizona tending to an unspecified medical condition.The Twins looked like they were in position to tie Cleveland for the AL Central lead. Instead, they lost their second straight after winning five in a row.Minnesota’s Nick Gordon smacked a two-run double off Joe Kelly in the first inning. He also put Cleveland ahead 3-2 lead in the eighth when he drove in Max Kepler with a groundout against Jimmy Lambert, giving him 11 RBIs in the past three games.Twins starter Sonny Gray exited after four innings because of tightness in his right hamstring.

        "description": "Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images\n    \n\n  What’s been the cause of Cooper’s extended slump? A first-time MLB All-Star selection is a big deal for most players and Garrett Cooper is no exception. He got the news on July 12 that he had made the cut as an injury replacement, thanks to the support he had received on the player’s ballot. Speaking about the recognition that same day on Miami Mic’d Up with Jeremy Taché, Cooper described it as being one of the key “personal objectives of mine throughout my whole career.” \nAn All-Star selection is supposed to validate what a player has accomplished during their current season, serving as positive reinforcement to continue what they’ve been doing in the second half.\nFor Garrett Cooper, unfortunately, everything has been different since then. The announcement was an inflection point in his 2022 campaign. Since July 12, he shows up on the short list of MLB’s worst hitters. His .081 batting average during that span is dead last among 377 hitters who have had semi-regular playing time.\n  \n        \n      FanGraphs\n      Lowest wRC+ in the majors since July 12 (min. 50 PA)\n  \n\nIf you have followed Cooper’s career closely, you’re aware of the other prolonged slumps he’s had. During approximately the same stretch of the 2019 calendar, his bat went ice cold, and through the first quarter of the 2021 season, he was arguably the least valuable player on the Marlins roster. But the 31-year-old is taking his struggles to a new extreme right now. It’s been so bad that his overall offensive numbers have dipped below the standards he set in each of his three previous years as a bonafide major leaguer.\nI reject the notion that Cooper’s demise can be explained by a simple lack of motivation. When his season began taking a wrong turn, the Marlins were still within striking distance of a postseason berth (five games back of the last National League Wild Card spot and only three back in the loss column). He is also in the midst of his arbitration years—compiling individual stats directly boosts his 2023 salary, strongly incentivizing him to keep grinding even while the team plummeted in the standings.\nShould the Marlins tender a contract to Cooper for next year, who grades out as a slightly above-average hitter this season with only slightly more than replacement-level value when factoring in his defense and baserunning? The fact that the question doesn’t have an obvious answer speaks to how ugly this slump has been.\n  \n        \n      Fish Stripes original GIF\n  \n\nDuring his slump, Cooper is striking out far more than usual. It has happened in 34.1% of his plate appearances for somebody who ordinarily hovers in the mid-20s.\nHowever, the most noticeable difference has been Cooper’s results on balls in play. From 2019-2021, he quietly ranked among baseball’s best at finding the holes in opposing defenses. That held true through three-plus months of this season. He posted a .379 BABIP entering July 12.\nThe numbers on their own cannot sufficiently express how astonishing the drop-off has been lately. It’s such a stark departure from any other stretch of Cooper’s career.\nJust look:\n  \n        \n  \n\nA player can compensate for bad batted ball luck by drawing a lot of walks or mashing balls over the wall occasionally. Alas, Cooper is homerless during this period.\nWhat made Cooper successful particularly during his red-hot month of June was his right-center approach, as he explained to Jordan McPherson of the Miami Herald: \n“Early on the year, I think I was trying to do a little bit too much, rolling over a lot of balls to third and short. Just staying staying through the ball is a big thing for me. To get my arms extended, even on pitches down and in, I can still keep the hands through the ball to drive to right-center. I’m at my best when I’m hitting the ball to center and right.”\nIndeed, Cooper in late April/early May was uncharacteristically sending the majority of batted balls to the pull side. He is trending in that undesirable direction again. Paired with a lack of hard contact and being overly aggressive on pitches outside the strike zone, it’s a recipe for failure. \n\nUnless there are lingering effects from his recent concussion scare that we are unaware of, I would expect Cooper to troubleshoot his approach like he has in the past, and if nothing else, boost his batting average in the coming weeks. He is far from the Marlins’ biggest concern offensively, which speaks to how dire the franchise’s outlook is.\nDuring Cooper’s slump, the Marlins rank 30th among MLB teams in runs scored (109) and wRC+ (67) as well as each of the triple-slash categories. They are tied for last with 26 homers. Cooper has continued to bat in the heart of the lineup because all of the alternatives stink.\nAs discussed at length on Friday’s episode of Fish Stripes LIVE, the roadmap to revamping the Marlins offense for 2023 given their limited resources and underwhelming in-house solutions is murky.",

        "description": "The Orioles announced yesterday that right-hander Denyi Reyes has been assigned to Triple-A after being outrighted off the team&#8217;s 40-man roster.  Reyes was designated for assignment on Wednesday and cleared waivers.\nReyes is a veteran of seven pro seasons, with the first six coming in the Red Sox organization before he inked a minor league free agent deal with Baltimore this past offseason.  This time with the O&#8217;s saw Reyes make his Major League debut, as he tossed 7 2/3 innings over three appearances (posting a 2.35 ERA) this season.\nControl has been Reyes&#8217; biggest asset during his career, as he has only a 3.7% walk rate over his 584 1/3 innings in the minor leagues.  While Reyes has always been able to avoid free passes, his overall results have diminished as he has moved up the minor league ladder, resulting in a 4.18 ERA in 209 Double-A innings and an ugly 7.50 ERA in 42 frames of Triple-A ball.  Home runs have increasingly become a problem for Reyes, as his homer rate has spiked over the last two seasons.\nSince he was previously outrighted off Boston&#8217;s roster back in 2020, Reyes had the ability to reject the Orioles&#8217; outright assignment in favor of becoming a free agent.  With no word yet on his decision, it appears for now as if he&#8217;ll remain in the organization, giving the O&#8217;s some extra long relief depth.  Reyes has started 81 of 126 career games in the minors, but has seen more work as something of a swingman over the last two seasons.",

        "description": "Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Yankees have badly struggled in the second half, and their primary hitting coach also deserves some of the heat. The New York Yankees had the majors’ best offense in the first half. I know, it seems like ages ago, but in reality, it was just about seven weeks ago. Before the break, they led the majors in fWAR with 22.7, and in wRC+ with 122. They were also first in runs scored with 497, and home runs with 157. They were on top of the world.\nBefore Friday’s game, New York fell to third in wRC+ (115) and fWAR, with 27.5, because they have been sleepwalking during the entire second half. At the time of this article’s submission, the numbers hadn’t updated, but Friday’s embarrassing shutout at the Trop only sank them lower.\nSince the All-Star break, New York’s offense is nowhere to be found. They are 15th in fWAR with 4.9, 19th in wRC+ with 97 (below the league average), and 19th in runs scored, with 155. They are sixth in home runs only because of Aaron Judge: they would be a bottom-barrel team in the power department without him, at least in the second half.\n\n\nYankees Offense Since All-Star Break (39 G)Aaron Judge.326/.476/.780, 18 HR, 43 RBI, 30 REveryone Else.214/.282/.333, 30 HR, 105 RBI, 125 R— James Smyth (@JamesSmyth621) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nOf course, not all the issues with the Yanks’ bats have to do with performance: injuries have also played a role. Giancarlo Stanton missed time with an Achilles problem and hasn’t found his rhythm since returning. Matt Carpenter fractured his foot and is out until late September. Even among those not on the IL, Anthony Rizzo has been dealing with back pain on and off and is not with the team in Tampa, while DJ LeMahieu is likewise affected by a toe injury that even Aaron Boone admitted had sapped his power.\nNew York’s extensive injury history this summer, however, does not mean that there isn’t a serious issue with the offense since July. The unit is just not competitive at the moment, and this has been the case for a while.\nLook at how some of the Yankees’ regulars have performed since the All-Star Game, in terms of wRC+:\n\nThe Yankees, more than ever, should be thankful that Aaron Judge plays for them, because if it wasn’t for him, God knows where they would be.\nHitting in MLB is obviously not easy. Ending a prolonged slump and turning a season around is, evidently, a challenge for each struggling hitter on an individual level, but it’s also a challenge for Yankees’ hitting coach Dillon Lawson (and assistants Casey Dykes and Hensley Meulens).\nEvery hitter presents a different challenge for the hitting coach. Baseball is a game of constant adjustments, and it doesn’t seem the Yankees offense has been able to adjust back. Each player is responsible for what he can control, but this extended stretch is Lawson’s first major adversity period in his short stint as the Yankees’ hitting coach since being hired in December 2021. Obviously, he’s not the guy swinging the bats, but he must find a way for the team to produce more.\nLawson has the tools to work things out. He has the knowledge (here is a peek at his resume upon taking over the Yankees’ hitting), the experience, and the philosophy. His “hit strikes hard” motto worked for a sustained period of time, and his methodology also yielded terrific results with the Yanks’ minor leaguers in the past. MLB pitchers are the best in the world, so they made some adjustments against certain hitters.\nIt will be up to the Yankees’ hitters to adjust back, and to do that, they need the help and guidance of their hitting coach. After all, not all batters have the same issues: some may be expanding the zone, others might be showing passivity, and so on. \nNow, it’s Lawson’s time to shine. It’s his job to correctly diagnose what ails each one of his struggling hitters, and come up with mechanical and/or approach-related solutions. Again, it’s an extremely difficult job, but the Yankees trusted him to occupy the role for a reason.",

        "description": "Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Soroka’s road back to Atlanta gave us its best outing so far There were some good times on the Atlanta Braves farm system tonight as both Mike Soroka and Ozzie Albies turned in fine performances for the Gwinnett Stripers. There were also some bad times as first round pick Owen Murphy had an awful second start for Augusta as they got absolutely crushed by Salem.\n(60-66) Gwinnett Stripers 7, (68-58) Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp 0 SUSPENDED\nBox Score\n\nOzzie Albies, DH: 2-3, RBI\nAlex Dickerson, RF: 1-1, HR, 2 RBI\nTyler White, 1B: 1-2, HR, 3 RBI\nMike Soroka, SP: 4 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 5 K, 4.50 ERA\n\nIt was a big evening for those hoping for Atlanta’s stars to come back healthy as both Ozzie Albies and Mike Soroka gave us promising performances in Gwinnett’s short Friday. Albies led off the first inning for Gwinnett with a single, but a double play erased him and both teams stayed locked scoreless until the third inning. Here a two out walk from Rylan Bannon and an error on a grounder from Taylor Motter would open the floodgates for the Stripers to jump on top. Hernan Perez drove in Bannon with an RBI single and Tyler White cleared the bases with his 16th home run to break the game open at 4-0. Albies got back on the board in the fourth inning with an RBI single and then was able to give his foot a rest as he just needed to jog home on Alex Dickerson’s home run. That home run was the last play before rain halted action. \nThe only thing that was stopping Mike Soroka in last night’s game was the weather because he turned in a vintage Maple Maddux outing in a dicing of the Jumbo Shrimp. He started the game out with two strikeouts and a ground out in the first inning to set the tone for what was to come. The only baserunner he allowed in this game was a two out single in the second inning which was quickly followed by an inning ending strikeout. He struck out the next two batters after this before getting four consecutive ground ball outs to end his outing. That is still a notable point however, as Soroka has struggled the second time through lineups. He struck out five of the first nine batters he faced but in the second look at him those four jumbo shrimp hitters were able to make contact though without any success at finding hits. \nGame Resumes: 9/3 vs (68-58) Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp @ 5:05 PM ET\n\n(57-66) Mississippi Braves 9, (66-58) Tennessee Smokies 7\nBox Score\n\nCody Milligan, 2B: 2-3, 2 BB, 2 RBI, .288/.357/.324\nJavier Valdez, C: 1-3, BB, RBI, .265/.446/.449\nJustyn-Henry Malloy, LF: 1-4, BB, RBI, .286/.406/.456\nAlan Rangel, SP:  5 IP, 7 H, 4 R, 3 ER, 1 BB, 4 K, 4.94 ERA\nJustin Yeager, RP: 1 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K, 3.82 ERA\n\nMississippi had trouble slowing down the Tennessee offense but produced enough firepower of their own to keep pace and win the game with a late comeback. The Braves only managed one hit their first time through the order but in the fourth finally got the bats moving. Cody Milligan drew a walk to lead off the inning and Jalen Miller’s double but both men in scoring position for the middle of the order. While no one managed to get a hit Justyn-Henry Malloy and Drew Lugbauer each recorded RBI ground outs to bring Mississippi back to a 3-2 deficit. The pitching staff then gave those two runs back and going into the sixth the Braves were down 5-2. Once again Milligan led off by getting on base, this time with a single, but Miller grounded into a double play to give Mississippi two quick outs. The Braves had a two out rally planned though, with Malloy’s single starting it off. Lugbauer followed with a walk and Javier Valdes broke through with an RBI double. Cade Bunnell had the big hit of the inning and drove in Lugbauer and Valdes on a double to tie the game at 5-5. Mississippi’s bullpen still couldn’t hold the Smokies off of the board and the Braves were once again down with a 7-5 deficit heading into the eighth inning. That Lugbauer, Valdes, Bunnell trio got the clutch rally started as they loaded the bases with no outs in the inning. This brought up Riley Delgado who ripped a double down the left field line to tie the game at seven. Not too long later Milligan came through with a two-run single to put Mississippi on top for the first time in the game.\nMississippi’s pitching staff really struggled in this game as all but one pitcher they ran out there allowed at least one run. Alan Rangel got off to a poor start when he allowed two runs in the first inning and kept that going when a solo home run in the second made it 3-0. After that home run he retired nine of the next ten batters he faced, but couldn’t get through the fifth without allowing another run to score on two more hits. After five the bullpen took over, and the first batter Kyle Wilcox faced took him deep to extend Tennessee’s lead to 5-2. Jake Higginbotham only allowed one hit in the seventh inning, but the runner stole second and third base to be in position to score the go-ahead run on a sacrifice fly. Jasseel De La Cruz allowed a run on two hits in the eighth inning, but got the win as Mississippi was able to make a comeback after that. Justin Yeager finally brought some peace to the box score as he worked around a leadoff walk to pitch a scoreless ninth and earn his fifth save. \nNext Game: 9/3 vs (66-58)Tennessee Smokies @ 7:05 PM ET\n\n(70-52) Rome Braves 5, (48-75) Greenville Drive 8\nBox Score\n\nKeshawn Ogans, 2B: 1-3, RBI, .333/.375/.333\nCal Conley, SS: 1-3, 2B, BB, .258/.335/.421\nBrandol Mezquita, CF: 1-4, RBI, .244/.313/.293\nJJ Niekro, SP: 4 IP, 5 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 1 BB, 6 K, 5.23  ERA\nDavis Schwab, RP: 1 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 3 K, 4.69 ERA\n\nBullpen woes sank Rome to their third loss this week, though they remain seven games up on the second playoff spot with less than two weeks to play. Jacob Pearson put the Braves on top in the first inning when he lead off with a single, stole second base then advanced on a ground out and sacrifice fly to score. While Greenville was able to overcome that lead quickly the Braves were not yet down. Cal Conley doubled and scored on an error to tie the game in the fourth inning and Beau Philip gave Rome the lead with his 12th home run of the season. Bryson Horne doubled to score Brandon Parker to complete a three run inning and put Rome up 4-2. Rome’s offense fell off after this however with the only other run scored coming on a base hit from Brandol Mezquita in the eighth inning. \nJJ Niekro put up a solid start for Rome though he had one inning in which everything fell against him. Niekro had allowed only one hit through two innings but got into trouble in the fifth inning when each of the first three hitters found holes for singles. After a strikeout for the first out of the inning Niekro allowed a fourth hit which gave Greenville a 2-1 lead. Overall in four innings Niekro recorded 11 of his 12 outs via ground out or strikeout, but had his line tainted when those ground balls found holes in the third inning. The rest of the bullpen did not see the same success Niekro had as they allowed six runs over five innings. Ronaldo Alesandro allowed the first of three two-run home runs in the game which tied the game in the sixth inning. One inning later the leadoff batter reached on an error against Alex Segal, which came back to bite him on a two-out, two-run home run that gave Greenville a lead. Davis Schwab avoided the big hit with a scoreless eighth inning, but it was right back to old ways in the ninth when Austin Smith surrendered a two-run home run to ice the game. \nNext Game: 9/3 vs (48-75) Greenville Drive @ 6:00 PM ET\n\n\n(63-60) Augusta GreenJackets 3, (63-60) Salem Red Sox 17\n\nBox Score\n\nKadon Morton, RF: 1-5, HR, .227/.342/.385\nStephen Paolini, LF: 1-3, HR, BB, .217/.327/.332\nFrancisco Floyd, 2B: 1-4, HR, .248/.348/.368\nOwen Murphy, SP: 0.1 IP, 2 H, 5 R, 5 ER, 3 BB, 1 K, 18.00 ERA\nRob Griswold, RP: 1 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K, 4.24 ERA\n\nI honestly wouldn’t blame you if you just exited the window on this one because it’s gonna be just as awful to read as i was to witness. We’ll start with the good news. Stephen Paolini and Kadon Morton each kept their strong second halves going as they hit home runs. Paolini has six of his seven home runs in 41 games since the start of July while posting a respectable 22.6% strikeout rate and 13.6% walk rate. Morton has likewise come alive with five home runs in his past nine games and a .254/.378/.500 line over his past 36 games. Now we will get into the bad news, which is everything else that occurred in this game.\nOwen Murphy’s second Single-A start is best forgotten about as his command was awful and he allowed five runs while recording only one out. Estarlin Rodriguez didn’t give anyone much more to cheer about as he allowed six runs over 2 2⁄3 innings as Salem jumped to an 11-0 lead. This tasked Juan Mateo with just eating up some garbage time innings, and he gave Augusta four of those albeit with five runs allowed on two home runs. Rob Griswold gave Augusta their only scoreless inning as he shut down the Red Sox with a clutch ninth inning performance. \nNext Game: 9/3 vs (63-60) Salem Red Sox @ 6:05 PM ET",

        "description": "“What is a cynic?  A man who knows the price of everything, and the value of nothing.” Oscar Wilde\n\n\n\nRecently, the notion that investment funds do good in the world by using their considerable influence to steer the for-profit firms that they invest in towards helping combat societal ills came under new and severe criticism.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe attorney general of Arizona, along with attorneys-general from 18 other states, wrote an&nbsp;open letter to BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, suggesting that its reliance on&nbsp;environmental, social and governance&nbsp;(ESG) criteria in its investment decisions puts the funds that they manage for their clients (including many state employee retirement funds) at unnecessary risk. The “Wall Street Journal” editorial board co-signed to this position in an I-told-you-so-style editorial titled, “The ESG investing backlash has arrived.” Florida governor, and potential Republican presidential candidate, Ron DeSantis even&nbsp;publicly presented new legislation&nbsp;that would prohibit Florida’s state fund managers from considering ESG information when investing state money.\n\n\n\nFor three years now, the MIT Center for Transportation &amp; Logistics and the Council for Supply Chain Management Professionals have conducted an annual survey of global supply chain managers regarding their firms’ sustainability efforts. From what we see in the research, what critics of ESG investing get right is that (1) investors are a leading driver of pressure on firms to improve their sustainability, and (2) that ‘sustainability’ means very different things to different people.  \n\n\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, we observed that investors were by far the fastest-growing driver of sustainability pressure on firms. At the same, the understanding of what exactly ESG and supply chain sustainability entails changes depending on the geography, industry and year that we ask. For instance, is corporate sustainability just climate change mitigation, or does it also include human rights protection and diversity, equity and inclusion? Put simply, executives and investors around the world are not in agreement on what business sustainability entails and how best to practice it. In that sense then, it’s reasonable to assume that some firms might feel investor pressure steering them towards an ESG vision that seems to them foreign or unclear.\n\n\n\nBut thinking more deeply, this criticism misses two important points. First, that these critics themselves disagree with BlackRock’s or others’ prioritization of ESG measures — or can imagine constituents, or readers of theirs who might disagree — does not on its own merit total rejection from investors. Nor does it merit, as some ESG critics suggest, a single-minded return to solely prioritizing bottom-line profit.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIndividual attitudes about ESG and sustainability aside, inattention to supply chain sustainability leaves for-profit firms vulnerable to precisely the kinds of public relations disasters and supply chain disruptions that ESG and sustainability efforts endeavor to eliminate. These are the human rights scandals and environmental transgressions that make headlines, diminish brand value and negatively affect both stock price and continuity of supply. Critics who only see how ESG efforts cost the firm are in this sense, too myopic for modern practice. They fail to see that an equally strong case can be made that supply chain sustainability efforts actually protect a firm and its brand, and therefore, its investors. ESG investing is, in this sense, practical insurance, not some high-minded dalliance as the growing chorus of ESG critics suggest.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSecond, while the cynics are correct to point out that sustainability prioritizations change with time — our survey clearly confirms their observation here — it is not necessarily correct to imply, as the cynics have, that this transience reveals that ESG and sustainability goals are themselves some kind of unserious scam. Eager critics like the attorney general of Arizona cite the example of European governments now forgoing their environmentally motivated closures of coal — and nuclear-fired power plants in order to prepare for the threat of Russia withholding its natural gas for heating this winter. This unfortunate geopolitical after-effect of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is presented by the cynics as some kind of proof that the ESG stuff is all fluff and no substance when push comes to shove.&nbsp; But this is an incomplete picture of how sustainability efforts appear to be affected by crisis.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor the last two years, our study has directly asked supply chain management professionals worldwide how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted their commitment to supply chain sustainability. For two years in a row now, approximately 80 percent of respondents have answered that their firm’s commitment to supply chain sustainability stayed the same or even increased during the global pandemic. In interviews with executives, we heard repeatedly that the COVID-19 crisis brought with it important new opportunities to rethink old systems. In times of crisis, prudent managers adapt, and they innovate with sustainability and resilience in mind. Sure, European governments are currently stalling their plans to shelve coal. But&nbsp;they are also taking unprecedented action to rationalize their overall energy demand too&nbsp;by identifying and eliminating wasteful consumption where they can. The ESG critics are misreading signals here, mistakenly interpreting helpful adaptation and innovation as weakness and capriciousness.\n\n\n\nIn any disagreement, it is important to grant that your interlocutor comes to his or her point of view in good faith.&nbsp; Or, as 2nd century Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius put in his Meditations, “to take into consideration … that no one does the wrong thing deliberately.”&nbsp; I certainly intend the same grace here and I freely admit that the critics have a point regarding the vexing ambiguity of ‘ESG’ and sustainability. But in the end, all of us share the same plight: stuck on this imperiled planet, hoping that both our ecosystems and our retirement plans suffice for the rest of our mortal lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI’m sure that even those I disagree with on this point share my hope that what we have now will survive for future generations of all our loved ones too. Based on the extensive data that I’ve personally collected and analyzed, it is clear that ESG investing is an important — albeit perhaps imperfect — tool, to help us achieve that kind of long-term sustainability.\n\n\n\nDavid HC Correll, Ph.D. is a research scientist at the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics&nbsp; (MIT CTL) and lead investigator for the State of Supply Chain Sustainability, an annual report co-presented with the Council of Supply Chain Management professionals (CSCMP).&nbsp; These opinions do not necessarily reflect the opinions of MIT CTL, CSCMP, or the report’s sponsoring companies or project staff.&nbsp;",

Lynn Worthy writes why Bobby Witt Jr. is poised to finish the season strong.\n\nWhile he didn’t go on the injured list, Witt scuffled through a hamstring injury at the end of July. \nWitt missed several games and then eased into playing time when he did return to the field, including serving as designated hitter the first two games back as well as having two days off in his first week back. \n“I’ve been just kind of working through some things and just trying to get back to just being comfortable, getting back to being myself and just go have fun, compete,” Witt said last week of his recent offensive resurgence.\n\nSalvy is day-to-day after taking a pitch off his right hand last night.\n\n\nMike Matheny says Salvador Perez has a right hand contusion and will be out day to day.TV: Bally Sports Kansas CityStream: https://t.co/SD0bdLksMW#Royals pic.twitter.com/6ix44kpfRK— Bally Sports Kansas City (@BallySportsKC) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nMLB Pipeline projects who will be each team’s top prospect next year.\nRoyals: Gavin Cross, OF (No. 1/MLB No. 75)No. 1 stays No. 1. This year’s 9th overall pick rose to the top of the Kansas City ranks shortly after signing and has brought his solid breadth of tools quickly to the pro ranks, hitting .273/.400/.584 with six homers in 21 games across the Arizona Complex League and Single-A Columbia. Some concerns about his contact rate, which were held over from the Draft, have continued in his first taste of full-season ball, but Cross’ power-speed combo and ability to play a quality center field should still keep him in KC’s top spot for the foreseeable future.\nAlex Duvall at Royals Farm Report mulls long-term deals for Royals rookies.\nOutside of Witt Jr., I think MJ has the most superstar upside of any player on this team right now. I think his framing issues were totally over blown, but even if you don’t like him as a framer, ABS is inevitable at this point and in three years MJ’s blocking and throwing ability will make him one of the most valuable catchers in baseball. I also think he’s capable of playing a fantastic right field. We know his arm will play, he’s shown flashes of making great catches in the outfield, and he’s literally been out there for less than a year. Maybe he’s Willson Contreras in five years. One of the most consistent performers in baseball behind the plate who had to play some outfield early on before becoming Chicago’s every day catcher. Maybe he’s Brian McCann.

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/amd-ryzen-6000-chromebooks-in-development/",
        "description": "Though we have quite a few options for processors in Chromebooks these days, the market is largely dominated by Intel.  Sure, there are AMD, MediaTek and Snapdragon processors out there for purchase, but between the large and small-core offerings by Intel over the years, Chromebooks and Intel silicon have become somewhat synonymous. \n\n\n\nThere&#8217;s room for other players, however, and we shouldn&#8217;t think for a second that AMD, Qualcomm and MediaTek aren&#8217;t very interested in a bigger piece of the ChromeOS pie.  While each of these chip makers have watched a handful of Chromebooks released with their silicon inside, by far the most prolific of the bunch is MediaTek.  On the back of the very-successful Lenovo Chromebook Duet, MediaTek has more presence in the ChromeOS market than most, but continuing development makes it look like AMD isn&#8217;t even close to done expanding their market share.\n\n\n\nA rocky road for AMD so far\n\n\n\nAMD showed up pretty late to the Chromebook game, and their start wasn&#8217;t great.  Included in a few low-end devices, AMD hit the scene with the A4 and A6 processors that didn&#8217;t get anyone very excited.  They were slow and didn&#8217;t really come with any big upsides versus the small-core Intel silicon already available and in multiple Chromebooks at the time.\n\n\n\nThe next move came via the Ryzen 3000 chips, bringing decent performance gains and inclusion in better Chromebooks.  Those chips had an Achilles heel, however, and really tanked performance when off the charger.  It was a bummer and something we didn&#8217;t feel comfortable recommending to our audience due to the wild shift in performance you got when moving on and off the charger.\n\n\n\nThis year, we&#8217;ve seen a few Ryzen 5000-powered Chromebooks announced, but we&#8217;ve yet to have any real time spent with any of them so far.  From what we can tell, Ryzen 5000 Chromebooks get us far closer to current-gen Intel Chromebook speeds, but not quite all the way there.  The upside to that?  Current 12th-gen Intel processors aren&#8217;t really necessary for general work and standard Chromebook tasks.  Pick up a 10th-gen Intel-powered Chromebook and you&#8217;ll quickly see that it is robust enough to get you through nearly anything you throw at it.\n\n\n\nThe Ryzen 6000\n\n\n\nEven though we&#8217;ve only seen a couple announcements for Chromebooks with the Ryzen 5000 series APUs, it looks like work is already underway to get Ryzen 6000 APUs into upcoming Chromebooks.  This comes as AMD has just recently announced the follow up to those chips in the latest Ryzen 7000 series.  We&#8217;re still a ways out from seeing any Windows devices with this latest processor inside, so we likely won&#8217;t see any mention of ChromeOS running on a Ryzen 7000 chip for quite some time.\n\n\n\nvia the Chromium Gerrit\n\n\nFor now, we&#8217;re looking at new Chromebooks in the works with the current generation Ryzen 6000 APU (code name Yellow Carp), and that could mean another big jump in performance for AMD-powered Chromebooks.   While not mind-blowing, the move to a 6nm process for these APUs from the Ryzen 5000&#8217;s 7nm process should aid in both performance an in battery life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two devices we&#8217;re currently tracking are &#8216;Skyrim&#8217; and &#8216;Morthal&#8217; and I have to confess, the earliest commits around &#8216;Skyrim&#8217; had me thinking it was related to the recently discovered Alder Lake-N Chromebooks we&#8217;re now beginning to track with regularity.  You can see in the initial commit below and see why I would think that:\n\n\n\nvia the Chromium Gerrit\n\n\n&#8216;Nissa&#8217; is the main development board that all new Alder Lake-N Chromebooks will be built off of.  This is one of the earliest mentions of &#8216;Skyrim&#8217; and they are beginning the initial overlay with a &#8216;Nissa&#8217; overlay.  While I&#8217;m still not sure what was going on in those initial phases, it has become quite clear that &#8216;Skyrim&#8217; is based on AMD silicon and, more specifically, is tied to Yellow Carp as referenced above.\n\n\n\nThis slip had me believe that the first board to emerge from &#8216;Skyrim&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;Morthal&#8217; &#8211; was also another Alder Lake-N Chromebook.  After digging a bit and finding this reference to Yellow Carp, we now know that these devices are in fact AMD Ryzen 6000-powered Chromebooks on the way with more likely to follow.\n\n\n\nThe timeline for these devices is still very much up in the air, but the move to the Ryzen 6000 chips from the Ryzen 5000 should be far less of a jump than we had in the move from the A4/A6 to Ryzen 3000, so we could see some of these Chromebooks emerge before the year is out.  My money would be on a Q1 2023 release, however, so don&#8217;t get too attached to the idea of better AMD Chromebooks if you are in the market for a new device by the holidays.\n\n\n\nWith faster CPU and GPU speeds, however, the AMD Ryzen 6000 could make for a very compelling mid-range Chromebook chip.  We&#8217;re still a bit out from the launch of Steam games for Chromebooks, but if the new AMD Ryzen 6000 gets looped into the approved chip sets for this effort, I could see quite a few users choosing AMD Chromebooks over Intel-based models if the selection is good and the price is right.  We have a bit of time before that comes to fruition, and we&#8217;ll be keeping an eye on &#8216;Skyrim&#8217; as we wait for the first of what could be many new AMD Chromebooks with the Ryzen 6000 inside.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Photo by G Fiume/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The former Rule 5 pick pitched 2.1 innings and 31 pitches for Aberdeen. O’s affiliates split the four games. Triple-A: Norfolk Tides 5, Lehigh Valley (Phillies) 3\nThe Tides scored three early runs and added two more in the seventh inning, and it’s a good thing they did, because they gave up three ninth inning runs. Trying to push reliever Ryan Watson, who’d pitched the seventh and eighth innings, for a third inning, went poorly. \nFor the prospect watchers, this was a solid win, although the prospects weren’t the ones with the big run-scoring hits. Jacob Nottingham and Kelvin Gutiérrez drove in two runs each. Colton Cowser had a hit and a walk from the leadoff spot in the lineup. He’s just 2-16 in four games since joining the Tides, but hey, it’s only four games. Faring better was Joey Ortiz, who racked up three hits, scored two runs, and drove in a run himself. Ortiz is hitting .471 through the same four games.\nBlanking the IronPigs for the first six innings was starting pitcher Matt Harvey. He scattered three hits and four walks while striking out seven, lowering his Triple-A ERA this season to 4.31. It is nice that we did not experience the version of the year 2022 where the Orioles needed his services at the MLB level.\nNorfolk box score.\nDouble-A: Erie (Tigers) 4, Bowie Baysox 3\nEvery game in this series is crucial because these two teams are fighting for the second half division title in the Eastern League Southwest. Bowie’s loss draws them back into a tie with two more head-to-head games over the next two days, plus two more weeks of games against other teams.\nBaysox batters drew the assignment of facing a Tigers first rounder from last year, CB A round pick Ty Madden, who’s been pitching great in High-A and Double-A this season. Madden struck out ten Bowie batters over a six inning start, allowing a run only when Darell Hernaiz hit a sacrifice fly. Hernaiz took an 0-3; he’s hitting .111 in four games at this level. Connor Norby and Coby Mayo had one hit apiece.\nThe O’s affiliate fell in a 3-0 hole early and eventually rallied to tie with Toby “Lawrence” Welk delivering a two-run double. That bailed out starting pitcher Garrett Stallings, who pitched the minimum quality start (six innings, three earned runs). Stallings gave up six hits, did not walk anyone, and struck out two. His 6.44 ERA for the season is unimpressive, but he’s lowered it from 10.08 at the end of June, so at least he’s got that going for him.\nBowie box score.\nHigh-A: Hickory (Rangers) 9, Aberdeen IronBirds 2\nNot much good to say about this one. Big leaguer Tyler Wells had a rehab outing, throwing 31 pitches over 2.1 innings. He struck out three batters. Wells was lifted after allowing a single in the third inning and the reliever let the run score, so it was charged to Wells.\nIn other rehab news, Grayson Rodriguez, who rehabbed for Aberdeen earlier this week, is headed up to Bowie to make his next rehab start. This is assumed to be happening on Tuesday, but that’s not guaranteed yet.\nHeston Kjerstad had the night off.\nAberdeen box score.\nLow-A: Delmarva Shorebirds 3, Fredericksburg Nationals 2\nLet’s see here... Jackson Holliday: 0-5. Dang. Dylan Beavers: 0-3. Dang, although he did draw a walk. This did not stop the Shorebirds from going on to win the game thanks to two eighth inning runs that turned a loss into a win. \nCatcher and fourth round pick Silas Ardoin was 3-4, getting half of Delmarva’s hits all by himself and driving in all three runs. Nice work, Son of Danny. Second round pick Max Wagner had two hits to make sure he was on base for both of Ardoin’s run-scoring plate appearances.\nDelmarva box score.\nSaturday’s Scheduled Games\n\nNorfolk: vs. Lehigh Valley, 6:35. Starter: Drew Rom\nBowie: at Erie, 4:05. Starter: TBD\nAberdeen: vs. Hickory, 6:05. Starter: Houston Roth\nDelmarva: at Fredericksburg, 6:05. Starter: TBD",

        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/09/paul-tears-down-myth-gauguin/671332/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "Reading Paul Gauguin’s fictionalized travelogue, Noa Noa, you’d be forgiven for thinking he’d stumbled upon an artist’s idyll when he arrived in Tahiti in 1891. “All the joys—animal and human—of a free life,” he wrote, “are mine.” Once a successful stockbroker in Paris, Gauguin told the French newspaper L’Echo de Paris before he left for Tahiti that he was rejecting the stifling “influence of civilization” to devote himself to art and pleasure. Despite his disappointment with how much French colonial rule had corrupted the island, Gauguin’s fascination with Polynesian culture and what he referred to as its “primitivism” characterizes much of his best-known work. His devotion to his artistic vision at all costs—his quest for creative paradise—has continued to intrigue us well into the 21st century. As Gauguin himself predicted, he has become more of a myth than a man.Less appealing, however, is his documented proclivity for the young girls who served as his lovers and frequent subjects of his work. In his 1892 painting Manaò tupapaú (Spirit of the Dead Watching), a nude girl lies on her front, staring up at the viewer, on display and seemingly terrified. Gauguin’s biographers commonly assert that her name was Teha’amana; she was reportedly 13 when Gauguin pursued her, eventually giving her syphilis and impregnating her. More than 100 years later, in 2017, Louis Vuitton used Delightful Land, featuring a nude girl—likely Teha’amana—as a design for a luxury-handbag collection. That same year, Gauguin’s drawings of Polynesian women and girls were animated and projected onto the facade of the Grand Palais, in Paris, beaming out to passers-by.Daisy Lafarge’s debut novel, Paul, takes a unique approach to an ongoing question: How, in the age of the #MeToo movement, should we interact with the work of men like Paul Gauguin? Superficially, Paul appears to follow in the vein of recent novels that address psychological and sexual violence––most notably Megan Nolan’s Acts of Desperation and Kate Elizabeth Russell’s My Dark Vanessa––by centering on a vulnerable young woman’s relationship with an abusive man, and extrapolating the nuances of that relationship as broader indications of modern misogyny. But Paul does something more complex: Larfarge uses the thoroughly contemporary story of a traumatized graduate on her European gap year to boldly reinterpret Gauguin’s life and legacy. By reconstructing one of the giants of the artistic canon as an irredeemable villain, the novel makes it impossible to separate the art from the artist. The titular character, Paul, an evocation of Gauguin, is so obviously reprehensible that we are forced to condemn him—and thus Gauguin himself, by extension. What, Paul asks us, is so fundamentally valuable about the artist’s work that we continue to view, sell, and celebrate it more than a century later?[Read: The literary-abuser trope is everywhere]Transposed to the 21st century, Lafarge’s Paul is the boorish, middle-aged owner of Noa Noa, a Pyrenean organic farm (named after Gauguin’s book). The narrator, Frances, a shy woman with a degree in medieval history who was fired from her job as a research assistant in Paris, finds the farm on a work-exchange website. She arrives at Noa Noa, which quickly reveals itself to be more of a commune than a place of work. Soon Paul is asking that she come to bed, and over time, his treatment of her worsens into psychological and sexual manipulation. The situation drives an already fragile Frances to the point of involuntary muteness, a silence that recalls Gauguin’s voiceless, painted subjects. Like his namesake, Paul has spent significant time in Tahiti, where he claims to have found true artistic liberty. Paul also used the people of Tahiti as muses—photographing where Gauguin painted—and sees the country as nothing more than the exotic backdrop for his journey of self-discovery. And the book implies that, like Gauguin, Paul had sexual relationships with young girls, which he excuses on the basis of a “cultural difference” in Tahiti that permitted him to engage in child exploitation without consequences.Where Paul does diverge from reality is in its purposeful refusal to explain away his behavior on the basis of brilliance. Lafarge denies Paul the defense of artistic value that so often absolves toxic creative types. Her Paul is not a brilliant artist; he is pathetic, failing. But though his behavior might immediately repulse readers, Frances is so desperate for guidance and security that she takes much longer to come to terms with who he really is. That slow process of realization guides the novel and is often staged in scenes of observation, drawing a parallel with the act of viewing a work of art.In one passage near the end of the book, Frances watches Paul stare lustfully at a group of preteen girls. Later, faced with inarguable proof of his predatory pedophilia, she shatters. “It is so hard to look,” she thinks to herself. “So hard to look away.” Within that question––to look, or to look away?—Paul asks us to consider what we’re really seeing in paintings like Spirit of the Dead Watching. Frances’s discomfort becomes our own, blurring fiction and fact until it is impossible to think of Gauguin without the ugly specter of Paul.\r\nSpirit of the Dead Watching, 1892 (Francis G. Mayer / Corbis Historical / Getty)\r\nWithin the novel, censuring both men might be an obvious reflex, but in the real world, it’s much more fraught. “The person, I can totally abhor and loathe, but the work is the work,” Vicente Todolí, a former director of Tate Modern, has said of Gauguin. Viewers might ask: What harm can it possibly do to look at a painting when the subject and artist are both long dead? But the decision to exhibit Gauguin’s art is a conscious choice—and museums, of late, have decided to lay bare the artist’s behavior. So is the decision to consume his work. Lafarge, through Frances’s struggle to truly see Paul as he is, positions the act of witnessing—so often characterized as passive—as an act of complicity. Her inaction in the face of Paul’s behavior appears almost like acceptance, allowing Paul to continue deluding himself that he is “a good man.” Faced with Gauguin’s work, you are asked to make a calculation: Is the pleasure of observing it worth the pain of its production?[Read: An era for women artists?]As the novel comes to a close, Paul takes Frances on an impromptu road trip to visit a series of his friends, most of whom appear ambivalent about him. “If I were a woman,” one man remarks to her, “I’d keep my distance.” In another scene, Paul pressures Frances to perform oral sex on him in a child’s bed, which palpably unnerves her. Growing ever more suspicious of Paul, Frances finally confronts him about his time in Tahiti. Predictably, he begins to weep. “I am not a bad man,” he says, begging for understanding. But Frances refuses. Instead, as they’re driving back to Noa Noa, she jumps out of his car and buys a ticket to Paris.It’s not entirely satisfying as a resolution––Paul receives no meaningful comeuppance. Wisely, though, Lafarge leaves the central question of the novel open. Should we look, or should we look away? In Frances’s escape, Lafarge seems to land on the latter option. But there is another possibility, I think.Earlier this year, the Alte Nationalgalerie, in Berlin, exhibited a series of Gauguin’s paintings juxtaposed against the work of artists attempting to reckon with his legacy. In one room, Gauguin’s paintings and etchings were positioned opposite a work of live-action video art by Rosalind Nashashibi and Lucy Skaer, titled Why Are You Angry?, which was created in response to Gauguin’s No te aha oe riri. Dressed in the same clothes and posed in the same positions as the subjects of that painting, the girls in the video stared at you when you passed by. You could see their bodies shifting, their breathing, their human twitches. The line between person and figure blurred; you were unable to consider the master brushwork of Gauguin’s paintings without being aware of the eyes of the girls upon your back. You turned around. Time passed. They were still looking at you, answering your gaze with their own.",

President Trump criticized his former Attorney General William Barr on Friday, calling him a “weak and pathetic RINO” after Barr defended the Justice Department (DOJ) in its search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home for classified documents. \n\n\n\n“Bill Barr had ‘no guts,’ and got ‘no glory,’ Trump said on his&nbsp;Truth Social platform. “He was a weak and pathetic RINO, who was so afraid of being Impeached that he became a captive to the Radical Left Democrats.”\n\n\n\nThe former attorney general told Fox News on Friday that the DOJ likely has&nbsp;“pretty good evidence”&nbsp;to have gone this far into its investigation of Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents.\n\n\n\nBarr also said he could not think of a “legitimate reason” for Trump to have removed classified documents to his Mar-a-Lago residence.\n\n\n\nThe FBI executed a search warrant of Trump’s Florida home in early August, recovering dozens of what the Justice Department says are classified documents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNewly unsealed documents&nbsp;on Friday also revealed that the FBI found 43 empty folders with classified banners and 28 empty folders labeled “return to staff secretary/military aide.” The records were unsealed on Friday by a judge that is reviewing the former president's request to have a third-party special master review the evidence obtained. \n\n\n\nIn his social media post, the former president also repeated accusations that Barr did not sufficiently fight for \"election integrity.\" \n\n\n\nTrump has consistently made claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Barr was among several federal and state officials that said there was no substantial evidence of widespread voter fraud following President Biden's 2020 win. \n\n\n\n“Barr never fought the way he should have for Election Integrity, and so much else,” Trump added in his Truth Social post. “He started off OK as A.G., but faded fast - Didn’t have courage or stamina. People like that will never Make America Great Again!”",

Without knowing how good the build quality will be or how intuitive and useful the software experience will be, it&#8217;s tough to decide whether or not $399 is a good price for the new watch from Google, but we all feel like there&#8217;s a good chance it will be.\n\n\n\nWe also discuss the recent patent published for the Pixel Notepad &#8211; Google&#8217;s long-rumored folding phone.  While the patent doesn&#8217;t really tell us anything new, it solidifies the fact that the Pixel Notepad is on the way and gives us a bit of assurance in the earlier leaks and rumors regarding it&#8217;s size and form factor.  \n\n\n\nFinally, we discuss the excellent Acer Chromebook Spin 714 and how this Chromebook took the beloved Spin 713 formula and boldly changed things like the screen size and aspect ratio while at the same time adding more-premium pieces to craft a really fantastic Chromebook. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Fresh Roasted Coffee. &#xA0;To check it out, go to https://chromeunboxed.com/coffee/ and use the discount code CHROMEUNBOXED for 15% off your initial purchase!\n\n\n\nThis episode is also brought to you by NordVPN.

Well, except for maybe the Dodgers who are so far out in front it no longer matters - to the point their presence on the list is a token nod to wrapping up the #1 overall seed regardless of what happens.\nAustin Meadows to Miss Rest of Season Due to Mental HealthDetroit’s Austin Meadows will be missing the rest of the season due to issues with mental health. In what is still too rare an occurrence in professional sports, the Tigers’ outfielder came forward to shine a light on the issue of mental health struggles.\n\n\npic.twitter.com/LyO56HxQa3— Austin Meadows (@austin_meadows) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nAt 30, Machado Best He Has Ever BeenAt only 30 years of age, Machado is now the veteran “old-timer” with 10 seasons under his belt complete with the the knowledge and savvy that comes from such experience.",

        "description": "Remains from Chad desert provoke rancorous dispute over whether species was earliest to walk uprightIt is a dispute that has taken a long time to reach boiling point. Seven million years after an apelike creature – since nicknamed Toumaï – traversed the landscape of modern Chad, its means of mobility has triggered a dispute among fossil experts. Some claim this was the oldest member of the human lineage. Others that it was just an old ape.The row, kindled by a paper in Nature, last week led scientists to denounce opponents while others accused rivals of building theories on “less than five minutes’ observation” .

        "description": "(Needle Pin)The English folk singer considers life’s landmarks, from childhood to dementia, on her affecting eighth albumThe artwork of folk singer and fiddle player Jackie Oates’s eighth album depicts the harpy from Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials saga who resides in the land of death, listening to the stories of the deceased; what ancient Greece termed a “psychopomp”. Pullman’s creation chimes with Oates’s current studies at an Oxford hospice to become a music psychotherapist, singing to the terminally ill. Having lost her father a few years back (an event addressed on her last album), Oates is now facing her mother’s dementia. This inspires one strand of Gracious Wings, notably on a touching cover of Tom Waits’s Time, though mortality is never far off in traditional folk song, as attested by versions of maritime ballad The Ship in Distress and the grieving Lament to the Moon.The album captures a variety of moods, however. Robin Tells of Winter is sparse and forlorn as a January dawn, while Tammy Toddles celebrates childhood innocence and La Llorona, a duet with Megan Henwood, addresses pregnancy. As ever, Oates’s vocals are light but mellifluous and she remains an expressive fiddler, given classy support from bassist John Parker and accordion player John Spiers, among others.

        "description": "Photo by Peter Joneleit/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Lewis has 23 HR in 2022 Friday’s trip around the Dodgers minor league affiliates included a split doubleheader, a pair of one-run games and a big comeback win.\nPlayer of the day\nBrandon Lewis played both ends of the doubleheader for Tulsa on Friday and he had a big day at the plate. The big first baseman was a combined 5-for-7 with three home runs to drive in a total of seven runs.\n\n\nBlue jersey, white jersey ... it doesn't matter for Brandon Lewis.The @Dodgers prospect hits THREE homers in a doubleheader for the @TulsaDrillers! pic.twitter.com/42hrBRKiOQ— Minor League Baseball (@MiLB) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nThe trio of long balls gives Lewis a total of 22 on the season after hitting 30 between two levels in 2021. Hitting two home runs in the second game gave him his second multi-homer effort of the year and seventh in his career.\nTriple-A Oklahoma City\nDown 2-0 early in Friday night’s contest, Oklahoma City scored a run in each of the sixth and ninth innings to tie the game. But Davis Wendzel took Justin Bruihl deep in the home half of the ninth for Round Rock (Rangers), sending OKC to a 3-2 loss.\nThe Dodgers had just five baserunners all night, with three hits and two walks. It wasn’t until James Outman walked to leadoff the fifth that OKC even reached base. But Outman would be erased on a double play.\nJacob Amaya tripled to start the sixth and would come around to score on a Drew Avans single to cut the deficit to 2-1 heading into the later innings. Michael Busch hit his 28th homer of the season (17th with OKC) to tie the game in the ninth.\n\n\nThis Michael Busch home run got out in a hurry!The No. 4 @Dodgers prospect lines his 28th jack of the year to tie the game in the 9th for the @okc_dodgers. pic.twitter.com/Hx5LnSbFJl— MLB Pipeline (@MLBPipeline) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nDouble-A Tulsa\nDue to a rainout Thursday night, Tulsa and Northwest Arkansas (Royals) played a doubleheader Friday night. The Naturals took a 5-3 win in the first game while the Drillers came back and put it on them for a 12-1 win in the second game.\nTulsa got behind 4-0 heading into the bottom of the third in the first game and barely mounted an attempt to come back. Leonel tripled in a run and came around to score on a ground out to cut the deficit in half but after trading runs in the fourth, neither team scored again the rest of the way.\nIt was a different story in the second game as the Drillers came out firing on all cylinders from the outset. They sent eight men to the plate in the first, scoring four total on a Kody Hoese RBI-single and the three-run blast from Lewis.\nTulsa kept the offense moving in the third when they scored six runs while all nine hitters in their lineup had a plate appearance. Lewis hit a two-run shot, Kenneth Betancourt doubled in a run and Valera crushed a home run of the three-run variety to push the lead to 10-0.\n\n\nLeonel Valera is goin' YARD with this 3 run homer! Drillers lead 10-0 ⬇️ 3 pic.twitter.com/OfUoKBEEe6— Tulsa Drillers (@TulsaDrillers) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nValera had a big night with the bat, finishing a combined 4-for-7 with a walk to go with the triple, home run and two singles. The shortstop would drive in a total of four runs and scored three.\nLandon Knack started the second game and struck out six over three scoreless, giving up just three hits and two walks while keeping the Naturals off the board.\nHigh-A Great Lakes\nFour different pitchers combined to keep Lake County (Guardians) off the board to make a seventh inning solo homer off the bat of Eddys Leonard hold up in a 1-0 victory for Great Lakes.\n\n\nEddys Leonard hit home run #15 of the year and his 6th of 2022. Leonard is hitting .267 on the year with an OPS Of .781. #dodgers pic.twitter.com/ux46NBeZKp— Dodger Poke Report (@dodger_poke) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Loons didn’t have a baserunner until the fourth inning when Jorbit Vivas walked with two outs. But Vivas was picked off to keep the minimum until the sixth when Austin Gauthier singled to start the inning. Damon Keith singled three batters later and Gauthier was erased trying to go first to third to end the inning.\nThe Captains had a runner on in every inning except one, thanks in large part to three Loons’ errors. But they weren’t able to take advantage of the eight at-bats they had with a runner in scoring position all night.\nBen Casparius was the bulk guy for Great Lakes and he struck out five over four scoreless innings, scattering three hits and a pair of walks.\nLow-A Rancho Cucamonga\nDown by three runs late Friday, Rancho scored six runs in the final two innings to secure an 8-5 victory over Inland Empire (Angels). The two clubs have split the four games in the series, leaving the Quakes five games behind the 66ers in the standings with eight games to go.\nDalton Rushing hit a two-run homer in the first inning off rehabbing big leaguer Michael Lorenzen to give the Quakes an early advantage. But Inland Empire quickly erased that with three runs of their own.\n\n\nDalton Rushing hit his 7th home run since joining Rancho on August 1st. He also had 3 RBIs in the game which puts him at 25 so far with the Quakes. He's hitting .438 and with an OPS of 1.285. #dodgers pic.twitter.com/qsb0JsZwkN— Dodger Poke Report (@dodger_poke) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nLorenzen didn’t allow a run the rest of his night, exiting after six innings with his team up by a score of 5-2. That’s when the bats came alive for the visitors.\nRancho scored two in the eighth inning, including a Taylor Young solo home run to bring the Quakes within a run heading to the ninth.\nYeiner Fernandez and Griffin Lockwood-Powell laid the foundation for the big inning with a pair of singles to start the inning. From there, the Quakes took the lead without the benefit of another hit.\nJake Vogel walked to load the bases, Alex Freeland was hit by a pitch to bring in the tying run, followed by back-to-back walks for Rushing and Nick Biddison to score two more. Bubba Alleyne grounded into a force out to bring the fourth and final run home and Carlos De Los Santos shut the door in the bottom half of the ninth to earn his fifth victory (5-0) of the year.\nTransactions\nTriple-A: Oklahoma City Dodgers activated RHP Keone Kela from the reserve list.\nLow-A: Rancho Cucamonga Quakes placed SS Sean McLain on the 7-day injured list. SS Alex Freeland and RHP Livan Reinoso assigned to Rancho Cucamonga Quakes from ACL Dodgers.\nFriday scores\n\nRound Rock 3, Oklahoma City 2\nNorthwest Arkansas 5, Tulsa 3 (Game 1)\nTulsa 12, Northwest Arkansas 1 (Game 2)\nGreat Lakes 1, Lake County 0\nRancho Cucamonga 8, Inland Empire 5\n\nSaturday Schedule\n\n4:05 p.m. PT: Great Lakes (Ronan Kopp) vs. Lake County (Aaron Davenport)\n4:35 p.m.: Oklahoma City (Jon Duplantier) at Round Rock (Kolby Allard)\n5:05 p.m. PT: Tulsa (Lael Lockhart) vs. Northwest Arkansas (Jonathan Bowlan)\n7:05 p.m.: Rancho Cucamonga (Maddux Bruns) at Inland Empire (Jose Soriano)",

        "description": "Photo by John Fisher/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Cubs blanked by Cardinals, 8-0 In a season where the Cubs are heading toward 90-plus losses, they’ve largely had a lot of fight in them. Even with the season waning, that’s still been the case more nights than not. I’m not going to say that the Cubs didn’t fight Friday night. But they didn’t put up much of a fight. I don’t doubt they’ll bounce back before this weekend is over and give the Cardinals some headaches. \nOne of the big reasons that the Cubs came up empty on Friday? Jordan Montgomery. We covered that pretty in depth the last time these two teams met when Jordan one-hit the Cubs. He wasn’t quite as dominant in the sequel. But he did throw six scoreless innings. That improves his career record to 4-0 in four starts against the Cubs with an 0.63 ERA. He’s held the Cubs to a .407 OPS in those games. Flat out domination. If Montgomery is going to be taking up residence in St. Louis, the Cubs are going to have figure him out. \nThe Cubs did put up seven hits and drew two walks, but they just couldn’t push any across. On the other side of the ledger, the Cubs used three pitchers and all of them allowed one or more runs. This was the kind of clunker that can happen when the reality is that you are just playing out the string and you are a bit overmatched on a given night. \nWe’re not going to dwell on this one too much, so let’s get to the three positive performances I’ve identified from Friday’s loss. \n1 and 2: Nick Madrigal and Seiya Suzuki each had a pair of hits at the top of the lineup. That kind of performance is usually going to lead to runs, but not so much on Friday. \n3: With not a lot to go with, I’ll take humor in the night of Yan Gomes. One hit in four at bats. Fairly pedestrian. But, he was credited with a stolen base. In a career that now has over 3,500 plate appearances, that was theft number six. \nNow we turn our attention to the Heroes and Goats from Friday’s loss. \nGame 132, September 2: Cardinals 8, Cubs 0 (56-76)\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs\n  \nReminder: Heroes and Goats are determined by WPA scores and are in no way subjective.\nTHREE HEROES:\n\n\nSuperhero: Yan Gomes (.071). 1-4, SB\n\nHero: Nick Madrigal (.021). 2-4, K\n\nSidekick: Seiya Suzuki (.020). 2-4, K\n\nTHREE GOATS:\n\n\nBilly Goat: Ian Happ (-.246). 0-4, K, DP\n\nGoat: Nico Hoerner (-.088). 0-4, K\n\nKid: Franmil Reyes (-.079). 0-3, BB, K\n\nWPA Play of the Game: With two outs in the first inning, Adrian Sampson faced Tyler O’Neill with runners on second and third. O’Neill singled and drove in the only two runs the Cardinals ended up needing. (.170)\n*Cubs Play of the Game: It was only 3-0 in the seventh when Yan Gomes faced Jordan Montgomery with a runner on first. Gomes singled and brought the tying run to the plate with no outs. (.103)\n\nRizzo Award Cumulative Standings: (Top 5/Bottom 5)\nThe award is named for Anthony Rizzo, who finished first in this category three of the first four years it was in existence and four times overall. He also recorded the highest season total ever at +65.5. The point scale is three points for a Superhero down to negative three points for a Billy Goat.\n\nDavid Robertson +22.5\nNico Hoerner +17.5\nScott Effross +17\nChristopher Morel +15\nPatrick Wisdom +13.5\nDaniel Norris/Frank Schwindel/Rowan Wick -9.5\nYan Gomes -12\nJason Heyward -15.5\nRafael Ortega -16.5\n\nUp Next: Game two of the three-game set Saturday in St. Louis. Drew Smyly (5-7, 3.24) has had a very strong season, when healthy, for the Cubs. I’d certainly like for Smyly to get another season with the team as this team transitions to more of a contender. Smyly seems like just the right kind of guy to be a part of that transition. \nAdam Wainwright (9-9, 3.09) starts for the Cardinals. This will be the 48th career start for Adam against the Cubs (along with nine relief appearances). Adam is 18-14 with a 3.78 ERA over 297⅓ innings.",

Seven million years after an apelike creature – since nicknamed Toumaï – traversed the landscape of modern Chad, its means of mobility has triggered a dispute among fossil experts. Some claim this was the oldest member of the human lineage. Others that it was just an old ape.The row, kindled by a paper in Nature, last week led scientists to denounce opponents while others accused rivals of building theories on “less than five minutes’ observation” .

        "description": "Hillary Clinton recently hawked a line of hats with a mocking logo — \"But her emails.\" The taunt was directed at Donald Trump, who faces a real possibility of a criminal charge after the FBI’s search of his Mar-a-Lago residence.\n\n\n\nWhile Clinton considers her prior conduct a subject of mirth, the FBI’s handling of her case will cast a long shadow over any potential prosecution of the former president, including the recent focus on an obstruction charge. There likely would be an assortment of \"but her emails\" objections to a charge that could have been made as readily against Clinton or her associates.\n\n\n\nThe appointment of a special master to examine materials seized in the Trump investigation has occupied much of the attention in the past week. Trump’s legal team’s belated request for a special master could help bring greater clarity to the raid’s scope and seizures. Yet it will not likely alter the trajectory of the case, which the Department of Justice (DOJ) has repeatedly stressed is an \"active criminal investigation.\"\n\n\n\nWhat is notable is the government's obvious effort to focus public attention on obstruction as a potential crime. Emphasizing obstruction, instead of the improper retention of classified material, could be seen as a way to navigate a political minefield to get to a prosecution. The reason, once again, is Hillary Clinton, who remains a complicating factor in Attorney General Merrick Garland showing the public that this is not about pursuing Trump but enforcing the law.\n\n\n\nIn its filings in the last two weeks, the most worrisome line for Trump came in the DOJ’s&nbsp;36-page opposition&nbsp;to a special master’s appointment when it declared that \"obstructive conduct occurred\" at Mar-a-Lago in the&nbsp;months leading up to the Aug. 8 search.&nbsp;The DOJ also said it \"has developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government’s investigation.”\n\n\n\nThose types of statements never bode well for a target, since they reflect a certain commitment to the prosecutorial path.\n\n\n\nThe value of shifting toward an obstruction case is that it would reduce the complications of any Trump claims on declassification or executive privilege to remove documents while he remained president. (The three cited statutes do not require classified status for a crime but two deal with the unlawful possession or handling of defense or sensitive information.) Trump has not fully explained how he allegedly declassified all of this material. Under Section 1519, the government can prosecute someone who “knowingly conceals any document with the intent to obstruct” their investigation.\n\n\n\nThe filings do not indicate that the government has evidence of knowing concealment by Trump, but it cited various representations made by lawyers on his behalf.\n\n\n\nTrump might be familiar with such cases because he pardoned Jesse Benton in the final days of his administration. Benton, who managed Ron Paul’s 2012 presidential campaign, was convicted of violating Section 1519 by concealing campaign payments from the Federal Election Commission. Ironically, Trump signed that pardon as his staff was preparing to leave the White House, including having these boxes packed for transport to Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\nWhile the released evidence would clearly support a charge of obstruction, it is unclear what acts were knowingly taken and by whom.\n\n\n\nA criminal charge of obstruction against Trump would offer certain political benefits for Garland.&nbsp;As previously discussed, the government has routinely elected not to prosecute high-ranking officials for improperly removing classified material or has sought mere misdemeanor charges in the most egregious cases.\n\n\n\nProsecuting Trump for a misdemeanor for possessing or removing classified documents would seem gratuitous, while prosecuting him for a felony would raise questions of biased or selective prosecution. After all, in 2016, Hillary Clinton had not just 113 documents containing classified material but some documents \"classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level\" on her private email servers. (In Trump’s case, the government allegedly found roughly 100 documents in the Mar-a-Lago raid in addition to roughly 150 handled over by the Trump team under an earlier subpoena.)\n\n\n\nClinton’s documents were even more vulnerable to being compromised via her unclassified email account and, according to the FBI, \"hostile actors gained access\" to some of the information. Yet she was never subjected to a raid, let alone a charge.\n\n\n\nYet,&nbsp;while&nbsp;less glaring as a contradiction than the charges on the possession or handling of classified information, an obstruction charge would allow up to a 20-year sentence and could be brought with misdemeanor charges on the mishandling or retention of classified information.\n\n\n\nThus, an obstruction charge against Trump would be prosecuted in the shadow of Hillary Clinton’s case. In addition to the transfer of top-secret and other classified documents to her private server, Clinton and her staff did not fully cooperate with investigators. During the investigations of her conduct, some of us&nbsp;marveled at the temerity of the Clinton staff&nbsp;in refusing to turn over her laptop and other evidence to State Department and DOJ investigators. The FBI had to&nbsp;cut deals with her aides&nbsp;to secure their cooperation.\n\n\n\nLater,&nbsp;more classified material was found&nbsp;on the laptop of former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), who was married to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin — 49,000 emails potentially relevant to the Clinton investigation.\n\n\n\nAfter Congress sought these emails, Clinton's staff&nbsp;unilaterally destroyed thousands of emails&nbsp;with BleachBit. Clinton was aware that Congress and the State Department were&nbsp;seeking the emails in 2014. Her lawyers turned over about 30,000 work-related emails to the State Department and deleted 33,000 others while insisting they unilaterally deemed them \"personal.\"\n\n\n\nGarland may be able to make a case against Trump and show that it is indeed distinguishable from the Clinton case and others. What has been alleged is undeniably serious, including the alleged failure to comply with an earlier subpoena and false statements. However, Garland must address the legitimate concerns of millions of Americans that the same office involved in past Trump investigations — with documented instances of false or misleading statements — is leading this new effort. There also is the great concern over the Biden administration charging a prior and possibly future political opponent.\n\n\n\nAny criminal case should be based not only on unassailable legal theories and facts but on clear consistency with past cases.&nbsp;That case will turn on still undisclosed evidence of what was known about the contents of the boxes found at Mar-a-Lago and how the documents were handled after the Trump team learned of the FBI’s investigation.\n\n\n\nWith Hillary Clinton&nbsp;selling \"But Her Emails\" hats&nbsp;at $30 a pop, Merrick Garland will have to explain the prospect of one politician going to jail while the other goes retail.\n\n\n\nJonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University.&nbsp;Follow him on Twitter&nbsp;@JonathanTurley.",

Yet Louis Armstrong was so focused on how history would judge him that he sought to preserve his own story for posterity by taping his recollections, including about the prejudice he suffered over the colour of his skin.Now the makers of a major documentary on the celebrated musician, nicknamed Satchmo or Pops, have been given unprecedented access to that archive, which includes thousands of hours of previously unheard audio recordings.

In fact, the film sometimes feels something like Russell T Davies with some Prisoner Cell Block H thrown in. But it’s certainly forthright, with some soap-operatic force.In the style of other Maggie-era Britfilms of the moment, characters seem to start their day listening intently to prim-voiced BBC radio newsreaders regaling them with the latest Thatcherite travesty, and connoisseurs of the time might groan or cringe at the TV clip Oakley uses here of Tory peer and historian Lord Beloff, banging on in the upper house about the utter superiority of the heterosexual family unit.

Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said rape victims in the state can prevent pregnancies by using emergency contraception pills such as Plan B,&nbsp;The Dallas Morning News&nbsp;reported Friday.\n\n\n\nIn Texas, abortions are banned and do not include exceptions for rape or incest. \n\n\n\nLate last month, a so-called \"trigger law\" went into effect following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade earlier this year. The trigger law makes it a felony to perform an abortion in the state with narrow exceptions when the pregnant person's life is at risk. \n\n\n\n“We want to support those victims, but also those victims can access health care immediately, as well as to report it,” Abbott told The Dallas Morning News and KXAS-TV’s “Lone Star Politics” in a segment obtained by the Morning News that will air on Sunday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“By accessing health care immediately, they can get the Plan B pill that can prevent a pregnancy from occurring in the first place,” he added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPlan B is an oral contraceptive that is taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex or a \"contraceptive accident\" to prevent pregnancy, according to the product's website. The pill prevents an egg from being released from the ovary  to prohibit fertilization. \n\n\n\nThe Republican governor also told “Lone Star Politics” that reporting a rape to law enforcement “will ensure that the rapist will be arrested and prosecuted.”\n\n\n\nHowever, very few rape cases result in an arrest. While there were 13,327 reported rapes in Texas in 2020, there were only 1,828 arrests for rape, according to the&nbsp;state’s department of public safety.\n\n\n\nAbbott’s Democratic opponent Beto O’Rourke responded to the governor’s statement on&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;on Friday night, saying “We are going to end Greg Abbott’s career on November 8 and the women of Texas are going to lead the way.”",

        "description": "The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection is dropping its subpoena of the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the software vendor Salesforce for information related to fundraising emails the party sent ahead of the attack, multiple media outlets reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post first reported on Friday that counsel for the RNC and Salesforce were notified this week that the committee is withdrawing the subpoena, deeming the information not necessary anymore at this stage of the investigation. \n\n\n\n“Given the current stage of its investigation, the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol has determined that it no longer has a need to pursue the specific information requested in the February 23, 2022 subpoena that it issued to Salesforce,” Douglas Letter, the House general counsel, wrote in an email to the RNC and Salesforce, according to the Post.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSalesforce owns the platform that the RNC uses to fundraise.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe House committee subpoenaed Salesforce for information related to RNC fundraising efforts in February, saying the committee and the Trump campaign solicited donations with unfounded claims that the 2020 presidential election was tainted by massive voter fraud. A Jan. 6 committee spokesperson said in March that the committee wanted to investigate the impact of false messages in the weeks leading up to the Capitol attack and where donations were directed.\n\n\n\nThe RNC filed a lawsuit to quash the subpoena in March, saying that it violated the First Amendment and Fourth Amendment to the Constitution and did not “advance a legislative purpose.” A federal judge rejected the lawsuit in May, saying that it did not violate the RNC’s constitutional rights and that the select committee’s interest in obtaining the information outweighed any burden placed on the RNC. \n\n\n\nBut an appeals court temporarily blocked the committee from obtaining the records later that month while the RNC challenged the subpoena. \n\n\n\nThe decision comes as the select committee is expected to resume its public hearings on the insurrection later this month following a break.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe select committee and RNC did not immediately return requests from The Hill for comment. A spokesperson for Salesforce declined to comment.",

        "description": "Dave Nelson-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  It seems to be paying dividends, as well. The Royals’ broadcast over the past few weeks has been raving about the team’s newest approach to hitting baseballs. And well they might! In a variety of small sample sizes, the team has nine different players, either active or on the IL - and most of them rookies, hitting at least league average according to the wRC+ stat. Five of them have a walk rate of 10% or above, with Nick Pratto coming in just outside the range with a 9.9% walk rate. Despite the stretches the Royals have gone through where they had difficulty scoring any runs, the future seems very bright for the Royals’ hitters.\nIt seems much of this good news stems from a new systemic approach to hitting brought on by Alec Zumwalt, Mike Tosar, and others. As the broadcast recently described it, the Royals are focused on looking for pitches with which to do damage and taking everything else. This actually makes a ton of sense and seems very different from whatever approach the team was using before. \nBased on broadcast snippets, I think it’s reasonable to say that the approach used to be more along the lines of, “Don’t swing at balls you can’t hit.” This might sound very similar to the above approach, but it is actually quite different. For example, a hitter faced with a 1-1 count would still only swing at a pitch they thought they could serious damage to in the new approach; in the old approach, a hitter would simply swing as long as they identified the pitch as a strike or close enough to the strike zone. The Royals hitters, even during the good years of ‘13-’15, were known as free-swingers who didn’t strike out much but also never walked and didn’t necessarily hit the ball with authority. The 2014 Royals famously had the fewest home runs in baseball that season, and no individual hit so many as 20, with Alex Gordon’s 19 bombs leading the team.\nThis new approach, however, is paying dividends both in more walks and in harder-hit balls. It isn’t punishing them overly much in strikeouts, either, as they’re still an above-average team in that category thanks to players like Nicky Lopez and Vinnie Pasquantino who both seem absolutely allergic to striking out.\nSpeaking of Pasquantino, the broadcast described his personal approach at the plate during a game last month. They indicated that he viewed the first two strikes as “his” and the last strike as the “team’s.” This is another way of describing the team’s approach, I think. Until a player has two strikes, they should focus on a particular pitch and/or area and if the pitch isn’t there, let it go. Once you have two strikes, of course, you have to be more willing to take whatever you can get and hope to get a bit lucky lest you completely give up any hope of winning the at-bat with a strikeout.\nIn a recent release of the video game MLB The Show they implemented a mechanic which allowed a player to guess where and what kind of pitch would be thrown. If you guessed right, the game would make it easier to hit the ball and easier to hit it harder. If you guessed wrong, the opposite would occur. It makes sense to expect this to happen in real life, where players have fractions of a second to decide whether to swing at a pitch or not. Those circumstances also make it a high-reward endeavor to only swing at the pitch you really, really want until you don’t have any choice. Aggressively seeking only certain pitches in only certain areas also makes a hitter faster and more efficient. When you’re dealing with major league pitches, even hundredths of a second shaved off your pitch identification and swing decision processes can be the difference between a whiff and a home run.\nWhen Alec Zumwalt was first named hitting coach it was made clear that this may not be a long stop for him. However, even if he moves on the Royals need to make sure that the next major league hitting coach - and every hitting coach in the organization - buys into this philosophy. It has already paid huge dividends and the Royals need to take every advantage they can get.",

        "link": "https://www.denverpost.com/2022/09/03/nolan-arenado-cardinals-rockies-truth/",
        "description": "I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot lately about the greatness of Nolan Arenado.\nGiven his nightly Gold Glove work at third base and his MVP-caliber season, he&#8217;s a hard man to escape if you love baseball.\nBut here&#8217;s the thing. There are people within the Rockies organization whom I know and respect who still resent Arenado for forcing the Rockies to trade him to St. Louis in February 2021.\nTheir thinking, essentially, is that Arenado turned his back on the Rockies after signing an eight-year, $260 million contract before the 2019 season. A lot of hard-core Rockies fans that I know resent Arenado, too. They consider him a spoiled brat and a traitor.\nI&#8217;m old school and I believe in loyalty, too, but the truth is, Arenado was too good for the Rockies. He saw the writing on the wall. I don&#8217;t blame him for escaping Colorado and striving for more than mediocrity. He wants to play deep into October, he wants to slip on a World Series ring.\nArenado&#8217;s talent, desire, passion, and will to win were not matched by the franchise or owner Dick Monfort.\n&#8220;If I had my druthers, I would rather have Nolan Arenado, but it was Nolan’s choice,&#8221; Monfort said during that painful news conference following the trade. &#8220;He wanted to move on. I’ve speculated over the last year why, and I’ve talked to Nolan a lot about it over the last year. But the fact remains that I think he just felt it was time for him to try something else out.&#8221;\nNo, the fact remains that Arenado didn&#8217;t believe the Rockies were truly committed to winning.\nThe Rockies had a future Hall of Fame superstar at third base but they didn&#8217;t build around him. That was apparent in 2018 when they let DJ LeMahieu walk away and didn&#8217;t make any major acquisitions after the team nearly won its first National League West title. It became even more apparent during an ugly 2019 season when the Rockies went 71-91.\nThrow in former general manager Jeff Bridich&#8217;s abrasive personality and it&#8217;s not difficult to see why Arenado forced his way out.\nThese thoughts danced through my mind &#8212; again &#8212; on Friday night as the Rockies dropped another road game, this time a 3-2 walk-off loss to lowly Cincinnati. The Rockies are on pace to finish 68-94, and with 16 of their final 29 games on the road, it could get uglier.\nAlso on Friday, Arenado was named the National League player of the month for August. It was the fourth time in his career that he&#8217;s won player of the month.\nIn the thick of the Cardinals&#8217; quest for a National League Central title, he opened the month by homering in six of his first 10 games. He finished the month hitting .365  with nine homers, 12 doubles, 29 RBIs and a 1.139 OPS over 27 games.\nAnd check this out: Arenado is the first Cardinals player to win multiple player-of-the-month awards in a single season since Albert Pujols in 2009.\nSt. Louis teammate Paul Goldschmidt will likely win the NL MVP this season, but Arenado will be a worthy runner-up.\nImagine if Arenado had toughed it out in Colorado. Would the Rockies have become a World Series contender? No. Would Arenado be in the running as the best third baseman of all time? I don&#8217;t think so.\nArenado was no saint in Colorado. He was not the kind of leader Bridich wanted him to be. He was so obsessed with baseball that he could be an island unto himself.\nBut those Rockies teammates, such as Charlie Blackmon, Trevor Story and LeMahieu, who share Arenado&#8217;s passion for the game, understand his obsessive nature and admire his burning desire to win, know he did the right thing.",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Yankees have not played well for a while, but the strength of schedule for the other AL East teams could give them a less stressful road. The New York Yankees are heading into the season’s last month in dire straits. After losing two series against the Athletics and Angels, they need big wins against some division rivals to win the AL East and get a first-round bye. However, many are not convinced that they can do that. Considering the rhetoric from a particular manager about a certain Yankees shortstop and high-ranking prospect, I don’t blame anyone!\nAaron Judge is lighting up the statistical leaderboards, and the pitching has been good, especially the bullpen. However, it’s nail-biting time with a division lead dwindling and the regular season closing due to bad errors and poor performances at the plate from players who should be producing. The strength of schedule (SOS) for inter-divisional opponents is of the utmost importance in this race. So, where do the Yankees sit compared to their AL East counterparts? \nWith 30 games left in the season after another brutal blow on Friday, the Yankees sit 14th among all teams in SOS at .505 per the Tankathon website. Their most challenging opponents are the Rays (five games), Blue Jays (three games), Brewers (three games), and Orioles (three games). Other series against the Rangers, Pirates, and Red Sox are sprinkled throughout the rest of the season, and given their recent stretch of play; there is certainly cause for concern with those as well. Boston’s rough year in particular has not spilled over into its rivalry matchups with New York, as they’re essentially at a dead heat through 13 games (7-6, Yankees).\nIf there’s one thing for the Yankees to take out of this, it’s that they have the weakest schedule* of all five AL East teams. The closest team to them in this stat is the Orioles at .510, and they are more fighting for a Wild Card spot. Barring anything unbelievable, they are not a threat to take the division. The three other three teams in the division all sit in the league’s SOS top 10, with the Rays at No. 3 (.550), Blue Jays at No. 8 (.526), and Red Sox at No. 10 (.525).\n*Disclaimer: These numbers are going by strict strength of schedule based on actual record, but if you’re curious about a more projections-based strength of schedule, check FanGraphs. There, the Yankees have an almost perfectly-average SOS at .501, which sits between the Rays (.537), O’s (.519), Blue Jays (.488), and Red Sox (.481).\nThere’s no excuse for the Yankees to miss out on some series wins, especially against the easier opponents. However, they will lose the division if they lose crucial games against the more challenging teams, like the Rays and the Blue Jays. So, yes, they may have a more manageable overall schedule, but none of it matters if they can’t win against those other teams. \nThe Rays and Blue Jays play each other nine times over the next four weeks. Both teams could catch up to the Yankees quickly too, depending on the result of those matchups. The Rays also play the Red Sox six times, who they’re 9-4 against up to this point in the season. Again, this doesn’t bode well for the Yankees in their current “losing games against teams they should beat” predicament. \nThe road ahead is tough, and the Yankees can make it easier on themselves if they beat the teams they’re supposed to. However, baseball is a crazy game, and it’s easier said than done. Players are going to need to step up and break out of whatever funks they’re in, or else this could be a long last four weeks. There’s no question to the amount of talent that the roster has. It’s just a matter of getting hot at the right time, or at the very least, protecting a lead.",

At first, the only signs in the images of what’s going on are her surgical mask and the absence of other people. Then, in August, comes the wreckage – Maroun was 10 minutes’ drive from the port when the explosion happened. “When I opened my eyes, everything around me was destroyed,” she says. Her photographs, taken with the help of a drone operator, were an attempt to find meaning amid the debris. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photo by Adam Hagy/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Strider continues to exceed every expectation.  The last time I wrote about Spencer Strider, I was the one saying that the Braves would surely consider limiting the rookie right-hander’s innings after the All-Star Break.\nIt was—and still is—a sensible argument, and one that ultimately did come up at interview after interview with both Strider and Brian Snitker for weeks following the break. Snitker even seemed to hint at the fact that the Braves may have been treating Strider with a bit of caution recently during his postgame media session on Thursday.\n\n\n\"When he came in, he reminded me of Kimbrel. ... Now he's looking more like Tom Seaver.\"Braves manager Brian Snitker on Spencer Strider   pic.twitter.com/oKC2faAB8m— Bally Sports South (@BallySportsSO) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nStrider, of course, has consistently thanked everyone for their concern and insisted that he will be just fine with a typical starter workload.\nAnd fine he has been. More than that, actually, so I am absolutely thrilled to have been wrong so far.\nThursday’s franchise-record 16 strikeout performance was just another example of his dominance and composure beyond his rookie years. Truly, with as dynamic as Strider has been, the showing almost felt expected. I don’t need to regurgitate the stats you’ve surely seen—and if you need a refresher, check out this piece from yesterday.\nI was lucky enough to have been at Thursday’s game in person, so I was as blissfully unaware in section 222 as Strider on the field that he was approaching John Smoltz’s record. To be honest, after watching Max Fried throw not one but two Madduxes last season, I was actively tracking the rookie’s pitch count as the innings went on and hoping we might get to see that kind of history made.\nAfter the handful of baserunners in the eighth inning made it clear that a Maddux was out of reach, I was happy to settle with seeing Strider reach a new career high in strikeouts, and it was only as I watched him work his way through the high fives in the dugout via the Jumbotron that I realized what had happened.\nOne of the more underrated things about this year’s Atlanta team that I’ve only seen fleetingly mentioned on social media outlets is that they have a tendency to publicly celebrate each other’s accomplishments—something I feel has to be unique in the professional sport space, in the best way possible.  \nThursday was no different. You saw it in the way that each teammate wanted to give their own congratulations to Strider in the dugout and break the news of the record to him. You see it in the way they give thoughtful answers when asked—and, often unprompted as well—about their teammates during interviews. And you see it in the way that you can go to any given player’s Twitter or Instagram account, and they’re actively sharing posts about each other’s accomplishments, both on and off the field. Nearly every Instagram story I clicked through last night was a reshare of one 16 strikeout graphic or another.\n\n\nWow!!! That was one of the most impressive outings I’ve ever seen.— Luke Jackson (@YaBoy77) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nIt seems that last year’s “little bit of love” still lingers.\nI ended my last commentary on Strider with this note: however he’s used, Strider is a special talent, and I will not be taking a single 100+ MPH pitch for granted. The sentiment still stands, and I know his teammates feel the same way.",

        "description": "As one of the great Chico Marxist quotes of all time asks: “Who are you gonna believe, me or your lying eyes?” Every day it seems that more of our political leaders are asking — maybe ordering — Americans to ignore the wrongs they plainly see, in favor of narratives that are built on false and self-destructive ideology.\n\n\n\nAs Americans try to cope with exponentially diminishing security, supplies, affordable energy, savings accounts, job prospects, career-creating and career-relevant education, and even many of their liberties, those who are in charge insist, “Nothing to see here; move along.” We’re supposed to trust the nanny-state.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy would these politicians purposely ignore actual — and fixable — catastrophes that could negatively impact their own somewhat privileged lives and the welfare of their children if left unchecked? Biased minds are spot-welded to questionable ideology, anger, hate, hubris, and the inability to acknowledge that one is wrong.\n\n\n\nLet’s look at four examples of quality of life-destroying issues that some who worship at the altar of political correctness had a hand in either creating or denying, or both.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe first is the energy supply crisis spreading around the world — as in, energy that makes human life sustainable.\n\n\n\nWhile those pushing green and renewable energy solutions can deny it all they want, the truth is that fossil fuels remain the giver and protector of human life and civilization. Eliminating fossil fuels is tantamount to signing a death warrant for millions of people the world over. \n\n\n\nTwo voices, among many, have spoken out on this subject but, because of who they are, the green energy zealots — and their media and celebrity enablers — doubled down on their denial of any energy emergency that threatens others’ quality of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe first person who comes to mind was Donald Trump. Yes, alert the authorities: If Trump said it, no matter how accurate his warning as president may have been, many on the left will deny it, smear it and destroy it.\n\n\n\nBut, four years ago, during a speech at the United Nations, Trump warned that unreliable green and renewable energy sources would threaten the actual energy needs of Germany and Europe. The German delegation literally laughed in his face.\n\n\n\nThey’re not laughing anymore. With natural gas supplies from Russia essentially cut off because of the war in Ukraine, Europe is facing energy shortages and a potential crisis this coming winter.  \n\n\n\nThe next notable person I recall speaking out on the issue was Elon Musk, who recently said that “civilization will crumble” unless we continue using oil and gas in the short term. Earlier this week, he tweeted: “Countries should be increasing nuclear power generation! It is insane from a national security standpoint &amp; bad for the environment to shut them down.”\n\n\n\nThe green energy-pushing leftists can hate on Trump and Musk all they want, but that doesn’t make their warnings false. We can see for ourselves the energy crisis unfolding across Europe, which could reach our own shores. And then what?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNext, let’s consider the war zones that some of our cities have become. Not familiar with that story? I’m not surprised. Thousands of lives are being lost each year to urban violence. Why isn’t this a national emergency? Well, political correctness dictates that we can’t talk about those lost lives because many are the result of gang violence or turf wars between young men. Sometimes innocent children or women are caught in the crossfire.\n\n\n\nIronically — and quite brazenly, since some at the newspaper favored earlier calls to “defund the police,” which voters opted not to do — the Minneapolis Star Tribune recently published an editorial titled, “Curbing violent crime is an all-hands job.” An excerpt said: “Crime, particularly violent crime, is at near-record highs in larger cities in Minnesota, with emboldened criminals feeling freer than ever to wield even the deadliest weapons without regard for the law or human life.”\n\n\n\nNo kidding. That’s what happens when you demoralize the police, and some cities are experiencing difficulty replacing those who quit. That’s happening not just in Minneapolis but in cities elsewhere in the United States, and some cities have prosecutors who don’t want to prosecute certain crimes.\n\n\n\nFrom the epidemic of violence, let’s switch to the epidemic of obesity in America. Oh, wait — we can’t talk about that, either. Political correctness dictates that to address such an issue would be “fat shaming.” And yet, obesity is an epidemic that is contributing to the loss of tens of thousands of lives each year.\n\n\n\nWe see it, we know the grief it causes, but we’re told not to “believe our lying eyes.” It is much more politically expedient for some to normalize obesity and allow people to suffer from chronic illnesses or even die instead of addressing a health crisis that continues to get worse.\n\n\n\nAnd the topic of health brings us to the COVID-19 pandemic. Millions of deaths worldwide were attributed to the virus, but we still don’t know definitively how SARS-CoV-2 originated in Wuhan, China. Shouldn’t our political leaders try to get to the bottom of this? And if they don’t care to find conclusive evidence, why not?\n\n\n\nThese four issues alone are harming people worldwide. And yet, many of those who control the government, media, academia, science, medicine and entertainment either refuse to acknowledge it, or worse, seek to punish anyone who dares to question their politically correct policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf we don’t address the catastrophes we are witnessing with our own eyes, we risk the collapse of the infrastructure and rule of law that sustains society. The clock is ticking and the alarm signaling a point of no return is about to shriek.\n\n\n\nDouglas MacKinnon, a political and communications consultant, was a writer in the White House for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and former special assistant for policy and communications at the Pentagon during the last three years of the Bush administration.",

G.K. Butterfield was proud to be in Congress. Some years ago, the veteran Democrat installed a vanity message on his congressional license plate, broadcasting the district he represents: North Carolina 1.\n\n\n\nThose days are over.\n\n\n\nIn recent years, the number of menacing threats against sitting members of Congress has ballooned, forcing the Capitol Police to launch thousands of investigations; prompting a flood of new funding for lawmaker security back home and in Washington; and impelling lawmakers to take remarkable precautions to ensure they don't become the next target of political violence.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor Butterfield, that meant taking steps to become more anonymous when he's out in public.\n\n\n\n\"I've taken the congressional license tags off of my car, because I don't want to be identified publicly. It was right after Jan. 6,\" Butterfield said before the House left Washington for the long summer recess.\n\n\n\n\"I used to be proud to display the plate, had No. 1 on my plate for the 1st District — North Carolina 1,\" he continued. \"Used to be a time when people would pull up beside me at the stoplight and give me the thumbs up. But now it's different.\"\n\n\n\nThe source of the concern is not merely anecdotal. Over the past half-decade, the number of threat investigations launched by the U.S. Capitol Police has skyrocketed, from 3,939 in 2017 to 9,625 in 2021 — a spike of almost 150 percent, according to numbers provided by the department.\n\n\n\nAs members of Congress head into a long Labor Day weekend of parades, barbecues and other district events — a holiday marking the unofficial launch of the final leg of public campaigning ahead of November's midterm elections — they seem to be keenly leery of what they might encounter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"The threat level has been elevated,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the select committee investigating last year’s attack on the U.S. Capitol, said Friday. \"There has been a coarsening of discourse, and a perceived relaxation in inhibitions people would have about attacking public officials.\"\n\n\n\nRaskin spoke Friday while flanked by a security detail matching those assigned to each member of the Jan. 6 investigative panel.\n\n\n\nThe spike in lawmaker threats has coincided with increasingly personal and bitter attack lines stemming from the Trump era, with Democrats maintaining that the blame falls squarely on the former president and his fiery rhetoric against perceived political enemies.\n\n\n\n“We hear — you’ve heard it — more and more talk about violence as an acceptable political tool in this country. It’s not. It can never be an acceptable tool,” President Biden said Thursday night in Philadelphia, where he castigated Trump and those who do not condemn violence as \"a threat to democracy.\" \n\n\n\n“We can’t be pro-insurrectionist and pro-American. They’re incompatible,” Biden added.\n\n\n\nTrump’s supporters have rushed to his defense, saying accusations that the former president encourages violence are merely political attacks designed to hurt his chances of returning to the White House in 2024.\n\n\n\nAttacks aimed at members of Congress have targeted Republicans as well, they note, including recently when Rep. Lee Zeldin (R) was assaulted on stage while speaking at a campaign stop in New York for his gubernatorial bid. \n\n\n\nZeldin escaped largely unscathed, though other attacks have gone much farther. In 2017, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) was shot on a baseball field during a GOP practice in northern Virginia, sending him to the hospital with critical injuries.\n\n\n\nIn another more recent incident, an armed man was arrested near Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's home in the middle of the night in June after making death threats. In that case, Republicans accused Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) of encouraging the situation&nbsp;when he warned Kavanaugh, in 2020, that the justice would “pay the price” if he rolled back abortion rights.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Rhetoric that incites violence toward any elected or appointed member of the three branches of our constitutional government is dangerous and condemnable,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), former head of the far-right Freedom Caucus, said after the June incident.\n\n\n\nLawmakers who are critical of Trump remain among those most frequently targeted for violence. The long and diverse list includes&nbsp;Republicans who voted for an infrastructure bill&nbsp;he opposed; Democrats who managed the former president’s impeachments; Republicans who supported his ouster after the Jan. 6 Capitol attack; and most recently the nine House lawmakers on the select committee investigating the 2021 riot, all of whom have round-the-clock security details.\n\n\n\nRachel Kleinfeld, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Republicans critical of Trump are particularly prominent targets because they’re viewed to be disloyal in the eyes of the MAGA faithful.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“People who show that there's a way to be a conservative and not be part of the MAGA faction are in the targets because that's the most threatening group,” Kleinfeld said. “You see that in every country where you start having this kind of factional violence is that, what's called ‘in-group moderates’ — who might not be moderate in their policy beliefs, but who don't believe in violence — are the first to be targeted.”\n\n\n\nAfter five years of steady threat increases on Capitol Hill, it’s unclear if 2022 will continue the trend. The Capitol Police reported opening “roughly 1,820 cases” between Jan. 1 and March 24 — on pace to top 8,000 incidents for the year, which would be well below the figure for both 2020 and 2021. But the department is now withholding the release of incremental figures and instead will provide annual numbers at the end of each year. The change, a spokesperson said, is designed to curb “confusion” surrounding the statistics.\n\n\n\nThe figures represent incidents of both “concerning comments and direct threats,” a determination guided by the Supreme Court, which has defined threats to be “statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.”\n\n\n\nSome incidents are more clear-cut than others.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn July, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), one of two Republicans on the Jan. 6 select committee,&nbsp;released a compilation of profanely violent threats&nbsp;made by phone to his office. This week, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who served as one of the managers of Trump’s second impeachment,&nbsp;released a similar audio message&nbsp;from a man threatening to come to Swalwell’s office with a gun for the purpose of assassinating him. And a number of other lawmakers have comparable stories, even if they haven’t released the threats publicly.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"There's an escalation,” said Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.). “We have some new interns and they're shocked [at] the level of animosity that people talk about when they call us — the level of hatred and threats. They were absolutely stunned, and I said, 'No, that's what we live with. And it's getting worse.'”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn July, the House Sergeant at Arms&nbsp;announced new funding&nbsp;designed to protect lawmakers from the enhanced threats: $10,000 to install alarms and other systems to bolster the security of their homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne House Democrat, who spoke anonymously so as not to become a greater target, said that’s not all: Local law enforcers also monitor the family house.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"We have a police car that comes once in the morning, and once at night,” the lawmaker said. “It's just not a time when everyone feels safe.”\n\n\n\nRebecca Beitsch&nbsp;contributed.",

tens of thousands of residents of Jackson, Miss., remain without clean water, some advocates say the situation stems from years of environmental racism.\n\n\n\nMore than 80 percent of Jackson residents are Black, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. On Monday, those residents saw their main water treatment facility fail in the wake of flooding, leaving them without clean water for drinking, bathing or cooking.\n\n\n\n“While the recent flooding has been a contributor to where we are today, this is not the first time this issue has come about, where the city of Jackson is without water and unable to function,” Vangela Wade, president and CEO of the Mississippi Center for Justice, told The Hill. “Over the last 50 years, you could say that this has been brewing because of the lack of investment in the city's infrastructure by primarily state leadership.”\n\n\n\nThe latest water issues come after the last two years saw the city’s water system fail an Environmental Protection Agency inspection — which found the drinking water had the potential to host harmful bacteria or parasites — and the bursting and freezing of pipes during a winter storm last year left residents without water for nearly a month.\n\n\n\nBut advocates say the crisis has been decades in the making. Jackson first became a majority-Black city in the years following integration. The white population fell from 52 percent to 43 percent through the 1980s, with another 35,000 leaving the city over the course of the 1990s, according to The Jackson Free Press.\n\n\n\nThis population loss has reduced the city’s tax base and left it with far less money for basic resources, and the city’s water infrastructure has felt the strain before, most recently in March 2021, when Jackson imposed a boil-water advisory.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"We have a really aged system that the city's annual budget, the revenue that the city brings in, is insufficient to meet that need,” Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba (D) said at the time.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to ABC News&nbsp;Wednesday, Lumumba said the latest water crisis “is due to decades, decades and decades, of possibly 30 years or more of deferred maintenance, a lack of capital improvements made to the system, a lack of a human capital, a workforce plan that accounted for the challenges that our water treatment facility suffers from.”\n\n\n\nWhile the city tried to fight the loss of water by handing out free bottled water to residents earlier this week, they quickly ran out. Now, some of that responsibility has fallen to local community organizations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor years, the anti-violence prevention program Operation Good has been delivering water to residents across the city. Gino, who is the founder of the organization and asked not to have his last name published, said his group began handing out water back in 2015.\n\n\n\n“This is nothing new for us,” said Gino, adding that the group prioritizes taking care of the elderly and disabled first, following up with children and those living in poverty. More recently, he added, they’ve been bringing water pallets to different schools that contacted Operation Good in desperate need of providing for their students.\n\n\n\nGino said he doesn’t normally use terms like “environmental racism” but added he knows “surrounding cities that are majority white that don’t have infrastructure problems like Jackson.”\n\n\n\n“Jackson’s infrastructure problems are horrendous,” he said. “For us to be the capital city of the state of Mississippi, it does not receive the attention, financing and things of that nature that it should.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGino said children in the city are exposed to raw sewage so often, they’ve become immune to it: it’s in their bathing water, it’s in their cooking water, it’s in their drinking water. And through it all, residents have still received water bills.\n\n\n\n“It always felt like it was a ‘Jackson problem,’ not a Mississippi problem,” Gino said. “It was a Black-people problem, not a majority-of-the-state problem.”\n\n\n\nCivil rights leader Benjamin Chavis coined the term “environmental racism” in the 1980s in response to the decision to site a landfill for hazardous chemical waste in a predominantly Black North Carolina town. Sociologist Robert Bullard later defined the concept as “any policy, practice or directive that differentially affects or disadvantages (where intended or unintended) individuals, groups or communities based on race.”\n\n\n\nAlthough there have been cases dubbed examples of environmental racism that involve active wrongdoing, advocates say it can also apply in situations where issues affecting nonwhite communities are simply considered less urgent or more acceptable.\n\n\n\n”What it means is that communities of color, particularly in this case, Black communities, are considered sacrifice communities, so that they aren't receiving the same attention as their white counterparts because they’re not deemed to be important,” Adrienne Hollis, vice president for environmental justice, health, and community revitalization at the National Wildlife Federation, told The Hill.\n\n\n\nIn addition to neglected infrastructure, she said, this can mean the location of high-pollution facilities in poor or minority neighborhoods and areas where residents “aren't provided the opportunity to improve their economic situation.”\n\n\n\nThe Jackson crisis is part of “the conversations about how Black communities are deprioritized when it comes to ensuring that there's infrastructure planning, ensuring there is resiliency built within the communities,” said Abre' Conner, director of environmental and climate justice at the NAACP. \"[Jackson] is just a failure of individuals who have the power to ensure that the infrastructure is there [to] actually acting on it and ensure that a predominantly Black community actually has water and other infrastructure that is needed when there is a disaster that actually hits.”\n\n\n\nThis week, #jxnwatercrisis and #jacksonwatercrisis trended on Twitter as residents posted photos of discolored water. President Biden declared the crisis an emergency, freeing up federal resources to help the state’s response.\n\n\n\nBut the city’s Democratic leaders and state Republican leadership have frequently sparred over where responsibility lies for fixing the capital’s water infrastructure. Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann (R) said in response to the 2021 crisis that “the prime mover needs to be the city itself.”\n\n\n\nGino remains frustrated with local leaders, saying history has shown money has not gone to those who really need it.\n\n\n\n“Officials … see this city drowning, but instead of reaching in with a helping hand, they dodge it because we’re dealing with Republicans and Democrats,” he said. “But the people of Jackson don’t give a damn about Republicans or Democrats, they’re all the same to the people of Jackson because they’re not doing [anything]. Forget about the politics and think about the people.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA long-term solution, according to Conner of the NAACP, would involve resiliency planning that accounts for decades of neglect in communities like Jackson.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“That is part of planning for a climate crisis,” she said. “And so if the infrastructure is not there, and you do have those impacts of the climate crisis that are now coming to the hilt, then Black communities are now going to feel that impact.”",

Now Mikhail Gorbachev is here, pale in a spotlit coffin: the last Soviet leader finally being laid to rest.Vladimir Putin is not here, a snub that the Kremlin has said was a result of his busy work schedule. Yet thousands of Russians have come to pay their respects, lining up past the downtown theatres and trendy cafes, each person a reminder that Mikhail Gorbachev still remains a hero to some.

Its centerpiece — his Thursday speech warning against the anti-democratic assault from former President Donald Trump and his core followers — was an election-season clarion call unlike anything in modern American history, Eugene, Sam Stein and Jonathan Lemire write this morning.”\n\n\n\n“The speech was months in the making. Aides said Biden started planning a democracy-themed address in June, but events continued to get in the way of its delivery.”",

        "description": "Playbook: “Months ago, with the economy in flux, his legislative agenda adrift and his approval ratings mired in the 30s, President Joe Biden was ill-positioned to break through with any compelling message to the American people — let alone an existential warning about the state of American democracy.”\n\n\n\n“But Biden’s late-summer bounce has buoyed not only his poll numbers but also his credibility as he chose this week to launch a new broadside against his predecessor and his ‘MAGA Republican’ loyalists. Its centerpiece — his Thursday speech warning against the anti-democratic assault from former President Donald Trump and his core followers — was an election-season clarion call unlike anything in modern American history, Eugene, Sam Stein and Jonathan Lemire write this morning.”\n\n\n\n“The speech was months in the making. Aides said Biden started planning a democracy-themed address in June, but events continued to get in the way of its delivery.”",

Police say the pilot threatened to crash the aircraft into a Walmart.Rachel McWilliams/APUpdated September 3, 2022 at 4:17 PM ETThe pilot who threatened to crash a small plane into a Walmart in Tupelo, Miss., has landed safely and was taken into custody, local authorities said Saturday. &quot;Thankful the situation has been resolved and that no one was injured,&quot; Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves wrote on Twitter. The plane landed in a field northwest of an airport in Ripley, Miss. The pilot, Cory Wayne Patterson, 29, has been arrested and is being charged with grand larceny and making terrorist threats, Tupelo Police Chief John Quaka said in a news conference. Quaka added that he anticipates the federal government will also press charges.Around 5 a.m. local time, Patterson stole a fully fueled Beechcraft King Air 90 from the Tupelo Regional Airport, according to the police chief. Patterson worked for Tupelo Aviation inside the airport for 10 years, where he was responsible for fueling aircraft. He had some flight instruction but no license, according to Quaka. Quickly after departing the airport, he alerted emergency responders of his intention to crash into a local Walmart, Quaka said. No one else was aboard the plane.Residents were quickly asked to evacuate and avoid the area surrounding the local Walmart and Dodges&#x27; convenience store until the situation was resolved. A negotiator working with the police spoke with Patterson directly as he hovered over the city for four hours.  Patterson was also in contact with his family while flying the plane, the chief said. At 9:32 a.m. local time, Patterson wrote on Facebook &quot;a message in essence that said goodbye,&quot; Quaka said. At one point, Patterson agreed to safely land the plane in Tupelo but then changed his mind and flew northwest. At 10:12 a.m. local time, Patterson confirmed that he had landed the plane. The aircraft was damaged from the landing but still intact, Quaka said. He added that the police department has been in contact with Patterson&#x27;s family who were &quot;very concerned about the well-being of their family member.&quot;Tupelo Mayor Todd Jordan called the incident &quot;the best-case scenario&quot; given that no one was injured.  \nLocal authorities said Patterson&#x27;s motive has not yet been determined and the FBI is assisting with the investigation.\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

The edit button biases toward transparency, adding an edit history for every tweet and a big notice saying a tweet has been edited. Users will only have 30 minutes to edit their tweet, and will only be able to do so “a few times.” Twitter’s surely going to be looking closely at those numbers in its testing to see exactly how editable tweets should really be.

        "description": "Toronto Blue Jays shortstop Bo Bichette (11) celebrates the win with Toronto Blue Jays right fielder George Springer (4) at the end of the ninth inning against the Houston Astros at Rogers Centre. | Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Perhaps Not the Favorite Direction for the Astros in 2022 As the calendar flips into September and the regular season for baseball enters the stretch run, the Astros seems well-positioned to once again make noise in October, much as they have done the past five years. At the time of this writing, the Astros hold an 11-game lead over the Seattle Mariners for the AL West division, sit 11 games clear of a threat to a playoff bye, and are five games up on the Yankees for home-field for the AL playoffs. They trail the Dodgers by 6.5 games for home-field overall, but given the last couple of World Series appearances, that may not be a bad thing. \nYet, even as the Astros finish out the regular season and can start turning an eye towards the playoffs, there is a possible area of concern when it comes to playoff matchups. While the Astros continue to chew through most opponents, they have surprisingly struggled with opponents coming out of the East. Consider the latest standings: \nRecord vs. AL West: 42-21\nRecord vs. AL Central: 23-8\nRecord vs. AL East: 10-12\nYes, the team with the best record in the AL and the second best record in the league is under .500 against their brethren to the East. That is certainly an eyebrow raiser. Let’s look at a few of the matchups. \nHOU vs. TOR: Toronto won the season series 4-2 (2-1 at home, 2-1 on the road)\nHOU vs. BOS: Boston won the season series 4-2 (2-1 at home, 2-1 on the road)\nHOU vs. BAL: Baltimore won the first series 2-1 on the road. They have a 4-game home series against Houston from Sept 22-25.\nHouston has not yet faced the Tampa Bay Rays, but they will have six games against the Rays in their last 15. \nOf the teams mentioned here, three of them are significant players in the Wild Card chase. Surprisingly, Boston is not one of them. More surprisingly, Baltimore is, even after unloading a veteran like Mancini to Houston at the trade deadline. Tampa holds the #1 WC spot, and Toronto has the 3rd WC, two games back and 1.5 games up on Baltimore. Given that the Astros have faced off against at least one AL East team in the playoffs since they joined the AL, it would be very surprising if the Astros do not see at least one, if not more, AL East teams in the playoffs. \nGranted, regular season records do not always reflect what will happen in the playoffs (more on that later), but as of now, the Astros, should they face off against an AL East team, even if they have the likely home field advantage, should not presume to have it in the bag. \nOh, and in a bit of possible optimism (or pessimism), the Astros got to play against the NL East this season in their inter-league crossover matchups (along with a 4-game set against Arizona). How have those matchups gone: \nHOU vs. WAS: The Astros won 2-1 on the road \nHOU vs. MIA: The Marlins won 2-1 on the road\nHOU vs. ATL: The Braves won 2-1 at home \nHOU vs. PHI: Houston will host a 3-game set in the final series of the season (fallout from the labor issues that delayed the start of the season). \nGiven that the last two World Series match-ups for Houston saw them fall to NL East squads, these results may not be so shocking. Houston won’t have to worry about Miami, but they won’t get Washington either (for better or worse). The shift of the Phillies’ series offers some areas of concern. The Phillies started the season slowly, but they are now significant threats for the NL Wild Card. Depending on how the season has played out to that point, the series might mean everything to both teams, or it might mean nothing. \nTo this point, the Astros record against the “Beasts from the East” is a collective 9-15. Given their winning percentage this season, that is…not good. However, there is a rather “Big” caveat to those numbers. These are the 11 games that Houston played against the New York teams. In particular, 9 of those games were played consecutively at the end of June, with a doubleheader slated for the 1st day after the All-Star Break (another result from the lockout). The numbers: \nHOU vs. New York (Yankees): 5-2 (2-2 at NYY, 3-0 at HOU)\nHOU vs. New York (Mets): 4-0 (2-0 at NYM, 2-0 at HOU)\nThrow in the New York numbers, and that moves the Astros to a collective 18-17 against teams from the East. This is well below their winning percentage for the season. While Houston would have a high degree of confidence if they faced either of the New York teams, regular season results are no guarantee of post-season success. Remember that Houston lost the regular season series against the Yankees in 2019. \nEach series and each game has its caveats (all the Toronto games were played before mid-May when the Astros seemingly shook off their early-season malaise, the Yankee matchups were disrupted by rescheduling, and the Astros may or may not have a lot to play for when they face off against the Rays and Phillies). Still, the Astros and the Astros fan nation will need to be on guard if they face off against another squad from the East.",

        "description": "Can the new man in charge put a charge in the White Sox? Sure, the White Sox are playing baseball every day, but it’s impossible to ignore the giant vortex sucking all the air out of the room. So SSS duty geezer Leigh Allan and his son and west coast correspondent, Will, spend plenty of time making wild guesses about what the heck is going on with the HOFBP, whilst, with most of the fan base, wishing him well — but a recovery somewhere besides the dugout. That’s if a recovery is really needed — lots of doubts about what’s really going on, and slams at the front office for being its usual useless self in providing information.\n(One apology from Leigh — it turns out the Mayo Clinic has actually opened a campus in Arizona.)\nAs for actual baseball, recovering to win the final two games of a week when at least five should have been won didn’t exactly win praise, but it’s agreed sweeping Minnesota would do so ... though both scoff at YouTube announcer Yonder Alonso giving the White Sox a 50% chance to win the AAAL Central, which is five or 10 times the chance computer algorithms give. They also agree that probably no team from the division should be allowed in the playoffs at all, but that’s another story.\nAs for the nature of play, Leigh points out that while the White Sox have been bad at booming homers, they’ve also been really bad at lots of things connected to small, or smaller, ball — last in MLB in triples and stolen bases, next to last in getting runners home who made it to third with fewer than two outs, etc. \nAnd then there’s the bizarre nature of continuing injuries that simply shouldn’t happen to professional athletes ... with Will proposing a solution every 10-year old is familiar with.\n\nListen below, on our built-in Megaphone player:\n\n\n\nor follow along with every episode at Apple Podcasts or Spotify, or wherever you consume your podcasts. Or, you can watch the podcast on the South Side Sox YouTube channel.",

Born in London in 1959, Figes studied and lectured at Cambridge and later became professor of history at Birkbeck – a position from which he recently retired. His latest book is The Story of Russia, which condenses 1,000 years of history into a tightly written, illuminating 300-odd pages.You’ve written extensively about Russian history in previous books. What new perspective did you want to offer here?I was aware of the growing disconnect between how we [in the west] see Russian history and the way the Russians see it – particularly the way in which the Putin regime has propagandised a version that is increasingly imperial. I felt it was important to talk about the ideas of Russia’s history because, we now see, they were being weaponised to justify and sustain this war [with Ukraine]. I wanted to give the western reader a sense of the sacred power of the tsar, Russia’s special mission in the world, and so on. Continue reading...",

are about to witness a political turning of the tide. After three decades in power, the era of baby boomer politics is&nbsp;coming to an end, and millennials are set to become the new largest bloc of voters.\n\n\n\nThe differences between millennials and their predecessors on&nbsp;social issues&nbsp;and&nbsp;climate change&nbsp;have long been fodder for&nbsp;commentators&nbsp;and&nbsp;pundits. But perhaps even more consequential will be the reforms the next generation makes to the bedrock institution of our country: our elections.\n\n\n\nEach new generation has&nbsp;shifted&nbsp;the way America conducts its elections. Baby boomers, who came of age in an era marked by the&nbsp;Civil Rights Movement&nbsp;and the&nbsp;proliferation&nbsp;of primary elections, successfully&nbsp;lowered&nbsp;the voting age to 18. Generation X subsequently piggybacked off the anti-establishment strains of the boomers and pushed for&nbsp;campaign finance reform and term limits, albeit with&nbsp;mixed success.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow the millennials will have an opportunity to make their mark.\n\n\n\nWith previous generations doing much of the heavy lifting on&nbsp;who&nbsp;can vote, the next major shift may come in the form of&nbsp;how&nbsp;we vote. While some next-gen reforms, like online voting,&nbsp;just aren’t ready&nbsp;for widespread adoption, two election reforms&nbsp;are poised&nbsp;to make a substantial impact in the near future: blanket primaries and instant-runoff elections.\n\n\n\nBlanket primaries, also known as “jungle primaries,” place all candidates on one primary ballot — regardless of party affiliation — and ask voters to select from among them. The top candidates then move on to the general election. Blanket primaries won’t eliminate our country’s partisan animosity, but they may help reduce the influence of hyper-partisan base voters and open the primary process to millions of unaffiliated voters. With that in mind, a&nbsp;number of states&nbsp;have implemented blanket primaries in recent years, and more could be on the way with states like&nbsp;Wisconsin&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nevada&nbsp;considering the idea.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, instant-runoff elections, often referred to as “ranked-choice voting,” ask voters to rank candidates by personal preference. Vote counters then use these rankings to conduct an immediate runoff election until one candidate wins with majority support. Instant-runoff elections eliminate the “spoiler effect” and allow voters to support their favorite candidate, without fear of “throwing away their vote.” This, in turn, encourages candidates to run positive campaigns in which they must make the case to voters for why they should be ranked at the top of their ballots.&nbsp;Maine&nbsp;first employed instant runoffs in 2018, and a number of localities&nbsp;have started&nbsp;using them as well. Alaska recently passed a&nbsp;similar&nbsp;reform and will use instant-runoff elections in conjunction with blanket primaries starting this year.\n\n\n\nBlanket primaries and instant runoffs are intended to shake up our&nbsp;calcified two-party system&nbsp;and provide an opportunity for consensus candidates to emerge. Perhaps it’s no surprise that millennials, who are&nbsp;far less attached&nbsp;to the two major parties, are the&nbsp;most open&nbsp;to these reforms. Look no further than last year’s instant-runoff primary election in New York City. While every age group showed&nbsp;strong support&nbsp;for instant runoffs, voters younger than age 40 were the most enthusiastic, with 86 percent expressing a desire to continue ranking candidates in future elections.\n\n\n\nAll of this implies that millennials are unlikely to be swayed by arguments that we are better off with the “binary choices” of the existing two-party system.\n\n\n\nAs baby boomers age out of the political system, millennials are looking to reshape our country, from&nbsp;work&nbsp;to&nbsp;family&nbsp;to civic life. Reforming our elections, with blanket primaries and instant runoffs, may be among the most consequential changes brought by the next generation. Only time will tell.\n\n\n\nMatthew Germer is a resident elections fellow at the R Street Institute, a center-right think tank. You can follow him on Twitter at @mattgermer.",

But I began to see a new way of understanding empathy through debatingWhen I moved from South Korea to Australia at the age of eight, I learned the worst part of crossing language lines was adjusting to live conversation – to its rapid, layered rhythms and many about-faces. Once spun out, the best I could do was wait for a topic change or long pause to regain a foothold. Tripping over loose words and broken sentences, I never got far.This was a problem because there were many things I did not understand about my new home – why all public figures (including politicians) presented as sports fans, why strangers were called “mates”, why none of the food was spiced. Unable to ask questions, let alone to raise objections, I began to wear a distant smile and to retreat into the private corners of my mind. Continue reading...",

        "description": "inSpeaking of USB, here’s Louis Anslow, writing last month for The Daily Beast, on Democratic proposals to follow the EU’s lead and mandate USB-C charging ports:\n\n\n  Regulation is about predictability and familiarity, bringing order\nout of chaos. Thinking similar. Innovation is about\nunpredictability and unfamiliarity, it is about thinking\ndifferently. Creativity loves constraints, but it doesn’t love\nrules. When regulations mandate means, rather than ends, they\ncreate a box which to think outside of is prohibited by law.\n\nAll lawmakers should acknowledge this tension and dynamic.\n\n\nProponents of the EU’s USB-C charging port mandate speak as though bringing order out of chaos is still a problem to be solved in the mobile phone world, like it was 15 years ago. It’s not. Market forces generally work, and in the case of charging ports, they have: there are only two meaningful phone charging ports today, USB-C and Lightning. There is no chaos. There are good arguments for Apple to switch the iPhone to USB-C (high-speed data transfer, particularly for the 4K video footage iPhones have long been capable of, being at the top of the list), and good arguments against (zillions of iPhone owners with zillions of existing Lightning cables). But that should be for Apple to decide. \n\nCharging-port-regulation proponents often tell me the regulations are no impediment to progress at all. If someone comes up with a better-than-USB-C charging port, they can just bring it to the industry’s USB consortium and it’ll get approved and then all devices will use that new superior charging port. But that’s not how industry consortiums actually function. What actually happens is that consortiums entrench the current standard, because most companies have no interest in raising the state of the art. If they can just drag their feet and keep using what everyone is required to also use so long as they drag their feet, they’ll drag their feet.\n\nAnd why mandate that any new port be an industry standard? If some company comes up with the next breakthrough like Lightning was in 2012, why disallow them from keeping their own invention as a proprietary advantage? It was the existence of Lightning that prompted the USB-C connector to even exist. Prior to Lightning, USB connectors were both unidirectional (one side was up, the other down) and ungainly. Competition works, and technical progress is inevitable, but the EU’s mandate — which some Democrats foolishly want to copy — denies both of those facts.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

        "description": "Photo by Joe Puetz/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Baseball has the unique ability to give players opportunities to succeed after failure.  You can save your prospects and touted wunderkinds. I want to see the rejects and the retreads — those who have taken a second chance and succeeded. This is why I love baseball. It offers the unique opportunity for players to keep trying after failing. Baseball stands as a wonderful game of second chances. \nFailure is one of the common denominators in life. We all fail sometimes, and professional sports players are not immune. Fortunately, for most people, failure means having to change tack and try again. For most professional sport figures, failure can be a death knell for their ability to make a living as a player. \nThink about this: How many football players are able to become valuable contributors after flaming out? There are certainly exceptions, but they are definitely not the rule. Even then, you pretty much have to be a high draft pick to have a decent chance of being snapped up by another team.\nBaseball, though, is a different beast entirely. There are a lot of reasons why players can flop in this sport and still manage to transform into useful pieces on a team. One of the reasons could be that the minor leagues (including Indy ball) and international leagues give players the ability to continue practicing their skills. Another reason could be that the nature of the game allows players to thrive in reduced roles while not necessarily at the peak of human physical condition (I’m looking at you football). Either way, the only thing that matters is that we get to watch players make good on comebacks all of the time. \nJust on the Yankees’ extended roster, they have three players who have flopped harder than an aggrieved soccer player, and yet have managed to keep playing. Matt Carpenter, Nestor Cortes, and Lucas Luetge have each had to scramble to get on a Major League roster in the past couple years. Today, they have turned into valuable players. \nTo be fair, Carpenter did have a long-established reputation from his many years with the Cardinals. He made three All-Star teams, played a key role on a pennant winner in 2013, and is still beloved in St. Louis. By 2019, though his hitting started to suffer. That year, his triple slash line stood at .226/.334/.392 with an OPS of .726, and his batting only deteriorated from there. In 2020, his OPS sat at .639, and in 2021 stood at .580.\nAs a consequence, the Cardinals let him walk in free agency, and he had to accept a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers, where he was eventually released. The Yankees were able to pick him up, and the rest is history. (Now, they just have to hope that his broken foot heals in a hurry.)\n\nThe legend of Nasty Nestor began with an unspectacular thud. Picked by New York in a draft round that no longer exists (Round 36), Cortes had to leave the organization to simply make it to The Show, and his first taste of it in 2018 did not go well — his ERA was an ugly 7.17, and the eventual 115-loss Orioles cut him after four games. Things did not improve for him much from there. He did return to the Yankees and played 33 games with them in the #NextManUp year of 2019, but he could only be described as a replacement-level player. As a result, he was traded for future considerations to the Seattle Mariners, where he struggled with a 15.26 ERA in limited action.\nAfter coming back to the Yankees on a Minor League deal, Cortes managed to right the ship while working in Triple-A Scranton. He took advantage of an opening in the MLB rotation and kept throwing terrific outing after terrific outing in 2021, cementing his spot on the roster. Cortes has now managed to post an ERA below 3.00 in both 2021 and 2022, when he made his first All-Star team.\n  \n        \n      Photo by Mitchell Layton/Getty Images\n  \nLucas Luetge represents the most remarkable of second chances. Before becoming a member of the 2021 Yankees, he had not played in an MLB game since 2015 (and then he only pitched 2.1 innings). During that time, he bounced around a number of minor league clubs without ever managing to crack back into the Majors. In 2013 and 2014, his ERA sat right near 5.00.\nHowever, the Yankees saw something during Luetge’s work at Triple-A for the D-backs in 2019. He signed with the A’s for 2020, but after being stuck at the alternate site for the entire COVID-shortened season, he decided to give New York a shot. Like Cortes, he took a minor league deal with a non-roster invitation to spring training. Luetge was the surprise story of spring training, as the southpaw made the Opening Day roster and has been a steady bullpen arm since then. \n  \n        \n      Photo by Michael Owens/Getty Images\n  \nEach of these players has a different story, but each has one thing in common. They have been able to succeed thanks to the singular nature of baseball as the home of second chances. That’s why I love baseball: failure is not always the end with this wonderful game. It can just be the beginning of an even better story.",

        "description": "inSpeaking of USB, here’s Louis Anslow, writing last month for The Daily Beast, on Democratic proposals to follow the EU’s lead and mandate USB-C charging ports:\n\n\n  Regulation is about predictability and familiarity, bringing order\nout of chaos. Thinking similar. Innovation is about\nunpredictability and unfamiliarity, it is about thinking\ndifferently. Creativity loves constraints, but it doesn’t love\nrules. When regulations mandate means, rather than ends, they\ncreate a box which to think outside of is prohibited by law.\n\nAll lawmakers should acknowledge this tension and dynamic.\n\n\nProponents of the EU’s USB-C charging port mandate speak as though bringing order out of chaos is still a problem to be solved in the mobile phone world, like it was 15 years ago. It’s not. Market forces generally work, and in the case of charging ports, they have: there are only two meaningful phone charging ports today, USB-C and Lightning. There is no chaos. There are good arguments for Apple to switch the iPhone to USB-C (high-speed data transfer, particularly for the 4K video footage iPhones have long been capable of, being at the top of the list), and good arguments against (zillions of iPhone owners with zillions of existing Lightning cables). But that should be for Apple to decide. \n\nCharging-port-regulation proponents often tell me the regulations are no impediment to progress at all. If someone comes up with a better-than-USB-C charging port, they can just bring it to the industry’s USB consortium and it’ll get approved and then all devices will use that new superior charging port. But that’s not how industry consortiums actually function. What actually happens is that consortiums entrench the current standard, because most companies have no interest in raising the state of the art. If they can just drag their feet and keep using what everyone is required to also use so long as they drag their feet, they’ll drag their feet.\n\nAnd why mandate that any new port be an industry standard? If some company comes up with the next breakthrough like Lightning was in 2012, why disallow them from keeping their own invention as a proprietary advantage? It was the existence of Lightning that prompted the USB-C connector to even exist. Prior to Lightning, USB connectors were both unidirectional (one side was up, the other down) and ungainly. Competition works, and technical progress is inevitable, but the EU’s mandate — which some Democrats foolishly want to copy — denies both of those facts.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

        "description": "Photo by Todd Kirkland/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Atlanta is looking for its fourth straight win Saturday.  After knocking off Sandy Alcantara in the series opener, the Atlanta Braves will try to keep it rolling Saturday when they continue their series against the Miami Marlins. Atlanta tagged Alcantara for six runs and three homers in an 8-1 win Friday night. They have won three straight and can secure another series win with a victory Saturday. \nJake Odorizzi had been scheduled to start the second game of the series, but the Braves announced Saturday morning that the team had recalled Bryce Elder from Gwinnett and that he would make Saturday’s start instead of Odorizzi. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Justin Toscano reported that Odorizzi is dealing with some arm fatigue similar to what Kyle Wright dealt with in August. \nElder was part of the Braves’ rotation during April and largely struggled with his control. He has made 17 starts at Gwinnett and has a 4.64 ERA and a 4.53 FIP in 99 innings. While those numbers don’t look impressive, he has pitched better of late and has a 2.88 ERA over his last seven Triple A outings. The Braves called him up for a spot start on August 14 in Miami and he was impressive allowing three hits and a run over seven innings to go along with a career-high 10 strikeouts. \nRight-hander Edward Cabrera will make his ninth start of the season for the Marlins Saturday. Cabrera rejoined Miami’s rotation in August and logged four straight scoreless appearances highlighted by a two-hit, eight scoreless inning performance in Oakland on August 22. He struggled in his last outing against the Dodgers allowing five hits, three walks and six runs in 5 2/3 innings. \nAustin Riley extended his hitting streak to six-straight games and homered for the third straight game to set a new career-high with 34 for the season. He is 10-for-23 during his six-game hitting streak with two doubles and three home runs. Michael Harris won his second Rookie of the Month Award Friday and then went out and had two hits, including his 15th home run of the season. Harris currently has a 10-game hitting streak and has homered in two straight. He is 15-for-34 with five doubles and three homers during that span. \nSaturday’s game is scheduled to get underway at 7:20 p.m. ET and can be seen on Bally Sports Southeast. \nGame Info\nGame Date/Time: Saturday, September 3, 7:20 p.m. ET\nLocation: Truist Park, Atlanta, Georgia\nTV: Bally Sports Southeast\nStreaming: MLB.tv\nRadio: 680 AM / 93.7 FM The Fan",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/giants-place-alex-wood-on-15-day-injured-list.html",
        "description": "The Giants placed left-hander Alex Wood on the 15-day injured list due to a shoulder impingement, with the placement retroactive to September 1.  Outfielder Bryce Johnson was called up from Triple-A to take Wood&#8217;s spot on the active roster.\nGiven the date, it is possible Wood has thrown his last pitch of the 2022 season.  Manager Gabe Kapler told reporters (including Alex Pavlovic of NBC Sports Bay Area) that the team will re-evaluate Wood in a week&#8217;s time to see if a return is feasible.  Since the Giants are all but officially out of the wild card race, the club might decide to shut Wood down for the remainder of the campaign.  San Francisco will go with a bullpen game to cover Wood&#8217;s next scheduled start, and possibly for the rest of the season if Wood indeed doesn&#8217;t return.\nAs per most of the advanced metrics, Wood&#8217;s 2021 and 2022 numbers have been pretty much identical, with the southpaw posting a 3.60 SIERA last season and a 3.45 SIERA this year.  However, a few less bounces have gone Wood&#8217;s way, as while his real-world ERA was a solid 3.83 in 2021, that number ballooned to 5.10 in 2022.  Wood got great results from his sinker in 2021 and his slider was also a plus pitch, but both offerings have been below average this year in Statcast&#8217;s view.\nKapler noted that Wood has been trying to pitch through his shoulder problem, which could explain this downturn in production and, in particular, Wood&#8217;s recent shaky outings.  Over his last three starts and 12 1/3 innings, Wood has been tagged for a 7.91 ERA.\nShoulder and back injuries have hampered Wood in the past, most notably during the 2019-20 seasons when he pitched only 48 1/3 total big league innings.  Wood did rebound during the 2020 playoffs to help the Dodgers win the World Series, and he pitched well after signing a one-year, $3MM free agent deal with San Francisco in the 2020-21 offseason.  That resulted in a new two-year, $25MM contract to rejoin the Giants last winter.\nCarlos Rodon is widely expected to opt out of his contract and re-enter free agency, leaving the Giants with Wood, Logan Webb, Alex Cobb, Jakob Junis, and Anthony DeSclafani under contract or under arbitration control for 2023.  DeSclafani is a question mark after missing most of the season due to ankle surgery, but the Giants still have a decent core rotation in place, even if some additions will likely need to be made.",

        "link": "https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/09/03/c-s-lewis-longing/",
        "description": "&#8220;&#8230;only the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never visited.&#8221;\n\nNothing kidnaps our capacity for presence more cruelly than longing. And yet longing is also the most powerful creative force we know: Out of our longing for meaning came all of art; out of our longing for truth all of science; out of our longing for love the very fact of life. We may give this undertone of being different names &#8212; Susan Cain calls it &#8220;the bittersweet&#8221; and Portuguese has the lovely word saudade: the vague, constant longing for something or someone beyond the horizon of reality &#8212; but we recognize it in our marrow, in the strata of the soul beyond the reach of words. \nNo one has explored the paradoxical nature of longing more sensitively than the philosopher, storyteller, beloved Narnia creator, and modern mystic C.S. Lewis (November 29, 1898&ndash;November 22, 1963) in a sermon he delivered on June 8, 1941, which later lent its title to his 1949 collection of addresses The Weight of Glory (public library).\nIllustration by Margaret C. Cook for a rare 1913 edition of Walt Whitman&#8217;s Leaves of Grass. (Available as a print.)\nLewis &#8212; who thought deeply about the significance of suffering and the secret of happiness &#8212; writes:\nThis desire for our own far off country [is] the secret which hurts so much that you take your revenge on it by calling it names like Nostalgia and Romanticism and Adolescence; the secret also which pierces with such sweetness that when, in very intimate conversation, the mention of it becomes imminent, we grow awkward and affect to laugh at ourselves; the secret we cannot hide and cannot tell, though we desire to do both. We cannot tell it because it is a desire for something that has never actually appeared in our experience. We cannot hide it because our experience is constantly suggesting it, and we betray ourselves like lovers at the mention of a name. Our commonest expedient is to call it beauty and behave as if that had settled the matter. Wordsworth’s expedient was to identify it with certain moments in his own past. But all this is a cheat. If Wordsworth had gone back to those moments in the past, he would not have found the thing itself, but only the reminder of it; what he remembered would turn out to be itself a remembering.\nAs Lewis considers the illusory nature of these shorthands for our longing, we are left with the radiant intimation that &#8220;the thing itself&#8221; is not something we reach for, something beyond us, but something we are: \nThe books or the music in which we thought the beauty was located will betray us if we trust to them; it was not in them, it only came through them, and what came through them was longing. These things &#8212; the beauty, the memory of our own past &#8212; are good images of what we really desire; but if they are mistaken for the thing itself they turn into dumb idols, breaking the hearts of their worshipers. For they are not the thing itself; they are only the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never visited.\nFor Lewis, who was religious, this notion of &#8220;the thing itself&#8221; &#8212; the ultimate object of longing &#8212; was anchored in his understanding of God. For me, it calls to mind Virginia Woolf&#8217;s exquisite epiphany about the meaning of art and life, found while strolling through her flower-garden:\nBehind the cotton wool is hidden a pattern&#8230; the whole world is a work of art&#8230; there is no Shakespeare&#8230; no Beethoven&#8230; no God; we are the words; we are the music; we are the thing itself.\ndonating = lovingFor a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the unbearable name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

        "description": "MLB Photos Archive\n    \n\n  It had lasted 1,117 games. Cubs Hall of Famer Billy Williams owns the sixth-longest streak of consecutive games played in MLB history, 1,117 games. At the time he retired, it was the National League record, broken in 1983 by Steve Garvey.\nThis is the story of the day the streak ended, September 3, 1970.\nThe Cubs had a fast start to their 1970 season after the disappointment of 1969. They won 11 in a row in April and by early June had a five-game lead in the NL East. Then followed a 12-game losing streak which dropped the team under .500 in late June. (Thus began the “June Swoon,” a collapse endured by many Cubs teams in that era.)\nA 19-12 July got them back in contention and on September 2, they defeated the Phillies 17-2 and moved to within one game of the first-place Pirates.\nWilliams’ consecutive-game streak had begun to wear on him, even though 1970 was one of his best offensive seasons (.322/.391/.586, a career-high 42 home runs, 6.6 bWAR, second place in NL MVP voting). And so, after playing in 1,117 games in a row, Billy asked manager Leo Durocher for a day off. The Cubs won the game 7-2 and moved to within half a game of first place, and from the Tribune recap by Bob Logan:\n\nWilliams told reporters circling his locker, “I want to make it clear this was my decision. Leo knew I wanted to get the streak over with. \n“When I came into the clubhouse today, Joey [Coach Amalfitano] walked over and said, ‘You’re not in the lineup.’ But Coach [Herman] Franks made it plain that Leo said I could play if I wanted to.”\nThe Sweet Swinger said his current batting slump [0 for 12] was no factor in the decision.\n“I wouldn’t call it a slump,” he said. “There’s nothing wrong with my stroke or timing. I just wasn’t performing and the strain was there physical or mental. It could be both. All I know is that if I start a new streak tomorrow, I want it to include some World Series games. I want to play 10 more years and I know this decision will add time to my career. Right now I have mixed emotions about it, part relief and part sadness. But Leo was 100 percent right when he said I’d rather have a pennant.”\n\nWilliams never got that pennant, though he became the only one of the fabled 1969 Cubs to play in the postseason, playing in three games in the ALCS for the A’s in 1975 and going 0-for-7. Instead of 10 more years after 1970, Billy played six more seasons and retired at age 38 after 1976. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame 11 years later.\nWilliams’ streak had begun, with no fanfare, on September 21, 1963. Cubs manager (then called “head coach”) Bob Kennedy had given Williams the previous day off against another future Hall of Famer, Braves lefthander Warren Spahn. Williams had played in all the previous 155 games in 1963 and in the final 11 games of the 1962 season, so if he had played that late September 1963 game instead of sitting, his streak would have encompassed 1,284 straight games and he’d still hold the NL record.\nSince Cal Ripken broke Lou Gehrig’s supposedly unbreakable consecutive-game streak of 2,130 in 1995 and wound up with 2,632 straight games played, these sorts of streaks have become less important in MLB. Modern managers like giving their players occasional off days and the only streak of this nature since 2000 was posted by Miguel Tejada, 1,152 games between June 2, 2000 and June 21, 2007. The longest active consecutive-game streak is held by Matt Olson of the Braves, who has played in 267 straight games entering today’s action.\nStreaks like this are a bygone part of MLB history, and probably for the better. But back then they were a big deal and Billy Williams’ streak of 1,117 consecutive games played ended 52 years ago today, Thursday, September 3, 1970.",

        "description": "The Orioles announced that right-hander Anthony Castro has been claimed off waivers from the Guardians, and subsequently optioned to Triple-A.  Right-hander Phoenix Sanders was designated for assignment in a corresponding move.  In addition, Baltimore outrighted infielder Richie Martin to Triple-A, as Martin cleared waivers after being designated earlier this week.\nCastro has pitched in each of the last three MLB seasons, all with different teams &#8212; the Tigers in 2020, the Blue Jays in 2021, and the Guardians in 2022.  Cleveland acquired Castro from Toronto for Bradley Zimmer back in April, and Castro ended up posting a 7.43 ERA over 13 1/3 relief innings in the majors.\nWithin that small sample size, Castro issued 10 walks and allowed five home runs.  Control has been a persistent problem for Castro throughout his nine pro seasons, though at least at the minor league level, Castro has been able to mitigate a lot of those free passes due to some solid strikeout rates and grounder rates that routinely sit above the 50% threshold.  Over 596 1/3 minor league innings, Castro has a 3.47 ERA.\nBetween these decent numbers and a mid-90s fastball, Castro drew the Orioles&#8217; interest, and he&#8217;ll now provide some extra bullpen depth for the surprise contenders.  He&#8217;ll take the place of Sanders, who was himself a waiver claim off the Rays roster less than two weeks ago.\nSanders has yet to see any Major League action with the Orioles, so his big league resume consists of the 14 2/3 innings he tossed for Tampa Bay earlier this season.  The 27-year-old&#8217;s first taste of the Show resulted in a very respectable 3.07 ERA.  Pitching mostly as a reliever during his career, Sanders posted a 3.46 ERA and a 29.55% strikeout rate over 260 innings in the minor leagues.\nHowever, his work at Triple-A this year has been a struggle, with Sanders delivering only a 6.19 ERA over 32 frames.  Some back problems could be partially responsible, or perhaps Sanders had trouble adjusting to his first time being shuttled up and down between the minors and the Rays&#8217; roster.  Given his past track record, it would seem possible that another club might grab Sanders in yet another waiver claim.",

        "description": "Seventeen states with vehicle emission standards tied to rules established in California face weighty decisions on whether to follow that state&#x27;s strictest-in-the nation new rules that require all new cars, pickups and SUVs to be electric or hydrogen powered by 2035.Under the Clean Air Act, states must abide by the federal government&#x27;s standard vehicle emissions standards unless they at least partially opt to follow California&#x27;s stricter requirements.Among them, Washington, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon and Vermont are expected to adopt California’s ban on new gasoline-fueled vehicles. Colorado and Pennsylvania are among the states that probably won&#x27;t. The legal ground is a bit murkier in Minnesota, where the state’s “Clean Cars” rule has been a political minefield and the subject of a legal fight. Meanwhile, Republicans are rebelling in Virginia.The Minnesota Auto Dealers Association says its reading of state and federal law is that the new California rules kick in automatically in the state, and it&#x27;s making that case in court as it tries to block them.“The technology is such that the vehicles just don’t perform that well in cold weather,” said Scott Lambert, the trade group’s president. “We don’t all live in southern California.”Minnesota Pollution Control Agency officials say the state would have to launch an entirely new rulemaking process to adopt California’s changes. And in court filings and legislative hearings, they’ve said they are not planning to do that now.“We are not California. Minnesota has its own plan,” Gov. Tim Walz said in a statement. He called Minnesota’s program “a smart way to increase, rather than decrease, options for consumers. Our priority is to lower costs and increase choices so Minnesotans can drive whatever vehicle suits them.”Oregon regulators are taking public comments through Sept. 7 on whether to adopt the new California standards. Colorado regulators, who adopted California&#x27;s older rules, won&#x27;t follow California’s new ones, the administration of Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said.&quot;While the governor shares the goal of rapidly moving towards electric vehicles, he is skeptical about requiring 100% of cars sold to be electric by a certain date as technology is rapidly changing,” the Colorado Energy Office said in a statement.Regulators in Pennsylvania, which only partially adopted California&#x27;s older standards, said they won&#x27;t automatically follow its new rules. Under Democratic Governor Tom Wolf, Pennsylvania started the regulatory process last year to fully conform with California&#x27;s rules, but abandoned it.Virginia had been on a path to adopting California&#x27;s rules under legislation that passed last year when Democrats were in full control of Virginia&#x27;s government. But Republicans who control the House of Delegates and GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin say they&#x27;ll push to unlink their state.Minnesota’s auto dealers are trying to make their state’s current rules — and the possibility that they could tighten to incorporate California’s new restrictions — an issue for the fall elections. Control of the Legislature and governor’s office are up for grabs, and the dealers hope to persuade the 2023 Legislature to roll back the regulations unless they win in court first, Lambert said.The MPCA, with Walz&#x27;s support, adopted California&#x27;s existing standards through administrative rulemaking last year amid a bitter fight with Republican lawmakers who were upset that the Legislature was cut out of the decision. Legislators even tried unsuccessfully to withhold funding from Minnesota&#x27;s environmental agencies. One casualty was Laura Bishop, who resigned as MPCA commissioner after it became apparent that she lacked the votes in the GOP-controlled Senate to win confirmation.Walz and his administration have framed Minnesota&#x27;s Clean Cars rule as a fairly painless way to increase the availability of electric vehicles and help the state meet its greenhouse gas reduction goals. The rule seeks to increase the offerings of battery-powered and hybrid vehicles starting with the 2025 model year by requiring manufacturers to comply with California standards currently in force for low- and zero-emission vehicles.Lambert said the state’s auto dealers don’t oppose electric vehicles. They currently make up 2.3% of new vehicle sales in Minnesota and he expects consumer interest to continue to grow. But the reduced range of battery-powered vehicles in cold weather makes them less attractive in northern tier states, he said. Minnesota’s rules already threaten to saddle dealers with more electric vehicles than their customers will buy, he said, and adopting the California ban would make things worse.Under federal law, by Lambert&#x27;s reading, states have to either adopt California&#x27;s rules in full or follow less stringent federal emission standards. He said they can&#x27;t pick and choose from parts of each. And that effectively means there&#x27;s a “ban on the books” in Minnesota for sales of new conventionally fueled vehicles starting with the 2035 model year, he said.Lambert&#x27;s association was already fighting Minnesota&#x27;s existing Clean Car rules in the Minnesota Court of Appeals, and its petition foresaw that California would make the changes it announced late last month. A key issue in whether “any future amendments to the incorporated California regulations automatically become part of Minnesota rules,&quot; as the dealers argue.The MPCA&#x27;s attorneys assert that they don&#x27;t, and have asked the court to dismiss the challenge. MPCA Commissioner Katrina Kessler has made similar arguments for months, including before a skeptical state Senate committee last March.Aaron Klemz, chief strategy officer for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, which will be filing its own arguments against the dealers in court, acknowledged that the legal landscape is confusing. And he said it&#x27;s not clear whether his group will eventually call for Minnesota to follow California&#x27;s new ban.“We haven&#x27;t done enough analysis of the California rule to know if we&#x27;re going to push for its adoption in Minnesota,&quot; Klemz said. He noted that other issues are coming into play, including incentives for electric vehicles in the Inflation Reduction Act that President Joe Biden recently signed, and the stated intentions by some of the major automakers to go all-electric.",

This week’s episode of PYW’s is brought to you by the new Playstation exclusive “Spoiler”! Trapped in a run down basement, you spend 30+ levels fighting overachieving opponents who are trying to escape! You’re goal is to force as many of these moderately successful opponents to stay at your level. The only reward is a sense of accomplishment by ruining other people’s day. Think Fortnite! Available wherever video games are sold.\nWelcome back. Last week, in honor of seeing the bane of our existence, TLR, I asked you to mercilessly mock the concept of the unwritten rules and add your own addition to that rulebook that doesn’t actually exist. What did you think would fit in with the concept of don’t walk over the pitcher’s mound, don’t bunt to break up a no hitter, and whatever you do, don’t have fun? Let’s find out!\nIn third place, we have a tie between Diamondhacks and SpencerSpice with four rec’s apiece!\n  \n        \n  \nSeriously should be Unwritten Rule #1 the way these arguments usually play out.\n  \n        \n  \nYou heard the man. No further reasoning. If you don’t do it, Brian McCann will jump out of a closet and knee cap you.\nIn second place, we find Jack Sommers with 5 recs!\n  \n        \n  \nSad but true. The downside of this being such an active site is that these fun articles quickly get pushed down the front page and everyone moves on. Very sad.\nAnd rounding out our top three this week is NikT77 with 6 recs!\n  \n        \n  \nThe weird thing is, I feel like this should be an unwritten rule, and yet somehow it isn’t. Baseball is weird like that.\n\nWith his first place finish, Nik extends his lead over Hacks to four recs. Hardly an insurmountable lead, however, with four prompts remaining. Also, SpencerSpice makes his first appearance on the leaderboard. Now, on to the next prompt!\nSo the offense has been doing good lately. Like... really good. Well, except for Ketel Marte. He’s been not great at all actually. What punishment should he receive in Kangaroo Court? Go!",

        "description": "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will keep two inspectors at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in Ukraine, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi announced on Friday.\n\n\n\n“We are establishing a permanent presence on site, this time with two of our experts, which will be continuing the work,” Grossi said at a&nbsp;press conference.\n\n\n\nA team of&nbsp;IAEA inspectors visited the nuclear plant&nbsp;earlier this week amid ongoing concerns of a potential nuclear accident.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRussian forces captured the Zaporizhzhya plant early on in their invasion of Ukraine, but the plant is still operated by Ukrainian technicians. Located in southeastern Ukraine on the front line of the war, the nuclear power plant has faced numerous shellings, which Russia and Ukraine have blamed on one another.\n\n\n\nThe plant lost connection to its last remaining main external power line on Friday evening and was utilizing a reserve line, according to an IAEA press release. This same power line was also temporarily disconnected on Aug. 25. The plant’s three other such power lines were lost earlier in the conflict. \n\n\n\nOne of the Zaporizhzhya plant’s two operating reactors was also disconnected, the IAEA said. The other unit is still “operating and producing electricity both for cooling and other essential safety functions at the site and for households, factories and others through the grid.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The difference between having the IAEA at the site and not having us there is like day and night,” Grossi said in the press release. “I remain gravely concerned about the situation at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant – this hasn’t changed – but the continued presence of the IAEA will be of paramount importance in helping to stabilise the situation.”",

        "description": "Anthony Rizzo has been dealing with back problems for much of the season, and the Yankees first baseman received an epidural on Thursday that will sideline him for the next few games.  The plan is to have Rizzo in the lineup on Monday when the Yankees open a homestand against the Twins, manager Aaron Boone told reporters (including Kristie Ackert of the New York Daily News).  &#8220;This is something that should give him a lot of relief the rest of the way this season,&#8221; Boone said, also noting that Rizzo received a clean MRI on his back earlier in August.\nThe lingering back problems are a likely cause of Rizzo&#8217;s slump in August, as the first baseman has hit only .200/.282/.371 in his last 78 plate appearances.  Rizzo still has a healthy 136 wRC+ for the season even despite these recent struggles, but the Yankees surely need him back at full production for both the playoffs and what has become a surprisingly competitive AL East race with the surging Rays.\nMore from around the American League&#8230;\n\nThe Guardians didn&#8217;t have interest in Jesus Aguilar before the first baseman signed with the Orioles, Paul Hoynes of the Cleveland Plain Dealer reports.  Aguilar spent his first three MLB seasons with Cleveland in 2014-16, playing in only 35 big league games before being claimed by the Brewers in February 2017.  While he has enjoyed some success in his career, Aguilar has struggled in 2022, with only a .232/.282/.382 slash line over 463 plate appearances.  While the Guards are lacking in offense and Aguilar makes some sense as a first base/DH platoon partner with Josh Naylor, there&#8217;s no guarantee that Aguilar would&#8217;ve suddenly turned things around in Cleveland.\nEmilio Pagan drew some &#8220;mild interest&#8221; in trade talks before the deadline, The Athletic&#8217;s Aaron Gleeman reports.  Acquired as part of a notable four-player swap with the Padres before the season, Pagan&#8217;s first Twins season has difficult, with the reliever posting a 4.94 ERA over 51 innings.  Though Pagan has a very good 29.8% strikeout rate, he has been homer-prone, his 9.3% walk rate is well below average, and opposing batters are making tons of hard contact.  Pagan is arbitration-eligible this winter and might be a non-tender candidate, except the Twins feel they might still be able to deal the right-hander rather than let him go for nothing in a non-tender.\nRangers prospect Sam Huff has yet to receive a true extended look in the majors, with 10 games in 2020 and 30 games this season.  While Texas might call Huff up at some point before 2022 is over, the team will continue giving Huff regular work behind the plate at Triple-A while Jonah Heim continues as the regular catcher for the big league team, Evan Grant of the Dallas Morning News writes.  Heim still needs some seasoning in his own right, with interim manager Tony Beasley noting that Heim &#8220;needs to feel [an incresed workload] a little bit. That’s part of getting through the season, something that all everyday catchers have to feel.&#8221;  Heim has enjoyed a quality season on the whole, but his production has dropped off since the All-Star break, quite possibly because of his career-high number of MLB plate appearances and games played.",

        "description": "The Twins officially reinstated Tyler Mahle from the 15-day injured list, prior to Mahle&#8217;s scheduled start tonight against the White Sox.  Left-hander Jovani Moran was optioned to Triple-A to create roster space.\nMahle missed just a little beyond the 15-day minimum, as he was retroactively placed on the IL on August 18 due to inflammation his right shoulder.  The issue caused Mahle to leave his last start after 2 1/3 innings, but an MRI came back clean, and the Twins even considered only skipping Mahle for a single start in the hopes that he could avoid the injured list altogether.  However, the team opted for some caution given that Mahle also missed three weeks in July due to a shoulder strain.\nThat injury created doubt as to whether or not Mahle would be healthy enough to be traded by the August 2 deadline, but after he returned from the IL, the Reds indeed moved Mahle in exchange for three prospects.  Mahle was off to a nice start with Minnesota before his injury, posting a 2.51 ERA over three outings and 14 1/3 innings in a Twins uniform.\nGetting Mahle back in pretty short order is a sign of relief for a Twins club that is battling for both the AL Central (one game behind the Guardians) and for a wild card spot (four games behind the Blue Jays).  Today&#8217;s game has particular import for the Twins, as the White Sox are only two games behind Minnesota in the standings.",

        "description": "Before his season-ending hamate injury, José Rodríguez had turned the corner in Birmingham and was back on his MLB trajectory. | @JeffAllison2337/Twitter\n    \n\n\n  With a stellar finish to his season, the slugger is back on track for Charlotte and beyond in 2023 José Rodríguez’s season is over after hamate bone (hand) surgery after an awkward swing on August 20 so he cannot continue his hot couple of months, but boy, did he make the most of his shortened August. He just about had a 200 wRC+ (198) thanks to a huge increase in power. The nine homers in 17 games were the same number of singles he had. That’s a really fun stat, and he still had four doubles in there, and all of that comes out to a .449 ISO. It took a long time to find that power, but by the end of the year José finished with a .150 mark which is fine for a middle infielder, and we should expect it to be higher next season. With his injury, it seems like a return to the Fall League is out of the question, so hopefully the next time we see him is in Charlotte.\n\n\nNo way Jose!

He had a better wRC+ than José Rodríguez, but a poor stint in MLB and not as many runs produced for Sosa was the difference. Sosa had a slow start in Triple-A and hasn’t looked great in MLB, but he at least has turned it around in Charlotte now, with the power he had in Double-A finally coming back. He had six homers in 13 Triple-A games, with a seventh in MLB. Technically, sandwiched around a short trip to the majors, Sosa had four in a row for the Knights. One slight notation is he only had one other extra-base hit on top of those homers, so it really became homer-or-single type of month. Sosa has cut down on strikeouts, but his time in MLB definitely outed the biggest hole in his game right now, swing-and-miss. He has something to work on and knows what he should do to fix his game; he will just be 23 next year, still a very young prospect for someone on the doorstep of the majors.\n\nProject Birmingham\nBryan Ramos: Double-A .188/.188/.344 — 1 HR, 0 BB, 6 K, 2 R, 4 RBI(High-A: .311/.380/.475 — 2 HR, 7 BB, 10 K, 13 R, 12 RBI, 1 SB)Colson Montgomery: Double-A .100/.095/.150 — 0 BB, 6 K, 3 R, 2 RBI(High-A: .200/.327/.375 — 1 HR, 8 BB, 10 K, 5 R, 4 RBI)Luis Míeses: Double-A .414/.433/.586 — 1 HR, 0 BB, 1 K, 3 R, 8 RBI(High-A: .250/.281/.383 — 2 HR, 0 BB, 8 K, 5 R, 6 RBI)Duke Ellis: Double-A .313/.389/.375 — 2 BB, 6 K, 3 R, 1 RBI, 4 SB(High-A: .221/.264/.294 — 3 BB, 16 K, 10 R, 2 RBI, 8 SB)Wes Kath: Double-A .313/.313/.375 — 0 BB, 6 K, 2 RBI (Low-A: 263/.382/.544 — 4 HR, 11 BB, 23 K, 13 R, 6 RBI) Wilfred Veras: Double-A .267/.313/.267 — 1 BB, 3 K, 1 R(Low-A: .333/.342/.507 — 1 HR, 2 BB, 17 K, 8 R, 15 RBI)Jared Kelley: Double-A 4 IP, 6.75 ERA, 0 BB, 6 K(Low-A: 13 IP, 4.15 ERA, 12 BB, 11 K)Kohl Simas: Double-A 3 IP, 12.00 ERA, 1 BB, 3 K(Low-A: 11 2⁄3 IP, 7.71 ERA, 9 BB, 12 K)Norge Vera: Double-A 2 2⁄3 IP, 0.00 ERA, 3 BB, 4 K(High-A: 3 1⁄3 IP, 8.10 ERA, 4 BB, 5 K)Drew Dalquist: Double-A 2 1⁄3 IP, 11.57 ERA, 2 BB, 2 K(High-A: 12 1⁄3 IP, 10.95 ERA, 7 BB, 11 K)Cristian Mena: Double-A 3 IP, 6.00 ERA, 0 BB, 6 K(High-A: 9 2⁄3 IP, 3.72 ERA, 4 BB, 16 K)\n\nWinston-Salem Dash\nTyler Osik: .382/.444/.727 — 4 HR, 5 BB, 10 K, 9 R, 13 RBI **Monthly MVP**\n\n\nTyler Osik hits a  , his 1st HR in AA. Totally Obliterated. #Barons trail 2-1 in the 5th. #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/leHIgtwGTm— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nTyler Osik is actually in Birmingham now, but nobody would have slotted into the Dash section as a monthly MVP, so we kept him here. Yeah, most players of note are now one level up or one level below; Birmingham should be a very good team to start the year in 2023, though. Osik is becoming more and more like Yermín Mercedes every day. The bat seems to be good, though time in Birmingham will hopefully confirm or deny that, but he doesn’t really have a position. He started out as a first baseman and kind of left fielder but is now learning catcher, very slowly, and is otherwise a DH. I say slowly because he went from playing 73 2⁄3 innings of catcher last season to 152 so far this year. He has played the plurality of his games as a DH, just to get his bat into the lineup, and it works for whatever team he is on. The bat has played where he has gone, mostly as a great BABIP player, though in August (and why he is the MVP) there was more pop. The Sox have too many of these types of players ahead of him already and it is tough to see him leapfrogging any of them, but if the bat truly plays in Double-A maybe he will be a smart Rule-5 pick for another team.\n\nKannapolis Cannon Ballers (2022 Draft Class)\nJordan Sprinkle: .297/.366/.378 — 1 HR, 5 BB, 15 K, 13 R, 3 RBI, 6 SB (4th round pick, $452,900 bonus)Jacob Burke: .292/.418/.477 — 2 HR, 7 BB, 16 K, 11 R, 10 RBI, 4 SB (11th round pick, $225,000 bonus)Brooks Baldwin: .203/.272/.230 — 7 BB, 20 K, 11 R, 2 RBI, 1 SB (12th round pick, $125,000 bonus)Shane Murphy: 5 IP, 3.60 ERA, 3 BB, 2 K (14th round pick, $125,000 bonus)Jonathan Cannon: 3 IP, 0.00 ERA, 1 BB, 3 K (3rd round pick, $925,000 bonus)Billy Seidl: 6 IP, 1.50 ERA, 3 BB, 5 K (15th round pick, $100,000 bonus)Eric Adler: 2 2⁄3 IP, 10.13 ERA, 6 BB, 6 K (6th round pick, $200,000 bonus)Jonah Scolaro: 20 1⁄3 IP, 2.21 ERA, 9 BB, 31 K (UDFA) **Monthly MVP**\n\n\nJonah Scolaro went 5.0 for the #Ballers allowing 1 R on 3 H’s and 3 BB’s, but he strikes out 7 and mostly stifles the Mudcats offense. #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/F0OlqxlKJG— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) August 24, 2022\n\n\n\nKannapolis lost quite a bit of talent to Project Birmingham, it was not just Winston-Salem. So, the draft class and undrafted free agents are up and sucking up at-bats and innings more quickly than in a normal season. UDFA Jonah Scolaro was the best of the bunch in August. He is older, so he skipped the rookie leagues and went straight to Kannapolis once he was signed. He has been pretty good there, and is even in a starting role right now. He came out of Florida State as a reliever, but he pitched in the Atlantic League (Indy ball) as a starter. Scolaro’s slider is his best pitch, and good breaking balls usually mean good things in the lower levels even if the fastball isn’t top-notch. It is certainly working out for Scolaro, with a K-rate just below 35%. The Sox need more pitching in their ranks, especially higher in the system, look for Scolaro to be the type of guy that hangs around for a while. I won’t say he will never make it to MLB, not after Tanner Banks surprisingly did.\n\n\nACL White Sox\n\nDrake Logan: .150/.320/.250 — 1 BB, 10 K 2 R, 2 RBI (19th round pick, $125,000 bonus)Ethan Hammerberg: 6 IP, 1.50, ERA, 1 BB, 9 K (20th round pick, $100,000 bonus)Mark McLaughlin: 1 IP, 0.00 ERA, 0 BB, 1 K (7th round pick, $150,000 bonus)Dylan Burns: 25 1⁄3 IP, 1.78 ERA, 6 BB, 24 K **Monthly MVP**\n\nDSL White Sox\nGodwin Bennett: .381/.491/.786 — 4 HR, 7 BB, 7 K, 15 R, 15 RBI, 3 SB **Monthly MVP**Erick Hernández: .100/.182/.150 — 2 BB, 3 K, 2 RLoidel Chapelli Jr.: .308/.386/.436 — 4 BB, 4 K, 9 R, 4 RBIRyan Burrowes: .231/.340/.282 — 4 BB, 9 K, 11 R, 4 RBI, 5 SB",

death of a top Russian oil executive this week is the latest in a string of oil executives in the country who have reportedly died from suicide or in accidents this year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRussian media outlets reported that Ravil Maganov, the chairman of the board of Lukoil, Russia’s largest private oil company, died on Thursday after falling out of a window at a hospital where he was being treated. TASS, the state-run news agency, reported that an unnamed law enforcement source said Maganov died by suicide. \n\n\n\nMaganov was being treated at the hospital after having a heart attack and was taking antidepressants, TASS reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLukoil is one of the few companies that have publicly criticized Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, calling for an end to the conflict in March. More than half a dozen other oil executives have died this year under unclear circumstances.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere are the Russian oil executives who have died mysteriously in the past nine months:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLeonid Shulman&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLeonid Shulman, a top executive for the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom, was found dead of a reported suicide in a cottage in the village of Leninsky on Jan. 30. \n\n\n\nRussian media reported that a suicide note was found at the scene. The note reportedly said that Shulman had unbearable pain in a broken leg.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlexander Tyulakov&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlexander Tyulakov, another top executive for Gazprom, was found dead in the same village almost a month later in a garage. An independent Russian newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, reported that his death appeared to be a suicide. \n\n\n\nHe was also reportedly seen badly beaten on the night before his death.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNovaya Gazeta reported that Leninsky is considered an exclusive estate for top Gazprom executives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMikhail Watford&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUkraine-born oligarch Mikhail Watford, who became a billionaire through the oil and gas industry, was found dead three days after Tyulakov at his home in England. Local British officers reportedly said at the time that they considered his death to be unexplained but not suspicious. \n\n\n\nVladislav Avayev&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVladislav Avayev, the former vice president of Gazprombank, one of the largest banks in Russia, which has ties to the energy industry, was found dead in his apartment in Moscow along with his wife and daughter on April 18.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPolice reportedly found a pistol in Avayev’s hands, leading them to consider the incident a case of murder-suicide.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSergei Protosenya&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA similar incident occurred one day after Avayev’s death when Sergei Protosenya, a former deputy chairman of Novatek, a Russian natural gas firm, was found hanged while his wife and daughter were found stabbed to death, according to Radio Free Europe, a U.S. government-funded media outlet. \n\n\n\nThey were found at a villa in Spain. Police were investigating the death as a murder-suicide, but Protosenya’s son rejected the theory, saying that his father was not a killer and would never hurt his family, the British tabloid the Daily Mirror reported. \n\n\n\nAlexander Subbotin&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer top Lukoil executive Alexander Subbotin was found dead in May in the basement of a house near Moscow. TASS reported that Subbotin lost consciousness as a result of a heart attack, and police opened a criminal investigation into his death. \n\n\n\nYury Voronov&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYury Voronov, the head of a transport and logistics company that holds contracts with Gazprom for the Arctic region, was found dead in a swimming pool at his home in July.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe was found with a gunshot wound to the head, and a pistol was found nearby, according to local media. Some shell casings were found at the bottom of the pool. \n\n\n\nHis wife reportedly told police that Voronov began abusing alcohol in the two weeks leading up to his death, and he had lost a lot of money during that time in disagreements with contractors.",

We were watching TV and having a lively discussion about LGBTIQA+ representation when he jumped to his feet and retrieved a letter from his room, addressed to his father and me. It explained, in no uncertain terms, that he was transgender.It wasn’t entirely without warning. The year before, he’d told us he thought he might be gender fluid. Wondering if it was a phase, I’d found a counsellor for him at the local neighbourhood centre. Even so, the more definitive announcement came as a shock. In the family counselling session that followed, he stated his intentions: he wanted to be called Milo, he wanted us to use male pronouns and he wanted to transition socially at school.

I was living at my dad’s place in coastal Victoria when a friend came to visit, towing a friend of hers she’d mentioned before but I hadn’t met – a Melbourne musician. I was in no state to be receiving new acquaintances; I was there to recover from a near-fatal accident in Paris, preceded by the fiery demise of an engagement to a Frenchman. The musician seemed nice. But it was when he noticed my pathetic attempt to complete a David Astle cryptic crossword and said he did them too – or tried – that something sparked. My mind said, “I love you.” I may have said it out loud. I think I did. It was a joke. But I’d never met anyone interested in the Friday cryptic other than my nan.It was not the time or place for love. I was a mess of stitches and unwashed hair, partially incapacitated from a C2 fracture: robot-girl in an upper-body brace made of plastic and metal, complete with Velcro forehead strap detail. But the DA got us talking, and then it got him coming back – to drop off the clues he’d done, for me to add to. The crossword became the centrepoint of a slow, tracksuit-panted courtship – not that we had any idea at that point that was what it was. Cups of tea. Jam Fancies. The thesaurus. Medication schedules. I couldn’t understand why he had any interest in spending this swampy time with me. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Pitcher Ryan Weber is also back in the Yankees’ clubhouse with Anthony Banda gone. The moment that Andrew Benintendi grimaced in pain while taking a third-inning swing during Friday night’s loss, it looked like he could be in serious trouble. He reportedly heard a “pop” in his wrist and left in the middle of an at-bat, which never bodes well. X-rays soon afterward were negative, but an MRI taken today offered further concerns. The team is calling it “right wrist inflammation” for now, though manager Aaron Boone said that more tests will be needed to confirm what’s wrong.\nLosing Benintendi is just a tough blow, as he was one of the few hitters aside from Aaron Judge doing much of anything. He wasn’t extraordinary, but after a slow start following his trade from Kansas City, Benintendi was hitting .300/.338/.500 with a 138 wRC+ from mid-August onward. Now, he’s heading to the injured list for an unknown amount of time, and the Yankees will have to once again reach into their Triple-A reserves. Estevan Florial is coming back to the majors for his fifth different stint with the Yankees in 2022.\nThe 24-year-old is 1-for-20 in limited action so far this season, but he has posted better numbers in Scranton than he did last year. The 24-year-old is hitting .290/.372/.500 with 30 doubles, 15 homers, 34 steals, and a 130 wRC+. Florial still has a concerningly high strikeout rate at 30.1-percent though, and relatedly, the Yankees have been hesitant about using him too much in their own lineup. With their offense continuing to put up zeroes however, Boone might not have a choice* other than to try something different.\n*That does not apply to today’s lineup though, as Boone is using Aaron Hicks in left because... reasons. Florial is with the team.\nAnyway, Benintendi’s absence means that Judge’s best hopes for any offensive support are the following:\n\nGiancarlo Stanton, who hasn’t found his timing at all since returning from the IL\nDJ LeMahieu, who is playing poorly through a toe injury that has sapped his power\nGleyber Torres, mired in a horrendous second-half slump that might end his Yankees career\nHicks and Josh Donaldson, who are both hitting like they’re toast\nIsiah Kiner-Falefa, a contact hitter who has a 70 wRC+ in the second half\n\nIn other words, Judge just has Jose Trevino and a couple of rookies in Oswaldo Cabrera and Oswald Peraza. Egad.\n\n\n•Designated LHP Anthony Banda for assignment.•Placed OF Andrew Benintendi on the 10-day injured list with right wrist inflammation.— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nIn another move, pitcher Ryan Weber is back for another go-around with the team since Anthony Banda has been designated for assignment. Weber has made three appearances with New York in 2022, allowing one run on three hits and one walk in 7.2 innings. He’s done his job! Weber also has a 3.86 ERA and 4.56 FIP in 39.2 innings for Triple-A Scranton this year. He was scheduled to start on Saturday but flew down to Tampa to take Banda’s spot on the roster instead.\nBanda has pitched for five different teams in the past three years, and from what little we saw of him, there’s a good reason why. He was picked up pretty much just because Aroldis Chapman had to go on the IL due to his tattoo infection and the Yankees needed a body in the bullpen. In just 0.2 innings across two games, he walked five batters — including two last night with the bases loaded to make it a laugher — and gave up three runs. Weber could simply be replacement-level and be better than Banda. High bar!",

        "description": "Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images\n    \n\n  A slight mechanical adjustment has brought back Holmes’ previously stellar control. In my opinion, slight changes in mechanics and movement can always tell the story of a player’s ups and downs throughout the course of a season. There is a reason why players go through ebbs and flows. Movement translates into success or failure. For pitchers, the fine details behind the way and direction in which they release the ball are enough to tell the difference between balls and strikes.\nProprioception (the ability to feel one’s body in space) is a significant indicator of whether a pitch can make adjustments on the fly or not. Sometimes, your body restricts your ability to make those adjustments, and sometimes, it’s their brain (it also can be both). Both affect proprioception. In the case of first-half sensation Clay Holmes, it was clear that he had some sort of limitation in the way of feeling where his hand was in space. When you’re dependent on the forces of seam-shifted wake, like Holmes is, these slight differences have an even greater effect on where the ball ends up.\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nLet’s try and reason through how these changes in release point affected Holmes’ outcomes on the field. We will do it via some data and video.\nAs many fans know, Holmes’ breakout in pinstripes is largely attributed to his sudden ability to consistently throw the ball in the strike zone. His sinker movement was already unique. All he had to do was find the zone in some way, shape, or form. His success would come and go along with his control.\n  \n        \n  \nWell then. That’s a pretty steep drop off! How in the world does this happen to a pitcher?\nIt’s impossible to explain for sure, but perhaps there is some efficacy in the idea that Holmes’ back was ailing him and he didn’t really realize it till it was slightly more severe, or intense enough to warrant a break. Usually, a dropping release point is a decent predictor of future injury. Luckily for the All-Star reliever, it wasn’t in the severe version like it is for other pitchers.\n\n\nIt’s weird to see that Holmes was pushing the ball as much as he was in August. One of his greatest skills is his ability to stay behind the baseball and maintain a great angle with his torso to pair with his release.\nIn July, all of that went away. Holmes was standing almost completely upright. That tracks well with back pain or stiffness. If you can’t get any bend, your torso will stay too upright, and that’s not good for a pitcher like Holmes, who needs to a certain seam orientation (finger positioning) on the ball to keep his wicked moving sinker in the strike zone. \n\nThere’s something about this pitch (and the ones in recent weeks) that are ever so slightly different from the sinkers in July. It’s the difference in mechanics that produce a lower release point. In the clip against Joey Votto, he falls over his lead leg block too soon, and in the clip against Ryan O’Hearn, he doesn’t even allow his lead leg to block before he starts rotating his spine. Against Andrew Velazquez, his lead leg pushes force into the ground, sending energy back up his kinetic chain, resulting in a strong posture and a higher arm slot. That’s the crux. The difference in strength and timing of the lead block changes the release point and hand position. \nThanks to Holmes getting his release point closer to where it was in the beginning and middle of the year, the right-hander has had a few much improved outings. Seeing him induce a groundball against Mike Trout was one of those at-bats just makes you feel way better about where he stands. Holmes’ performance in the first half had a calming effect on the Yankees pitching staff. If they can get anything close to that performance, it’s one less area to worry about come postseason time.",

        "description": "Photo by Duane Burleson/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The big right-hander is back looking to make it two in a row over the Royals. After a rough go against the surging Seattle Mariners, the Tigers had the luck of the Irish on their side on Friday night against the Kansas City Royals. It was Irish Heritage Night at Comerica Park, so we’ll go with it despite little evidence of a particularly lucky streak running throughout Irish history. Either way, it’s just good to see the younger guys up and injecting a little positive energy late in the season.\nRookie infielder Ryan Kreidler didn’t notch his first hit as a major leaguer in the game, but he did walk twice and score two runs. He also baited Royals’ starter Daniel Lynch into a balk, which led to one of those two runs. As plate discipline is the thing standing between Kreidler and a long career in the majors, a pair of walks is a good way to start. Hopefully we’ll see him back in the lineup for this one, even if it’s only a pinch hitting appearance.\nOverall, I’m pretty confident that fans would like to see Riley Greene, Spencer Torkelson, Kerry Carpenter, and Kreidler in the lineup as often as possible down the stretch. Hopefully A.J. Hinch can manage to make it so. Saturday’s lineup will feature all four of them for the Comerica Park faithful. \nAs for Mr. Torkelson, he didn’t appear to make any major changes during his return trip to Triple-A, instead experimenting subtly with his stance, setup, and timing cues, trying to settle in and recapture his timing after a rough first attempt at the major leagues in which he was shockingly late even on routine fastballs down the middle in fastball counts. Did a rough start just get in his head and leave him thinking too much and caught between guessing at pitches and trying to react? Possibly. For a talented young hitter who still managed to control the strike zone quite well in his first major league action, the idea that his struggles were largely psychological and amplified by disastrous seasons around him from most of the teams’ veteran position players, doesn’t seem far-fetched. \nTorkelson went hitless in his return, but he did smoke one ball on a line to center field and was hit in another AB. So there wasn’t much in the negative column, though a nasty set of changeups away from Royals’ starter Daniel Lynch did carve Tork up pretty handily in the fifth inning. \n\n\n\nReady for some Saturday night baseball. pic.twitter.com/RUOh3tT0kY— Detroit Tigers (@tigers) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nDetroit Tigers (51-81) vs. Kansas City Royals (53-80)\nTime/Place: 6:10 p.m. EDT/Comerica Park, Detroit MI\nSB Nation Site: Royals Review\nMedia: Bally Sports Detroit, MLB.tv, Tigers Radio Network\nPitching Matchup: RHP Michael Pineda (2-6, 5.27 ERA) vs. RHP Jonathan Heasley (2-7, 5.22 ERA)\n\nThe Tigers opposing pitcher in this one, Jonathan Heasley, is still trying to find his way at the major league level. Heasley has one really good weapon in his 85-86 mph changeup. Beyond that he’s been extremely hittable in the majors, and continues to walk far too many hitters for big league work. \nHeasley throws his fourseam fastball about half the time. The pitch average 94-95 mph and has really good riding action. When Heasley’s command is good, he’ll get a decent amount of whiffs, but not as many as one might expect with such good metrics. He just doesn’t seem to have much in the way of deception, and his command isn’t good enough to spot the heater around the edges without making mistakes over the middle. \nDespite the quality changeup, Heasley tends to get lit up by left-handed hitters, while getting more weak contact in the air from right-handers. Both his slider and curveball are pretty pedestrian, giving up a lot of extra base hits, though not a ton of home runs. Overall it’s just a pretty average four-pitch mix delivered without much command in most outings. The Tigers’ offense is certainly one he might take advantage of, particularly if they chase the heater off the plate. However, if the Tigers’ hitters can avoid helping him out by chasing junk around the edges early in counts, they should have another pretty good night at the plate here. \nAs for Michael Pineda, we know what to expect at this point. If he’s commanding all three pitches, he should give the Tigers a solid outing and probably depart in the sixth at best. Unfortunately, we’ve seen precious few outings like that from him this season. Injuries have kept him from getting consistent work, and he’s been hit even harder than Heasley when he has been healthy. The Royals offense is a good one to try and get on track against, and Pineda’s career as a veteran fifth-starter could really use a solid month of September if he hopes to get another one-year major league deal this offseason. If the Royals are impatient, Pineda should do fine, but if not, they’re not going to have too much trouble sustaining traffic on the basepaths and making this a short outing for him.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/yankees-to-place-andrew-benintendi-on-il-designate-anthony-banda.html",
        "description": "The Yankees announced a series of roster moves today, with outfielder Andrew Benintendi heading to the 10-day injured list with right wrist inflammation. Outfielder Estevan Florial was recalled in a corresponding move. Additionally, right-hander Ryan Weber has been selected to the big league club, with lefty Anthony Banda designated for assignment.\nBenintendi, 28, left last night&#8217;s game after appearing to injure himself on a swing. Last night&#8217;s X-rays came back negative, but it seems the ailment is enough that the Yanks will keep him out of action for another ten days at least, as they try to figure out what&#8217;s going on. &#8220;Just not sure, like, where we thought, may not be injured,&#8221; Boone says in the video shared by Marly Rivera of ESPN. &#8220;So, they got to get more CT scans. I just got briefed on it a little bit so I really don&#8217;t have much for you other than he is going on the IL but it&#8217;s a little inconclusive right now exactly what.&#8221;\nGiven that uncertainty, it&#8217;s hard to know exactly how serious this will be for the Yankees. However, even a minimum absence could have an impact in this late stage of the season, as there are just over four weeks remaining on the regular season schedule. Acquired from the Royals prior to the trade deadline, Benintendi is having a solid season at the plate, one of his best showings in years. His .302/.371/.397 battling is 21% better than the league average hitter this year, as evidenced by his 121 wRC+. That&#8217;s just shy of his career best in that department, as he registered a 123 wRC+ back in 2018.\nThe Yanks will have to do without his production for at least the next week and a half, with the results of the continued testing still to determine the next steps. Until then, they will have to get by with an outfield mix consisting of Aaron Judge, Aaron Hicks, Oswaldo Cabrera, Marwin Gonzalez, Tim Locastro and Florial. Giancarlo Stanton could theoretically be a factor as well, though he&#8217;s been used exclusively in the designated hitter role since returning from his own IL stint. Despite running away with the AL East for much of the season, the club has been in a rough slide lately, seeing their lead over the Rays slip to just five games. They would surely love for someone in that group to step up and make up for Benintendi&#8217;s absence in order to help keep them in the driver&#8217;s seat down the stretch.\nBanda, 29, previously pitched for the Pirates and Blue Jays earlier this year, in addition to a brief stint in the minors for the Mariners. He signed with the Yankees on Sunday and made two appearances in pinstripes. The first one went well enough, as Banda entered the club&#8217;s game against Oakland on Sunday with one out and no one on in the fifth. He surrendered a walk sandwiched between two outs to finish the inning. His second appearance came last night and didn&#8217;t go nearly as well. With the Yanks down 5-0 to the Rays in the eighth, Banda entered with two men on and faced six batters, walking three of them, hitting another and giving up two singles. That leaves with a 40.50 ERA through two thirds of an inning as a Yankee, though a 6.75 ERA on the season overall. Despite that unfortunate ERA, he does have a career-high 22.2% strikeout rate on the year. The Yankees will place him on outright waivers or release waivers in the coming days, though Banda would have the right to reject an outright assignment in favor of free agency, by virtue of having been previously outrighted in his career.\nAs for Weber, 32, he&#8217;s bounced on and off New York&#8217;s roster all year long, generally faring well in brief stints with the big league club. He was first selected in June but was designated for assignment the next day. He cleared waivers, elected free agency and re-signed with the club on a new minor league deal. That same cycle happened two more times, making today the fourth time he&#8217;s been selected to the roster, never staying in the majors more than about a week. He has a 1.17 ERA in 7 2/3 innings over those sporadic showings, in addition to a 3.86 ERA in Triple-A for the year. His control has been excellent at both levels, as he has a 3.8% walk rate in the bigs and a 3.0% rate in the minors, much lower than the 9.1% average for an MLB reliever this year.\nLindsey Adler of The Athletic tweeted word from Boone about Benintendi&#8217;s IL placement before the moves were officially announced. Bryan Hoch of MLB.com relayed the Banda-Weber swap before the official announcement.",

        "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday accused Russia of cutting off its gas exports in order to increase pressure on Europe amid the war in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nThe Russian state-run energy company Gazprom said on Friday that it had completely&nbsp;shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline&nbsp;while it repairs an oil leak. Nord Stream 1 is the largest pipeline transporting natural gas from Russia to Europe.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“These days, Russia is trying to increase the energy pressure on Europe even more,” Zelensky said in an address to his country. “Russia wants to destroy the normal life of every European — in all countries of our continent. It wants to weaken and intimidate the entire Europe, every state.\n\n\n\n“Where Russia cannot do it by force of conventional weapons, it does so by force of energy weapons,” he continued. “It is trying to attack with poverty and political chaos where it cannot yet attack with missiles.”\n\n\n\nZelensky warned that Moscow is preparing for a “decisive energy attack on all Europeans” this winter and called for increased unity among Europeans and harsher sanctions against Russia.\n\n\n\nThe decision to shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for maintenance came as the Group of Seven agreed to a price cap on Russian oil on Friday. Since late July, the pipeline had been functioning at only 20% of its capacity, according to The Associated Press.",

        "description": "Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Cubs will try to even up their series in St. Louis. Saturday notes...\n\n\nTHE MADRIGAL FILES: Since returning from the injured list August 4, Nick Madrigal is batting .310/.383/.345 (26-for-84) with eight walks. These numbers are closer to what he hit with the White Sox before last year’s trade (.317/.358/.406 in 83 games and 324 PA).\n\nDOUBLING HIS PLEASURE: Ian Happ has 35 doubles this year, which is tied for fifth in the NL with Starling Marte. The last Cubs player to have 40 doubles in a season was Javier Báez in 2018; the last Cub to have more than 40 was Anthony Rizzo, who hit 43 in 2016.\n\nTHEY NEED THE SUN: The Cubs are 26-26 in day games this year, but 30-50 in night games. Of the team’s 30 remaining games, 13 are day games, 17 are night games.\n\nHE’S HOT: Seiya Suzuki, last 13 games since August 21: .386/.460/.546 (17-for-44) with four doubles, a home run and six walks. This includes six multi-hit games. Here’s hoping for a strong finish to 2022 for Seiya.\n\nHE’S NOT: Nico Hoerner, last 17 games since August 17: .164/.215/.230 (10-for-61), one double, one home run. He’s still not striking out much — only eight in that span — but it seems like he could use a day off.\n\nHere are today’s particulars.\nCubs lineup:\n\n\nHere is tonight's #Cubs starting lineup. pic.twitter.com/pHUyWnuCPj— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nCardinals lineup: \n\n\n9/3 St Louis Cardinals Lineup:1 2B Tommy Edman2 LF Tyler O'Neill3 1B Paul Goldschmidt4 3B Nolan Arenado5 DH Albert Pujols6 RF Dylan Carlson7 C Yadier Molina8 SS Paul DeJong9 CF Ben DeLuzio SP:Adam Wainwright #STLCards  #MLB— Grand Slam Picks (@GSMLBPicks) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nDrew Smyly, LHP vs. Adam Wainwright, RHP\n  \n        \n      USA TODAY NETWORK\n  \n\n  \n        \n      USA TODAY NETWORK\n  \n\nDrew Smyly had a fantastic August — five starts, 0.90 ERA, 0.933 WHIP — and that included a seven-inning, one-run outing against the Cardinals August 22 at Wrigley Field. Unfortunately, the one run was a home run by Albert Pujols — the only homer Smyly allowed the entire month — and that was the game where Jordan Montgomery shut out the Cubs on one hit.\nLet’s hope Smyly continues his great pitching into September.\nAdam Wainwright threw six innings and allowed two runs to the Cubs in the first game of a doubleheader August 23 at Wrigley Field. Those runs were enough to win the game.\nAt age 40, Wainwright is having an excellent season, worth 2.7 bWAR with a month to go. This will be his 48th career start against the Cubs. Only two pitchers have had more in the divisional play era (Steve Carlton, 65, and Bob Forsch, 49). \nWainwright might retire at the end of this season, but he’s given no specific indication he will do so, and off the season he’s having I can see him returning. \n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \nToday’s game is on Marquee Sports Network.

        "description": "Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Brian Snitker gave an update on Jake Odorizzi and also discussed the team’s outfield situation. Jake Odorizzi was originally penciled in to start Saturday’s matchup for the Atlanta Braves against the Miami Marlins. However, he was scratched this morning and was replaced by Bryce Elder who was recalled from Gwinnett. Braves manager Brian Snitker said that Odorizzi is fine, but was dealing with what they are calling arm fatigue. \n“He’s fine. Just got a little arm fatigue, we’re calling it,” Snitker said. “Nothing bad. It’s just an opportunity with the extra pitchers that we can fire somebody in here. Then the fact that we got Jesse back to give us some length. We’ll skip a turn and get him back in there against Seattle.”\nOdorizzi has made five starts for Atlanta since he was acquired at the trade deadline from the Astros in exchange for reliever Will Smith. He last pitched on Sunday night in St. Louis where he allowed four hits, two runs and struck out four in 5 2/3 innings. Snitker said that Odorizzi had been dealing with the issue and could have pitched, but they had the opportunity to give him some extra time and took advantage of it. \n“He’s been feeling it. We were kind of waiting. He threw a little bit and we were going to see,” Snitker said. \nThe situation worked out perfectly since Elder was lined up to start Saturday’s game for Gwinnett. Atlanta called upon him to make a spot start in Miami on August 14 and he was impressive holding the Marlins to just three hits and a run over seven innings while setting a career-high with 10 strikeouts. \n“For what he did the last time, your kind of confident in bringing the guy back to do that,” Snitker said of Elder. “We had a couple of choices that we could have used, but this actually was his day. Looking at it a couple days ago, it’s worked out perfect really.”\nOutfield Situation\nAtlanta’s outfield situation remains fluid and Snitker said that the team will continue to juggle its options in hopes that someone gets hot. \n“We are going to kind of spray all that thing around,” Snitker said. “We’ve got three guys and we’ll see if we can get a couple of them hot.”\nRonald Acuña Jr. will DH for the third straight game Saturday night. He was limping noticeably during a late inning double in Friday’s win although he was out for early batting practice Saturday. Marcell Ozuna made his first appearance since August 21 Friday night and will start in left for the second straight day. Snitker said Friday that he didn’t think Eddie Rosario’s hamstring was 100 percent yet, but Rosario is in the lineup Saturday and will play right field. Robbie Grossman will sit after going 1-for-12 over his last four games.",

        "description": "Serena Williams motions a heart to fans after losing to Australia&#x27;s Ajla Tomljanovic during the third round of the U.S. Open tennis championships on Friday in New York.Frank Franklin II/APLeave it to Serena Williams to not want to go quietly, to not want this match, this trip to the U.S. Open, this transcendent career of hers, to really, truly end.Right down to what were, barring a change of heart, the final minutes of her quarter-century of excellence on the tennis court, and an unbending unwillingness to be told what wasn&#x27;t possible, Williams tried to mount one last classic comeback, earn one last vintage victory, with fans on their feet in a full Arthur Ashe Stadium, cellphone cameras at the ready.The 23-time Grand Slam champion staved off five match points to prolong the three-hours-plus proceedings, but could not do more, and was eliminated from the U.S. Open in the third round by Ajla Tomljanovic 7-5, 6-7 (4), 6-1 on Friday night in what is expected to be her final contest.&quot;I&#x27;ve been down before. ... I don&#x27;t really give up,&quot; Williams said. &quot;In my career, I&#x27;ve never given up. In matches, I don&#x27;t give up. Definitely wasn&#x27;t giving up tonight.&quot;She turns 41 this month and recently told the world that she is ready to start &quot;evolving&quot; away from her playing days — she expressed distaste for the word &quot;retirement&quot; — and while she remained purposely vague about whether this appearance at Flushing Meadows definitely would represent her last hurrah, everyone assumed it will be.&quot;It&#x27;s been the most incredible ride and journey I&#x27;ve ever been on in my life,&quot; Williams said, tears streaming down her cheeks shortly after one final shot landed in the net. &quot;I&#x27;m so grateful to every single person that&#x27;s ever said, &#x27;Go, Serena!&#x27; in their life.&quot;Asked during an on-court interview whether she might reconsider walking away, Williams replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t think so, but you never know.&quot;A little later, pressed on the same topic at her post-match news conference, Williams joked, &quot;I always did love Australia,&quot; the country that hosts the next Grand Slam tournament in January.With two victories in singles this week, including over the No. 2 player in the world, Anett Kontaveit, on Wednesday, Williams took her fans on a thrill-a-minute throwback trip at the hard-court tournament that was the site of a half-dozen of her championships.Serena Williams returns a shot to Ajla Tomljanovic during the third round of the U.S. Open tennis championships on Friday.Charles Krupa/APThe first came in 1999 in New York, when Williams was a teen. Now she&#x27;s married and a mother; her daughter, Olympia, turned 5 on Thursday.&quot;Clearly, I&#x27;m still capable. ... (But) I&#x27;m ready to be a mom, explore a different version of Serena,&quot; she said. &quot;Technically, in the world, I&#x27;m still super young, so I want to have a little bit of a life while I&#x27;m still walking.&quot;With 23,859 of her closest friends cheering raucously again Friday, Williams faltered against Tomljanovic, a 29-year-old Australian who is ranked 46th.Williams gave away leads in each set, including the last, in which she was up 1-0 before dropping the final six games.Tomljanovic is unabashedly a fan of Williams, having growing up watching her play on TV.&quot;I&#x27;m feeling really sorry, just because I love Serena just as much as you guys do. And what she&#x27;s done for me, for the sport of tennis, is incredible,&quot; said Tomljanovic, who has never been past the quarterfinals at any major. &quot;This is a surreal moment for me.&quot;Then, drawing laughs, Tomljanovic added: &quot;I just thought she would beat me. ... She&#x27;s Serena. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s just who she is: She&#x27;s the greatest of all time. Period.&quot;Asked what she planned to do on the first day of the rest of her life Saturday, Williams said she&#x27;d rest, spend time with Olympia and then added: &quot;I&#x27;m definitely probably going to be karaoke-ing.&quot;Her performance with her racket Friday showed grit and featured some terrific serving, but it was not perfect.On one point in the second set, Williams&#x27; feet got tangled and she fell to the court, dropping her racket. She finished with 51 unforced errors, 21 more than Tomljanovic.Williams let a 5-3 lead vanish in the first set. She did something similar in the second, giving away edges of 4-0 and 5-2, and requiring five set points to finally put that one in her pocket. From 4-all in the tiebreaker, meaning Williams was three points from defeat, she pounded a 117 mph ace, hit a forehand winner to cap a 20-stroke exchange, then watched Tomljanovic push a forehand long.Momentum appeared to be on Williams&#x27; side. But she could not pull off the sort of never-admit-defeat triumph she did so often over the years.Serena Williams waves to fans after losing to Ajla Tomljanovic in the third round of the U.S. Open tennis championships on Friday in New York.John Minchillo/AP&quot;Oh, my God, thank you so much. You guys were amazing today. I tried,&quot; Williams told the audience, hands on her hips, before mentioning, among others, her parents and her older sister, Venus, a seven-time major champion who is 42.&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be Serena if there wasn&#x27;t Venus. So thank you, Venus,&quot; Williams said. &quot;She&#x27;s the only reason that Serena Williams ever existed.&quot;They started in tennis as kids in Compton, California, coached by their father, Richard, who taught himself about the sport after watching on television while a player received a winner&#x27;s check. He was the central figure in the Oscar-winning film &quot;King Richard,&quot; produced by his daughters.The siblings lost together in the first round of doubles on Thursday night, drawing another sellout. And on Friday, as during the younger Williams&#x27; other outings this week, there could be no doubt about which player the paying public favored.When Tomljanovic broke to go up 6-5 as part of a four-game run to take the opening set, one person in her guest box rose to applaud — and he was pretty much on his own.Otherwise, folks applauded when Tomljanovic double-faulted, generally considered a faux pas for tennis crowds.They got loud in the middle of lengthy exchanges, also frowned upon.They offered sympathetic sounds of &quot;Awwwwww&quot; when Williams flubbed a shot, and leapt out of their seats when she did something they found extraordinary. A rather routine service break was cause for a standing ovation.Tomljanovic draped a blue-and-white U.S. Open towel over her head at changeovers, shielding herself from the noise and distractions.&quot;Just really blocked it out as much as I could. It did get to me a few times, internally. I mean, I didn&#x27;t take it personally because, I mean, I would be cheering for Serena, too, if I wasn&#x27;t playing her,&quot; Tomljanovic said. &quot;But it was definitely not easy.&quot;After Williams struck a swinging backhand volley winner to take a 4-0 lead in the second set, her play improving with every passing moment, the reaction was earsplitting. Billie Jean King, a Hall of Famer with 39 total Grand Slam titles across singles, doubles and mixed doubles, raised her cellphone to capture the scene.&quot;You&#x27;re everywhere!&quot; yelled Williams&#x27; husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, from a courtside guest box that also contained power couple Ciara and Russell Wilson.Serena Williams follows through on a shot to Ajla Tomljanovic during the third round of the U.S. Open tennis championships on Friday in New York.Charles Krupa/APWhen Williams drove two consecutive forehand winners to lead 5-2 in the second set, she screamed and leaned forward after each.She could not sustain that level.Williams entered the night having won 19 times in a row in the U.S. Open&#x27;s third round of singles competition, including reaching at least the semifinals in her most recent 11 appearances in New York.Talk about a full-circle moment: The only other third-round loss she&#x27;s ever had at Flushing Meadows (she is 42-0 in the first and second rounds) came in 1998, the year Williams made her tournament debut at age 16.She would win her first major trophy 12 months later at the U.S. Open. And now she said goodbye in that same stadium.&quot;It&#x27;s been a long time. I&#x27;ve been playing tennis my whole life,&quot; Williams said Friday night, after performing one last twirl-and-wave move usually reserved for victories. &quot;It is a little soon, but I&#x27;m also happy because, I mean, this is what I wanted, what I want.&quot; Copyright 2022 NPR.

Peltola’s win in the Alaska special election this week became the latest surprise to spark concern for Republicans as it appears that a once presumptive red wave in November is neither definite nor guaranteed.\n\n\n\nPeltola, the first Alaska Native and first Democrat in decades to be elected to fill the state’s lone House seat, edged out two formidable Republican challengers on Wednesday, including former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R), to serve the remainder of the late Rep. Don Young’s (R) term.\n\n\n\nThe win came about a week after Democrat Pat Ryan prevailed against Republican Marc Molinaro in a New York special election in what was considered a bellwether ahead of the midterms.\n\n\n\nWhile Peltola was likely aided by the state’s newly implemented ranked-choice voting system, her win also fuels further concerns for the GOP about how energized Democratic voters are, as well as the quality of Republican candidates running in critical races.\n\n\n\n“First thought was that the Republican Party has some work to do,” said Rick Whitbeck, who previously served as the vice chair for the Alaska Republican Party and now serves as the Alaska State Director for Power the Future, when asked about his reaction following Peltola’s win.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhitbeck said he believed Republicans’ underperformance in the special election was in part due to ticket splitting between Palin and fellow Republican contender Nick Begich III competing with Peltola. He said other reasons Peltola might have prevailed could be voters seeing it as a protest vote against the two Republican candidates or the fact that voters might have been uneducated about the candidates.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, Peltola’s win in Alaska comes with its own caveats that distinguish it from other recent races. For starters, this election cycle marks the first time the state has used ranked-choice to elect its representatives — a system some Republicans have criticized. The Last Frontier is also known for its uniquely independent brand of politics, where ticket splitting is seen as more common than in other states.\n\n\n\nBut the race also laid bare some of the challenges facing Republicans — including divisions plaguing the party.\n\n\n\nOne GOP strategist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, pointed to Palin’s standing in the state as an explanation for this week’s surprise upset.\n\n\n\n“I think you got to take into account the fact that Palin is just an extremely controversial brand in her own state, has been for a long time now,” the strategist said. “And so she had a core base of people that were always going to support her, but, you know, even in her own party, there was a lot of dissension and disruption, and you saw that, you know, gravitate towards a Begich, for example.”\n\n\n\nConcerns over the quality of the Republican candidates this cycle have become apparent in recent weeks, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) even citing that as a reason why the GOP was more likely to flip the House than the Senate this year. McConnell’s admission provoked a furious response from Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), the head of the Senate campaign arm, who called McConnell’s remarks “a shot at our candidates and the voters.”\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic optimism has only grown over the summer amid a string of victories for the party.\n\n\n\nIn Kansas, voters overwhelmingly rejected a ballot measure that would have given the state legislature more authority to regulate abortion in the Sunflower State.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFurther emboldening them were special elections in Nebraska, Minnesota and New York earlier this year that saw Democrats lose by smaller-than-expected margins. In another nod to Democrats’ momentum, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report this week shifted their ratings of five House seats toward Democrats.\n\n\n\n“I think what's happening in the Democratic Party right now is, and particularly among the House Democrats, is that the combination of the win in New York last week and Alaska has given Democrats — has changed the Democrats’ understanding of what's possible in the election,” said Simon Rosenberg, who has served as a senior adviser to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).\n\n\n\n“And we're now moving from sort of a defensive stance to a much more offensive stance,” he continued. “And I will tell you, I talked to the DCCC the afternoon of the New York special last week, on Tuesday afternoon, and they thought they were going to lose that race by three to four points, and we won by almost two and a half.”\n\n\n\nPeltola, who spoke to The Hill in a phone interview on Thursday, was more circumspect in her analysis of what her victory meant.\n\n\n\n“I don’t like to make too many predictions. I’m a pretty superstitious person and feel like making declarative statements tends to jinx things. So I do not want to speculate on national trends,” she said. “I won by a decent margin, but it certainly wasn’t a landslide. I’ll be taking a very careful look at where I need to focus more of my time in terms of outreach to Alaskans and connecting with voters.”\n\n\n\nMany Republicans remain confident their party is still in a good position heading into November.\n\n\n\nMatt Gorman, a former spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP’s campaign arm, said Peltola’s win was an “aberration thanks to ranked-choice voting.”&nbsp;He also pushed back against the idea that Republicans were performing less competitively than expected, citing Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District, which was one of several special elections held this year. He noted the late Rep. Jim Hagedorn (R-Minn.) won the House seat by close margins in 2018 and 2020.\n\n\n\nAnd Democrats clearly still have their work cut out for them. While there are new signs of hope that the party could retain control of the Senate, recent polling shows Republican candidates in states like Ohio and Georgia running closely alongside their Democratic counterparts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn Emerson College Polling survey&nbsp;released last month&nbsp;showed 45 percent of somewhat and very likely general election voters backing Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance (R), while 42 percent supported Democratic challenger Tim Ryan, polling that falls just outside the margin of error at plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA separate Emerson survey released earlier this week found 46 percent of very likely general election voters in the state supporting Republican candidate Herschel Walker compared to incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock (D) at 44 percent, falling within the margin of error at plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd while the Cook Report moved some House seat ratings toward Democrats this week, the nonpartisan election handicapper still predicts Republicans will win between 10 and 20 seats in November.\n\n\n\nStill, the primary season has at times been a difficult one for the GOP, which has left candidates bruised after some especially brutal primaries.\n\n\n\n“I've said this for the 30 years I've been involved in politics: Republicans don't always play nice,” said Whitbeck, the former vice chair of the Alaska GOP, when discussing the toll some Republican-on-Republican races have taken on the party.\n\n\n\n“Sometimes I wish the Republicans would figure out how to limit the damage, you know, the circular firing squad mentality,” he added.\n\n\n\nBut with the primary season largely wrapped up and many campaigns shifting into a general election mindset, some say it’s too early to speculate about how both parties will fare in the midterms — after all, there’s still more than two months to go.\n\n\n\n“The teams that win are usually the ones that are able to ride out those bumpy rough stretches and regain their footing heading into the fourth quarter,” said the GOP strategist who spoke on condition of anonymity, likening midterm races to NFL games.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“And in terms of this year, we're about to, you know, post-Labor Day is the fourth quarter of campaigning, and so even with Republicans having a bit of a bumpy stretch, I actually think Democrats may have hit their peak, you know, during halftime, but in the third quarter, which is just too early.”",

A doubleheader will be played tomorrow. Anyone ready for some AM baseball? \n\n\nTonight’s #Reds-Rockies game has been postponed due to rain and rescheduled as part of a traditional doubleheader tomorrow, September 4th starting at 12:10pm ET.— Cincinnati Reds (@Reds) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Colorado Rockies will face the Cincinnati Reds in game two of this series tonight.\nGermán Márquez (7-10, 4.97 ERA) will pitch for the Rockies. In his last start, he gave up only one hit in seven complete innings against the New York Mets, which was a drastic improvement from his performance against the Texas Rangers. In that start Márquez gave up six earned runs on eight hits. Hopefully he can find a way to channel whatever success he found in NY in Cincinnati tonight.\nNo matter the outcome, it’s exciting knowing that we get to watch Michael Toglia, Sean Bouchard and Elehuris Montero play. They are hopefully the future of this team and have a lot of talent to bring. I’ll take a rookie home run tonight, how about you?\nThe Reds will call on rookie Nick Lodolo (3-5, 4.30 ERA). He spent some time on the IL this season and returned in early July. Lodolo will likely be trying to strike out as many batters as he can. He has 82 strikeouts in his 67 innings pitched this season. The Rockies will need to be efficient to not be impacted by his strikeout rate. \nFirst Pitch: 4:40 p.m. MDT\nTV: AT&amp;T Sports Net Rocky Mountain (COL), Bally Sports South (ATL); MLB.TV\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM; KNRV 1150 (Spanish)\nLineups:\n\n\nHEY YOU.

        "description": "I&#8217;ve continued experimenting with Chromium Edge for fun and to see how it differs from Google&#8217;s Chrome browser, and I&#8217;ve found things I like both more and less. It&#8217;s certainly interesting, that&#8217;s for sure, and I&#8217;ve noticed that while Microsoft adds features quicker and earlier than Chrome, Google tends to wait longer, but implement Chromium-based tools in more innovative and unique ways.\n\n\n\nIn its latest effort make users more productive and help them multitask, Microsoft just added a slew of extra things to the right-hand side of the screen. As reported by Techradar, the company is implementing the sidebar to let you search, discover related content, play games, and check your mail without even leaving the tab you&#8217;re on.\n\n\n\nSource: Techradar\n\n\n\nThere is also a calculator built in, as well as some other tools. If this sounds familiar, that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s exactly like Chrome&#8217;s Side Panel that we speak so much about lately. However, unlike Edge, Chrome doesn&#8217;t have nearly as much crap piled into the panel, and I dare say what it does have is much more useful.\n\n\n\nBetween Google Lens, Reading list, bookmarks, and more, as well as a new customize feature for the browser itself, I&#8217;m starting to like it more than I thought I would. However, if Microsoft&#8217;s efforts are a sign of the future, what with both companies copying each other with the Chromium source code, then we may be in for a bunch of extra stuff in Side Panel that we never really even wanted or asked for!\n\n\n\nI hope Google is a lot more careful about how it moves ahead with Side Panel. It already has a calculator built into Google Search, your Chromebook and the Web Store, and games are in the Play Store and in the cloud. You can check your Gmail and that&#8217;s just a click away with a web app or URL, and &#8211; well, you get the point.\n\n\n\nSide Panel may offer quicker, more convenient access to these things, but that doesn&#8217;t mean everything should be housed there. I personally think that what Edge has done is unappealing, and if Google does end up going this route, the ability to hide or disable the panel itself would be a welcome addition.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Lon Horwedel-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Salvador Perez gets an entire day off Catcher Salvador Perez was hit on the hand with a pitch last night. The X-Rays were negative. However, he’s still considered day-to-day with a contusion. Somehow that actually resulted in the big veteran getting a rare entire day off without being in the IL. Too bad the Royals apparently can only replace him with Ryan O’Hearn.\nListen, I don’t dislike Ryan O’Hearn. And, in fact, I suspect if I ever met him I’d really like him. He seems like a quiet, friendly kind of guy who happens to be incredibly strong and one of a mere handful of the best baseball players in the world. If I was three-quarters as good at anything as Ryan O’Hearn is at baseball, I’d have to consider myself an incredibly fortunate individual. Sometimes I worry when we all rag on him so much, and on the organization for playing him, that he might read that stuff and take it personally. It makes me want to say nice things about him. It frustrates me that there is very little nice to say about his presence in the Kansas City Royals lineup.\nIn any case, Jonathan Heasley will take the mound for KC tonight. He is rapidly approaching O’Hearn/Jeremy Guthrie territory where the only reasonable take is to wonder why he’s still on the Royals’ roster regardless of what manner of human being he might be. He’s been worth -0.5 fWAR in 14 starts for KC this season. He has a 5.22 ERA and a 5.98 FIP. Only four of his starts have resulted in so little as a quality start. The last one was on July 4, when he went six innings, allowing one earned run and striking out only three while walking two. Maybe they could give him a shot in the bullpen? Starting does not appear to be in the cards for him.\nOn the other side, the Tigers will call on Michael Pineda. Pineda is a long way from his days as a young up-and-comer with the Yankees. Unfortunately, he never realized most of the promise he showed in his younger years. At age 33, he has a 5.27 ERA in 10 starts for the Tigers and has missed significant chunks of time to injury. He has only one quality start all season and has given up two or more runs in every start except his first and an injury-shortened outing in the middle of May.\nLineups\n\n\nJonathan Heasley head to the mound in Detroit as we look to even the series.#TogetherRoyal pic.twitter.com/YE5xCVn4Hj— Kansas City Royals (@Royals) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nReady for some Saturday night baseball. pic.twitter.com/RUOh3tT0kY— Detroit Tigers (@tigers) September 3, 2022",

        "description": "Photo by Julio Aguilar/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Yankees look to bounce back against the Rays on Saturday with Oswald Peraza in the starting lineup. The silver lining, albeit a very deflating one, is that the only way is up for this Yankees team that passed the normal struggles of a baseball season about a month or so ago. There’s no escaping the big letdown that this second half has been, but there is still enough time to regain form ahead of a postseason run.\nThis series at the Tropicana Field didn’t get off to a very promising start as the Yankees dropped the game last night by a score of 9-0. Despite allowing 12 hard-hit balls on the night, Domingo Germán managed to pitch a quality start, allowing a couple of earned runs on six hits, with two walks and one strikeout. However, the offense didn’t show up, and the bullpen imploded late, handing the home team an easy win and cutting the AL East lead to five.\nClarke Schmidt takes the ball looking to — and stop me if you heard this before — bounce back, following a subpar outing on the road against the A’s in which he allowed four runs on twice as many hits over four and a third. In his 33 MLB innings on the season before then, he had a 2.18 ERA and 3.88 FIP. Schmidt had a 3.23 ERA and 2.00 FIP in seven starts at Triple-A since beginning to stretch out in late June.\nCorey Kluber will make his fourth start against the Yankees this season, and if his track record is any indicator, he should perform well. Kluber has a 1.50 ERA over 18 innings against the Yankees this season, and he has an MLB-best 3.2-percent walk rate. On the whole, his numbers are more middling, but the Yankees’ offense is in the dumps right now and Kluber could certainly take advantage.\nAside from Aaron Judge’s home run chase (and rare leadoff appearance), something to look forward to today will be Oswald Peraza’s first big league start. He’ll play shortstop and bat eighth this evening after striking out in a pinch-hit cameo last night, his MLB debut. Oswaldo Cabrera wasn’t supposed to play last night and only entered due to Andrew Benintendi’s injury, but this time, he’s starting in right field. It’s good to see the Yankees at least trying something different after another anemic effort on Friday, though Aaron Hicks remains in the lineup.\nSpeaking of Benintendi, his wrist inflammation has landed him on the injured list for an unknown amount of time. Frequent fill-in Estevan Florial has returned to take his spot on the roster. Anthony Banda is no longer in the bullpen either, as he has been designated for assignments after a couple ugly outings; Ryan Weber is up from Triple-A Scranton in his place.

        "description": "The Mets announced tonight that they have placed right-hander Trevor May on the injured list, without providing a designation. Fellow right-hander Bryce Montes de Oca has been selected to take his place on the roster. Montes de Oca was not previously on the 40-man roster, which was full before these moves. Those facts, combined with the fact that the club didn&#8217;t provide an injury diagnosis, points to May being on the COVID IL. Players on that list don&#8217;t count against a club&#8217;s 40-man roster.\nAt this point, it’s not clear whether May tested positive for the virus, as players can also land on the IL for experiencing symptoms or for viral exposure. Without a positive test, there’s no minimum stay on the IL. But in the case of a positive test, MLB’s 2022 health regulations stipulate a 10-day absence, though a pair of negative PCR tests and approval from a trio of medical professionals (team doctor, league-appointed doctor, MLBPA-appointed doctor) can override that 10-day requirement.\nIt&#8217;s been a tale of two seasons for May, as he struggled immensely out of the gate. He had an 8.64 ERA after about a month, at which point he was placed on the IL due to triceps inflammation. He was out of action about three months, returning at the beginning of August and posting much better results. He has a 3.86 ERA since his return, along with an excellent 35.9% strikeout rate and 7.7% walk rate.\nMontes de Oca, 26, was a ninth-round pick of the Mets in the 2018 draft. He missed the 2018 and 2019 campaigns due to injury and then 2020 due to the pandemic. He finally made his professional debut in 2021, climbing to Double-A by season&#8217;s end. This year, he began back at Double-A and posted a 3.12 ERA in 17 1/3 innings, striking out 31.2% of batters faced while getting grounders on 68.4% of balls in play. He did walk an obscene 18.2% of batters faced, but nonetheless got a promotion to Triple-A. He&#8217;s since registered a 3.90 ERA in 30 innings there, with a 35.3% strikeout rate, 37.7% ground ball rate and 15.4% walk rate. In July, FanGraphs ranked him the #25 prospect in the Mets&#8217; system, noting that his fastball sits in the upper 90s with tailing movement. He will make his major league debut as soon as he gets into a game.\nIt&#8217;s not clear whether Montes de Oca has had his contract selected in the traditional way or as a COVID &#8220;substitute.&#8221; In the latter case, he would be eligible to be removed from the 40-man roster without first being exposed to waivers. Under the 2022 health and safety protocols, commissioner Rob Manfred has the sole discretion to determine whether teams are sufficiently impacted by COVID-19 to add a substitute to the roster.",

        "description": "Photo by Norm Hall/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Kyle Nelson “won” last night’s game. But did he really? \n\nToday's Lineups\n\n\n\n\nBREWERS\nDIAMONDBACKS\n\n\n\n\nAndrew McCutchen - DH\nJosh Rojas - 2B\n\n\nWilly Adames - SS\nDaulton Varsho - RF\n\n\nHunter Renfroe - RF\nKetel Marte - DH\n\n\nLuis Urias - 2B\nChristian Walker - 1B\n\n\nKeston Hiura - 1B\nCorbin Carroll - LF\n\n\nEsteury Ruiz - LF\nEmmanuel Rivera - 3B\n\n\nTyrone Taylor - CF\nAlek Thomas - CF\n\n\nVictor Caratini - C\nCooper Hummel - C\n\n\nJace Peterson - 3B\nGeraldo Perdomo - SS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorbin Burnes - RHP\nM. Bumgarner - LHP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast night was a perfect example of why reliever wins (unlike reliever losses) are a useless statistic. Kyle Nelson came in to relieve starter Zach Davies with two outs in the fifth of a scoreless contest, and a runner on first. But Nelson couldn’t find the plate with a GPS, throwing just three strikes in his first fifteen pitches, walking three consecutive batters to give Milwaukee a 1-0 edge before finally getting the third out. However, Arizona then scored twice in the bottom of the inning to take a 2-1 lead, and the rest of the bullpen did their job, with four scoreless frames. Result: Nelson was the pitcher of record when the D-backs went ahead, and so is credited with the W. \nI will say, Nelson has generally been very good this season, with an ERA of 1.56. So not to pick on him. While this probably deserves to be counted as among the least-deserved “wins” in D-backs’ bullpen history, there have been worse, to be sure. Here are some candidates for that dubious honor, in no particular order - except for the last one, which is likely the undisputed, all-time franchise winner in this category. \n\n\nAndrew Chafin, 4/28/15: 2.2 IP, 6 H, 2 BB, 2 ER. After coming in to replace injured starter Archie Bradley in the second, Chafin allowed eight base-runners across less than three innings of work, and blew a 3-1 advantage. The D-backs then retook the lead and cruised to a 12-5 victory, getting Chafin the decision.\n\nRandall Delgado, 9/12/16: 0.1 IP, 2 H, 1 BB, 1 ER. Like Nelson last night, Delgado could only retire one of four batters faced. He came in with the team down 7-6, allowing an inherited runner to score plus one of his own before getting the final out of the sixth, leaving 9-6 down. He then became the beneficiary of probably Yasmany Tomas’s highlight as a D-back. \n\n\n\nByung-Hyun Kim, 7/23/2002: 1.1 IP, 3 H, 0 BB, 0 ER. This was Nelson-like in that Kim’s ERA was unaffected by his suck. He came in 4-2 up with two out in the eighth, the bases loaded, and allowed a base-clearing double to Juan Uribe. That was a -52% WP play. AZ scored four in the bottom half to retake the lead, and Kim closed out the ninth. Still, at -44.1%, it’s the second worst WP for a relief win in team history. For comparison, Nelson was just -12.4%. \n[Weird note: all three of the games above were against the Rockies at Chase Field.]\n\n\nJ.B. Wendelken, 6/26/2022: 1.2 IP, H, BB, 2 ER. To that end, Kyle’s was only the fifth-worst Win Probability by a winning D-backs reliever this year. Top of the list is Wendelken’s -26.1%. He entered with a 5-3 lead and a man on first, going walk, three-run homer to end the inning 6-5 behind. After AZ tied it back up, J.B. worked a 1-2-3 sixth, then got five runs of support, as the D-backs eventually won a wild one 11-7. \n\nMicah Owings, 9/27/2011: 1.0 IP. 4 H, BB, 5 R, 4 ER. The worst WP for a relief win is Owing’s -49.3%. You almost certainly remember this. The game ended tied at 1-1 so went into the 10th, where we had a Micah meltdown, going to the bottom half 6-1 behind. With two outs, six AZ batters in a row reached, capped by Ryan Roberts’s grand-slam, which ran Owings’s record to 8-0. Fun fact: he had a worse ERA in his wins (3.65) than his no-decisions (3.52).",

The Mets have placed right-handed relief pitcher Trevor May on the injured list and called up fellow right-handed reliever Bryce Montes de Oca from Triple-A Syracuse. No reason was given for placing May on the injured list, but that has usually been the case when teams place players on the IL for COVID-related reasons.\nMay struggled mightily early in the season before missing several months with an arm injury. Since returning, he hasn’t quite pitched like his usual self, either, but the numbers have been better than they were pre-injury. In 9.1 innings since his return, May has a 3.86 ERA and 3.87 FIP, and his last three appearances were of the scoreless variety.\nMontes de Oca has spent the 2022 season pitching for Double-A Binghamton and the aforementioned Syracuse. In total, he has a staggering 72 strikeouts in 47.1 innings of work, but he’s also issued 35 walks over that time.",

The announcement comes after two scrubbed launch attempts of the massive rocket, and will likely result in a delay of several weeks. \nAugust 29th, 2022 was supposed to be the debut launch of the Space Launch System (SLS). That launch attempt was scrubbed after engineers noticed an issue with the temperature of one of the rocket’s four engines.

        "description": "Photo by Brace Hemmelgarn/Minnesota Twins/Getty Images\n    \n\n  It’s Tyler Mahle vs. Dylan Cease as the Twins look to rebound from yesterday’s disappointing loss Start time: 6:15 Central\nRecords:  Twins (67-63, 1 GB), White Sox (66-66, 3 GB)\nWeather: Partly cloudy, 30% chance for an isolated thunderstorm, first pitch 75°\nOpponent’s SB site: South Side Sox\n\nTV: FOX (Cory Provus and A.J. Pierzynski on the call)\nRadio: Treasure Island Baseball Network\n\nLast game: White Sox 4, Twins 3: Missed opportunities and a strange ending. RECAP\n\nScoreboard Watch: Guardians 68-62 (Curry) vs. Mariners 74-58 (Ray), 6:15 Central\n\nAssuming Tyler Mahle is healthy, tonight projects to be one of the better starting pitching matchups we will see in September, with Mahle squaring off with AL Cy Young contender Dylan Cease.\n\nCease operates mostly with mid-to-upper-90s four-seamers up in the zone, lots of upper-80s sliders, and occasional low-80s curveballs for get-me-over strikes or in-the-dirt chase swings. As you can see from his seasonal stats, he has reached another level this season after putting together a strong campaign last season (3.91 ERA / 3.41 FIP / 4.4 fWAR). \nHe was long a highly-regarded prospect, although evaluators had some modest fears of a future in the bullpen because of wobbly command. He’s improved that aspect of his game enough to thrive as a starter, although he still leads all qualified pitchers in walks allowed and walk percentage. While that is often a disqualifier for a starter, Cease has been able to make it work because he has an elite ability to spin the baseball and he uses that skill to get tons of whiffs and strikeouts and suppress squared-up, hard contact:\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n      Dylan Cease Summary\n  \nBrian Menéndez, writing for Five Thirty Eight, recently broke down the adjustments that have helped Cease improve upon a 5.79 ERA in 2019 and a 6.36 FIP mark in 2020. As you might guess, they have a lot to do with optimizing the finer points of his release to make better use of the raw spin on his fastball. As a result of some subtle tweaks, the active spin (or spin efficiency) on his four-seamer — that is, the spin that contributes to movement — has improved to 92% this season from 83% in 2020. He’s added about 2.8 inches of vertical movement (i.e., less drop) and missed a lot more bats with his four-seamer (24% four-seamer whiff% this season compared to 17.2% in 2020) as a result. (If you’re curious about how this works and why it can result in more missed bats, I encourage you to read this.) \nThis season, Cease has also jumped whole hog onto the “throw your best pitch as often as possible even if it's not your fastball” train. In his case, that’s his slider, and he’s been offering it on 42.3% of his pitches this season (30.6% last season). The thinking behind that shift is plain enough. Cease’s slider was his best-performing pitch by run value in each of the prior two seasons. This season, with the amped-up usage, Cease’s slider has been the most valuable pitch in baseball by a wide margin: \n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \nAll of that is to say, the Twins' inconsistent bats will have their hands full tonight. Many in the lineup should be familiar with Cease, as the team has faced him eight times over the past four seasons. This will be the second time they’ve seen him this season. Cease allowed one hit and struck out eight over seven scoreless innings at Target Field back on July 17. \nAs for trade deadline pickup Mahle, he’ll be making his fourth start for Minnesota, across which he’s allowed four runs in 14.1 innings with twelve strikeouts and four walks. This time he’s returning from shoulder inflammation after the minimum stay on the injured list. He left his last start against Kansas City following an alarming drop in velocity. Still, both he and the Twins are optimistic that he’s ready to go after he successfully completed bullpen and simulated game work earlier this week:\n\n\nTyler Mahle threw 30-ish pitches in the bullpen and a pair of 15-pitch innings today. Said he felt good and his TrackMan data was good. Sounds like he's still on track to return this weekend in Chicago as hoped.\"I'm pretty optimistic that I'll be good the rest of the year.\"— Do-Hyoung Park (@dohyoungpark) August 29, 2022\n\n\n\nTwins manager Rocco Baldelli cautioned in comments yesterday that Mahle might be pitch count restricted today. To make room on the 28-man roster for Mahle’s activation, left-hander Jovani Moran was optioned to AAA. At any rate, everyone in the Twins bullpen should be available again today, despite Sonny Gray’s short outing yesterday. The initial indications for Gray, who left after four innings with hamstring tightness, are that he’s avoided serious injury. He’s currently being listed as the probable starter for his next scheduled turn on Wednesday in New York, but it’s something to monitor considering his past with hamstring injuries. \nHere are today’s lineups:\n\n\nTyler Mahle is back on the mound. #MNTwins pic.twitter.com/psbX2olqgL— Minnesota Twins (@Twins) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nTonight's #WhiteSox starters at Guaranteed Rate Field.⏰: 6:15 p.m. CT : FOX : @ESPN1000  : @FDSportsbook : O/U 4 CWS Total Runs pic.twitter.com/wDx5UG38z0— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\n  Enjoy the Game!

Sorry not sorry.\nFirst pitch is at 6:15 p.m. CST on Fox, or listen on ESPN 1000 if you can’t take the commentary.

        "description": "Welcome back to the lineup, Kyle Stowers! | Jessica Rapfogel-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Orioles look to take the series tonight with a never-before-seen lineup. After securing the win yesterday with an unorthodox lineup, the Orioles tonight are rolling out what so many fans have been clamoring for: a lineup featuring all of Adley Rutschman, Gunnar Henderson, and Kyle Stowers. Those three represent the first three draft picks of the Mike Elias era and tonight is the first time they’ll all appear in the majors together. \nOf course, those who want to find something to complain about will, despite the fact that the Orioles just keep winning. Rougned Odor is back in the lineup after a night off yesterday, and some people won’t like that. Nor will they like that Terrin Vavra isn’t in there. As for me, I think this lineup is gorgeous. \nPitching tonight for the Orioles is Austin Voth, who continues to defy expectations. For the A’s it’s rookie Adam Oller, who has made 12 starts this year. Oller has had a pretty bad year, pitching to a 5.66 ERA in 17 games (12 starts). He did manage to pitch eight shutout innings against the Yankees in his last start. But honestly, who ISN’T pitching eight shutout innings against the Yankees these days?\nOrioles lineup\n1.

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/twins-place-jorge-polanco-on-il-select-jermaine-palacios.html",
        "description": "The Twins announced that they have placed infielder Jorge Polanco on the 10-day injured list due to left knee inflammation, retroactive to August 31. To take his place on the active roster, they selected the contract of infielder Jermaine Palacios. To open a spot for Palacios on the 40-man roster, catcher Ryan Jeffers was transferred to the 60-day IL.\nPolanco, 29, has been dealing with this knee issue for a while, having last played on August 27. IL placements can be retroactive but only to a maximum of three days. Minnesota&#8217;s primary shortstop for much of his career, Polanco has slid over to second base for the past couple of campaigns, yielding to Andrelton Simmons last year and Carlos Correa here in 2022. His bat has been just as productive as ever this year, as he&#8217;s hit 16 home runs and is slashing .235/.346/.405 on the season. That production is 20% better than league average, by measure of wRC+, just shy of his career best wRC+ of 124, outside of a five-game cameo in 2014.\nWith Polanco on the shelf, Nick Gordon has been manning the keystone this week. For the season, he&#8217;s hitting .279/.322/.440 for a wRC+ of 118. That should allow the club to avoid a significant downgrade on the infield, though it means Gordon is subtracted from an outfield mix that has lost Byron Buxton and Alex Kirilloff to the IL in the past month. The Twins are just a single game behind the Guardians in the Central division and four games back of the Blue Jays for the final Wild Card spot in the American League.\nPalacios, 26, briefly made his MLB debut earlier this year when selected as a &#8220;substitute&#8221; while Correa was on the COVID IL. He got into eight games before being returned to the minors. He&#8217;s played 101 Triple-A games and hit .283/.341/.462 on the year for a wRC+ of 112. Defensively, he&#8217;s played primarily shortstop but also spent some time at each of the other infield positions as well as the outfield corners, giving the club some extra depth all around.\nAs for Jeffers, this move is largely a formality as he has been out of action since mid-July due to a thumb contusion. He will now be ineligible to return until 60 days from his initial IL placement, which would be mid-September. He recently resumed baseball activities but hasn&#8217;t yet started a rehab assignment and was targeting a late September return to action.",

Ed Markey (D-Mass.) Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\n\n\nThe bill, which was introduced alongside a companion bill in the House, would require airlines to provide passengers with refunds or vouchers within 30 days of a flight cancellation.",

        "description": "This blog is now closedGet our free news app, morning email briefing or daily news podcastO’Connor defends Burke over letter to Fair Work CommissionO’Connor is asked about allegations that workplace relations minister Tony Burke wrote to the Fair Work Commission flagging the government’s intention to remove the right of employers to terminate agreements at a time when Dominic Perrottet is threatening to tear up an enterprise agreement with rail workers in New South Wales.Firstly, the first time it was raised by the government was in relation to the tugboat dispute. The NSW government was looking to terminate that, which would have reduced wages by 40%. The premier himself called these people heroes. That was the first time I think Minister Burke then raised concerns about that, rightly. I think the letter has just been a foreshadowing of our intent to the Fair Work Commission.The Fair Work Commission is independent and the president and the commissioners are pursuant to the Fair Work Act. The government, as a protocol, was foreshadowing our intent and we know there may well be employers that may seek to terminate agreements before the legislation.I think there’s been goodwill and an effort to work it through. What I will say is there are a lot of moving parts is because with rights to take action, either for employers or for employees or unions, there’s the role of the commission in terms of arbitration. That’s been a very important mechanism of any form of multi-employer bargaining. Also constraints on the level of action.I think you have to look at it all together. The focus is on getting agreements. What happened is we’ve seen collective bargaining halve in a decade and that has led to the lowest wage growth of any decade in living memory. Would it be compulsory or opt-in? All the business groups, even the Council of Small Business Organisations, say it has to be opt in. That will obviously be subject to discussions.

        "description": "NASA directors said in a press conference on Saturday that they would postpone the launch of the Artemis I rocket until after the current launch period, which ends on Tuesday, after two scrubbed attempts.\n\n\n\n“We will not be launching in this launch period. We are not where we wanted to be,” said Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems Development Jim Free.\n\n\n\nThe delay means that Artemis I will not be launched until at least the next launch period, which will occur in late September. However, the duration of repairs may mean that the rocket cannot be launched until October.\n\n\n\nNASA planned to launch the rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Fla. on Monday before one of its engines failed to condition to the correct temperature for the journey and a hydrogen leak occurred.\n\n\n\nThe second launch attempt occurred Saturday morning but was disrupted by a second liquid hydrogen leak.\n\n\n\n“​​We're not going to launch until it's right,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson at the press conference.\n\n\n\nHe continued: “We don't go until then, and we make sure it's right before we put humans up on the top of it.”\n\n\n\nThe launch team will decide a third date for the endeavor early next week, according to the conference.\n\n\n\nArtemis I is part of a NASA program that aims eventually to send people back to the moon for the first time since 1972.\n\n\n\nFree said that the spacecraft would return to the Vehicle Assembly Building before it is approved for launch.\n\n\n\nNelson emphasized that this was the safest decision, saying that NASA would never launch until experts believed that it was the right time.\n\n\n\n“These teams have labored over that and that is the conclusion they came to,” Nelson said of the strict launch requirements.\n\n\n\n“I look at this as part of our space program, in which safety is the top of the list.”",

        "description": "Ideas never die. If they become unpopular, people forget about them, but then they bounce back when a new generation rediscovers them. And whatever made the ideas unpopular the first time around happens again and the cycle repeats itself.\n\n\n\nCollective bargaining in the U.S. is currently on the upswing of that cycle. After decades of unions often being regarded as something in musty history books and nostalgic Bruce Springsteen songs, there are signs that it has caught on with a lot of workers, especially young progressive ones. A recent Gallup poll&nbsp;found&nbsp;that unions had 71 percent approval, the highest since 1965. To young workers, organizing is a fresh, new idea. They haven’t yet learned of the tradeoffs—yet.\n\n\n\nThe most high-profile recent union victories have been at Starbucks, where&nbsp;more than 200 cafes&nbsp;have organized. A bid to organize Amazon has proven more fitful, but unions have managed&nbsp;some wins. Congressional staffers have&nbsp;begun to organize&nbsp;for the first time ever. Workers in the&nbsp;video game industry&nbsp;have organized too. College athletes are pushing to organize, and the National Labor Relations Board&nbsp;has argued&nbsp;they are in fact employees.\n\n\n\nNone of these sectors have traditionally been organized. Their workers only know unions from the idealized version presented by labor leaders and progressive pundits.\n\n\n\nIt is workers’ right to organize if they so choose, of course. Forming a union does give them leverage against their employers, and for many workers that may seal the deal; but that comes at the expense of workers’ autonomy. The organized worker has, in theory, agreed to make certain sacrifices in personal choice in order to empower the union in its dealings with management. Some individual workers may not have agreed to those sacrifices, though. They might have been outvoted. Sometimes they don’t even know that what the union is doing on their behalf. Even when workers back their union, ensuring that the union stays on mission is an ongoing challenge.\n\n\n\nWorkers have various rights to monitor the union’s activities and even dissent from it. In the 27 states with “right to work” laws, workers can opt out of union membership if they choose. The Supreme Court’s&nbsp;Beckdecision allows workers to&nbsp;refrain from funding&nbsp;the union’s political and non-representational activities. But many workers may not may not know they have this right because it is up to their union to inform them, and unions have a&nbsp;poor track record&nbsp;of doing so. Why is that?\n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;National Labor Relations Act, the law that ensures collective bargaining rights, doesn’t distinguish between the workers and unions. In theory, those things aren’t in conflict because the union exists to represent the workers. In reality, the union is a legal entity that exists separate from the workers. It can be there before the worker takes the job and long after. Over time, the union becomes less democratic and more about serving the interests of those running the union.\n\n\n\nConsider the United Auto Workers (UAW). There isn’t an auto worker alive in Michigan, Ohio, or Wisconsin that voted to join the union. The UAW organized the “Big Three” U.S. automakers—Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler—in the 1940s and has been there ever since. In the last four years, two of the UAW’s recent presidents,&nbsp;Gary Jones&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dennis Williams, along with a dozen other top union officials, were found&nbsp;guilty of embezzlement&nbsp;as part of a scheme to siphon $1.5 million in money away from a worker training center.\n\n\n\nA Justice Department plea deal required the UAW to&nbsp;hold a referendum&nbsp;on changing its internal elections to give the members more say in how the union elects its leaders, since the process had long been rigged in favor of the existing leadership. Earlier this year, UAW members voted to amend the process to allow direct elections. That’s a good outcome, but it took the intervention of the Justice Department to make that possible.\n\n\n\nAlas, Democrats in Congress and union leaders are&nbsp;pushing&nbsp;for policies that would make unions even less accountable to their members, such as&nbsp;the Protecting the Right to (PRO) Organize Act, which would eliminate all 27 state right to work laws, force employers to give away workers’ private contact information, and seriously limit freelance contract work, which is usually non-union. That’s the wrong way to go.\n\n\n\nUnions should be accountable to their members and remain so. Congress should make right to work laws the standard nationally. It should require unions to make their finances public and periodically hold re-certification votes to ensure they retain their members’ support and transparent elections for leadership. If a union and the workers it represents are in harmony, then none of these reforms will hamper the union—and may even help it. They only become a factor if those same workers want to hold their union accountable. Who has a problem with that?\n\n\n\nSean Higgins is a research fellow for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free market public policy organization based in Washington, D.C.",

The Astros now possess a six-game lead on the Yankees for first overall in the AL. That is more than the five-game lead the Yankees currently hold over the perennial contenders, the Tampa Bay Rays, for first in the AL East. Could the hare-raising Yankees end up a Wild Card team behind the tortoises of baseball?\nIt’s a Show-Hei night. Probably next Saturday too. I’d like to see Luis Garcia and the Astros bats rise to the occasion and put another win in the Astros column.\nHere are the lineups. Yordan sits out yet again. Get well, brother, and save your strength for the playoffs. It’s a strong offensive lineup even without the big man in the #3 hole.",

        "description": "Zelenskiy urges EU to prepare fresh sanctions; Russia hits multiple residential targets in MykolaivSee all our Ukraine war coveragePresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy has pushed the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to prepare a fresh package of sanctions, including a ban on issuing visas to Russian citizens.Russian forces have hit multiple residential targets in Mykolaiv overnight, according to its governor, Vitaliy Kim. He said homes were damaged, as well as three hospitals, two education facilities, a hotel and a museum. A video showing Russian multiple-launch rocket systems firing from the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been published by the Insider. The footage, taken overnight on Friday into early Saturday morning, shows the missile launchers close to a power unit.The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal,  visited Germany on Sunday – the first high-level Ukrainian official to visit the country in months. The trip is a sign of eased tensions after a rocky patch between Kyiv and Berlin.Zelenskiy said Russia was using “poverty and political chaos” to attack the lives of all Europeans. In his evening address late on Saturday, the presidentsaid that by stopping the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, Russia wanted to “destroy the normal life of every European”.Russian forces are suffering from “morale and discipline issues” in addition to combat fatigue and high casualties, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. Troops’ main grievances probably continued to be around pay, including the high chance that “sizeable combat bonuses” were not being paid, the latest British intelligence update said.The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and is relying on a reserve line, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Previously, there had been reports the plant in south-eastern Ukraine had been knocked offline in the early hours of Saturday amid sustained shelling that destroyed a key power line, according to local Russian-backed authorities.Sweden has said it would provide liquidity guarantees to Nordic and Baltic energy companies worth “billions of dollars” in an effort to prevent a financial crisis sparked by Europe’s energy crunch.The Russian energy company Gazprom has said Siemens Energy is ready to help repair broken equipment for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, but claimed there was nowhere available for it to carry out the work.The European Union expects Russia to respect existing energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if it fails to do so, the economic commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said.Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told Vladimir Putin that his country can play a facilitator role regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, according to his office.

        "description": "Utilityman Niko Goodrum has cleared waivers and been released by the Astros, reports Chandler Rome of the Houston Chronicle. He was designated for assignment by the club on Thursday.\nGoodrum, 30, had a couple of solid seasons with the Tigers in 2018 and 2019, hitting 28 home runs and stealing 24 bags over that two-year stretch. His overall batting line of .247/.318/.427 was just barely below league average, as evidenced by his 98 wRC+. He played all over the diamond in that time, lining up at every position outside of the battery. He generally got quality marks for his glovework, helping him produce 4.5 wins above replacement total over those two campaigns, in the estimation of FanGraphs.\nHowever, he&#8217;s been in a downward spiral since then, which started with a rough campaign in the shortened 2020 season. He hit .184/.263/.335 that year while striking out 38.5% of the time. In 2021, he bounced back a bit but still disappointed. His .214/.292/.359 batting line led to a wRC+ of 81, much better than the 63 from the year before but a drop off from prior seasons. His strikeout rate improved to 32.9% but was still well above the 23.2% league average.\nAfter two straight down years, the Tigers cut bait and non-tendered him. The Astros decided to take a flier on Goodrum by signing him to a $2.1MM contract for 2022. He got into just 15 games with Houston, hitting a dismal .116/.156/.163 and striking out in 51.1% of his plate appearances. He was optioned to the minors and has been dealing with injuries ever since, only getting into 20 minor league games on the year. With active rosters expanding for September, the Astros decided to call up prospects Hunter Brown and Yainer Diaz, bumping Goodrum from the roster in the process.\nGoodrum has more than three years of MLB service time, meaning that he would have been able to reject an outright assignment and elect free agency. However, only players with more than five years&#8217; service time can do so while retaining the salary they are owed. That could have led to him accepting an assignment to stick with the Space Cowboys, though it now seems to be a moot point. With the club releasing him, they will be on the hook for the approximately $400K left on the deal, while Goodrum will return to the open market and look for his next opportunity.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/red-sox-to-promote-triston-casas.html",
        "description": "TODAY: Casas&#8217; promotion was officially announced, with the Red Sox also calling up Josh Winckowski from Triple-A.  Houck was indeed moved to the 60-day IL, Dalbec was optioned to Triple-A, and right-hander Kutter Crawford was placed on the 15-day injured list with a right shoulder impingement.  Crawford was supposed to start today&#8217;s game against the Rangers but Sox manager Alex Cora said yesterday that the righty would be scratched.  Winckowski will instead make today&#8217;s start.\nSEPTEMBER 3: The Red Sox are going to add first base prospect Triston Casas to the team tomorrow, according to Chris Cotillo of MassLive. That report has been confirmed by Julian McWilliams of the Boston Globe, who adds that Bobby Dalbec will be optioned to Triple-A Worcester. Casas is not currently on the club&#8217;s 40-man roster, meaning they will have to open a spot for him. However, it would likely come down to transferring someone to the 60-day IL, such as Tanner Houck, who was previously reported to be done for the season.\nCasas, 22, was selected by Boston in the first round of the 208 draft, 26th overall. He got a brief showing in rookie ball that year and jumped to A-ball to start 2019. He hit 19 home runs for the Greenville Drive while slashing .254/.349/.472, producing a wRC+ of 136 and earning a brief promotion to High-A to finish the year.\n\nAfter that strong showing in his first full season as a professional, he was ranked the #70 prospect in the sport by Baseball America. Of course, the minor league seasons were canceled that year by the pandemic, preventing Casas from playing organized ball that season. In 2021, he split his time between Double-A and Triple-A, hitting 14 homers and slashing .279/.394/.484. He walked in 15.4% of his plate appearances while striking out in just 19.1% of them, producing a wRC+ of 141.\nAfter that excellent season, he jumped up to #19 on BA&#8217;s 2022 top prospects list and seemed a candidate to make his major league debut this season. The Red Sox stuck with Dalbec as their first baseman to start the year and Casas was taken off the table when he suffered an ankle injury in May, returning to Worcester at the end of July. In Triple-A this year, he&#8217;s hit .273/.382/.481 for a wRC+ of 127, walking in 14.5% of his trips to the plate while going down on strikes just 21.5% of the time. He&#8217;s currently ranked as the #28 prospect in the league by Baseball America, #14 by FanGraphs and #31 by Keith Law of The Athletic.\nFans of the Red Sox have been calling for this move for some time, not just because of the strong showing of Casas, but also the struggles of Dalbec. After hitting 25 home runs last year and slashing .240/.298/.494 for a wRC+ of 107, he&#8217;s slumped this year to a showing of .211/.282/.363. That production is 22% below league average, as evidenced by his 78 wRC+. Based on those disappointing results, he and Casas will switch places, with Dalbec going down to the minors to try to get back on track.\nThe Red Sox are seven games behind the Blue Jays for the final Wild Card spot in the American League with three teams in between, making it very difficult for them to make a serious playoff run over the final month of the season. Regardless, they will give Casas a look over the remainder of the campaign to see how he fares against big league pitching in the next few weeks and hopefully go into the winter with some momentum towards next season. Eric Hosmer was acquired from the Padres at the trade deadline but is currently on the IL. Assuming Casas shows well enough to earn himself regular playing time, the club will have to figure out how to balance having both on the team.\nWith only a few weeks to go until the offseason, it&#8217;s unlikely that Casas will reach 130 at-bats here in 2022, meaning he will hang onto his rookie/prospect status through the winter. That&#8217;s a potentially important note under the new collective bargaining agreement. Players with less than 60 days of service who appear among two preseason Top 100 lists at Baseball America, ESPN or MLB Pipeline can net their team a bonus amateur draft choice based on their early-career finishes in awards voting, so long as their club carries them on the MLB roster for a full service year. If Casas cracks next year&#8217;s Opening Day roster and sticks around all season, and he wins a Rookie of the Year or places highly in MVP balloting during his first couple seasons, the club could pick up an extra draft choice down the line.\nImage courtesy of USA Today Sports.",

In case you can’t see the embedded tweet videos, they show home runs from Nick Pratto, Bobby Witt Jr., MJ Melendez, and Kyle Isbel. Every home run was hit by a Royals rookie. Kyle Isbel’s homer doubled as the first Royals’ grand slam of the season.\nIf only someone had written about how the team has been hitting better thanks to a new organizational hitting philosophy, we might have seen this coming.\nEvery Royals’ starter had at least one hit. Four players, all rookies, had multiple RBIs. Nate Eaton had his first career four-hit game, including a two-RBI double and a triple. The Royals took the lead in the bottom of the first, gave it up in the second, took it back in the third, and never let Detroit get close again.\nJonathan Heasley, after I suggested he didn’t deserve a roster spot, made easily his best start of the season. He went seven innings and allowed two runs while striking out two, walking two, and giving up eight hits. There’s no arguing with the results, but the lack of swing-and-miss stuff and the number of baserunners suggest that he may not have been as dominant as he first appears. Wyatt Mills came on in relief and finished off the final two innings of the game with a trio of strikeouts and a hit batter.\nNotes\n\nBobby Witt Jr’s home run put him in the 20-20 club; 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases. It’s a reasonably impressive milestone.\nKyle Isbel’s home run looked like a wall scraper in the rightfield corner, but according to the broadcast, it was a home run in 28 of 30 parks.\nSpeaking of Isbel, he has struggled with the bat this year but since the start of August - coinciding with more frequent starts - he’s been hitting above average by FanGraphs’ wRC+ stat and tonight did nothing to change that.\nNate Eaton, after playing far more games at third in the minors than the outfield, finally got his first work at third base at the major league level when he took over for Hunter Dozier in the ninth. He caught a popup with no issues.\nVinnie Pasquantino started his rehab assignment in AAA tonight, nine days after suffering his injury; it shouldn’t take him long to get back into the lineup.\n\nThe Royals will go for the series victory tomorrow afternoon at 12:40 CDT. Max Castillo will make his second start with the Royals after being called up following the waiving of Daniel Mengden. The Tigers will send right-hander Matt Manning to the mound.",

        "description": "Rich Storry-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  New York got just one hit outside of their MVP frontrunner and their AL East lead now sits at a mere four games. Aaron Judge homered and the Yankees’ pitching was pretty good, but the offense was a no-show. Tell me if you’ve seen this movie before.\nThere were not a lot of good things to say about this New York ballclub heading into Saturday night’s game, and somehow, even with an extremely pessimistic expectation entering play, the Yankees continue to find ways to disappoint and dig themselves a deeper hole. They mustered just one hit outside of Judge in a 2-1 loss that brought the Rays to within four games in the AL East.\nThe clubhouse morale is shot, and it has to be affecting play at this point in time. There isn’t any other way to put it. The non-Judge hitters can’t buy a run to save their life, and though No. 99 can be as menacing as he wants, if no one else in the lineup steps up to provide a real threat, no one is going to pitch to the man with 52 bombs on the year.\nFriday’s final score of 9-0 doesn’t reflect well on the pitching staff, but six of those runs were scored very late off a journeyman who is no longer with the team. As a whole, it is getting frustrating for starters and relievers to put up valiant efforts that ultimately end up useless, as the offense is simply folding in every single inning. Judge’s bomb in the ninth snapped a streak of 21 consecutive scoreless frames dating back to Wednesday in Anaheim. Jarringly, it was the third time since the beginning of August that they’ve been blanked in at least 19 innings in a row.\nCorey Kluber took the ball against his old team for the fourth time this season. The general theory is that the more times an offense sees a pitcher, it’s likelier to do damage off him. Familiarity usually favors the hitters, but you would never guess that looking at Kluber and the Yankees’ lineup.\nKluber had a 1.50 ERA in 18 innings against his 2021 club this season; he twirled three quality starts, going six apiece in each of them, and tonight, he delivered his best effort of those four games (and one of his better lines of 2022). The two-time Cy Young Award winner tossed seven frames of stress-free ball, needing only 88 pitches to complete his outing, allowing only a couple of hits and no runs with four punchouts and zero free passes.\n\nKluber messed around with his arsenal for tonight’s game, as he threw his sinker 42 percent of the time with plenty of success earning 13 called strikes on the pitch. For context, Kluber has thrown his sinker just 26.8 percent of the time over the whole season.\nThe brutal reality is that looking at the lineup tonight, you can talk all you want about how the team got here, and what was being done during the peak months of the season, but if you remove Judge, the highest OPS on the team for the 2022 campaign is Giancarlo Stanton’s at a now-underwhelming .768 mark. Almost all of that was compiled before the former MVP’s mid-July injury too, as he has been anemic since returning from the IL.\nIt goes beyond Stanton, too, of course. DJ LeMahieu’s numbers continue to plummet as he barrels through a lingering injury. Josh Donaldson remains massively underwhelming on the offensive side, and for all he’s done well this season, Gleyber Torres’ total production doesn’t indicate much more than a league-average-ish bat, and that’s not cutting it from a bat-first player. Even the promising rookies went hitless in this one, as Oswald Peraza and Oswaldo Cabrera took oh-fers.\nAs The Athletic’s Lindsey Adler noted on Twitter, it’s just all been so bleak — especially over the past month:\n\n\nIf I have done my math correctly (very possible I have not), then the Yankees as a team excluding Aaron Judge hit .206/.268/.295 over the last 30 days.— Lindsey Adler (@lindseyadler) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Rays didn’t even do much to deserve this game beyond Kluber’s effort. They scored two runs off Clarke Schmidt in the third that ended up being the difference, which took a friendly bounce off Schmidt’s foot to make it happen. They then completely butchered a baserunning play in the seventh inning, when Taylor Walls doubled off the wall with two runners on, and Francisco Méjia was caught looking at something that no one knows and failed to score from second, somehow getting caught in a rundown.\nSchmidt, Lou Trivino, Ron Marinaccio, and Jonathan Loáisiga did yeoman’s work to hold the Rays to two runs on the night, and while that play kept the score close, it wasn’t close enough for a dead-in-the-water offense to even tie it up.\nAs previously noted, Judge came up to bat in the top of the ninth inning and got one home run closer to history with his 52nd bomb of the year.\n\nThat tied Judge’s career-high from his sensational 2017 and actually put him one ahead of Roger Maris’ pace from 1961. It was also his 210th in pinstripes, putting him 12th in Yankees history.\nSadly, the Judge homer came while he was leading off the inning, and it only prevented the shutout before Jason Adam wrapped it up. Tampa secured the 2-1 win and will go for the gut-punch sweep tomorrow afternoon at 1:40pm with Frankie Montas facing opener Shawn Armstrong.\nBox Score",

        "description": "Photo by Duane Burleson/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Other than Ryan Kreidler’s first two major league hits, this was another ugly watch. Outside of Ryan Kreidler’s first major league hit, this was pretty much another atrocious game all around. Michael Pineda was awful, as was the bullpen, as the offense did little to help matters as the Kansas City Royals evened the series at a game apiece by trouncing the Tigers 12-2\nRight from the start, Pineda had trouble locating anything consistently. Already confined to being a nibbler due to sub-par stuff, the right-hander didn’t spot his fastball well and the Royals had little trouble teeing off on him. Nick Pratto lifted a solo shot to left in the first inning, setting the tone for this one.\nThe Tigers had a chance to even the score when Riley Greene led off the bottom half of the first with a single. Willi Castro grounded into a force at second, taking first base and moving to second on a Javier Báez single. However, Harold Castro flew out, and Kerry Carpenter’s bliner off the label was handled by Bobby Witt Jr. at shortstop.\nPineda was better in the second inning, closing it with a three pitch dusting of Nate Eaton, and the Tigers did briefly tie things up. With one out, Spencer Torkelson drew a four-pitch walk and moved to third when Tucker Barnhart pulled a drive into the right field corner, sliding in just in the nick of time as Eaton whirled and threw a perfect strike to second base. Ryan Kreidler hit a fly ball into the left center field gap that was caught, but Torkelson scored with no trouble from third. That was Kreidler’s first RBI. There would be more firsts to come.\n\n\nThe corner isn’t too hot for @Ryan_Kreidler. pic.twitter.com/rGqldpg2qC— Detroit Tigers (@tigers) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the rally died there as Riley Greene grounded out first pitch to end the inning.\nThe wheels came off in the third for Pineda. Nicky Lopez got a first pitch meatball and ripped it to the wall in center field for a triple. Pineda walked MJ Melendez, who then stole second base on Pineda. That brought Witt to the dish, and in a 3-2 count he got a fastball and smoked it to left for a three-run shot. Pineda continued to struggle with location but managed to retire the next three in order.\nIn the fourth, Pineda got the first two outs and then fell apart as Eaton singled to left and stole second. Nicky Lopez drew a walk, and Melendez pulled a ground ball into right field to score Eaton. 5-1 Royals. Pineda’s pitch count was already deep into the 70’s, so he wasn’t going much further.\nMeanwhile the third and fourth innings were quick ones for the Tigers’ offense against a pretty lackluster starter in Jonathan Heasley. \nJason Foley took over in the fifth and put together his worst outing of the year. Nick Pratto, Michael A. Taylor and Ryan O’Hearn all singled before Foley got the first out, striking out Hunter Dozier. Foley tried to start Kyle Isbel out with a first pitch slider, and Isbel smoked a line shot over the wall in the right field corner for a grand slam. 9-1 Royals. Daniel Norris took over and cleaned up the rest of the inning without much incident.\nThe home run was the first Foley had allowed since Mitch Haniger of the Seattle Mariners took him deep on June 10, 2021. \nSpeaking of rarities, Tucker Barnhart led off the bottom half of the fifth with a solo shot for his first home run of the season. Ryan Kreidler followed with a swinging bunt to Dozier at third, and he couldn’t quite get the handle on the ball. Not the most impressive first major league hit ever, but no doubt Kreidler will take it. Unfortunately it didn’t lead to any runs.\n\n\nHe'll remember this one! It's the 1st home run of the season for @tigers catcher @Tucker_Barnhart, helping to cut the deficit here in the 5th. #DetroitRoots pic.twitter.com/47Dy3VOdiM— Bally Sports Detroit (@BallySportsDET) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nSave that baseball, @Ryan_Kreidler. pic.twitter.com/6sZtqsrpUl— Detroit Tigers (@tigers) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nMelendez greeted Norris with a solo shot in the top of the sixth to make it 10-2. Carpenter led off the bottom half with a single, but was stranded as Jeimer Candelario, the designated hitter with Kreidler at third, lined out and Torkelson grounded into a double play. Can’t say anything at all looks different in Torkelson’s setup and swing, by the way. Still whiffing or popping up fastballs right down the middle. Not good.\nBáez exited the game, probably just as a precaution as his glove hand had been clipped on a tag play at second earlier in the night. He’d stayed in the game, but with it long out of reach, AJ Hinch moved Kreidler to his natural position at shortstop, and Kody Clemens took over at third. Norris didn’t put them to work, allowing a Dozier double, wild pitching him to third, walking Isbel, and then allowing a double to left off the bat of Eaton. 12-2 Royals.\nIn the bottom half, Barnhart led off with a walk, putting together his best offensive performance of the year by far in a complete lost cause of a game. Kreidler followed with a single to right field for his second major league hit. Greene, having a brutal night at the plate, whiffed over a changeup to strike out on three pitches, while Willi Castro and Clemens flew out routinely. \nJose Cisnero took over from Norris in the top of the eighth and struck out a pair after a one-out walk to Pratto. His velocity was up to 95-96 consistently in this one, which was nice to see after shoulder issues cost him most of the season.\nThe Tigers went quickly in the bottom half, while Kody Clemens came in to pitch the top of the ninth, allowing an Eaton triple but no more.\nTorkelson was hit by a pitch to open the ninth, but the Tigers went in order with Akil Baddoo pinch-hitting for Greene with two outs and striking out to mercifully end this one.\nNotes\nMiguel Cabrera’s strained left biceps will send him to the injured list. Apparently the Tigers want him back this year for some unfathomable reason, per AJ Hinch. \nJosh Lester will be called up for a well deserved cup of coffee and should get some days in the DH spot. Lester is highly unlikely to do much of anything, but he’s been a good soldier on the farm for years and has had a good season powering the Toledo Mud Hens’ offense.\n\n\nMiguel Cabrera is going on the IL with a left biceps strain. He’s expected to miss 10-14 days but the Tigers want him back this year, A.J. Hinch said.Josh Lester will be called up.— Cody Stavenhagen (@CodyStavenhagen) September 4, 2022",

        "description": "TODAY: Cabrera was officially placed on the 10-day IL, retroactive to September 3.  Lester&#8217;s contract was selected from Triple-A, and Meadows was moved to the 60-day IL to open up a 40-man roster spot.\nSEPTEMBER 3: After tonight&#8217;s game, Tigers manager A.J. Hinch told reporters that the club is going to place Miguel Cabrera on the 10-day injured list with a left biceps strain. Cody Stavenhagen of The Athletic was among those to relay the news on Twitter. Infielder/outfielder Josh Lester will be called up to take his place on the active roster. Lester isn&#8217;t currently on the club&#8217;s 40-man roster, meaning a corresponding move of some kind will be required to make room for him. That might be as simple as transferring Austin Meadows to the 60-day IL, after he announced that he will miss the remainder of the season.\nHinch says that Cabrera will miss 10-14 days but that they want to get him back to the club this year. That doesn&#8217;t leave them with a huge window, as there&#8217;s just over four weeks remaining in the season at this point. However, the club is well out of contention at this point, meaning they could probably bring Cabrera without a rehab assignment for a few at-bats if he&#8217;s able to get his strain under control by early October. The 39-year-old is in the penultimate season of the extension he signed with the club in 2014.\nLester, 28, was a 13th-round draft pick of the Tigers back in 2015. That means he is currently in his seventh minor league season, which would have been his eighth if not for the pandemic wiping out the minors in 2020. He&#8217;s never been listed as one of the club&#8217;s top prospects at Baseball America or FanGraphs but has earned his way up to the big leagues with a solid showing here in 2022. In 124 Triple-A games on the season, he&#8217;s hit 24 home runs and is slashing .242/.304/.469. He&#8217;ll be making his MLB debut as soon as he gets into a game.",

        "description": "Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Max Scherzer left the game after five good innings, Adam Ottavino looked human for the first time in a long time, and the Mets offense was nowhere to be found, as the Mets dropped an overall frustrating game. You can file virtually every part of this game under “that is not what you want”.\nMax Scherzer, who has been trying to get his 200th career win with the same success rate as the Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae, took the mound against his former franchise in the Washington Nationals and looked like his typical Max Scherzer-ian self, save for surrendering a solo home run in the first inning to Luis García. He did, however, see his night end early due to “feeling fatigued on his left side” according to the SNY broadcast, which is extremely not what you would like to see, considering he missed two months with an oblique injury on that same side. \nOffensively, the Mets were nothing short of dreadful. They amassed just four hits and one run against the ghost of Patrick Corbin — who, in fairness to the lefty, looked like his old self tonight. The one run came off the bat of Eduardo Escobar, who hit yet another home run, this time in the third inning, as the switch hitter is starting to heat up a bit as we march towards the end of the season.\nThe Nationals broke the 1-1 tie in the eighth inning, when Lane Thomas took a very, very poorly located Adam Ottavino slider over the left field fence. Ottavino kept the damage to just that, but looked human for the first time in a long time.\nThe Mets had a chance to pick Ottavino up in the eighth, facing Carl Edwards Jr. Nimmo beat out a would-be double play and Marte hit a perfectly placed infield single to put two runners on with two outs, but Francisco Lindor popped up a 2-0 fastball to end the rally. \nBuck Showalter inexplicably brought Adonis Medina in for the ninth, and promptly surrendered five runs (one due to a Jeff McNeil error) to put this game to bed. On a brighter note, Bryce Montes de Oca, who has battled some serious injuries in his career, made his major league debut in relief of Medina and stopped the bleeding.\nBox scores\nMLBESPN\nSB Nation GameThreads\nAmazin’ AvenueFederal Baseball\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      fangraphs.com\n  \nBig Mets winner: Eduardo Escobar, +21.3% WPABig Mets loser: Adam Ottavino, -22.4% WPAMets pitchers: -8.0% WPAMets hitters: -42.0% WPATeh aw3s0mest play: Eduardo Escobar’s third inning home run, +13.4% WPATeh sux0rest play: Lane Thomas’s eighth inning home run, -29.2% WPA",

        "description": "South Bend Cubs\n    \n\n  South Bend loses, clinches a division title anyway.  South Bend clinched a second-half title as they shoot for back-to-back Midwest League titles. (They won the Midwest League in 2019—which was the most-recent year of the Midwest League.) Unfortunately, they clinched despite a loss. \nWe’ve got a short schedule tonight.\nIowa Cubs\nRained out in Columbus. Doubleheader Sunday.\nTennessee Smokies\nRained out at Mississippi. Doubleheader Sunday\nSouth Bend Cubs\nThe South Bend Cubs were hammered by the Lansing Lugnuts (Athletics), 10-8. However, the Quad Cities River Bandits beat the Beloit Sky Carp 5-1, which clinched the second-half divisional title for South Bend.\nStarter Richard Gallardo took the loss after giving up eight runs on six hits over three innings. However, all five runs Gallardo gave up in the second inning were unearned thanks to two South Bend errors. Gallardo walked three and struck out two.\nFirst baseman B.J. Murray Jr. hit a solo home run in the sixth inning which was his fifth home run with South Bend this year and eighth overall. Murray was 1 for 4 with a walk.\nSecond baseman Yeison Santana went 2 for 4 with a walk. He scored twice and had two RBI.\nDH Jordan Nwogu was 2 for 5 with an RBI triple in the third inning. He also had an RBI groundout later to drive in his second run of the game.\nAfter trailing in this game 8-1 at one point, South Bend had their own “Mighty Casey” moment when center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong came up to bat as the winning run in the bottom of the ninth. However, like Casey, Crow-Armstrong struck out to end the game. But Crow-Armstrong did have a good game anyway, going 2 for 5 with a double and one run scored. \nMyrtle Beach Pelicans\nThe Myrtle Beach Pelicans were bitten by the Charleston RiverDogs (Rays), 7-5.\nPelicans starter Didier Vargas gave up four home runs in six innings tonight. But all four of them were solo home runs. so at least he limited the damage. Vargas’ final line was four runs on four hits over six innings. Vargas struck out seven and walked no one, so that helped.\nThe loss went to Anthony Mendez, who threw the final three innings. Vargas allowed three runs on three hits, including a two-run home run. One of the three runs was unearned. Mendez struck out one, walked two and hit one batter.\nThe RiverDogs hit five home runs. The Pelicans had six hits and they were all singles.\nSecond baseman Pedro Ramirez went 2 for 4 and scored twice.\nRight fielder Ezequiel Pagan was 2 for 3 with a walk. Pagan had two RBI.\nDH Moises Ballesteros was 1 for 3 with a sacrifice fly and two total RBI.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/braves-sign-jake-marisnick-to-minor-league-deal.html",
        "description": "The Braves signed outfielder Jake Marisnick to a minor league deal, according to his transactions tracker at MLB.com. The deal is listed as taking place on August 30, which is significant as 11:59pm ET on August 31 was the postseason eligibility cutoff. Those within an organization but not on the 40-man at the start of September can still be added to the postseason roster to replace a player on the injured list via petition to the commissioner’s office.\nMarisnick, 31, is in his 10th MLB season, having seen action with the Marlins, Astros, Mets, Cubs, Padres and Pirates. He&#8217;s never been a huge threat at the plate, as evidenced by his career slash line of .234/.272/.390. That amounts to a wRC+ of 81, or 19% below league average. However, he has always provided speed and defense, stealing 79 bases and 76 Defensive Runs Saved over his time in the big leagues.\nThis year, he signed a minor league deal with the Rangers in March but jumped ship to the Pirates as the season was beginning. About five weeks into the season, he required thumb surgery which kept him out of action for about two months. He was released in early August after appearing in just 31 total games for the Bucs on the year. He hit about at his career rate in that time but accrued six Outs Above Average.\nThe Braves have young superstar Ronald Acuna Jr. on the roster, though he&#8217;s been spending a lot of time at designated hitter due to lingering soreness in his return from tearing his ACL last year. That leaves the club with an outfield mix of Michael Harris II, Eddie Rosario, Robbie Grossman, Marcell Ozuna and Guillermo Heredia. Outside of Harris, none of that group is having a very good season. Should the club decide they want to bring up a glove-first option into the mix, they&#8217;ll have Marisnick on hand in the minors.",

        "description": "Photo by Adam Hagy/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Braves use a strong start from rookie Bryce Elder and a, solo home run from Austin Riley, and a walk-off walk to down Marlins. In a game that turned interesting late, the Braves used a strong start from Bryce Elder, a solo homer from Austin Riley, and a walk-off walk from Robbie Grossman to outlast Miami 2-1.\nElder, starting his second game since the All-Star break, and both against the lowly Marlins, pitched a strong six innings, only allowing 2 hits and 2 walks and striking out 6 in a scoreless outing.\nThe only scoring through the first 8 innings happened in the 4th, when Austin Riley launched a 1-2 slider for a rocket home run down the left-field line, his 35th of the season, and gave the Braves a 1-0 lead. \n\n\nYour daily @austinriley1308 home run highlight!  #ForTheA pic.twitter.com/c2FGzxVwFl— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThe bullpen followed it up Elder’s solid outing with a perfect inning from AJ Minter in the seventh, and a scoreless frame from Rasiel Iglesias in the eighth, and it looked liked the Braves were going get out of the game with that same 1-0 lead.\nUnfortunately, the rough adventures of Kenley Jansen continued tonight after he gave up a single, single and a walk to start the ninth. That was followed by a sacrifice fly to tie the score at 1-1, and gave Jansen his sixth blown save of the season, his most since 2019 when he had eight with the Dodgers.\nJansen recored one more out, and then after a lengthy delay due to an injury to the home plate umpire, Tyler Matzek was brought in the finish off the ninth, which he did in one pitch.\nIn the bottom half, Matt Olson started the inning off with a line drive single, followed by opposite field double from Michael Harris II. Miami then automatically walked Vaughn Grissom to load the bases with one out. Travis d’Arnaud lined out to the third base, bringing Robbie Grossman to the plate:\n\n\nWalk it off! (literally)#ForTheA pic.twitter.com/x9XWOoV9O7— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nMatzek picked up the shortest win of his or anyone’s career.\nThe walk-off improved the Braves record to 83-51 on the season and picked them up a game in the NL East after the Mets lost earlier in the night. Their division deficit now sits at 2 games and the Braves will look for their 5th win in a row and a sweep of Miami in Sunday’s series finale. Max Fried will start Sunday against Pablo Lopez.",

So the perfect game was out of the question, but he had faced just 25 batters with one of the walks erased by a double play.\nA no-no? With this low a pitch count and Dylan coaxing some weak swings from Minnesota rather than running up tons of pitches with many Ks, entirely possible.\n\n\nAnd just like that I’m sucked right back in lmaoooo this #WhiteSox team is something else— Liddle Tina (@liddle_ktina) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Twins suck.

        "description": "Mountcastle and Mullins celebrate Mountcastle’s first home run of the night.  | Photo by Mitchell Layton/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Yes! More winning!  That was fun!\nThe Orioles dominated the Athletics with the long ball tonight, making up for some shaky starting pitching to clinch the series and do what a good team should do to a bad team. The end result was a 8-1 win that put the Orioles 10 games over .500 and allowed them to keep pace with their wild card rivals.\nIt was not only great to see the Orioles put up such a good win, it was great to see it done with so many possible pieces of the Orioles future. The lineup featured the first three draft picks from 2019 in Adley Rutschman, Gunnar Henderson, and Kyle Stowers. Fellow highly rated prospect D.L. Hall joined them in the eighth inning to make his Camden Yards (and relief pitching) debut. \nFor as great as the game was, the first inning wasn’t very reassuring. Starting pitcher Austin Voth had a rough go of things, needing 30 pitches to get out of the inning. Trouble started with back-to-back singles, then a sac fly gave the A’s a 1-0 lead. That lead would not last long. \nVoth didn’t allow another baserunner in the first, but he threw a ton  of pitches. He struck out the final two batters but needed 16 pitches to do so. That’s a lot of throwing for one inning! \nLuckily the Orioles didn’t even have to wait a full inning to take a lead they would not relinquish. In the bottom of the first, Cedric Mullins walked and then jogged home ahead of Ryan Mountcastle’s 20th home run of the year. It was an absolute blast over Mt. Walltimore that traveled 415 feet. \n\n\nRyan Mountcastle's 20th HR was DESTROYED. pic.twitter.com/tClIlKbxhc— MLB (@MLB) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nWe didn’t know it at the time, but those were the only runs the Orioles needed to win this game. But they did not stop there. Not even close. \nMountcastle, who has been heating up nicely over the past few weeks, wasn’t finished. In the third inning, this time with Anthony Santandar on base from a walk, Mountcastle went the other way, this time to the center field seats. His 21st home run went “just” 409 feet. \nThe homer parade continued in the fourth inning but not from Mountcastle. He flew out. But Cedric Mullins did not. His big fly landed on the flag court. Santander’s home run in the same inning went to right-center. \nIt should have been an easy night for even a starting pitcher without his best stuff to cruise to at least five innings, but that wasn’t the case for Voth. After his laborious first inning, he bounced back for the second and third innings, but fell apart in the top of the fourth when the score was still 4-1. \nThree straight singles started off Voth’s fourth inning to load the bases, putting the Orioles into potentially big trouble. The go-ahead run was at the plate in the form of Nick Allen, who hit a laser to Stowers in right field. Stowers made the play and fired the ball back into the infield. In his exuberance he missed the cutoff man, the catcher, and the player backing up the catcher. Luckily the ball took a good bounce off of the wall behind home and the runner at third was not able to score. \nAfter three singles and a loud out from Voth, it was time for him to go. It was the first time he hadn’t completed at least five innings since July 25th. \nManager Brandon Hyde turned to relief pitcher Keegan Akin, and I admit I was worried. Akin didn’t assuage my fears when he went to a 3-1 count on his first batter. I thought for sure he’d walk in a run. But he did not, happily. Instead he got the best play he could hope for: an inning-ending double play. It was a nifty one too, which is something we Orioles fans have been spoiled with this year. \nIf there was one letdown in this game, for me, it’s the number of pitchers who had to be used in what ended up being an 8-1 Orioles win. In addition to Akin, the Orioles used pitchers Joey Krehbiel, Cionel Perez, D.L. Hall, and Nick Vespi. I know that other than Perez they didn’t use the A team, but that’s still a lot of relievers. \nThat being said, they were outstanding. There was a bit of an issue when Krehbiel allowed two runners to reach base in the seventh inning, but Perez was called in to shut the door and he did just that. After a ground out that should have been a double play if not for a misplay from Rougned Odor (they only got one), Mullins made an outstanding catch to save the day. \n\n\nCedric Mullins has made a lot of tough catches look easy this season.This was not one, but he went out and got it anyway. pic.twitter.com/vK9TPXXxk0— Zachary Silver (@zachsilver) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nAside from that, the relief was incredible. Akin, Perez, and Hall didn’t allow a hit in their appearances. Hall, making his relief debut, had a 1-2-3 inning with two swinging strikeouts. He touched 98 on the radar gun several times. Welcome back and keep it up, D.L.\nBut back to the most exciting part of the day, the offense. The only non-homer run scored came in sixth inning, and it came thanks to speed. Jorge Mateo reached on an infield single that some of the armchair umpires on Twitter were adamant it should have been an error. Mateo stole second base and moved to third when the throw bounced into the outfield. \nWith a runner just 90 feet away, Rutschman had an extended at bat. It took him nine pitches, but he lined a ball right back up the middle to plate Mateo. The ball ricocheted off of the leg of A’s pitcher Zach Logue, but thankfully Logue seemed ok. \nNot happy with just an RBI single, Rutschman joined the dinger club in the bottom of the eighth. His home run traveled to the center field seats as well, his ninth of the year. That gave pitcher Nick Vespi more run support than he needed to close out ninth inning and get the win. He did so easily, working around a one-out single to close things out. \nOrioles win! Tomorrow they will go for the sweep and hopefully, finally make some headway in the wild card race. \nOh, one more thing. I barely mentioned Gunnar Henderson in this story! Gunnar wasn’t involved in any of the run scoring action, but he did reach base twice with a single and a walk. But his most impressive hit was ruled foul. Check this out:\n\n\nThis ball was ruled foul but...holy hell was this thing CLOBBERED by Gunnar Henderson pic.twitter.com/vLVaVyYYWG— Alex Fast (@AlexFast8) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThat ball was hit 108 mph and projected to go about 409 feet. One person on Twitter who may or may not be trustworthy said that it one-hopped the warehouse. Just incredible. I look forward to his many Eutaw Street blasts.",

        "description": "Grant us copulating progress! (LFG)\n    \n\n  Permit us to fornicatingly abscond! (Let’s fucking go!) Happy Saturday, White Sox fans, and Happy Dylan Cease One-Hitter Day! \nOur magnificent ace was unstoppable tonight, and with the help of adequate run support from every single bat in the lineup, he helped to propel the White Sox into a tie with the Twins for second place, in this eternally-lengthy AL Central race. \nCease came in with an uncharacteristically low number of strikeouts in early innings, and dominated through every at-bat, giving up two walks and one hit in a nearly-flawless, stunning shutout. This was Cease’s second career complete game, and all of our buttholes unclenched in defeat when he gave up the only hit in the ninth inning to Luis Arráez, who would have been the final out if Cease had completed the no-hitter.\n  \n        \n      No hitter dreams: texts with my dad, with whom I’ve shared many historic White Sox games. \n  \nSouth Siders everywhere may agree that tonight’s game breathed new life into frustrated fans. The White Sox offense grabbed the reins immediately and stayed sharp throughout, serving some seriously essential serotonin. Everyone in the lineup had a hand in dominating the Twins, with some key players shining at the right times. \nAfter a José Abreu RBI single, Eloy Jiménez hit a three-run blast to give the White Sox a quad in the first for an early lead. Behind Cease’s commanding performance, insurance runs weren’t needed — but they were produced. \n\n\nA no-doubter from Eloy Jiménez! pic.twitter.com/ZX5xBnLNLN— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nRomy González, who had 24 home runs in the minors last year, celebrated his first major league home run with a three-run blast in the fourth inning, Chicago’s second three-pack of the game. \n\n\nFirst major league homer for Romy González! pic.twitter.com/ljflFfJlWu— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nWith multiple home runs in three of their last four games, the White Sox have been looking like everyone thought they would at the very start of this season. Injuries happen, and may be unavoidable (unless you have a Herm Schneider, but I digress), but there’s an undeniable difference in this team over the last several games. With pieces of that ideal team shining through, we’re winning more games, and in a far more dramatic fashion.\nSpeaking of dramatic, Seby Zavala was the only dead bat on the White Sox offense — until his eighth-inning, two-run blast, but his performance behind the plate would have more than sufficed unaccompanied by offense. One could argue that hitting a home run off of utility player Nick Gordon isn’t all that special, but if that’s true, then why did 20,000 White Sox fans get a simultaneous boner when this happened?\n\n\nElvis Andrus with a grand slam off of Twins utility guy Nick Gordon pic.twitter.com/2muJUzf4Jw— Talkin’ Baseball (@TalkinBaseball_) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nMany fans are certain about what’s responsible for changing the tune of this freshly assertive White Sox team, and the simplest answer is usually the correct one. Miguel Cairo, acting manager over the last five games in Tony La Russa’s mysterious medical absence, likely has something to do with the South Siders winning their last four outings. Given the irrefutably pickled-brain La Russa moves, it seems like the correct conclusion. What is Cairo doing right?\nThe better question may be: What isn’t he doing right? Good calls, grounded batting orders, and old-fashioned common sense seem to be working well for the White Sox. Support from leadership is sure to play a part, as one may question whether or not La Russa would have pulled Cease prematurely tonight during his one-hitter, were he acting as manager. \nThe current acting manager proved he wasn’t a buttoned-up bore last night, when Twins pitchers beaned enough White Sox to build a seven-layer dip, and a riled Cairo joined the South Siders in a bench-clearing protest. Can Cairo be behind the reason Josh Harrison had a smile painted on his face in every hit-and-run tonight, why Eloy looks confident, and why AJ Pollock has a six-game hitting streak?\nThe White Sox are now 67-66, and have a chance to run this race to the very end if they keep the momentum going. A Twins sweep tomorrow can put the South Siders in a position to take advantage of the Guardians’ four-game losing skid, and extend their own winning streak to five. This lights-out Cease performance and explosive offensive glory grab has the potential to propel the White Sox into the team everyone projected them to be this year, and just in the nick of time. \nLet’s fucking go.",

        "description": "Photo by Chase Agnello-Dean/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Dylan Cease was a Luis Arráez single away from a no-hitter and this was over early Normally, I would try to give you some analysis and insights about the game we just watched. But, tonight, there’s not much point in that. The Twins were utterly dominated and put forth an embarrassing performance. All you really need to know is that American League Cy Young front-runner Dylan Cease was in complete control from the start, the beleaguered Twins lineup had little chance throughout, and Tyler Mahle’s shoulder issues are not resolved. If not for Luis Arráez knocking a line-drive single with two outs in the top of the 9th, Cease would have thrown (at least what felt like) one of the least competitive no-hitters in baseball history.\n  \n        \n      Courtesy of FanGraphs\n  \nInstead, Cease finished with a complete game shutout on just 103 pitches, allowing the lone hit and two walks, to go along with a middling (for him) 7 strikeouts. The Twins put twenty batted balls in play tonight and none of them qualified as barrels. Six were hit 95 mph or greater, but the Twins rarely threatened to get a hit, and the White Sox did not need to make any superior defensive plays to preserve Cease’s no-hit bid.\nThe other major storyline from this one is Tyler Mahle’s shoulder. The Twins activated Mahle off the injured list to start tonight, but he never looked right. In the bottom of the first, the first four Chicago hitters reached on three straight singles and a three-run home run off the bat of Eloy Jiménez. That put the Twins in a 4-0 hole before Mahle even recorded an out. He’d put down the next three hitters in order, but when he returned for the bottom of the 2nd inning, his velocity was again alarmingly low. Despite a fastball that was sitting 87-88 mph that inning, Mahle put up a zero. He was replaced by Aaron Sanchez in the third and the Twins later announced that Mahle is again dealing with shoulder inflammation.\nSanchez did an admirable job in long relief. He did allow a three-run homer in the 4th that effectively ended the game, but otherwise soaked up five innings and saved the rest of the bullpen for another day. The homer was hit by Chicago 9-hole hitter Romy González and was the very first of his major league career.\n\nAnother feature of this game that is worth noting is that Rocco Baldelli pulled his #2 and #3 hitters, Carlos Correa and Max Kepler, in the bottom of the fifth trailing 7-0. Per Megan Ryan, this was a “manager’s decision,” not anything injury-related. There’s probably no story there and was just Rocco getting two of his core players a little rest in a non-competitive game in the midst of a long stretch with few off days, but it was a little curious with the game barely half over. \nThe other item that will probably get some attention and discussion is the Twins’ pitching during the bottom of the 8th. With the game 7-0, Nick Gordon was summoned to throw batting practice. That went so well (30 pitches, 6 runs, 2 outs) that he was replaced mid-inning with another position player, Jermaine Palacios, to finally get out of the inning. \nThe one silver lining from tonight is that Cleveland also lost, 4-0 to Seattle, which keeps the Twins’ deficit in the division standings at one game. With their win (their fourth straight), the White Sox have crept back to just two games behind Cleveland.\nNo Studs\nAll Duds\nTomorrow:  Bundy vs. Giolito, 1:10p Central",

        "description": "Kirthmon F. Dozier / USA TODAY NETWORK\n    \n\n  The latest addition to Detroit’s major league roster is Lester, a 28-year-old minor league stalwart. Saturday evening, it was reported that the Detroit Tigers intend to call up veteran minor league first baseman Josh Lester. He was lifted from the Toledo Mud Hens’ game against the Rochester Red Wings on Saturday night, and should join the major league club on Sunday. \nMiguel Cabrera’s left biceps strain sent him to the injured list on Saturday night, and opened up an opportunity. Lester will reap the rewards. He has played the entire minor league season with the Toledo Mud Hens, marking his third Triple-A stint during his lengthy career in the Tigers’ farm system.\nIf it feels like Lester has been around forever, that’s pretty much correct. He joined the Tigers organization in 2015, when he was the team’s 13th round pick. Of the team’s 41 selections in that draft class, only he and Tyler Alexander still remain in the Tigers’ organization. Now 28 years old, Lester has played in parts of seven minor league seasons, not counting the 2020 season lost to the pandemic.\nTeams value players who can produce in the minor leagues and provide some veteran leadership as scaffolding for their developmental system, which seems a viable explanation for why he’s been able to hang around for so long. The news of his call up may come as a surprise to some people — it did to me — merely because it seems like he’d have gotten his chance with the team by now if it was coming at all. Players who are viewed as real prospects don’t have to wait until their late 20s to get a cup of coffee, even if their upper majors performances aren’t exactly sparkling. \nDespite those factors working against him, hIs call to the majors is an understandable move on the Tigers’ part. It’s also a reward for his long service on the farm in the form of a couple big checks after years on meager minor league wages.\nThe timing of this opportunity is fantastic for Lester, whose mediocre season-long numbers are dragged down by a poor start and belie a furious hot streak he’s been on for the past two months. Since the beginning of July, he’s cut his strikeout rate nearly in half from last season and is hitting the devil out of the ball. His .279/.325/.535 line is notable in that time span even for the robust offensive environment of the league he plays in and he’s still in the slightly sub-.300 BABIP range, indicating he hasn’t been getting overly lucky. \nAdd to that his 24 home runs — fourth among active players in the Triple-A International League and tied for 37th among all minor leagues everywhere — and it’s clear that Lester has conquered MiLB pitching. The problem, is that he hasn’t conquered it in ways that predict major league success.\nThe absolute best case scenario here is that Lester provides a little pop before pitchers adjust to him. Spencer Torkelson needs all the reps possible, so it would be surprising if we saw Lester at first base much. However, the most fundamental issue with the 2022 Tigers’ offense has been the lack of power, and the inability to hit right-handed pitching with any real success. Lester might provide a little help in that regard. Just don’t make this out to be more than it is. \n\n\nThe Mud Hens get a walk-off win. Josh Lester with the oppo blast. Also, heck of a day for Mud Hens hall-of-fame announcer Jim Weber. Called his 6,000th straight game &amp; gets to call a walk-off homer! pic.twitter.com/e1ZrEALH5X— Jordan Strack (@JordanStrack) April 10, 2022",
