        "link": "https://buckscountybeacon.com/2022/09/bucks-county-board-of-elections-receives-a-multi-million-dollar-cash-infusion/",
        "description": "The Bucks County Board of Elections recently accepted almost $2.5 million in grant money from the Commonwealth to help pay for the upcoming Nov. 8 election based on a simple formula: $5.15 for each of the County’s 476,145 registered voters.\n\n\n\nThe funding is the result of Senate Bill 982, now referred to as Act 88 of 2022, but should not be perceived as a sign of generosity from the Pennsylvania GOP controlled legislature.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe 2020 election brought about dramatic changes in the voting process due to the Covid pandemic. Reporting from PA Spotlight reveals that the Center for Tech and Civic Life (TCL), a not-for-profit organization largely funded by FaceBook’s Mark Zuckerburg, offered grants to help offset increased election costs including the printing of mail in ballots.\n\n\n\nRepublican House leadership expressed animosity toward the TCL funds.\n\n\n\n\n‘Thousands of Little Brush Fires All Over the State’: The PA GOP’s Plan to Subvert Future Elections &#8211; Bucks County Beacon ⁦@BucksCoBeacon⁩  https://t.co/Caslr3400e&mdash; Jennifer Cohn ✍🏻 📢 (@jennycohn1) August 22, 2022\n\n\n\n\n“It is deeply disturbing to me, and to many people I represent, that outside organizations were permitted to ‘invest’ in our elections in this way,” said Rep. Clint Owlett (R-PA68). “As we work to restore the people’s faith in our election processes, eliminating this type of grant funding from outsiders should be a top priority.”\n\n\n\nAccording to Pennsylvania Spotlight’s article, that sentiment was inconsistent with Republican county commissioners.\n\n\n\n“Of the counties that applied — including 13 that former President Donald Trump won in 2020 — all received what they requested or more,” PA Spotlight reported.\n\n\n\n“We had no issues with receiving those dollars or using those dollars,” Juniata County Commissioner Alice Gray, a Republican, told Spotlight PA and Votebeat. Her county — which Trump won with 80 percent of the vote — received $11,364 to spend on poll workers, cleaning supplies, and temporary staff.”\n\n\n\nNevertheless, PA Senate Bill 982 advanced, was passed and now provides additional financial support for conducting elections.\n\n\n\nIn exchange for the money, however, counties must agree to refuse funding from any outside sources and adhere to more stringent reporting.\n\n\n\nThe Bucks County Board of Elections has never received outside funds under the current or prior administrations, according to James O’Malley, the Deputy Director of Communications for the agency.\n\n\n\nExamples of the required reporting — including some documentation that is already performed — incorporates internal auditing to ensure that the names of voters who have died or moved away are removed from the voter rolls.\n\n\n\nA new requirement, with specific regard to mail-in-ballots, includes the non-stop counting of those ballots beginning at 7 a.m. on Election Day and continuing until all ballots received have been tallied.\n\n\n\n“The requirement to continue canvassing without interruption will pose new challenges,” said O’Malley. “We are working out the details of how we intend to continue uninterrupted.”\n\n\n\n\nSurge In #Pennsylvania Women Registering To Vote Since Roe Overturned | #RoevemberIsComing #PA01https://t.co/CJlp6QdgzV&mdash; BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) August 31, 2022\n\n\n\n\nHe doesn’t believe the ballot counting requirements tied to the funding will cause an increase in staffing.\n\n\n\n“There will be no increase in needed poll workers. Bucks uses a mix of full time elections staff, part time elections staff and other County employees to assist in the pre-canvass and canvass” said O’Malley. “Working out the logistics of uninterrupted staffing management will be the bigger administrative task than filling the positions.”\n\n\n\nPotentially, adhering to the audit and reporting requirements may quell some claims of voter fraud that have become all too common.\n\n\n\nO’Malley acknowledged that “eligible grant [funding] uses include physical security and transparency costs, as well as list maintenance activities,” all of which should provide voters with confidence that Bucks County is carrying out free and fair elections.\n\n\n\nThe ACLU initially objected to the legislation due to severe criminal penalties for intentionally disregarding the parameters that govern receipt of the funds. However, the group issues a statement changing “its position from ‘oppose’ to ‘neutral’ on SB 982 when the criminal penalty for violations of its provisions was reduced from a felony to misdemeanor charge and the legislature agreed to $45 million in funding for county election offices in the 2023-2024 budget.”\n\n\n\nOnly four of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties have refused the funds.",

        "description": "Today, on the federal holiday of Labor Day, Judge Aileen M. Cannon of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida granted former president Trump&#8217;s request for a special master to review the nearly 11,000 documents FBI agents seized in their search of the Trump Organization&#8217;s property at Mar-a-Lago on August 8. The special master will examine the documents, some of which have the highest classification markings, to remove personal items or those covered by attorney-client privilege or those that might be covered by executive privilege (although President Joe Biden, who holds the presidency and thus should be able to determine that privilege, has waived it). The order temporarily stops the Department of Justice from reviewing or using the materials as part of their investigation into Trump&#8217;s mishandling of classified information. That is, a Trump-appointed judge, confirmed by the Senate on November 13, 2020, after Trump had lost the election, has stepped between the Department of Justice and the former president in the investigation of classified documents stolen from the government.Legal analysts appear to be appalled by the poor quality of the opinion. Former U.S. acting solicitor general Neal Katyal called it &#8220;so bad it&#8217;s hard to know where to begin.&#8221; Law professor Stephen Vladeck told Charlie Savage of the New York Times that it was &#8220;an unprecedented intervention&#8230;into the middle of an ongoing federal criminal and national security investigation.&#8221; Paul Rosenzweig, a prosecutor in the independent counsel investigation of Bill Clinton, told Savage it was &#8220;a genuinely unprecedented decision&#8221; and said stopping the criminal investigation was &#8220;simply untenable.&#8221; Duke University law professor Samuel Buell added: &#8220;To any lawyer with serious federal criminal court experience&#8230;, this ruling is laughably bad&#8230;. Trump is getting something no one else ever gets in federal court, he&#8217;s getting it for no good reason, and it will not in the slightest reduce the ongoing howls that he&#8217;s being persecuted, when he is being privileged.&#8221; The judge justified her decision because she was &#8220;mindful of the need to ensure at least the appearance of fairness and integrity under the extraordinary circumstances presented.&#8221; Energy and politics reporter David Roberts of Volts pointed out that this is a common pattern for MAGA Republicans. First, they spread lies and conspiracy theories, then they act based on the &#8220;appearance&#8221; that something is shady. &#8220;So this&#8230; judge says Trump deserves extraordinary, unprecedented latitude because of the &#8216;extraordinary circumstances&#8217; and the &#8216;swirling questions about bias.&#8217; But her fellow reactionaries were the only ones raising questions of bias! It&#8217;s a perfectly sealed feedback loop,&#8221; and one the right wing has perfected over &#8220;voter fraud.&#8221; As political scientist Brendan Nyhan points out, bad-faith attacks on our democratic processes open the door for changing those processes.Something else jumps out about the judge&#8217;s construction, though: it makes MAGA Republicans the only ones whose sentiments matter. This is the same construction President Andrew Johnson used to justify his plan to end Reconstruction and remove troops from the South in December 1865. He told Congress that using the army to protect new governments there &#8220;would have divided the people into the vanquishers and the vanquished, and would have envenomed hatred rather than restored affection.&#8221; Missing from Johnson&#8217;s equation were the four million Black southerners who, in fact, welcomed the injection of the weight of the federal government into the former Confederate states. The idea that Cannon felt obliged to reassure MAGA Republicans that Trump is being treated fairly, rather than the rest of us that the rule of law is being protected, redefines the American public and American principles. The neutrality of the law is central to democracy. But it is increasingly under question as Republican-appointed judges make decisions that disregard settled law, and Cannon&#8217;s decision will not help. She actually singles out Trump as having a different relationship to the law than the rest of us in a number of ways, but especially when she expresses concern over how his reputation could be hurt by an indictment: &#8220;As a function of Plaintiff&#8217;s former position as President of the United States, the stigma associated with the subject seizure is in a league of its own. A future indictment, based to any degree on property that ought to be returned, would result in reputational harm of a decidedly different order of magnitude.&#8221; This attack on the rule of law&#8212;the idea that the laws apply to everyone equally&#8212;has been underway since the administration of Ronald Reagan, when Attorney General Edwin Meese set out to, as he said, &#8220;institutionalize the Reagan revolution so it can&#8217;t be set aside no matter what happens in future presidential elections.&#8221; Contrary to established procedures at the Department of Justice, Reagan appointees began to quiz candidates for judgeships about their views on abortion and affirmative action, to tilt the direction in which the courts would rule. The 1982 establishment of the Federalist Society, made up of lawyers determined to roll back the legal decisions of the post&#8211;World War II era, made it easier to tilt the courts. Those lawyers stood against what they called &#8220;judicial activism,&#8221; decisions that justified the expansion of a federal government that regulated business, provided a basic social safety net, protected civil rights, and promoted infrastructure.As Republican policies grew less popular, party leaders focused not on adjusting their policies, but on filling judgeships with judges who would rule in their favor in lawsuits. This focus was so strong by the time of Trump&#8217;s predecessor, President Barack Obama, that then&#8211;Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) stalled confirmations for Obama&#8217;s nominees, banking on leaving vacancies for a new president to fill. Most dramatically, of course, he refused to permit a hearing for Obama&#8217;s nominee for a Supreme Court seat in March 2016, inventing a new rule that that date was too close to the upcoming November election to allow the nomination to proceed. This left the seat free for Trump to appoint Neil Gorsuch, who could not make it through the Senate until McConnell used the so-called &#8220;nuclear option&#8221; to get rid of the filibuster for Supreme Court appointments, which enabled him to squeak through with just 51 votes. Trump and McConnell&#8212;who was known for saying, &#8220;Leave no vacancy behind&#8221;&#8212;made reshaping the federal judiciary their top priority. McConnell approved the new judges with vigor, keeping the Senate confirming them during the pandemic, for example, even when all other business stopped. And he continued to push through appointments&#8212;like that of Judge Cannon&#8212;even after Trump lost the election. Philosopher Jason Stanley of Yale University, best known for his 2018 book How Fascism Works, tweeted today: &#8220;Once you have the courts you can pretty much do whatever you want.&#8221;Cannon&#8217;s decision addresses only the criminal investigation of the former president by the Department of Justice, and it is not clear how much of a delay it will create. While that is on hold, at least temporarily, the intelligence assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence will proceed without check. It is still unclear what documents are missing, and who has had unauthorized access to the information Trump took. This breach of our national security has the potential to be catastrophic. Trump certainly appears to think the game is not yet over. Once again today, he attacked the FBI and the DOJ and demanded the results of the 2020 election be overturned.&#8212;Notes:David Roberts @drvoltsI'm not a legal analyst, but I hope everyone is taking note of a particular maneuver that this Trumpy judge pulled -- a very, very familiar maneuver from reactionaries. \n\nIt goes like this: first the RW propaganda networks spreads of bunch of lies &amp; lunatic conspiracy theories.September 5th 2022474 Retweets1,336 Likes@drvolts on how what happened on voter fraud is now happening with the DOJ - see in particular quote from judge's ruling below.

        "description": "Kiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The lefty got no help from his teammates in another pretty unwatchable performance all around. The Tigers played like a team whose flight didn’t land until an hour before game time and got paddled by Mike Trout, Shohei Ohtani, and the Angels generally on Monday night. In the process they were shutout for the 19th time this season, most for a Tigers team since 1976.\nTyler Alexander got into trouble right out of the gate in this one after the Tigers went 1-2-3 in the top of the first. With one out in the bottom half, Mike Trout singled to right and Shohei Ohtani followed with a double, moving Trout to third. Alexander got a pitch right in on Luis Rengifo’s hands, but he was able to muscle a blooper out into no man’s land in shallow left center field, and it dropped, scoring Trout. A soft ground out by Taylor Ward allowed Ohtani to score from third before Alexander cut things off by getting Matt Duffy to ground out to Báez to end the inning.\nThe second was quiet, with Spencer Torkelson drawing a two-out walk, and Alexander getting a pair of called third strikes for a quick bounceback inning.\nIn the top of the third, the Tigers had their first scoring opportunity. Ryan Kreidler ambushed an absolute meatball from Suarez, but just missed it, flying out to right center field. However, Victor Reyes chopped a one-hopper that ate up the third baseman Rengifo and scampered to second as the ball went down the line for a double. Riley Greene followed with a 110 mph rocket of a one-hopper right at Velazquez at shortstop, but the Angels infielder made a superb pick and threw out Greene with no trouble, Reyes moving to third. That left it up to Willi Castro who promptly popped out to end the inning.\nIn the bottom half, the dynamic duo was at it again. David Fletcher grounded back to Alexander to start the inning, but Trout ripped a double to left. Ohtani followed by crushing another pitch to right for a two-run shot just above the home run mark on the wall. 4-0 Angels. The hits kept coming Rengifo drove one to the warning track in center field. Riley Greene made a nice diving play and had it in his glove, but the ball came lose as he hit the dirt and Rengifo was in with a triple. A sac fly from Ward to center field brought him home, and it was 5-0. \n\n\nTantalizingly close to a \"catch of the year\" play by Riley Greene in deep center field, but the ball escaped his clutches for a triple for Luis Rengifo. pic.twitter.com/1XCkHLLZMw— Adrian Garro (@adriangarro) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nJavier Báez and Eric Haase flailed their way to strikeouts to open the fourth, while Harold Castro grounded out. There was no help coming for Alexander, so we braced for more thunder from the Angels’ bats in the bottom half. And so of course the lefty tossed a quick 1-2-3 frame against the 8-9-1 hitters, getting Fletcher on a line out to Willi Castro in right to end the inning.\nIt was all the kids in the fifth, as Torkelson, Carpenter, and Kreidler were lined up to face Suarez in the inning. Tork got under a fly ball that was routine to right center. Carpenter lined one the opposite way, but Jo Adell was positioned right there to make the catch. Kreidler got down 0-2 and tapped one left of the pitcher’s mound. Suarez lost the handle as he threw and Kreidler reached as the ball went weakly toward Fletcher at second base. Finally Victor Reyes lined another one sharply, but right to Ward in right field.\nTrout stayed back and crushed a changeup for his 30th home run of the year to left field to open the bottom of the fifth. Ohtani made good contact as well, ripping a drive to Torkelson at first for the first out of the inning. Alexander’s pitch count approached 80 as Rengifo then singled to right field. Báez made another error to allow Duffy to reach, and then Matt Duffy doubled over Castro’s head in right after he ran a bad route and had to go back at the last moment. That scored Rengifo and it was 7-0 as Alexander was mercifully lifted by A.J. Hinch, with Luis Castillo taking over to strike out Adell and get Max Stassi to fly out, ending the inning.\nThere weren’t any Tigers highlights, so let’s watch Trout mash for a moment.\n\n\nMike Trout - Los Angeles Angels (30) pic.twitter.com/uNAf6pv1hF— MLB HR Videos (@MLBHRVideos) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nWilli Castro singled with one out in the sixth, but Báez flailed at three straight changeups to strike out. Eric Haase, changing things up, flailed at three straight fastballs instead. \nIn the bottom half, Luis Castillo acquitted himself pretty well. He struck out Velazquez, got Fletcher to ground out, and then struck out Trout on a nasty slider after hitting him on a checked swing with the pitch prior.\nTorkelson ripped an opposite field double in the top of the seventh, in one of the few bright spots on the night. He was stranded there, and Garrett Hill took over in the bottom half only to give up Ohtani’s 32nd homer and second on the night. A Taylor Ward single eventually led to a run after a walk to Duffy, and an RBI single from Stassi. 9-0 Angels.\nOnce again let’s remind ourselves what greatness looks like since we haven’t seen any of it since JV was traded.\n\n\nShohei Ohtani - Los Angeles Angels (32) pic.twitter.com/GDkGRW3Myp— MLB HR Videos (@MLBHRVideos) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nJosh Lester got his first major league at-bat in the eighth, with Riley Greene on first after a walk, and two outs on the board. Lester whiffed on an Andrew Wantz fastball to strike out. \nKody Clemens came on to pitch in the bottom of the eighth, and that led to one moment of hilarity as he struck out Ohtani with a 68 mph eephus that dropped on the outer edge for strike three. He also allowed a run, but we won’t hold that against him. \nThe Tigers got a Harold Castro single in the ninth, and another hard hit ball from Tork, who lined out on a real screamer to center field. Clemens fittingly struck out himself to bring this one to a close. \nOnly 27 games left, folks. I can’t wait to be done with this season and to watch some quality baseball again in October. \n\n\nSave that ball!  Kody Clemens was hyped to strike out Shohei for his first K. pic.twitter.com/UD4zJ29TWk— MLB (@MLB) September 6, 2022",

        "description": "Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n    \n\n  On a fourth consecutive sweltering night at Dodger Stadium, it was perfect “tees off” weather in Los Angeles. The Giants did just that on Monday, slamming four home runs off Andrew Heaney in a 7-4 win in the series opener that raised more questions than answers.\nSeptember is about sorting out the roster for October for the Dodgers, especially on the pitching side, with several hurlers in various states of rehabilitation trying to make one final push for the postseason.\nOn one hand, Heaney stands out, with the highest strikeout rate on the entire staff (35.1 percent), and is apparently healthy after two long stints on the injured list with shoulder troubles, having made his last eight starts. He has 36 strikeouts against only three walks over his last four starts, so things should be looking up.\nThe Giants provided a bright highlighter for Heaney’s main issues of late, with Lewis Brinson and J.D. Davis taking him deep in a three-run third inning. Thairo Estrada and David Villar took him deep in a three-run fourth.\nHeaney’s 11 home runs are tied for second-most allowed on the staff, though he’s only pitched 52 innings. Ten of those home runs are in his last four starts, during which Heaney has a 5.57 ERA, turning the Dodgers’ question from which role to use him in the postseason to whether they’d be comfortable pitching him at all in October.\nThose decisions don’t have to be made now, obviously. There’s room in the schedule for Heaney to start four or five more times during the regular season in order to figure things out. By the end of that journey, the other pitching candidates should be more clear.\nDespite the long balls, the Dodgers were in this game, though a few self-inflicted wounds handicapped the best offense in the sport.\nFreddie Freeman got things started with a two-run home run to right in the first, cashing in a throwing error by Evan Longoria. That gave the Dodgers 97 first-inning runs on the season, tops in the majors and their most prolific inning. That was the 17th home run of the year for Freeman, whose homers have come in a few short bursts and several long droughts.\nThis home run was Freeman’s first since August 15, snapping a string of 19 full games and 87 plate appearances without. Freeman, who leads the majors in hits and doubles, was still reasonably productive despite not hitting any balls over the wall, hitting .317/.356/.390 with six doubles in between homers. That August 15 home run also snapped an 87-PA drought, during which he also hit six doubles.\nLos Angeles got another run against Logan Webb in the fourth, but cost themselves further opportunities. Trea Turner had second base stolen with two outs in the third, only to briefly step off the bag while popping up from his slide. Inning over.\nJoey Gallo’s double scored a run in the fourth and put runners on second and third with one out, only to see Miguel Vargas fly out meekly and Cody Bellinger strike out looking to end the frame.\nAustin Barnes singled to open the fifth, then Mookie Betts doubled to left. With nobody out and Turner and Freeman due up, third base coach Dino Ebel sent Barnes home for some reason, where he was thrown out by a mile. The Dodgers did not score in that inning.\nBarnes did get to score at his own pace in the seventh, hitting his third home run in his last seven starts, pulling the Dodgers to within two runs. Since the beginning of August, in 10 games, Barnes is hitting .382/.447/.706 with five extra-base hits. \nOf note\n\nCaleb Ferguson, who opened Sunday’s game with three strikeouts in a perfect inning, got the final two outs of the sixth on Monday following Heaney, the first back-to-back outings for Ferguson in the majors this season. He also did so on May 27-28 with Triple-A Oklahoma City.\nJustin Bruihl, called up earlier Monday, pitched the final two innings. The eighth was scoreless, but he allowed another home run to Brinson in the ninth, the fifth homer for the Giants on Monday.\nFive home runs are the most allowed by the Dodgers in a game this season. Five home runs also match a Giants high at Dodger Stadium, done also in 1999 and 2004.\n\nMonday particulars\nHome runs: Freddie Freeman (17), Austin Barnes (7); Lewis Brinson 2 (2), J.D. Davis (9), Thairo Estrada (12), David Villar (2)\nWP — Logan Webb (12-8): 6 IP, 7 hits, 3 runs (2 earned), 6 strikeouts\nLP — Andrew Heaney (2-2): 5⅓ IP, 6 hits, 6 runs, 1 walk, 8 strikeouts\nSv — Camilo Doval (20): 1 IP, 1 hit, 2 strikeouts\nUp next\nTyler Anderson has a 2.20 ERA in 11 games at Dodger Stadium this season, and he starts the middle game of the series on Tuesday (7:10 p.m.; SportsNet LA, MLB Network). San Francisco hasn’t named a starter yet, but expect several pitchers to take the mound.",

        "description": "Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The late-night/early-morning hangout for Cubs fans asks if DH Franmil Reyes is a building block for a winner.  Welcome back to BCB After Dark: the groovin’ happening for night owls, early-risers, new parents and Cubs fans abroad. It’s good to see you at the end of this holiday weekend. I hope you were able to enjoy yourself and spend some time with friends and family. Invite them here. There are still several good tables available for tonight’s show. Please let us know if we can do anything for you. Settle in and relax. Bring your own beverage.\nBCB After Dark is the place for you to talk baseball, music, movies, or anything else you need to get off your chest, as long as it is within the rules of the site. The late-nighters are encouraged to get the party started, but everyone else is invited to join in as you wake up the next morning and into the afternoon.\nThe Cubs were off today. They are home tomorrow night against the Reds.\nLast week, I asked you if the Cubs would break their own record by having 70 players get into a game this season. They’ve already used 60 and Hayden Wesneski will make it 61 when he gets into a game. But by a margin of 73 percent to 27 percent, you think the Cubs will fall short of that number.\nHere’s the part where I talk about movies and jazz. You’re free to skip ahead to the baseball question at the end. You won’t hurt my feelings.\n\nHere’s a treat that I found on the web this weekend. It’s a performance from the legendary drummer Roy Haynes in 2019, at a mere 94 years old. He’s 97 now and it’s amazing to think this man has had a musical career that has lasted 80 years. I don’t know how many people are still alive who played with Charlie Parker and Lester Young, but Haynes is one. \nSo here’s Haynes at the Blue Note in New York City with Martin Bejerano on keyboards, David Wong on bass and Jaleel Shaw on sax.\nThere is about a two minute and fifteen second introduction before they actually get to the music, if you’re wondering when Haynes will actually start playing in this video.\n\n\nI know today is a holiday and an off-day for the Cubs and that means a low-traffic day on this site. So I’m not going to write about any movie that people are going to feel sorry about missing. That means tonight’s topic of conversation is the 1989 classic comedy Weekend at Bernie’s, directed by Ted Kotcheff and starring Andrew McCarthy, Jonathan Silverman and Terry Kiser. \nI’m picking Weekend at Bernie’s today because it’s a Labor Day movie. The entire plot takes place in a one-week span leading into the Labor Day weekend. Most of the film takes place out in the Hamptons in eastern Long Island over the Labor Day weekend. I was going to say that Weekend at Bernie’s is the greatest Labor Day movie ever made by default, because I couldn’t think of any other ones. But a little research tells me that Stand By Me takes place over Labor Day weekend and Dirty Dancing ends during the Labor Day weekend. So throw that out. Let’s just say that Weekend at Bernie’s is one of the greatest Labor Day movies by default.\n(If you search for Labor Day movies, you’ll get stuff like Norma Rae or Matewan or other films about the labor movement. Those are all well and good and you should see them. But what I’m really talking about is movies that take place during Labor Day weekend and how there should be more of them. Groundhog Day isn’t a movie about rodents and the weather, after all. It’s just a hook for a larger story.) \nI’m going to assume that everyone knows the basic hook of Weekend at Bernie’s, since it’s an internet meme and in fact, it’s part of the promotions for the film. Two wannabe eighties yuppies, Larry (McCarthy) and Richard (Silverman), have to pretend that their dead boss Bernie (Kiser) is still alive. That means this is a film that you have to check your brain at the door. Larry and Richard have to drag Bernie’s corpse around all weekend and convince everyone that he’s still living. Luckily, no one else in the film is any smarter than Larry and Richard and easily fall for the gag. This is a dumb film about dumber people.\nWeekend at Bernie’s has become a bit of a punchline, both because of its idiotic premise and the horrible sequel that was worked into the plot of an episode of Seinfeld. But while I’m not going to pretend that Weekend at Bernie’s is any great piece of art, I will tell you that if you haven’t seen it, it’s better than you probably think it is. This is in large part to the physical comedy by Kiser (and presumably some stuntmen) as the corpse. \nThe gist of the plot is that Larry and Richard, working on the weekend before Labor Day, discover some fraud going on at the insurance company that they work for. Well, mostly Richard discovers it because Larry is too busy goofing off. But they are both office drones who hope to climb the corporate ladder and the two of them think that discovering this fraud will get them promotions. \nRichard also has a crush on Gwen (Catherine Mary Stewart), who also works at the company, but he’s too shy and awkward to ask her out. This is a romantic subplot that goes on through the movie that doesn’t serve a lot of purpose other than to differentiate Richard from Larry. Which is good because these two doofuses are a lot alike otherwise. \nLarry and Richard go to their boss, Bernie Lomax, with evidence of the fraud. Unbeknownst to them, it’s actually Bernie who is stealing the money and he’s working for the mob. Bernie pretends to praise them for their discovery and he invites the two out to his house on the beach in the Hamptons for Labor Day weekend as a reward and to discuss this further. \nBernie’s actual agenda is to have Larry and Richard killed by a hitman working for his boss in the mob. (Why? I have no idea. Wouldn’t it just be easier to fire Larry and Richard if you’re trying to cover up evidence of your crimes?) But the mob boss decides that it’s just easier to kill Bernie instead.\nLarry and Richard show up at Bernie’s place and he’s already dead. They wonder what to do until beautiful women start showing up at Bernie’s place because he has a party there every Saturday. The characters who show up for the party are all stock caricatures of rich party-goers of the 1980’s. They are also all so self-absorbed (and stupid) that they talk to the dead Bernie and never even notice that he’s dead. \nLarry wants to stay around for the party and then call the police about Bernie’s death afterwards. He thinks they at least deserve a party for their misery. Richard is reluctant until Gwen shows up and he sees this as his big chance with her. \nSo Saturday is all spent with Larry and Richard tying to pretend Bernie is alive for the party to keep going. But by Sunday, they discover that Bernie was actually murdered and that they were supposed to be murdered too. They think they only way to stay alive is to make the killers think Bernie is alive, when in reality they are only in danger because the two of them have convinced the hit man that Bernie is still breathing and he needs to finish the job.\nYes, it’s every bit as stupid as it sounds. And the characters of Larry and Richard are not really appealing enough in any way for us to want to root for them. They are struggling young pretty-boy white professionals whose ambition is to be a pair of vapid, rich playboys like Bernie. \nBut the film is really saved by the performance of the very-much-still-alive Terry Kiser as Bernie. The physical comedy of McCarthy and Silverman dragging Kiser around the beach is quite good and I admit I laughed at dumb gags like the pulley system that Larry sets up so it can look like Bernie is waving to people. Or when they staple Bernie’s toupee back onto his dead skull. \nLook, you either lean into how stupid this film is or you don’t. As they said in This is Spinal Tap, there’s a fine line between clever and stupid. \nHere’s a scene where Larry and Richard drag Bernie’s corpse around the party.\n\n\nWelcome back to everyone who skips the music and movies.\nFranmil Reyes now has 25 games under his belt as a Cub and he’s hitting .281/.320/.510 with four home runs and 13 RBI. That’s not too far from his career-norms—the batting average is too high but the OBP is close and the slugging percentage isn’t too much higher—but it’s a huge improvement over what he did in Cleveland this season before the Guardians designated him for assignment.\nI think it’s fair to say that Reyes has earned a spot on the Cubs roster for 2022. I can’t say that for sure he’ll be back next year—after all, we don’t know whom the Cubs will sign this winter and we know there’s going to be a 40-man roster crunch—but with him only being arbitration-eligible for the second year and not being eligible for free agency until the 2025 season, it doesn’t seem like much of a risk to keep him around.\nBut tonight’s one of our questions on whether Reyes is just someone to tide the Cubs over until good times return or if he’s a building block for the future. Reyes is only just turned 27 years old (This is Reyes’ 26-year-old season) and he hit 30 home runs for Cleveland last year and 37 between San Diego and Cleveland in 2019. On the other hand, at least with the Cubs he’s been a DH-only and there was a reason the Guardians put him on waivers in August. \nI guess your answer to this question depends in large part on how far away you think “the next great Cubs team” is. You can put your two cents in on that in the comments. \nSo is Reyes a building block for the “next great Cubs team” or is he just a stopgap until the Cubs get there?\n\nThank you so much for finishing up the long weekend with us. Be sure to check and make sure you’ve got anything. Stay cool out there. Be sure to tip your waitstaff. If you need a ride home, let us know if we can call someone for you. Get home safely. Enjoy the rest of the week. And join us again tomorrow night for another edition of BCB After Dark.",

        "description": "You may disagree with the US author’s bracing journalism, but her right to spark disquiet goes to the heart of the freedom of expression issueOf all the many hundreds of people I’ve interviewed down the years, only a handful have ever liked to refer to themselves in the third person, a habit I usually take as a sign of borderline insanity. About Lionel Shriver, however, I see no current cause for alarm. OK, so she does call herself Shriver in the introduction to her latest book (“Shriver supported Brexit,” she writes, at the beginning of a sizeable list of the crimes she has committed in the eyes of the progressive and the pious). But her sanity, it seems to me, is not (or not yet) in doubt. Offer her a glass of fizzing, liberal-left Kool-Aid and her response will be to run, at speed, to the nearest tap in search of a generous gallon of cold water.In Abominations, a collection mostly of her journalism, Shriver splashes this icy water all over and it’s very bracing; as I read, I thought of those scientists who tell us that a daily cold shower can help to boost the human immune system. It feels ever more vital to me – a matter of simple good health – that people try sometimes to read writers with whom they disagree (though I don’t always disagree with her); to do so is akin to filling the lungs with oxygen. It’s not only that we can’t know what we really think unless we’ve something to push against; it should be possible, just occasionally, for us to change our minds. Almost nothing worries me more about our present culture than the fact that the words “I was wrong” are now almost entirely absent from public discourse. Continue reading...",

        "description": "The annual ritual of buying school uniform has been more hellish than ever this year. Isn’t there a better alternative?School uniform becomes a hot-button issue at this time of year, for obvious reasons: half the country is bankrupted by it, and the other half wonders why they have to dress their kids up like pretend executives on polyester wages, and there’s a fierce debate on Mumsnet about whether it’s bad for equality (so expensive), or good (at least you don’t have to buy other clothes). Then they’ll get distracted and never resolve the issue. I don’t think it can be resolved – it’s an empty signifier. Whether uniformed or not, inequality between children will persist for as long as inequality between adults does, and sure, send them to school naked in an awareness-raising exercise, but; don’t kid yourself that this is the solution or even the beginning of one.Even if you can’t get aerated about uniform, you still have to buy it. The system for purchasing it is abstruse, and it is stacked against you, and there is no gaming it, and sometimes I think the people who don’t know there is one are happier in the long run. In my local uniform shop, there are three queues: an orderly, short one, for the people who have an appointment; a longer one full of anguish, for the people who arrived late for their appointment; and a wild, tumultuous one, like the last airlift out of a war zone, for the people who didn’t realise you needed one. There is zero solidarity between the queues, which is a shame, because once you get inside, you’re really going to need it.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...",

Ten of Africa’s political leaders are over 75; the average age of an African president is 62.According to the Global Center on Adaptation, young people in Africa are often excluded from politics precisely because Africa has its oldest generation squarely at the helm of political leadership.

Still, like Thomas with his unshakeable faith in rail engine-kind and the wisdom of the Fat Controller, this soppy Netflix feature may tickle the tear ducts of even some cynical viewers, particularly if they have a soft spot for stories about special needs kids exceeding expectations.After a pre-credit sequence set in the early 00s when a certain kind of bland boyband was all the rage – although some might say that the moment never really passed – a quintet of English lads in a group called Stereo Dream play their last gig together. Flash-forward 20 years, and Stereo Dream’s erstwhile “mysterious” leader Vince (Ed Skrein, arguably best known for playing the first blond incarnation of Daenerys’ boo Daario in Game of Thrones) lives in relative obscurity in Peckham. Meanwhile, his former bandmate Austin (Eoin Macken) has become a star big enough for his retirement from touring to be a big deal, although anyone with a passing familiarity with the music industry would spot this doesn’t make a lot economic sense given the nature of the biz.

        "description": "As women, we owe it to one another to make space for difficult conversations. Friendships depend on it“It’s as if you are pressing your nose against the sweet-shop window of life, and you’re never ever going to be on the other side.” Jody Day is describing involuntary childlessness. The author and founder of Gateway Women, a global friendship, support and advocacy network for childless women, tells me about what she describes as the “friendship apocalypse” that can happen between women when one is able to have the children she dreamed of and the other doesn’t. After realising that children weren’t going to happen for her as a result of “social infertility” (which means not having children due to circumstance rather than medical issues and is the most common reason for childlessness), Day experienced profound grief. In the process, she lost friends.“I began to find it incredibly painful to be around my friends with children. And I also realised that I had been the one doing the work to maintain friendships. And when I stopped doing that, when I stopped keeping up with their children’s birthdays, with likes on Facebook, with just making sure I was included – what happened? Crickets. It was like I had dropped off the planet. I heard from practically nobody. It was an incredibly lonely period of my life.”Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author Continue reading...",

        "description": "We already fight over the smallest things. How can we tackle this problem without breaking up?I am a married man with three kids and have been with my wife for nearly 18 years. At the beginning of our relationship we had a healthy and fulfilling sex life – I wouldn’t claim it to be Kama Sutra levels but we had fun. However, since having children, our intimacy has all but stopped. We last had sex five years ago and these days all we do is have the occasional peck on the lips. I don’t know where to start with trying to fix the relationship or whether I should even try. Is it possible to live together without that element of the relationship? Lately it’s clear that we are frustrated and picking at each other over really small things. I fear opening up the conversation will lead to a bigger challenge. The last thing I want is for us to break up.You are insightful and know what you do and do not want, but things will not improve without a touch of bravery. Perhaps you are afraid that one or both of you might become angry and offer an ultimatum. Try to broach the conversation gently, avoiding any tendency to be judgmental or apportion blame. People rarely take umbrage when a partner expresses their true feelings (different from thoughts or judgment) and clearly asks for specific change. Take it step by step. For example, you might first say: “I love you very much and truly value our marriage, but I have been feeling sad and am filled with longing about a precious aspect of our relationship that somehow got lost. Would you please agree to at least discuss this? Please help me understand.” Then listen carefully to what she has to say. This problem will not be fixed quickly, but if you can both share your feelings it will help you towards a better understanding and resolution.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).

Conductor Roger Norrington explains how the composer’s own father helped rewire brains and eradicate wobbleWho was it who said that two of the most fascinating things in life are sex and the 18th century? Certainly for lovers of classical music it is a century of quite extraordinary riches: beginning with the late baroque joys of Bach and Handel, overseeing the rise of opera, the sonata, string quartet and symphony, witnessing the entire classical movement, and ending with a bang with Beethoven.Born smack in the middle of that century, in 1756, was one of the most intriguing and mysterious of all those marvellous composers, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. A child genius of extraordinary powers, he lived to write more than 600 works in all the possible genres before his tragically early death at 35. If Joseph Haydn led the march into the classical period, it was Mozart who for us perhaps most typifies it. His music’s extraordinary blend of courtly grandeur, impish humour and sheer beauty takes our breath away. The unending flow of melody, the total command of atmosphere, character, structure, counterpoint and orchestral colour take command equally of our emotions and our minds. We are in the world of the sublime. Continue reading...",

        "description": "A grieving woman’s childhood nanny reappears in a compelling debut, a ticking noise spells trouble in Simon Mayo’s latest, and Vera Stanhope is back in a friends reunited taleSue Keller, whose mother died when she was a child, is drifting through life in New York after the recent death of her father. She’s avoiding human contact as much as possible, until she bumps into Anneliese, who tells her she used to be Sue’s live-in nanny. At first, Sue doesn’t recognise her, but then the memories come flooding back and she finds herself desperate to cling on to this woman who represents a part of her vanished childhood. But there may be more to Anneliese than Sue remembers: why did her father never mention this beloved nanny? What happened to her after she left the Kellers’ home? And where is the line between love and obsession? Nanny Dearest (Quercus, £9.99) is American writer Flora Collins’s first novel, and it’s one to race through, the sense of looming dread growing exponentially as the truth about both Sue and Anneliese starts to seep out. If, like me, you were joyfully terrified by The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (starring Rebecca De Mornay) in the 1990s, then this is the thriller for you.Italian author Elena Varvello’s Can You Hear Me? was the story of a small community in northern Italy riven by some very dark crimes. Varvello’s Just a Boy (Two Roads, £16.99), translated by Alex Valente, tells of another tiny Italian community, Cave, where terrible things have also happened. The boy at its heart is 17, and much loved by his parents and his two sisters. They can’t quite believe it when rumours start to spread that he has been breaking into his neighbours’ homes and stealing things. But then he commits an attack that will change everything, for himself and his family, for the rest of their lives. His crime spreads its tentacles throughout the novel, but Varvello is more interested in exploring its fallout – how his mother has never been able to move on, driven to despair by her son’s actions; how his father has struggled to survive; what it’s done to his older sisters. Pietro, the father, finds a notebook filled with his daughter’s handwriting, her brother’s name scrawled repeatedly on the page. “The weight of that name – the enormous rock around his neck – pulled him to the floor, his back against the bed and his hands pressed to his mouth.” Varvello’s boy of the title is never named, but his presence is all-encompassing – although it is only towards the end that we start to see the world through his anguished eyes in this darkly eloquent and moving novel.

Still, like Thomas with his unshakeable faith in rail engine-kind and the wisdom of the Fat Controller, this soppy Netflix feature may tickle the tear ducts of even some cynical viewers, particularly if they have a soft spot for stories about special needs kids exceeding expectations.After a pre-credit sequence set in the early 00s when a certain kind of bland boyband was all the rage – although some might say that the moment never really passed – a quintet of English lads in a group called Stereo Dream play their last gig together. Flash-forward 20 years, and Stereo Dream’s erstwhile “mysterious” leader Vince (Ed Skrein, arguably best known for playing the first blond incarnation of Daenerys’ boo Daario in Game of Thrones) lives in relative obscurity in Peckham. Meanwhile, his former bandmate Austin (Eoin Macken) has become a star big enough for his retirement from touring to be a big deal, although anyone with a passing familiarity with the music industry would spot this doesn’t make a lot economic sense given the nature of the biz.

        "description": "Venice film festival: A wealthy young woman, friendless and lost after studying abroad, sets about recovering an old friendship she thinks she once hadActor-turned-director Carolina Cavalli makes her feature debut with this elegant, angular contrivance: an absurdist existential comedy about an entitled twentysomething called Amanda (Benedetta Porcaroli, from Netflix’s Baby) who has reached a quarterlife crisis.Amanda has finished an unsatisfying period in Paris studying and returned to her wealthy family home in Italy, the scene of a near-drowning childhood accident in the swimming pool and the base for her extended dysfunctional clan. Like someone awakening from a dream, Amanda realises she has no boyfriend, no job and no friends. So when her mother (Monica Nappo) tells her that she once played as a little kid with a local girl called Rebecca, the daughter of her mother’s friend (Giovanna Mezzogiorno), Amanda sets out with fanatical determination to re-befriend this now adult woman (Galatéa Belluggi), or to create the illusion that they were once friends. Rebecca turns out to be an agoraphobic shut-in, quite as messed up as Amanda, but this only increases her eligibility for being Amanda’s new best mate.The film, like its heroine, is on its own spectrum of emotional bewilderment, full of looming closeups and wayward, asymmetric compositions, with something of Lanthimos or Kaurismaki, or the Italian director Paolo Sorrentino whose influence is obvious and who is in fact credited for his special contribution. It is a film that riffs entertainingly on details that are part of what is essentially a comically first-world-problem universe: Amanda is obsessed with getting enough supermarket loyalty points to get an electric fan which she can sell online. She even gets a temp job at an electrical goods store and instantly behaves with insouciant high-handedness towards her baffled boss. But does she really need the money? She meets a guy at a techno club (with weirdly few customers) and decides that he is to be her boyfriend, and moreover conceives an obsession with owning a horse that she has seen in a nearby field.

Conductor Roger Norrington explains how the composer’s own father helped rewire brains and eradicate wobbleWho was it who said that two of the most fascinating things in life are sex and the 18th century? Certainly for lovers of classical music it is a century of quite extraordinary riches: beginning with the late baroque joys of Bach and Handel, overseeing the rise of opera, the sonata, string quartet and symphony, witnessing the entire classical movement, and ending with a bang with Beethoven.Born smack in the middle of that century, in 1756, was one of the most intriguing and mysterious of all those marvellous composers, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. A child genius of extraordinary powers, he lived to write more than 600 works in all the possible genres before his tragically early death at 35. If Joseph Haydn led the march into the classical period, it was Mozart who for us perhaps most typifies it. His music’s extraordinary blend of courtly grandeur, impish humour and sheer beauty takes our breath away. The unending flow of melody, the total command of atmosphere, character, structure, counterpoint and orchestral colour take command equally of our emotions and our minds. We are in the world of the sublime. Continue reading...",

They published a paper on it in 2018. To their great surprise, in fewer than five years, it has become one of the most ubiquitous tools in modern biology research. UMAP has now been used to study everything from forecasting rain in the Alps to identifying the many-hued pigments in a Gauguin artwork to modeling how Covid-19 tweets are disseminated. And, of course, scientists have applied UMAP to studying the actual virus itself. The technique is now the method of choice for most computational biologists who want to see what, exactly, is going on in a dataset.Continue to STAT+ to read the full story&hellip;",

As part of the Beautiful South, Heaton and Abbott churned out hits including Rotterdam (Or Anywhere), Don’t Marry Her, and Perfect 10, the band’s defining, platinum-selling hit.Heaton and Abbott parted ways in 2000 after Abbott decided to take time off to prioritise her family. But she and Heaton couldn’t be kept apart for too long: in 2013, nearly 20 years after they first met, the pair reunited for What Have We Become?, their first album under their own names. Since then, they’ve gone on to release three more records, the most recent of which was 2020’s Manchester Calling, their first No 1 as a duo. On 7 October, they’ll release NK-Pop, a new album recorded at Manchester’s Blueprint Studios with the pair’s longtime collaborator John Williams, which promises to be another collection of catchy, drily comic pop-rock.

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Giancarlo Stanton exits after injuring himself on swing; Anthony Rizzo dealing with headaches after epidural; Gleyber Torres discusses second-half struggles; Luis Severino to continue rehab assignment with Somerset Newsday | Anthony Rieber: More bad injury news; Giancarlo Stanton was removed from yesterday’s game with the Twins after fouling a pitch off his foot in the sixth. Stanton finished that at-bat, but was pinch-hit for come the eighth inning. The slugger has looked lost since returning from the injured list, and now we’ll see if this latest malady will only shelve him momentarily, or if another IL trip is in order. The team announced after the game that X-rays on Stanton’s foot were negative.\nCBS Sports: We received some word on the Anthony Rizzo front, as the first baseman continues to deal with lingering back issues. Aaron Boone said that Rizzo’s back is coming along, but that he’s dealing with headaches as a result of the epidural he received. A return today was initially possible, but it now sounds like it will be at least until tomorrow that Rizzo is able to re-join the team.\nNJ.com | Brendan Kuty: Gleyber Torres spoke candidly about his second-half struggles during the series in Tampa. “I think the league (made) an adjustment and pitch me different”, Torres said, citing his difficulty with offspeed pitches of late. It’s good to hear Torres being reflective and honest about his tough time at the plate, but of course, it will all be soft comfort if he doesn’t find a way to actually get a hit every once in a while. \nCBS Sports: Luis Severino is slated to continue his rehab assignment tomorrow with Double-A Somerset. The right-hander threw 22 pitches for Low-A Tampa last week in an appearance shortened by rain, and will likely need a few more starts to get fully stretched out. The Yankees anticipate he may be able to come off the IL after this next outing.",

        "description": "Moth Club, LondonMatching the garage-y sound of their new record to a 300-capacity venue, this show is a euphoric return to  basicsThis was supposed to be a secret. The name on the bill is Crushed Kid, described as a “brand sparkling new post-punk band”, but there’s a remarkable number of Suede T-shirts in the room and no audible gasps of surprise when the Britpop pioneers (who reunited to great effect in 2013) take to the stage. The grapevine must be very efficient.Moth Club, a 300-capacity ex-servicemen’s club backroom with a backdrop of chintzy tassels in which Simon Gilbert’s drumstick gets briefly ensnared, is unusually small for Suede, but they do like to start again. They stretch out (or break up), then snap back to basics. It happened with 1996’s Coming Up and 2013’s Bloodsports, and now again with new album Autofiction, hard on the heels of their debut single’s 30th anniversary. While their last album, The Blue Hour, featured strings, field recordings and spoken word, Autofiction sounds like five men in a room making a handsome racket, as if casting a spell to ward off middle-aged complacency. Hence the frantic intimacy of the Moth Club. For the first time in many years, Suede are extremely loud and incredibly close. Continue reading...",

        "description": "The world famous photographer, known for portraits of Britney Spears, Eminem, Tupac and Angelina Jolie, discusses his long career ahead of a new retrospectivePhotographer David LaChapelle – best known for his hyperreal, surrealistic portraits of pop stars – has come full circle. Running away from the bullying he received as a queer teenager in his native Connecticut, LaChapelle found an artistic path forward in 80s New York City, becoming an acolyte of Andy Warhol. Following in the footsteps of his mentor, he went on to build an artistic career obsessed with the mysterious juncture of consumerism and celebrity. In so doing, he’s worked with seemingly everyone, from Tupac Shakur and Madonna to Kim and Kanye, Lizzo, and Travis Scott.Just as LaChapelle made it to the pulsing heart of our frenzied celebrity culture, racking up a Rolling Stone cover, being feted by Jay-Z on the track All the Way Up, and even shooting Kim Kardashian’s Christmas card, he experienced a kind of spiritual rebirth: he retreated from the limelight to settle in Hawaii, where he started over and created a life far away from the media industrial complex that had defined his career. But now he is making a grand return to the city that started it all, with a monumental solo show at Fotografiska New York’s six-storey home, the first time this venue has been taken over by a single artist.

        "description": "As two amateurish crims waiting out for a deal with more serious operators, Flynn and Poulter play soul-baring geezers who break into startling arias of longingIf nothing else, this shaggy-dog crime comedy-musical wins points for originality. It’s almost certainly the first British crime film to swap oi-shut-it geezerish banter for songs. Though to be fair, the characters here don’t break into showtunes but baleful ballads of existential rawness written by actor-musician Johnny Flynn. He also co-stars as Mike, one of two amateurish criminals on their way (20 grand in the car boot) to pull off a deal with bigtime crooks – the “score” of the title. Flynn’s Mike is the boss; Will Poulter plays his mildly gormless lunk of a sidekick, Troy.At a roadside caff in the middle of nowhere, the pair bicker as they wait for their gangland connection to show up. And they wait. Troy falls head over heels with spiky drop dead gorgeous waiter Gloria (Naomi Ackie). This causes him to doubt his image of manhood: the violence, swagger and machismo he’s been around his whole life. As a character he doesn’t make a whole lot of a sense: a bit of a thicko who nevertheless ponders the many meanings of the word “score” and can hold his own in Shakespearean English. Still, Poulter is a brilliant comic actor and supremely likable. On the basis of his work here, producers of Fargo should snap him up instantly for the next season. Continue reading...",

This year’s midterms will be the first major referendum on the Biden era of government — and a test of how much voters want to reinstall the Trump wing of the Republican Party.On today’s episode, Astead W. Herndon, a political reporter and the host of our new podcast, “The Run-Up,” offers a guide to the campaign. He’ll explore the forces at play in this election and how we arrived at such a fraught moment in American politics.Background reading: Listen to the premiere of \"The Run-Up,\" a podcast dedicated to the 2022 midterms.Democratic leaders, once beaten down by the prospect of a brutal midterm election in the fall, sense a shift in the political winds. But it may not be enough.Heading into 2022, Republicans were confident of a red wave. But now some are signaling concern that the referendum they anticipated on President Biden is being complicated by former President Donald Trump.For more information on today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily.

        "description": "On the East Coast, people thrive on the idea that the only thing Southern California has to offer its residents is sunshine. L.A.: cultural wasteland with good weather. It’s old. However, reflecting that opinion, people here in L.A. tend to strut and brag about the weather, as if they believe weather is all that matters in a human life. Eventually that may be true. For the most vulnerable people in L.A. during this summer’s severe, unevenly felt heat wave, it already is.Truly, when I first arrived in L.A. 20 years ago (I cringe when I mention that enormous number), I noticed that the one thing both long-term transplants and actual Californians would cite as a reason to live in L.A. really was the weather. Sometimes I moaned about how I missed New York and my friends and family “back East”—and also what was so great about palm trees, not to mention cacti and crummy chaparral, and did anyone like driving all the time? The Californians would fix me with a stare as if I were insane and ask me to check the weather in L.A. that day and compare it with New York’s. In New York, every time, there was sleet or an electrical storm, an Arctic squall or a hurricane. Here in L.A., it was, as ever, another sunny day.That meteorological superiority was supposed to excuse all other deficiencies. But things have changed in California. First, we’re in the middle of the longest drought in recent memory. In L.A., rules about water usage are changing from month to month but always tightening. Second, and at the same time, the annual fire season is getting longer and longer, starting now in late spring and sometimes extending through November. And third, the temperature, which seems to be sinking in the winter, is rising in the summer. (Several days last winter, L.A. was colder than New York.)[Caroline Mimbs Nyce: America is going to have a ‘Heat Belt’]Our current heat wave began Wednesday. “Excessive Heat Warning,” read my weather app, day after day. The Los Angeles Times featured a big photo on the front page above the fold of an orange sky blasted by a ball of white light that was the sun. “UNDER A HEAT DOME” was the headline, in all caps, for the paper’s opening feature on the extraordinary temperatures. “California will broil this week in a ‘long-duration event,’” ran the subhead. One day last week, the temperature was 112 degrees—in Castaic, along the 5 freeway—“beneath a cloudless sky,” as the paper put it, so hot that several firefighters were pulled from the battle against the Route Fire because of heat-induced illness. Later in the week, temperatures reached 102 in Encino in the San Fernando Valley and were trending upward. At one point, a legendary but possibly not perfectly accurate thermometer in Death Valley showed a reading of 127, which would have made it the hottest place on Earth at that moment.This heat wave is more dangerous than previous ones because night does not bring the expected “temperature recovery,” as weather experts call it, especially inland where wildfires tend to arise with greater frequency than right along the coast. In the thick of our hot, dry summer, The New York Times suddenly announced that because of climate change, disastrous and unprecedented rain and snowfall would surely cause a 1,000-year flood event in California. A month-long superstorm. Right now, it doesn’t seem imminent.Throughout the world, meteorological events tend to highlight social inequalities. Here too. During the extended drought, for example, the residences of certain celebrities have exceeded municipal water allowances to a shocking degree. Among these, the former NBA shooting guard Dwayne Wade’s $18 million estate in the Hidden Hills neighborhood above Malibu recently went beyond the district’s monthly allotted water budget by more than 1,400 percent, or 90,000 gallons. Those of us without $18 million mansions are shutting off our sprinklers and leaving our gardens to wilt and die. Front lawns are turning brown from heat and drought. If you’re not rich enough to entirely rethink your landscaping and festoon it with decomposed granite and winding paths and cacti and succulents that require very little water, what you’re left with is a dirt garden with sticklike remnants of plants. Meanwhile, as the Los Angeles Times has also reported, the number of Californians who must deal with contaminated drinking water because of the drought has reached almost a million.Heat isn’t felt equally, either. I write this with my fan blowing and my air-conditioning ready to blast. Most of the city’s residents are staying inside, too, unless life forces them out. In the homeless encampments around the city, and on Skid Row, though, everyone is outdoors in whatever shade they can find, because the tents are dangerously hot. I drove by an encampment under a freeway where I saw people sitting on the curb—as if the curb were a stoop or a front yard—or leaning against the walls that supported the overpass, chatting and fanning themselves.[Read: Earth’s new gilded era]Dog walking begins at 6 a.m., because at six it’s only 74 degrees. By midmorning it’s 90 degrees, and those unlucky enough to have to run an essential errand scurry down the hot sidewalks and jump back into their car. A few days ago, I decided to take a tour of town in the comfort of my air-conditioned car to see how people were coping. Mostly there were no people to see, coping or otherwise. Wilshire Boulevard was a glaring-white reflective canyon, even emptier of humanity than it normally is. In leafier neighborhoods, only the young and hardy, and one might say foolish, were out on the usual skateboards, bikes, and scooters. People rushed from one air-conditioned space to another, home to pharmacy, restaurant to office.Men had cast off their shirts even on the fanciest streets in Beverly Hills. The parks, which teemed with people during the summer after pandemic restrictions abated, were deserted as the mercury rose uncomfortably close to 100, except for a few tourist groups gathered in the shade of the occasional tree, looking disconsolate and restless. Everyone was thinking about the beach, but really? Up and down the coast, several beaches, including Santa Monica’s, have been declared unsafe because of high bacterial levels.At lunchtime, the pandemic eating areas were empty on the sunny side of streets and sparsely populated even across the way. All through Hollywood and Beverly Hills, fruit vendors on usually busy corners sat quietly behind their silver trolleys, under rainbow umbrellas, without customers. COVID-testing sites were unvisited, populated only by their bedraggled-looking technicians. Pedestrian traffic, always limited in Los Angeles, was almost nonexistent, down to a smattering of blond women in tennis skirts and tank tops, carrying open umbrellas as parasols, who popped in and out of coffee shops and clothing stores on Beverly Drive. Then late afternoon arrived, with its long shadows, and still no respite. No fronds fluttered. The air throughout the city, still in the 90s, was unusually still. Around 9 p.m., the temperature finally dipped back into the 80s and the evening dog walk began.Plenty of people are still trying to live the old laid-back, upscale L.A. lifestyle. If you’re lucky, a small breeze starts up in late evening and you can sit down with a panting dog next to you and have cocktails around the pool or on a shaded lawn—as the drought and the heat waves chip away at the continued existence of these old signifiers. Already, 90 is the new 80. An image I can’t get out of my mind as typifying the whole rotten situation is that of a homeless man who was found one recent morning floating facedown, dead, in a swimming pool in a wealthy, garden-filled neighborhood.Friday night, looking up from a dinner in Hollywood under an open roof sparkling with tiny lights against a dark-blue sky, my son said to me, “Even on the worst day of the year, Los Angeles is perfect.” He knows he’s overstating the case for effect, because he’s only just arrived back here after several years in New York. And he means for people like us, of course, people who don’t yet need to believe that weather is all that matters in a human life.",

        "description": "Where did all the Black people go? If you live in an urban neighborhood and don’t spend your free time looking at the U.S. census, you might ask yourself this question, puzzled by the dissonance between the evidence of your eyes and your vague sense that most Black people live in cities, right? In the U.S., the terms inner city and urban have long been code words for Black areas. They are used to evoke the stereotype of a Black underclass, confined to public-housing units or low-income housing, entrenching the belief that this population is somehow inherently meant for city life while also denigrating city life as dirty, crowded, and utterly undesirable. During the 2016 presidential debates, for instance, then-candidate Donald Trump repeatedly referred to African Americans living in “the inner cities.” When asked about the nation’s racial divide or being a president to “all the people in the United States,” he repeatedly evoked the stereotype that Black people largely live in inner cities wracked by crime.[Read: No, most Black people don’t live in poverty—or inner cities]To make this stereotype work in the 21st century requires overlooking one key fact: Black families have been absconding from cities for decades. In a recent paper, the economists Alex Bartik and Evan Mast note that over the past 50 years, the share of the Black population living in the 40 most populous central cities in the U.S. fell from 40 percent to 24 percent. They are not the first to highlight this phenomenon. Demographers and sociologists in particular have been noting this trend for decades. As the Brookings Institution demographer William Frey has documented, from 2000 to 2010, the Black population of the central cities in America’s 100 largest metro areas decreased by 300,000. Detroit, Chicago, and New York (prime destinations during the Great Migration) as well as Atlanta, Dallas, and Los Angeles all saw declines in their Black populations.What this geographic shift has meant for Black Americans is complicated, and there are many stories to tell—of families moving to opportunity, of inequality replicating itself when they get there, and of the people left behind. In 1968, Congress passed the Fair Housing Act and outlawed discrimination in the housing market. This did not eradicate housing inequality, but it did give Black households much more freedom to actualize their preferences of where to live and whom to live among. More than 50 years later, we are still seeing how those preferences shape the nation’s geography of opportunity.In the early 20th century, in what would come to be called the Great Migration, Black Americans urbanized, eager for the promise of a better life in the North, Midwest, and West. From 1910 to 1970, 6 million people left the Jim Crow South, “seeking political asylum within the borders of their own country, not unlike refugees in other parts of the world fleeing famine, war and pestilence,” the historian Isabel Wilkerson wrote in 2016.Not only the pull of opportunity, but also the push of exclusion acted upon Black migrants. As they fled the South, many white Americans closed ranks around homogenous communities, denying them entry, particularly in the suburbs. Racist housing policies, more than any preference for urban life, shaped 20th-century Black residential trends. These practices were no secret and yet many Americans came to think of crowded, poverty-ridden central cities as a sort of natural environment for Black people, perhaps because this falsehood would seem to justify unequal living conditions.The de jure confinement of Black Americans to cities would become an economic albatross. In the postwar period, employment, once concentrated heavily in city centers, decentralized and spread to the peripheries. As the economists Ed Glaeser and Matt Kahn have written, while in 1940 most jobs were located close to the urban core, by 1996, only 16 percent of jobs were within three miles of a city’s central business district: “The dense, walking city of the 19th century has been replaced by the medium density, driving city of today.”The Berkeley economist Conrad Miller found that job suburbanization harmed Black employment prospects. Following World War II, job growth was primarily relegated to the suburbs, even as Black households largely remained within central cities. Miller’s research shows that for every 10 percent decline in the share of jobs located in the central city, Black employment rates declined 1.3–1.9 percent. White employment rates did not see similar declines.Miller’s research also shows that Black individuals who, against the odds, were able to move to the suburbs in the mid-20th century did significantly better than their counterparts within city limits. From 1930 to 1970, employment rates were basically equal for Black men of working age regardless of whether they lived in the city or in the suburbs. By 1980, a gap had appeared: For urban dwellers in this group, the employment rate was 61.1 percent. For those in the suburbs, it was 10 percentage points higher. This gap widened in 1990 and again in 2000.[Read: American wealth is broken]Those who have noticed Black flight might assume that Black Americans were forced out of the central city because of gentrification, a phenomenon that receives outsize attention—perhaps because those of us who write about cities are disproportionately likely to live in gentrifying neighborhoods. But this narrative doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. If the gentrification story were true, we would expect historically Black neighborhoods to have seen increases in rent and home prices that made staying untenable. We would also expect poorer households to have left cities in greater numbers than their richer counterparts, because they are least able to weather rising costs. Neither of these premises is borne out in the data.In reality, gentrification of majority-Black urban neighborhoods is rare. Most of these areas are caught in a disinvestment and depopulation spiral. Demand pressure is actually the exact thing they desperately need. As Bartik and Mast explain, majority-Black places that had poverty rates above 20 percent in 1970 have lost 60 percent of their Black population since then and 40 percent of their total population. Some 85 percent of the aggregate decline in the urban Black population happened within census tracts that did not gentrify. The Black households that left for the suburbs, moreover, tended to be higher income than those left behind.So what did happen? Black flight isn’t a unique phenomenon, and can be attributed both to job suburbanization and to widespread American preferences for suburban living (not that separating these into two discrete forces is particularly easy).Differences between urban and suburban Black households showed up quickly. Bartik and Mast looked at how Black incomes changed from 1970 to 1990. They found that the neighborhood median income of the average Black person rose from 61 to 66 percent of the average white person’s neighborhood median income. That’s real progress. But these gains were not evenly distributed. In the suburbs, Black relative neighborhood income went up six percentage points before dropping a bit. In cities, that figure declined from 58 percent to 50 percent. The researchers also found that the number of high-socioeconomic-status, majority-Black census tracts more than doubled from 1970 to 2016, and almost all of that growth was in the suburbs.The benefits of suburbanization for Black Americans have not been limited to money, but have also extended more broadly to quality of life. One recent study from the Philadelphia Fed showed that in 1980, Black commuters spent about 50 more minutes commuting each week than their white counterparts. The researchers speculate that “racialized patterns of suburbanization” played a role in this gap as well. By 2019, the difference in commuting times between Black and white workers had dropped by more than half.Black suburbanization hasn’t been a cure-all. As Brookings Institution researchers pointed out in 2010, “by 2008, suburbs were home to the largest and fastest-growing poor population in the country.” Moving to the suburbs “to some extent [means] leaving behind some of the disadvantages” of the city, the Brown University sociologist John Logan explained to me. But “the other side of it … is that there’s a high degree of segregation of people in the suburbs.” In 2014, Logan released a report arguing that inequities in neighborhood character and school quality persisted in the suburbs. But all in all, moving to the suburbs has meant greater access to jobs and improvements in neighborhood incomes.In researching Black suburbanization, I initially focused on the households that moved. I imagined them bravely striking out, pushing through unfair and biased policies, gritting their teeth as they suffered the indignities of racist neighbors, proudly sending their kids to schools better than the ones they had attended. But that’s not the whole story. Black suburbanization isn’t just about the people who left, but also those they left behind.\r\n[Read: Revenge of the suburbs]Before the 1970s, when most high- and middle-income Black households had no choice but to live in cities, they also had no choice but to live alongside low-income households. The implications here are a bit unnerving: Racial segregation gave lower-socioeconomic-status Black households access to interactions with higher-status ones. The unwinding of the legal regime of segregation may have allowed middle-class Black families to separate their fortunes from their lower-income compatriots.  The sociologist William Julius Wilson pulled on this tension in his seminal 1987 book, The Truly Disadvantaged, writing, “I believe that the exodus of middle- and working-class families from many ghetto neighborhoods removes an important ‘social buffer’ that could deflect the full impact of the kind of prolonged and increasing joblessness that plagued inner-city neighborhoods in the 1970s and early 1980s.” Wilson went on to argue that economic integration allows children born into poor families to see a greater range of possibilities for their lives. Even during economic downturns, middle- and working-class families sustain important social institutions like churches, stores, recreational facilities, and schools. Entirely poverty-ridden neighborhoods would struggle to do the same.Now, however, Bartik and Mast note that income segregation among Black households has quickly risen and on typical segregation measures is roughly 50 percent higher when compared with the nation as a whole. That shift is attributable to the fact that lower-income Black families have been largely unable to follow higher-income ones to the suburbs. Bartik and Mast note that, in 1970, for an upper-middle-income household looking to buy a home, 80 percent of the units in their price range were in the suburbs, but for a lower-middle-income renter household, only 20 percent were.(I want to note here the existence of a debate around the data underlying claims of increasing economic segregation. Logan cautioned me to treat these numbers as “tentative,” pointing me to his research unveiling bias due to small sample sizes. In an email, Mast pointed me to corroborating findings that don’t rely on the potentially biased index.)Recent papers by economists at Harvard’s Opportunity Insights lab reveal the importance of economic integration on social and financial mobility. The biggest takeaway from their research is that connections across class lines really matter. The economists estimate that if a child born to a disadvantaged family were to grow up in an area with the “economic connectedness” that children born to advantaged families experience, their income would be 20 percent higher, on average, in adulthood than it would be if they grew up in an entirely poverty-ridden neighborhood.Black families that suburbanized benefited from moving to more economically integrated communities. But the people left behind—disproportionately poor and elderly—were left watching their neighborhoods deteriorate even further, losing population, losing hope.In the late 1990s, Ethiopia expelled tens of thousands of people from its borders. People who had been born in the country, who had served in the government, who had Ethiopian spouses and children, were forced to leave because of some connection to the bordering nation of Eritrea. One contemporaneous report described this as a “deliberate program of mass expulsion” in which many of the victims were never charged with a crime but rounded up, put in prison, bused to the border, and told to walk. Many had their belongings seized and were left penniless in their new home.On national television, then–Prime Minister Meles Zenawi justified the actions by saying, “If the Ethiopian government says, ‘We don’t like the color of their eyes’ and ‘Get out,’ … then they should get out.”I was 3 years old when my family fled Ethiopia preemptively, successfully seeking asylum in the United States and leaving everything behind. In the U.S., this coded as underprivileged. To the people left behind 7,000 miles away, we were unbelievably lucky.Being able to get out is its own kind of marker of privilege. When disaster strikes, people who avoid the worst of it are often the ones with more money, physical ability, education, connections, youth, and, of course, luck. It’s telling that as the number of Black young and middle-aged adults has declined in central cities, the number of those older than 65 has increased significantly.There are two ways to humanely respond to this inescapable fact about the world: You can try to prevent as many disasters as possible, or you can lower the bar to escaping them. If leaving a failing neighborhood or country was cheap or easy, many more people would do so—according to Gallup, 750 million people would migrate to another country if they could. Even within the U.S., declining rates of mobility point to large numbers of people trapped in communities they would likely leave behind if they could.I don’t pretend to know the answer of how to revitalize the places left behind. Reformers could focus on low-hanging fruit to improve quality of life, like eliminating lead and improving air quality or providing the bare-minimum quality of housing. But the graveyard of failed American urban policymaking tells a pessimistic story about the government’s ability and willingness to change the fate of these communities.",

        "description": "Illustrations by Sergiy MaidukovI had no business going to Ukraine. The country didn’t need another reporter to cover the war. Ukrainian journalists were already doing that much better than I could hope to, and so were plenty of foreigners. I had never set foot in Ukraine; I spoke neither of its languages; I was, my children told me, too old to be a war correspondent again. It would be completely pointless to get killed over there. But selfishness is an underrated motive among journalists. I told myself and others that Ukraine is the most important story of our time, that everything we should care about is on the line there. I believed it then, and I believe it now, but all of this talk put a nice gloss on the simple, unjustifiable desire to be there and see.Because these motives seemed dubious, I looked for another way to be useful. Fortunately, a friend who had started an organization called Assist Ukraine needed a courier to bring medical supplies to combat doctors in Lviv and Kyiv. The group sent me its contacts in Ukraine along with the supplies: a dozen junctional tourniquets and 40 pairs of holstered Raptor shears. The tourniquets, which came in khaki-colored nylon pouches and cost $350 each, looked like high-tech seat belts, with a compression pad on either end and a black rubber hand pump attached. Cinched and inflated under the armpits or around the hips, they’re designed to stop massive bleeding from major arteries where the body’s limbs join the trunk.I also received a thick batch of homemade cards from a Ukrainian Catholic elementary school in Chicago, with messages of encouragement in English and Ukrainian and cheerful drawings of sunflowers and blue-and-yellow flags, to be distributed to random soldiers. Some of the schoolchildren were refugees, and many had relatives in the fight. I set out with exactly 50 pounds of donated supplies in a battered black suitcase that I’d been trying to lose.Journalism that waves the banner of moral clarity makes me uneasy. Moral clarity can be blinding, and most subjects worth writing about are complicated. But a few things are morally clear: slavery, and genocide, and Russia’s attempt to destroy Ukraine. The suitcase full of medical supplies didn’t trouble my professional conscience. Nor did the Ukrainian flag my daughter and I painted on white paper and taped to our living-room window. Nor, I have to admit, did the money I sent to Razom, a Ukrainian American charity, and Come Back Alive, a volunteer outfit in Kyiv that provides nonlethal equipment such as night-vision goggles to Ukraine’s armed forces—though by now certain media ethicists would have barred me from going anywhere near Ukraine.It’s absurd to approach this war from a position of neutrality. As a journalistic stance, neutrality is worthless, and usually spurious, because everyone is a partisan of some kind. Objectivity is different: the necessary effort, always doomed to fall short, of rendering reality exactly, like a carpenter striving for plumb, level, and square. What’s most crucial is independence: refusing to surrender your judgment of the truth for the sake of a political cause. Journalism doesn’t require an anesthetized moral faculty. It ought to be possible to want Ukraine to win this war and still tell what you see and hear there honestly.After the Russian invasion, some commentators in the United States expressed a hope that Ukraine’s fight for survival might inspire Americans to rededicate ourselves to renewing our own democracy. Polls showed that a war in Eastern Europe was doing what the pandemic and global warming had failed to do: bring Americans together across partisan lines. You could find the same blue-and-yellow flag planted in the front yard of a ranch house in rural Maine and hung from a parking sign on my Brooklyn street. A country that hardly anyone here knew anything about seemed to offer a model of what we all believe to be good and want for ourselves—courage and freedom and unity. But the model had this power only because it was far away, and its flag’s colors weren’t ours.Want to hear more from George Packer about Russia’s war on Ukraine?

Register and find out more here.In the days before my trip, I had a feeling of nausea that I recognized as dread. Not of the place I was going, but of the place I was leaving behind, of the Let’s Go Brandon signs and the school-board showdowns and the next mass shooting, the prospect that our experiment in people coming from all over to run their own affairs together was finished. For the first time in my life, I felt hopeless about America. And because I have no transcendent beliefs, the loss of this earthly one left a void of meaning that made me sick.Here was another motive—the strongest and most dubious of all. I wanted a gulp of Ukrainian air. I wanted to breathe its hope. What a thing to ask of people fighting for their lives.“Ah!” Olesya Vynnyk closed her eyes and inhaled the factory odor of new nylon from my black suitcase. “I can already smell the American tourniquets!”We were standing by the open trunk of her Audi, on a cobblestone side street near the center of Lviv. Olesya is 31 years old (“same age as Ukraine”), a doctor in internal medicine, with long dark hair and black-framed glasses and skinny jeans and a droll smile. She woke up on the morning of February 24 to the Russian invasion. “My first thought,” she told me, “was that I have to do something.” She threw on some clothes and got in her car and started driving, with no idea where to go. She ended up in downtown Lviv, where she saw someone she knew in the bright-yellow jacket of Motohelp—a local civic group of first responders on motorcycles who reach the scene of accidents ahead of ambulances.“Hey!” Olesya shouted to the Motohelp guy. “Let’s do something!”By the next day she had set aside her medical practice and joined a group of doctors who were instructing the first civilian volunteers of the Territorial Defense Forces in combat medicine. Olesya helped organize Lviv’s Volunteer Medical Battalion, the unit that would receive the junctional tourniquets.\r\nSergiy Maidukov is a Ukrainian illustrator living and working in Kyiv. He has been documenting the war since it began. (Zeitmagazin)\r\n“That was the common idea, that’s who Ukrainians are,” she told me. “We just have to move and do something if we really need it. If the war comes to your home, you cannot just remain silent, you cannot remain still. You have to do something.”On our way to the battalion’s compound, I asked what she was fighting for.“Democracy, a new nation, survival—all together,” Olesya said. “This is a sacred war. It’s everything good against pure evil.” And Ukraine would win, she assured me. She was relentlessly optimistic.At the compound—a children’s recreation center in a residential neighborhood—Olesya gave me a tour of classrooms where medical dummies lay bloody on the floor, and of improvised storage rooms stacked high with cardboard boxes of donated supplies. In the courtyard I met a young truck driver and an even younger graphic designer. At the start of the invasion, both of them had returned from jobs in Poland to volunteer.I asked if they expected to win.“We don’t even think about anything else,” the graphic designer said. “We need victory. Not-victory is not even in the mind. We have no choice.”“It’s up to the outside world to help or not,” Olesya said. “But we will still win this war. It will be much easier with the help of the international friends. We’re trying to do a really huge thing: to build a new country while we fight the war. When we win, it will be beautiful.”Didn’t they feel angry and tired?“We are angry,” the graphic designer said. “We are tired.”“We are doing this, but with a huge cost to the life of our soldiers,” Olesya said. “Sometimes it feels like too much. We will cry a bit later, after we win the war.”Lviv, a lovely Habsburg town, had been turned into a refugee center and logistics hub, with tent camps in open fields, windows of 18th-century buildings sandbagged, and donated material piled up everywhere. It was all a little helter-skelter—no central department masterminded orders, inventory, or distribution. An ancient Greek Catholic church stored flak vests in a room off the entryway and boxes of boots in a loft next to the defunct organ. Father Andrew, the youthful priest, sometimes changed out of his black cassock into street clothes and drove military materiel some 700 miles across Ukraine, to the front. In the first 80 days of the war he had officiated at almost 70 funerals.A whole society mobilized: This was my first, and most lasting, impression. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, described Ukraine in crisis as “a beehive.” Nearly everyone I met had looked for something to do as soon as Russia attacked—some way to be useful without waiting for instructions from a higher authority. In Lviv a young behavioral scientist and serial entrepreneur named Sviatoslav Hnizdovskyi used his professional network to create the Open Minds Institute, beginning a campaign of phone calls to ordinary people in Russia, family members of soldiers fighting in Ukraine, with the aim of slowly puncturing the Kremlin’s bubble of lies. On the day the invasion started, Vira Krutilina, a sculptor, and Dmytro Levenko, a theatrical-lighting designer, went to volunteer at a local Territorial Defense post in Kyiv and were given instant training in the use of AK‑47s. Neither had ever fired a gun in their life, but within 24 hours they were standing on a rooftop in the north of the capital, scouting the streets below for the first Russian tanks. Vira described these early months of the war as “a magical time. People are connected with each other in a way we normally aren’t, and connected to people we would never be connected to.” She admitted that, on some level, she dreaded the day when the air-raid sirens would no longer go off.The word Ukrainians use for all this spontaneous activity is self-organization.“I think self-organization comes from an idea of community which is very deep in our culture,” Volodymyr Yermolenko, a philosopher and journalist, told me. “In Ukrainian we call it hromada. The idea is that politics is about horizontal relations between people and not about vertical relations of power.” He traced the political concept to a circle of 19th-century intellectuals in Kyiv, and the spirit of community even further back, to the self-governing Cossacks of the 17th-century steppe.[George Packer: I worry we’ll soon forget about Ukraine]“I wouldn’t dig so far back as the Cossacks—maybe go back to the Soviet time,” Stanislav Lyachynskyy, an activist who works on projects to strengthen Ukrainian civil society, told me. This tradition of self-organization came from the “mutual networks of survival from the 1980s, when there was a deficit of goods, and from the ’90s, when the old economy collapsed.” Both Lyachynskyy and Yermolenko observed that Russia, from the czars through the Soviet Union to the revanchist reign of Vladimir Putin, has always ruled its vast empire of nations from an authoritarian center, with power strictly vertical. In Ukraine, where the struggle for an independent identity was repressed for centuries, suspicion toward central power runs deep.In 2014, when Ukrainians in Kyiv’s Maidan rallied to overthrow their corrupt Russian-backed president, Viktor Yanukovych, pressure from below for sweeping reforms intensified—for the rule of law, against corruption. But the Revolution of Dignity was far from universally popular. Not even Russia’s subsequent annexation of Crimea and the eight-year separatist insurgency in the Donbas region could fully overcome the historical divisions in Ukraine’s conflicting pulls toward democratic Europe and autocratic Russia.Then came February 24. From the first hours of the Russian invasion, self-organization characterized the response. Towns and villages spontaneously set up what Ukrainians call “block posts,” manned by armed civilians in Territorial Defense units. When Lyachynskyy drove his family three hours south from Kyiv to the relative safety of his sister’s house in central Ukraine, they passed 15 or 20 of these block posts. Some were built with sandbags, others with tires, lumber, concrete blocks, even steel anti-tank obstacles. “Every block post is unique,” Yermolenko said.A number of Ukrainians blamed the local and national governments for failing to arm civilians in advance in towns—Bucha in the north, Kherson in the south—that fell immediately. Where early resistance succeeded, it was partly due to the ability of Ukraine’s armed forces and civilian defenses to seize advantages without waiting for orders from higher up. Where Russian troops became occupying forces, as in Kherson, they were faced with a local population that they couldn’t understand. “They didn’t know the real active leaders on the ground, so they pulled people off the street in huge numbers,” Serhiy Danylov, a researcher who spent years working in Kherson, told me. “The Russians asked the same questions of the activists they arrested: ‘Who is the organizer? Who is paying for all this? Who is behind it?’ They didn’t believe in spontaneous protest and self-organization.”\r\nZeitmagazin\r\nLater, when the war shifted to an artillery duel in the east, where Russia flattened entire towns and Ukrainian forces were badly outmatched, self-organization was less effective. But the Russian invasion has elevated the idea of hromada from local communities to the whole country. By killing Ukrainians regardless of their region or language or politics, Russia is helping forge Ukraine into something it’s never been—a national community.Olesya Vynnyk commandeered nine of the tourniquets, as well as the 40 pairs of Raptor shears. The next day, another volunteer would drive them across the country to troops on the Donbas front. My instructions were to take the remaining tourniquets to Kyiv.Before going there, I spent a day following Olesya around Lviv’s hospitals. I was told not to take pictures, or even name the hospitals, for fear of identifying them as targets for missile attacks. (Russia has destroyed or damaged hundreds of medical facilities across Ukraine, along with schools, libraries, theaters, and cultural centers.) Some hospitals were still in decrepit, post-Soviet condition, but others were being renovated to European standards, with state-of-the-art cardiology facilities and MRI machines. All of this improvement was going on in spite of the fact that it could be obliterated in an instant.One hospital I visited was caring for dozens of wounded soldiers and civilians from the east. The hospital director asked me not to interview the fighters: Most of them were suffering from trauma and extremely depressed to be stuck here, away from their units. So instead I went room to room with my batch of homemade cards. It was a rather mortifying errand. Soldiers in their underwear, lying or sitting on hospital beds in bare-bones rooms, faces bandaged, white tape wrapped around shrapnel wounds in their legs and arms, glanced up without interest or with resentment at a stranger intruding on their private pain. They took the cards I handed out and opened the envelopes, showing glimmers of curiosity. They tried to make sense of the handwritten scrawl, most of it in English, of Chicago schoolchildren. I left a few of them faintly smiling.In a room with yellow walls and a view of the suburban hills there was an old couple, Ivan Yakovenko and Nataliia Sukhina, who had just been evacuated from a town in the Donbas called Popasna. Their house no longer existed, and neither did their town. At the start of the invasion they had waited too long to flee—“We thought it would be like 2014,” Nataliia said: “Some houses damaged, but not on this scale.” For two months they were trapped in their house, without electricity, windows shattered, caught in the cross fire of constant shelling. They lost all contact with their children and grandchildren, who lived on the side of town under Russian occupation. A 67-year-old neighbor was taken away at gunpoint and deported to Russia. Ivan, a retired factory worker, drove part-time for a funeral service, and for a few weeks he collected bodies around town that had begun to decompose.Before dawn on April 26, a shell landed on their house and buried them in rubble. Popasna had by then become the small-scale Stalingrad that Russian forces created everywhere. The couple was dug out and evacuated to Lviv. They had no money, no clothes, nothing.Ivan, bearded, missing most of his teeth, a flannel shirt hanging off his skinny shoulders, sat on a bed in utter bewilderment. “We don’t know where we’re going next,” he said. “There’s nothing to go back to.” The trauma had left his wife unable to walk, and she lay under a bedsheet from which a catheter extended. Her left arm was covered in bruises, her left hand was missing two fingers, and her cheeks were wet. But Nataliia was not too broken to fume. When I asked what she thought of Putin’s promise to “liberate” Russian speakers like them in the Donbas, her blue eyes hardened, the red in her cheeks deepened, and she answered, for the first time, in Ukrainian: “Let him drop dead. We had a good life without him.”Ivan and Nataliia, like the soldiers separated from their units, were alone, and being alone and helpless rendered their suffering meaningless. Self-organization connected people to one another with a purpose that made the war more bearable. It shaped an expression that I associated with Ukrainian faces: open, direct, uningratiating, a little tough but on the verge of being amused—alive. People walked fast. Armed men and women in uniform were a natural part of the population, hardly separable from civilians, and it was strange to be constantly in their presence, on trains, in cafés, and feel no danger except from the sky. In America a uniformed soldier among civilians is a curiosity, and a young man with a semiautomatic weapon is not a welcome sight. I needed a few days to realize why a Ukrainian city felt somehow less tense than an American one: It was because you knew no Ukrainian was going to shoot you, and everyone you met was on the same side.While I was with the wounded, Olesya disappeared to see a military friend who had suffered a serious head injury at the front. When she returned, her easy smile was gone. As we drove back to town, she played a music video that had been posted to YouTube in April by the armed forces—clips of badass military action set to a heavy dubstep score. The song’s title, and its refrain, was “Don’t Fuck With Ukraine.” Olesya, a devout Greek Catholic, apologized for the language but said she found the song helpful.I had come from a country where the bonds of trust have been worn down to nothing, where earnest declarations about building a new country while winning a war can’t be swallowed without a heavy dose of irony, and where cynicism is a protective reflex against these losses. So, as an American, I had begun to question Olesya’s cheerful optimism. Yet almost every Ukrainian I met shared it: “We will win.” And also: “No compromise.”After the hospital, as we drove through Lviv’s pretty, sunlit streets to the beat of “Don’t Fuck With Ukraine,” I understood a bit better. The song—Olesya called it “the music of war and marching”—made her feel brave and resolute. It was like that bit of bravado from the war’s first days, “Russian warship, go fuck yourself,” which had practically become a national motto, printed on posters and chocolate wrappers and inspiring a collectible stamp. Ukrainians need to be brave and resolute, because they face immense odds against winning and terrible consequences if they lose, and meanwhile every day brings crushing loss. There can be no compromise because the alternative, they’ve learned, is annihilation. Shouts of “Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!” might make certain European bureaucrats and American pundits smile with uneasy condescension, but Ukraine under invasion is not a place where the clever refinements of a detached intelligence have much use.In Kyiv one night, I was invited to dinner by the Svystovych family. They were staying in the apartment of friends who had left at the start of the war. The Svystovychs’ home—in Irpin, the northern suburb that, along with Bucha, had been a front line of occupation and become the site of mass killings before the Russians were repelled—lay in ruins. Mykhaylo Svystovych was a business consultant and civic activist with unruly gray hair and a middle-aged belly and squinting eyes behind thick glasses. He had participated in every popular movement since the 1990 student hunger strike that helped lead to Ukraine’s overwhelming vote for independence from the Soviet Union. Myroslava, his wife, was a real-estate agent, with the wide cheekbones and long straight hair of so many Ukrainian women. She had once served briefly as Irpin’s mayor before being voted out (she said she was pushed out for standing up against corrupt land deals). Their son, Yaroslav, was 24 and studying IT. Their daughter, Lada, 22, was still recovering from a Russian bullet wound in her side; she smiled throughout the meal but didn’t say a word. The family also had two dogs, including a pointy-eared stray they’d adopted at the start of the invasion, and a black cat missing its left eye. The pets turned out to be the key to the story the family told me over borscht, lamb, rice, and Bison Grass vodka, while a television in the corner aired continuous war news.In Irpin they had lived in two cramped rooms on the ground floor of a two-story complex. When the Russian invaders approached from Belarus, the Svystovychs decided to stay put, because the Ukrainian forces seemed to be holding their own. The Svystovychs didn’t want to abandon their elderly neighbors. And anyway, the family had no car.Many Ukrainians I asked, like Afghans in Kabul just before the arrival of the Taliban, simply didn’t believe that the Russians would start a full-scale war. There’s a profound resistance to imagining the end of everything you know. Some people from the Donbas who had already fled the Russians once, in 2014, refused to run again. Some Ukrainians couldn’t imagine the brutality that lay in store for them until it was too late. “You always wait until you have only 15 minutes,” Stanislav Lyachynskyy, the civic activist in Kyiv, said. “You see the otherness of your flat, your world. You are still here, but your previous life is just faded away. And you have 15 minutes.”By March 6, the Svystovych family had no power or water. That day, a shell exploded in the yard, 75 feet from their apartment. Myroslava was standing by the stove at the moment the kitchen window blew in and filled her hair with bits of glass. Mykhaylo had just taken a step back from the bedroom window, and shrapnel peppered the walls around him. A piece ricocheted off a wall into the bathroom and chipped the bathtub, just missing Lada. Given the tiny size of the rooms and the thousands of flying glass and metal fragments, it was miraculous that no one was hurt, except the cat, which took a piece of glass in the eye.A few hours later a second shell landed in the yard, doing more damage to the building’s exterior. The apartment was now too cold for habitation, and the family spent the night with others in the basement of a jewelry shop. Even then, they didn’t intend to leave. But the next day they could find no veterinarians left in town. Lada insisted that they had to evacuate the wounded cat to Kyiv.On the afternoon of March 7, the Svystovych family tried to get out of Irpin. Their phones were almost dead, so they didn’t know that Russian troops were only 200 yards away. The family split up into three evacuation cars driven by volunteers—Yaroslav with the stray, Mykhaylo with the other dog, and Myroslava and Lada with the wounded cat in a carrier. But on the way out of Irpin the women’s car left the convoy and ran straight into Russian troops. Suddenly the windshield exploded. Myroslava screamed for Lada to get down. The driver fell out through his door—he’d been shot—and the car rolled half a mile downhill until it slowed enough for Myroslava to jump out. She shouted for Lada to do the same, but the cat carrier was in the way and Lada had trouble moving—there was something heavy in her right side. When the car finally stopped, she managed to get out, bringing the cat with her.Myroslava couldn’t reach Mykhaylo—his phone was dead—so she tried to call a friend. Russian troops, their faces masked, were approaching on foot. Myroslava cried out for help.“Who are you calling?”“My husband.”A soldier took her phone and crushed it under his boot.The Russians ordered Myroslava and Lada to walk to a nearby road where they were picked up by an evacuation car. By then it was clear that Lada had been shot. She was weakening fast, and at the Irpin River she had to be carried over the temporary wooden crossing that had replaced the blown-up bridge to Kyiv. Lada was taken by ambulance to a city hospital, where doctors repaired her perforated intestine just in time to save her life.A few weeks later, Ukrainian forces pushed the Russians out of the area around Kyiv, and the Svystovych family returned to check on their apartment. It was in ruins, along with much of the suburb. Neighbors told them that Russians had defecated on the floors. One neighbor found the amputated leg of a Russian soldier in his house. He brought the leg to the local authorities, but no one knew what to do with it, so the neighbor wrapped it in plastic and left it between the bars of a fence. Eventually someone took the Russian leg away, as if this part of the tale had been invented by the Ukrainian native Nikolai Gogol himself.As the family told their story over dinner and vodka, they kept exchanging glances and laughing, amazed and relieved at having survived the ordeal, and the two dogs prowled around the table for handouts, and the one-eyed cat dozed in a chair, and the TV news reported that the siege of Mariupol was ending, and there was an incongruous lightness in the room, even when Mykhaylo laid on the table a fistful of rust-colored, jagged-edged pieces of Russian shrapnel from the apartment in Irpin. He placed one in my hand. I have it beside me now.The next day I accompanied Mykhaylo and his friend Serhiy Glynianyi, a former Irpin councilman, on a mission to bring supplies to elderly people in their town. On the road out of Kyiv, where sandbags and anti-tank obstacles marked the farthest point of the Russian advance on the capital, we stopped to buy groceries. One minute we were in a modern European supermarket, with a brightly lit cheese counter and shoppers unloading their carts at the checkout belts and cashiers efficiently scanning items. A few minutes later we drove into a cozy suburban neighborhood that had become a scene of destruction. Broken stucco walls, gabled roofs caved in, tan brick facades blackened by fire, wrecked furniture in rooms open to the sky, a pile of corrugated iron in a yard, someone’s car left by the roadside with flat tires and shattered windshields, its body riddled with bullet holes.Every street was like this.On some streets one house lay in rubble while its next-door neighbor 10 feet away was perfectly intact, as if the victims had been determined by some malevolent lottery. “It seemed like they had to hit one house in every neighborhood,” Ighor Glynianyi, Serhiy’s son, said when we stopped by his house. His neighbor’s house was in ruins, while his had sustained only light damage. “Keep away from the fields,” Ighor, a recruiter for Ukrainian technology companies, told us. “They mined everything—even children’s pianos and toys.” There were skull-and-crossbones warnings at the edge of the forest. Recently, an old man had ventured down a path into the woods and stepped on a mine.We drove along Dostoyevsky Street. Someone had spray-painted black over the Russian author’s name on the sign.Three old women were sitting in the yard outside Mykhaylo’s flat. He handed out bags of provisions and medicine, and the women kissed his hand. In the apartment, the food Myroslava had been preparing when the shell hit still lay scattered about the kitchen. Water was leaking from a broken pipe onto the floor. Mykhaylo ignored it. He had more errands. A bag with cooking oil and water for an old woman who was waiting for him in a veterinary office. Thyroid medicine for a younger woman we encountered on a shopping street. Pills for an old bald man in a tiny, sour-smelling seventh-floor apartment. Anatoly Sherstyuk had been unable to evacuate because his wife is paralyzed. He had been an artilleryman in the Soviet army, and now he had Russian shrapnel in his foot from a shell that landed nearby while he was cooking on an open fire in the yard. Limping to the door, he chuckled at the irony.We crossed over into Bucha. According to Mykhaylo, the Russians had killed 300 people in Irpin—there were still unidentified bodies in the morgue and graves being discovered. In Bucha the number killed was more than 450. Both suburbs had become shorthand for Russian war crimes.[Franklin Foer: Who defines Russia’s atrocities in Bucha?]a bench outside a high-rise complex I spoke with a Bucha councilwoman named Kateryna Ukraintseva. She had short black hair and tired green eyes, and she wore the green fleece of the Territorial Defense Forces. She’d spent the first two weeks of the invasion as a spotter on her rooftop, reporting the movement of Russian troops and helicopters that were landing at nearby Hostomel Airport, and guiding evacuation convoys. When the water was cut off, she and her neighbors drank melted snow. She told me that Bucha fell quickly, and that was why the physical destruction wasn’t as great as in Irpin, though the human losses were worse. When her activities were discovered, she went into hiding, and then escaped the town.“We need Javelins,” she said, referring to American-made anti-tank missiles, “to cover Hostomel Airport.”Did she think the Russians might come back?“They might. You never know.” She smiled wryly. “We need the U.S. to do a bin Laden operation.”It took me a moment to realize whom she intended as the target of the operation.I spent the next day in another Kyiv suburb, Brovary, to the east. The villages around it had endured weeks of occupation. Special police investigators from Lithuania were filming a destroyed school to gather evidence of war crimes. Even the unoccupied neighborhoods were in ruins from random artillery fire. In one village a man showed me how his house had been spared thanks to the community library across the street, which had stood in a shell’s path and taken a direct hit. Its broken walls exposed a mass grave of books.“These targets have no military value,” the lucky homeowner pointed out, superfluously.After two days in Kyiv’s suburbs, buildings in rubble began to seem normal, while an intact street looked artificial, like a deceptively pretty painting, and the sight of a child anywhere around the capital was almost startling. Compared with Kharkiv or Mariupol, the scale of this destruction was fairly small. The cost of rebuilding Ukraine will be staggering—some estimates put it at $1 trillion—and so will the effort to revive its shattered economy. The Russian way of war is a form of shock and awe whose intended effect is not just to leave cities and towns uninhabitable and undefended, but to overwhelm the survivors and render them utterly passive, as if they are facing not a recognizable human enemy but a force of nature, or some kind of supernatural power, an impersonal god that destroys whatever it touches.But one evening something happened that put me in a different frame of mind. I was walking back to my hotel along Khreshchatyk, the main avenue that runs through Kyiv’s Maidan. The streets were nearly empty as the 10 o’clock curfew approached. An air-raid siren began to wail. Few Kyivans paid the alarms much attention anymore, but I quickened my pace. I passed two women in the orange uniforms of city workers. At this hour, they were sweeping out the gutters. I suddenly realized that Kyiv’s streets were incredibly clean, with hardly a scrap of trash anywhere. A lot of effort went into keeping the city, with its broad squares and grand facades in pale blues and pinks and yellows, orderly and pleasing. Everywhere you looked, lilac bushes were in bloom—they were blooming all around the ruins of Irpin and Bucha, too, and along the embankments of the railroad tracks between Lviv and Kyiv—and chestnut trees were covered in shaggy white flowers, and beds of red and yellow tulips spread out around monuments. None of this was natural, any more so than the destruction that artillery and missiles rained down on innocent people going about their lives. Human hands had tried to ruin the city, and human hands were keeping the ruins beautiful.I had heard that so many people wanted to help clear the rubble from Ukraine’s destroyed cities, wait lists were needed to organize all the volunteers. But somehow it was the sight of those two women sweeping the street just before curfew that brought home to me the obscene wrongness of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Here was a country with a tragic history that had at last begun to build, with great effort, a better society. What made Ukraine different from any other country I had ever seen—certainly from my own—was its spirit of constant self-improvement, which included frank self-criticism. For example, there’s no cult of Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine—a number of Ukrainians told me that he had made mistakes, that they’d vote against him after the war was won. Maxim Prykupenko, a hospital director in Lviv, called Ukraine “a free country aspiring to be better all the time.” The Russians, he added, “are destroying a beautiful country for no logical reason to do it. Maybe they are destroying us just because we have a better life.”Shitting on the floor of a newly renovated house after killing or driving out its owners—that, in an image, is Russia’s war against Ukraine.Babyn Yar, where the Nazis killed 33,771 Kyivan Jews on September 29 and 30, 1941, is a stretch of urban parkland cut through by a series of ravines that were once part of an immense pit. In 1976, after decades of silence, the Soviet Union built a monument there to “Soviet” victims of the Nazis. After independence, memorials to other victims—children, Romani, Ukrainian nationalists—were added to the site. The fact that most of the dead were Jewish is acknowledged only by a single monument in the shape of a menorah, placed by Ukrainian Jews in 1991. To this day Ukraine has not looked the Holocaust—and the collaboration of Ukrainians who participated in the mass killings—fully in the face.In 2016, the Ukrainian government announced plans for a $100 million state-of-the-art museum and research center that would supposedly do justice to Babyn Yar. Much of the funding would come from Jewish oligarchs, who had ties to Russia. The first elements, by international artists such as Marina Abramović, were a travesty of narcissistic kitsch. Olena Styazhkina, a historian from Donetsk, told me that she saw the project not as an honest memorial but as Russian propaganda—a cynical attempt to highlight the crimes of the past as a way to suggest that present-day Ukraine remained anti-Semitic. The Russian-backed project would help buttress the falsehood that Ukraine was a neo-Nazi state, which became Russia’s chief pretext for invading.On the street outside the unfinished research center, as if to remind visitors that innocents continue to be slaughtered here, were the remains of a fitness club and an ice rink—twisted steel and tangled wires, fallen branches and blackened tree trunks, all stinking of char—where, in the first days of the invasion, a Russian rocket had missed its intended target, the television tower across the road. Much more than the park’s smorgasbord of monuments, the bitter smell of things not meant for burning made me think of cruelty and death. In the woods at the far edge of Babyn Yar, a few hundred yards and 80 years away, a steep brown gash in the earth had the same effect.I asked Alla Zamanska, a Jewish television director in her 60s, how Babyn Yar should be memorialized. “It has to be an empty place, with only a menorah where there’s a natural ravine,” she said, “and people can bring candles, and that’s enough.”Alla lives with her husband, Mark Belorusets, who is also Jewish, in a narrow, book-filled apartment in central Kyiv. My friend with Assist Ukraine, the group that had given me the tourniquets, asked me to bring the couple some basic supplies—pain-management kits, catheters—as a way for them to thank the Kyiv hospital that had just removed part of Mark’s cancerous lung. He sat at the kitchen table, gaunt and fragile, with his bald head in his hands, while Alla served tea and pastries.They had stayed here throughout the invasion. “I couldn’t have left,” Alla said, “knowing some people would be killed, some places destroyed in this city where I’m so attached.”Alla exists only because her mother was evacuated from Kyiv to Tajikistan at the start of the German invasion; her father fled Ukraine to serve with the Red Army in the Arctic Circle. By the vagaries of Soviet history, Alla had been born in Siberia and spoke Russian. “From the very moment of independence in 1991,” she said, “Ukrainian anti-Semitism has started to disappear.”“Diminish,” Mark corrected.“Face-to-face it continued, but not from the state. No Jews could work for the U.S.S.R.-era state radio. But our daughter worked there.”“Ukraine has a historical anti-Semitism,” Mark insisted.Alla explained that each republic in the Soviet Union had a “titular nation”—the dominant ethnic group that gave the republic its name. Until very recently, Ukrainian nationalism had been based on Ukrainian ethnicity. It was strongest in the west of Ukraine, and it excluded Jews, Poles, Tatars, and Ukraine’s second-largest ethnic group, Russians. The Revolution of Dignity in 2014 began to change the idea of the nation’s identity from an ethnic to a civic one. “During Maidan, the first person killed was ethnic Armenian; the second was from Belarus,” Alla told me. “This somehow erased the Soviet idea of the ‘titular nation.’ ” In 2019, Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly to elect a Jewish president.Ukraine’s democratic transformation is far from complete, but the invasion greatly accelerated and was, in a way, motivated by it. The idea of a nation that includes all of its citizens as equals directly threatens Putin’s Russia—as a model of a post-Soviet democracy, a challenge to Russian imperialism, and a refutation of the “neo-Nazi” charge with which Putin justified his invasion. Ukraine’s far right has a much greater presence in Russian propaganda than in Ukrainian politics. Right-wing nationalists won barely 2 percent of the vote in the 2019 parliamentary election, far lower than their shares in most European countries; the paramilitary units that arose with the start of the war in 2014, such as the notorious Azov Battalion, have mostly assimilated into the country’s regular armed forces.It is impossible to know what public opinion is like in the occupied regions, but Russian behavior can hardly have won the hearts and minds of Ukraine’s Russian speakers in the east and south. Ukraine’s present unity is unprecedented, but war—always intolerant of complexity and ambivalence—is pushing Ukrainians to construct an identity that is simpler than the country’s history. The war will not resolve the abiding question of what it means to be Ukrainian.Just outside the wall of Lychakiv Cemetery in Lviv, where military and cultural heroes from history are buried, there’s a field with dozens of fresh graves dug since February: mounds of dry dirt covered in flowers, small bottles of colored glass, crosses, portraits and names of the dead. Here Rests Soldier Kmitb Yaroslav Romanovych 04.06.2004–05.04.2022. Eternal Memory. They are decorated with the ubiquitous blue-and-yellow flags, as well as a few red-and-black ones. These are the flags of the armed wing of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, an insurgent movement of the ’30s and ’40s in what is now western Ukraine, which fought against first Polish and then Soviet rule. A stone’s throw from the new graves, actual members of that movement lie buried against the cemetery wall.Their leader was a radical nationalist named Stepan Bandera. In 1941 he and his fighters collaborated with the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. But when the OUN sought Hitler’s blessing for an independent and ethnically pure Ukrainian state, Bandera was arrested by the Nazis and spent most of the rest of the war in a concentration camp near Berlin, while in western Ukraine his insurgent army massacred Poles and Jews. Years after the war, Bandera was murdered by a KGB agent in Munich. By almost any definition he was a fascist, but he still has a passionate following among some western Ukrainians, who have erected Bandera statues and museums throughout the region. At the same time, he’s a useful tool for Russian propaganda.Alla Zamanska was the one who put me in touch with Vira Krutilina and Dmytro Levenko, the sculptor and lighting designer. They worked together at a cultural center named after Les Kurbas, a theater director of the ’20s and ’30s who belonged to the Executed Renaissance—a generation of anti-Stalinist writers and artists in Ukraine who were murdered by the Soviet regime. A play of the same name had just been performed in the center’s basement—for safety reasons—in a room now crowded with boxes of food that five young actors were busily assembling into delivery bags. Outside, Vira and Dmytro were having a smoke on a small fenced-in terrace. They were surrounded by a dozen identical plaster busts, made by Vira, of a man with a weak chin, stern frown, and fanatically staring eyes. I immediately recognized Stepan Bandera.Smiling, slouching, hands in the pockets of her torn and plaster-spattered jeans, Vira didn’t seem like a fascist. When I asked about Bandera’s views, she had little to say. To her he was just a symbol of resistance—the plaster equivalent of “Don’t Fuck With Ukraine” and “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.” The more Russia invoked Bandera as a pretext for “de-Nazifying” Ukraine, the more popular he became. Vira could hardly keep up with requests from Territorial Defense units. The busts were a contribution to the war effort.When I mentioned Vira’s Bandera project to Alla, she wasn’t bothered. “He’s no longer seen as a historical person,” she said. “He’s become a myth, made by Russia.”Babyn Yar and Bandera are bound up together in Ukraine’s unresolved history. Decades of Soviet repression, then decades of a chaotic and contested independence, made it almost impossible to grapple openly with their meaning. The Russian invasion brought a surge of civic feeling, but along with solidarity and self-organization came a burning hatred of all things Russian, whether Putin or Pushkin, and open contempt for the Russian people, who are widely regarded as Putin’s slaves. Streets and landmarks named after famous Russians have been rechristened, the special status accorded Russian literature is fading, and in Kyiv, a largely Russian-speaking city (in the Soviet system, Russian was the language of career advancement), Ukrainian is becoming dominant, especially among the young.Olena Styazhkina, the historian from Donetsk, fled the Donbas amid heavy shelling not long after the start of the pro-Russian insurgency in 2014. She asked herself how, if she lost and regained consciousness, she would know she was safe: “If the people around me spoke Ukrainian.” She called Russian, her native tongue, “a weapon of death and blood. I don’t want to speak Russian anymore.” Instead she has taught herself to speak and write in Ukrainian. Styazhkina predicted that Russian would gradually disappear from Ukraine.I wondered how postwar Ukraine would make a place for its uprooted, its occupied, its citizens with lingering attachments to Russia. Would people who had survived the Russians in Donetsk or Mariupol come under suspicion as collaborators? Would there have to be—as one Ukrainian told me—large population transfers, questionable Ukrainians sent to Russia and others resettled in their place, like in the old days of the Soviet Union? Then what would be left of the democratic struggle that continued alongside the war?None of these questions—which are about the country’s past as well as its future—can be answered while Ukraine is fighting for survival. But I took some hope from the responses I heard whenever I asked what the war was about. “From the Ukrainian perspective, and also from the Russian perspective, this is certainly not about religion, not about a piece of land, not about natural resources,” Oleksandr Sushko, the executive director of the International Renaissance Foundation, an organization promoting democracy in Ukraine, told me. “Normally war is about something like this. But here it is not. It is not even about the ethnicity. But it becomes very clear what this conflict is about if you talk about democracy to the people who represent different sides of this war.” Someone on the Russian side, he went on, would tell you that democracy was a manipulative fairy tale. But “when you ask a Ukrainian what this battle is about, he will tell you this is not about ethnic belonging but this is about freedoms, free choice, and the right to determine your life.”It wasn’t hard to meet American volunteers in Ukraine. In a hospital corridor in Lviv I ran into an anesthesiologist and Navy veteran from Chicago named Rom Stevens. In a cemetery in Irpin, where the civilian victims of Russian atrocities lay buried alongside fallen soldiers in rows of fresh graves, I met a retired paratrooper from Portland, Oregon, named Paul Wall; the International Legion had declined to admit him, so he was driving supplies to Ukrainian troops on the Kherson front. On a long train ride I fell into conversation with a former Green Beret from Texas named Ramiro Carrasco Jr., who had just spent 10 weeks training Ukrainian snipers at a base outside Kyiv. These men were in their 50s and 60s. They had left behind families and jobs, and paid their own way to Ukraine.The reasons they gave for coming were simple and personal. When Ukraine didn’t fall at the start of the invasion, Carrasco thought: I’m here sitting in my beautiful home watching this on TV, and they’re over there fighting to save their home. “I needed to go,” he told me. Stevens had been about to embark on a two-month sailing trip with a Navy buddy when they looked at each other and said: “We can’t go sailing when people are fighting and dying and we can do something to help.” Unlike humanitarians, these men had chosen sides. Europe seemed to have something to do with it—they didn’t go off to risk their lives on behalf of Ethiopians or Yemenis. “Wars in Africa—we don’t really assimilate them,” Wall said. “But I lived in England, it’s Europe, we’re all brothers.” Racial identity has played an undeniable role in the outpouring of Western support for Ukraine, and perhaps it tarnishes the value of the support. All of us should care more when those doing the dying aren’t blond-haired and blue-eyed or parking a bike share as the missiles explode.But the motives of these men were, broadly speaking, political. A tyrannical Goliath was trying to kill a democratic David. That’s why Ukraine was worth the risk. Anyone with a human heartbeat who came and saw knew it. “They’re fighting for an ideal,” Stevens said: to “determine their own government, their religion, their culture.” Carrasco put it in more basic terms. “Slaves can never defeat free people—it can never happen,” he said. “Putin made a big mistake. He didn’t know these people. Once a man tastes the taste of freedom, he won’t let anyone take it from him.”I didn’t know what these men thought of American politics, and I didn’t want to know. Back home we might have argued; we might have detested each other. Here, we were joined by a common belief in what the Ukrainians were trying to do and admiration for how they were doing it. Here, all the complex infighting and chronic disappointments and sheer lethargy of any democratic society, but especially ours, dissolved, and the essential things—to be free and live with dignity—became clear. It almost seemed as if the U.S. would have to be attacked or undergo some other catastrophe for Americans to remember what Ukrainians have known from the start.Volodymyr Rafeyenko, one of Ukraine’s most important novelists, fled west to Kyiv from his hometown, Donetsk, in 2014; in March he had to flee west again, this time from his temporary home in a friend’s cottage in Bucha. Rafeyenko has lost almost everything to Russia’s war. “It’s a bad idea to have to face invasion in order to remember values,” he told me when we met in Ternopil, his latest dwelling place. “Not recommended by those who experience it.” He added that, by arming Ukraine, Americans might regain the values they’ve lost without having to endure war. Rafeyenko was offering democratic renewal at a reasonable price.But Ukraine can’t solve America’s problems. We wouldn’t know what to do with their values, and they don’t need ours. What Ukraine needs is our weapons.The U.S. has provided just enough of them just fast enough to keep Ukraine alive, but not enough to give it a chance of winning. For months, the Biden administration, not wanting to provoke Russia, delayed sending long-range precision rocket launchers that Ukraine desperately sought. The administration finally agreed to send the equipment, and it arrived in late June, but soon after that Russia achieved a breakthrough in the Donbas, seizing all of the region of Luhansk and much of Donetsk. With the help of the new weapons, Ukraine began to turn the tide, but the needless delay had a high cost in lives, territory, infrastructure, and momentum.Before I left Ukraine, Olesya Vynnyk put me in touch with her friend Ighor Kholodylo, a paramedic and sergeant in the National Guard. We met outside his battalion headquarters and went to have coffee at a nearby hole-in-the-wall. He had a trim salt-and-pepper beard and keen eyes, and was about to return to the front after two weeks off. I gave him the last three tourniquets.“This is an artillery war,” Ighor said. “They have 220-millimeter shells; they can cut trees in half. I’ve been looking for these for such a long time.” He met my eyes. “We lost troops because we didn’t have these.”I don’t know if Ukraine can win this war, but I know it must. Putin’s Russia is committing crimes that have not been seen in Europe since Hitler and Stalin—leveling cities, terror-bombing civilian populations, creating millions of refugees, using rape and torture to break the will of those under occupation, separating families, detaining and interrogating at least 1 million Ukrainians and sending many to far-off internment camps, preparing to annex entire regions, erasing their language and culture, burning crops, using vital food and energy supplies to blackmail the world. If Western leaders are too afraid of Putin and their own voters to stop him and punish him for these crimes, he’ll know that the West is as weak and pleasure-seeking as he’s always believed. He’ll go on taking more of Ukraine, and then the region, in his quest to be another Peter the Great. The anti-Western, antidemocratic partnership that China and Russia proclaimed at the Beijing Olympics will look like a map of the 21st century. Authoritarians in Ankara and Tehran and Beijing will understand that history is on their side. The much-abused “rules-based international order”—the idea that might does not make right—will no longer stand for anything, not even hypocrisy.But if Ukraine can push Russia back at least to the February 24 borders, deplete Putin’s military machine, keep Russia sanctioned and isolated, avoid a split in NATO, and retain the support of Western publics, then the idea that human life and freedom have value will be strengthened everywhere. Declining democracies won’t suddenly come off oxygen, but Ukraine will stand as an example for people around the world who refuse to accept a future of brutality and lies.But I won’t pretend that these geopolitical arguments are my main reason for wanting Ukraine to win. Instead it’s Olesya Vynnyk I’m thinking of, Ivan and Nataliia, Lada and her family and pets, Alla and Mark, the cleaning women in orange uniforms. I can’t stand the idea that, after so much loss, they might lose everything. It would be so unfair.This article appears in the October 2022 print edition with the headline “On Democracy’s Front Lines.”",

        "description": "Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  A Labor Day win has the Yankees beginning to get back on the right track. They’ll go for three in a row tonight. When you’ve been slumping like the Yankees have been slumping since the beginning of August, you’ll take any opportunity to celebrate back-to-back wins. That’s what New York accomplished yesterday, outhomering the Twins in a 5-2 win to follow up on their series-salvaging 2-1 victory on Sunday at the Trop. Even the likes of Marwin Gonzalez and Isiah Kiner-Falefa homered! What a pleasant surprise. August is dead and buried, but September’s record is now back to even at 2-2. Onward and upward, please.\nToday on the site, Dan will look back at the last week of minor league play, I’ll check in on Aaron Judge’s home run pace, Madison will run through the Rivalry Roundup, and Esteban will break down everything wrong the defensive mechanics of shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa. Later on, John will consider whether the Yankees need to bring up Ronald Guzmán to fill in for the ever-ailing Anthony Rizzo, Josh will discuss the bullpen’s incoming reinforcements, and Andrés will take the opportunity of Judge’s record chase to remember Roger Maris’ arduous path to No. 61.\nToday’s Matchup\nNew York Yankees vs. Minnesota Twins\nTime: 7:05 p.m. ET\nTV: Amazon Prime Video, Bally Sports North, TBS\nRadio: 1280 WADO, 660/101.9 FM WFAN\nVenue: Yankee Stadium\nFun Questions/Prompts:\n  1. Which player had the more surprising homer yesterday, Marwin or IKF?\n  2. Did you do anything fun on your Labor Day weekend?",

        "description": "Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Braves embark on a lengthy West Coast road trip with hopes of returning to the top of the NL East.  After sweeping the Marlins over the weekend, the Braves enjoyed a day off on Monday before they begin a long road trip out west tonight in Oakland. Atlanta currently is one game back of the Mets (who were rained out on Monday.) Of course, along with plenty headlines for the Braves as a whole, one other fun narrative is Matt Olson returning to Oakland for the first time since being traded to the Braves. \nWhile this return may not grab the headlines like when Freddie Freeman returned to Atlanta, Olson’s return to Oakland is significant due to what he meant to the franchise. While the writing was on the wall for a while that Olson would eventually be traded, he enjoyed the best year of his career in 2021 for the Athletics. Furthermore, by many accounts, Olson was an outstanding individual and teammate as well. One of the more fun things about baseball in recent years is seeing a player return to the home park of his former team. Hopefully it will be a great experience for Olson. \nBraves News\n\nGarrett Spain has a new series over the next few days looking at the first impressions of the Braves 2022 draft class. The position players are the first group Spain dived into. \nThe Braves are one of many potential playoff teams looking to better their position this week before October. \n\nMLB News\n\nBo Bichette had a memorable day in Baltimore as he hit three home runs on Monday. \nAaron Judge is now up to 54 home runs on the season. \nThe Red Sox and Enrique Hernandez agreed to a one-year, $10M dollar extension for 2023. \nJack Flaherty returned to the mound for the Cardinals from the injured list. He has made only three starts this season due to shoulder issues.",

        "description": "Country is seeking an international tribunal but fears its allies are still focused on future relations with RussiaRussia-Ukraine war: latest newsUkraine’s major western allies have yet to sign up to establish a tribunal to try Vladimir Putin and his inner circle for the crime of aggression, wanting to leave space for future relations with Russia, according to Ukraine’s top officials.“It’s big politics. On the one hand, countries publicly condemn the aggression but on the other, they are putting their foot in the closing door on relations with Russia so that it doesn’t close completely,” said Andriy Smyrnov, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, who is leading the country’s effort to establish the international tribunal. “They are attempting to keep some space for diplomatic manoeuvres,” said Smyrnov. “We know that agreements with Russia are not worth the paper they are written on.”His claims come as the US president, Joe Biden, said on Monday that Russia should not be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, something Ukrainian officials and some US politicians had pushed for. Russia had previously said such a designation would mean Washington had crossed the point of no return. Ukrainian officials say that since April, they have been trying to convince their western allies to establish an ad hoc tribunal which would hold Russia’s senior leadership responsible for the crime of aggression for invading Ukraine. Aggression is viewed as the supreme crime under international law because without the transgression of borders during an invasion, subsequent war crimes would not have been committed.

        "description": "On a recent late August day, buses filled with new students and incoming freshman arrived at John Marshall High School in Rochester for a three-day welcoming event — weeks before classes started. Activities included team-building exercises, a tour of the building and learning the school fight song. Even some upperclassmen joined in on the event, including student body president Manasa Yerriboyina.“COVID was hard for a lot of students and teachers because it really took a lot out of us,” she said as she passed out name tags to new students. “To get together brings us closer as a family and it motivates us at the end of the day to do what we&#x27;re here to do: be a family and learn.&quot;John Marshall High School study body president and senior Manasa Yerriboyina welcomes incoming freshmen during a pep rally at the school in Rochester, Minn., on Aug. 23.Elizabeth Nida Obert for MPR NewsCreating an early sense of connection is by design, one aimed at improving the mental health of students who&#x27;ve had a rough few years.The Rochester trend tracks with a statewide study conducted by the University of Minnesota, which found that by the start of the 2021 school year, more than 71 percent of teachers and half the students polled said they were worried about their mental well-being.Events at John Marshall are part of a broader district-wide strategy to limit defiance and disengagement among students in the coming school year — behaviors school officials say emerged in spades after students returned from pandemic-related distance learning. John Marshall High School principal Matt Ruzek welcomes incoming freshmen during a school orientation.Elizabeth Nida Obert for MPR News“I would say it was definitely predictable, but still very surprising,” said John Marshall Principal Matt Ruzek. “I&#x27;m reluctant to say we saw an increase in [bad] behavior, I think what we saw was just a cry for belonging and social connection.”‘Kids just weren’t going to class’School district data shows that while disciplinary infractions were on par with the school year leading up to the pandemic, staff reported more kids engaging in defiant behavior, and more often. A deeper dive into that data shows that students of all ages felt less connected to their schools — and less understood by their teachers.“I think it&#x27;s avoidance behavior,” said Chief of Schools Jacque Peterson, who’s been leading a district-wide effort to help create a sense of community in Rochester’s schools. She said for some students, virtual learning created an environment where they could turn their attention away from learning. When they headed back to in-person learning, some were behind on their learning.“I think it doesn&#x27;t take much to imagine, like, I&#x27;m sitting in a classroom and I have no idea what the teacher is talking about. It&#x27;s easier to just detach than it is to try to figure it out,” she said.John Marshall High School senior Ava Fevold, left, leads incoming freshmen on a school orientation. She pointed out the school office, where they would “have to go if they ever got in trouble,” and encouraged them to take as many Advance Placement classes as possible.  Elizabeth Nida Obert for MPR NewsFor Angi McAndrews, principal of Kellogg Middle School, those behaviors were front and center when kids came back to in-person learning in the spring of 2021. &quot;We had definitely over the last year had more kids that were just refusing to go to class,” she said. &quot;It would be third hour, our hallways should be empty, kids should be learning and we just had kids that just weren&#x27;t going to class.&quot;McAndrews says the behaviors — and their frequency — were baffling and complex, emblematic of the mental health struggles so many kids faced during distance learning. She says COVID mitigation measures made school weird. Some students didn&#x27;t understand expectations after learning online for so long from home. Adding to the challenge: She and her staff hardly knew some of the students after a year of virtual learning.&quot;Trying to build the relationship at the same time as holding kids accountable for behavior is really super challenging, because we want to make sure that kids feel safe and connected and welcome,” she said. “But we also want to make sure that they&#x27;re here and that we&#x27;re there focusing on what we&#x27;re here for, which is education.&quot;John Marshall High School upper classmen greet incoming freshmen on Aug. 23.  “Welcome to JM!” they shouted before a pep rally in the gym and school orientation. Elizabeth Nida Obert for MPR News‘Has anyone asked the kids?’School district administrators were getting an ‘S.O.S’ from school leaders, said Will Ruffin II, Rochester Public School’s equity and engagement director. &quot;We were in a cabinet meeting and then I said something like, ‘Has anyone asked the kids?,” he said.They hadn’t, so they did. Last school year, Ruffin organized nearly 40 listening sessions with students from across grade levels and demographic groups, who had been disciplined, about why they were engaging in inappropriate behavior.

For instance, Rochester students will see more school-based extracurriculars. A new cell phone policy sets clearer expectations around when they can be used in school. But as the fall approaches, Peterson said the focus is on building relationships so it’s easier for students to follow rules, and easier for staff to discipline them when they don&#x27;t. &quot;Until kids feel a sense of belonging, you&#x27;re not going to really see an impact on student achievement or really behavior,” she said. ",

        "description": "Among the stars being questioned under oath for Dominion Voting Systems&#x27; defamation suit against Fox News are Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Maria Bartiromo. Banners bearing their images hang from Fox Corp headquarters in New York City, first, second and fourth from left, respectively.Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty ImagesThe November 2020 email from an anguished Fox News news producer to colleagues sent up a flare amid a fusillade of false claims. The producer warned: Fox cannot let host Jeanine Pirro back on the air. She is pulling conspiracy theories from dark corners of the Web to justify then-President Donald Trump&#x27;s lies that the election had been stolen from him. The existence of the email, confirmed by two people with direct knowledge of it, is first publicly disclosed by NPR in this story. Fox News declined comment.Pirro was far from alone in broadcasting such false claims. In the weeks that followed Election Day 2020, other prominent Fox stars, commentators and their guests heavily promoted them. A repeat target was Dominion Voting Systems, the election machine and technology company. Trump and his allies alleged on Fox that Dominion was engaged in a conscious effort to throw the 2020 race to Joe Biden. They implied and falsely asserted on Fox programs that Dominion&#x27;s machines and software either discarded Trump&#x27;s votes or transferred them to Biden. Dominion argues their false claims were frequently egged on by Fox&#x27;s own stars.  The producer&#x27;s email is among the voluminous correspondence acquired by Dominion&#x27;s attorneys as part of its discovery of evidence in a $1.6 billion defamation suit it filed against Fox News and its parent company. Dominion alleges it has been &quot;irreparably harmed&quot; by the lies, conspiracy theories and wild claims of election fraud that aired on Fox. Pirro&#x27;s role remains under sharp scrutiny. She attended Trump&#x27;s belligerent address from the White House late on Election Night 2020 and advanced his arguments on the air. On Nov. 14, 2020, for example, the day that Biden clinched his victory, Pirro questioned why vote counts shifted against Trump over the course of Election Night in such states as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. (Some counties were counted later than others; ballots cast the same day were often tallied before those cast by mail.) &quot;The Dominion Software System has been tagged as one allegedly capable of flipping votes,&quot; Pirro told viewers, as she promoted Trump campaign attorney Sidney Powell&#x27;s &quot;findings&quot; on Dominion. (A federal judge in Michigan later officially sanctioned Powell for her actions in court on Trump&#x27;s behalf after the elections, while the Texas state law bar is seeking to have her formally punished.)Dominion and Fox News&#x27; lawyers have clashed in recent days, as court records reflect the voting systems company seeks to convince the court to compel Pirro to testify over private texts that, it argues, are relevant to its defamation case. As high-powered stars testify, high stakes come into focus As the summer has unfolded, Fox&#x27;s star TV news hosts such as Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity have been grilled under oath. High-powered attorneys are bearing down on the Murdochs, the most powerful family in English-language media. And it&#x27;s all part of an all-out legal war. Dominion is seeking to strip away the curtain protecting what happens behind the scenes at the nation&#x27;s most watched cable news channel, which holds a singular role on the American political scene. The suit could also define what&#x27;s fair game in journalism and politics in a democracy very much on the edge. The trial date is set for April of next year.The fraud allegations, made without any tangible evidence, were repudiated by state and local elections officials, Republicans as well as Democrats, as well as Trump&#x27;s own attorney general and cyber security chief. In more than 60 substantive court rulings, Trump&#x27;s assertions were found to be groundless, with one limited exception. Fox News argues that it was covering inherently newsworthy claims by inherently newsworthy figures – including the nation&#x27;s top elected official. It also points to segments where its reporters and news anchors cast cold water on the allegations.Fox executives publicly say they will prevail &quot;Freedom of the press is foundational to our democracy and must be protected,&quot; a senior spokeswoman for Fox News said in a statement to NPR. She called the damages claims &quot;outrageous, unsupported and not rooted in sound financial analysis, serving as nothing more than a flagrant attempt to deter our journalists from doing their jobs.&quot;&quot;All you&#x27;re reporting to the public is that somebody — in this case, the president of the United States — has made the allegation of voter fraud by Dominion,&quot; Dan Webb, Fox News&#x27; outside attorney on the case, tells NPR. &quot;I don&#x27;t know how anything could be more newsworthy than the president of the United States making the allegation, and his lawyers making the allegations in court, because that&#x27;s so fundamental.&quot; Dominion ties the rhetoric about the company on Fox to harassment targeting its employees, &quot;from software engineers to its founder and chief executive officer.&quot; Several received death threats. In its legal filings, the company says it suffered &quot;enormous and irreparable economic harm.&quot; Dominion says it projects losing profits of more than $600 million over the next eight years. As examples, it cites instances in which lawmakers in numerous states are demanding a review of existing contracts with Dominion; the cancellation of a $10 million contract in Stark County, Ohio; and Louisiana&#x27;s recent cancellation of a process that prevents Dominion from securing a $100 million contract in that state. Besides Carlson and Hannity, the list of Fox figures already questioned under oath in the cases includes former stars (Shepard Smith) and fallen stars (Lou Dobbs and Ed Henry), as well as show producers and programming executives, court records show. Dobbs left the network in early 2021, the day after Smartmatic, the electronic voting company, filed a closely related $2.7 billion defamation suit against Fox over similarly false claims about that firm made on Fox&#x27;s airwaves.In conducting the first interview of Trump after the election, Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo told Trump and her viewers, &quot;This is disgusting, and we cannot allow America&#x27;s election to be corrupted.&quot; In mid-December, Bartiromo announced that &quot;an intel source&quot; told her that Trump had won the election. She never followed up with any further material to substantiate that reporting. She is due to be deposed under oath on Thursday. Asked by NPR whether Fox still considers Bartiromo a news anchor, and thus part of Fox&#x27;s news and reporting division, rather than its opinion side, a network spokeswoman declined to comment. It is the first known time Fox has not identified Bartiromo as a news-side journalist. Dominion ‘exploring’ whether Fox staffers knew statements were falseIn December 2020, while still a Fox Business host, Dobbs said opponents of President Trump throughout the government had committed &quot;treason,&quot; and later suggested that any Republican who upheld President-elect Joe Biden&#x27;s victory in the Electoral College may be &quot;criminal.&quot;The wide nets cast by Dominion in seeking depositions suggests, University of Georgia media law professor Jonathan Peters says, that the company&#x27;s attorneys are &quot;exploring the extent to which Fox personnel published false statements with knowledge of their falsity or with a &#x27;high degree of awareness of their probable falsity,&#x27; (the relevant fault standards).&quot;&quot;This usually takes into account such factors as what the personnel knew at the time they published, whether the sources were reliable, whether the defendant ignored clear signs that the statements were wrong, whether the defendant investigated the facts, and what motives shaped the statements,&quot; Peters writes in an email to NPR.That assessment suggests that material uncovered by Dominion such as the producer&#x27;s warning about Pirro could provide fuel for the voting machine company&#x27;s case. While Pirro&#x27;s weekend show did not air on Nov. 7, 2020, just after the elections, she returned to the air repeatedly. In January, Pirro was elevated to become a full host of The Five, Fox&#x27;s popular weekday evening political chat show. Dominion seeks links to Fox News executives and the MurdochsDominion has technically filed two cases — one against Fox News and the other against Fox Corp, its corporate parent. The second Dominion suit is bearing down on Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, who together run the family&#x27;s vast media holdings, which include the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, and other newspapers and television properties in Australia and the United Kingdom.Reporters for Fox and the Wall Street Journal repeatedly knocked down spurious allegations of voter fraud, demonstrating that such facts were known within the Murdoch media empire.Together, the twin suits could theoretically reach multiple billions of dollars, with punitive damages along with financial damages. And of course, the cases carry great significance for the nation more broadly, as it captures the incendiary period between the heated claims of fraud about the November 2020 presidential elections and the ensuing bloody siege of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters two months later.Defamation cases are generally hard to win in the U.S. and Peters says this one is no slam dunk. But given what&#x27;s already known, he says, he&#x27;d rather be on Dominion&#x27;s legal team than Fox&#x27;s.Dominion&#x27;s attorneys have obtained emails, texts, WhatsApp messages and more, documenting how the network&#x27;s executives and journalists behaved and acted behind the scenes, as well as determining what they actually knew about the claims, according to three people with knowledge of the litigation. Witnesses have been pressed about the degree to which the Murdochs and Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott were involved in making editorial decisions or kept in the loop.Such decisions can be crucial: Fox&#x27;s projection on Election night 2020 that Biden would win Arizona, first of any major media outlet, conferred great credibility on the Democratic nominee&#x27;s imminent victory. It also enraged Trump and his advisers, who unsuccessfully pressured the Murdochs to reverse the Fox decision desk&#x27;s projection, according to three people with direct knowledge. The public call additionally alienated Trump&#x27;s fans - many of whom were Fox&#x27;s core viewers. For a time, they abandoned the network. The much smaller rival right-wing network Newsmax zoomed up from nowhere in the ratings. In the weeks that followed, key network stars&#x27; embrace and validation of the Trump camp&#x27;s lies about the existence of election fraud contradicted some of their Fox colleagues&#x27; reporting that disproved it. Top leadership passively acquiesced in the star hosts&#x27; rhetoric, and took no meaningful steps to stop it, according to seven journalists there. And the audience started to return. Asked for comment by NPR, a Fox News spokesperson strongly denied this was the case. She emphasized that the talent involved &quot;were covering the most newsworthy story of that period — the president of the United States claiming election fraud.&quot;Fox: Nothing more newsworthy than a president&#x27;s allegations of election fraud The network&#x27;s spokesperson has also pointed to periodic segments, mostly from its news reporters and hosts, challenging or even contradicting such claims from Trump allies. The network and its parent company appear to be girding for a full court trial. In June, Fox hired Webb, who is the co-executive chairman of the powerhouse Chicago-based law firm, Winston &amp; Strawn. &quot;This case is a relatively simple case,&quot; Webb tells NPR in an interview.   &quot;The question there is whether or not Fox correctly reported the allegation [of election fraud], and they did,&quot; Webb adds. &quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any question that Fox accurately reported an incredibly newsworthy allegation made by the president himself.&quot;Dominion wants Fox to apologize, but that risks offending Trump&#x27;s fans A comprehensive settlement, which outside legal observers initially suggested would be a possible outcome of the cases, does not currently appear likely, according to several people with knowledge of the litigation.In theory, it would almost certainly require a payment by Fox of hundreds of millions dollars and an expansive apology — the latter being something that Fox News and Rupert Murdoch have, historically, been loath to do. In 2020, Fox News reached a confidential, multi-million dollar settlement with the family of the late Seth Rich, who was baselessly accused on Fox of having leaked thousands of emails from the Democratic National Committee before his killing in 2016. Such claims were groundless. Fox retracted in 2017 a story making that claim after a week, but never offered a public apology. The network&#x27;s chief media critic covered the settlement in a minute-long segment on his Sunday show. Murdoch expressed public contrition after it was revealed that people working on behalf of his British tabloid, News of the World, had hacked into the voice mails of a murdered schoolgirl - among hundreds of others of people. At the time, Murdoch was trying to salvage a $14 billion deal to take full control of a major British satellite television company. The deal was ultimately scuttled by U.K. regulators. Election lies fueled the deadly Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. CapitolMany observers have tied the lies about election fraud to the overheated rhetoric that fueled the siege of the U.S. Capitol building on January 6, 2021, an effort to block the certification of Biden&#x27;s victory. Lachlan Murdoch has sued the Australian political news site Crikey over drawing just that connection to Fox and the Murdochs. Press freedoms in that country are not as robust as they are here; defamation claims have historically proven far easier to prove there. Crikey&#x27;s top editor says he welcomes the suit as a way to test Australia&#x27;s defamation laws.Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull argues that Rupert Murdoch, through Fox News, has done more to undermine American democracy than any other individual alive today. &quot;The biggest challenge to the United States is not Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin. It&#x27;s the animosity, the division, the anti-democratic movements within the United States itself,&quot; Turnbull told NPR&#x27;s Ari Shapiro on All Things Considered. &quot;Fox News is not the only source of this madness, but it is by far the single most influential one.&quot;In reply, Fox Corp spokesman Brian Nick points to Fox News&#x27;s dominant ratings among cable news channels, and the network&#x27;s strong appeal to Democrats and independent voters, as well as Republicans.

        "description": "Authorities identified Damien Sanderson, left, and Myles Sanderson, as suspects in a series of stabbings in two communities in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan that left multiple people dead and others wounded.Royal Canadian Mounted Police via APOne of the two suspects connected to a series of stabbings in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan has been found dead, authorities said Monday. The search for the other suspect is ongoing, police said. The mass stabbing that occurred on Sunday morning left 10 people dead and 18 injured, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Authorities said that Damien Sanderson was found with fatal wounds, and that his injuries do not appear to be self-inflicted. RCMP&#x27;s Rhonda Blackmore told reporters it&#x27;s possible Sanderson may have been injured by the second suspect in the stabbing attack, Sanderson&#x27;s brother Myles Sanderson. Myles may also have injuries, Blackmore said, but is considered &quot;armed and dangerous. The 30-year-old has an extensive criminal record involving persons and property crimes, authorities said. The stabbings took place across 13 locations in the James Smith Cree Nation and in the village of Weldon, northeast of Saskatoon. The number of injured has grown since SundayThe number of people with reported injuries rose to 18 on Monday, police said in an update. The day prior, 15 people were sent to hospitals and additional people could have transported themselves to hospitals, Blackmore said.&quot;It is horrific what has occurred in our province today,&quot; she added. Police first received a call of a stabbing at the James Smith Cree Nation at 5:40 a.m. Police received more calls reporting more stabbings in the following minutes. Warrants had been issued for the arrests of both suspects, said the Saskatchewan RCMP.Investigators examine the crime scene near a memorial of flowers in Weldon, Saskatchewan, on Monday.Robert Bumsted/APMyles Sanderson has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder, and one count of breaking and entering a residence. Before his death was confirmed by police, Damien Sanderson had been charged with one count of first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder, and one count of breaking and entering a residence.A massive manhunt remains underwayThe brothers were believed to have been traveling in a black Nissan Rogue SUV, license plate no. 119 MPI, but could have switched vehicles. The last sighting of the vehicle was in Regina, the provincial capital, at 11:45 a.m.Police believe some of the victims were targeted by the suspects, and that others were attacked at random. On Sunday evening, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the attacks &quot;horrific and heartbreaking. I&#x27;m thinking of those who have lost a loved one and of those who were injured,&quot; he said on Twitter. He said federal authorities were monitoring the situation. Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "The battle between presidents current and former took center stage again on Labor Day as former President Trump notched a key legal win against the Department of Justice and President Biden sought to separate the reasonable Republicans from the unreasonable ones during his holiday travels.\n\n\n\nA federal judge on Monday granted Trump’s request to appoint a special master to review materials that were seized by the FBI during its search of his Mar-a-Lago residence on Aug. 8. In the process, District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, blocked prosecutors from continuing to review the seized documents until the special master completes their review (The Hill).&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Court is mindful that restraints on criminal prosecutions are disfavored, but finds that these unprecedented circumstances call for a brief pause to allow for neutral, third-party review to ensure a just process with adequate safeguards,” Cannon wrote in her 24-page order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCannon asked the Justice Department and Trump’s attorneys to submit a joint filing by Friday that includes a proposed special master candidate list. In the interim, she added that the documents will not be returned to the former president.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Department of Justice spokesman said that it was reviewing the decision but did not indicate if it might appeal the decision.\n\n\n\nCannon added in her ruling that the special master appointment “shall not impede” the intelligence community’s review of the records that is attempting to determine whether Trump’s possession of top-secret items was harmful to national security (Politico). However, her decision also means that Trump’s lawyers will also be able to review what the special master will see. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe also shed new light on the search, writing in the order that included in the records and documents seized by the government were some of Trump’s “medical documents, correspondence related to taxes, and accounting information” (The New York Times).\n\n\n\nTrump’s legal team did not comment on the decision.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe news came two days after the former president held his first campaign rally since the Mar-a-Lago search, which included an extended screed against the Justice Department and the ongoing investigation into his actions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Biden on Monday used Labor Day to campaign for Democratic candidates in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, two important swing states, while backing unions that helped get him elected, hailing strides since 2021 on his watch and warning audiences that extremist Republicans are putting America’s future at risk.\n\n\n\nThe president returned late Monday to Pennsylvania for the third time in less than a week and just two days after Trump staged his own rally in the state. Just outside Pittsburgh in a county he won in 2020 by more than 20 points, Biden spoke mostly off the cuff at a union hall.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If I have to be in a foxhole, I want John Fetterman in there with me,” he said of Pennsylvania’s Democratic lieutenant governor who is running against Republican Mehmet Oz for an open Senate seat.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe president, speaking as if he and Trump are combatants atop 2022 ballots, told union workers that “the former defeated president” poses a test for every voter who does not want to journey down “this sliding path of oblivion.”\n\n\n\n“It's clear which way he wants to look. It’s clear which way the new MAGA Republicans are. They're extreme. And democracy is really at stake,” he said. “You can't be a democracy when you support violence when you don't like the outcome of an election. You can't call yourself a democracy when you don't, in fact, count the votes that people legitimately cast and count that as what you are. You can't be a democracy and call yourself one if you continue to do what they're doing.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn Milwaukee at a union event called Laborfest earlier on Monday, the president also took aim at “MAGA Republicans,” referring to Trump’s presidential campaign slogan (The Hill and Politico).\n\n\n\n“Not every Republican is a MAGA Republican,” Biden clarified (Reuters). “Not every Republican embraces that extreme ideology. I know because I’ve been able to work with mainstream Republicans my whole career. But the extreme MAGA Republicans in Congress have chosen to go backwards, full of anger, violence, hate and division.”\n\n\n\nTrump used a fundraising email on Monday to repeat a Saturday broadside against Biden, calling the president “an enemy of the state.” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted on Labor Day that Biden “is the most anti-worker president in modern history,” noting that high inflation had taken a bite out of American wages, income and savings (The Associated Press).\n\n\n\n▪ The Washington Post: In Milwaukee on Monday, Wisconsin Lt.

Truss will be the 15th prime minister to serve during Elizabeth II’s long reign.\n\n\n\nTruss was the choice on Monday of a majority of Conservative Party members who voted for their new party leader. Her challenges ahead: recession risks, energy shortages and rising consumer prices, which she campaigned to resolve (The Associated Press). For instance, she has vowed to deliver tax cuts (Reuters). This afternoon, Truss is expected to make her first speech as leader of a nation of 67 million people (The Associated Press).\n\n\n\n▪ The Guardian unpacks Truss’s victory speech and four things she said and what she may have meant.\n\n\n\n▪ Politico Europe: How Truss won.\n\n\n\n▪ CNN: What’s next for Johnson?

In Ukraine, the government made its boldest claim yet of success on the battlefield in its week-old counteroffensive against Russian forces in the south (Reuters).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency today will report their findings after inspection of the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine, Europe’s largest such facility, currently occupied by Russian forces. The agency plans to brief the U.N. Security Council about its report today (The New York Times). Repeated shelling over the past month damaged all of the plant’s connections to four high-voltage external power lines, forcing it to use a lower-voltage reserve line to power the cooling equipment needed to prevent meltdowns, the Times reported.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, the plant’s working reactor was disconnected from its lower-voltage reserve power line. Energoatom, the state nuclear company, reported the dangerous disruption.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Today, as a result of a fire caused by shelling, the [last working] transmission line was disconnected,” Energoatom said in a statement (Reuters).\n\n\n\nThe IAEA is leaving a two-person team of inspectors at the plant for the foreseeable future, the agency’s chief Rafael Grossi said last Thursday (The Wall Street Journal).\n\n\n\nBiden, asked Monday evening as he returned to the White House if Russia should be designated a state sponsor of terrorism, responded to reporters with a single word: “No.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday warned that the plant is “one step away from a radiation disaster” because of near constant Russian shelling.\n\n\n\n“Today the last power transmission line connecting the plant to the energy system of Ukraine was damaged due to another Russian provocative shelling. Again — this is the second time — due to Russian provocation, the Zaporizhzhia plant is one step away from a radiation disaster,” Zelensky said during a presidential address (The Hill).\n\n\n\n▪ The Associated Press: Russia sanctions 25 more Americans, including Sean Penn, Ben Stiller.\n\n\n\n▪ Reuters: U.S. says Russia is buying artillery ammunition from North Korea.\n\n\n\nChina experienced a 6.8 magnitude earthquake on Monday in which 46 people were reported killed and 16 were missing in the province of Sichuan (CBS News).

No charges are expected (Politico).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES\n\n\n\n➤ CONGRESS&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSenators return to work this afternoon facing a deadline to keep the government funded and a push by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to pass an energy-permitting bill that he demanded as a condition for supporting the Democrats’ recently approved climate, health care and tax law, The Wall Street Journal reports.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocratic lawmakers will turn their immediate attention to confirming more of Biden’s judicial nominees. By the end of the month, Congress must also pass legislation to avoid a government shutdown and reauthorize the Food and Drug Administration’s user-fee agreements for prescription drugs, generic drugs and medical devices, the Journal reports.\n\n\n\nA vote on a bill to codify same-sex marriage, which passed the House in July and has drawn some GOP support in the Senate, remains up in the air. Some senators also want to take up changes to the Electoral Count Act, a bipartisan effort that aims to clarify how presidential election disputes are resolved.\n\n\n\nThe White House also asked Congress for an additional $47.1 billion in emergency funding to combat COVID-19 and the monkeypox virus and to back Ukraine in the war with Russia, as well as spending for natural disasters. Many Republicans have balked at continuing to use emergency funding that adds to the deficit to address the pandemic. A deal to continue to fund the government’s pandemic response fell apart in April.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBetween now and Election Day, senators are scheduled to be back in Washington for four weeks, then gone a week and then tentatively back for two weeks in October, according to the Journal and the Senate’s calendar.\n\n\n\nPolitico: Democrats weigh gay marriage vote in pre-election sprint.\n\n\n\n➤ ADMINISTRATION\n\n\n\nWith distractions during Labor Day weekend, Morning Report recaps personnel changes of note in the West Wing and abroad.\n\n\n\nJohn Podesta — a savvy strategist during the Clinton and Obama administrations, a former White House chief of staff, a campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 White House run against Trump, and a wonk when it comes to climate policy — is back in the West Wing.\n\n\n\nHe’ll join Biden’s team as the senior adviser for clean energy innovation and implementation, overseeing the federal disbursement of new clean energy investments while also expanding the reunion of veterans in the West Wing who first teamed up in the 1990s and have rotated in and out of Democratic politics and governance for decades (Ron Klain, Steve Ricchetti, Bruce Reed, Susan Rice, Gene Sperling and Neera Tanden, to name a few).\n\n\n\nNational climate adviser Gina McCarthy will leave her post Sept. 16, a long-expected move that comes after the passage this summer of a historic climate law (The New York Times). McCarthy deputy Ali Zaidi will succeed her. (Her departure date coincides with a planned White House extravaganza with lawmakers and invited guests to celebrate the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act.)\n\n\n\nOIRA: Biden announced he will nominate environmental law expert Richard Revesz to lead his Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget, an important post that some in his party believe has taken way too long to fill. Republicans competing in midterm contests and on Capitol Hill, as well as state officials, criticize what they assert are overzealous and costly federal regulations under the Biden administration. Revesz, who founded the think tank Institute for Policy Integrity, spent years on some of the Environmental Protection Agency’s advisory panels and was in the running to lead the agency before the job went to Michael Regan (E&amp;E).\n\n\n\nNASA: Artemis I, the unmanned U.S. rocket that is supposed to carry the Orion capsule to the moon, encountered hydrogen leaks and other problems that twice kept it grounded amid criticism that the project is too expensive (Florida Today).

His retirement from government service comes amid Russia’s war in Ukraine as well as U.S.-Russian disputes over detained Americans. His exit had been expected this fall but was accelerated because of a family medical issue (The Associated Press).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPINION\n\n\n\n■ Abortion and Trump are giving Democrats a shot, by Michelle Cottle, editorial board member, The New York Times.&nbsp;https://nyti.ms/3wVmU1F&nbsp;\n\n\n\n■ Can Britain’s conservatives find their way again? by Gerard Baker, editor at large, The Wall Street Journal. https://on.wsj.com/3epAa8C&nbsp;\n\n\n\n■ Why Liz Truss may surprise us, by Sebastian Mallaby, contributing columnist, The Washington Post. https://wapo.st/3RFBYc0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHERE AND WHEN\n\n\n\nThe House will meet at 9 a.m. for a pro forma session and return to work in the Capitol on Sept. 13.\n\n\n\nThe Senate convenes at 3 p.m. and will resume consideration of the nomination of John Lee to be a U.S. Circuit Judge for the 7th Circuit.\n\n\n\nThe president will receive the President’s Daily Brief at 9 a.m. He will lead a meeting of his Cabinet at 1:15 p.m.\n\n\n\nVice President Harris will participate in the Cabinet meeting this afternoon.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House daily press briefing is scheduled at noon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🖥&nbsp; Hill.TV’s “Rising” program features news and interviews at http://thehill.com/hilltv, on YouTube and on Facebook at 10:30 a.m. ET.

The mass shootings, defined as incidents in which four or more people were shot or killed, took place in cities including Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago and Norfolk, Va. The deadliest shooting took place in Saint Paul, Minn., where three people died and two others were injured on Sunday (The Hill).\n\n\n\n➤ PANDEMIC &amp; HEALTH\n\n\n\nThe jobs market kept humming along, according to the August jobs report released on Friday. However, the labor force participation rate remains 1 percentage point below its February 2020 level, representing roughly 1.6 million people. As The Hill’s Sylvan Lane reports, part of that discrepancy could be due to the thousands or millions of Americans who remain on the sidelines due to long COVID-19 symptoms that have left them too sick to work.&nbsp; “We don’t know what proportion of people are having very debilitating symptoms with a lot of certainty,” said Julia Raifman, an assistant professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health.\n\n\n\nChina imposed new COVID-19 lockdowns that impact some 60 million people, daily life and the collective exhaustion of China’s population. The New York Times reported with a closeup view from Chengdu, which entered mandatory stay-at-home orders on Friday. “The longer a lockdown goes, the more problems emerge, and the harder it is to tolerate it,” said Matthew Chen, a white-collar worker in his 30s, who noted that the Chengdu government had not given a timeline for reopening.\n\n\n\nTotal U.S. coronavirus deaths reported as of this morning, according to Johns Hopkins University (trackers all vary slightly): 1,047,563. Current average U.S. COVID-19 daily deaths are 407, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\n➤ CYBER RISKS\n\n\n\nCompanies are increasing their investments in cybersecurity and seeking to hire more cyber professionals due to a rise in cyberattacks over the past year but are having trouble doing so amid a shortage of cyber workers across industries. The Hill’s Ines Kagubare spoke to several security experts and industry leaders in the financial, health care and energy sectors to gauge how those critical industries are seeking to keep their networks secure amid the growing number of cyberattacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE CLOSER\n\n\n\nAnd finally … Beautiful elkhorn coral once dominated the watery blue Caribbean, but just like other vital coral species around the world, it has been so decimated by environmental hazards that it is rarely seen alive these days.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nScientists at the Florida Aquarium say they made a breakthrough to reproduce elkhorn coral using aquarium technology, which they say is a historic step that could help revitalize Caribbean ecosystems and offer land dwellers some extra ocean fortification from the fury of hurricanes (CNN).\n\n\n\n“This is a critical step to preventing elkhorn coral from going extinct,” said Keri O'Neil, the senior scientist that oversees the Tampa aquarium's spawning lab. “As these reefs die, they begin to erode away and we lose that coastal protection as well as all of the habitat that these reefs provide for fish and other species,” she said.\n\n\n\nBravo!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Engaged\n\n\n\nWe want to hear from you!

        "description": "The Senate is set to reconvene Tuesday afternoon after a month-long recess, officially kicking off the home stretch to the November midterm elections.\n\n\n\nThe upper chamber broke for the August recess after Democrats passed their multi-billion dollar climate, taxes and health care bill, which crossed the finish line with the help of Vice President Kamala Harris’ tie-breaking vote. The House later cleared the bill, which President Biden signed into law.\n\n\n\nNow, with two months left until the November midterm elections, the caucus is looking to pass a bill that would protect marriage equality on the federal level, requiring that an individual be considered married if the marriage is validated by the law of the state in which is was performed. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe legislation, titled the Respect for Marriage Act, would also ban state officials from denying full faith and credit to an out-of-state marriage on the basis of sex, race or ethnicity, as well as allowing the attorney general to undertake law enforcement actions, and giving individuals harmed by the measure a private right of action.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the bill calls for the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, the legislation former President Clinton signed into law in 1996 that acknowledged that marriage is “only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife.”\n\n\n\nThe House passed the bill in July in a 267-157 vote, with 47 Republicans joining all Democrats in supporting the measure.\n\n\n\nThe lower chamber cleared the legislation nearly one month after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that protected access to abortion as a constitutional right.\n\n\n\nThe ruling, which was officially released after a draft majority opinion leaked, shook the nation, with Republicans celebrating the reversal of the landmark ruling and Democrats sounding the alarm about the future of women’s rights in the U.S.\n\n\n\nSenate passage of a marriage equality bill was initially thought to be an uphill battle because of widespread GOP opposition, but Democrats saw a glimmer of hope when 47 House Republicans backed the measure.\n\n\n\nDemocrats are now making the marriage equality bill a top priority in the final two-month sprint to Election Day.\n\n\n\n“We will have a vote on marriage equality,” Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters last month when asked what is on the upper chamber’s schedule in September.\n\n\n\nSchumer would not give details on when a vote would take place.\n\n\n\nAsked on Twitter if he is excited for any votes once the Senate reconvenes, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), the chief deputy whip, responded \"Marriage equality.\"\n\n\n\nBut it remains unclear if there are enough Republican votes to push the marriage equality bill over the finish line. Assuming all Democrats are on board, at least 10 Republicans are needed to bypass a legislative filibuster.\n\n\n\nRight now, three are in the “yes” column: Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who sponsored the bill, and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who previously told reporters that he “probably will” vote for the measure.\n\n\n\nBetween eight and 10 Republicans are potential “yes” votes.\n\n\n\nAxios reported last month that a coalition of senators were working on changes to the House-passed bill that would help it clear the upper chamber.\n\n\n\nThe office of Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), another sponsor of the bill, told the outlet that she and Collins were working “to build more support with Republicans” with a particular focus on religious protections.\n\n\n\nThey were specifically looking at implementing “more clarity that the legislation would not take away any religious liberty or conscience protections.”\n\n\n\n“I’m looking at protections for religion,” centrist Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who has voted with Democrats some previous high-profile votes, told reporters in the Capitol last month.\n\n\n\nBut time is running out. \n\n\n\nRepublicans are widely expected to take control of the House in the November midterm elections, which would end Democrats’ full control of Washington and make it significantly more difficult for lawmakers on the left to enact legislation.\n\n\n\nSchumer told reporters last month that the Senate will also focus on confirming judges in September. On Tuesday, the upper chamber is scheduled to hold a cloture vote on Judge John Z. Lee’s nomination to the Seventh Circuit.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the Senate has to pass government funding and reauthorize Food and Drug Administration User Fees before Sept. 30.",

        "description": "Democrats are riding high after a recent spate of special election wins and improving polling results, but the House majority remains firmly up for grabs in November.\n\n\n\nRepublicans need to flip just five seats this year to recapture control of the lower chamber. And while both parties have staked out their respective offensive and defensive opportunities, there are a handful of races that could offer hints about how election night might shake out.\n\n\n\nHere are seven races that could determine which party controls the House.\n\n\n\nNY-19\n\n\n\nDemocrat Pat Ryan’s win in the special election for New York’s 19th District late last month gave the party a shot in the arm heading into the fall campaign season.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Ryan is running for a full term in November in New York’s 18th District, and Republicans have a real shot at capturing the state’s new 19th District. Marc Molinaro, who lost to Ryan in the special election, will be on the ballot once again, only this time he’ll be facing off against Democrat Josh Riley.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe race for the new 19th District is a top priority for both parties. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) this week added Riley to its “Red to Blue” program, while Molinaro is seen as a top recruit for Republicans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Cook Political Report,&nbsp;a nonpartisan handicapper, currently has the race ranked as a toss-up.\n\n\n\nPA-08\n\n\n\nPennsylvania’s 8th District, which includes Wilkes-Barre and President Biden’s hometown of Scranton, leans toward Republicans; former President Trump carried it twice.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.) has managed to pull off tough wins before, and if he can do so again this year in a political environment that’s expected to be difficult for Democrats, it could offer a sign of Democratic strength on election night.\n\n\n\nCartwright is facing Republican Jim Bognet for a second time after narrowly defeating him in 2020. But with Biden’s approval numbers still sagging, Bognet might have a better chance of ousting Cartwright this time. Internal polling from both campaigns suggests the race remains close.\n\n\n\nThe Cook Political Report currently rates the contest as a toss-up.\n\n\n\nOH-01\n\n\n\nRep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) is running for reelection to his Cincinnati-area House seat. But after redistricting redrew the contours of the district, he’s facing one of the toughest challenges of his 25-year career in Congress.\n\n\n\nThe district now leans slightly in Democrats’ favor, and the DCCC has named it one of their top targets. Under the new political lines, Biden would have won Chabot’s district in 2020 by about 9 percentage points.\n\n\n\nThe longtime congressman is set to face Cincinnati City Council member Greg Landsman in November. And while Democrats believe they have a good chance at flipping it in November, if Chabot pulls off a win, it would be seen as an indicator of Republican resilience in otherwise unfavorable territory.\n\n\n\nThe Cook Political Report has put the race in its toss-up column.\n\n\n\nCT-05\n\n\n\nConnecticut isn’t where most political observers would typically look for a competitive House race. But Republicans have grown increasingly optimistic in their chances of ousting Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.) this fall despite her district’s Democratic tilt.\n\n\n\nHer GOP challenger is former state Sen. George Logan. And while Logan’s campaign is lacking in funding, Republican outside groups are actively spending in the race, with the House GOP leadership-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) dropping two new ads in the district this week alone.\n\n\n\nOf course, the district is something of a reach for Republicans. President Biden would have carried it in 2020 by more than 10 points under the new lines. But if Logan can pull off a win, it could be an early signal of a coming red wave.\n\n\n\nThe Cook Political Report rates the race as leaning Democratic.\n\n\n\nVA-02\n\n\n\nRep. Elaine Luria (D-Va.) first flipped this seat in 2018, propelling the blue wave that helped Democrats recapture control of the House that year.\n\n\n\nBut the district is a bit redder under the new congressional lines, increasing the likelihood of a Republican win this year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOf course, Luria has a track record of winning tough elections. But with a national political environment that has worked against Democrats for much of the year, she’s in a more vulnerable spot than ever before.\n\n\n\nIf she pulls off a win, however, it could suggest that Democrats are poised to outperform expectations in districts where Republicans widened their advantage during the redistricting process.\n\n\n\nHer Republican opponent this year is state Sen. Jen Kiggans. The Cook Political Report has the race in its toss-up column.\n\n\n\nMN-02\n\n\n\nAnother 2018 blue wave Democrat, Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.), is facing Republican Tyler Kistner for a second time after eking out a 2-point win two years ago.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCraig has outraised Kistner in the race and redistricting didn’t do much to reshape the partisan makeup of her suburban Minneapolis district. But again, Biden’s approval ratings are still underwater and while things may have improved somewhat for Democrats in recent months, it’s still a tough year for the party.\n\n\n\nBoth parties’ House campaign committees — the DCCC and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) — have put the district among their top electoral priorities for the year, and the major House-focused super PACs have already blocked off ad reservations in the area.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Cook Political Report currently puts the contest in the toss-up column.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWA-08\n\n\n\nRep. Kim Schrier (D-Wash.) flipped this seat in 2018, becoming the first Democrat in 35 years to represent the district on Capitol Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe won a second term in 2020 by less than 4 points. And this year, she’s facing Republican Matt Larkin in a tougher political environment.\n\n\n\nWhile Biden carried the district by a 7-point margin that same year and its partisan lean didn’t change after the redistricting process, the election could portend trouble for Democrats if Schrier ultimately falls to Larkin.\n\n\n\nThe Cook Political Report considers the race to be a toss-up.",

Then in April she was nominated for the Turner prize, commended by a jury “struck by bold new developments” in her recent work as well as for the way she has “for decades […] uncovered stories and histories hidden in plain sight”.In works ranging from The Cost of the English Landscape (1989), which connected romantic visions of the Lake District with references to the slave trade and nuclear power production at Sellafield, to Landscape Trauma (2001), where the geological structures of Northumbrian rock formations are writ large on vast photographic panels, Pollard has, for more than 40 years, reflected the inadequacy of simplistic narratives about England’s landscape and in contrast offered an artistic vision of engagement with the natural world that grasps, above all, its movement and complexity.Ingrid Pollard: Three Drops of Blood is at Thelma Hulbert Gallery, Honiton, until 29 October.

        "description": "James Agee, the best writer ever to review movies for a living, was never better than in his review for The Nation of William Wyler’s The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) — for which, FYI, there will be many spoilers below. The movie concerns three returning servicemen — each struggling in his own way to find his way back into the civilian world — and the people who love them. “At its worst,” Agee writes, “this story is very annoying in its patness, its timidity, its slithering attempts to pretend to face and by that pretense to dodge in the most shameful way possible its own fullest meanings and possibilities.” He goes on in this vein for some time, and sums up his critique thus:\nIn fact, it would be possible, I don’t doubt, to call the whole picture just one long pious piece of deceit and self-deceit, embarrassed by hot flashes of talent, conscience, truthfulness, and dignity. And it is anyhow more than possible, it is unhappily obligatory, to observe that a good deal which might have been very fine, even great, and which is handled mainly by people who could have done, and done perfectly, all the best that could have been developed out of the idea, is here either murdered in its cradle or reduced to manageable good citizenship in the early stages of grade school.\nThus ended his review — or, rather, the first half of his review, for in the next week’s issue he returned to explain why he absolutely loved the movie. And that, friends, is Exhibit A in my case for James Agee as Top Movie Reviewer.\nIn that second half of his review he singles out the photography of Gregg Toland — indeed, though Agee did not know it, The Best Years would be one of Toland’s last films: he died in 1948 at the age of forty-four, and thus the film world lost its greatest cinematographer. “I can&#8217;t remember a more thoroughly satisfying job of photography, in an American movie, since Greed. Aesthetically and in its emotional feeling for people and their surroundings, Toland&#8217;s work in this film makes me think of the photographs of Walker Evans.” (Agee had, famously, collaborated with Evans on Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.)\nLet’s take one scene, a celebrated one, as an example of Toland’s skill — and of Wyler’s imaginative direction. Al Stephenson has a problem: his daughter Peggy is in love with another returning serviceman, Fred Derry; but Fred is married. Al asks Fred to meet him at a restaurant/bar called Butch’s, and he tells Fred not to see Peggy again. Fred is grieved, but he agrees; he’ll call her to cut all ties. As he enters the telephone booth next to the bar, Homer — the third serviceman in this story, a sailor who has lost his hands in a fire on his ship, comes in. (See the story of the actor, Harold Russell.) Butch, the owner, is his uncle, and Homer wants Al to watch him and Butch play a song on the piano — they’ve been practicing, Homer tapping the keys with his hooks and Butch filling in. Al’s mind is elsewhere, but he agrees.\n\nThe above shot appears to be a still from an alternate take, because in the movie Homer plays the melody while Butch provides bassline harmony. And in that scene Al can’t keep his eyes on the piano: he keeps looking back at Fred on the phone. But you can see here the famous Toland depth of field and a real compositional genius: Fred is a tiny figure in the back left, and yet he’s as present and vivid to the viewer as the jolly musicians in the foreground. It’s storytelling by photography, and it’s brilliant. Here’s a good clip.\nThere’s a scene later in the movie when Homer — who has been avoiding his fiancée Wilma because, he believes, she doesn’t understand how hard it would be to live with his disability — invites her to his room in his family’s house to see how helpless he is when he removes his prosthetic harness. (This is the one time we see Homer consciously acknowledging his limitations.) And when, instead of fleeing in horror, Wilma with infinite tenderness buttons up his pajama top, well, I just weep. Anyway, that clears the way for Homer and Wilma: the movie concludes with their wedding. And here the genius of Toland and Wyler comes to our aid again:\n\nForeground right: Homer and Wilma. Background center: Al and his wife Milly, and then, on the left, their daughter Peggy — who only has eyes for the now-divorced Fred, Homer’s best man, foreground left. (Al and Milly, like everyone else, look at the marrying couple.) And, as the scene unfolds, we discover that Fred only has eyes for her. It’s brilliant: the words of the service of Holy Matrimony unfold, and as happy as we are for Homer and Wilma, our attentions and our emotions are divided.\nTeresa Wright plays Peggy, and Agee, in the second half of his review, singled her out for particular praise:\nAlmost without exception, down through such virtually noiseless bit roles as that of the mother of the sailor’s fiancé, this film is so well cast and acted that there was no possible room to speak of all the people I wish I might. I cannot, however, resist speaking, briefly anyhow, of Teresa Wright.… She has always been one of the very few women in movies who really had a face.… She has also always used this translucent face with a delicate and exciting talent as an actress, and with something of a novelist’s perceptiveness behind the talent. And … she has never been around nearly enough. This new performance of hers, entirely lacking in big scenes, tricks, or obstreperousness – one can hardly think of it as acting – seems to me one of the wisest and most beautiful pieces of work I have seen in years. If the picture had none of the hundreds of other things that it has to recommend it, I could watch it a dozen times over for that personality and its mastery alone.\nThe story of how Teresa Wright ran afoul of the studio system, and more particularly of Sam Goldwyn, and lost what could have been an extraordinary career, has been told in several different ways, most of which blame Goldwyn and the system. David Thomson, whose judgment is typically acute, seems to think that her decline was inevitable because she was “not glamorous enough to be a star,” was “relatively plain-faced.” Wright may not have been a classic beauty, but plain is not the word to describe that emotionally &#8220;translucent&#8221; face, and not much in all of movies is lovelier than her expression in the final frames of The Best Years of Our Lives, when Fred declares his love:\n\n•\nAbbas Kiorastami (1940–2016) was an Iranian film director (also a screenwriter, painter, photographer, poet) who made curious films — often seemingly simple, featuring quasi-documentary techniques, but hiding a shrewd complexity. His last film, which he had not quite completed at his death, was 24 Frames, which begins by gently, subtly animating Bruegel’s The Hunters in the Snow and then goes on to animate — always subtly, usually gently, sometimes disturbingly — a series of photographs taken by Kiorastami himself. It’s a kind of extended meditation on the very idea of a frame —  a demarcated space within the confines of which we see, and see differently. See, perhaps, more vividly.\n\n\nBut Frame 24 is rather different. Like several of the others, it features a window. Through that window you see trees waving in the wind of a winter storm; and in addition to the wind and rain pinging the glass, you hear, of all things, Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Love Never Dies.” (Most the movie&#8217;s sounds are natural, though music is occasional.) In the foreground is a desk, at which a young woman is slumped over in sleep. Just above her drowsing head there’s a computer screen, and on that screen we see, in a very slow frame-by-frame advance, the last shot of The Best Years of Our Lives.\n\nGradually the light increases — dawn is coming — and (inch by inch) Peggy raises her gloved hand to embrace Fred, and Fred leans forward to kiss her, and down (inch by inch) goes her hat, and then: THE END.\nThus Abbas Kiorastami makes his last bow. And I find it really quite touching that his final message to us, or a big part of it anyway, is simply this: What could be more wonderful than the movies?",

        "description": "Aaron Judge kept up his bruising pace and hit his major league-leading 54th home run, connecting for the third straight day and sending the New York Yankees over the Minnesota Twins 5-2 on Monday.Judge has homered in five of his last seven games for the AL East leaders. He snapped a 2-2 tie in the sixth inning when he hit a 3-1 slider from Trevor Megill (3-2) into the second deck in left.“It’s getting hard to put into words what he’s doing,” manager Aaron Boone said. “Just a special season he’s in the midst of.”The All-Star slugger reached 54 homers in his 131st game. He is on pace to hit 65 homers, four more than Roger Maris’ AL record in 1961. Judge has continued to play down his pursuit of history.“Just trying to do what I can every single day,” Judge said. “I show up to work, prepared ready to go and do whatever it takes to help our team what it takes to get a win today. Whether it’s moving a guy over, driving a guy in, making a play on defense, that’s what I’m focused on.”Judge reached 54 homers in New York’s 135th game; Maris hit his 54th when he connected off Washington’s Tom Cheney in New York’s 139th game on Sept. 6, 1961.“I’m paying close attention to it. How could you not?” Boone said, adding, “it’d be pretty amazing.”It was the ninth time in his career Judge homered in three straight games and third time this season.Judge also doubled. His latest homer came after Gary Sánchez hit a 473-foot, two-run drive into the left field bleachers off Jameson Taillon in the fifth that tied it at 2.Judge ended the game 18 homers ahead of Philadelphia’s Kyle Schwarber for the major league lead. He is 23 ahead of Houston’s Yordan Alvarez in the AL.“Right now, especially the season he’s having, he’s always been a very good player, better than that even,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “This season he’s been as good of a player as any us of have seen in a long time.”Sánchez tied the game by hitting for his 14th homer since the Yankees traded him along with Gio Urshela to Minnesota for Josh Donaldson, Isiah Kiner-Falefa and Ben Rortvedt on March 13.After connecting, Sánchez watched the ball soar into the stands, dropped his bat and ran around the bases as some of his teammates pounded on the dugout rail.Marwin Gonzalez also homered for the Yankees, ending a 0-for-29 skid with his first hit since July 6. Kiner-Falefa added his second homer this year in the seventh.“It’s hard for me to just hit one,” Kiner-Falefa said of Judge. “For him to do what he’s been doing but still have base hits and contribute in other ways with walks, especially when guys don’t want to pitch to him, I think that’s what makes it so impressive.”Greg Weissert (2-0) pitched 1 1/3 innings.Clay Holmes pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his 19th save.Judge scored in the first when he doubled and scored on Donaldson’s single off the base of the left field wall. Judge scored just before Donaldson was tagged out at second after appearing to think he had homered.New York went up 2-0 when Gonzalez hit a slider into the right field seats in the third.For startersTaillon allowed two runs and six hits in five innings. Three of those came in the fifth inning and he was aided by rookie RF Oswaldo Cabrera’s fourth career outfield assist when Miranda was thrown out trying to stretch his single in the fifth.Taillon pitched for the first time since exiting in the second inning Tuesday against the Angels when he took a comebacker off the forearm.Minnesota’s Chris Archer allowed two runs and four hits in five innings and is winless in his last 10 starts.Trainer’s roomTwins: RF Max Kepler (hip tightness) was a late scratch. He struck out as a pinch-hitter in the ninth. …RHP Sonny Gray (right hamstring tightness) will throw his bullpen session Tuesday and his next start is being pushed back to Thursday’s series finale in New YorkYankees: DH Giancarlo Stanton was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the eighth after fouling a ball off his left foot in the sixth. Stanton grimaced and was unable to put any weight on his left foot.

N.C. (WGHP) — A North Carolina school apologized after baptizing more than 100 children without their parent's permission, according to the Fayetteville Observer. \n\n\n\nNorthwood Temple Academy, a private Christian school in Fayetteville, posted on Facebook on Thursday, \"I feel it in my bones, You're about to move! Today we had over 100 middle and high school students spontaneously declare their faith and get baptized today. We will have more pictures of these powerful moments posted over the next couple of days!\"\n\n\n\nThat morning, three students had their scheduled baptisms at the school as part of Spiritual Emphasis Week. The offer was then extended to other students who had not been scheduled. More than 100 students in total were baptized. \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTurkey prices could hit new records this Thanksgiving\t\n\n\n\n\nRenee McLamb, the head of the school, sent families a letter to explain.\n\n\n\n\"The Spirit of the Lord moved and the invitation to accept the Lord and be baptized was given and the students just began to respond to the presence of the Lord,\" McLamb said in the letter, which was obtained by the Observer.\n\n\n\nThe school says it typically notifies and invites parents to be present for any baptisms that happen on campus, and \"it was not the intention of any faculty member to do anything behind a parent’s back or in any kind of secret way.\"\n\n\n\n\"I do understand that parents would desire to be a part of something so wonderful happening in the lives of their children, and so I apologize that we did not take that into consideration in that moment,\" McLamb said. \"I pray that at the end of the day we will all rejoice because God truly did a work in the lives of our students.\"\n\n\n\nMcLamb told the paper that the school should have given students a chance to contact parents and ask permission. “We were not expecting such an overwhelming response to the message that was spoken, but as a mother I certainly can empathize with why some parents were upset,” she said. \n\n\n\nMcLamb said that most of the parents that contacted her were glad, but some were unhappy with the move. Some of the children had already been baptized, and at least one family was concerned that a second baptism could undo the first.",

Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her caucus are also staring down a coming wave of outside spending, which could swamp them in TV ads in the critical final weeks of the midterms. And historical precedence is not in their favor.”\n\n\n\n“In all, Republicans need to net only five seats to win the gavel. And while Democrats may be poised to mitigate some losses, Republicans say there’s still little chance the party’s summertime surge can overcome the stacked map.”",

        "description": "At least D.L. Hall’s socks were on point. | Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Orioles are hanging on by a thread, guys. Hello, Camden Chatters. \nThat didn’t go quite as we hoped, now did it? Yesterday was a very painful day of baseball as the Orioles were swept in their doubleheader with the Blue Jays and now sit 4.5 games back of them for the final playoff spot. \nAll hope is not lost. It is waning, for sure, but it is not lost. If the Orioles can bounce back and win the next two games, they’ll be back to 2.5 games out with six more games to play against the Blue Jays. That’s not much, but the Blue Jays also have a tough schedule remaining that includes nine games against the Rays. That’s right. If you haven’t started already, it’s time to start rooting for the Rays. \nIf you missed the details of yesterdays games or if you, for some reason, feel the need to relive the grisly details, you can check out Mark Brown’s recap of game one and Tyler Young’s recap of game two. \nIt didn’t help much in the end, but one thing that was nice to see yesterday was proof that Adley Rutschman has come out of his brief slump. As bad as most things were in yesterday’s games, his at-bats were solid. In the first game, he went 2-for-4 and in the second, he picked up three hits and fell a triple short of the cycle. \nLet’s just hope that his teammates, both pitchers and hitters, can raise their game tonight and tomorrow before it’s too late for the Orioles. And let’s hope that Jordan Lyles feels better soon.\nLinks\nOrioles Infield Prospect Max Wagner On Developing As A Ballplayer In Green Bay - PressBoxCleanse your palate with a Q&amp;A with minor leaguer Max Wagner.\nAkin makes emergency start, Bichette hits three homers and O’s swept in doubleheader - MASN SportsRoch Kubatko has the quotes from Brandon Hyde and Bruce Zimmermann after last night’s loss.\nBichette 3 HRs in 2nd game, Blue Jays sweep DH from Orioles - The Washington PostThe AP recap for yesterday's doubleheader. I wasn't watching when the balk on Gausman happened, but the idea that the umpire went into the game having already decided he'd call a balk is a little much. Come on, Kevin.\nBirthdays and History\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday! You have four Orioles birthday buddies. Donnie Hart celebrates birthday #32 today. Wow, that’s not old at all! Hart played for the Orioles from 2016-2018. Hart came up in mid-July 2016 and was a force out of the bullpen, allowing just one earned run in 22 appearances.\nIn 2017 he wasn’t quite a dominant, and in 2018 he was pretty bad. The Orioles lost him on waivers in spring 2019 but he only ever played in five more big league games. \nAlso born on this date are Derrek Lee (27), Roy Smith (61), and Jim Fridley (b. 1924, d. 2003). They all played in just part of one season with the Orioles, a combined total of 187 games. \nOn this day in 1974, the Orioles swept a doubleheader against Cleveland behind two complete game shutout by Dave McNally and Mike Cuellar. We sure could have used some pitching like that yesterday!\nIn 1995, Cal Ripken played in his 2131st consecutive game to pass Lou Gehrig for the all-time record. Ripken went 2-for-4 with a home run in the 4-2 win. \nIn 1996, Eddie Murray hit his 500th home run at Camden Yards, though the Orioles lost to the Tigers 5-4 in 12 innings. \nIn 2012, the Orioles played one of the most exciting regular season games in Camden Yards history. After the Yankees scored five runs in the top of the 8th to tied the game, the Orioles came back with home runs from Adam Jones, Mark Reynolds, and Chris Davis in the bottom half of the inning. They won the game 10-6 to move back into a tie for first place with the Yankees.",

        "description": "The season really is hitting its stride now\n    \n\n  The long sunny days of summer are now here and the dust has settled from the trade deadline. There is still a long way to go until the end of the regular season in Major League Baseball—but the best teams are now rising to the top and showing themselves.\n \nAll the best MLB betting 2022 sites have made their feelings clear with updated odds. But which teams are looking good for the Fall Classic? There are six teams from each league in the playoffs this season for the first time ever, so the field is probably more open than before. Here’s who we think might still be playing baseball in October (unfortunately not the Marlins).\n \nLos Angeles Dodgers\n \nAlready a long way clear of everyone in the NL West, the Dodgers look set to make it to the postseason yet again. They have only failed to make it to the NLCS once in the last six seasons and bolstered a roster already bulging with talent with Freddie Freeman to keep that success going.\n \nThere might be some worries that this team has not been able to replicate the regular season form into the playoffs in most of those six years though. Just one World Series championship in that time could be seen as a failure of sorts if we were being particularly critical.\n \nNew York Yankees\n \nAnother team that looks like picking up another divisional pennant is the Yanks. In a stacked AL East that could supply the American League with a majority of postseason teams, the Yankees have still been able to keep out in front. The gap is not insurmountable—but the Bronx Bombers know what they are doing at this stage of the season.\n \nAaron Judge has blitzed the opposition when it comes to home runs this season and there has been some excitement over the acquisition of Frankie Montas. The right-hander could make all the difference on the pitching side of the game as the playoffs come around.\n  \n        \n      Could the Yankees be getting ready to celebrate yet another World Series?\n  \n\nNew York Mets\n \nBut how about those Mets? A recent successful series against divisional rivals Atlanta extended New York’s lead at the top of the NL East and it could be them that receive that all-important bye in the first round of the postseason. There is definitely a renewed feeling of optimism and anticipation at Citi Field these days.\n \nMax Scherzer’s arm is doing a hell of a job from the mound and the return of Jacob deGrom could see the Mets dominate the division from here on out. That 1-2 could work even better in the postseason and maybe even set up the intriguing notion of another Subway Series.\n \nHouston Astros\n \nThe Astros are still just about the most reviled team in baseball thanks to the sign stealing scandal. But the introduction of electronic communication on the mound has not stopped Houston from blowing away the rest of the AL West – and looking good for the postseason once again.\n \nYordan Alvarez has filled the hole left by Carlos Correra and has already hit over 30 home runs. That power and the pitching of Justin Verlander are just two examples of the talent on the roster. Houston just gets the job done and will be harder to beat the longer the season goes on.\n \nAtlanta Braves\n \nThe reigning World Series champions started the season slowly and were hit by the Mets dominating their most recent series - but the Braves are still looking impressive on their way back to the postseason. It may have to be through the Wild Card, but that won’t bother Atlanta either.\n \nThere have been a bunch of acquisitions that will only strengthen the Braves and put them in a better position for the latter stages of the season. The Mets might be too good to catch – and the likes of San Diego and Philly are making great strides just behind them – but Atlanta may yet earn another go at the Fall Classic.",

        "description": "Originalism has reached great heights since it first came about in the 1970s as an obscure legal theory. Most current Supreme Court justices use originalism in their legal reasoning. Adherents believe that the Constitution has a fixed meaning and that it should be interpreted as it would’ve been back in the 1700s. Critics have made many compelling arguments against originalism, noting that it lends itself to a selective reading of history and that determining the Founders’ intent is nearly impossible.But even where original intent can be known, the Framers likely did not want their views to control constitutional interpretation. Nothing indicates that the original meaning of the Constitution was to create judicial review or, if it was, that it was meant to create originalist judicial review. In fact, the evidence, including the Ninth Amendment, points to the contrary.Following the original meaning of the Constitution therefore requires abandoning originalism as a method of constitutional interpretation. This, in short, is what I call the incoherence problem.Originalism is primarily about how courts should interpret the Constitution. That leads to an obvious threshold question: How did the Framers intend the courts to do this? Put another way, what was the original meaning of Article III—the section of the Constitution that creates the federal judiciary—in terms of how judicial review should be performed? This important constitutional question should be analyzed under the same approach as is used for all constitutional interpretation.The answer raises significant problems for originalism. Nothing in Article III explicitly authorizes courts to review the constitutionality of laws and executive actions. Article III, Section 2, defines the types of “cases” and “controversies” the federal courts may hear, but it says nothing whatsoever about a power to declare laws or executive acts unconstitutional. Nor is this power inherent in the authority granted to courts by Article III. Even if federal courts could not declare laws unconstitutional, they still could exercise their constitutional authority to decide the cases and controversies that come before them. Federal courts could apply federal law, decide diversity cases, and resolve all of the other matters enumerated in Article III, Section 2 without being allowed to invalidate a statute or executive action on constitutional grounds. No such power existed in English courts. One would think that if the Framers meant for the Constitution to deviate from English law and practice in such a fundamental way, they would have been explicit about it.[David H. Gans: This Court has revealed conservative originalism to be a hollow shell]Nor do the records of the Constitutional Convention reveal an agreed-upon desire to give the Supreme Court the power to strike down laws or executive actions. The crucial point is that judicial review cannot be justified by either the text of the Constitution or the Framers’ intent as expressed at the Constitutional Convention. Alexander Hamilton argued for this power in “Federalist No. 78,” so perhaps it was assumed that judicial review would exist. Some state courts did exercise that power. But this is a flimsy basis for such a consequential authority, which has been central to American constitutional law and government since its creation by Marbury v. Madison in 1803. With no authority for it in the text of the Constitution, and no desire for it recorded at the Constitutional Convention, how can we conclude that the original intent of Article III was to allow the Supreme Court to decide the constitutionality of laws and executive actions?A commitment to originalism, one might argue, requires abandoning judicial review altogether. It is incoherent to seek the original meaning for how the courts should exercise a power when the idea that the original meaning of the Constitution was ever to give them that power remains unsupported.Another, more subtle problem with the originalists’ embrace of judicial review becomes clear after considering one of the main justifications for the theory. Robert Bork, the late judge known as the “father of originalism,” premised it as an answer to the problem of an unelected judiciary in a democratic system. But Bork’s answer is no solution: Originalist judicial review is just as incompatible with majority rule as is non-originalism. Under both approaches, unelected judges rule on the constitutionality of actions by popularly elected officials. Originalists like Bork answer that originalist judicial review is democratic because the people consented to adopt the Constitution, and originalism simply follows what was agreed to by ratification. To begin with, it is factually wrong to say that “the people” consented to the Constitution, because less than 5 percent of the population at the time participated in ratification. No women and no people of color participated, and only a small fraction of white men did. Moreover, not a single person alive today—not even a living person’s grandfather—voted to ratify the Constitution. If originalists consider it undemocratic that our laws are subject to the approval of unelected judges—who at least die or retire someday and whose replacements are appointed by elected officials—how much more undemocratic is it if society is governed by past majorities who cannot be overruled and are never replaced? Nor can the failure to amend the Constitution be seen as evidence of majority consent, because amendment requires approval by a supermajority: two-thirds of both houses of Congress and three-fourths of the states.I very much disagree with the originalist premise that American democracy should be defined as majority rule or that this concept of democracy must be reconciled with judicial review. But originalists like Bork, who start with this definition, must confront the problem that all judicial review, whether originalist or non-originalist, is counter-majoritarian.Assuming that originalists can surmount this problem and somehow make a convincing case that judicial review is justified under the original meaning of the Constitution, they run right into another problem. Even aside from judicial review, the Constitution must still be interpreted by presidents, members of Congress, state legislators, and government officials at all levels. Originalism requires that all of these people ask: What was the original understanding of how the Constitution should be interpreted?[Harry Litman: Originalism, divided]In his 1985 article “The Original Understanding of Original Intent,” the law professor H. Jefferson Powell laid out strong evidence that the Framers of the Constitution never meant their own intent to be controlling. At the Philadelphia Convention, the Framers explicitly indicated that they did not want their specific intentions to control the Constitution’s interpretation. Years later, James Madison maintained that the Philadelphia proceedings “can have no authoritative character” and that the document coming out of it “was nothing more than the draft of a plan, nothing but a dead letter, until life and validity were breathed into it by the voice of the people, speaking through [the state] Conventions” that ratified the Constitution in 1787–90. The delegates also took steps to shield convention records from public view. They met under a rule of secrecy and preserved the records’ confidentiality when they adjourned by depositing the documents with George Washington. The records remained in “confidential limbo” until 1818, when John Quincy Adams organized and published them.Those looking for evidence of original meaning in the Philadelphia debates often use Madison’s notes. These are apparently the most comprehensive of several unofficial reports, yet they covered no more than 10 percent of the proceedings. Madison himself treated his notes as private property because he thought that the proceedings “could never be regarded as the oracular guide in expounding the Constitution.” The late Yale professor Boris Bittker argued that originalists have failed to explain why the Framers’ intent should be reconstructed from a private document that Madison intentionally withheld.If the Framers anticipated that intent would matter in future interpretations, they thought the views of the state ratifying conventions should be considered. As Powell writes: “Only later, during the breakdown of the Republican consensus, did the attention of constitutional interpreters gradually shift from the ‘intention’ of the sovereign states to the personal intentions of individual historical actors.”This poses an impossible task in determining original meaning. So many people, with countless different views, were involved in the state ratifying conventions that to say there was an original understanding is pure fiction. Moreover, the conventions met separately from 1787 to 1790, and though they were open to the public, there were no official reporters. The unofficial reports of the debates, Bittker noted, “are partisan, inaccurate, garbled, and fragmentary.” In 1833, rejecting the possibility of ascertaining a common intent of the Framers from what little is known of the ratification debates, Justice Joseph Story wrote:\r\nOpposite interpretations, and different explanations of different provisions, may well be presumed to have been presented in different bodies, to remove local objections, or to win local favor. And there can be no certainty, either that the different state conventions in ratifying the constitution, gave the same uniform interpretation to its language, or that, even in a single state convention, the same reasoning prevailed with a majority, much less with the whole of the supporters of it.\r\nBittker commented: “If it were true that the ratifiers wanted their intent to control the courts in deciding constitutional issues, they can be justly accused of gross negligence for failing to take even rudimentary steps to preserve their precious thoughts.”Beyond the text of the Constitution, scant surviving documents record the Framers’ intent during the drafting and ratification of the Bill of Rights. The principal version of the House debates was written by an author whom Madison described as “a votary of the bottle,” whose reports “abound in errors; some of them very gross.” No one recorded the debates in the Senate or the state legislatures. Debates leading up to the later amendments are better documented, but there is still much disagreement about the intent of the Fourteenth Amendment.[Adrian Vermeule: Beyond originalism]Strong evidence supports the conclusion that those who wrote the Constitution preferred that their views not be controlling. Many scholars have argued persuasively that in choosing to write the Constitution in general language, the Framers desired that it evolve via interpretation and, as Justice Felix Frankfurter put it, “gather meaning from experience.” Judge Gerard E. Lynch observed that “the framers of particular constitutional provisions consciously intended to leave particular questions of interpretation open for future development by the courts.” This is why Chief Justice John Marshall famously declared that “we must never forget that it is a constitution we are expounding,” a constitution “intended to endure for ages to come.”The Framers believed that individuals possess natural rights and that the purpose of government, as John Locke wrote, was to protect these rights. The Framers did not think it necessary to enumerate these natural rights in the Constitution. Robert N. Clinton, a retired law professor, explains that “the articulation of concepts of natural law rested principally with the judges. As seen through [the Framers’] eyes, the judges of the day were ‘discovering’ the natural law.” The Framers’ view of interpretation was so radically different from that of today as to make it impossible to say that they ever intended the Constitution to be interpreted based on their original understandings.Originalists might answer that I have ignored how originalism has changed over time. The legal philosophy initially focused on the Framers’ intent, and their rejection of originalism would be relevant under that approach. Now, however, most originalists focus on determining the original meaning of a constitutional provision rather than the specific intent of the Framers. Therefore, they would say, my argument about the drafters’ theory of interpretation is misguided and irrelevant.Still, this does not solve the originalists’ incoherence problem. Originalism would be justified under its own terms only if there was a basis for concluding that the original understanding of Article III was for judicial review to follow the original meaning of the Constitution. No support exists for such an assertion.And even when the focus is on discovering original meaning rather than intent, the Framers’ intent is still relevant. There are no words in the text to interpret concerning the power of constitutional judicial review, so original meaning cannot be ascertained based on the Constitution’s language or dictionaries defining it. Contemporaneous practices were mixed; some states had judicial review in their state courts, and others did not. Nor do contemporaneous understandings support the idea that the original meaning of the Constitution was to be controlling in interpreting the document. People were uncertain not only about what the Constitution meant but about what it actually was. “Our constitution,” Representative James Jackson of Georgia said in a speech to the First Congress, “is like a vessel just launched, and lying at the wharf, she is untried, you can hardly discover any one of her properties.”During their early debates, many members of Congress assumed that the Constitution was unfinished and that it was their job to help complete it. They embraced Madison’s remarks from “Federalist No. 37”: “All new laws, though penned with the greatest technical skill … are considered as more or less obscure and equivocal, until their meaning be liquidated and ascertained by a series of particular discussions and adjudications.”In that essay, Madison reminded his readers that the medium through which human beings communicate is necessarily “cloudy.” “No language is so copious as to supply words and phrases for every complex idea.” Regardless of how comprehensive the ideas were, “the definition of them may be rendered inaccurate by the inaccuracy of the terms in which it is delivered.” This inaccuracy would be amplified “according to the complexity and novelty of the objects defined.”The original meaning of the Constitution, if it included judicial review at all, did not embrace originalism as the method for interpreting the document. Originalism then self-destructs; to follow originalism requires abandoning it.This article has been excerpted from Erwin Chemerinsky’s new book, Worse Than Nothing: The Dangerous Fallacy of Originalism.",

        "description": "On a hot D.C. Wednesday in the middle of July, an 11-foot statue honoring Mary McLeod Bethune—carved out of marble extracted from the same Tuscan quarry that Michelangelo used for his David—stood draped in a black cloak in the U.S. Capitol’s National Statuary Hall. A group of distinguished guests had gathered to honor Bethune, the prominent educator and civil-rights activist who founded a college for Black students in Daytona Beach, Florida, and later served as an adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. She is now the first Black American to have a state statue in the hall.The group, which included several members of Florida’s congressional delegation, smiled as cameras flashed. Two of those present, Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Val Demings, are opponents in the race for Rubio’s Senate seat—a race that could secure the Democrats’ control of the Senate. Together, they tugged at the sheet, revealing the white-marble figure clothed in academic regalia, holding a black rose—which, in life, Bethune viewed as a symbol of diversity.One by one, speakers approached a lectern in front of the statue to offer remarks. “I remember as a little girl listening to my mother and my father talk about a Black woman, a woman who looked like us, who started a college,” Demings told those who had gathered in the amphitheater. “As I listened to my parents tell the story, it seemed impossible. But Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune made what seemed impossible possible.”Demings hopes to conjure some of Bethune’s magic. The race has for some time been considered a long shot for the 65-year-old former Orlando police chief; to win she’ll need to make what seems impossible possible in a state where the voter rolls have flipped from a more-than-100,000-voter Democratic advantage in 2020 to a Republican lead of nearly the same size in less than two years. And for months the polls reflected that, showing Demings trailing Rubio; but in recent weeks, a new batch of polls has shown Demings pulling into an effective tie, or even a slight lead.[Read: What Biden owes Black voters]If the race does break her way, the Democrats will have the convergence of two separate story lines to thank. The first is the story of Val Demings herself: a centrist Black woman with a background in law enforcement—just the profile the party has placed its bets on in recent years. It’s no coincidence, after all, that Demings joined then-Senator Kamala Harris and former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who both worked as prosecutors before seeking elected office, on Joe Biden’s shortlist for his running mate two years ago.Political moderates could admire her centrism; people of color could identify with her race; women could identify with her gender. Demings has converted that appeal into a fundraising advantage, pulling in millions more in donations than Rubio so far this cycle, and spending more than twice as much as him on television ads.And if the national Democratic Party’s unpopularity had been weighing on her fortunes, the events of recent weeks may have buoyed them. In early August, Democrats in Congress passed a mammoth bill on climate change, health care, and taxes. Though the Inflation Reduction Act is by nature full of compromises, as my colleague Robinson Meyer notes, it “will touch every sector of the economy, subsidizing massive new investments in renewable and geothermal energy, as well as nuclear power and carbon capture and removal, and encouraging new clean-energy manufacturing industries to develop in the United States.” Demings has contrasted her own legislative record with that of Rubio, who has one of the worst attendance records in the Senate. With Congress showing that it can actually function, voters might be more receptive to that argument.\r\nDemings watches the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment hearings in 2019. (Damon Winter/The New York Times/Redux)\r\nDemings likes to say she’s living the American dream. In 1957, when she was born, her family lived in a three-room shack in Mandarin, Florida—a rural part of Duval County, just south of Jacksonville. Her father worked as a janitor, and her mother was a housekeeper. A year later, they upgraded to a two-bedroom house, but the roof leaked and for several years it lacked working bathrooms.In the sixth grade, Demings helped integrate Loretta Elementary School, which she used to ride past to get to the Black elementary school 15 miles away. Shortly after enrolling, Demings was chosen to serve on the school patrol. She loved it. “You had to have good citizenship and good grades—and I was selected. I had my little orange belt, and I just fell in love,” she told me in July. “It was such an honor to be selected, because it was a big deal.”[Read: Has America given up on the dream of racial integration?]As soon as she was old enough to get a real job, she did: first washing dishes at a retirement home, and later working fast-food gigs. After high school, she went off to Florida State University to study criminology, with an eye toward becoming a lawyer. “My dad used to say, ‘You’re a pretty good talker. You need to make some money talking,’ and he thought being a lawyer was a pretty cool thing,” she said. But scraping her way through college meant she needed a job—not law school—after graduation. “I was broke broke,” she quipped. So she moved back to Jacksonville, where she became a social worker with the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. But she soon grew disillusioned, doubting how much good she’d ever be able to do with so little power.“I had this 10-year-old boy on my caseload,” Demings said. “He started having some problems, exhibiting behavior that made him really a threat to himself.” She went to her supervisor to see if she could get a psychological evaluation for him, but was told it would be roughly three weeks before a referral could be made; the panel that made those decisions met only once a month.Demings was shocked. “This kid would be dead by then,” she recalled telling her boss. So she went around her supervisor to the juvenile judge—waiting outside his chambers until she was able to plead his case. To Demings’s relief, the judge granted an emergency order. She saw it as a small victory in a tough system, until it backfired: Demings was reprimanded by her supervisor for subverting their structure. She felt deflated by the experience, and began to think about what she wanted to do next.In 1983, Demings got word that the Orlando Police Department was recruiting at Edward Waters College, the historically Black college in Jacksonville, and she figured that she would go down to speak with someone. That ultimately led to a 27-year career at the department, where Demings worked her way through its ranks: patrol officer, juvenile-crime detective, community-relations officer, public-information officer, hostage negotiator, then supervisor of the patrol, investigations, and airport units. (Some aspects of her career were less deliberate: She always told herself that she’d never date a fellow officer—then she ended up marrying one.)As a police captain, she developed a reputation as a tough-on-crime enforcer on everything from traffic violations to violent infractions. “The message has to be clear for the violators: There are no deals,” she said in 2005 after a string of dangerous-driving incidents.But that approach, which continued after she was promoted to deputy chief, drew criticism from members of the Black community in the city. She was lambasted after an Orlando Sentinel story examined the department’s overuse of tasers and aggressive traffic stops and she told the paper that her officers were “kicking butt” in the historically Black neighborhood of Parramore. “If that [vehicle or pedestrian] stop results in something greater and leads to drugs or drug paraphernalia, I call that good police work,” she said at the time.Still, by late 2007, her policing record, and a succession of departures, led to her being selected as Orlando’s chief of police. She was the first woman and second Black person—after her husband, Jerry, who left that role in 2002 to become the county’s public-safety director—to lead the department.From the start, she took an aggressive approach to the job. “We will be courteous to law-abiding citizens but relentless in our efforts to disrupt violent criminals who have no respect for the police, citizens or their property,” she wrote in a New Year’s Day Orlando Sentinel op-ed in 2008. Later that year, Jerry won his race for county sheriff, making the duo the first Black husband and wife to serve as sheriff and chief of police in the same county at the same time.Demings often cites the fact that under her leadership, Orlando experienced a 40 percent drop in violent crime. But a string of excessive-force complaints—including a 2010 incident in which an officer broke an 84-year-old man’s neck by flipping him upside down—revealed some of the clear dangers of the aggressive policing tactics that were employed during her tenure. “Apparently it’s perfectly acceptable to break old men’s necks for no reason,” John Kurtz, the founder of the blog Orlando CopWatch, said at the time. Demings initially defended the officer’s actions in the incident, but eventually modified the department’s use of the technique that led to the octogenarian’s fractured vertebrae. In 2011, after 27 years with the department, Demings stepped down and set her sights on a new challenge.Elected office wasn’t something Demings had initially been interested in. But as she was about to retire, Mayor Buddy Dyer called her to let her know that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee thought she would be a good candidate to run for the House seat that represented Orlando. “I just burst out laughing,” she told me. “And the mayor’s like, ‘Chief, are you okay?’” She thought he must have been joking. “You know your police chief. I’m a little rough around the edges,” she recalls telling him. “And I don’t know if I’d make a good politician.” Still, she met with Representative Steve Israel, who was the committee chair at the time—and ultimately decided that running for Congress was a logical next step.She lost her first campaign and suspended another run for mayor two years later. But her defeats only raised her public profile. By 2016, court-ordered redistricting meant that the Tenth District was significantly more Democratic than it had been when she first ran for office—which meant that her biggest hurdle would be her primary opponent. She won 57 percent of the vote in a four-person primary—and received 15,000 more votes than her nearest competitor. She then won in the general election by nearly 100,000 votes.Thirty-three years after Demings had packed everything she owned in the trunk of her Oldsmobile Firenza and headed to Orlando for her new job with the police department, she would be taking her tough-on-crime bona fides to Washington.Across two terms, Demings has sponsored or co-sponsored dozens of bills that have become law—though a divided Congress means she does not have a signature piece of legislation to hang her hat on. But her most significant moment came when, in January 2020, she served as an impeachment manager during the first Senate trial of then-President Donald Trump. Though the Senate ultimately acquitted Trump—voting along party lines except for the sole defection of Senator Mitt Romney—Demings’s prominence continued to grow. She was profiled by The Washington Post, NPR, and other national outlets. “Was it worth it? Every day it has been worth it,” she said of the trial after its conclusion. “Just like when I was a law enforcement officer, when I saw someone breaking the law, I did not stop and think about, well, my goodness, what will the judge do? ... I did my job to stop that threat and then go to court and plead my case.”After that, she landed on Biden’s shortlist for vice president—evidence of both her meteoric rise and the Democratic Party’s relentless search for its next phenom who can capture the national imagination the way Barack Obama did.\r\nDemings makes phone calls to constituents from the Pinellas County Democratic headquarters in Florida. (Octavio Jones / Getty)\r\n“Florida, vota por la jefa de la policía, no por el politiquero,” Demings’s first Spanish-language ad, aired in June, said. Vote for the chief of police, not the politician. Demings is trying to define herself for voters she hopes will form her coalition—particularly the Latino voters who have been tilting Republican in recent years She’s on the defensive: The Rubio campaign has tried to pin the Democratic Party’s most left-wing sensibilities on her.In a campaign ad of his own, Rubio touts his endorsement from Florida’s Fraternal Order of Police and 55 sheriffs, and suggests that Demings supported the “Defund the Police” movement—or, at the very least, did not reject it fiercely enough. “Senator Rubio has not only tried not to defund the police; he’s defended the police,” Al Palacio, the Miami Dade public-schools Fraternal Order of Police president, says in the ad. “And we’re here to defend him.” Rubio’s campaign believes that this is a winning issue; an October 2021 Pew Research Center survey found that 47 percent of Americans want to see more spending on police, compared with 15 percent who would like to see budgets reduced.Demings dismissed the ad out of hand, responding with a brief statement: “I am the police. This is ridiculous.”[Brian Klaas: Focus on who police are, not what they do]Though Florida has not seen the same jumps in crime rates as some other parts of the country over the past two years, the race has focused on policing and crime issues. The irony is, were she running as a Republican, Demings would be seen as emblematic of the tough-on-crime policies some voters say they want.But because she’s running in a state that is turning redder and redder, Demings has to strike the right balance of being the police enforcer she’s always been while appearing open to reform, and being unrelentingly liberal on issues such as access to abortion while emphasizing her Christian faith so as not to isolate Catholic voters. And she has to highlight her identity—her family’s economic status growing up and, perhaps most important, her race—while not making it the central plank of her campaign. Over the past several years, Florida Republicans have passed laws that limit discussions of identity in classrooms and other public spaces—a bit of a contrast with the political campaign Demings has run, explaining to voters how being a Black woman has shaped her life and informed her policy preferences.That’s been a difficult sell: How do you convince voters that you’ll be a senator who can get stuff done if the Democrats can manage to keep their Senate majority, when the Democrats had—at least in the public’s view—gotten so little done? But with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the party’s chances look different now, and maybe, just maybe, Demings will be the beneficiary. If Demings pulls off an upset, it will be not solely because she’s a Black woman, but because the Democrats finally figured out how to rack up some wins in D.C. And what could be a greater crowd-pleaser than that?",

        "description": "This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from The Atlantic, Monday through Friday. Sign up for it here.      Benjamin Spock’s The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care, which was published in 1946 and sold nearly 50 million copies in the author’s lifetime, sparked the formation of the currently enormous industry advising parents of little ones. There’s now no shortage of guidance for raising children through early developmental milestones, from toilet training and getting your kid to sleep through the night to steering them through the turbulence of adolescence. Yet, once children reach adulthood, the instruction abruptly stops—even though, for many families, that period is the longest, and in some ways the most anxious and uncertain, stage of parenthood.[Read: ‘Intensive’ parenting is now the norm in America]It also might be the most overlooked. “There’s a perception that parents need help with little kids because that’s the time when everything is decided,” says Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, a developmental psychologist and senior research scholar at Clark University, who co-wrote Getting to 30: A Parent’s Guide to the 20-Something Years, one of the few advice books I could find for parents of young adults. But Arnett contends that many people actually build the foundation for their adult life during a phase he calls “emerging adulthood,” which occurs from 18 to 29 years old. During this period, parents and children also set new norms in their relationship that continue as the children grow into older adults running their own households and who ultimately may end up caring for their parents, according to Karen Fingerman, a human-development and family-sciences professor at the University of Texas at Austin. And although many factors—such as income and education level—influence how this transition plays out, navigating this changing parent-child dynamic seems to be universally confusing.Legally, parents aren’t obliged to support their children once they turn 18. But the moral responsibility of helping one’s kids doesn’t just go away when they leave the nest, and many parents find themselves still enmeshed in their adult children’s lives, both emotionally and financially. “It’s a difficult kind of anxiety to cope with,” because your instinct is to protect them, but once they’re adults, you lose that control, Arnett told me.Finding the right balance can be tricky. If parents offer too much help, their kids might start to resent the infringement on their independence, but if they offer too little, they might have to watch their children struggle. For example, when Laura Zhang Choi’s daughter decided to not go to college yet, or ever, Choi knew she had to accept that decision—even though she was terrified that it was a mistake. Choi, who lives in Stewartsville, New Jersey, has always worked to make sure that her daughter, who is transgender, feels safe and supported. But while helping her daughter process her identity and whether she should attend college, along with many other elements of the transition to adulthood, Choi has had “no blueprint to follow, and grasped at straws … All the things I thought I knew about parenting, I had to reevaluate.” There’s little out there to guide parents through these dilemmas. But even if there were a Dr. Spock for adult kids, the solutions wouldn’t be as simple as sleep training or time-outs for bad behavior. “No one script is going to work for everybody,” Arnett told me. He’s seen this personally as the father of twins, one of whom craves advice on a daily basis while the other can go months without seeking it.Helping young adults through this period seems to only be getting harder, as the societal forces that encourage dependence mount, while those that lead to independence get pushed back. Educational costs have soared, and college students are grappling with unprecedented debt. According to a Pew Research Center report, among 18-to-29-year-olds who had completed at least a bachelor’s degree, 49 percent hadn’t paid off their loans yet. As a result, some are delaying milestones such as buying a first home or getting a first job, instead continuing to rely on their parents, according to Deborah Carr, a sociology professor and the director of the Center for Innovation in Social Science at Boston University. And this dependence is not just financial. Adults are also marrying later than in earlier generations, meaning that, for many, “parents remain more important for longer as your main emotional touchstone,” Arnett told me.[Read: The unique challenge of raising teenagers right now]Of course, many parents today really do want to stay close with their kids as they grow up—an intimacy that can be complicated for some families. Parents and adult children are “essentially establishing a new relationship with unclear rules and uncertain boundaries,” which “can be a challenge for both generations,” Carr explained to me. According to one 2012 poll conducted by Arnett and a team of researchers at Clark, more than half of young adults said they text, call, email, or see their parents in person every day or nearly every day. For parents, being in constant contact can be hard because “you’re on duty for longer,” Arnett said. But young adults struggle with this too. Thirty percent of poll respondents agreed “that their parents are more involved in their life than they really want them to be.”Financial assistance is another way that many parents try to help as their children grow into adulthood—but that involvement can also be uneasy. According to a 2020 AARP survey, half of middle-aged adults who have children over 25 are still giving them money for everyday needs. Mitchell Kraus, a certified financial planner in Santa Monica, California, says that over the roughly three decades he’s worked in financial planning, he’s seen more and more parents keeping kids on their cellphone and health-insurance plans or even assisting with the down payment on a house. Parents “realize how much harder it is to get started now than it was decades before, when they were starting off,” and try to give their kids every advantage, he told me. Although Kraus doesn’t oppose providing some help, he warned that there are no easy rules to follow and that there’s a fine line between offering support and creating dependence. “Even the best banks make mistakes when loaning money, so with emotions involved, it is even tougher,” Kraus said. Money is actually the top source of conflict in relationships between parents and their adult kids, according to a 2013 Clark poll of parents.  Still, when handled maturely, parents and adult kids can get over even the thorniest financial disagreements. Jackson Pierce, a 28-year-old, confronted this issue when he asked his parents if they would consider cosigning a loan for his graduate program in classical acting and they refused. They supported his career path—even if they worried about its economic security—but they wanted him to understand that he was responsible for his choices about money. “We said, ‘You’re an adult … and you’ve made this decision and you have to live by this decision,’” his mother, Tracey, told me. Pierce accepted this and moved on. “I knew that the answer might be ‘no,’ and I was more than prepared for it,” he told me. Tracey admitted to feeling a “twinge of guilt” at turning him down, but more than anything, she was relieved by how calmly they resolved the issue.  As adults move into their 30s, they usually begin to need less from their parents and conflicts such as these might grow less frequent. But challenges are likely to reemerge as parents age and start to need support from their kids. Fingerman, the UT Austin professor, says the process typically starts with adult children handling smaller tasks, such as caring for a parent who’s had surgery. That escalates to stepping in more often, for example, if health issues intensify or one parent dies. This transition can be stressful for kids, and though they might find some guidance on the physical aspects of caring for parents, almost no advice deals with emotional issues, Fingerman told me. Parents may struggle to accept the aid they need, too. In cases such as those, Fingerman emphasized that adult children should treat their parent like a peer, rather than a child, and should approach discussions collaboratively. But just as parents of young adults cannot control their children’s choices, adult children need to accept that their parents also get to make decisions they don’t agree with, she said.Even with these hurdles to overcome, maintaining a close relationship pays off for both adult kids and their parents. In her research, Fingerman has found that grown children who receive intensive parental support fare better than those who receive less aid. Parents benefit, too, because adult children who got a lot of help are also more likely to provide a higher level of care when their older parents need it. Indeed, the happiness one derives from family grows with age, according to a June 2022 AARP study.  In the end, despite the lack of guidance, many older adults and their parents are able to find healthy ways to stay close and build relationships that work for them. In the best cases, these bonds transcend any simplistic dynamic of a caregiver and a person being cared for, instead embodying a profound reciprocity.",

        "description": "In 1992, Pat Buchanan made a campaign stop at the San Diego–Tijuana border. As a few white-power activists who had tagged along milled in the background, he called for the United States to build a wall—a 200-mile-long physical boundary between the U.S. and Mexico. At the time, Buchanan was seeking the Republican nomination for the presidency, the first of two consecutive efforts that were rebuffed by party voters and leaders alike. Buchanan and his politics seemed to be on the verge of being drummed out of the GOP altogether. (When he made one last try for the White House, in 2000, he ran on the Reform Party ticket.) From the start of the 1990s, his hostility toward free trade and NATO, his extremist proposals on immigration, and his jeremiads against cultural decline marked him as an outlier. Communism was over, the stock market was rising, Silicon Valley was just taking off, and few were interested in Buchanan’s grim vision of a looming “illegal invasion.”Three decades later, Buchanan’s ideas may still seem fringe, but they are no longer marginal. His call for a barrier at the border has become a staple of Republican platforms, as have his denunciations of cultural decadence, his skepticism about free trade, and his warnings about the dangers of the “global elite” and of immigrant incursions. As the midterms approach, Donald Trump’s conspiracy-laced version of those views shows no sign of flaming out, which forces the question: Is this ethno-nationalism and pugnacious stance toward cultural “elites” going to be the signature of the Republican Party from now on? And if so, what happened? Not all that long ago, the GOP was the party of Big Business, free markets, “traditional” family values, and anti-communism. Now it has become the party of election denial and the Wall.When Trump first surfaced as a 2016 presidential candidate, his dizzying ascendance, seemingly out of nowhere, fueled the sense that he was hijacking a GOP theretofore rooted in the confident optimism that had come out of the Reagan era. Historians have considered Ronald Reagan’s presidency, and the adoption by the Democratic Party (especially under Bill Clinton) of Reagan’s end-of-big-government-and-big-labor-and-high-taxes ideology, as the formative development of the last quarter of the 20th century—the vision that laid out the parameters for American politics in the new millennium.Yet the recent trajectory of the Republican Party, and its turn against many of the key precepts of Reaganism, calls for a reassessment of this perspective. That is precisely what the historian Nicole Hemmer offers in Partisans: The Conservative Revolutionaries Who Remade American Politics in the 1990s. She is joined in rethinking the evolution of conservatism by two journalists who approach the subject from different places on the political spectrum. Dana Milbank, the author of The Destructionists: The Twenty-Five-Year Crack-Up of the Republican Party, is a liberal Washington Post columnist. Matthew Continetti, the author of The Right: The Hundred-Year War for American Conservatism, arrived at The Weekly Standard as a 22-year-old in 2003 and is now a Never Trumper at the American Enterprise Institute and a contributing editor to National Review. All three books portray a conservatism that was fraught with tensions long before Trump’s emergence. Their goal is to explain why the current incarnation of the GOP shouldn’t come as a surprise. In showing the deep roots of our present crisis, their analyses also suggest the limits of any politics focused on a dream of salvaging the Republican Party.The consensus among political historians of the post–World War II years is that the conservative movement of the period was driven by two connected concerns: the desire to constrain the welfare state and the labor unions that had been created during the New Deal, and the imperative to fight international communism. In pursuit of both goals, conservatives embraced the ideology of the free market—as articulated, most notably, by Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman—and rejected the isolationism and “America First” mentality that had prevailed among many on the right prior to the war. This was, as Continetti argues, a major political shift: In the 1920s, the American right had been split between open elitists in the intellectual world, such as the journalist H. L. Mencken, who warned in a 1919 essay that “all government … is a conspiracy against the superior man,” and the grassroots mobilization of the Second Ku Klux Klan, which strove through mass rallies and political campaigns to maintain the purity of “the old pioneer stock.”During the 1930s, ’40s, and ’50s, the fight against the New Deal and the Soviet Union gave the right a new energy. Under the broad umbrella of opposing socialism and communism and defending freedom, all kinds of policies that might otherwise have appeared narrowly self-interested—free-market economics, anti-tax measures, opposition to unions, an aggressive interventionism in Vietnam and elsewhere—acquired an idealistic gloss. Even the ugliest aspects of postwar conservatism, such as its opposition to the civil-rights movement, could be portrayed as a principled defense of localism, or even as part of the anti-communist project: Some conservatives suspected that key advisers of Martin Luther King Jr. were secretly in league with Moscow, and that the entire civil-rights movement was riddled with communist sympathizers.But this brand of conservative politics—while garnering substantial support, especially from midsize-business owners and prosperous suburbanites, as well as southerners—failed to gain enough traction to win national elections in the ’50s and ’60s. Victories came only in the ’70s, as postwar economic growth faltered and the conservative coalition expanded. Now it included working-class white voters in the North and South animated by resentment, fear, and racism in the aftermath of civil-rights successes. The movement also tapped into a new wave of organizing among evangelical churches, which were able to make common cause with anti-government conservatives in opposing such policies as the IRS denial of tax-exempt status for Christian schools found to be racially discriminatory. For their part, conservatives signed on to much of the evangelicals’ cultural crusade against abortion access and gay rights.[Read: How the GOP surrendered to extremism]Yet these new recruits and the business-oriented conservative establishment, all three authors argue, never fully merged. The New Right, which gathered momentum in the ’70s, remained at arm’s length from the elite intellectual organizations of conservatism, such as the American Enterprise Institute and the libertarian Cato Institute. Its key activists lacked the establishment’s intense focus on economic issues, and were angry that their own zealous focus on cultural issues (strictly limiting abortion, banning gay teachers from public schools) wasn’t shared. The schism and the fractious extremism at the core of the party, in tone as well as policies, were masked, however, by Reagan’s cheerful persona—that of an avuncular, old-school movie-star gentleman whose politics embraced, Hemmer writes, “flexibility and optimism, making movement conservatism genuinely popular for the first time in the Cold War era.”Not that Reagan, despite the unifying power of his presidency, was a moderate. He had a long history of warning against the “encroaching control” of the liberal state, and his administration’s harsh attacks on welfare policies, unions, and busing were extreme; so was his support for his “Star Wars” defense initiative and for violent anti-communists in Central America. But anti-communist internationalism on the right also helps explain Reagan’s comparatively genial stance on immigration. As he put it during his 1980 campaign, “You don’t build a nine-foot fence along the border between two friendly nations.” An early draft of the speech went further still: “We cannot erect a Berlin Wall across the southern border.”The collapse of the Soviet Union and decline of communism in the early ’90s shook the political world of the right. Suddenly, the lack of common ground between religious and cultural conservatives on the one hand and the libertarian-leaning establishment on the other was exposed. Already, anti-communist hard-liners had denounced Reagan for meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, and evangelicals had been chafing at his failure to do more to outlaw abortion. In the 1988 presidential race, Hemmer reminds us, the television host Pat Robertson had challenged George H. W. Bush in a campaign that tapped into conservative dissatisfaction with Reagan.Despite the apparent triumph of capitalism in the Cold War, many conservatives in the 1980s and early ’90s were gripped by what Continetti calls a “deep-seated pessimism.” They had managed to take control of the White House for eight years, yet were unable to shrink the state, had trouble holding Congress, and felt unwelcome in Hollywood and academia. A gloomy, bitter conservatism began to spread, from above and from below. Its rhetoric was tinged with loss and preoccupied with themes of masculinity, race, and immigration, a far cry from Reagan’s upbeat invocations of freedom and morning in America. The journalist Peter Brimelow’s 1995 best seller, Alien Nation, for example, opened with the suggestion that the country had been defined by a “specific ethnic core” that “has always been white”—and was now in danger of being replaced.[From the March 2018 issue: Boycott the Republican Party]The transformation on the right was stylistic as well as substantive. It’s hard to imagine Reagan leading cheers of “Lock her up!” or inventing Trump-style nicknames for his enemies. But this jeering patois would have been familiar to followers of Rush Limbaugh, whose nationally syndicated conservative talk-radio program started broadcasting on AM stations in 1988. Limbaugh was a college dropout who had read Pat Buchanan’s newspaper columns when he was growing up in Missouri and then found his way to radio, getting his break when Morton Downey Jr. was fired for using openly racist language on the air. Limbaugh immediately began to develop his own style, one that anticipated the bullying sarcasm of Twitter: Rather than harangue his audience or engage in high-minded exegeses of Friedrich Hayek or other conservative thinkers, he set out to “ridicule the left,” as Hemmer puts it. Limbaugh routinely insulted Democratic politicians—Ted Kennedy was “The Swimmer”; Robert Byrd was “Sheets” (referring to his Ku Klux Klan past)—and when critics phoned in to his show, he would cut them off with what he referred to as a “caller abortion” (a loud vacuum-cleaner noise followed by a scream before the line went dead).A similar shift took place on Capitol Hill, where a program of tax cuts and deregulation was supplemented by constant hyperbolic invective. Newt Gingrich’s crusade to rally congressional Republicans to build their base by explicitly embracing political language that demeaned their political opponents is well known. Even so, the intensity of some of this rhetoric—and the ways in which it foreshadowed the style on the right today—remains surprising. Milbank describes the 1990 memo that Gingrich’s political-action committee circulated to Republican candidates. Titled “Language: A Key Mechanism of Control,” it instructed them in how to “speak like Newt,” using words such as sick, corrupt, bizarre, pathetic, destroy, and decay when characterizing Democrats. Gingrich himself deployed this strategy incessantly, describing Democratic politicians as the “enemy of normal Americans” and calling for a “war” against the left to be fought with “a scale and a duration and a savagery that is only true of civil wars.”Meanwhile, conspiracy theories acquired new salience in the movement, having long proliferated in less public ways on the right. (The John Birch Society, for example, specialized in anti-communist paranoia and continued to attract members well after it was repudiated by William F. Buckley and National Review in the 1960s.) Stoking doubts about whether Vince Foster, who had been deputy White House counsel to President Clinton, had really died by suicide in 1993 proved popular. Helen Chenoweth, the three-term Idaho representative in the ’90s, catered to militia supporters and the far right with claims that the United Nations was secretly plotting to institute a “one world” government, a mission enabled by federal agents in “black helicopters” flying over Idaho.Hemmer and Continetti make the case that the Republican establishment still held sway as late as the George W. Bush years. Hemmer calls Bush “the last Reaganite,” intent on pursuing free-trade agreements and tax cuts, while Continetti describes Bush as adopting a principled “freedom agenda” in the War on Terror and notes his efforts at immigration reform. Milbank, by contrast, sees the entire Republican establishment lurching to the right over those same Bush years. In his account, gerrymandering, campaign-finance scandals, and the “Brooks Brothers Riot” in Florida after the 2000 election (in which Republican operatives in suits mobbed the office where a recount was taking place, shouting “Stop the count! Stop the fraud!”) all anticipate the naked power grabs of the contemporary right. Milbank himself became the target of Karl Rove’s rage after writing a 2002 article headlined “For Bush, Facts Are Malleable,” about the administration’s efforts to stoke support for the Iraq War; after it appeared, Rove telephoned Milbank’s boss and requested that he be removed from the White House beat.As the authors get closer to the present and to Trump-era chaos, the reading experience becomes disorienting. One source of overwrought, outlandish outrage is rapidly overtaken by the next; any given departure from evidence-based rational assessment is topped by another, as denial of Barack Obama’s American citizenship is joined by climate-change denial, COVID denial, and 2020 election denial, while the base declares faith in QAnon and ivermectin. Each dispiriting set of characters gives way to a yet more demoralizing array. Glenn Beck is followed by Tucker Carlson; Ann Coulter and Sarah Palin by Elise Stefanik; the Tea Party by the Oath Keepers. One moment Lou Dobbs is insisting that he’s “just asking questions” about Obama’s birth certificate; the next, he’s been thrown aside for being insufficiently anti-immigrant. Revolutions “devour their own children,” goes the truism (credited to a skeptic of the French Revolution)—but among conservatives today, the journey from hero to apostate seems to happen at warp speed. So, among almost all the Republicans in the legislative branch, did the journey from momentarily denouncing Trump, on January 6, to swearing fealty once again.Will the Republican Party continue to move ever further to the right? And if so, what does this portend for American politics? Taking the longest view, Continetti sees the current struggles on the right as the latest manifestation of a 100-year battle between the “forces of extremism” and those who have sought mainstream acceptance for conservative ideas—the establishment wing to which he has devoted his life. One imagines that he is looking for models when he approvingly refers to Senator Margaret Chase Smith’s 1950 castigation of Joseph McCarthy, and her warning that “certain elements of the Republican Party” had chosen to manipulate their way to “victory through the selfish political exploitation of fear, bigotry, ignorance, and intolerance.”But reading these books together does not inspire confidence. For one thing, as Continetti is honest enough to admit, the distinctions between the extremists and the respectable right have never been all that clear-cut. The postwar conservative movement was entwined with opposition to the civil-rights movement from the outset. Such luminaries as Buckley used National Review in its early days to argue against federal troops going to Little Rock, Arkansas, to protect Black schoolchildren; he did so on the grounds not only that the “Southern dilemma” was a matter for local control but that white people remained the “advanced race” and thus should be able to discriminate. Given this history, which predates the 1990s by decades, resurrecting an American conservatism free of the taint of racism—and deeply committed to democratic political engagement—is a formidable challenge.Nor is it so easy to absolve “classical liberalism” and Reagan’s free-market policies of responsibility for our current travails. What you won’t find in these accounts, focusing as they do on the ideas and programs of conservatives in positions of power in politics and the media, is much sense of the social history of the United States over the past three decades, as the legacies of the Reagan years became clear. The radical tax cuts, hostility toward labor, and deregulation that marked the 1980s facilitated the rapid deindustrialization of American cities and the rise of finance and services as the motors of economic life in the United States. The unionized jobs that had provided meaningful upward mobility for many in the postwar years all but disappeared.Reagan promoted these shifts, even if they did not originate with him. And as Clinton’s presidency went on to demonstrate, the laissez-faire economic agenda of the 1980s and ’90s became a largely bipartisan one: It promised a vision of a newly dynamic, globally plugged-in America rescued from boom-and-bust economics by low tax rates and the light hand of regulation. Pursued with a blithe insistence that all would be better in this best of all possible worlds, that agenda helped seed the social chaos and despair that have been such fertile ground for the right.It has also helped create an economic elite with little connection to the rest of American society. Having benefited from low taxes and tax evasion, this elite has also been well served by the weakening of the public sector and the labor movement, and has every interest in the continued erosion of both. Tracing the history that illuminates Trump’s success in commanding popular attention and support is important, even if evidence of a wholesale shift of working-class voters to the Republican Party is far from conclusive. Yet more surprising, in certain ways, is watching those factions of the political and economic elite that have thrown in their lot with Trump and the broader agenda he represents. They have been willing to do more than back candidates who are openly skeptical of democracy, and to continue funding election deniers after promising to cut off support. Abandoning traditional corporate imperatives, especially the desire for stability, some in these circles have relied on the least democratic features of our system (the Supreme Court, the filibuster, the Electoral College) to advance their ends, and made this reactionary politics far more dangerous in so doing.How best to counter the politics of a Republican Party in thrall to Trump is not obvious. Milbank pleads with the republic to vote (presumably for Democrats), suggesting that the Republican project is an antidemocratic one that speaks for a declining rural white minority and will inevitably be defeated. Continetti rallies conservatives not to flee the scene but to stay and fight for the principles of classical liberalism. Only Hemmer proposes that the Democratic Party might also bear some culpability for the transformation of the partisan landscape—which implies that an overhaul of moral and political vision is crucial.One of the challenges of our moment is that so many forces seem poised to drive people out of what remains of public life. At some point, arguing with opponents galvanized by a completely different political calculus becomes enervating. It feels like shadowboxing, at a time when the issues our society confronts—the pandemic, climate change, the international role of the United States, stark economic inequality—have never been more pressing. The way forward is daunting because it calls for a new kind of politics that can generate the courage and strength to push back against a politics of fear and demonization. With all due respect to Margaret Chase Smith, the path doesn’t lie in trying to reconstruct the old order that helped open the door to our current crisis.*Lead image: Illustration by Paul Spella.

        "description": "Austin Wells | Photo by Chris Bernacchi/Diamond Images via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Many of the Yankees’ top prospects continue hitting as two of the affiliates approach the final week of the regular season. The Yankees’ High-A and Low-A affiliates will be playing meaningful games over the last week of the season. Both the Hudson Valley Renegades and Tampa Tarpons are in second place in their divisions, but within striking distance of the first-place teams down the stretch. At the higher levels, the franchise’s top prospect Anthony Volpe has reached Triple-A and is thriving out of the gate.\nLet’s take a look around the Yankees’ minor league system and see how the teams are faring and who is catching fire in the final month of the season. Scranton also played yesterday, so we’ll review their game as well.\nTriple-A Scranton-Wilkes Barre RailRiders \nRecord: 69-59; T-Fourth place in the International League (East), 3.5 GB\nPast Week: 5-1 vs. Syracuse Mets   \nComing Up: Away vs. Durham Bulls (Rays)\nScranton is 50-25 dating back to the start of play on June 7th. They have made up over 12 games in the standings in that time, but were unable to close too much ground even with a great week against the Syracuse Mets. They began a series with first-place Durham yesterday, and it could be a make-or-break week for the team.\nThe team’s most notable players continue to be called up to the Bronx to support the major league team, but Anthony Volpe has arrived and is off to a good start recording a hit in every Triple-A game to this point. MLB veteran Ronald Guzmán has been with Scranton all season but may be opening the door to an opportunity, as he has been crushing the ball down the stretch for the RailRiders (as John will discuss later today).\nPlayers of Note:              \nAnthony Volpe: 84 G; .286/.374/.523, 14 HR, 3 3B, 29 2B\nRonald Guzmán: 29 G; .370/.439/.740, 8 HR, 13 2B\nArmando Alvarez: 49 G; .309/.354/.588, 10 HR, 16 2B\nZach Greene: 11 G; 1.50 ERA, 18 IP, 11 H, 4 BB, 27 K \n\n\nRonald Guzmán with the two-run double. #RepBX #OffTheRails pic.twitter.com/HTwqUQdWKo— SWB RailRiders (@swbrailriders) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nAs previously noted, Scranton played yesterday for Labor Day, beginning their series against Durham with a loss.

With the No. 1 prospect Volpe now up in Triple-A Scranton, Everson Pereira, Austin Wells, and Andres Chaparro have picked up the slack and pounded the ball over the last few weeks. Eric Wagaman does not play every day, but he has also found his groove and has been crushing it since moving up to Double-A last month. The Yankees are handling the pitcher from the Joey Gallo trade, Clayton Beeter, in short stints, and he has thrived to this point. \nPlayers of Note: \nClayton Beeter: 5 G; 1.10 ERA, 16.1 IP, 7 H, 6 BB, 26 K \nEverson Pereira 15 G; .333/.387/.684, 4 HR, 2 3B, 4 2B\nEric Wagaman: 15 G; .429/.472/.714, 4 HR, 2 2B\nAustin Wells: 13 G; .348/.466/.739, 5 HR, 1 3B, 1 2B\nAndres Chaparro: 19 G; .314/.385/.643, 5 HR, 8 HR\n\n\nDon’t let Everson Pereira get hot The Yankees No. 5 prospect goes deep with his fifth Double-A home run to put us up 2-1! pic.twitter.com/GLILRyIgMP— Somerset Patriots (@SOMPatriots) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nHigh-A Hudson Valley Renegades \nSecond-Half Record: 35-24; Second place in the South Atlantic League (North), 0.5 GB \nOverall Record: 69-56 \nPast Week: 3-3 vs. Jersey Shore Blue Claws (Phillies)      \nComing Up: Away vs. Wilmington Blue Rocks (Nationals)    \nThe Renegades have played great baseball in the second half of the year and their season will come down to their final series. They are half a game back of the Brooklyn Cyclones, who will be playing the last place Winston-Salem Dash from the SAL South this week. The team is not short of hot hitters as Jasson Domínguez, Trey Sweeney (who was promoted to Somerset today), Tyler Hardman, and Aaron Palensky have all put together extended hot streaks.

The team will have seven games scheduled this week to both try and make up the ground in a playoff push and also try to get to .500 for the season.

        "description": "Fears grew Tuesday for Europe&#x27;s largest nuclear power plant as shelling around it continued, a day after the facility was again knocked off Ukraine&#x27;s electricity grid and put in the precarious position of relying on its own power to run safety systems.Repeated warnings from world leaders that fighting around the Zaporizhzhia plant has put it in an untenable situation that could lead to a nuclear catastrophe have done little to stem the hostilities. Russian-installed officials accused the Ukrainian forces of shelling the city where the plant is located on Tuesday, hours after the Ukrainians said Kremlin forces attacked a city across the river.Both sides have traded such accusations since Russian troops seized the plant early in the war. With the danger rising, an International Atomic Energy Agency team finally traveled to the plant last week, and inspectors are expected to report what they found to the U.N. Security Council later in the day.Two inspectors remain at the plant, which is run by Ukrainians workers, and Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak applauded that decision.“There are Russian troops now who don’t understand what’s happening, don’t assess the risks correctly,” Podolyak said. “There is a number of our workers there, who need some kind of protection, people from the international community standing by their side and telling (Russian troops): ‘Don’t touch these people, let them work.’”But that appears to have done little to lessen the risks. On Monday, the IAEA said Ukrainian authorities reported that the plant’s last transmission line was disconnected to allow workers to put out a fire caused by shelling.“The line itself is not damaged, and it will be reconnected once the fire is extinguished,” the IAEA said.In the meantime, the plant’s only remaining operational reactor would “generate the power the plant needs for its safety and other functions,” the agency said.Mycle Schneider, an independent analyst in Canada on nuclear energy, said that means the plant was likely functioning in “island mode,” producing electricity just for its own operations.“Island mode is a very shaky, unstable, and unreliable way to provide continuous power supply to a nuclear plant,” Schneider said.It was just the latest incident that fueled fears of a potential nuclear disaster in a country still haunted by the world&#x27;s worst nuclear accident at Chernobyl. Experts say the reactors at Zaporizhzhia are designed to withstand natural disasters and even aircraft crashes, but the unpredictable fighting around the plant had repeatedly threatened to disrupt critical cooling systems, raising the risk of a meltdown.Russian-installed officials in the Zaporizhzhia region on Tuesday accused the Ukrainian forces of shelling Enerhodar, the city where the plant is located, and damaging a power line close to the plant.Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported, citing its correspondent on the ground, that the power was off in Enerhodar on Tuesday and sounds of explosions could be heard.Meanwhile, Ukraine’s presidential office said that Russian forces shelled residential buildings in Nikopol, a city across the Dnieper river from the Zaporizhzhia plant. Two people were wounded and a school, a kindergarten and some 30 buildings were damaged, the office said.Russian shelling elsewhere killed at least three civilians, the statement said.In the southern Kherson region, occupied by the Russians since early on in the war, the Ukrainian army continued its counteroffensive, destroying Russia’s logistical centers. A pontoon bridge was blown up overnight and a command center was hit, as well as two checkpoints.In the eastern city of Sloviansk, workers with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society swept up debris Monday from a second rocket attack on its premises in a week. Nobody was hurt in either attack, said Taras Logginov, head of the agency’s rapid response unit. He blamed Russian forces and called the attacks war crimes.In a row of apartment buildings across the road, the few residents who haven’t evacuated sawed sheets of plywood to board up their shattered windows.Henadii Sydorenko sat on the porch of his apartment building for a break. He said he’s not sure whether to stay or leave, torn between his responsibility of taking care of three apartments whose owners have already evacuated and the increasing fear of the now frequent shelling.“It’s frightening,” the 57-year-old said of the shelling. “I’m losing my mind, little by little.”",

        "description": "Updated: 11:18 a.m.Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday called for lawmakers to back more public safety spending and tougher sentences for criminals after one person was shot just outside the Minnesota State Fair on Monday, two days after a person was shot at the fair’s Mighty Midway entrance.Walz said Monday night’s victim was discharged from the hospital with minor injuries and that police have a suspect in the shooting, which took place near Como and Snelling avenues just outside the fairgrounds.Saturday’s gunfire closed the fair more than an hour before its scheduled closing time that night when police officers in the area heard a shot and found someone with a non-life-threatening injury. Walz called on judges to issue harsher penalties for those involved in shootings, and he renewed his call for lawmakers to approve additional funding for public safety.&quot;There&#x27;s too many guns on the streets, and 15-year-olds with guns shooting someone or a 20-year-old being shot last night — we have got to make it as difficult as possible for folks to be getting these guns,” Walz said.The DFL governor said the shooters and the victims involved in both State Fair situations likely knew one another. He said that the victim in Monday night&#x27;s shooting, as well as the shooting at the fair Saturday, refused to cooperate with police.",

        "description": "Theatre Royal Drury Lane, LondonRalph Fiennes introduced this gala honouring the ballet legend, which boasted a dazzling lineup of dancers including Natalia Osipova and Cesar CorralesIntroducing this gala in honour of Rudolf Nureyev – a passion project directed by former Royal Ballet principal Nehemiah Kish – actor and director Ralph Fiennes invoked Nureyev the legend: the dancer whose global fame extended way beyond the sometimes hermetic world of dance, his dramatic defection from Soviet Russia in 1961 sweeping him up in the wider currents of the age, with its cold war divisions and incipient movements of personal liberation. Former Royal Ballet director Monica Mason spoke of his legacy within the dance world, and in fact the gala itself is about the dancing rather than the dancer, gathering an international roster of top-notch dancers in short extracts with backstory connections to Nureyev’s career.It began somewhat shakily, Guillaume Côté hesitant in Nureyev’s interpolated solo in The Sleeping Beauty which, shorn of dramatic context, in any case feels cut adrift. Two people on stage are already a drama, and Oleg Ivenko (star of The White Crow, Fiennes’ film about Nureyev) and Maia Makhateli fared better in the lilting leans and swaggers of a scene from Gayane – though Xander Parish and Iana Salenko looked oddly mismatched in the following Bayadère duet, she an icy apparition who seems to leave him not just cold, but nonplussed.At Theatre Royal Drury Lane, London, until 12 September.

        "title": "A Louisiana law keeps special needs kids from getting care — one woman wants to change it",
        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/3625810-a-louisiana-law-keeps-special-needs-kids-from-getting-care-one-woman-wants-to-change-it/",
        "description": "In a recent lawsuit, the Louisiana Department of Health admitted what every parent of a special needs child knows: There is always a need for more care for this population. Parents need time away from the rigors of child-rearing, whether it be to work, run errands, or simply have time to themselves.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYet state officials are blocking a longtime social worker, Ursula Newell-Davis, from offering care to special needs kids in New Orleans. In fact, they automatically deny nearly 75 percent of people who apply annually without regard to the applicant’s qualifications. In her lawsuit against the officials, the government defended the law for one reason: It said it would rather conserve its resources for doing things other than licensing new providers like her. So far, that argument has succeeded in court. \n\n\n\nNewell-Davis seeks to provide what’s called “respite services,” or short-term care for disabled children, adults and the elderly. Because she’s been a social worker for over two decades in New Orleans, she has seen that her clients often lack access to respite care. The unfortunate consequence is that sometimes kids are left alone. Left unsupervised, these children sometimes fail to take care of their hygiene, feed themselves, or change their clothes — leading to their being bullied in school for wearing the same thing two days in a row. Others turn to the wrong crowds and fall into crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlternatively, parents may forego time to themselves, with heartbreaking results. One of Newell-Davis’s former clients described falling into depression, losing her job, and then losing her home while struggling to take care of her special needs child without any support. Newell-Davis has been able to help New Orleans families through drug addiction, mental health challenges, and homelessness in her capacity as a social worker. Now she seeks to offer respite care, too. Her clients rave about her ability to connect with their kids, particularly special needs kids — a skill likely gained because Newell-Davis has a special needs child of her own. So in 2019, she sought to open a respite care business to serve the greater New Orleans area.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere is arguably nobody more qualified than she, but Louisiana has made her dream impossible. Before anyone can offer respite services in the state, they must undergo a Facility Needs Review with state health officials. This process has nothing to do with a person’s qualifications or fitness for the job; it relates solely to whether the state believes another care provider is “needed.” Newell-Davis included studies showing that early intervention results in better outcomes for children and described talking to local officials who encouraged her to apply. But in a two-page form letter, she was rejected solely because the state determined she wasn’t needed in New Orleans.  \n\n\n\nThis law might seem strange, but similar requirements are common in the health care industry. Louisiana’s Facility Need Review is just a variation of what’s called a “certificate of need” law in about half of states. These laws are little more than a protectionist regulation that allows established businesses, in alliance with state officials, to deny competitors the opportunity to enter the marketplace. \n\n\n\nIn other states, incumbent businesses can actually protest new applications and show up at their hearing to testify that no new company is needed. Research shows that need-review laws predictably lead to lower access to care, and there is no evidence that they lower costs or improve quality. Instead, they deprive people such as Newell-Davis of economic opportunity and keep disadvantaged populations from services they need.\n\n\n\nBecause need-review laws deprive people of their ability to earn a living without any discernible public benefit, they raise serious constitutional concerns. So, Newell-Davis sued, arguing that the law deprives her of liberty without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. That amendment was intended to guarantee individuals equal protection of the law and vast protection of civil rights, including the right to pursue a livelihood. But earlier this year, a federal court upheld Louisiana’s need-review law on the theory that it was rational for the state to focus its resources on regulating existing businesses, rather than protecting the right of individuals to start new ones.  \n\n\n\nNewell-Davis’s case is on appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which likely will decide her case sometime next year. In the meanwhile, she’ll continue her job as a social worker — hoping for the opportunity to provide kids with the care they need.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnastasia Boden is a senior attorney at Pacific Legal Foundation, a nonprofit legal organization that defends Americans’ liberties when threatened by government overreach and abuse. She fights for equality before the law and the constitutional right to earn a living, including Ursula Newell-Davis’s case. Follow her on Twitter @Anastasia_esq.",

        "description": "There are worse things to which you could fall asleep in a drunken stupor than James Clayton’s zippy directorial debutActor-producer James Clayton’s directorial debut features himself as a criminal without a name (he’s just called “The Thief”) but with a code of honour of sorts, stubble and an attractively croaky baritone voice. When he nicks a wodge of cash from a criminal gang led by Temple (Britain’s own hardman for hire, Vinnie Jones) and steals a car from one of Temple’s underlings, he finds a surprise in the trunk: Temple’s heavily pregnant wife Mia (Lina Lecompte). But the thief is a nice guy, so instead of, say, shooting his stowaway (who is trying to escape her violent husband) he brings her along with him as they try to shake the assorted hench-people Temple sends after them.Although the gobs of fisticuffs and gunfire that punctuate the plot are so generic they might as well have been designed by a video game algorithm, and the acting is merely adequate at best, the script credited to Cooper Bibaud, Danny Mac and Clayton has a bit of snap and crackle, with the odd genuinely wry one-liner and semi-clever gag. The excessively choppy editing, however, represents a major irritant – as does the over-insistent score that punctuates and underscores the action throughout with lots of urgent drumming and horn parps.

        "description": "The new German owner of Politico sent an email to his closest executives asking if they should meet up to pray for Donald Trump’s re-election, the Washington Post reports.\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the email, Mathias Döpfner initially denied it existed: “It has never been sent and has never been even imagined.” \n\n\n\nWhen confronted with a printout of the email, he explained that he may have sent it “as an ironic, provocative statement in the circle of people that hate Donald Trump.”",

Congress needs to handle a couple other must-pass issues — and Democrats may not do much else besides confirm judges.“\n\n\n\n“Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is committed to a vote at some point on the marriage equality bill, but has been circumspect about the timing. He said in August ‘we will have a vote on it. Not giving you a timetable,’ and emphasized the impending confirmation of Circuit Court judges.”\n\n\n\nPunchbowl News: “We’re hearing that Democratic congressional leaders are considering attaching a provision codifying same sex marriage protections onto a must-pass spending bill to keep the federal government open past Sept. 30.”",

And historical precedence is not in their favor.”\n\n\n\n“In all, Republicans need to net only five seats to win the gavel.

        "description": "The most powerful typhoon to hit South Korea in years on Tuesday dumped 3 feet of rain, destroyed roads and fell power lines, but the death toll of three could have been higher if not for proactive evacuations and closures of schools, officials said. There was also greater public awareness about the storm and its risks. Typhoon Hinnamnor made impact just weeks after heavy rains around the capital Seoul caused flooding that killed at least 14 people. Government officials had put the nation on high alert for days as Hinnamnor approached, warning of potentially historic destruction and putting in motion life-saving measures.After grazing the resort island of Jeju and hitting the mainland near the port city of Busan, Hinnamnor weakened as it blew into waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.South Korea’s weather agency said Hinnamnor was over the open sea 173 miles northeast of Ulleung island with winds weakened to 71 miles per hour on Tuesday afternoon. It was expected to be downgraded to a tropical cyclone by night as it moves northeast between Russia and the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, the agency said.However, the damage was still severe in the southern city of Pohang, where two people were found dead and at least seven others were missing after the storm submerged roads and buildings, triggered landslides and flooded a shopping mall.Cars with smashed windows and trunks open lay scattered on roads like garbage. An entire two-story pool villa was uprooted from the ground and swept away in flash floods. Troops were deployed to assist with rescue and restoration efforts, moving in armored vehicles rolling through streets that turned into chocolate-colored rivers. Firefighters navigated flooded neighborhoods in rubber boasts, rescuing people and their pets. Merchants scrambled to salvage furniture and other belongings at the famous Guryongpo outdoor market, where workers deployed excavators to clear huge piles of debris.The rain and flooding eroded the foundations of bridges and motorways, which were often broken in chunks or blocked by fallen trees and electricity poles. Factory buildings were tilted, while a shipping container blew away and landed above cars in a parking lot.“I woke up at 5 a.m. at because of the explosive rain, and I got really concerned because the water rose right up to my doorway,” Kim Seong-chang, a Pohang resident, said in an interview with JTBC. “The water was still thigh-high at 7 a.m. and those who parked their cars in the streets were in panic because their vehicles were submerged … Other residents were bucketing out water from their homes.”The storm dumped more than 41 inches of rain in central Jeju since Sunday, where winds peaked at 96 mph. Southern and eastern mainland regions also had damage — knocked off signboards and roofing, toppled trees, traffic signs and destroyed roads. In Pohang, a woman in her 70s died after being swept away in flash floods, while another woman in her 60s was found dead in a submerged basement parking lot where searches were ongoing for seven people. Rescue workers had failed to respond to another man who called for help before he went missing, presumably swept by flash floods. In the neighboring city of Gyeongju, a woman in her 80s died after her home was buried in a landslide. In Ulsan, another southern city, a 25-year-old man was unaccounted after falling into a rain-swollen stream, according to the Ministry of the Interior and Safety. Also in Pohang, firefighters extinguished flames that damaged at least three facilities at a major steel plant operated by POSCO. A presidential official, who spoke on condition of anonymity during a background briefing, said officials were investigating the cause of the fires.Local fire officials said the flames destroyed a building housing electricity equipment and damaged a separate office building and a cokes factory before being put out.The Safety Ministry said about 3,200 among 4,500 people who had been forced to evacuate returned home Tuesday afternoon. More than 80 homes, buildings and factories were flooded or destroyed, and hundreds of roads, bridges and facilities were damaged.More than 600 schools were closed or converted to online classes. Workers had managed to restore electricity to 78,890 of the 89,180 households that lost power.In North Korea, state media reported “all-out efforts” to minimize damage from flooding and landslides. The Korean Central News Agency reported leader Kim Jong Un during government meetings had issued unspecified “detailed tasks” to improve the country’s disaster response capacity but it didn’t elaborate on the plans.North Korea sustained serious damage from heavy rains and floods in 2020 that destroyed buildings, roads and crops, shocking the country’s already-crippled economy.",

        "description": "Bookmarked ‘They said it was impossible’: how medieval carpenters are rebuilding Notre Dame by Kim Willsher (The Guardian)\n\n\nKim Willsher discusses the importance of the Guédelon project in regards to the rebuilding of Notre Dame Cathedral. The Guédelon project focuses on using tools and methods available in the Middle Ages as an exercise in &#8216;experimental archaeology&#8217;:\n\nThe Guédelon project was dreamed up as an exercise in “experimental archaeology” 25 years ago. Instead of digging down it has been built upward, using only the tools and methods available in the Middle Ages and, wherever possible, locally sourced materials. Now, in an unforeseen twist of fate, Guédelon is playing a vital role in restoring the structure and soul of Notre Dame cathedral.\n@guardian https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/20/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-rebuild-medieval-carpenters-guledon?utm_source=pocket_mylist\n\n\nThe biggest challenge is hand-hewing each beam, rather than using a sawmill.\n\nStéphane Boudy is one of a small team of carpenters at the medieval site, where he has worked since 1999. Boudy, 51, trained as a baker, then an electrician, until discovering his vocation at Guédelon. He explains how hand-hewing each beam – a single piece from a single tree – respects the “heart” of the green wood that gives it its strength and resistance.\n&#8230;\n“This isn’t just nostalgia. If Notre Dame’s roof lasted 800 years, it is because of this. There’s no heart in sawmill wood,” he says.\n@guardian https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/20/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-rebuild-medieval-carpenters-guledon?utm_source=pocket_mylist\n\n\nI was intrigued by the &#8216;heart&#8217; of the wood, especially after watching Beau Miles video on saving wood from landfill. I wonder how much heart goes into much in today&#8217;s day and age?The post 📑 ‘They said it was impossible’: how medieval carpenters are rebuilding Notre Dame first appeared on Read Write Collect.",

There were 320 days until a home World Cup and a 1-0 friendly loss to Canada indicated – once again – that getting anywhere near the trophy was basically an insurmountable task. Tony Gustavsson, the man appointed to steer an underperforming Australia to said trophy, was starting to be seen as less like a nice-natured, slightly quirky man with a very good plan and more like a slick corporate type who delivers interesting TED talks but whose advice is not quite working for those he was hired to help.On Tuesday night, with 317 days to go, he emerged for the rematch at Allianz Stadium wearing a hospital-white hoodie and white trainers, Matildas merchandise around his neck and an earpiece that had him looking every bit the new-age life coach. He had just told media the previous day that he still had the backing of Football Australia and pleaded with external forces to trust in his process. Continue reading...",

in Washington are debating whether there will be a red wave this November and, if so, how large it might be. Yet, whether it turns out to be a wave or a ripple for Republicans, the twin tides of progressivism and populism are bringing a much larger wave that will crash down on businesses.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFrom The White House to statehouses, skepticism, scrutiny and pressure will rise as a new wave of politicians from both parties is elected in November for whom criticizing business has proven to be a resonant line of attack on the campaign trail and in office. This means businesses have more at stake this fall than just which party controls Congress and state legislatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile businesses may expect Republicans to form a bulwark against excessive regulation and taxation, with the party likely to gain control of the U.S. House and possibly the Senate, the reality may be quite different. Like Democrats after the 2018 midterm election, Republicans are sharpening their knives to exert full oversight authority over an executive branch held by the opposing party. Companies and industries could get caught in the crosshairs of GOP-led investigations, just as they did when Democrats took control in January 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThose investigations are likely to include the Biden administration’s COVID-19 response, and health care firms working on these efforts undoubtedly will find themselves ensnared in such oversight. With funds flowing to green energy projects, Republicans will search for the next Solyndra among the beneficiaries. Financial institutions should anticipate questions as a GOP majority looks into the Biden administration pressuring investors against financing fossil fuel projects and toward embracing a broad range of environmental, sustainability and governance (ESG) initiatives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the administration moves forward with Medicare drug price negotiations and other measures to rein in prescription costs, Republicans are likely to be both friend and foe to the pharmaceutical industry. Fintech firms may find themselves caught between regulators and legislators as Republicans scrutinize the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s aggressive approach. Even investigations seemingly disconnected from business, such as Hunter Biden’s overseas business endeavors, have the potential to disrupt U.S.-China relations and other trade interests.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThus, for a range of sectors, a Republican Congress may not translate into relief, even as President Biden dusts off the “phone and pen” of executive action, leaving businesses fighting a two-front war in Washington.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFurther complicating businesses’ ability to navigate both Congress and state legislatures will be the number of new members populating those chambers, many of whom will be less experienced and more ideological than their predecessors. With at least 56 open seats on congressional ballots and potentially more than two dozen incumbents losing in November, the 118th Congress will be one of the largest freshman classes in three decades. This shift also will happen in state legislatures, where newcomers will win one in four seats thanks to the highest level of open seats in five election cycles.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmong these open seats are legislative leaders such as Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, Rhode Island Senate Majority Leader Michael McCaffrey, and Wisconsin Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke. While the latter two decided to retire, rather than seek re-election in the face of primary challenges, Bowers was one of numerous Republican incumbents to lose in primaries this cycle. Thus far, Republican incumbents have been losing at over twice the rate of the past two election cycles, generally losing to more populist challengers. The same has been true to a lesser extent among Democrats.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs a result, when state legislatures are sworn in next year, majority parties are likely to grow even more dominant in more than two-thirds of state legislative chambers. In other words, red state legislatures are going to get redder and blue state legislatures will get bluer, with even more states under solitary party control. That means fewer checks on partisan excesses.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the political center has fewer representatives in government, companies will have to navigate this widening gap in policy direction between states. Moderate Democrats who held back the excesses of progressivism and the free market mantra of Republicans that similarly curtailed populist impulses have both ebbed in recent election cycles, and the expectations for November suggest they will remain far out at sea. This reality places businesses in a precarious position as they face mounting pressure to choose sides in the debate. Yet when businesses do take a stand — or no stand — they are bound to alienate a swath of policymakers and stakeholders. Firms must understand that while they may have earned and maintained a great deal of trust, it will take a lot to ensure that trust withstands the growing tide of politicization.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the wave of competing pressures from fresher, more partisan faces in Congress and state legislatures hits shores, businesses will have to adjust how they approach their advocacy. They cannot wait for the election results to begin assessing risks and challenges, or what range of stakeholders and policymakers will shape those outcomes. Smart firms are spending this fall waxing their surfboards to ride the coming wave as smoothly as possible. That means assessing where and how risks could emerge next year, and mapping which stakeholders are likely to be allies or opponents in those debates. Firms that wait to build the knowledge they need to form an effective strategy are more likely to be drowned in the wave.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJeff Berkowitz is the founder and CEO of Delve, a Washington-based competitive intelligence and risk advisory firm for companies and industries.

        "description": "Mike Baumann delivered a heck of an outing for Norfolk before joining the Orioles yesterday. | Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Baysox are battling for a playoff spot with two weeks remaining, while the IronBirds have a week to tune up before their postseason series begins. The Orioles’ 2022 playoff hopes might be on their last legs after yesterday’s dismal doubleheader sweep by the Blue Jays. But there’s still plenty to be excited about in Birdland, and much of it stems from a fruitful Orioles farm system that has churned out plenty of young talent throughout the year.\nWe’ve already seen the impactful debuts of Adley Rutschman, Kyle Bradish, Gunnar Henderson, and DL Hall — okay, that last one is still a work in progress — which have contributed greatly to the Orioles’ surprise success this year. And there’s no shortage of prospects continuing to make their way up the ladder.\nAs we do every week here at Camden Chat, let’s recap the week of minor league action, with a particular focus on CC’s composite list of the Orioles’ top 30 prospects.\nTriple-A Norfolk Tides\n\nLast week: 5-1 vs. Lehigh Valley IronPigs (Phillies)\nComing week: seven games at Memphis Redbirds (64-64, Cardinals)\nSeason record: 61-67, seventh place (11.5 GB) in International League East\n\nEven though #1 prospect Gunnar Henderson played just one game in this series — going 3-for-5 — before getting the call to the bigs, Norfolk’s offense didn’t miss a beat, pounding 37 runs in the Tides’ decisive series win. The arrival of Joey Ortiz (#24 tied) had a lot to do with that. Fresh up from Bowie, Ortiz continued to pound the ball in his first week at Triple-A, collecting a team-leading 10 hits — four for extra bases — and going a perfect 3-for-3 in stolen base attempts for good measure.\nColton Cowser (#5), who was promoted along with Ortiz last week, had a much slower start at his new level. The 2021 first-round pick had just three hits in 23 at-bats — one was a homer — and also struck out 13 times. Something tells me he’ll adapt. Meanwhile, Jordan Westburg (#6 tied) batted just .182 for the week, but two of his four hits were long balls, his 22nd and 23rd dingers this year. He also walked six times.\nThe Tides’ starting pitching was pretty stellar, as well. Mike Baumann (#20 tied) tossed a sensational outing — six innings, 13 strikeouts, and no earned runs — that prompted the O’s to promote him to the majors for yesterday’s doubleheader. Turns out the Toronto Blue Jays were a tougher opponent than the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, though Baumann held his own in the Orioles loss. Could he work his way back into the Birds’ September plans? A couple of other erstwhile Orioles, Bruce Zimmermann and Matt Harvey, combined for 13.2 shutout innings in their two starts, with Zimmermann too earning a return engagement with the Orioles yesterday.\nOther notable prospects:\n\nLHP Drew Rom (#15): The 2018 fourth-round pick is off to a strong start at Norfolk, posting a 2.45 ERA and 20 strikeouts in three starts since being promoted from Double-A, though he’s averaging more than a hit per inning. This week, Rom held the IronPigs to two runs in five frames, with 7 Ks and no walks.\nDouble-A Bowie Baysox\n\nLast week: 3-3 at Erie SeaWolves (Tigers)\nComing week: six games vs. Richmond Flying Squirrels (19-37 second half, Giants)\nSecond-half record: 36-21, tied for first place in Eastern League Southwest\nOverall season record: 63-63\n\nWhat an emotionally charged week this was for the Baysox, who went head-to-head against Erie, the team they’re tied for first place with...and ended the series still tied, thanks to a 3-3 split. The Sunday finale was Bowie’s league-worst 12th walkoff loss of the year, and featured a confrontation between the Baysox and the umpires after Bowie complained about a pitch near Andrew Daschbach’s head. Coby Mayo (#6 tied) had some choice words for the Erie dugout after bashing a game-tying homer in the ninth.\n\n\nIt's been a heated one today for Bowie and Coby Mayo ties it up with a big home run. Not great at reading lips but I'm pretty sure that was a \"our f***ing game\" from Mayo as he crossed home plate. Inject it directly into my veins pic.twitter.com/aO7n0uqZNW— The Verge- An Orioles MiLB Podcast (@BSLOnTheVerge) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nBowie and Erie don’t play each other again this year, so they’ll each look to break the deadlock in their final two weeks of games against other opponents. Each team has one remaining series against Richmond, while Bowie’s other series comes against Akron (currently 31-26) and Erie’s is against Altoona (30-26). This race could come down to the wire. Whoever wins the second-half title will face Richmond, the first-half champions, in the division series.\nThe offensive star for the Baysox, once again, was 2021 second-rounder Connor Norby (#12), who’s making a case that he should have been promoted to Norfolk along with Cowser and Ortiz. Norby blasted three home runs in the series, but was hit by a pitch on Saturday and missed Sunday’s game. Let’s hope it’s not a serious injury. Mayo, meanwhile, led the team with nine hits, though all were singles until that game-tying Sunday homer.\nOn the pitching side, lefty Cade Povich (#16) continued to impress since coming over in the Jorge Lopez trade. In his third start for Bowie, Povich held the SeaWolves to one run in six innings, striking out six and walking just one. He’s got a sub-1.00 WHIP and batters are hitting .169 against him in an admittedly small sample size of 16 innings. Fellow trade deadline acquisition Chayce McDermott (#19), part of the Trey Mancini deal, had six strikeouts and one run allowed in a five-inning start. He’s tossed two straight solid outings following two miserable ones to begin his Double-A career.\nOther notable prospects:\n\n\nIF César Prieto (#14): Early in the season, there was some hope that the 23-year-old signee from Cuba could move quickly through the O’s system, especially after dominating High-A, but he’s hit a wall at Bowie. After a 5-for-26 week, he’s hitting .263/.300/.361 with four homers in 82 games at Double-A.\n\nOF Hudson Haskin (#22): Haskin had just four hits, though, like Prieto, he knocked one of the eight Baysox home runs in the series. He’s slashing .269/.365/.462 with 14 home runs and is apparently a baseball magnet; he’s been hit by a pitch 22 times in 101 games.\n\nOF John Rhodes (#23): Landed on the IL with an undisclosed injury.\n\nIF Darell Hernaiz (#24 tied): In his first week at Double-A, Hernaiz had a pair of two-hit games, including his first homer, but went 0-for-16 in his other four. He struck out seven times without drawing a walk.\n\nHigh-A Aberdeen IronBirds\n\nLast week: 3-3 vs. Hickory Crawdads (Rangers)\nComing week: six games at Jersey Shore BlueClaws (22-38 second half, Phillies)\nSecond-half record: 33-27, third place (3.0 GB) in South Atlantic League North\nOverall season record: 76-50\n\nThe IronBirds will wrap up their regular season schedule this coming week, but they’re already postseason-bound thanks to their first-half division title. The best-of-three division series begins Sept. 13, pitting Aberdeen against the second-half champ, likely either Brooklyn or Hudson Valley.\nThe player who attracted the most attention in Aberdeen this week was a ringer. Grayson Rodriguez, the Orioles’ #2 prospect and the top pitching prospect in baseball, made his long-awaited return to the mound as he began a rehab assignment Thursday. Rodriguez faced six batters, giving up a leadoff single, retiring the next three, and then walking two in a row to end his night. It came exactly three months after he suffered a lat strain for Norfolk when was on the precipice of a big league call-up. Perhaps it can still happen in September. Rodriguez is slated to continue his rehab in Bowie this coming week. The Orioles’ Tyler Wells also made a rehab appearance for the IronBirds, giving up one hit and one run in 2.1 innings, fanning three.\nOffensively, this week the IronBirds flashed their speed (11 steals in 13 attempts) but not so much their power (just two homers). A number of hitters who excelled at Low-A have faced rougher waters since moving up to Aberdeen, most notably Heston Kjerstad (#9), whose 4-for-18 week has him hitting .215 with a .634 OPS and two homers in 38 games. He did have two doubles and a triple this week, at least. Also struggling: unranked infielder Frederick Bencosme, who is hitting .125 after a 1-for-15 week. It’s only been seven games, though. He’d been a hitting machine in Delmarva, batting .336 before his promotion.\nOther notable prospects:\n\n\nOF Jud Fabian (#17 tied): The 2022 draft pick made his High-A debut this week after sailing through Delmarva. He went 1-for-7 but did not play the last three games of the series. I haven’t found an explanation as to why, but no injury has been reported.\n\nRHP Jean Pinto (#28 tied): The 21-year-old reached the 100-strikeout mark for the season with three whiffs in a five-inning outing this week. His 10.3 K/9 rate is nice, his 4.2 BB/9 not so much.\n\nLow-A Delmarva Shorebirds\n\nLast week: 1-5 at Fredericksburg Nationals\nComing week: six games vs. Down East Wood Ducks (31-29 second half, Rangers)\nSecond-half record: 24-36, sixth place (12.5 GB) in Carolina League North\nOverall season record: 45-80\n\nThe Shorebirds have just six games remaining before this forgettable campaign comes to a close. Delmarva finished in last place in both the first and second halves of the season, and for much of the year was saddled with non-prospects. Lately, at least, the arrival of the 2022 draft picks has made this club more interesting to watch, if not any more successful on the field.\nJackson Holliday (#3), this year’s first overall draft pick, is holding his own at age 18, nearly three years younger than the average Low-A player. He had only four hits this week but showed a discerning batting eye with five walks. His .342 OBP in eight games at Delmarva outpaces his .194 AVG and .226 SLG. It’s Dylan Beavers (#10), the 33rd overall pick, who’s making the bigger impact so far. Beavers ripped nine hits — four more than any other Shorebird this week — which included four doubles. He’s been an extra-base hit machine in 16 games at Delmarva, collecting seven two-baggers and a pair of triples, though he’s still looking for his first professional home run.\nNo Delmarva pitcher worked more than five innings this week, so nobody particularly stood out. Except perhaps seven-foot lefty Jared Beck, who always stands out. This year’s 13th-round draft pick worked two not-particularly-sharp innings of relief. In seven pro innings so far, Beck has five walks and six strikeouts. The odds are stacked against him, but we’ll be pulling for him to someday arrive in the majors as the tallest pitcher in history.\nOther notable prospects:\n\nIF Max Wagner (#20 tied): The Birds’ second-round pick hit his first dinger as a pro. He’s got a .403 OBP in 13 games, thanks to nine walks.\n**\nNorby was the runaway winner of last week’s poll, bringing in 66 percent of the vote, making him our fifth multi-time winner. He’s back on the ballot this week after his power surge for Bowie. Other multiple winners are Kjerstad (three times), Cowser (twice), Henderson (twice), and Kyle Stowers (twice). One-time winners include Haskin, Kyle Bradish, Pinto, Mayo, Juan De Los Santos, Rodriguez, Westburg, Ortiz, Povich, and Fabian.",

Drew Waters won $100 from Zack Greinke for his first big league home run.\n\nAccording to Waters, who told the story after the Royals’ 6-5 loss in 10 innings to the Guardians, Greinke bet Waters shortly after he was called up that the rookie wouldn’t hit a home run for “the rest of the season.”\n“I was like, ‘All right, I hope he’s not putting the bad juju on me,’” Waters said. “But as soon as I went deep, that was the one guy I was looking for in the dugout. He actually wasn’t in the dugout, but as soon as he came back in, I was sure to go up to him and tell him he owed me a hundred.”\n\nGreinke will be activated and start on Wednesday.\n“He’s ready to go,” Matheny said. “Fortunately, he didn’t even need to do a rehab assignment. He did it here, got his work in. I know he’s wanting to be part of the mix. I’m just happy he’s feeling good.”\nKevin O’Brien at Royals Reporter thinks Tim Anderson’s defensive turnaround could be instructive for Bobby Witt Jr.\n\nAnderson made his debut for the White Sox in 2016, playing in 98 games. However, 2017 was his first full season in the Majors for a “rebuilding” White Sox team, and as I noted on Twitter yesterday, the defensive numbers, especially advanced metrics, weren’t pretty.\nAnderson’s numbers are similar to what Witt has done this year. If anything, Witt’s numbers have been slightly better, and for context, Anderson had a full season to play shortstop for the White Sox that season (i.e. he wasn’t flip-flopping between positions like Witt).\n\nScott Barlow was on MLB Network last week.\n\n\n\"I think in previous years watching the other guys going about their business\" - @Royals closer Scott Barlow on what's helped him find success this season#HighHeat | #TogetherRoyal | @alannarizzo pic.twitter.com/kg8dQWY1Ac— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nDaniel Mengden cleared waivers and was outrighted to Omaha.\nMike Gillespie at Kings of Kauffman wonders if this is a lost season for Salvador Perez.\nBaseball Trade Values ranks the farm system with the Royals at #27.\nFormer Royals outfielder Andrew Benintendi suffers a broken wrist bone with the Yankees.\nAaron Judge hits home run #54, tying the most by a Yankees right-handed hitter in a season.\nKevin Gausman was livid about a balk call against him.\nThe Red Sox sign Enrique Hernandez to a one-year contract extension.\nJacob deGrom is reaching a whole new level of dominance.\nWander Franco will resume his minor league rehab assignment.\nTen statistical races that could go down to the wire.\nTwenty-two-year-old Munetaka Murakami becomes the youngest Japanese player to hit 50 home runs.\nHow College Football Playoff expansion will affect realignment, job security and the future of the sport.\nCM Punk unloads on Colt Cabana and AEW executives in a press conference.\nHow the TSA is a failure.\nThe most popular content on Facebook is old, lame memes.\nHow horror films reconstitute popular non-scary songs to make them terrifying.\nYour song of the day is The Clash with Rock the Casbah.",

        "description": "The thrilling first single from the singer’s tenth album is an apocalyptic almost-dance track which pairs experimental techno with pulsing clarinets Björk’s last album, 2017’s Utopia, was a vision of paradise. Filled with birdsong and built around a 12-piece Icelandic flute section, it was one of the avant garde icon’s sweetest, quietest records, a suite of pastoral orchestration and hushed electronics that acted as an emotional counterweight to 2015’s Vulnicura, an album about her protracted, devastating divorce. In the intervening five years, during which Björk has been largely out of the public eye, it’s been easy to imagine her inhabiting some version of the world of Utopia, surrounded by lushness and beauty.Atopos, the first single from her forthcoming tenth album Fossora, breaks that illusion. An ominous, clattering, almost-dance track made with Indonesian experimental duo Gabber Modus Operandi, it finds Björk shattering the idealism of her last record, replacing it with a steely pragmatism: “Pursuing the light too hard is a form of hiding,” she sings. A six-piece clarinet section swells beneath her, their discordant palpitations preventing the song from ever easing into the frantic techno rhythm that Gabber Modus Operandi’s hammering beat is trying to create. Although Björk is no stranger to abrasive textures, this is one of the more dramatic left turns of her career, and it’s a thrill to hear her paint with the brutalist tones of experimental techno.

        "description": "Six months into Ukraine’s defiant stand against Russia’s invasion, The Atlantic is publishing a special cover package devoted to life in the country and the state of the war, with new, on-the-ground reporting by staff writers George Packer, Anne Applebaum, and Franklin Foer. Packer, Applebaum, and Foer are three of the most influential and established voices on the perils of war, authoritarian threats to democracy, and Ukrainian and Russian politics.\r\n\r\nTaken together, their features tell the story of life on the front lines of democracy. Ukrainians (and their neighbors) are rallying to save their nation and defend democratic values—values under strain on American soil. As Applebaum writes in her profile of Belarusian fighters volunteering with the Ukrainian army, “Those of us who live in luckier countries, with better geography, don’t know what it feels like to have a choice between fighting and exile, but all of the people sweating in this field truly do.”\r\n\r\nThe cover stories from The Atlantic’s October issue are publishing online today through Thursday, September 8. Details about all three follow; please be in touch with requests to speak with Packer, Applebaum, and Foer about their reporting.\r\n\r\nJoin The Atlantic for an extended conversation about this reporting at The Atlantic Festival in Washington, D.C., happening September 21–23. Tickets and more details are available at theatlanticfestival.com. “On Democracy’s Front Lines,” by George Packer\r\n“I told myself and others that Ukraine is the most important story of our time, that everything we should care about is on the line there,” George Packer writes in the first feature to publish. Packer has spent a career witnessing war. In Ukraine, he found ordinary citizens mobilizing as a national community, risking their lives to defend their young democracy. The Ukrainians, he writes, offer “a model of what we all believe to be good and want for ourselves—courage and freedom and unity.”\r\n\r\nDeparting for Ukraine, Packer felt a sense of dread, though “not of the place I was going, but of the place I was leaving behind, of the ‘Let’s Go Brandon’ signs and the school-board showdowns and the next mass shooting, the prospect that our experiment in people coming from all over to run their own affairs together was finished. For the first time in my life, I felt hopeless about America.”\r\n\r\nOn the ground in Ukraine, by contrast, he is inspired by the energy and unity of the people. “Nearly everyone I met had looked for something to do as soon as Russia attacked—some way to be useful without waiting for instructions from a higher authority.” Doctors are leaving their practices to train civilians in combat medicine; a priest drove military material 700 miles across Ukraine to the front lines; volunteers make phone calls to Russian citizens with the aim of slowly puncturing the Kremlin’s bubble of lies. Nearly every Ukrainian whom Packer met shared an optimism about the war’s outcome. He heard time and again: “We will win.” And also: “No compromise.”\r\n\r\n“The Belarusian Volunteers,” by Anne Applebaum, publishing September 7\r\nApplebaum embeds with a band of volunteer fighters from Belarus who are taking up arms in Ukraine in the hopes of bringing change to their own country. The men of the Kalinouski Regiment that Applebaum meets are young, in their 20s and 30s, some with careers in computer programming, and options other than fighting in Ukraine’s war. But they have volunteered for the fight because they sympathize with Ukraine’s democratic cause and because they hope, eventually, to liberate Belarus from the dictatorship of Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power for nearly three decades.\r\n\r\n“We didn’t finish our revolution, we didn’t remove Lukashenko, we didn’t prevent Russian troops from crossing our border to attack Ukraine—all of these are reasons, now, to fight in Ukraine,” Applebaum writes.\r\n\r\nThe men of the Kalinouski Regiment, Applebaum continues, “believe that if they lean hard on the scales of history and help the Ukrainians win, then both Russia and its Belarusian satrap will be far weaker. They could pay a high price—not just with their time and effort but with their lives … But if they don’t fight, they might pay another kind of price: If Ukraine loses and Russia is empowered, then Belarus will remain a dictatorship, and they will never be able to go home.”\r\n\r\n“The Operator,” by Franklin Foer, publishing September 8\r\nThe journalist Sergii Leshchenko has a knack for inserting himself into the pivotal moments of Ukraine’s history. His reporting helped lead to the demise of the Russian-backed kleptocrat Viktor Yanukovych; later, he made a cameo in American politics, when he revealed the existence of a “black ledger,” containing records of illicit payments, that led to the resignation of Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Eventually, Leshchenko won a seat in Parliament. “I wanted to see the war through his eyes,” Foer writes, “to understand how the country had survived the Russian onslaught—and whether the war had changed the trajectory of Ukraine’s still nascent democracy.”\r\n\r\nWhen Russia attacked, Leshchenko, who had been appointed to the board of Ukraine’s national railway, packed a backpack and joined a small band of executives attempting to keep the trains running as Russian soldiers poured across the borders. He witnessed—and played a role in—a remarkable effort that allowed a nation under attack to move citizens to safety. Later, Leshchenko went to work for Volodymyr Zelensky in the presidential bunker, connecting the Ukrainian president with influential figures in the West and using his skills as an investigative reporter to debunk the onslaught of Russian disinformation. Foer traveled to Kyiv to meet with Leshchenko and to view the war from his unique vantage point.“Ukraine Defiant” is the cover package of The Atlantic’s October 2022 issue, which will continue to publish across the next two weeks.

        "description": "Photo by Luiz C. Ribeiro for NY Daily News via Getty Images\n    \n\n  With two days left on the homestand, let’s look at some Dodgers news and notes. \nBill Shaikin at the Los Angeles Times visited the Jackie Robinson Museum in New York, noting that it’s far from just an ode to Robinson’s baseball career. Says Shaikin of the museum, which opened to the public Monday, “The ultimate mission of the museum — not simply to share how Robinson made a difference, but also to encourage that you do the same.”\nBill Plunkett at the Orange County Register compared this year’s Dodgers team to the 2017 team, off to a similar record at this point in the season. Said Justin Turner, “I think 2017 was a good team. This is a good team,” Turner said. “I don’t know that I want to draw a comparison because I don’t like the way that year ended.”\nWalker Buehler spoke with reporters on Sunday about the long, uncertain road back from his second Tommy John surgery. Jack Harris at the Los Angeles Times has more, including this from Buehler: “I’ve done this rehab, obviously, pretty successfully once before so I think that gives you some confidence. ... But at the same time, it is the second one, so the numbers aren’t quite as clear-cut or in your favor like the first one.”\nOld friend Enrique Hernández reached agreement with the Red Sox on a $10 million contract for 2023, per Jeff Passan of ESPN.\nAaron Judge hit his 54th home run on Monday, 18 more than any other player in the majors. The Yankees have played 135 games, putting Judge on pace for 65 home runs, which would be an American League record.",

        "description": "Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Colorado Rockies news and links for Tuesday, September 6, 2022 The Colorado Rockies find themselves at the bottom of a unique National League reliever category — one that makes a season-ending injury to Lucas Gilbreath even more costly:\n  \n        \n  \nThe Rockies have used 16 total relievers if position players Randal Grichuk and Brian Serven are factored out.\nColorado must reallocate Gilbreath’s work for the 26 games that remain in 2022.\nRewind to early June: an ulnar nerve injury to Tyler Kinley was an abrupt ending to a potential All-Star campaign. Kinley’s consistent performance helped everybody, not just from his sustained late-inning dominance, but from keeping others from entering his games and further tiring the bullpen. \nGilbreath was recently placed on the injured list due to a flexor strain in his throwing arm. He had made the fourth-most pitching appearances for the Rockies this year, and with Colorado now fifth in the National League West, there is no big need to rush his recovery.\nFor the active bullpen that remains, September gets complicated.\nWith Colorado’s limited reliever depth and production in the early season, the bullpen phone in Albuquerque may have well been a direct line to the Coors Field front office. The reserve in Triple-A has been limited, however, as the Isotopes have a team ERA of 6.86 this year (the highest in the Pacific Coast League).\nChad Smith and Justin Lawrence have bounced between Triple-A and the big leagues for much of this season, a role that Gilbreath covered in early 2021. It could be by default that Smith and Lawrence are automatic fillers through the finish line.\nThe Challenges\nSeptember relief work can serve as a great developmental opportunity for younger arms, including current big leaguers and minor league prospects. The Rockies have unique roadblocks to overcome, however:\n\nBurnout could be real. It’s been a long season, Coors Field is laborious for pitchers, and workloads have already jumped with Kinley out since June.\nIf the Rockies had a deeper bullpen reserve, one could argue the club would have already used more relievers than a NL-fewest 18 this year.\n\nRetrace Some Steps\nBefore we go further: Relief pitcher Robert Stephenson was designated for assignment last month and has since been claimed off waivers by the Pirates. Judging by this move, bullpen depth was not a big enough concern for the Rockies to keep him around.\n— but —\nIf the extent of Gilbreath’s injury was known a few weeks earlier, would Stephenson still be in a Colorado uniform?\nThe Immediate Bullpen\nGilbreath’s IL placement in late August came on the same day Alex Colomé returned from injury, so a linear swap helped some immediate needs for relief pitching.\nThe Rockies did recall Chad Smith from Triple-A on September 1 (he had been there since August 6). This may suggest that bullpen depth is currently a greater concern in Albuquerque than it is in Denver, but with any late-inning struggles this month, the Rockies could quickly show a priority and tap into a reserve.\nIf it comes to it, there are two ways to satisfy that bullpen need: a waiver pickup or a call-up. There are some options, if needed:\nTy Blach\nPerhaps the easiest move: Blach was recalled as the 27th man for the Rockies’ Monday doubleheader. He has been pitching as a Triple-A reliever exclusively since late July, and the Rockies wouldn’t need to adjust their 40-man roster if Blach were called up.\nThe following names are pitchers on the outside looking in; it doesn’t mean they ‘cannot’ be called up, but it could take far more than a dominant early September:\nJulian Fernández\nPerhaps your favorite fireballer: Fernández was chucking 103 MPH for the Rockies this time last year. (His heaters were enjoyed a little more than his tough 10.80 ERA.) Designated for assignment in early June, Fernández cleared waivers and has pitched exclusively with Triple-A Albuquerque this year.\nAfter a tremendous July (10 2⁄3 IP, 1.69 ERA), he suddenly allowed more contact in August (12 1⁄3 IP, 8.03 ERA). Fernández hasn’t allowed an earned run in five of his last six outings (7 2⁄3 IP), but his collective body of work (and non-40-man roster status) could limit him to Albuquerque for the rest of the year.\nLogan Allen\nAn arm with nearly 100 MLB innings to his name: Allen was quietly signed by the Rockies in late August and has since pitched seven innings in Triple-A (6.43 ERA). This is a move that could fill a left-handed hole without Gilbreath, but it would also require a separate move to make room on the 40-man roster.\nAllen’s signing could have been for Albuquerque to simply reach the 2022 finish line, which might explain why the deal wasn’t highly publicized. Don’t rule out a 2023 spring training invite for this veteran, however.\nZach Lee\nLike Fernández, it has been a roller coaster-type year for Lee. A strong July (2.31 ERA, 11 2⁄3 IP) was followed by a tough August (6.97 ERA, 10 1⁄3 IP). Lee had a particularly tough outing on August 24 against Round Rock (2⁄3 IP, 6 ER), but without it, he’s been throwing quite well since July 1. \nRiley Pint\nHold your enthusiasm for a moment: Pint hasn’t pitched since August 18 and is currently on the Triple-A injured list. This alone could keep him off the mound for the rest of the season.\nHe does have a sub-three ERA since July 1 (between Double-A Hartford and Triple-A Albuquerque), so we’re at least closer than ever to his long-anticipated debut. There is still a decent amount of time left on the Triple-A schedule this year, too.\n(How cool would it be if Wynton Bernard AND Riley Pint were called up in the same year?)\nWaiver Options\nThe Rockies picked up Dinelson Lamet on waivers in the middle of the season. Arms like Hirokazu Sawamura from the Red Sox have been available for similar pickup in recent days; while a move like this may not plan for the future, it could fall in an ‘experience’ category.\nIt could be a safe bet to assume Blach is the candidate for a big league call, given his roster status and MLB tenure. Much can still be proven in the waning days of 2022, however.\n★ ★ ★\nLucas Gilbreath out for year with elbow injury | Rox Pile\nIt has been a strong 2022 for Gilbreath since some early-season woes sent him down to Triple-A. His journey is further detailed in this link from Rox Pile, along with some quotes from Rockies manager Bud Black on the injury-induced course of action. Gilbreath is set to receive a PRP injection in his throwing arm in an effort to expedite his healing process.\nRockies starter Ryan Feltner, a year after his debut, continues to improve\nIt has been more than the bullpen struck with injury woes; after starting pitcher Antonio Senzatela suffered a season-ending ACL tear, the Rockies have been forced to navigate the remainder of 2022 with a tough absence in the starting rotation. Ryan Feltner had established his spot well before Senzatela’s injury, and his steps forward this year have helped the club find some stability following the loss of Jon Gray.\nThe Rockies’ rotation has seen Austin Gomber designated to the bullpen, José Ureña acquired in the middle of the season and Ty Blach demoted to Triple-A, so the stability from Feltner has served as a great developmental headline.\nBonus Headline: Wynton Bernard is back in Albuquerque\nThe Albuquerque Isotopes were on the road last week in Texas when Wynton Bernard was optioned back to Triple-A. Since being sent down, Bernard has posted a scorching hot batting slash of .417/.579/.583 (5-for-12) in four games.\nHe’s due for a thunderous applause at Isotopes Park tonight.\n★ ★ ★\nOn the Farm\nMonday, September 5: League-wide off day for all minor league affiliates\nNew series starting today:\nTriple-A: El Paso Chihuahuas (SD) at Albuquerque Isotopes (COL)\nDouble-A: Somerset Patriots (NYY) at Hartford Yard Goats (COL)\nHigh-A: Spokane Indians (COL) at Tri-City Dust Devils (LAA)\nLow-A: Fresno Grizzlies (COL) at San Jose Giants (SF)\n★ ★ ★\nPlease keep in mind our Purple Row Community Guidelines when you’re commenting.

        "description": "The Royal Northern Sinfonia’s principal oboist pays tribute to the orchestra’s much loved former music director; and, below, Ian Bostridge remembers a revelatory accompanist, an ideal chamber musician and a friend of grace and generosityIn January 2014, Lars Vogt stepped on to the stage at Sage Gateshead to make his UK conducting debut with Royal Northern Sinfonia. Lars had an endearing and quiet confidence, even when trying something new. I have witnessed him speaking at least nine foreign languages and presumed he was fluent on the assurance of the delivery, later discovering he only knew a few words. But fluency in the language of music was something Lars possessed in captivating abundance. And it turned out he could express this just as well with a baton in his hand: just a few weeks after the final chords of Beethoven’s 4th Symphony had finished resonating around the hall, it was announced Lars was to become our next music director.Starting his tenure in September 2015, Lars spoke of the “instant connection” he felt with the orchestra. This connection quickly and organically grew into something I have never known between an orchestra and music director: a collective trust and spirit of generosity between orchestra and maestro, borne not just of admiration for his talents and the music we were making, but also a love for his unfailing kindness and warmth.

        "description": "Royal Albert Hall, LondonBetsy Jolas’s bTunes is a witty ode to our attention-sapping times, while Karina Canellakis commanded Mahler’s First Symphony with an expressive and sharply etched performance“I am, at 96, practically the last of my generation,” writes Betsy Jolas. “Since most of my great colleagues have, alas, left this world ... I am today constantly called upon to ‘testify’ on the now historical music movements many of them represent.” Following trends, she says, has helped her evaluate the situation today: “Most people’s attention to music has shrunk drastically to barely 10 seconds. This observation has been echoed in much of my music.”Hence bTunes, Jolas’s new piano concerto, which Nicolas Hodges introduced with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Karina Canellakis. The similarity of its title to the name of a well-known digital music service is not at all coincidental, for the punchy 15-minute piece is essentially a series of brief musical vignettes, using material reworked from Jolas’s previous piano miniatures and songs, to which the orchestra (classically sized, with a harp and extra percussion) adds some continuity and commentary.Available on BBC Sounds until 10 October.

        "description": "Dan Brink\n    \n\n  Judge tied a Yankees record yesterday and did his part to keep pace with home run hitters of yore. Welcome back to the Aaron Judge Home Run Record Tracker! We’re taking a daily look at where Aaron Judge’s monster season tracks compared to some of the other historic single-season home run leaders in anticipation of Judge potentially joining their ranks. We’ll be going by Team Game because not every player’s seasons were in sync with the calendar days and everyone didn’t play all of the team’s games, which makes this our universal standard. Now, for Game 135:\nAaron Judge through Game 135 of 2022: 54 HR\nTeam Game 135: 9/5 — 2-for-3, 1 2B, 1 HR, 1 BB, 1 K\nNo. 99 played his part in a Labor Day win, homering for the third game in a row to reach tie Alex Rodriguez’s Yankees record for right-handed hitters with his 54th homer. The blow came on one of the fattest pitches that you’ll ever see, courtesy of Twins right-hander Trevor Megill. You can’t leave 88-mph sliders in the middle of the zone to a guy like Aaron Judge, who is now right up there with the home run paces of Mark McGwire, Roger Maris, and Sammy Sosa.\n\nRoger Maris through Game 135 of 1961: 53 HR\nTeam Game 135: 9/2 — 3-for-4, 1 2B, 2 HR, 3 RBI, 1 K\nAfter failing to homer for a week, Roger Maris kicked the schneid in impressive fashion, as he launched a pair of homers against “Yankee Killer” Frank Lary and southpaw Hank Aguirre of the Tigers in a pivotal game during the 1961 American League pennant chase.\nThe ‘61 Yanks are remembered as one of the best teams in franchise history with 109 wins, but those Tigers were no joke — they won 101 on their own and began September within three games of New York. But Maris’ bombs were part of a big series for Ralph Houk’s ballclub, as they swept and the race was never close again.\n\nBabe Ruth through Game 135 of 1927: 49 HR\nTeam Game 135: 9/8 — 0-for-1, 3 BB, 1 K\nBabe Ruth’s former teammate, Sad Sam Jones, did not do The Bambino any favors in his pursuit of No. 60. He was walked in his first three plate appearances and hit a foul popup in the seventh, his only official at-bat. Lame! Pitching around Ruth only did so much though, as New York scored twice and leaned on Hall of Fame pitcher Waite Hoyt in a three-hitter for a complete-game win.\nBarry Bonds through Game 135 of 2001: 57 HR\nTeam Game 135: 8/31 — 1-for-4, 1 HR, 2 RBI, 1 K\nIt took Barry Bonds until his final at-bat in a listless 5-1 loss to the Rockies before the fans in San Francisco had anything to really cheer about in this game, but the man delivered. Bonds annihilated right-hander John Thomson’s final pitch of the night for No. 57, deep into McCovey Cove. That shot made him just the third player in National League history to reach that threshold, joining Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, and passing longtime NL record holder Hack Wilson of the 1930 Cubs.\n\nMark McGwire through Game 135 of 1998: 54 HR\nTeam Game 135: 8/28 — 1-for-3, 1 2B, 2 BB, 2 K\nThe elder Fernando Tatis hit a game-tying homer in the bottom of the ninth off the Braves’ Kerry Ligtenberg to give Mark McGwire an extra plate appearance in his bid to reach 55 dingers, but it was not to be on this night. The 23-year veteran Dennis Martínez — “El Presidente” himself” — struck him out in the 10th to keep McGwire homerless; teammate Ron Gant walked it off two batters later.\nSammy Sosa through Game 135 of 1998: 53 HR\nTeam Game 135: 8/28 — 1-for-4, 1 HR, 1 RBI, 1 BB (IBB), 1 GIDP\nAmusingly, the same Rockies pitcher who coughed up 2001 Bonds’ bomb in Game 135 gave up a homer to 1998 Sammy Sosa in Game 135 as well. On the earlier occasion, it happened in the very first inning — no surprise at Coors Field. That shot moved Sosa within one of McGwire, though he did not get any closer in his remaining at-bats.",

        "description": "Sixteen people were killed and 47 were injured in the U.S. as a result of mass shootings over the long Labor Day weekend, according to watchdog data.\n\n\n\nThe nonprofit Gun Violence Archive logged 12 mass shootings Sept. 3-5. \n\n\n\nThree people were killed and two others injured in St. Paul, Minn., on Sunday in the deadliest incident. Police have confirmed a suspect has been identified for the triple homicide, local media reported, but authorities haven’t released further details, citing the ongoing investigation. The victims were identified on Monday.\n\n\n\nLaw enforcement officials in Philadelphia, meanwhile, are still searching for a shooter who killed two people and injured four on Monday. Two of the injured victims are in critical condition. \n\n\n\nAt least 10 people were also shot and one killed in Cleveland on Monday, according to local news outlets, and police are looking for a suspect and motive.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother shooting in Norfolk, Va., left two people dead and five injured. Among the victims were students at Norfolk State University, according to the school.\n\n\n\nThe Gun Violence Archive notes there have been more than 30,000 gun violence deaths, including suicides, to date in 2022, and 464 mass shootings in which four or more people were shot or killed, excluding the shooter.\n\n\n\nThe House Oversight and Reform Committee, led by Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), is investigating gun violence and the firearm industry in the wake of recent high-profile mass shootings, like the Robb Elementary School massacre that left 19 children and two teachers dead in Uvalde, Texas.\n\n\n\nA recent report by the committee found that major gun manufacturers earned more than $1 billion from sales of military-style assault weapons, often used in the deadliest mass shootings, to Americans.",

        "description": "2022 started as a typical midterm contest. During the spring and early summer, President Biden’s approval ratings fell dramatically as inflation tightened its grip on the economy. By June, Biden’s numbers cratered at 37 percent — lower even than President Trump’s 40 percent at a similar point in 2018. Skyrocketing gas and grocery prices served as de facto campaign signs for Republican candidates. Using President Obama’s memorable 2010 phrase, Democrats were poised for a “shellacking.”\n\n\n\nThat Republicans were poised for victory validated a political truism — that first term presidents suffer defeats in midterm elections. History proves the point. In 1982, President Reagan’s Republicans lost 26 House seats. That year, 47 percent disapproved of Reagan’s performance, and 51 percent gave him a grade of D or F in handling unemployment, which had risen to 10.8 percent.\n\n\n\n1994 was a disaster for another presidential newcomer. President Clinton’s Democrats lost 54 House seats, and Republicans gained control of that body for the first time in four decades. Clinton’s ban on assault weapons, and his “don’t ask, don’t tell” order permitting gays to serve in the military were met with fierce resistance. “HillaryCare” also proved deadly, as the first lady offered a complex health care plan that few could decipher. \n\n\n\n2010 was another debacle for a beginner president. Forty-seven percent disapproved of Obama’s health care law, and Democrats lost their congressional majorities. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) stated that his “top political priority” was to make Obama a one-term president, and the midterm result seemed to prove his point.\n\n\n\nThe axiom that midterms produce failing grades for rookie presidents points to another truism — the harsh realities they face once in office are quite different from the eutopias promised during their campaigns. Even the rare presidents who defied the conventional wisdom illustrate the point. In 1934, Democrats increased their congressional majorities to a staggering 322 House members and 76 senators. The results were a validation of President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal.\n\n\n\nIn 2002, President George W. Bush won belated ballots thanks to his ability to unite the country behind him after the 9/11 attacks. That year, Republicans gained eight House seats and two senators. Both elections were previews of coming attractions. In 1936, FDR routed the Republicans and won 5 million more votes than in 1932. In 2004, national security was a potent issue, and George W. Bush defeated John Kerry because of it.\n\n\n\nAnother cardinal rule is that while midterms are referendums, presidential elections are choices. In 1984, Reagan castigated former Vice President Walter Mondale as a “tax and spend” Democrat. In 1994, Clinton painted Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kansas) as a throwback to a dated past. Eight years later, Obama cast Mitt Romney as an out-of-touch plutocrat. Biden likes to quote his Dad’s aphorism: “Joey, don’t compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative.” Presidential contests bear out the truism behind Biden’s oft-repeated line.\n\n\n\nThis year is different. Biden has rebounded from his summer doldrums thanks to falling gasoline prices, some easing of inflation and using his presidential pen to make big things happen. When asked about specific provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, 71 percent support allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices; 65 percent approve extending health insurance subsidies for middle-income Americans; and 61 percent want businesses earning $1 billion or more to pay a minimum 15 percent corporate income tax.\n\n\n\nAs for Biden’s executive order forgiving $10,000 in student loans, 46 percent say they are more likely to back a congressional candidate supporting the measure, while 33 percent are less likely. Sixty-five percent approve of Biden’s infrastructure law, which is the largest government investment since the Federal Highway Act was signed by President Eisenhower in 1956. Finally, 64 percent like the recently passed gun legislation, and 63 percent think Congress needs to do more — something Republicans have staunchly resisted.\n\n\n\nBut this election is about more than Biden’s compelling message. Once again, Donald Trump is dominating the headlines. The search warrant of his Mar-a-Lago estate and the recovery of classified information there potentially violates several federal laws and is currently under intense investigation.\n\n\n\nIn Georgia, prosecutors are looking into Trump’s involvement in attempting to “find 11,780 votes” that would have invalidated Biden’s win in the Peach State. New York’s attorney general is investigating whether the Trump Organization misled lenders and tax authorities. And the Jan. 6 hearings will resume in September after devastatingly portraying Trump as actively engaged in an insurrection.\n\n\n\nEach day’s headlines are filled with new investigative details and courtroom dramas. Not surprisingly, Trump’s approval numbers have suffered: 54 percent view him negatively, and 50 percent want him prosecuted for his mishandling of top-secret documents. Moreover, the overturning Roe v. Wade by the Trump-packed Supreme Court has been met with overwhelming disapproval. Fifty-eight percent reject the court’s decision, and suburban women along with young voters are newly energized to vote against Republicans in November.\n\n\n\nBiden has a disconcerting habit of finding himself with his back to the wall and digging deep to stage a comeback. This Harry Truman-like quality has made a mockery of pundit wizardry.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, Biden suffered devastating losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, and political prognosticators were writing his political obituary before he bounced back in South Carolina. The start of this year’s campaign found Biden facing even more daunting circumstances. But in a prime-time address last week, Biden found his voice, casting the “MAGA Republicans” as extremists who threaten “the very foundations of our republic.” Trump, meanwhile, has labeled Biden “an enemy of the state.”\n\n\n\nAll of a sudden, the conventional wisdom has been upended. While the outcomes of the 2022 contests remain uncertain, the old rules no longer apply. 2022 has become a tale of two presidents. We have reached the political equivalent of finding ourselves on Mars. Surprises await.\n\n\n\nJohn Kenneth White is a professor of politics at The Catholic University of America.

Spahn picked off Jackie Robinson twice and allowed just five hits. Johnny Sain won 4-0 in the nightcap. The combo will start 11 of the next 16 games for the Braves. \n1952 - Sid Gordon goes 5-for-8 as the Braves fall 7-6 in a 17-inning game one loss in a doubleheader. Robin Roberts tossed all 17 innings for Philadelphia. \n1986 - Bob Horner hits his first career grand slam to help the Braves to a 4-2 win over the Pirates. Horner set a major league record by hitting 210 homers before connecting on his first grand slam. A record that would later be broken by Sammy Sosa. \n\n1998 - Andruw Jones hits his 50th career home run in a 4-0 win over the Mets. He becomes the third youngest player in major league history trailing only Mel Ott and Tony Conigliaro.

Ruth also had two hits in the win. \n1916 - Ty Cobb takes over in the 10th inning for the Tigers against St. Louis. Cobb beats out an infield single, then steals second and advances to third on a low throw. He holds at third as Bobby Veach grounds out sharply to first baseman George Sisler, but then runs for home and scores ahead of the throw as Sisler jogs over to touch the first base bag. Detroit wins 4-3. \n1945 - A’s catcher Greek George receives an indefinite suspension after punching umpire Joe Rue. George will not play in the majors again. \n1959 - The Dodgers set an attendance record when 39,432 fans show up for a doubleheader against the Cubs. Sandy Koufax sets a major league record with 41 strikeouts in his last three games, but loses the opener 3-0 as Ernie Banks connects for a three-run blast in the ninth inning. \n1976 - Dodgers catcher Steve Yeager is seriously injured when he is struck in the throat by the jagged end of a broken bat while he is in the on deck circle. \n1995 - Cal Ripken plays in his 2,131st consecutive game to break Lou Gehrig’s 56-year record. Ripken receives a 22-minute standing ovation from the Baltimore crowd in the fifth inning as the game becomes official. \n\n1996 - Eddie Murray becomes the 15th player in major league history to hit 500 home runs. He also joins Hank Aaron and Willie Mays as the only players in history to have 500 homers and 3,000 hits. \n\nInformation for this article was found via Baseball Reference, NationalPastime.com and Today in Baseball History.",

        "description": "On a recent late August day, buses filled with new students and incoming freshman arrived at John Marshall High School in Rochester for a three-day welcoming event — weeks before classes started. Activities included team-building exercises, a tour of the building and learning the school fight song. Even some upperclassmen joined in on the event, including student body president Manasa Yerriboyina.“COVID was hard for a lot of students and teachers because it really took a lot out of us,” she said as she passed out name tags to new students. “To get together brings us closer as a family and it motivates us at the end of the day to do what we&#x27;re here to do: be a family and learn.&quot;John Marshall High School student body president and senior Manasa Yerriboyina welcomes incoming freshmen during a pep rally at the school in Rochester, Minn., on Aug. 23.Elizabeth Nida Obert for MPR NewsCreating an early sense of connection is by design, one aimed at improving the mental health of students who&#x27;ve had a rough few years.The Rochester trend tracks with a statewide study conducted by the University of Minnesota, which found that by the start of the 2021 school year, more than 71 percent of teachers and half the students polled said they were worried about their mental well-being.Events at John Marshall are part of a broader districtwide strategy to limit defiance and disengagement among students in the coming school year — behaviors school officials say emerged in spades after students returned from pandemic-related distance learning. John Marshall High School principal Matt Ruzek welcomes incoming freshmen during a school orientation.Elizabeth Nida Obert for MPR News“I would say it was definitely predictable, but still very surprising,” said John Marshall Principal Matt Ruzek. “I&#x27;m reluctant to say we saw an increase in [bad] behavior, I think what we saw was just a cry for belonging and social connection.”‘Kids just weren’t going to class’School district data shows that while disciplinary infractions were on par with the school year leading up to the pandemic, staff reported more kids engaging in defiant behavior, and more often. A deeper dive into that data shows that students of all ages felt less connected to their schools — and less understood by their teachers.“I think it&#x27;s avoidance behavior,” said Chief of Schools Jacque Peterson, who’s been leading a districtwide effort to help create a sense of community in Rochester’s schools. She said for some students, virtual learning created an environment where they could turn their attention away from learning. When they headed back to in-person learning, some were behind on their learning.“I think it doesn&#x27;t take much to imagine, like, I&#x27;m sitting in a classroom and I have no idea what the teacher is talking about. It&#x27;s easier to just detach than it is to try to figure it out,” she said.John Marshall High School senior Ava Fevold, left, leads incoming freshmen on a school orientation. She pointed out the school office, where they would “have to go if they ever got in trouble,” and encouraged them to take as many Advanced Placement classes as possible.  Elizabeth Nida Obert for MPR NewsFor Angi McAndrews, principal of Kellogg Middle School, those behaviors were front and center when kids came back to in-person learning in the spring of 2021. &quot;We had definitely over the last year had more kids that were just refusing to go to class,” she said. &quot;It would be third hour, our hallways should be empty, kids should be learning and we just had kids that just weren&#x27;t going to class.&quot;McAndrews says the behaviors — and their frequency — were baffling and complex, emblematic of the mental health struggles so many kids faced during distance learning. She says COVID mitigation measures made school weird. Some students didn&#x27;t understand expectations after learning online for so long from home. Adding to the challenge: She and her staff hardly knew some of the students after a year of virtual learning.&quot;Trying to build the relationship at the same time as holding kids accountable for behavior is really super challenging, because we want to make sure that kids feel safe and connected and welcome,” she said. “But we also want to make sure that they&#x27;re here and that we&#x27;re there focusing on what we&#x27;re here for, which is education.&quot;John Marshall High School upper classmen greet incoming freshmen on Aug. 23.  “Welcome to JM!” they shouted before a pep rally in the gym and school orientation. Elizabeth Nida Obert for MPR News‘Has anyone asked the kids?’School district administrators were getting an ‘S.O.S’ from school leaders, said Will Ruffin II, equity and engagement director for Rochester Public Schools.&quot;We were in a cabinet meeting and then I said something like, ‘Has anyone asked the kids?’” he said.They hadn’t, so they did. Last school year, Ruffin organized nearly 40 listening sessions with students from across grade levels and demographic groups who had been disciplined about why they were engaging in inappropriate behavior.

For instance, Rochester students will see more school-based extracurriculars. A new cell phone policy sets clearer expectations around when they can be used in school. But as the fall approaches, Peterson said the focus is on building relationships so it’s easier for students to follow rules, and easier for staff to discipline them when they don&#x27;t. &quot;Until kids feel a sense of belonging, you&#x27;re not going to really see an impact on student achievement or really behavior,” she said. ",

Marlins Podcast Episodes\n\n\n\n\n\nAround Major League Baseball on Labor Day, old friend Lewis Brinson—now with the Giants—mashed his first MLB home run since leaving the Marlins, then added another for insurance in the ninth inning. He’s been leading off for them against left-handed pitching. Stone Garrett (Diamondbacks) stayed hot as well, upping his wRC+ to 245. Aaron Judge’s 54th homer of the season put the Yankees ahead for good in their win over the Twins. The Brewers rallied to win in Colorado, pulling to within two games of the Padres and Phillies in the National League Wild Card race. For the first time since 2006, the Astros’ all-time franchise winning percentage reached the .500 mark. Meanwhile, the Marlins won’t be celebrating the same milestone anytime soon.\nWe will have Alex Carr of Inside the Phillies on stream with us tonight from 5:30-6:30 p.m. ET for a new edition Fish Stripes LIVE.

As always, our Fish Picks props have been updated for the start of a new series.\n\n\n\n\nFanGraphs gives the Marlins a 34.8% chance to win their series opener against the Phillies.\n\nSandy Alcantara ranks No. 1, Pablo López ranks No. 31, Jesús Luzardo ranks No. 44, Edward Cabrera ranks No. 53 and Trevor Rogers ranks No. 73 on The List of top starting pitchers for fantasy baseball created by Nick Pollack of Pitcher List. At this stage of the season, projected remaining schedules are a major factor.\n\nSandy remains in control of the NL Cy Young award race, writes Ryan Finkelstein of Just Baseball, but Julio Urías has some momentum after moving ahead of him in earned run average.\nOnce Fish On The Farm reaches 7,000 followers on Twitter, they’re giving away an autographed Rogers card. Enter to win today!\nFalling roughly in line with conventional prospect evaluators, Baseball Trade Values ranks the Marlins farm system 14th in terms of total trade value.\nChristina De Nicola of MLB.com answered inbox questions from Marlins fans regarding impact players returning from injuries, the health statuses of Eury Pérez and Sixto Sánchez, and more.\nI put together a compilation of Zach McCambley curveballs from his two seasons with Double-A Pensacola. If you want to see more of these sort of videos, leave a like for it on YouTube and drop some suggestions for who I should do next.",

Meet the Mets\n\nThe Mets were off on Labor Day thanks to some inclement weather in Pittsburgh. They will make the game up against the Pirates in a split doubleheader on Wednesday, with the two games being played at 12:35PM and 6:35 PM.\nThe Mets will stick with the normal order of their rotation, meaning that Taijuan Walker will pitch today while Jacob deGrom and Chris Bassitt pitch in some yet-to-be-determined order on Wednesday.\nThe unexpected day off does come with some benefits for New York.\nThe team’s failed lineup upgrades could end up costing them the National League East crown.\nThe Mets fell two spots in MLB’s latest Power Rankings.\nJoon Lee examined how Edwin Díaz went from a big apple bust to the King of Queens.\nTim Britton dissected the worst series loss of the season, the struggling offense, and more in the latest edition of This Week in Mets.\nAround the National League East\nLeo Morgenstern pondered how the Phillies will survive without Nick Castellanos.\nThe surging Nationals topped the Cardinals 6-0 to extend their winning streak to three games.\nLuke Voit has embraced being a veteran leader in a young Nationals’ locker room.\nAround Major League Baseball\nThe MLB Draft lottery will reportedly take place during the Winter Meetings in San Diego later this year.\nAndrew Simon looked at which statistical races could go down to the wire.\nThe Red Sox and Kiké Hernandez have agreed to a one-year extension that will keep him in Boston through 2023.\nCould the Yankees’ recent slide cost Brian Cashman his job?\nAaron Judge is doing his best to save his team, hitting his 54th home run yesterday to guide New York past the Twins 5-2. The dinger died Alex Rodriguez for most by a Yankees’ right-handed hitter and puts him on pace for 65 on the season.\nThe Blue Jays swept a doubleheader from the Orioles with a 7-3 victory in Game 1 and a 8-4 victory in Game 2. Bo Bichette had a three-homer game, which made him and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. the first teammates to both have three-homer games in a season whose fathers played in MLB.\nThe Rays scored two in the seventh to beat the Red Sox 4-3.\nThe Brewers came back and won 6-4 against the Rockies.\nThe White Sox held off the Mariners 3-2.\nThe Diamondbacks blanked the Padres 5-0.\nThe Astros shut out the Texas Rangers 1-0.\nThe Guardians outlasted the Royals 6-5 in 10 innings.\nThe Angels pounded the Tigers 10-0, as Los Angeles superstars did most of the heavy lifting, Shohei Ohtani hit home runs number 31 and 32, while Mike Trout hit his 30th long ball of the season.\nYesterday at Amazin’ Avenue\nAllison McCague brought us the position player and pitcher meters for the week.\nI previewed the team’s three-game set in Pittsburgh, which was supposed to begin yesterday but instead will kick off tonight.\nOn Episode 186 of From Complex to Queens, the crew bemoaned the lack of impactful players who could be called up in the upper minor leagues.\nThis Date in Mets History\nOn this date in 2019, Edwin Díaz blew his seventh save of the season by surrendering a two-run home run to J.T. Realmuto, but the Mets walked it off in the ninth (literally) as Pete Alonso drew a bases on balls with the bases loaded to send the Mets home as winners against the Phillies.",

It is a clip of Harry Styles spitting at Chris Pine at the Don’t Worry Darling premiere.Anyone who has been keeping abreast of Don’t Worry Darling will know that it isn’t particularly good. The BBC called it “an empty shell”, The Daily Beast said that Harry Styles’s “bastardized British accent is a distraction” and Peter Bradshaw observed that the whole film is “a movie marooned in a desert of unoriginality”.

Those voters now want safer streets and a stronger border because they are worried for their families.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYou can’t scare people about COVID-19 or divide people on their vaccination status because most Americans have wisened up about the so-called experts’ failed promises and faulty data.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYou can’t really talk about gun control because Congress just passed a gun control bill, no matter how ineffective it was.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYou can talk about climate change, but few voters really care about climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYou can call the Republicans racist, but why would a racist political party work so hard to elect Black candidates like Herschel Walker in Georgia and John James in Michigan and a host of other rising stars?&nbsp;You can call the GOP homophobic, but then a&nbsp;significant chunk of House Republicans voted to codify gay marriage,&nbsp;and a significant chunk of Senate Republicans will likely follow suit in September.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNope, if you are Biden, you are kind of out of bullets.&nbsp;So, the only thing you can do is attack the Make America Great Again Republicans.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nClearly, divided government is the only way to plausibly heal the soul of the nation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMost voters think something is wrong with our democracy.&nbsp;Polling shows that Democrats, Republicans and independents are all concerned about the state of our government. As well they should be.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOur political system is a complete mess.&nbsp;The political class takes the wrong messages from the voters, and instead of working to solve problems, it goes out of its way to create new problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s not just the politicians. Even worse are the bureaucrats.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHealth bureaucrats completely botched our response to COVID-19, making claims that were provably false and promises that had no basis in fact.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPublic school bureaucrats took incompetence to a new level and mistreated our children, and now we have a real education and mental health crisis on our hands.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome in the intelligence community, which once was so good at undermining and overthrowing foreign governments it didn’t like, turned their attention to undermining and then overthrowing our elected leadership that it didn’t like.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNo wonder America is so divided and angry.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne-party rule has been bad for this country and bad for the soul of the nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe need more balance in our system — balance that will come from effective oversight hearings, fully-funded congressional investigations and a better accounting of taxpayer money.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration has done a lot of harm in the last two years, a lot more than many of us could have anticipated. I knew it was going to be bad; I didn’t think it would be this bad.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf you care about the soul of the nation, vote for divided government.&nbsp;Republicans might not be perfect, but somebody must stop this out-of-control president, who seemingly wants to demonize the half of the country that voted against him in 2020.\n\n\n\nFeehery&nbsp;is a partner at EFB Advocacy and blogs at thefeeherytheory.com.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3630080-liz-trusss-job-wont-be-easy-and-the-west-needs-her-to-succeed/",
        "description": "A principled, conservative stalwart, former Foreign Minister Liz Truss has won the leadership vote of the United Kingdom’s Conservative Party to become Britain’s 56th prime minister. A formidable politician, Truss is capable and dynamic, and embraced the sound economic policies that lifted her nation out of the miseries of its socialist hangover — the polar opposite of doddering, globalist President Biden. While her predecessor, Boris Johnson, accomplished the Herculean task of finally accomplishing Brexit, albeit with unresolved issues pertaining to Northern Ireland, Truss inherits a premiership fraught with challenges, foreign and domestic.\n\n\n\nSo, who is Liz Truss? The 47-year-old who was foreign minister in Johnson’s administration did not start out in life as a conservative. She grew up in a left-wing family, the daughter of a professor and a nurse, and cut her teeth on the ideological left, serving as student head of the Liberal Democrats student group at Oxford University, where she studied politics, philosophy and economics. Truss explains her political epiphany late in her studies at Oxford, where “she had met like-minded people who shared her commitment to ‘personal freedom, the ability to shape your own life and shape your own destiny.’”\n\n\n\nAfter working in the private sector, Truss won a seat in Parliament in 2010 with a committed philosophy of free market principles. Through a combination of excellent promotional skills, political acumen and effective career management, she not only survived but excelled in three changes of government. In 2012, she was named an education minister, and in 2014, was elevated to environment secretary, and then climbed higher to Justice Secretary and Chief Secretary to the Treasury.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJohnson appointed her to head the Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office, putting her in line for the top job upon his ouster. Queen Elizabeth will invite Truss today to form a government in her name.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Truss’s rise up the greasy pole may sound effortless, she capably managed opposition to emerge triumphant. She will need to deploy such skills to the geopolitical situation in which the UK now finds itself. Truss must address a dire inflation-triggered, cost-of-living crisis that is likely to lead to recession; surging energy prices; disruptive labor disputes; and some unresolved Brexit stalemates that continue to poison the waters with an intransigent, spiteful European Union.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSadly, Britain’s foreign policy challenges extend far beyond the EU, and thanks to the Biden administration’s policies and posturing, our strongest ally has no confidence that it can rely on American support. Consequently, Truss inherits a situation in which the time-tested “Special Relationship,” which has tended to stabilize markets and global conflicts, is severely taxed. While the U.S. and Britain are largely aligned on issues relating to Ukraine and NATO, the Biden administration has been a false friend and antagonist to the UK — most notably with respect to defense cooperation and support of its Brexit position.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s catastrophic troop withdrawal from Afghanistan without coordinating with our British defense partners — gifting control and an enormous weapons cache to the Taliban and sacrificing the lives of American service members — earned widespread, vocal scorn from our British fighting partners and, unprecedentedly, from the UK Parliament.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMoreover, in one of the most highly charged, unresolved issues of Britain’s leaving the EU, Biden chose to sell out our stalwart trading and intelligence partner, preferring instead to accept the bad-faith positioning of the EU with regard to the post-Brexit trading relationship involving Northern Ireland.\n\n\n\nThe West is severely imperiled at the moment, thanks in part to a lack of effective U.S. leadership. Biden’s instincts have inflamed the catastrophe. There is a legacy of Britain holding the U.S. to positions of resolve, as when Margaret Thatcher brought around George Bush Sr., warning him to not “go wobbly” regarding Saddam Hussein, with resolve that created a coalition to fight and win the first Gulf War. To that end, one would hope that Truss can have a positive influence on Biden’s errant foreign policy instincts. At best, perhaps she can coax the Biden administration toward better international policy.\n\n\n\nThe concept of the Special Relationship, as Winston Churchill baptized it, arose when Britain and America were on wartime footing. This partnership enabled the conquest of the darkest threats humanity faced. Not since those days has the West been as imperiled as it is at the moment, without such luminaries as Churchill, Thatcher and Ronald Reagan to guide it against aggression by Russia and China. Let’s hope that Britain’s new prime minister can play a constructive role to fill the leadership void.\n\n\n\nLee Cohen, a senior fellow of the Bow Group and the Bruges Group, was adviser on Great Britain to the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee and founded the Congressional United Kingdom Caucus.

        "description": "Director Jean Luc Herbulot dynamically weaves supernatural mystery into this gritty crime caper to produce a distinct and charismatic thrill rideA potent concoction of genres, Jean Luc Herbulot’s rule-bending film starts with a bang. In the first five minutes, we are plunged into a world of beauty and disorder. A young boy waddles into a mysterious river lit by both a sun and a moon; the scene quickly shifts to a rifle-toting gang of mercenaries charging towards a village hideout, a trail of dead bodies in their wake. Ostensibly set during the 2003 coup d’état in Guinea-Bissau, the opening suggests a more metaphysical leap, a realm where the supernatural and the criminal coexist.In fact, the gangster elements are satisfyingly gritty. Known as Bangui’s Hyenas, the mercenaries extract a drug dealer and his gold bullion from the rural chaos and make their escape on a plane. The whole endeavour is gorgeously choreographed with precise, dynamic camera movements; the adrenaline rush is cut short when the plane is shot down, leaving its passengers stranded near the Saloum Delta in Senegal. Here they encounter the suspiciously friendly Omar (Bruno Henry), who offers the men free accommodation in exchange for help with the eroding land. As folklore entwines with reality and secrets from the past emerge, it soon becomes clear that their arrival in Saloum is no coincidence, and demonic forces are closing in. Continue reading...",

        "link": "https://www.camdenchat.com/2022/9/6/23338698/orioles-analysis-anthony-santander-future",
        "description": "Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Once seen as future trade bait, the outfielder’s career year in 2022 has shown why he deserves a larger role in the Orioles’ future plans.  Most of Birdland thought they had Anthony Santander figured out coming into this season. He was a useful, switch-hitting corner outfielder who would give you decent power from both sides of the plate, but not much else. Sure, he went above and beyond his normal expectations in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. That was an anomaly though, a small sample size in circumstances that would never be replicated. At least that’s what we all thought. \nThen the 2022 season got underway and Santander, like the entire Orioles organization, has continually exceeded expectations. After another two home runs Monday against Toronto, Tony Taters stretched his home run total to 27—a team-high and career-best number. The six-year vet also leads these young Birds in RBIs, slugging%, OPS and extra-base hits. \nThe talk surrounding the Orioles lineup often centers around whether Cedric Mullins can get back the highs he displayed in 2021. Or around the mercurial nature of Ryan Mountcastle and Austin Hays’ production. Sometimes the talk ceases altogether and Birdland collectively just sits in awe of the wondrous displays by Adley Rutschman and (now) GUNNAR HENDERSON—though I can’t really blame anyone for that. \nHowever, while all of that has gone on around him, Santander has continued to be an offensive heartbeat for a group that has often collectively struggled to find its timing at the plate. In the 43 games since the All-Star break—a period where the Orioles’ offensive struggles have become more unnerving—Santander has gotten even better. Over that stretch, the O’s three-hole hitter has put up a .291/.348/.570 triple slash line, while picking up 22 XBHs and 31 RBIs. Those numbers stand out even more when compared to Mountcastle and Hays, who are hitting .187 and .203 respectively since the end of July. \nThe numbers put up by Santander don’t just beg the question of whether or not the UK’s favorite outfielder deserves more praise from Birdland. Earlier in the year, I viewed Santander’s long-term future with this franchise as being relatively short. At the big league level, Mullins and Hays had established themselves in a way that made it seem like they’d lock down CF and one of the corner OF spots for the next 5+ seasons. There was also the rise of prospects Kyle Stowers and Colton Cowser, and the looming presence of a Heston Kjerstad breakthrough and/or more outfield prospects coming from the draft. All of this combined to present a picture of an outfield depth chart becoming very crowded very soon. \nWhile there was never any doubt that Santander would stick on the Orioles roster through the 2022 season, he seemed like a prime candidate to be on the trade block come winter. It was easy to envision a scenario where he was the “major league ready” player in a trade that brought the Orioles an upgrade in their starting rotation or a more proven middle-of-the-lineup bat. Now, the question that surrounds Santander is whether or not he’s earned a more important long-term role with this franchise.\nSantander’s defense is the biggest detractor in the argument for inclusion in the Orioles' long-term plans. Simply put, he’s one of the worst defensive outfielders in all of MLB. Out of 135 qualified major league outfielders, Santander ranks 121st in Outs Above Average. His OAA numbers are particularly bad on plays where he has to go to his right—which, considering he mostly plays RF in Camden Yards, would be the majority of his opportunities. Speaking of fielding opportunities, he’s also the 8th worst OF in terms of converting opportunities into outs. \nThese numbers make it clear that, while Santander has hit well enough for the Orioles to keep in their lineup and their plans, his days as an everyday outfielder should be numbered. And that number should be small, very small. It has been reported that Santander has been working throughout the year to learn to play first base. While moving him to first certainly seems like a move that could limit his defensive downside, the fact that Santander has yet to play an inning at first stills leaves plenty of room for doubt. \nThe other problem presented by a potential move to first base for Santander is what to do with Ryan Mountcastle if you make that move. While Mountcastle has failed to improve upon his impressive rookie season, he still represents an important part of the Orioles lineup moving forward. Also, unlike Santander, Mountcastle has provided the O’s with plus defense, ranking in the 74th percentile for OAA among first basemen. \nWhile a platoon of the two at first base seems like a potential resolution, it’s not as simple as “Santander plays against righties, Mountcastle against lefties.” Throughout 2022, the two have similar batting average and slugging percentage against righties, while Santander has a clear advantage in OBP. Mountcastle is better against lefties, but Santander is one of the best hitters in baseball against southpaws. \nMany will question “why not just play Santander as the everyday DH?” While Santander will surely see more games at DH in 2023 than in 2022, this hardly feels like the perfect solution. The Orioles will undoubtedly want to keep the DH role open for Adley Rutschman on the days he doesn’t catch. It also wouldn’t be surprising for the Orioles to use the DH role to give ABs to prospects who may not be ready to contribute defensively but have a major league-caliber bat.  \nIn-depth self-scouting and a more nuanced approach to their lineup will be the Orioles' best way to keep Santander’s bat in the lineup without compromising their defense. Santander has proven a much better hitter than Mountcastle this year against fastballs, whereas Mountcastle gets the edge against breaking balls. It’s not hard to imagine a scenario where Brandon Hyde rolls out Santander at 1B against a flame-throwing starter, but has Mountcastle in there against more of a junkballer. It shouldn’t feel odd in 2023 if Santander has a series where he starts one game in the outfield, one at first, and the third at DH—depending on the pitchers the O’s are facing. \nLet’s make one last thing clear: the fact that the Orioles are faced with this dilemma of how to best utilize a good hitter is a great problem to have. Throughout 2022, Birdland has seen this franchise take players with untapped potential—Jorge Mateo, Felix Bautista, etc.—and provide them with the coaching and opportunities to allow them to shine. Santander is no different in this regard, as it’s clear he and this coaching staff have put in the hard work to make him a better player. \nSantander once seemed like a placeholder for prospects in the pipeline. Now, he has proven that he deserves consideration for a larger role in the grand designs of this rebuild. The way the Orioles provide him with that role is still uncertain. And yet, I for one cannot wait to see him continue to play his part in propelling this team to higher and higher heights.",

        "description": "While we&#8217;re firmly in Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro mode just weeks away from the full unveiling of Google&#8217;s upcoming flagship phones, in the tech world, we&#8217;re always talking about the next big thing.  Whether its folding phones, AR/VR, or a new take on mobile tech, we continue waiting for what&#8217;s next even when those things are quite a ways away.\n\n\n\nThat&#8217;s the case with the latest news out of Business Korea, claiming that Google is already at work on the next-gen Tensor SoC.  According to their report, the chip will be fabricated by Samsung on the company&#8217;s latest 3nm process that was just unveiled a few months ago.\n\n\n\nCompared to 5nm process, the first-generation 3nm process can reduce power consumption by up to 45%, improve performance by 23% and reduce area by 16% compared to 5nm, while the second-generation 3nm process is to reduce power consumption by up to 50%, improve performance by 30% and reduce area by 35%.Samsung News Room &#8211; June 30, 2022\n\n\n\nIn laymen&#8217;s terms, that simply means better battery life, more efficient operations, a smaller footprint, and better overall performance.  All sounds good, right?  It most definitely is, and if this report is accurate, it could mean we&#8217;ll see some pretty significant upgrades in the Pixel 8 (and presumably the Pixel 8 Pro) when they likely arrive next fall.\n\n\n\nUtilizing Samsung as the Tensor&#8217;s foundry isn&#8217;t odd as Google did the same with both the Tensor in the Pixel 6 and the upcoming Tensor 2 in the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro.  Again, if this report is to be believed, it appears that Google is taking aim at the most-powerful processors in the world with Tensor.  We&#8217;ve yet to see any ARM-based 3nm SoCs from any company at this point in an actual phone, but we&#8217;ll likely see it soon.  \n\n\n\nWith this move to a 3nm process, Google is clearly wanting to stay on the cutting edge of processor tech, and I love to see it.  The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro made big waves for Google in 2021 and 2022, but they can&#8217;t sit back and stop innovating.  Instead, they need to push the barriers, maximize performance, battery, and AI for future phones if they want to keep up this growth momentum in the hardware segment.  With this 3rd-gen Tensor, it sounds like they are doing just that.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "New research clarifies how gulls change the shape of their wings to control their response to gusts and other disturbances while in flight.\n&#8220;Birds easily perform challenging maneuvers and they&#8217;re adaptable, so what exactly about their flight is most useful to implement in future aircraft?&#8221; says Christina Harvey, assistant professor in the department of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of California, Davis and lead author of the paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n&#8220;Gulls are very common and easy to find, and they&#8217;re really impressive gliders,&#8221; she says.\nThree wind tunnel models of gull wings. (Credit: Christina Harvey/UC Davis)\nIn March this year, Harvey and colleagues at the University of Michigan published a paper in Nature analyzing the flight dynamics of 22 bird species. While previous studies have tended to focus on aerodynamics—how air moves around a bird—Harvey developed equations to describe birds&#8217; inertial properties, such as the center of gravity and the neutral point, where aerodynamic forces can be consistently modeled as point forces.\nAircraft are typically designed to be stable or unstable. A stable aircraft will tend to return back to steady flight when perturbed (for example, getting pushed up by a wind gust). This is desirable, for example, in an airliner, but not for a jet fighter. Highly maneuverable aircraft are designed to be unstable.\nIn their Nature paper, Harvey and colleagues show that almost all the bird species they studied are capable of both stable and unstable flight and use wing movements to shift between these modes.\nThe new study builds on this work, bringing together aerodynamic studies using 3D printed models of gulls and gull wings in a wind tunnel, with computer modeling of inertial forces to understand how gulls achieve stability along their long axis (falling or rising).\nGulls can adjust how they respond to perturbations in that axis by adjusting their wrist and elbow joints, and morphing the shape of the wings, they find. The team could predict the gulls&#8217; flying qualities and how rapidly they can recover from a perturbation like a gust. That reaction time also gives insights into the &#8220;controllable range&#8221; for the bird and into applying bird flight dynamics to aircraft.\n&#8220;The flight qualities analysis asks: if you built an aircraft exactly like a gull, would a human be able to fly it?&#8221; Harvey says.\nAs uncrewed aerial vehicles, or drones, become more widely used, they need to be able to navigate complex urban environments, something birds do very well. A deeper understanding of bird flight could help improve drone designs for various uses.\n&#8220;There are so many open questions about bird flight,&#8221; she says, &#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what else is out there to discover.&#8221;\nHarvey&#8217;s work has support from the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the National Science Foundation.\nSource: UC Davis\nThe post How gulls reshape wings to fly through wind gusts appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Billy Beane thwarted by Brad Radke &amp; Co. In the cultural cache, Major League Baseball’s analytical era was started by Billy Beane’s early-2000s Oakland Athletics. By prioritizing theretofore unheralded statistics like on-base percentage and walks, Beane was able to field a contending team on a shoe-string budget. A compelling movie—starring Brad Pitt, no less—all but cemented Beane’s legacy.\nYet, Twins fans—while perhaps not “bitter”—may view that narrative as revisionist. At the same time Beane was working his magic, Terry Ryan’s clubs had also created a small-market dynasty, of sorts, via shrewd trading and talent evaluation. On September 6, 2002, both franchises collided at the Metrodome in a contest few around to experience will ever forget.\n  \n        \n      Photo by Richard Orndorf/MLB via Getty Images\n      Dome Sweet Dome circa 2002\n  \nFrom August 13 to September 4 of ‘02, the A’s lined up and shook hands after the final out for a remarkable 20 consecutive games. Three of those victories came at the expense of our boys. It was the story of MLB—the A’s rising from their small-market, crummy-ballpark-by-the-Bay stature to become relevant again for that first time since the McGwire, Canseco, and Henderson days of yore.\nThat being said, the Twins weren’t slouching towards Fargo—or anywhere else, for that matter—in September of ‘02. Coming into the Labor Day weekend series with Oakland, they were 81-59—12.5 games in front of the nearest AL Central competitor—and closing in on an outright clinch. The atmosphere of 27,409 Dome-dwellers for the first game promised an electric, competitive series. It both was—and wasn’t—at the same time.\nThe Twins struck early in Game One, with first-inning doubles from Jacque Jones &amp; Corey Koskie. The bats would add on as the innings added up, with Koskie homering and Jones &amp; Cristian Guzman providing run-scoring hits. Green-and-yellow clad starter Cory Lidle (6.2 IP, 5 ER) didn’t have his best rotation turn.\n  \n        \n      Photo credit should read CRAIG LASSIG/AFP via Getty Images\n      Twins on the board early!\n  \nOf course, one would expect a team on a 20-game win streak to put up an offensive fight. But that wasn’t the case—not with Twins ace (this was pre-starting Johan) Brad Radke carving up Oakland’s not-inconsiderable batting order (Miguel Tejada, Eric Chavez, Jermaine Dye, etc.). When a final David Justice pop-up harmlessly nestled into Doug Mientkiewicz’s glove, Radke was still atop the bump—a 6 H, 5 K, 1 BB shutout and 6-0 victory! For the first time in 3 weeks, the A’s found themselves in the loss column.\nThe next two games of the series? Well, much like the musical Bruno, we don’t talk about them (consecutive A’s shutouts from Mark Mulder &amp; Barry Zito). But for that one evening, the Twins had proven they could stand toe-to-toe with baseball’s new phenomenon.\nAt the time, many mused that Twins/A’s could be a potential postseason pairing in a month’s time—exactly how things played out. But that’s a different story for a later date.\n  \n        \n      A sneak peak at a future article topic from yours truly",

        "description": "Director Jean Luc Herbulot dynamically weaves supernatural mystery into this gritty crime caper to produce a distinct and charismatic thrill rideA potent concoction of genres, Jean Luc Herbulot’s rule-bending film starts with a bang. In the first five minutes, we are plunged into a world of beauty and disorder. A young boy waddles into a mysterious river lit by both a sun and a moon; the scene quickly shifts to a rifle-toting gang of mercenaries charging towards a village hideout, a trail of dead bodies in their wake. Ostensibly set during the 2003 coup d’état in Guinea-Bissau, the opening suggests a more metaphysical leap, a realm where the supernatural and the criminal coexist.In fact, the gangster elements are satisfyingly gritty. Known as Bangui’s Hyenas, the mercenaries extract a drug dealer and his gold bullion from the rural chaos and make their escape on a plane. The whole endeavour is gorgeously choreographed with precise, dynamic camera movements; the adrenaline rush is cut short when the plane is shot down, leaving its passengers stranded near the Saloum Delta in Senegal. Here they encounter the suspiciously friendly Omar (Bruno Henry), who offers the men free accommodation in exchange for help with the eroding land. As folklore entwines with reality and secrets from the past emerge, it soon becomes clear that their arrival in Saloum is no coincidence, and demonic forces are closing in. Continue reading...",

Now, though, the time has come, once again, to gear up for the usual routine of online meetings, calls, and deadlines. The world, such as it is, continues to spin, no matter how we try to slow it down. So we are succumbing to reality and relying on a few cups of stimulation to cope. Our choice today is chocolate raspberry. Please feel free to join us. Meanwhile, here is the latest line up of items of interest. Hope your day goes well, and do keep in touch. We are always happy to make new pen pals. &#x2026;\nIllumina will have to divest Grail after the European Union vetoed the $7.1 billion acquisition over concerns it would hurt competition and stifle innovation, Reuters reports. The European Commission, which acts as the competition enforcer in the 27-country bloc, said that Illumina&#x2019;s remedies did not adequately address its concerns. Illumina completed the deal in August last year ahead of EU regulatory approval, resulting in an EU order to keep Grail separate and appoint independent managers to run the company until the investigation was concluded. Illumina said it would challenge the EU veto.Continue to STAT+ to read the full story&hellip;",

We all want to avoid turning on the oven or stove too often – to save both energy and time – so make dinner with one eye on tomorrow’s lunch. “Keep your lunchbox in mind at all times,” advises Georgia Levy, author of the recently published Let’s Do Lunch. “What can you do to your dinner to make it lunchbox-friendly?” Roast veg, for example, could reappear between two slices of bread with cheese, herbs and “something crunchy”, which could be anything from shredded carrots or cabbage (a quick slaw, say) to a handful of crisps.Got a culinary dilemma?

        "description": "Indulgent, yes – but this PS5 update reminds me what a heartbreaking gamechanger the horror classic really isDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? Sign up hereI’ve been playing The Last of Us Part 1 this week, a PlayStation 5 remake of Naughty Dog’s landmark horror classic, first released in 2013. (If you haven’t played it, or the 2020 sequel: I’ll be talking about them in some detail, so best to skip this section if you want to avoid spoilers.) There’s been a lot of justified grumbling about whether a nine-year-old game – which has already been remastered for the PlayStation 4 – can justifiably be sold again for £70; for most players, no graphics upgrade could ever be worth that much.People have praised Naughty Dog’s dedication and attention to detail on this remake. It really does look and feel like a modern game. Personally, playing it again has made me think about how the world (and my own life) have changed in the last decade. I wasn’t a parent when I first played those jaw-droppingly awful opening scenes, in which Joel’s young daughter dies in the first hours of the fungal zombie pandemic that devastates the world. Now, it is difficult to bear. And after having experienced a real pandemic, the whole setup hits differently. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Prospect news and statistics from the Rockies minor league affiliates from August 29-September 4, 2022 A week after the Arizona Complex League Rockies fell short in their championship aspirations, the DSL Rockies were still in the hunt for a short-season trophy of their own. After taking the first game from Boston Blue to end the week, the DSL squad made quick work of the Red Sox affiliate in game two to advance to the championship series against the Phillies White. They kept the winning-ways going with a 4-2 victory in game one, getting one step away from series victory. But the good times ended there, as the Phillies won games two and three to give the Rockies two runner-up finishes in the 2022 short-season leagues.\nOn the full season side, the end of August marked the rise of the Colorado Rockies’ 2021 first-round selection Benny Montgomery (No. 2 PuRP). Montgomery’s first full-season has been blemished by various nagging injuries, restricting Montgomery from showing his full potential for any substantial stretch. His expectations from the organization are still lofty, though, and last week he showed why with a 12-for-26 series against Modesto (SEA). Montgomery posted six extra-base hits (four doubles, a triple and a home run), drove-in eight runs, scored 10 and stole two bases in six games. Overall, Montgomery finished with a .462/.533/.808 line and a 21 total bases in what has easily been his most impressive performance this season.\nTop 30 PuRPs\nTriple-A: Albuquerque Isotopes (2-2, 58-68 overall)\nThe weather in Sugar Land (HOU) played havoc all week, limiting the Isotopes to just four games against the Space Cowboys. That may have been a blessing in disguise, as Albuquerque’s starting pitching had major difficulties getting outs. Logan Allen delivered a fine performance in his second start for the ‘Topes, allowing just two solo home runs over four innings. But Brandon Gold, Karl Kauffmann (No. 20 PuRP) and Zach Neal were not nearly as sharp. The trio combined to allow 20 runs (all earned), 22 hits and a strikeout-to-walk of 5-to-5 in just 8 ⅔ innings.\nAt the plate, Sam Hilliard and Wynton Bernard showed why they’ve earned big-league time this season. Hilliard hit two dingers and posted a .375 average and 1.349 OPS against Sugar Land while Bernard drew five walks, hit two doubles, scored five runs and swiped two bases on his way to a .417/.579/.583 line for the series. Coco Montes delivered a terrific week of his own, clubbing a double and two home runs.\nDouble-A: Hartford Yard Goats (4-2, 72-53 overall)\nBrenton Doyle (No. 10 PuRP) was a major contributor to Hartford’s home series victory against Reading (PHI). All told, Doyle led the Yard Goats in home runs (2), runs (6), hits (10), OBP (.458), SLG (.783) and total bases (18). Doyle’s OPS fell just short of team-leader Hunter Stovall, who finished with a 1.284 OPS in the series while tying Doyle with ten knocks. Julio Carreras (HM PuRP) continued to show he belongs in Double-A with three doubles while Daniel Montano finished with an impressive .333/.400/.500 line.\nOn the bump, Noah Davis (No. 19 PuRP) delivered an outstanding start, pitching seven innings with just one run allowed while striking out eight compared to just one walk. Will Ethridge also threw well, striking out eight with no walks issued over four innings pitched. Fineas Del Bonta-Smith was a workhorse in the bullpen, throwing four shutout innings in two appearances, allowing just two hits and one walk while registering six strikeouts.\nHigh-A: Spokane Indians (2-5, 62-62 overall)\nIt was a critical week for the Spokane Indians, matching up with the Vancouver Canadians (TOR) for seven games in six days with the playoffs on the line. Unfortunately, the Indians did not fare well, dropping five of the seven games at home and officially getting eliminated from the Northwest League playoff picture.\nWhile the outcome was not ideal, there were still good takeaways from the series. Chris McMahon (No. 9 PuRP) struck out seven while walking just one in six innings pitched. Mason Green also delivered a competitive start, allowing three runs over 5 ⅔ innings. At the plate, Mateo Gil continued his recent tear with a 7-for-24 performance including a home run. Since August 16th, Gil has posted an .884 OPS and 145 wRC+ in 77 plate appearances.\nBut the best performance came from Colin Simpson. Over 25 at-bats, Simpson had four extra-base hits (two leaving the yard) while leading the team in hits (10), runs (6), AVG (.400), OBP (.464), SLG (.760) and total bases (19). The Simpson show was so impressive that it earned him Player of the Week honors for the Northwest League.\n\n\n.@ColinSimpson30 has the juice.   pic.twitter.com/ygKglMzLbq— Spokane Indians (@spokaneindians) August 27, 2022\n\n\n\nFresno Grizzlies (4-1, 78-47 overall)\nRecent draft selections Jordan Beck and Sterlin Thompson made their Low-A debuts for the Fresno Grizzlies against the Nuts.

        "description": "Some people, perhaps most people, choose not to publicly share their health information. Perhaps I&#8217;m a fool, but I choose to do so — at least selectively. This is mainly because over the years I have been helped by people putting things online about themselves that I have subsequently recognised in myself.\n\n\n\nThis post is intended to use my own experience to be helpful to anyone else who might find themselves in a similar situation. A word of warning, though, I might be a &#8216;doctor&#8217;, but I am not a medical professional!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter I woke up on Friday, for a period of 5-10 minutes I had visual and auditory disturbances, a slight loss of balance, and co-ordination issues. These happened sequentially, followed by me feeling like I couldn&#8217;t get my words out and a slight slurring of speech. It was weird, but it passed.\n\n\n\nThe next day, I had a headache. It was persistent enough for me to take one of my migraine tablets (Rizatriptan). In the afternoon I felt well enough to do some sprinting in an attempt to improve a Strava segment personal best. On Sunday I felt fine and went for a longer run. \n\n\n\nFamily and friends insisted, quite rightly, that I should get checked out. I saw the doctor on Monday and he suspected I may have had a Transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or &#8216;mini-stroke&#8217;. He checked me over, took bloods (which came back fine) and referred me to the stroke clinic. The NHS is awesome, particularly in Northumberland.\n\n\n\nToday is Tuesday and I&#8217;ve been to the stroke clinic who have assessed me. I wasn&#8217;t allowed to drive myself there, or indeed at all until they gave me the all clear. Thankfully, they&#8217;re pretty certain it wasn&#8217;t a TIA as what I describe came in a &#8216;wave&#8217; rather than all at once. It&#8217;s almost definitely just my pattern of migraine symptoms changing as I get older — but they&#8217;re giving me a non-emergency MRI scan in the next couple of weeks just to double-check.\n\n\n\nAlthough I (probably) didn&#8217;t have one, if you&#8217;re reading this and recognise something similar has happened to you, then get checked out! As the Wikipedia page for TIAs states:\n\n\n\nThe occurrence of a TIA is a risk factor for having a major stroke, and many people with TIA have a major stroke within 48 hours of the TIA. All forms of stroke are associated with increased risk of death or disability. Recognition that a TIA has occurred is an opportunity to start treatment, including medications and lifestyle changes, to prevent future strokes.\n\n\n\nI&#8217;m really pleased it was &#8216;only&#8217; a migraine-related issue that I had on Friday, but I was stupid to wait more than 48 hours to follow up on it. Again, if you&#8217;re reading this because you had a &#8216;funny turn&#8217;, go and seek some medical attention.\n\n\n\nLife is short. It&#8217;s easy to get into a good routine and feel pretty invincible. But this was a reminder that we should all count our blessings.The post Migraines and TIAs first appeared on Open Thinkering.",

        "description": "Photo by Mitchell Layton/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Yankees’ remedy for losing has arrived, and they needed it with the field keeping pace. The Yankees got a decent jolt in their system when the Twins arrived in town. Only a power such as the one the Yankees have over the Twins could conjure a scenario where Marwin Gonzalez and Isiah Kiner-Falefa homer in the same game. Oh, Aaron Judge did as well, but that’s nothing new. Anyway, the Yankees won the first game of their homestand, setting them up to gain ground if any of their rivals stumbled. Let’s check in on how they did:\n\nTampa Bay Rays 4 (75-58), Boston Red Sox 3 (67-69)\n\nThe Red Sox are the only AL East team out of the race at this point, and their best hope for the rest of the season is to play spoiler down the stretch. They had a chance here against Tampa Bay, which would have been very beneficial to the Yankees after the series they just dropped to the Rays. Boston held a 3-1 lead after the third inning, but Tampa cut the deficit to one in the fifth inning. Michael Wacha left the game after the sixth, turning the ball over to Jeurys Familia who promptly blew it by allowing RBI doubles to Manuel Margot and David Peralta. Colin Poche and Peter Fairbanks held the Sox in check for the final two frames to seal the deal.\n\nToronto Blue Jays 7 (74-59), Baltimore Orioles 3 (71-63)\n\nToronto and Baltimore got together for a doubleheader in Camden that had major implications for the Wild Card race. If either team got the better of the other it would be a sizeable shift in the standings, and Toronto won out here. Kevin Gausman pitched 6.2 innings of two-run ball, with his only mistake coming against Anthony Santander in the first inning. The Blue Jays scored three over the next four innings to bail him out of that early hole, added another in the eighth, and put the game away with three runs in the ninth.\nToronto Blue Jays 8 (75-59), Baltimore Orioles 4 (71-64)\nThat led us into the second game of the doubleheader, where the O’s again took an early 1-0 lead, this time up against José Berríos. However, the main character of this outing was Bo Bichette, who launched not one, not two, but three long balls in this game. Bichette’s first came in the third inning and was a three-run shot, and he paired it with solo blasts in the sixth and seventh innings. Bichette got an at-bat in the ninth inning looking to join the elusive four-homer club, but he lined out instead. \n\n\nTHREE HOME RUNS FOR BO BICHETTE  (via @MLB)pic.twitter.com/EivLxMAEEL— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) September 5, 2022\n\n\n\nThe doubleheader sweep at home was a tough blow for Baltimore fans, who saw their team fall 4.5 games behind Toronto in the Wild Card race.\n\nHouston Astros 1 (87-48), Texas Rangers 0 (58-76)\n\nThe Rangers held onto Martín Pérez over the trade deadline, keeping him around to pitch amazingly in games like these ... and still lose. Pérez was masterful against an elite Houston lineup, tossing seven innings and allowing just one run, way back in the second inning when Martin Maldonado hit a two-out single to score Trey Mancini. The Rangers, meanwhile, were three-hit by Hunter Brown and the Astros ‘pen, completely failing to provide a pulse when their ace was shoving.\n\nChicago White Sox 3 (68-67), Seattle Mariners 2 (76-59)\n\nLance Lynn was on top of his game for the White Sox, striking out 11 over seven innings and allowing just an unearned run in the second. Chicago had gotten on the board first a half inning prior on an AJ Pollock solo shot, and they rebounded immediately with two runs in the third thanks to an Elvis Andrus blast. Seattle was held in check until the ninth inning when they started a rally off of Liam Hendriks, but they couldn’t get the tying run across.\nOther Contenders\n\nCleveland Guardians 6 (69-64), Kansas City Royals 5 (55-81): Cleveland won this one in extras on a two-run double from Oscar Gonzalez, breaking through after three Royals relievers had stifled their offense temporarily. The Guardians have the Yankees to thank for giving them the lead in the AL Central lead again, in a race that will surely eek its way to the end of the year. (They’re one up on Cleveland and two ahead of Chicago.)",

        "description": "Voter engagement organization Vote.org is launching a $10 million campaign to boost young voter turnout ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n\n\nThe campaign effort, called Vote Ready, seeks to reach out to 4 million voters ages 18 to 30 and register more than 1 million young Americans by Nov. 8, according to a press release to be published later Tuesday.\n\n\n\nVote.org will use social media and other online resources to inform people how to register, fill out an absentee ballot or navigate election laws ahead of election day.\n\n\n\nVote Ready builds on a previous announcement from the organization to register more than 1 million young Americans for the 2022 midterm elections. \n\n\n\nBoosting young Americans in elections is a key goal for Vote.org. Gen Z is the third-largest generation alive, with 17 million youth becoming 18 in time for this election.\n\n\n\nVote.org CEO Andrea Hailey said, \"younger voters have the power to shape their future but successfully navigating elections can be a barrier to making their voices heard.\"\n\n\n\n\"The first two times someone votes are the most important elections to ensure that voting becomes a lifelong practice,\" Hailey said in a statement. \"Fundamentally, that must start with educating young people on the power of having their voices heard and represented, making clear the cause and effect of being civically engaged on a national level and in their communities.”\n\n\n\nThe midterm elections are set to be a tight race between Democrats and Republicans for control of Congress, which could shape the congressional agenda for the next two years. \n\n\n\nIn 2020, Gen Z came out in record numbers during a high-stakes presidential election, but it's unclear if that will be matched for a midterm election in 2022, which historically see less turnout.\n\n\n\nAn April Harvard Institute of Politics poll shows youth turnout is on track to match a record youth turnout for a midterm election in 2018, but 42 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds also said they don't feel like their vote matters and expressed other discontentment with the political system.\n\n\n\nThe elections also come amid a number of hot-button issues that younger voters are passionate about, including climate change and LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n\n\nJack Knoxville, the founder and executive director of the Trans Empowerment Project, said his organization is working with Vote Ready to empower his community in the November elections.\n\n\n\n\"The disenfranchisement that many of us feel is by design – there are some who do not want us to vote,\" Knoxville said. \"That very fact should be clear evidence as to how powerful your voice really is.\"\n\n\n\nVote.org led its largest ever voter turnout drive in 2020, registering more than 4 million voters that year.\n\n\n\nThis year, Vote.org is concentrating its efforts on boosting young voter turnout in Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, Colorado, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Florida, Nevada and Pennsylvania, which the organization estimates to be \"key states pivotal to increasing youth turnout.\"\n\n\n\nVote Ready is partnering with the NAACP, Taylor Swift, the NBA, Sony Music Group, The CW, Meta and OkCupid to engage youth this year.\n\n\n\nThe CW CEO Mark Pedowitz said in a statement his television network was honored to partner with Vote.org.\n\n\n\n\"We will be working with Vote.org to create and share new content with our audience so they can make their voices heard, this election cycle and beyond,\" Pedowitz said.",

        "description": "Paul Rutherford-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Red Sox are on the upswing after winning five of seven this week. Here’s the Week In Review. It’s Week-In-Review time! Here’s what was happening in Red Sox Nation, 8/29/22 - 9/4/22. \nRecord\n5-2\nThe Sox are hot! They dropped their first two games on Monday and Tuesday to the Twins but responded by rattling off five straight against those same Twins and the Texas Rangers. 67-68 with 27 games left. 23-4 the rest of the way gets you to 90 wins. Why not us? \nRun Differential\n+5\nBoston is on the upswing, their run differential reflects as much and, if not for a 10-run evening from the Twins on Tuesday, it would look even better. The Red Sox scored five or more runs in all seven games they played last week \n\nPlayer of the Week \nXander Bogaerts was a menace all week long for the Twins and Rangers. He entered Sunday’s game with a .536/.563/.786 slash line and a .813 win probability added for the week. That’s before he went 3-4 with a run scored and two RBI in the series finale against Texas. Xander finished the week 18-31 (.580) with five doubles, a homer, 10 RBI, eight runs scored and three walks to just three strikeouts. \nSomeone’s going to pay him a lot of money to play baseball and I think it should continue to be the Red Sox.\nI want to honorably mention Kaleb Ort here for his 4.2 innings of scoreless relief this past week. Good week, just not good enough to overshadow the monster one that Xander had. \n\nPlay of the Week\nConnor Wong has been up and down the Red Sox system over the past two years and had been serviceable through limited action. But Christian Vazquez is no longer in the picture and Wong, one of this season’s September call-ups, will probably have plenty of opportunities to audition for the 2023 team a little early. \nHe took a step in the right direction on Friday by slamming his first career home run in a 9-1 win over the Rangers. \n\n\nConnor Wong's 1st career home run was DESTROYED. pic.twitter.com/6OhDzrQhLK— Red Sox (@RedSox) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nNemesis of the Week\nIt was a good week for the Sox so picking this one is hard, but we’ll give the nod to Gio Urshela — a former Yankee that went 4-10 with three RBIs and a walk and three games this week as his Twins took two of three from the Sox. \nFavorite Red Sox Content\nJonathan Papelbon hung out with the Savannah Bananas this week and is making Tik Toks! Check back next week when, lord willing, Jonny Damon is doing the same. \n\n\nI had so much fun with @TheSavBananas I even made a damn TikTok video. First one ever! I think the next dude to go to Savannah needs to be @JohnnyDamon, it’d be epic! pic.twitter.com/1ryFnjb9FA— Jonathan Papelbon (@TheRealJPap58) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nBold Prediction for Next Week\nI think Brayan Bello comes through with another big night in his next time out. Talking 6+ innings, no runs, 7+ strikeouts and less than a couple of walks. I think he’ll ride a hot streak through the middle innings and hand off a clean slate to the bullpen. Can’t say I have any other reasoning than I just love his stuff and think he’s going to be a big part of this franchise’s rotation for a while. He’s never gone more than six innings in the big leagues and I think that changes this week. \nFavorite Thing I Ate While Watching/Listening to a Game\nIf you’re ever in Pittsburgh, I’d encourage you to visit Benny Fierro’s in the Southside for a very large slice of very good pizza. I enjoyed one while watching the Red Sox win on Sunday afternoon. \n  \n        \n  \nLooking Forward\nThe Red Sox kick off a stretch of eight straight against division opponents with three-game sets on the road against the Rays and Orioles. They’ll be back home for two games against the Yankees after that. \nThis Week in Red Sox History\nOn September 1, 1939, the Red Sox traded future Hall of Famer Pee Wee Reese to the Brooklyn Dodgers for $35,000 and two players to be named later. Reese went on to play in 10 All-Star games over his 18-year career for the dynastic Brooklyn Dodgers, who won seven National League Pennants during his tenure and won the 1955 World Series. \nReese’s finest moment came off the field, however. He was an active supporter of Jackie Robinson, who was breaking into the Major Leagues while Reese was the Dodgers’ star shortstop. He refused to sign a petition created by his teammates that protested Robinson’s promotion and when asked if he was afraid of Robinson taking his position said “If he can take my job, he’s entitled to it”.\nYou can read more about “baseball’s finest moment” between Reese and Robinson in this fine column by Bob Herbert from 2005.  \nThe Red Sox lost a really good player and better person that day.",

Kiké Hernandez signed a deal to spend one more year in Fenway. Now the only question is whether he can bounce back from something of a lost season. (Alex Speier, Boston Globe)\nThis is Triston Casas’s first taste of the big leagues, but not his first time hitting at The Trop. And, according to Kevin Cash, anyway, he hit some of the longest home runs anyone’s ever seen down there - when he was still in high school. (Jen McCaffrey, The Athletic)\nBoy, all these people who keep running to Twitter to tell everyone that Xander is having a bad year are sure going to be surprised when he ends up winning a batting title. (Chris Cotillo, MassLive)\nThis has been Rob Refsynder’s best MLB season. According to him, it’s not random, but the product of a change in approach. (David Laurila, FanGraphs)\nSo apparently Nelly frequently shows up at Mookie’s new house in LA at two in the morning.  Maybe if some of Boston’s biggest celebrities had done the same thing, he’d still be playing in Fenway right now. Come on, Lenny Clarke, you should’ve been on top of that. (John Healy, WEEI)",

        "description": "9:05am: The Cubs have now formally announced this set of moves, further specifying that Steele&#8217;s injury is a lower back strain. His placement on the 15-day IL is retroactive to Sept. 2, per the team.\n8:12am: The Cubs are set to select the contract of pitching prospect Hayden Wesneski for his Major League debut, per the team&#8217;s transactions log at MLB.com. Righty Kervin Castro is being designated for assignment in order to open a spot on the 40-man roster. Left-hander Justin Steele, meanwhile, will be placed on the 15-day injured list. Steve Greenberg of the Chicago Sun-Times tweeted yesterday that Steele&#8217;s next start &#8212; which had been scheduled for today &#8212; was being pushed to the weekend due to a nagging back injury. Now, it seems the Cubs will now give him at least a two-week break to heal up.\nWesneski, 24, was acquired from the Yankees in the one-for-one trade that sent righty Scott Effross to New York prior to the trade deadline. He currently ranks sixth among Cubs farmhands at Baseball America, 12th at MLB.com and 16th at FanGraphs.\nThe 6&#8217;3&#8243;, 210-pound Wesneski has appeared in five games in the Cubs organization, all coming with Triple-A Iowa. He&#8217;s posted an ugly 5.66 ERA in that time, although that&#8217;s due primarily to a disastrous eight-run clunker through just 1 2/3 innings in his organizational debut. Wesneski has bounced back with a 2.37 ERA and 21-to-6 K/BB ratio over his next four appearances (three starts, one relief outing, 19 total innings).\nWesneski has spent the entire season at the Triple-A level despite this just being his second full season after being drafted in the sixth round back in 2019. (There was, of course, no minor league season in 2020.) He&#8217;s turned in a 3.92 ERA with a 23.2% strikeout rate, a 7.9% walk rate and a  42.7% ground-ball rate. Wesneski works primarily off a two-seamer and a lesser-used four-seamer (the latter reaching the upper 90s on occasion), complementing those two heaters with a trio of offspeed offerings, all with at least average potential.\nEven at the time of the deal, Wesneski was touted as a quick-rising, near-MLB-ready arm that could find his way into the Cubs&#8217; rotation in the very near future. Whether this will just prove to be a spot start or the first step in a more permanent audition remains to be seen, but Wesneski figures to get legitimate chance to crack the rotation next spring, even if this is just a one-off promotion born out of necessity. The scouting reports at BA, MLB.com and FanGraphs all tab him as likely fourth/fifth starter. He&#8217;ll be controllable through at least the 2028 season.\nAs for the 23-year-old Castro, he was a waiver claim out of the Giants organization in early August who wound up throwing 10 2/3 innings out of the Chicago bullpen. Castro&#8217;s 92.7 mph average fastball was down nearly two miles per hour from his 2021 velocity, and he&#8217;s had considerable issues throwing strikes both in the big leagues and in Triple-A this season (with both the Giants and Cubs). He&#8217;s been tagged for 14 runs in 12 1/3 MLB frames this year (10.22 ERA) and also has a 5.19 ERA in Triple-A. He&#8217;s walked 15.1% of his opponents between Triple-A and the Majors this year. The Cubs will place Castro on waivers or release him within a week&#8217;s time.",

        "description": "Nathan J. Fish/The Oklahoman / USA TODAY NETWORK\n    \n\n  Minor league seasons are coming to a gradual close, including just one more week for both Class-A levels. Double-A schedules run for two more weeks, through September 18, while Triple-A plays through September 28. Two Dodgers affiliates have already qualified for the playoffs, with another one currently in first place.\nTriple-A Oklahoma City\nUnlike the other full-season levels, Triple-A isn’t split into halves. It’s a year-long battle. Oklahoma City lost four straight to Round Rock (a Rangers affiliate) last week, but Sunday’s win kept OKC two games up on Round Rock in the East Division of the Pacific Coast League. \nOKC still has 3½ weeks and 21 games left on the schedule, including nine games at home, with a regular season schedule that ends on Wednesday, September 28. Oklahoma City won the season series over Round Rock, 16-14.\nThe two PCL division winners — Reno, a D-backs affiliate, is nine games up in the West — will play a one-game playoff on Friday, September 30 to determine the PCL champ. The winners of the PCL and International League will play for one game on Sunday, October 2 to decide the overall Triple-A champ.\nDouble-A Tulsa\nThe Drillers have struggled in the second half and still have two series remaining, but they already clinched a playoff berth thanks to a 40-27 first half to win the Texas North Division.\n\n\nWe love this team, #DrillVille    @dannebraden pic.twitter.com/ssRVvk3ei3— Tulsa Drillers (@TulsaDrillers) June 25, 2022\n\n\n\nDouble-A and both Class-A levels have the same postseason format. The division winners play a best-of-3 series to determine the division champions from September 20-23, followed by a best-of-3 championship round.\nHigh-A Great Lakes\nThe Loons won the Midwest League East Division in the first half, and are already playoff bound. They will face the second-half winner — either Lake County (Guardians) or West Michigan (Tigers) — in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\n\nHard to believe what happened with this team over the last two weeks...         DAY: 36-15GL: 28-24 (8.5 gms back)            GL: 12-1 (best in MiLB by 2 gms)DAY: 3-11 (3rd worst in MiLB)Yes, Dayton floundered. But these Loons also went &amp; f'ing took it! pic.twitter.com/Tv61K52HHK— Brad Tunney (@brad_tunney) June 23, 2022\n\n\n\nJust like in Double-A, there will be a best-of-3 series for the division — for the Loons, that’s September 13-16 — followed by a best-of-3 series for the league championship.\nLow-A Rancho Cucamonga\nLake Elsinore (Padres) won the South Division in the first half, earning them a berth into the California League playoffs. In the second half, the Quakes trail the Inland Empire 66ers (Angels) by five games with just six to play, for the right to play Lake Elsinore. Those long-shot odds were exacerbated when Rancho Cucamonga just lost four of six to Inland Empire in San Bernardino, though they staved off elimination with a one-run win on Sunday night.\nThe Quakes play at home against Lake Elsinore this week, while the 66ers are at Visalia. Rancho Cucamonga’s elimination number is two.",

Like, literally, had never had a grape. I remember the first time I had a grape, I went, ‘Wow! This is quite tasty.’ It was absolutely ingrained so deeply in me: Never cross a picket line.&#8221;\nNot surprisingly, the New York Post is trying to turn the story into &#8220;grape-gate&#8221; by questioning her dates.",

        "description": "FiveThirtyEight: &#8220;There are a lot of election deniers on the ballot. Out of 529 total Republican nominees running for office, we found 195 who fully denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election. These candidates either clearly stated that the election was stolen from Trump or took legal action to overturn the results, such as voting not to certify election results or joining lawsuits that sought to overturn the election.&#8221;\n&#8220;Moreover, an additional 61 candidates raised questions around the results of the 2020 election. These candidates haven’t gone so far as to say explicitly that the election was stolen or take legal action to overturn it. However, they haven’t said the election was legitimate either. In fact, they have raised doubts about potential fraud.&#8221;",

        "description": "A superlative 1977 season with the Mets was but a footnote in Randle’s fascinating baseball life Welcome to UnforMETable, an Amazin’ Avenue Audio show that looks back on less heralded, more obscure Mets players from the team past. \nOnce described by the MLB Network as baseball’s Forrest Gump, Lenny Randle did have an uncanny knack for appearing at randomly notable baseball moments—including two of the five contests to end in forfeit since 1971.\nRandle was a seeming fixture with the Texas Rangers until the loss of his job—and an ensuing confrontation with his manager—led to his suspension and subsequent trade to the Mets in 1977. With New York, Randle would have a superlative season in a year that would be difficult for the franchise—and the city—as Randle would be standing at home plate when Shea Stadium—and NYC—were plunged into a famous blackout. \nAs always, you can listen or subscribe to this and all of our wonderful Amazin’ Avenue Audio podcasts through Apple Podcasts, where we encourage you to leave a review if you enjoy the show. It really helps! And you can find us on the Stitcher app, or listen wherever you get podcasts.\n\nIf you’ve got an idea for a player to be featured on UnforMETable, let us know in the comments.\nMake sure to follow Rob on Twitter (@WolffRR), and you can now follow the show, too (@unformetable). Tune in next week for another tale from the Mets’ past.",

        "description": "She writes rap lyrics on vintage lingerie and paints gynaecological instruments bubblegum pink. Now, for her first UK show, the Brooklyn-based British artist is tackling the mental, physical and financial fallout from a miscarriageZoë Buckman’s uterus has been doing the rounds on social media. The Brooklyn-based artist made the kinetic sculpture, which comprises a neon outline of an abstracted reproductive organ with fibreglass boxing gloves as ovaries, in the run-up to the 2016 US election, amid conversations about contraception, abortion and rape. Six years later, with abortion no longer protected under the constitution, the work is sadly just as relevant. “I appreciate anyone who shares it because it was intended to be a piece about resilience and resistance that united us,” says Buckman. “But for me, it’s become something that’s associated with bad news. I see that someone’s posted it and I think, ‘Oh God, what’s happened now?’”Buckman, who was born in east London in 1985 and moved to New York to study photography in 2008, has made a name for herself creating art about the female experience. Spanning embroidery, sculpture, poetry, photography and film, her work – with echoes of Louise Bourgeois, Judy Chicago and Tracey Emin – explores sex, trauma and violence from both a personal and a social perspective. “I’m pretty certain I wouldn’t be where I’m at in my career if I weren’t in New York,” she says. “And one reason is because I don’t think I’d be having the same response to the work if I weren’t living among this shit. The UK is fucked, but not nearly as fucked as America. My friends in the UK have the right to sexual healthcare and they have support. In the US, choice is reserved for the elite and the blessed.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "The slugger turned down a huge contract extension from the Yankees and bet on his own abilities. It looks like he made the right decisionAaron Judge started 2022 by turning down a seven-year, $213.5m contract extension from the New York Yankees. That deal would have given the now 30-year-old one of the largest contracts in MLB history. But Judge thought he was worth more, opting to play out this season and see what he could fetch in free-agency. In an era in which the phrase “bet on yourself” has become ubiquitous, perhaps nobody placed a larger bet than Judge. And that bet is paying dividends.On Monday against the Minnesota Twins, Judge launched his 54th home run of the season, the latest installment in a special campaign from the 6ft 7in, 280lb right fielder. Judge’s effort puts him on track to finish the season with 64 home runs, which would take him past the American League record of 61, set by fellow Yankee Roger Maris in 1961. Beyond that is MLB-record territory, where the murky, steroid-bound legacies of Barry Bonds (73 home runs in 2001), Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa (70 and 66 respectively in 1998) are the subject of endless fan debate.

        "description": "Russia’s Ministry of Defense is purchasing millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea to bolster its forces in Moscow’s war in Ukraine, according to a U.S. official. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe official told The Hill that the assessment, which is based on downgraded U.S. intelligence, is a sign of Moscow suffering from “severe” military supply shortages driven in part by export controls and economic sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.S. anticipates Russia purchasing more North Korean military equipment in the future, the official said, without providing additional details on what type of equipment. The New York Times was first to report on intelligence suggesting Moscow was buying North Korean equipment. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRussia has also turned to Iran to bolster its weapons stockpile. Biden administration officials said in late August that Tehran had transported its first shipment of Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series drones to Russia for use on the battlefield in Ukraine but cited information suggesting they have experienced mechanical failures. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to deepen relations with North Korea, which is isolated due to international sanctions over its nuclear program, since Moscow invaded Ukraine. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe United Nations currently bars Pyongyang from importing or exporting arms from or to other countries, meaning that the sale of rockets and artillery shells to Russia would violate that arms embargo.\n\n\n\nUkraine, meanwhile, has relied on billions of dollars in equipment from the U.S. and other nations to supplement its own military as it fights back against the Russian onslaught. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRussia’s military campaign against Ukraine has stretched more than six months and shown no signs of winding down. Russia fell well below expectations in its military strength, failing to achieve its initial goal of capturing Kyiv. &nbsp;",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/3630437-preserving-the-rule-of-law-successful-law-enforcement-has-a-domino-effect/",
        "description": "Need evidence that successful law enforcement actions in cases involving the rule of law can have a domino effect?\n\n\n\nExhibit A: On Sept. 3, we learned that former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows had recently coughed up texts and emails that he had previously failed to produce to the National Archives. “It could be a coincidence,” an unnamed source told CNN, “but within a week of the Aug. 8 search on Mar-a-Lago, much more started coming in.”\n\n\n\nThe court-approved search of former president Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence occurred after Trump had failed to comply voluntarily with multiple government requests to return all documents, including classified ones. The search warrant listed three criminal statutes that Trump may have violated. Anyone paying attention could see that Trump had put himself in danger of being prosecuted.\n\n\n\nMeadows was apparently paying attention.\n\n\n\nExhibit B: No Jan. 6 participant whom the DOJ has charged has gone to trial since May 2. That’s likely the domino effect of a jury’s guilty verdict against Thomas Webster — a Marine Corps veteran and former NYC policeman — that day and two other similar verdicts in the weeks before.\n\n\n\nThe jury took less than four hours to convict Webster, as did the juries that rendered guilty verdicts against Gary Reffitt and Dustin Byron Thompson.\n\n\n\nSince then, no one else involved in Jan. 6 has tested their luck with a jury. That doesn’t mean there won’t be future trials, but it suggests that swift justice in a courtroom has an impact on others. They learn the lesson: When the evidence is strong against you, juries don’t waste a lot of time convicting you. So you might as well get the benefit of a guilty plea.\n\n\n\nExhibit C: And if others had any doubt, Webster’s and Reffitt’s sentencings likely dispelled it. On Aug. 2, Reffitt was sentenced to more than seven years in prison. At the time, that was the longest term of imprisonment any judge had meted out for being part of the insurrection. Then, on Sept. 1, Webster received a 10-year sentence. (Thompson, the other insurrectionist who went to trial, remains to be sentenced.)\n\n\n\nWhile every accused person has a right to a trial, our judicial system deploys carrots and sticks. It encourages those against whom the evidence of guilt is compelling to acknowledge their wrongdoing, and it penalizes those who don’t.\n\n\n\nSo do not expect to see many future trials of the Reffitt and Webster variety. Effective law enforcement by good investigators, prosecutors, judges and juries has a compounding effect.\n\n\n\nFinally, here’s Exhibit D: Smart law enforcement actions can domino into unsmart defendant reactions.\n\n\n\nAfter the FBI released the photo of top secret documents placed on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago office carpet, Trump posted a response on social media: “The FBI took them out of cartons and spread them around on the carpet, making it look like a big ‘find’ for them,” he asserted. “They dropped them, not me — Very deceiving.”\n\n\n\nTrump was again playing his “aggrieved martyr” card to his base — but in the process, he added to prosecutors’ portfolio against him. His own words confirm that he held sensitive national security documents at Mar-a-Lago — in “cartons,” in his desk and elsewhere.\n\n\n\nTake note: What a subject of investigation doesn’t say when he talks can be as important as what he does say. Prosecutors will note the absence of any assertion that the FBI “planted” the evidence, as Trump had previously suggested. So there goes that defense if Trump tries to make it at a future trial.\n\n\n\nTrump may not understand that when a Justice Department he doesn’t control is breathing down his neck, he’s in a different world from the one he’s known. It’s not smart to play the same old cards. The ones that worked on social media won’t have the same effect in a courtroom.\n\n\n\nPolitical narratives are not what count with the FBI, with prosecutors and judges or with juries. What matters is how the facts fit into the criminal code. And what you say in public “can and will be used against you.”\n\n\n\nDennis Aftergut is a former federal prosecutor, currently of counsel to Lawyers Defending American Democracy.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/twins-to-select-louie-varland.html",
        "description": "The Twins are calling up one of the top pitching prospects in their system, as they&#8217;ll select the contract of right-hander Louie Varland to make his big league debut Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium, per Patrick Reusse of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune (Twitter link).\nVarland&#8217;s call to the Majors continues a nice development story for a North St. Paul native who&#8217;ll now suit up for his hometown club. He&#8217;s one of just four players ever to be drafted out of Division-II Concordia University in St. Paul &#8212; older brother Gus Varland, currently in the Dodgers&#8217; system, is another &#8212; and the Twins grabbed him well down the board, in the 15th round. (The Varland brothers, just one year apart in age, faced off against one another earlier this season, when both started the same game for their respective teams&#8217; Double-A affiliates.) The younger Varland pitched just 8 2/3 innings in the Twins organization in 2019 after being drafted and didn&#8217;t pitch in 2020, when there was no minor league season.\nA D-II 15th-round pick with 8 2/3 professional innings (all coming in Rookie ball) obviously isn&#8217;t going to carry much prospect fanfare, but Varland erupted with a 2021 breakout that saw him named the Twins organization&#8217;s minor league pitcher of the year. Beginning the season in Class-A Fort Myers, Varland came roaring out of the gates with a 2.09 ERA and a massive 38% strikeout rate before being promoted to High-A Cedar Rapids, where he largely repeated that success. In 55 2/3 frames with the Kernels, he posted a 2.10 ERA with a 29.9% strikeout rate. Varland walked just 7.1% of his opponents between the two levels, and by the conclusion of the &#8217;21 season, he featured prominently among Twins prospect rankings.\nIt&#8217;s been more of the same for Varland in 2022 &#8212; this time between Double-A (105 innings, 3.34 ERA, 26.4% strikeout rate) and Triple-A (21 1/3 innings, 1.69 ERA, 32.1% strikeout rate). The right-hander explained to FanGraphs&#8217; David Laurila this time last year that despite throwing just 90-92 mph during his college days, he&#8217;s now sitting 94-95 mph and peaking in the upper 90s after working with the Twins&#8217; development staff.\n&#8220;I would put it to our pitching coordinators and the pitching coaches with my teams,&#8221; Varland told Laurila. &#8220;But also Martijn [Verhoeven], our [motion performance] coach. He really cleaned up my mechanics so that I could pitch with an efficient arm path. That was really the root of it all; everything has stemmed from that.&#8221;\nThe results speak for themselves, as Varland has ascended from obscurity to the Major Leagues in short order &#8212; and with a career 2.61 ERA, 30% strikeout rate and 7.6% walk rate in the minor leagues. MLB.com ranks him 10th among Twins prospects, while Baseball America has him listed 16th and FanGraphs at No. 25. Varland complements a high-spin four-seamer that now draws plus grades with a trio of offspeed offerings: a changeup, a slider and a seldom-used curveball. Both the changeup and slider have potential to be above-average pitches, per that group of scouting reports, with MLB.com suggesting the changeup is already there. He&#8217;ll be controllable through at least the 2028 season.\nOnce he&#8217;s formally selected to the roster &#8212; which may not happen until tomorrow, if he is indeed slated for a Wednesday debut &#8212; Varland will immediately join the Twins&#8217; rotation mix for the remainder of the season and for the 2023 campaign as well. He&#8217;ll have a full slate of three minor league option years, meaning he could be moved up and down on an as-needed basis for awhile he doesn&#8217;t immediately seize a starting job. And, with the reworked arm slot and mechanics unlocking some additional velocity, it remains possible that Varland could eventually end up a hard-throwing bullpen piece, should a role in the rotation not pan out.",

        "description": "Photo by G Fiume/Getty Images\n    \n\n  One of the Orioles September call-ups is an MLB veteran who only arrived in the organization a week ago. Over the offseason, Camden Chat published an article about each member of the Orioles 40-man roster. During the 2022 season, we will update on new arrivals after they make it to the roster.\nHow he arrived: Minor league contract signing 8/31/22, contract selected 9/1/22\nWho left: Richie Martin designated for assignment 9/1/22\nThrough this ongoing 40-man roster series, there is one question I always try to answer about each player: Why is this guy here on the Orioles now? For some players, like the last one before this, the answer is obvious. Many others have taken some squinting. Jesús Aguilar is one of the ones where you have to squint pretty hard to try to figure out a reason that makes some kind of sense.\nThe newest Oriole, Aguilar, is not someone who anyone would have thought of a couple of weeks ago for the simple reason that he wasn’t here. The 32-year-old was with the Marlins through August 28, when he was released after having been designated for assignment two days earlier. No team wanted to claim him on waivers and be on the hook for the final month of his $7.5 million salary this season. \nThe Orioles will only owe Aguilar the pro-rated portion of the MLB minimum. This is about as low-cost as moves get. The only opportunity cost is that someone had to be removed from the 40-man roster. No one outside of Richie Martin’s circle of family and friends can be too upset about his getting dropped. \nPrior to 2022, when the current MLB CBA set a limit on the number of pitchers who can be active on the roster at one time, Aguilar’s spot might have gone to a reliever. The O’s could only add one pitcher when the rosters expanded by two on Sept. 1, and that was DL Hall.\nPlayers who have been doing well do not get designated for assignment. This is obvious, and it’s really obvious when you look at Aguilar’s 2022 batting performance. Across 113 games for Miami, he batted .236/.286/.388. The Orioles already have a right-handed hitting first baseman with a sub-.300 OBP whose value, such as it is, is derived largely from how many home runs he hits, and he isn’t hitting an impressive number of homers this year. That’s Ryan Mountcastle.  Do they really need another? \nMountcastle, at least, is at 1.0 bWAR for the season. Aguilar has a WAR whose absolute value is 1.0. Unfortunately for him, there’s a negative in front of it.\nWhat Aguilar does have going for him is a track record of decent performance up until this season. From his first full season in MLB in 2017 through to last year, Aguilar batted a combined .263/.338/.476, with a home run every 18.5 at-bats. That’s a 114 OPS+ over five years, which is better than every Orioles batter has done in 2022 except for Anthony Santander and Adley Rutschman. Over those five seasons, Aguilar added value at 2.0 WAR per 650 PA. You can find room for that player even if he’s redundant to someone on the current roster.\nNone of that good stuff is evident in how Aguilar has performed this season, though. A cursory glance at his Statcast percentages shows a lot of bad ones. He is not making the kind of contact where you might expect a good batting average or slugging percentage. He isn’t really hitting the ball hard at all. He is swinging and missing a lot, and especially chasing pitches outside of the strike zone too much. That’s added up to walking much less and striking out more.\nIf the Orioles are going to do something to reverse that trend, they don’t have much time to pull this off. The season is down to its final month. They are in the postseason chase with ground to make up, especially after the disastrous Labor Day doubleheader. There’s no reason to wait around for some guy who might be in “stick a fork in him, he’s done” territory to see if maybe he has something left in the tank.\nAguilar has not exactly done anything over his first handful of Orioles games to suggest he’s got a big turnaround from his Marlins numbers coming. It’s not like he’s been a sparsely used clubhouse mascot, either. He started three games since arriving on Thursday. \nLike Brett Phillips a month ago, it is simply not clear to me what he brings to this team that wasn’t already here. The Phillips experiment lasted less than three weeks. Maybe Aguilar will surprise us all and do something to deserve a roster spot from now until October 5, or maybe he won’t and the Orioles will keep him that long anyway.\nStill to come: Anthony Castro, Jake Reed",

        "description": "Scientists have conducted an in-depth genetic analysis of whipworm eggs from 2,500-year-old Viking feces.\nThe study, which appears in Nature Communications, presents new knowledge about the parasite&#8217;s development and prehistoric dispersal. This knowledge could be useful in preventing the parasite&#8217;s drug resistance and future spread.\nThe study suggests that humans and the parasite (Trichuris trichiura) have developed a delicate interaction over thousands of years, whereby the parasite tries to stay &#8220;under the radar&#8221; not to be repelled, which gives it more time to infect new people. Other studies show that the whipworm stimulates the human immune system and the gut microbiome, to the mutual benefit of both host and parasite.\nWorms are transmitted via the fecal-oral route, meaning that microscopic parasite eggs in soil can spread to drinking water or food.\n&#8220;During the Viking Age and well into the Middle Ages, one didn&#8217;t have very sanitary conditions or well-separated cooking and toilet facilities. This allowed the whipworm far better opportunities to spread,&#8221; says professor Christian Kapel of the University of Copenhagen&#8217;s department of plant and environmental sciences.\nWhile whipworm is now rare in industrialized countries, and most often only causes minor problems among healthy individuals, the parasite is estimated to affect 500 million people in developing countries.\n&#8220;In people who are malnourished or have impaired immune systems, whipworm can lead to serious illness. Our mapping of the whipworm and its genetic development makes it easier to design more effective anti-worm drugs that can be used to prevent the spread of this parasite in the world&#8217;s poorest regions,&#8221; says Kapel.\nEggs, not worms, made it possible for researchers to examine the genetic material of thousands-of-years-old whipworms. Due to extremely durable chitin in egg capsules, their internal DNA has been well preserved while the eggs have been buried in moist soil.\nBy examining fossilized stool samples which were previously discovered in the latrines of Viking settlements in Viborg and Copenhagen, the researchers isolated the eggs under a microscope, sieved them from the stool, and subjected them to refined genetic analyses that the researchers have been perfecting for years in previous studies.\n&#8220;We have known for a long time that we could detect parasite eggs up to 9,000 years old under a microscope. Lucky for us, the eggs are designed to survive in soil for long periods of time. Under optimal conditions, even the parasite&#8217;s genetic material can be preserved extremely well. And some of the oldest eggs that we&#8217;ve extracted some DNA from are 5,000 years old. It has been quite surprising to fully map the genome of 1,000-year-old well-preserved whipworm eggs in this new study,&#8221; explains Kapel.\nThe researchers examined archaeological stool samples from several locations. They compared the ancient genetic samples with contemporary samples from people with whipworms from around the world. Doing so has provided researchers with an overview of the worm&#8217;s genome and its evolution over tens of thousands of years.\n&#8220;Unsurprisingly, we can see that the whipworm appears to have spread from Africa to the rest of the world along with humans about 55,000 years ago, following the so-called &#8216;out of Africa&#8217; hypothesis on human migration,&#8221; explains Kapel.\nResearchers from the Wellcome Sanger Institute in the UK collaborated on the study.\nSource: University of Copenhagen\nThe post Eggs in Viking poop reveal whipworm genetics appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "There’s literally no pictures of Louis Varland in our files. Sorry. | Photo by David Berding/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The youngster will begin his major-league journey at Yankee Stadium. The Minnesota Twins are digging deep into the depths of their starting pitching rotation once again. With Tyler Mahle hitting the injured list once again, the club needed a starter this week against the New York Yankees in New York and they’ve reportedly decided on their guy.\n\n\nLouie Varland’s first big-league start will be Wed. night in Yankee Stadium.Go, North St. Paul.— Reusse (@Patrick_Reusse) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nRight-hander Louis Varland will be making his major-league debut tomorrow at Yankee Stadium, according to Patrick Reusse of the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Aaron Gleeman of The Athletic also picked up on the rumor and confirmed it this morning. Gleeman notes that this will be the first time in Twins history that a starting pitcher will make his debut at Yankee Stadium. What could go wrong, right?\nThe St Paul native started off his 2021 campaign with Class A Fort Myers, posting a 2.09 ERA/2.66 RA9 in eight starts and 47.1 innings of work. A very impressive 14.5 K/9 and K/BB ratio of 4.75 got him a promotion to High-A Cedar Rapids in the middle of July where he continued on with similar-ish numbers: 2.10 ERA/2.26 RA9, 10.7 K/9, 4.71 K/BB ratio, 0.988 WHIP. He was then awarded another promotion to Class AA Wichita to start this season. The trend continued with a slightly higher 3.34 ERA/3.94 RA9 in 19 starts and 105 innings logged with a 10.2 K/9 and a 3.05 K/BB, which led to him moving up to Class AAA St Paul almost a month ago. In four starts there (21.1 innings), he’s posted a 11.4 K/9 - 27 strikeouts against only three walks - and a WHIP of 0.844. The Twins are certainly hoping that this trend continues for the 24-year-old during his cup of coffee in the majors. \nAccording to his review on the MLB Prospect Rankings for the organization, where he’s ranked tenth, Varland can touch 98 MPH with this fastball. He’ll offer a changeup as his secondary pitch and can also throw a slider in the mid-80s. He already has a trophy to his name, earning the Twins’ Minor League Pitcher of the Year honors for 2021. \nSonny Gray was moved to start on Thursday against the Evil Empire to allow him an extra day after leaving his last start with a sore hamstring, opening up the starting spot for tomorrow’s contest. The Twins will need to make a 40-man roster move in addition to clearing a player off of the active roster. Minnesota could roll the dice again on designating Aaron Sanchez for assignment and hope he could clear waivers, which could be the most likely move.",

        "description": "Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Catching up on the Dodgers after Labor Day weekend On Tuesday morning’s Leading Off with True Blue LA podcast, we take stock of Dodgers news over the long Labor Day weekend, and a few recent trends.\nAndrew Heaney keeps giving up home runs, ten of them over his last four starts, including four in a loss to the Giants on Monday. What that means going forward remains to be seen.\nOn the injury front, Gavin Lux got a cortisone shot in his neck and is expected to miss some time, though not on the injured list. Tony Gonsolin and Brusdar Graterol got relatively good MRI news, and are both throwing again. So is Yency Almonte, though none are on rehab assignments yet. Tommy Kahnle, Victor González, and Danny Duffy are in Oklahoma City, which makes the next two weeks or so the likely time for several pitching decisions.\nAlso on this podcast, I lament the recent explosion of position players pitching, taking away the fun from what used to be a rare event. But I do appreciate that Hanser Alberto, in setting a record for position players with eight pitching appearances this season, has pitched in seven wins. That’s at least different from the norm, and fun in his own way.\n\nPodcast links\nWays to listen\nRSS feed\nEpisode link (time: 20:11)",

        "description": "This failure is a blow and a thorny path lies ahead, but the will to replace Pinochet’s hated constitution remains strongI confess that I am in mourning. On Sunday, a resounding 62% of the voters in Chile, my country, rejected the adoption of a new and progressive Magna Carta; leaving in place, for now, the fraudulent constitution imposed by dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1980 that has acted as a straitjacket to indispensable reforms.Like many of my compatriots I believed that the new constitution, born in response to a popular revolt three years ago, would be ratified. It was the most ecologically advanced such founding document in world history, granting personhood to nature, protecting rivers and air and forests. It extended democracy, established gender parity and popular participation, granted Indigenous peoples the recognition they had been denied for centuries, lovingly answered the need for universal health care, decent education and pension funds, access to water, sovereignty over mineral resources, the care for animals and children – things that generations of Chileans have been fighting for.Ariel Dorfman is a Chilean-American writer and the author of Death and the Maiden, The Compensation Bureau and Voices from the Other Side of Death Continue reading...",

        "description": "Minda Haas Kuhlmann\n    \n\n  This Week in the Minors: Beck Way’s 8 no-hit innings; Columbia’s race for first is down to the wire; Hicklen chasing milestones ‘This Week in the Minors’ is our weekly look at notable performances from all over the system, from big-name prospects and less-heralded guys alike. The mission is to answer this simple question: “Who had a good week?”\nThis Week in the Minors: Tuesday, August 30 to Sunday, September 4.\nAAA Omaha Storm Chasers (61-67)\nschedule | roster\nThe Storm Chasers were on the road to play the St. Paul Saints (MIN), and split the series 3-3. The Triple-A season goes through September 28, leaving Omaha with 22 games remaining.\nLefty Marcelo Martinez struck out nine in his Wednesday start, and that tally tied a season high. One unearned run scored in six innings, and Martinez walked just two.\nRHP Yefri Del Rosario was among some promotions to Omaha this week, and one of his two outings was a sparkling two inning appearance with no hits and just one walk allowed. Patrick Halligan, also a righty, debuted in Triple-A with 2 1⁄3 IP, three strikeouts, and just one hit allowed.\nÁndres Núñez is back on his shutout stuff again, currently sporting a 13-inning shutout streak across his last 10 games.\nOutfielder Dairon Blanco hit well in the series, going 9-for-21 with two doubles, a triple, and two homers. In a result totally out of character for Blanco this year, he was 0-2 in stolen base attempts. Those were just the 5th and 6th times he had been caught all season, with a team-leading 34 steals.\nSpeaking of steals, Brewer Hicklen stole two more this week to reach 30 on the season. He also homered twice to get to 27 in that column, and if we want to do a lot of dreaming toward milestones, we could note that he has 22 doubles as well.\nLogan Porter went 7-for-14 and drew seven walks, and was plunked once, for a series OBP of .682. Catcher Freddy Fermin collected six hits this week, starting September with some of the same heat he carried throughout August.\nIn part time action, Gabriel Cancel hit two dongs and two doubles as part of a 5-for-12 effort. Edward Olivares is rehabbing with Omaha, and also went 5-for-12. Big O hit two doubles. \nAA Northwest Arkansas Naturals (53-72 overall; 22-35 in second half)\nschedule | roster\nLike Omaha, the Naturals split their series at Tulsa. They have two series remaining in their season.\nOutfielder Tyler Gentry led the way on offense, with nine hits that included three doubles and a homer. Gentry had a phenomenal August, slashing .317/.468/.500 over the course of the month.\n\n\nTYLER GENTRY FOR THE LEAD  Tulsa issued an intentional walk to get to @TylerGentry15 and he makes them pay with a three-run homer to put the Naturals ahead  ▲ 9 | #NWANaturals 8 Drillers 5  https://t.co/tNFNvhdFZW pic.twitter.com/sVzsDje0v2— Northwest Arkansas Naturals (@nwanaturals) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nFellow outfielder Tucker Bradley homered in each of the first three games of the series, part of a 7-for-18 series during which he also drew six walks and stole three bases.\nAdv-A Quad Cities River Bandits (51-75 overall; 25-35 in second half)\nschedule | roster\nThe River Bandits went on the road to play the Beloit Sky Carp (MIA), and split the series 3-3. The playoffs are not in the picture for QC, and they will wrap up their season with a home series against Peoria. \nThe biggest story on the pitching front this week was Beck Way’s incredible start on Saturday, in which the righty struck out 10 batters in eight no-hit innings. Baserunners did reach by way of four walks and two hit by pitches, but they did no damage. The effort was good for a game score of 88, per Baseball Reference. Way, who just turned 23 a month ago, was part of the return for Andrew Benintendi, who just went on the injured list with the Yankees. \n\n\nRoyals traded Benintendi to NYY for No. 11 prospect Beck Way in July Tonight, Way struck out career-high 10 in 8 no-hit innings in High-A   pic.twitter.com/tvup0u9Iyp— Farm To Fame (@FarmToFame_) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nAt the plate, CF/2B Peyton Wilson had another good week, going 8-for-22 with a double and a homer, and three stolen bases. Also clocking in with eight hits was 2B/3B Herard Gonzalez, who hit his 9th homer of the year in Tuesday’s win.\n\n\nPeyton Wilson hit his 11th home run of the season earlier today. pic.twitter.com/QQSMmEuw2G— Royals Farm Report (@RoyalsFarm) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nCatcher Jack Alexander went 5-for-12 with a double an-d a home run. Center fielder Parker Bates homered twice and stole three bases in his three games.\nFor the first time, Tyler Tolbert’s illustrious stolen base streak seemed to be in jeopardy as he was thrown out on the bases. However, it was scored a pickoff rather than a caught stealing, and Tolbert stole three more bases to give him 59 on the season with a 100% success rate. \nSingle-A Columbia Fireflies (51-74 overall; 33-26 in second half)\nschedule | roster\nThe Fireflies split a series with the Carolina Mudcats (MIL), and trails the first-place Charleston RiverDogs by four games. There is one series remaining in the regular season and GUESS WHO COLUMBIA’S OPPONENT IS! It’s Charleston! \nRight-hander Jonatan Bernal got the week started right for Columbia by pitching seven shutout innings on Tuesday, allowing just three hits. 50 of his 69 pitches were strikes, and the outing was the longest of his pro career. Bernal, who just turned 20 at the end of June, was the return in the trade that sent lefty Foster Griffin to the Blue Jays.\nFrank Mozzicato was next on the bump for the Fireflies, and he started Wednesday’s game with five solid innings. He allowed one run on six hits and a walk, and struck out a season-high eight batters. The 94 pitches he threw were also a season high. \nLefty reliever Marlin Willis is on a roll lately, with 10 shutout innings spread across his last six appearances. In that span, he has struck out 17, walked seven, and allowed fur hits.\nRight-hander Mason Barnett made his pro debut this week, tossing two hitless innings in relief. Barnett, 21, was drafted in the 3rd round out of Auburn this summer.\nThe Firelflies had a ton of productive hitters this week, including left fielder Javier Vaz and his 11 hits. In addition to the hits, Vaz drew eight walks and struck out only twice.\nFirst baseman Guillermo Quintana also hit in the double-digits, with 10 hits that included foru doubles. Quintana only struck out once, and walked three times in 29 plate appearances in the series.\nAcross the diamond, third baseman Cayden Wallace wen 9-for-22 with three doubles and a triple, plus four walks and only one strikeout. Wallace also stole three bases in three tries. \n\n\nGreat swing and an opposite-field double for Gavin Cross. pic.twitter.com/YZHG4QQEqU— Royals Farm Report (@RoyalsFarm) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nCenter fielder Gavin Cross, the Royals’ top draft pick this summer, also had a phenomenal week. Cross went 8-for-18 with a double and a homer, stole two bases, and drew eight walks. His OBP for the series was .615. \nAnd one more Gavin Cross highlight, just because:\n\n\nGAVIN CROSS. GRAND SLAM. 8-0 FLIES. pic.twitter.com/o6TdpDiLtl— Royals Farm Report (@RoyalsFarm) August 31, 2022\n\n\n\n\nUp for discussio﻿n: What late-season promotions have surprised you? Who would you like to see get a little more playing time as we approach the end for some levels? How closely will you be following the Columbia-Charleston series?",

        "description": "Sign up for Kaitlyn and Lizzie’s newsletter here.Kaitlyn: Watergate … it caused the events of Nora Ephron’s Heartburn, if you think about it.Also, she went around telling everyone who “Deep Throat” was, but they just assumed she wouldn’t know and therefore didn’t believe her. (It’s no wonder she hated D.C.) Something that really sticks with me about the movie version of All the President’s Men is that The Washington Post didn’t let them film in the real office, but they did have reporters save all their trash for a while and then gave the trash to production so that they could sprinkle it around the set. (Really generous.) And something that sticks with me about the book version of All the President’s Men is that it is very dry and confusing—not well-written at all. You can actually skip it, but you can’t skip Heartburn.Anyway, the reason I’m talking about this: Our friend Andrew has spent something like a year working on a Watergate-themed episode of his amazing podcast, Aw, Would You Look at the Time. His attention to detail is legendary. He watched dozens of hours of the hearings, as well as every fictionalized version of the scandal that he could find, including the off-Broadway play Trial on the Potomac, which starred a famous Nixon impressionist and posited that the real Nixon was innocent—railroaded! You can’t skip Heartburn and you can’t skip Aw, Would You Look at the Time Episode 12, “The Many Voices of Richard Nixon.”You already missed the party in celebration of this episode’s release and the 50th anniversary of the Watergate break-in, but we’ll tell you about it.Lizzie: I had been hearing rumors of this party for months. Anticipation was high! “I wonder if Andrew is going to have his Watergate party this weekend,” we wondered, every weekend. “Andrew has to have his Watergate party soon,” we agreed. We were, of course, very eager to attend and would remind Andrew of this anytime we saw him.We were eager for a few reasons:\r\n\t\r\n\tThis newsletter, which requires us to schedule our social lives around its needs.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThe theme, which promised intrigue, deception, and wiretapping.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tAndrew’s reputation for paying meticulous attention to detail, which Kaitlyn has already mentioned. If anyone could pull off a historically accurate and curiosity-filled Watergate party, it was Andrew.\r\n\t\r\nWhen the invite finally arrived, with promises of “an immersive experience of a 1970s living room,” “a showing of the Watergate hearings,” and “Watergate: The Board Game!” we were ready.[Read: At a sausage party in New Jersey]Kaitlyn: The invite also promised the opportunity to “meet an investigative reporter!” When I inquired about this, Andrew said he just assumed that one would show up.Before the party, I ordered The Watergate Cookbook from 1973 off of eBay and then spent days trying to decide what to make. The recipes really had no thematic relevance to Watergate, and the titles weren’t even puns, for the most part—just regular recipes with the names of various Watergate personalities tacked onto them (e.g., “Krogh’s Savory Cheese Puffs,” “Agnew’s Stuffed Ham Helpers”). I chose “Gurney’s Grapefruit Pie,” which was basically a grapefruit-flavored gel topped with baked meringue. Then I improvised a second pie with a layer of vanilla pudding and a layer of Cool Whip mixed with blue Jell-O.It was 90 degrees out, and I was worried about the stability of the various complex molecular structures we were carting across town, so I called a car to get us to Andrew’s apartment in Flatbush. Stopped at a red light on Nostrand Avenue, we watched as the car in front of us pulled into the intersection and did two full donuts, creating an enormous cloud of street dirt and exhaust. You don’t see that every day!Lizzie: I couldn’t figure out what to bring to the party that felt appropriate for the era. It felt disgusting to bring something like deviled eggs or a nut-covered cheese ball onto the subway. Kait texted me photos of recipes from her Watergate cookbook for inspiration. The complete lack of imagery in these recipes made it difficult to figure out what exactly I would end up with if I followed their directions. I’m familiar with the concept of a torte, and I know that ambrosia is basically just sweet stuff in a bowl, but what do Kissinger’s Snow White Capers look like? Actual capers, but white? Cottage cheese? (This will come up later).I’ll admit, I was worried about making something that would need to be wholesale trashed once no one at the party ate any of it. Ultimately, it didn’t matter, as things often don’t, because what I ended up making (pineapple upside-down cake) was horrible. I kept hoping I might drop the cake on my way to Andrew’s apartment, but no such luck.\r\n\"Watergate salad\" and other era-appropriate desserts. (Courtesy of Lizzie Plaugic)\r\nKaitlyn: I love pineapple upside-down cake and was very happy to see Lizzie’s. I don’t know what she thought was wrong with it.In Andrew’s living room, a selection of the Watergate hearings was playing on one television, while a fictional film about Nixon was playing on another. Andrew offered us the opportunity to record ourselves on a tape recorder resembling the one Nixon had used in the Oval Office, so I pulled up my favorite Nixon quote and whispered it into the mic. When Nathan remarked that it didn’t seem like this recorder was exactly the right model, Andrew said, “Well, just you wait!” and then retrieved the exact right model—a Sony TC-800B—from elsewhere in his apartment. I don’t know why he hadn’t set that one out in the first place and can only imagine he was waiting for someone to critique the anachronism, allowing him to surprise and delight them by erasing it before their eyes. I asked Mariya if there was a Nixon quote she wanted to record, and she was like, “Well, no. Didn’t he say he hated Black people?” (Maybe not in so many words, but yes, basically.)At this point, I told Andrew that I had brought a small voice recorder to the party in order to tape all of my conversations, but that I would have to reveal it to each guest individually for reasons of journalistic ethics. He said that he was also recording, but as “a social experiment.” After one Heineken, I offered to take everyone on a field trip to the Atlantic office in Washington, D.C., which is located in the Watergate complex, but we didn’t have enough cars.Lizzie: New York State only requires one-party consent when it comes to recording people, so I think you’re both legally in the clear. Still, knowing that my every word was being recorded by multiple people at this party was a little unsettling. I abstained from the Campari and OJs, drinking only my nonalcoholic leisure soda to keep my wits about me.The thing is, any person who spends time around me and Kaitlyn at any event documented in this newsletter is being recorded —it’s just usually typed into our Notes app. During this party, I wrote down that someone said, “The world is so vast” and “People don’t read unless they’re interested in the life of the mind.”I also wrote down, “Kaitlyn doesn’t understand cell division.” That’s not a direct quote—just an observation.[Read: We finally learn to shuck oysters]Kaitlyn: Yeah … and I bet Lizzie understands it really well …You may be noticing an odd, hostile tone to this week’s newsletter. This is for good reason. Like Nixon, I spent much of Saturday’s party in a paranoid state, perceiving persecution and animosity all around me. And like Nixon, I wasn’t entirely wrong. For example, Nathan told everyone about the weird argument we had the night before we moved in together. I had started it by saying that my college cell-biology class was so complicated and difficult to understand that it made me believe in divine creation. Nathan really loves science, so this had been startling and upsetting to him. He’d felt it was dishonest of me to conceal this feeling until mere hours before we were to enter a serious commitment involving paperwork and a lot of money. As he recounted this in the conversation circle, I put my hands up and tried to defend myself. First of all, I know that evolution is real. But, as they tell you in Sunday school, the seven days it took God to create the world, in God time, could have been billions of years. Also, I’d had such a frustrating experience sitting in that library all night trying to memorize the chemical process of caffeine entering the bloodstream—there are like 14 steps!“Yeah, there are a lot of steps,” Lizzie interrupted. “You have to get out of bed; you have to fill the pot with water.” I protested and shouted “LIZ! LIZ!” at her to get her to stop, but it didn’t work—the joke was rolling. What I should have done was point out that Matt makes her coffee for her every day …Lizzie: That’s just equal division of labor.At this point, we moved the party up to the roof, mostly because everyone was sweating, but maybe also because we had been discussing the logic of Disney’s The Santa Clause, which only works if you accept the premise that standing on a roof can be deadly, even if you’re Santa Claus.If you’ve ever been on a roof in Brooklyn, you can probably imagine Andrew’s: concrete, random cobwebs of wires, a big old table with a single chair eroded by rain, views of the Coney Island Parachute Jump. It was really lovely, but the location shift did mean we effectively traded in Andrew’s carefully designed Watergate setting for the chance at a rooftop breeze. Later, Andrew told me that he thinks the problem with a lot of theme parties is that the hosts rely too much on guests to set the scene, forcing them to wear costumes or speak in British accents or whatever. As the host, he believed that it was his job, and his alone, to make sure the theme landed. I should have known the theme would not be bound by walls!For a while, I captivated the roof by talking about a strange thing that had happened to me earlier in the day: I found two pecans sitting in the bottom of my iced latte. It didn’t really bother me—the latte tasted fine, and what’s a nut between friends? But still, I wondered: How did the nuts get there? Were they meant for me? A threat? Someone crossing their fingers that I was allergic? Like Kaitlyn before me, I felt the paranoia start to creep in. Here I am, still standing, you fools!Little did I know, but I was about to have my second pecan experience of the day when Andrew brought the desserts up to the roof, including his attempt at a “Watergate salad.” It’s a salad in the way that ambrosia is a salad; plus, it’s green. Pistachio-pudding mix, canned pineapple, marshmallows, Cool Whip, and pecans. I ate it, refusing to look at my upside-down cake. The pecans added a nice crunch.Kaitlyn: I tried everything! After dessert, Andrew tapped a knife on the side of a wine bottle to get everyone’s attention. He thanked us all for coming and then announced that he had prepared a plate of cottage cheese and pineapple, as well as a glass of milk—re-creating the final meal Nixon ate before he resigned. He was wondering if anyone would like to play Nixon.Nathan volunteered, to much applause on the roof, and then things got very ceremonial. He sat down in the middle of the lone table. Andrew was like, “Okay, I’ll be right back, I’m gonna grab that meal, and we’re all going to enjoy watching you eat it.” People really did gather around to watch, for some reason.\r\nNathan drinks a glass of milk. (Courtesy of Kaitlyn Tiffany)\r\nLizzie: I felt Nathan was very brave, volunteering to be the entertainment. Agreeing to sit on a dark roof and drink milk while people watch you. “It doesn’t taste very good,” he said, eating the cottage cheese and pineapple that Andrew had placed in front of him. I watched Nathan while shoving Spicy Mustard Doritos into my mouth so that I wouldn’t somehow taste Nixon’s creamy last meal through proximity.Andrew, Kaitlyn, and I had never tried cottage cheese before, so we all agreed to change that. I wasn’t looking forward to it. Andrew went first and managed it okay. Then I took a small bite, pitifully. My pulse quickened, and I turned my back to the crowd. The taste was fine—mild nothingness. But the texture. The small, curdled snot lumps? Cheesy silica-gel balls suspended in thick drool? I squeezed my eyes shut hard and tried to think about anything other than what was happening in my mouth. Palm trees, orange tea, Joe Pera, my pants. I somehow managed to swallow, praying for one more sip to appear in my now-empty leisure-soda bottle. I don’t mean to upset anyone, but the truth is, I’m a gagger. Once, just touching my faux-velvet sunglasses case on a really hot day made me gag. Why do they make it feel like that? Like an old car seat.Then Kaitlyn ate the cottage cheese, and it was basically the best thing she’d ever tasted. It was time to make ourselves scarce.Kaitlyn: On the walk home, the three of us debriefed. We talked about how amazing the Spicy Mustard Doritos had been and wondered whether we could order them in bulk for future parties. We also shared our horror at hearing a party guest tell everyone that, although she moved out of her rent-stabilized apartment in Brooklyn four years ago, she has been illegally subletting the place to various renters this whole time and making many hundreds of dollars a month. My voice recorder had been off during that conversation, or, I tell you—we would be placing a call.On Sunday morning, I woke up early and read about the 100th birthday party that some Nixon “loyalists,” including Henry Kissinger and Pat Buchanan, threw for him after he was dead. Reportedly, Buchanan, in his speech, paraphrased a line from The Great Gatsby, saying, “They were a rotten crowd, sir. You're worth the whole damn bunch put together.” Who’s … “they”? The American people? Me and Lizzie and all of our friends?Lizzie: The old jackal pack!",

        "description": "Marcus Stroman surrounded by Toronto media in his first return to Canada since he was traded by the Blue Jays in 2019 | Rick Madonik/Toronto Star via Getty Images\n    \n\n  We’re going to find some good stuff in a down week. Since the last update in this series, the Cubs have won just one game (last Wednesday in Toronto) and been shut out twice.\nNevertheless, I persist, and am going to present here three things that are positive about the Cubs as they get ready for a homestand starting tonight. (There’ll be “three down,” also, and trust me, that list could have been a lot longer.)\nThree up\nMarcus Stroman continues his road dominance\nStroman made two starts over this time period, threw 12 total innings and allowed one run (0.75 ERA, 0.750 WHIP) and his dominance on the road continues: 1.84 ERA, 0.981 WHIP in 12 starts covering 68⅓ innings.\nNow, Marcus, try doing that at Wrigley, where you have a 6.92 ERA and 1.488 WHIP in eight starts covering 40⅓ innings.\nHe did make a friend for life in Toronto:\n\n\nFormer Blue Jay Marcus Stroman met an emotional young fan before today's game in Toronto   The fan and his mother traveled from the UK to see Stroman, who welcomed them with tickets to next year's London classic between the Cubs and Cardinals. pic.twitter.com/DkYhQ8JTbR— FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) August 30, 2022\n\n\n\nIan Happ edges closer to a milestone\nHapp doubled twice this past week and now has 36. The last Cub to hit 40 doubles in a season was Javier Báez, who had 40 in 2018, and the last Cub to have more than 40 was Anthony Rizzo, who had 43 in 2016. Happ’s 36 doubles are tied for third in the NL with Starling Marte, Austin Riley and Nolan Arenado, pretty good company.\nMark Leiter Jr. might turn out to be a useful reliever after all\nLeiter has thrown three scoreless innings since the last update in this series and overall since he was moved permanently to the bullpen July 10: 15 appearances, 22⅔ innings, 2.38 ERA, 1.059 WHIP, .191 opponents BA. That’ll play in just about anyone’s pen.\nThree down\nA repeat “three down” appearance for Sean Newcomb\nNewcomb was in the last edition, and trust me you do not need to have the details repeated. Thing is, he pretty much repeated them on the field since that update, getting hammered for five runs in two innings’ work Saturday in St. Louis, including a pair of home runs.\nI would think Newcomb will be DFA later today to make room on the 40-man and 28-man rosters for Wade Miley, who will be activated to start tonight’s game against the Reds at Wrigley Field.\nZach McKinstry: What’s the point?\nDo we really need to see more of this guy to know he won’t fit into next year’s plans? He had another two-hit game since the last update — his third multi-hit game since joining the Cubs — but those were the only hits he had in a 2-for-11 stretch over the last four games. \nI suppose there’s no harm in keeping him on the bench for the rest of the year, but really, Nick Madrigal should be starting every day at second base.\nThe team as a whole had a lousy road trip\nThe Cubs went 2-7 on the trip, were shut out three times and overall were outscored 52-29.",

        "description": "Photo by Michael Owens/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The argument against the Yankees propping up IKF as a top-tier defensive shortstop goes beyond mere numbers. Look, I’m not here to bash Isiah Kiner-Falefa as a person. He seems like an extremely hard worker with the drive to be a productive major league player, and he doesn’t deserve the over-the-line vitriol directed at his family. What I’m doing here is questioning the Yankees’ analysis of IKF as a highly-skilled defensive shortstop. There have been several instances that make me feel like they’re doing everything they can to confirm their belief that IKF is a great defender because they made the trade for him. In other words, if this isn’t confirmation bias at its finest, then I don’t know what is.\nYou’ve heard me say this before, but I strongly prefer Statcast’s Outs Above Average (OAA) metric to other publicly available defensive metrics. Why? The main reason is that they have more data. It’s not a perfect metric because there is no such thing as one, but it aligns with the eye test more than any other defensive metric. On the year, IKF ranks in the 29th percentile for OAA, well below average but not the very worst.\nThis makes a ton of sense! Kiner-Falefa gets decent reactions and is quite a fast mover (82nd percentile sprint speed). He has decent range, but often lacks the footwork to make many plays that are possible from a pure “he got there on time” standpoint. Zooming in a little, Statcast tells us that this is mainly due to his limitations at charging the ball. He has -8 OAA on plays that they define as “In” and last year that same number was -13.\n  \n        \n  \nThe above leaderboard shows shortstops with at least 100 plate appearances at the position in 2022. Kiner-Falefa, and other Yankees shortstops, play deeper than almost anybody in the league. When considering his weakness in charging the ball, it’s a bit confusing to see that he plays this deep on a consistent basis. The Yankees have their reasoning for this shift, but to me, it feels as if they are exposing their shortstop’s most glaring limitation.\nNow, charging the ball is an important trait for a shortstop to have, especially for those who play very deep. The skill is difficult and requires a few abilities. The first is the read off the bat — this is all about instincts. Reading swings and pitch locations aren’t easy things to do from shortstop, but they’re how the best defenders create the right angles and attack the ball with the most efficient footwork possible. The latter two points are the other aspects of charging the baseball: angle and footwork.  \nSo why does Kiner-Falefa consistently struggle with these tasks, and how do the truly elite defensive shortstops do it? There’s plenty to explore here. Starting on Sunday against Tampa Bay, we saw two plays from IKF which are perfectly representative of his struggles. The first was a fielding error on a rolled-over groundball with Frankie Montas on the bump and Manuel Margot at the plate.\n\nBy all definitions, this is as routine as routine gets. It’s not the first time that Kiner-Falefa has done this during the season, so it’s not as if I’m nitpicking either. I should make it clear that this is considered a ball that he has to move in for by Statcast’s definition since it required him to move from his original position.\nOkay, now let’s think through the feet. To do this, I’ll show you the video in slow motion:\n\nKiner-Falefa starts off decently enough. To field a routine grounder right at you, you should start to create an angle around the ball, which drives your feet towards first base. This gives your hips and hands space to work through to first base on a more direct angle, rather than fielding the ball and then adjusting your body to make the throw.\nHowever, from that point on, Kiner-Falefa has a change of thought because he misreads the hop. This may be due to him not being used to the faster groundballs on turf, but let’s be honest, that’s not an excuse for a major league shortstop to make an error on a grounder this easy. \nThe hesitation is enough to keep Kiner-Falefa flat-footed on a crucial step in which he should be aligning himself to first base. It shifts his weight backwards, leading to him trying to create the angle with a drop step in his left leg. It’s quite possible that he could have made the throw from this position, but he needed to overcome it with a rapid-fire exchange and side-arm throw. He failed to do either. \nWatch Francisco Lindor instead:\n\nI know that I’m picking arguably the best defensive shortstop here, but there’s reason for it. Lindor makes routine groundballs look routine. There is a moment here when he stops his weight shift. Why? Because he is reading the hop so he can readjust his feet to make that angle towards first base that we’ve talked about. In that pause, he maintains his athletic position, making the weight shit/feet realignment smooth and easy.\nMeanwhile, when Kiner-Falefa has his pause to read the hop, he loses his legs from under him. It’s so simple, but this movement is the difference between making the play and not making the play. Just like hitting, it’s very important to stay connected to the ground and keep your legs under you. \n\nA few innings later, Kiner-Falefa had a chance to redeem himself. He changed his tempo attacking the ball because he knows that whatever he did last time did not work. Jose Siri is very fast — 99th percentile fast, in fact — so the shortstop rightfully had a little fire under him on the grounder. \nHowever, the ball was hit decently hard and Kiner-Falefa was probably in too much of a hurry to get Siri. Just like in the previous misplay, IKF does not stay connected to the ground and does not create a direct line towards shortstop with his hips. Instead, he attempts to throw off one foot with all the time in the world to make the play. It’s frankly baffling to see. I don’t want to argue that it’s a mental thing, since he’s made similar plays many times this year, but I’m dumbfounded at the decision-making process.\n\nEven on another play which is a routine flip, Kiner-Falefa finds himself off-balance. The proper sequencing here is staying in an athletic position while taking a slight side-shuffle while opening up his hips to second base with two feet underneath him. Again, he takes a one-legged staggered approach to the ball and looks clearly uncomfortable doing it. The play is made, but it’s another example of IKF not having the proper fundamentals to make routine plays with 100-percent confidence.\nAgain, back to Lindor:\n\nChop, chop, chop, enter the fielding position and follow the flip through the bag. This is another tactic to handle this type of groundball.\nI’m not saying that Kiner-Falefa needs to be Lindor! Rather, he could learn a lesson or two about how to change tempos and create angles to make plays easily. I didn’t select plays of Lindor running into the hole or up the middle and doing something that nobody else can. These are tailor-made plays that should be replicated by any MLB-caliber shortstop.\nI’ll leave you with this: Great shortstops know how to change their stride length on the drop of a hat to readjust their body and make a play like this one from teammate Oswald Peraza:\n\nThe rookie was preparing to flip the ball, and then suddenly realized that he could make the play on his own if he took a few shorter strides and oriented himself toward second. Honestly, this is something I’ve never seen Kiner-Falefa do. I’m sure he has made a play similar to this one, but it’s never this smooth or with this awareness of his body. \nProprioception affects every aspect of baseball. Knowing where you are on the field and how your body moves on the field all affect outcomes. Isiah Kiner-Falefa’s fundamental limitations at shortstop are negatively impacted by his ability to readjust his body while making plays. These are things you can get away with at second and/or third (where he’s actually won a Gold Glove), but at shortstop, the holes are exposed.\nIt’s possible that over time, Kiner-Falefa can improve at every single one of these things, but at this moment in time, it limits his floor and ceiling. The Yankees are in a position where they do not need to give players like this time to figure it out. They have financial resources and talented prospects. I know it’s unlikely that he loses his spot this year, but my goodness, stop telling us things like he is a top 5-7 defensive shortstop. I don’t care what your internal metrics say. Watch some video and get back to me.",

        "description": "Dominic Hamel\n    \n\n  What minor league players put up the best numbers this past week, August 30th to September 4th? Omar De Los Santos\nWeek: 6 G, 22 AB, .409/.480/.773, 9 H, 2 2B, 0 3B, 2 HR, 2 BB, 3 K, 3/5 SB (Single-A)\n2022 Season: 111 G, 431 AB, .272/.339/.459, 117 H, 23 2B, 5 3B, 16 HR, 35 BB, 151 K, 70/85 SB, .380 BABIP (Single-A)\nOmar De Los Santos was signed by the Mets in early February 2019, late in the 2019-2020 international signing period, an 18-year-old turning 19 during the season. He played in the Dominican Summer League that year, appearing for both Mets DSL teams and hitting a combined .274/.359/.416 with 4 home runs, 13 stolen bases, and 22 walks to 42 strikeouts. He missed the 2020 season due to the cancellation of the season due to COVID-19, but returned in 2021, assigned to the FCL Mets. He appeared in seven games with them, logging at least one hit in every single one, and was promoted to the St. Lucie Mets for the remainder of the season. De Los Santos did not enjoy the same success in the 38 games he played with them, hitting .241/.292/.331 in 38 games, but his first season stateside was a solid one, as he combined to hit .273/.318/.416 in 47 games with 3 home runs, 14 stolen bases, and 8 walks to 53 strikeouts. The Mets assigned the 22-year-old to St. Lucie for a second consecutive season, and the outfielder had much more success this time around, though his season may be ending prematurely, as he seemingly hurt his hand sliding into second base in the bottom of the first inning on Sunday’s 8-3 win over the Jupiter Hammerheads.\nDe Los Santos stands square at the plate, holding his hands high. While he has been getting on base at an great rate this season, his hit tool is below average and not expected to hold up particularly well at higher levels of the minor league ladder. His swing is long-levered and whippy, quick through the zone without much control. He has 151 strikeouts through 111 games with St. Lucie, a 31.6% strikeout rate that is fourth highest in the system behind Carlos Dominguez (167), Shervyen Newton (160), and Luke Ritter (152). His swing generates some power, he has 16 home runs on the season and he’s averaged an 85 MPH exit velocity in 256 recorded batted ball events, with 56 registering 100 MPH or higher and 5 even registering 110 MPH or higher, but at the higher levels, it really is unlikely to work.\nDe Los Santos’ carrying tool is his speed, evidenced by his 70 stolen bases this season, not only the most in the Florida State League, but tied for the most in all of minor league baseball along with Milwaukee Brewers farmhand Esteury Ruiz. De Los Santos has above-average, borderline plus speed, giving him the ability to steal plenty of bases, stretch singles, and take extra bases.\nDominic Hamel\nWeek: 1 G (0 GS), 7.0 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 9 K (High-A)\nSeason: 24 G (23 GS), 112.0 IP, 79 H, 46 R, 43 ER (3.46 ERA), 55 BB, 137 K, .282 BABIP (Low-A/High-A)\n\nA few days after Week Eleven, when Hamel was pitcher of the week for the first time, the right-hander was promoted from Single-A St. Lucie to High-A Brooklyn. With the exception of a bump in the road at the end of August- one that he has recovered from nicely, given his last start, Hamel has been extremely effective in Brooklyn. In 48.2 total innings, Hamel has a 2.96 ERA with the Cyclones, having allowed 31 hits, walked 24, and struck out 66.\nHamel’s continued development will be important to a system that is virtually devoid of legitimate pitching prospects in the upper levels of the minors. Years of utilizing a draft strategy to maximize the returns from the first few rounds at the expense of the rest and being very liberal with trading away players have really hamstringed the organization in this regard. Jose Butto is virtually the only (with Josh Walker’s status currently up in the air due to injuries) prospect in the upper levels of the Mets’ minor league system- and as documented, he is a highly flawed pitcher.\nAlong with Hamel, teammates Junior Santos, Luis Moreno, Garrison Bryant, Mike Vasil, and Keyshawn Askew will be the next cohort of pitchers who will be presumably in the upper minors in 2023 and beyond. All have had varying degrees of success in St. Lucie and Brooklyn this season, but will be tested at Double-A. Hamel included, none feature any one particularly above-average pitch at this point that they will be able to lean on. Assuming natural attrition takes place due to that fact, it is imperative for one of these pitchers to take the next important step forward in order to develop into the next generation of pitchers to have use to the Mets. \nPlayers of the Week 2022\n\nWeek One (April 5-April 17): Francisco Alvarez/Jose Butto\n\nWeek Two (April 19-April 24): Daniel Palka/Keyshawn Askew\n\nWeek Three (April 26-May 1): Shervyen Newton/Alec Kisena\n\nWeek Four (May 3-May 8): Alex Ramirez/David Peterson\n\nWeek Five: (May 10-May 15): Brett Baty/Jose Chacin\n\nWeek Six: (May 17-May 22): Jaylen Palmer/Mike Vasil\n\nWeek Seven (May 24th-May 29th): Francisco Alvarez/Connor Grey\n\nWeek Eight (May 31-June 5th): Khalil Lee/Jose Butto\n\nWeek Nine (June 7-June 12): Stanley Consuegra/Nick Zwack\n\nWeek Ten (June 14-June 19): Daniel Palka/Alex Valverde\n\nWeek Eleven (June 21-June 26): Travis Blankenhorn/Dominic Hamel\n\nWeek Twelve (June 28-July 3): Alex Ramirez/Luis Moreno\n\nWeek Thirteen (July 4-July 10): Gosuke Katoh/Nick Zwack\n\nWeek Fourteen (July 11-July 17): Stanley Consuegra/Carson Seymour\n\nWeek Fifteen (July 21-July 24): Alex Ramirez/Carson Seymour\n\nWeek Sixteen (July 25-July 31): Karell Paz/Luis Moreno &amp; Keyshawn Askew\n\nWeek Seventeen (August 1-August 7): Brett Baty/Joel Diaz\n\nWeek Eighteen (August 8-August 14): Carlos Dominguez/ Douglas Orellana\n\nWeek Nineteen (August 15-August 21): Mark Vientos/Douglas Orellana\n\nWeek Twenty (August 22-August 28): Shervyen Newton/Jeffrey Colon",

        "description": "The progressive nonprofit organization Community Change Action (CCA) and its super PAC arm will spend $10 million ahead of the November midterm elections in an effort to increase voter turnout for people of color.\n\n\n\nIn a memo obtained by The Hill, CCA and the affiliated Community Change Voters super PAC announced a campaign effort \"targeting high-potential, low-propensity voters of color in races where these voters can provide the margin of victory.\"\n\n\n\nCCA will target six states in the voter engagement initiative: Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin. \n\n\n\nThe engagement campaign includes a goal of reaching 1 million potential voters through the phone, online or at events to encourage them to vote and inform them on election-related information.\n\n\n\nPolls for the Nov. 8 elections to determine control of Congress and statewide offices have tightened as a once-significant Republican advantage has dwindled and Democrats have won recent bellwether tests in New York and Alaska House races by campaigning on abortion rights.\n\n\n\nCCA estimates that Democrats have an opportunity to retain control of Congress if they can mobilize communities of color ahead of November.\n\n\n\n\"Despite a challenging political environment, Democrats have an unprecedented opportunity to advance the progressive agenda this November if Black, brown and low-income voters are mobilized and turn out to vote,\" CCA officials wrote in the memo. \"Our program is designed to achieve that goal so that we can continue to move our country forward with policies for an economy where we can all thrive.\"\n\n\n\nIn Arizona, CCA is focused on reelecting Sen. Mark Kelly (D) over his GOP opponent, Blake Masters, and electing Democrat Reginald Bolding for secretary of state against Republican Mark Finchem.\n\n\n\nThe organization will work to boost Democrats in the other five states on the targeted list, including Sen. Raphael Warnock in Georgia and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan, while striving to defeat Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin by supporting Democratic candidate Mandela Barnes.\n\n\n\nIn New Mexico, CCA will additionally push voters to support a ballot initiative that would enshrine child care into the state's constitution.\n\n\n\nCCA said a major focus this year will be to \"invest heavily in digital organizing\" and coordinate campaign efforts with local community influencers.\n\n\n\n\"With our partners, we are providing a political home to thousands of Americans who want to be engaged on issues they care about,\" the memo reads.",

        "description": "Enjoying the serenity of Central Park.\nBy Audrey Campbell\nGood Tuesday morning, to you! My name’s Charlie and I’m a 12-year-old Goldendoodle and lifetime Pupper West Sider.\nEveryone who knows me well knows that I tend to gravitate toward bodies of water. When I’m in the city, that means you can find me basking in the serenity of the Central Park turtle pond alongside Belvedere Castle. (PSA for Pups: Never swim in the Central Park ponds and lakes because the algae is toxic. Just enjoy them from afar.) When I’m away from the neighborhood, I love to spend time on the beach. I guess you could call me a cosmopolitan beach bum.\nI love the beach.\nPerhaps you already guessed that I spend a lot of time in the sun and surf from my hair? These tousled sun-kissed highlights are completely natural &#8211; no four-hour hair salon appointments for me, no sir! This blonde mane is the product of long days spent in the sun, either picnicking on the Great Lawn in Central Park or romping around in the surf. This summer, I was lucky to get to spend time sniffing the fresh sea-salt air and taking sunset walks.\nI&#8217;m a lucky dog.\nNow that I’m back from vacation and school is starting again, I’m enjoying the opportunity to catch up with all of my Upper West Side local friends and hear what they did this summer. On my daily walks, I make a special stop into Alden Cleaners and Little Creatures to say hello and take a look around. I might pick up one of my favorite deep-sea delicacies &#8212; the oh-so-crunchy cod skins from Open Farm. They’re a great source of Omega-3 fatty acids which help me maintain joint health as I age.\nHelping out.\nFellow Pupper West Siders often notice me carrying my trademark bag on the beach and in the city. It’s not a handbag, per se, it’s more like a coin purse or fanny pack. It holds all my going out essentials &#8211; treats, poop bags, etc. &#8211; and I like to help Mom out by offering to carry it home every day. People always stop and laugh when they see me high-stepping it down the street with my bag in my mouth.\nIn fact, I’m looking forward to putting some cash in my bag and trotting over to The Strand Bookstore on Columbus Avenue to pick up some new reading material. This summer I’ve been enjoying some water-centric reads including “The Breath of a Whale” by Leigh Calvez and “How To Read Water” by Tristan Gooley. As we look ahead to the fall, I think I’ll switch gears and pick up a copy of John Banville’s award-winning novel, “The Sea”.\nIf you happen to see me reading it on a Central Park bench, make sure to stop and say hello!\nI love the city.\nIf you think your pup deserves a shot at neighborhood fame, we encourage you to reach out to Audrey at pupperwestsideuws@gmail.com to be considered for a future profile on West Side Rag and follow your fellow Pupper West Sider’s adventures on Instagram @pupper_west_side_uws\n&nbsp;",

        "description": "Laurence Fox and Gina Carano star in an unhinged low-budget drama based less on fact and more on conspiracy theoryWriting critically about a film like My Son Hunter feels kind of like sending the kid making fart noises from the back of the class to detention. Any measure of reprimand means giving the troublemaker exactly what they want – engagement, which is to say attention, which is to say validation. When your only goal is to get a rise out of a perceived opponent, even the most cool-headed retort means the game is on.In the case of far-right ear-flicking such as this fiction-laced retelling of the Hunter Biden laptop nothingburger, a writeup in a semi-reputable publication like the Guardian gives hyperventilating Breitbart commenters all the ammo they need to prove that the libs have been thoroughly and irrefutably triggered. The truth is that the latest feature-length output from the conservative peanut gallery poses little threat to the viewing public, its foamy-mouthed partisanship speaking only to those already simpatico to its theories and alienating the saner majority within its opening minutes. It doesn’t deserve time or mental energy from right-thinking citizens, but if the past decade of American politics has taught us anything, it’s that ignoring extremism does not make it go away.

        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/09/rabid-raccoons-rabies-oral-vaccine-packets/671347/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "The story of America’s rabid raccoons begins in Florida. Rabies was once rarely found in raccoons, but in the ’50s, an outbreak began spreading from the Sunshine State. It diffused first to neighboring states and then made a great leap north into the mid-Atlantic, possibly via the shipment of over 3,500 Florida raccoons to hunting preserves in Virginia. From there, rabid raccoons ambled their way as far north as Canada and as far west as Ohio. The East Coast became “one solid belt of raccoon rabies,” says Charles Rupprecht, the former chief of the CDC’s rabies program.In the early days of the outbreak, officials quickly realized that mass killings of raccoons would not be popular with the public. Residents on one Florida island with a rabies outbreak were so attached to their raccoons that a restaurant owner was feeding them 400 pounds of dog food a month.For the past 30 years, the U.S. government has embarked on a far more unusual and elaborate campaign: mass immunization of raccoons. Every summer and fall, the USDA, in collaboration with local agencies, drops millions of packets of oral rabies vaccines over the U.S. by air and by hand. The vaccines come in two flavors: fish meal and vanilla. When a hungry raccoon bites into the packet, the liquid vaccine coats its mouth, immunizing it against the rabies virus. We’re now trying to save raccoons from the rabies outbreak we once unwittingly helped unleash. As far as management strategies for dangerous wildlife go, mass immunization is a pretty gentle one.A similar vaccine campaign has already eliminated strains of rabies from coyotes and foxes in the Southwest. It has also slowly pushed back the northern front of rabid raccoons from Canada into Maine. The immediate objective is to prevent rabies from spreading any farther north or west, but eventually, says Richard Chipman, the national rabies-management coordinator at USDA, “our goal is to push back rabies to the ocean. We want raccoons rabies-free by 2063.”This mass immunization effort in raccoons is ultimately a roundabout way of protecting humans. Rabid animals notoriously like to bite—the virus hijacks the central nervous system and makes animals unusually aggressive. So when rabies takes hold in a raccoon population, the virus tends to spread to other animals: feral cats, foxes, unvaccinated dogs, even humans. And rabies is virtually always fatal in humans, unless we get a timely dose of antibodies plus the vaccine, which together are known as rabies postexposure prophylaxis. When the outbreak reached New Jersey in 1989, the need for rabies postexposure prophylaxis “started going through the roof,” Rupprecht says. (The treatment costs thousands of dollars per person.) Eliminating rabies in raccoons wouldn’t eliminate rabies in the U.S. entirely, as bats are another important reservoir, but “it’s getting the biggest bang for the buck,” Chipman says. Human rabies exposures are 600 percent higher in areas where both raccoon and bat rabies circulate, compared with areas where there is only bat rabies.Two types of vaccines are now used in raccoons. The first was jointly developed by the Wistar Institute in Pennsylvania and the French biotech company Transgene in the 1980s; scientists inserted a gene for a rabies protein into another live virus called vaccinia. This vaccine worked well in lab animals, but then came the problem of how to actually inoculate raccoons in the wild. Rupprecht, who was at Wistar at the time, remembers batting around ideas to grow the virus in eggs or put it inside Slim Jims or sausages. The breakthrough came when people trying to prevent raccoons from breaking in and eating their fish baits called the scientists for help. Rupprecht and his team weren’t in the raccoon-deterring business, but they were in the raccoon-attracting business—so they thought, Why not fish? They tried encasing vaccines in fish-meal-bait polymer, which worked brilliantly. The manufacturer now also makes plastic packets of the vaccine coated in fish oil and fish meal. “We typically sort of equate it to a small ketchup packet,” says Jordona Kirby, rabies field coordinator at the USDA.The second vaccine is also made of the same rabies gene inserted into a different virus called adenovirus. This vaccine is loaded into a blister pack, which is in turn coated in edible vanilla wax. Technically, it’s still experimental; the USDA team has been field-testing it since 2011 and expects FDA approval soon. Their preliminary results, Chipman says, suggest that it stimulates much higher antibody levels in raccoons than the older vaccine does.Distributing the vaccine is a three-pronged process. Small airplanes equipped with a conveyer belt—“a little bait treadmill,” Kirby says—drop the vaccines over large, empty rural expanses. Helicopters that can fly lower drop them over suburbs. Dense urban areas are the hardest to reach: The team actually walks around setting up bait stations or J-shaped tubes filled with the fish-meal polymer cubes. The idea is to make sure that raccoons, specifically, try to eat these; they can reach into the pipes with their dexterous hands, whereas possums, skunks, and feral cats cannot. The program is aiming to vaccinate at least 60 percent of raccoons in an area to stop the spread.The team—and those who come after—still have a lot of work ahead in eliminating rabies in raccoons by 2063. “I’ll be, in fact, 103 then, but I hope to still be standing and smiling and cheering these guys on,” Chipman told me over the phone from West Virginia, where he had just finished supervising the distribution of rabies vaccines. In October, he’ll be out in the field again for the second leg of the campaign, this time starting in Virginia and going south until the ocean.",

        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/09/rabid-raccoons-rabies-oral-vaccine-packets/671347/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "The story of America’s rabid raccoons begins in Florida. Rabies was once rarely found in raccoons, but in the ’50s, an outbreak began spreading from the Sunshine State. It diffused first to neighboring states and then made a great leap north into the mid-Atlantic, possibly via the shipment of over 3,500 Florida raccoons to hunting preserves in Virginia. From there, rabid raccoons ambled their way as far north as Canada and as far west as Ohio. The East Coast became “one solid belt of raccoon rabies,” says Charles Rupprecht, the former chief of the CDC’s rabies program.In the early days of the outbreak, officials quickly realized that mass killings of raccoons would not be popular with the public. Residents on one Florida island with a rabies outbreak were so attached to their raccoons that a restaurant owner was feeding them 400 pounds of dog food a month.For the past 30 years, the U.S. government has embarked on a far more unusual and elaborate campaign: mass immunization of raccoons. Every summer and fall, the USDA, in collaboration with local agencies, drops millions of packets of oral rabies vaccines over the U.S. by air and by hand. The vaccines come in two flavors: fish meal and vanilla. When a hungry raccoon bites into the packet, the liquid vaccine coats its mouth, immunizing it against the rabies virus. We’re now trying to save raccoons from the rabies outbreak we once unwittingly helped unleash. As far as management strategies for dangerous wildlife go, mass immunization is a pretty gentle one.A similar vaccine campaign has already eliminated strains of rabies from coyotes and foxes in the Southwest. It has also slowly pushed back the northern front of rabid raccoons from Canada into Maine. The immediate objective is to prevent rabies from spreading any farther north or west, but eventually, says Richard Chipman, the national rabies-management coordinator at USDA, “our goal is to push back rabies to the ocean. We want raccoons rabies-free by 2063.”This mass immunization effort in raccoons is ultimately a roundabout way of protecting humans. Rabid animals notoriously like to bite—the virus hijacks the central nervous system and makes animals unusually aggressive. So when rabies takes hold in a raccoon population, the virus tends to spread to other animals: feral cats, foxes, unvaccinated dogs, even humans. And rabies is virtually always fatal in humans, unless we get a timely dose of antibodies plus the vaccine, which together are known as rabies postexposure prophylaxis. When the outbreak reached New Jersey in 1989, the need for rabies postexposure prophylaxis “started going through the roof,” Rupprecht says. (The treatment costs thousands of dollars per person.) Eliminating rabies in raccoons wouldn’t eliminate rabies in the U.S. entirely, as bats are another important reservoir, but “it’s getting the biggest bang for the buck,” Chipman says. Human rabies exposures are 600 percent higher in areas where both raccoon and bat rabies circulate, compared with areas where there is only bat rabies.Two types of vaccines are now used in raccoons. The first was jointly developed by the Wistar Institute in Pennsylvania and the French biotech company Transgene in the 1980s; scientists inserted a gene for a rabies protein into another live virus called vaccinia. This vaccine worked well in lab animals, but then came the problem of how to actually inoculate raccoons in the wild. Rupprecht, who was at Wistar at the time, remembers batting around ideas to grow the virus in eggs or put it inside Slim Jims or sausages. The breakthrough came when people trying to prevent raccoons from breaking in and eating their fish baits called the scientists for help. Rupprecht and his team weren’t in the raccoon-deterring business, but they were in the raccoon-attracting business—so they thought, Why not fish? They tried encasing vaccines in fish-meal-bait polymer, which worked brilliantly. The manufacturer now also makes plastic packets of the vaccine coated in fish oil and fish meal. “We typically sort of equate it to a small ketchup packet,” says Jordona Kirby, rabies field coordinator at the USDA.The second vaccine is also made of the same rabies gene inserted into a different virus called adenovirus. This vaccine is loaded into a blister pack, which is in turn coated in edible vanilla wax. Technically, it’s still experimental; the USDA team has been field-testing it since 2011 and expects FDA approval soon. Their preliminary results, Chipman says, suggest that it stimulates much higher antibody levels in raccoons than the older vaccine does.Distributing the vaccine is a three-pronged process. Small airplanes equipped with a conveyer belt—“a little bait treadmill,” Kirby says—drop the vaccines over large, empty rural expanses. Helicopters that can fly lower drop them over suburbs. Dense urban areas are the hardest to reach: The team actually walks around setting up bait stations or J-shaped tubes filled with the fish-meal polymer cubes. The idea is to make sure that raccoons, specifically, try to eat these; they can reach into the pipes with their dexterous hands, whereas possums, skunks, and feral cats cannot. The program is aiming to vaccinate at least 60 percent of raccoons in an area to stop the spread.The team—and those who come after—still have a lot of work ahead in eliminating rabies in raccoons by 2063. “I’ll be, in fact, 103 then, but I hope to still be standing and smiling and cheering these guys on,” Chipman told me over the phone from West Virginia, where he had just finished supervising the distribution of rabies vaccines. In October, he’ll be out in the field again for the second leg of the campaign, this time starting in Virginia and going south until the ocean.",

His campaign has acknowledged his obvious struggles with “auditory processing” and speech, but the persistence of those struggles has contrasted with the campaign’s rosier predictions of a return to the rigors of campaigning, including debating his opponent, Mehmet Oz.&#8221;\n&#8220;If Mr. Fetterman is not well enough to debate his opponent, that raises serious concerns about his ability to serve as a United States senator.&#8221;\n&#8220;None of this excuses the antics of Mr. Oz’s campaign, which has decided that its candidate will benefit from dragging the race deeper and deeper into the muck&#8230; Mr. Oz has decided, oddly, to distance himself from his own campaign’s actions, as if it’s an unaffiliated super PAC.&#8221;",

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) replied that the news “ruined” his day.\n\n\n\n“Thanks for nothing,” the 49-year-old said, later tweeting that he was “embarrassed” that he “spent so much of my morning doing poor Golden Girls age math.”\n\n\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) appeared to share in his Senate colleague’s outrage.\n\n\n\n“This is the most horrible thing I’ve read in years,” Cruz, 51, wrote on Twitter.\n\n\n\nWhile her age wasn’t explicitly stated in the show, McClanahan, who played the youngest “Golden Girl,” Blanche Devereaux, on the series, was 51 when the sitcom premiered in 1985. The “Friends” actors include Matthew Perry, 53, Jennifer Aniston, 53, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer, 55, Courteney Cox, 58, and Lisa Kudrow, 59.\n\n\n\nMcCann credited himself with uniting a fractured Congress.\n\n\n\n“Look. I unified the Senate,” McCann quipped. “Now I’m president.”",

The democratic project is not threatened by the existence of a powerful standing military so long as civilian and military leaders — and the rank-and-file they lead — embrace and implement effective civilian control.”\n\n\n\nThe signatories, which include Trump’s former Defense Secretaries James Mattis and Mark Esper, note that “military officers swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution, not an oath of fealty to an individual or to an office” and that civilian control is shared by all three government branches.\n\n\n\n“There are significant limits on the public role of military personnel in partisan politics. … Members of the military accept limits on the public expression of their private views — limits that would be unconstitutional if imposed on other citizens. Military and civilian leaders must be diligent about keeping the military separate from partisan political activity.”\n\n\n\nThe letter also affirms that elected civilians “have the right to be wrong … even if other voices warn in advance that the proposed action is a mistake” and that military officials must carry out legal orders even if they doubt the action.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn closing, the letter highlights the military’s duty during presidential elections to serve the current commander in chief and prepare for the next one, as chosen by voters.\n\n\n\nAlong with Mattis and Esper, the letter is signed by former Defense Secretaries Ashton Carter, Robert Gates, Leon Panetta, Chuck Hagel, William Perry and William Cohen.\n\n\n\nRetired Gens. Martin Dempsey, Joseph Dunford Jr., Peter Pace and Richard Myers signed as former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with retired Adm. Mike Mullen.",

        "description": "Senate Democrats’ campaign arm on Tuesday released its first general election television ad targeting Adam Laxalt in Nevada, slamming the Republican Senate nominee for his abortion stance.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) said the ad, titled “Historic,” is part of its $8.4 million ad reservation in Nevada this fall.\n\n\n\n“Adam Laxalt praised the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade,” the ad begins, also noting that Laxalt called Roe v. Wade a “joke” in June and described the Supreme Court’s overturning of abortion rights later that month as “a historic victory.”\n\n\n\nAbortion is protected in Nevada through 24 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions after that point for cases where the mother's health or life is in danger. The law cannot be repealed without a ballot measure being posed directly to voters.\n\n\n\n“Laxalt supported overturning Nevada’s abortion protections,” the ad continues. “He’d let states outlaw it, even for victims of rape and incest. Adam Laxalt’s not for us.”\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Laxalt's campaign for comment.\n\n\n\nLaxalt’s challenge to incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D) is shaping up to be one of the most closely watched races of this year’s Senate elections, with Republicans hoping to flip the seat.\n\n\n\nNonpartisan election analysts like the Cook Political Report and Sabato’s Crystal Ball rate the race as a toss up. \n\n\n\nPolls have mostly given Cortez Masto a slight lead, and FiveThirtyEight indicates she has a 62 percent chance of retaining her seat.\n\n\n\nThe ad is part of the DSCC’s $33 million in total ad reservations this fall nationwide.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats had faced a dismal political environment heading into November, largely due to inflation recently hitting a 40-year high. But the party is hoping the abortion ruling, a recent string of legislative victories and controversies around former President Trump can avoid a shellacking for Democratic candidates this fall.Republicans remain favorites to take control of the House, but Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other Republicans have tempered expectations for the party's fate in Senate contests.McConnell has made references to \"candidate quality\" as reason for the disparity, seen as a veiled reference to GOP Senate nominees who are backed by Trump&nbsp;and have struggled to pull ahead of their Democratic opponents in polls.Laxalt, a Trump-backed candidate who served as the co-chairman of the former president's reelection campaign in Nevada, has echoed his unfounded claims of mass election fraud in the 2020 presidential election.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/3630460-biden-administration-steps-in-it-again-with-afghans-who-helped-us/",
        "description": "Apparently, when the Biden administration screened the Afghan nationals brought to the United States after the U.S. troop withdrawal, it discovered that some of them were inadmissible under the “terrorist activities” exclusion ground, INA section 1182(a)(3)(B) — because they had provided support for a terrorist organization, despite the fact that the support was insignificant or limited in nature.\n\n\n\nThe administration reacted to this situation the same way it reacted to the statutory enforcement provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that call for the deportation of undocumented migrants who have never been convicted of a serious criminal offense and who have lived, worked, and contributed to our economy and our communities: It tried to move the goalposts — almost certainly exceeding its authority in the process.\n\n\n\nIn the latter case, deportation was contrary to Biden’s Plan for Securing Our Values as a Nation of Immigrants, so Biden’s DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas issued a memorandum that replaced the statutory enforcement provisions with the administration’s own enforcement “guidelines,” limiting enforcement to deportable migrants who pose a threat to national security, public safety, or border security. Mayorkas explained in the memorandum that, “The fact an individual is a removable noncitizen … should not alone be the basis of an enforcement action against them.” A federal judge determined this exceeded the administration’s prosecutorial discretion authority.\n\n\n\nNow, in the case of the Afghans, the administration has published a notice in the Federal Register in which it uses its waiver authority under INA section 1182(d)(3)(B)(i) to change the definition of “material” to one that the administration prefers.\n\n\n\nThis almost certainly was not a proper use of the waiver authority.\n\n\n\nThe terrorist activities exclusion ground\n\n\n\nOne of the activities that makes a migrant inadmissible under the “terrorist activities” exclusion ground is committing an act the the actor knows, or reasonably should know, affords material support to any individual or organization the actor knows, or should know, has committed or plans to commit a terrorist activity.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Congress failed to provide adequate guidance on how to determine whether support should be considered “material.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) found in Matter of A-C-M- that there is no legislative history to support taking a quantitative approach and separating out what amount of support is necessary to make it “material.”\n\n\n\n“Material support” is a term of art that “relates to the type of aid provided” — that is, aid of a material and normally tangible nature. It is not quantitative.\n\n\n\nThe BIA decided that the term “material support” covers any action that “has a logical and even reasonably foreseeable tendency to promote, sustain, or maintain the [terrorist] organization, even if only to a de minimis degree.”\n\n\n\nThe BIA is the highest administrative body for interpreting and applying immigration laws, but its decisions can be challenged in court or by having them referred for review by the attorney general. While the administration cannot challenge a BIA decision in court, it could have had Merrick Garland refer it to himself for review.\n\n\n\nInstead, it used its authority to waive excludability for terrorist activities to replace the BIA’s definition of “material support” with a definition it prefers.\n\n\n\nThe administration’s declaration\n\n\n\nThe administration now says it has determined that grounds of inadmissibility under the terrorist activities exclusion ground “bar certain individuals who do not pose a national security or public safety risk from admission to the United States and from obtaining immigration benefits or other status.” \n\n\n\nAccordingly, the administration, claiming to be using its section 212(d)(3)(B)(i) authority, declared that that exclusion ground “shall not apply with respect to an individual who provided: (1) insignificant material support (i.e., support that was minimal in amount and inconsequential in effect); or (2) limited material support under circumstances involving certain routine commercial transactions, certain routine social transactions … certain humanitarian assistance, or substantial pressure that does not rise to the level of duress, to a designated terrorist organization.”\n\n\n\nThe pertinent part of section 1182(d)(3)(B)(i) states that the administration may determine in its “sole unreviewable discretion that subsection (a)(3)(B) [the terrorist activities exclusion ground]shall not applywith respect to an alien within the scope of that subsection.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\nThat’s not what the administration did.\n\n\n\nThe administration declared that migrants who provide support for a terrorist organization that would be considered “material” under the BIA’s definition of “material” are no longer subject to exclusion for engaging in terrorist activities if they meet specified waiver eligibility requirements, such as passing a security check — and substituted its own definition of “material.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnnecessary\n\n\n\nThe administration didn’t have to do this to achieve its stated objective.\n\n\n\nIt said in a press release that it was using its section 1182(d)(3)(B)(i) authority to ensure that vulnerable Afghans who have supported and worked with the United States in Afghanistan can qualify for protection and other immigration benefits in the United States.\n\n\n\nIt could have granted an exclusion waiver to the Afghans who fit that description without changing how “material support” is interpreted.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMy take\n\n\n\nFrankly, I don’t like the BIA’s interpretation of “material support” or the one that the administration wants.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe main difference between these interpretations is that they foster errors in different directions. The BIA’s interpretation can result in the exclusion of migrants who are not a threat of any kind, and the interpretation the administration wants can result in the admission of migrants who should be excluded for supporting terrorist activities.\n\n\n\nNeither is acceptable.\n\n\n\nCongress created this problem by not including adequate guidance on the meaning of “material support” in its terrorist activities exclusion provision. Congress should fix it.\n\n\n\nNolan Rappaport was detailed to the House Judiciary Committee as an Executive Branch Immigration Law Expert for three years.

        "description": "Venice film festival: Swinton plays both mother and daughter in a moving and disconcerting move into pseudo horror from the director of The SouvenirThere’s real intimacy and emotional generosity to this psychological mystery from Joanna Hogg – a personal movie which appears to come from the same universe as her earlier Souvenir films – or one very much like it.It’s a ghost story whose purpose is something other than scaring you, a film about the enigma of your parents’ lives, their unknowable existences before you were born and indeed after you were born; that feeling that your parents are simultaneously as familiar as a pair of old slippers and yet also a Sphinx-riddle, withholding from you the meaning of your life and death. And perhaps the only way of cracking the code, solving the problem, is finally to become your mum or dad, to feel what they feel from the inside, and yet even then never to be sure.Tilda Swinton gives a touching and wittily differentiated doppelgänger performance as a film-maker who brings her elderly mother to a country house hotel for her birthday – the hotel was once in fact a private estate where her mum spent time as a little girl. She hopes also to get some work done on her latest screenplay.Swinton of course plays both roles: both daughter and the rather amiably grand and patrician mother, whose authentic membership of the upper classes is signalled by the fact that she has brought her dog with her – Louis. (Although Hogg playfully confounds accepted class signifiers by having the mother expect fish knives at dinner – in defiance of Betjeman’s famously satirical dismissal of this kind of cutlery.)Hogg contrives Swinton’s daughter and mother nearly always to have conversations in shot-reverse-shot exchanges: you find yourself wondering when they are ever going to appear on screen together at the same time – if only cheated in a long shot. When it happens, it is the signal for an existential shift.The hotel is highly disconcerting: there was some problem with their booking – and yet there appear to be no other guests. The daughter is kept awake at night by creepy and unexplained banging noises from the other (empty) rooms. The receptionist (Carly-Sophia Davies) behaves with sub-Fawlty truculence and is unsubtly rude while serving the two women’s dinner in the gloomy mausoleum-style restaurant. But there is a very nice concierge (Joseph Mydell) who divines the daughter’s unhappiness and who turns out to be playing the mournful flute music that we hear at the beginning, a kind of diegetic reveal which would be funny in another kind of film.The mother is pleasant, good-natured, delighted at her gifts and being made a fuss of, and yet the daughter senses – as she has clearly sensed throughout her life – that her mother is suppressing some terrible sadness or pain. And she is devastated and even angered that her mother simply won’t tell her. In fact, coming back to this old house does bring back memories, many sad, and the mother is perplexed at her daughter’s tearful overreaction. The older woman, with all her generation’s reluctance to indulge their emotions, is appreciative (if a little embarrassed) about all the younger woman is doing. The daughter, for her part, is mortified by the knowledge that her mother is saddened by her childlessness; by the fact that she is to be eternally the daughter and never the mother.And it is genuinely unnerving when Swinton’s mother somehow looks older in each shot, gazing into the lens, stricken by the future. What is happening in this ghost-hotel? Sometimes it looks like a location for Rattigan’s Separate Tables – but also appears to contain the final scenes from Kubrick’s 2001.There is such closeness and tenderness in this small-scale film: I loved the moment when the mother briefly trips or stumbles walking up to the restaurant table and the daughter is instantly alarmed at the possibility she might fall, and then in the next microsecond has to convert that palpable alarm into something humorous and reassuring. The Eternal Daughter is a serious, gentle moment of self-revelation for Joanna Hogg. Continue reading...",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/fitbit-expands-afib-uk-europe-more",
        "description": "Google announced in early April that its Fitbit line of smartwatches had received FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) clearance to use a new algorithm in its products in order to help detect irregular heart rhythm conditions such as Atrial Fibrillation (AFib). By the end of April, this new feature had started to roll out to existing Fitbit devices and even included older models such as the Versa 2, Charge 3, etc. However, the new &#8220;Irregular Heart Rhythm Notification&#8221; feature was limited to working only in the United States.\n\n\n\nAccording to a report by 9to5Google, this limitation will no longer be an issue for those located in Europe, the U.K., and other select countries. This comes following the company gaining the CE mark for Irregular Heart Rhythm Notifications, which allows the use of the feature in the European Union and some other international regions. As of now, below is the list of countries where this is available:\n\n\n\n&#x2022; American Samoa&#x2022; Austria&#x2022; Belgium&#x2022; Canada&#x2022; Chile&#x2022; France&#x2022; Germany&#x2022; Guam&#x2022; Hong Kong&#x2022; Ireland&#x2022; Italy&#x2022; Luxembourg&#x2022; Netherlands&#x2022; Norway&#x2022; Poland&#x2022; Portugal&#x2022; Puerto Rico&#x2022; Romania&#x2022; Spain&#x2022; Sweden&#x2022; Switzerland&#x2022; United Kingdom&#x2022; United States&#x2022; U.S. Virgin Islands\n\n\n\nFitbit&#8217;s AFib detecting algorithm is based on PPG (photoplethysmography). It is different from what has been used before by its ECG app in that instead of doing spot checks throughout the day, it allows for long-term heart rhythm assessment. Although not meant to replace medical advice, having an alert like this can be life-saving. Considering AFib affects as many as 33.5 million people globally and can be difficult to detect, I&#8217;m very thankful that this is included in old Fitbit devices and working out of the box on the newer Fitbit Versa 4, Fitbit Sense 2, and Fitbit Inspire 3.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

It took some recurring lower back pain for the point to sink in, as it became readily evident that stretching everything above, below, behind, beside, and next-door-neighbors-to my lower back would begin to help alleviate the pain there.\nHamstrings, more than perhaps any other part of the body, are the muscles that help unlock the rest of the ones we have. They don’t just power their leg, they unlock the back, allowing for the kind of torque the body needs to produce any sort of athletic move, let alone swinging a big wooden bat at triple-digit speedballs. So, when Jonathan India became one of the many Cincinnati Reds bitten by the early-season hamstring bug, it was unfortunately little surprise to see him struggle for his best form after that hamstring once again got ‘healthy.’\nYou can swing a bat while recovering from a strained one, but you can’t swing a bat - not like you’re used to doing. While nothing else on the body hurts, a bum hammy restricts the kind of motion you’re used to all over, making finding one’s swing and timing damn hard to do until the hammy is back to full speed. He struggled with just having it feel well enough during his multiple flare-ups in April, and despite being shut down for over a month to get over that spell, his initial return once back in the lineup on June 14th was just about as rusty as one would expect.\nIn his first 23 games after returning ‘for good,’ he hit a miserable .170/.253/.267, his power not only sapped but so, too, his plate discipline. He walked just 3 times in those games against 25 strikeouts, indicative of a player who was searching for the swing he’d been able to count upon and simply being unable to find the balance needed for it to work.\nFortunately, however, the Cincinnati 2B got enough healthy reps in to rediscover it, thanks in part to the team’s patience with him during an already lost season for the entire club. That’s precisely what frustrating years like this are designed to do, though - allow the players you want to be a part of big things down the road to work through some issues with little on the line, and for India, that meant the opportunity to fix himself on a day to day basis. \nFix himself he has. After bottoming out at a .564 OPS after the game played on July 9th, India found another gear, and has returned to the precise combination of patience, power, and contact that led him to the 2021 National League Rookie of the Year award. The subsequent 42 games has seen him rake to the tune of .304/.385/.509 across 182 PA, numbers that echo his lift-off during last season once he was moved to the leadoff spot for good (.274/.382/.480 over 470 PA after June 5th). His .387 wOBA since July 10th ranks as the 16th best in all of baseball in that time among qualified hitters, just a few clicks behind Juan Soto (.391) and ahead of Jose Altuve (.384).\nWith the only guaranteed money on the Cincinnati books at the moment being the final-year contracts for Joey Votto and Mike Moustakas in 2023, it’s once again worth pointing out that the Reds are going to need to commit to someone, something to be the centerpiece of their franchise if they’re ever going to both a) win games again and b) convince fans to invest themselves emotionally in the well-being of the franchise. They need a cornerstone, at least if they’re to operate in a way at all familiar to the generations of fans who have supported them to this point. While India was struggling early on this year, it was worth wondering if the hamstring was just a subplot for a bit of a sophomore slump.\nWhat we’ve seen from him since getting healthy again, however, is the same kind of player who took the city by storm last year en route to his RoY win. That’s the kind of player you lock up with a contract extension, something even the most frugal of baseball owners must recognize. \nWelcome back, Jonathan. Let’s hope they find a way to keep you around like this for a long, long time.",

        "description": "The man who wrote a popular tongue-in-cheek guide to Minnesota culture has died. Howard Mohr&#x27;s &quot;How to Talk Minnesotan&quot; was considered a classic of Minnesota humor. He was 83. Mohr was a former professor at Southwest State University (now Southwest Minnesota State University) in Marshall, where poets Bill Holm and Stephen Dunn also taught. Mohr was a writer for the Prairie Home Companion radio show during the zenith of its run in the 1980s. He compiled some of the skits he had written and performed and published “How to Talk Minnesotan: a Visitor&#x27;s Guide” in 1987 to great acclaim, detailing the subtle meanings of phrases like &quot;You bet,&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s different.&quot;The book eventually became a musical, a public television special and got an update in 2013. Mohr lived for decades in southwestern Minnesota outside the town of Cottonwood. He died Sunday at the Prairie Home Fieldcrest Assisted Living Center in Cottonwood, with his family at his side. He is survived by his wife Jody, and their daughter Susan. Funeral services have not yet been scheduled.",

        "description": "Are new technologies like blockchain good ways to trace foods through their supply chain during food contamination outbreaks? New research pokes holes in that idea.\nFood contamination outbreaks are regular occurrences in the United States food system and can be costly. In 2006, for example, 276 consumer illnesses and three deaths were attributed to an E. coli outbreak in California, during which spinach disappeared from supermarket shelves nationwide for two weeks and the state&#8217;s farmers incurred losses of $74 million.\nTo protect themselves and their customers, retailers such as Walmart have been promoting blockchain as a novel method for tracing perishable foods such as leafy greens as they travel through the supply chain.\nBut what is the impact of such traceability technology, particularly on the strategic behaviors of stakeholders within the supply chain, and does it make good on its promises to increase safety and reduce waste? The answer, Fasheng Xu, professor of supply chain, operations, and technology at Syracuse University and his colleagues found in their theoretical model, is complex and depends on the configuration of the supply chain.\nThe greatest benefit of blockchain in this context is immediately apparent: Its ability to capture, maintain, and grant access to data along the supply chain makes it fast and efficient to pinpoint where contaminated spinach or other produce came from, allowing the continued sale of unaffected products. (The researchers call this the &#8220;pure traceability effect.&#8221;)\nConsidering the different stakeholders within the supply chain—retailers, suppliers, and farmers—complicates the picture. &#8220;They&#8217;re self-interested, and playing games with one another to try and maximize their profit,&#8221; Xu explains. &#8220;Their strategic actions may backfire and may not lead to win-win-win but to a triple loss.&#8221; (This is termed the &#8220;strategic-pricing effect.&#8221;)\nFor example, Walmart may strategically reduce the wholesale price for spinach, leading distributors to offer a lower procurement price to farmers. &#8220;The direct result is that the farmers are going to put less effort into improving supply chain safety, so as a result contamination risks will become higher after this technology adoption,&#8221; Xu says. The system and its individual supply chain members, including the retailer, end up worse off.\nHaving a greater number of farmers in the system, however, eventually allows the benefits of pure traceability to surpass the strategic-pricing effect. &#8220;When we have so many farmers, it becomes more valuable to quickly identify which farm the contamination was coming from, because otherwise we need to destroy the produce from all the farmers,&#8221; Xu explains.\nIn practice, the researchers recommend managers lock in the pricing system when traceability technology is put in place to discourage supply chain members from using strategic pricing and ensure that the benefits of the new system are distributed equally. &#8220;Walmart can make a commitment to the upstream suppliers saying that after they&#8217;ve adopted this technology, it&#8217;s not going to change the wholesale price,&#8221; Xu says.\nIn fact, perfect traceability may not even be the best solution. &#8220;There are many different ways to offer alternative risk mitigation measures, such as safety inspections in the middle of the supply chain,&#8221; Xu says. The study&#8217;s model, however, only applies to this specific case of perishable produce, he makes sure to emphasize. &#8220;If you look into other types of supply chains, like vehicle parts, it&#8217;s a different story.&#8221;\nCoauthors of the study are from the John M. Olin School of Business at Washington University in St. Louis. A paper on the findings is forthcoming in the journal Management Science.\nSource: Syracuse University\nThe post Could blockchain help track outbreaks like E. coli in spinach? appeared first on Futurity.",

        "link": "https://www.royalsreview.com/2022/9/6/23339010/remembering-mark-littell",
        "description": "Photo by: Diamond Images/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Thank God for the Country Boy The Royals, and the baseball world, lost one of the great ones on Monday. Mark Littell, who pitched for the Royals from 1973 to 1977 and for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1978 to 1982, passed away from complications of heart surgery at the age of 69. Littell, who was affectionately known as “Country”, and later “Ramrod”, was drafted by the Royals in the 12th round of the 1971 draft. \nLittell had been a star pitcher in the Gideon, Missouri area prior to being selected by the Royals. Littell shot through the Royals minor league system, spending the 1971 season in Rookie ball at Billings and the 1972 season at Class A Waterloo (IA.). After a strong camp, he started 1973 at AAA Omaha before being called up to Kansas City and making his debut on June 14th with a start at Baltimore. He was in Kansas City for good by 1975, part of the Royals youth movement that led to three consecutive Western Division titles. \nHis best season as a pro came in 1976, when he went 8-4 with a sparkling 2.08 ERA. He made 60 appearances that summer, throwing 104 innings while leading the Royals with 16 saves. He entered games to the John Denver song, Thank God I’m a Country Boy, while tens of thousands of fans sang along.  Much like his nickname, there was nothing fancy about Littell’s approach to pitching.  A classic fireballer, he gave you his best stuff with every pitch.  Hum baby, rock and fire.\nHe only gave up two home runs that 1976 season. The first came on July 10th to Pedro Garcia, a light-hitting second baseman for the Detroit Tigers. The second home run was one of the more infamous home runs in Royals history, the Chris Chambliss 9th inning ALCS walk-off. \nI’d asked Mark once about that home run and he said, “I felt good coming out of the pen, but the fans started throwing crap on the field and by the time they got it all cleared off, I’d gotten a little chilly. I threw him (Chambliss) a high fastball and he went up and got it!” Video shows the pitch was high, probably a ball, but no matter. It sent the Yankees to the World Series. Littell, who never met a stranger, harbored no ill feelings about the home run. He gave it his best, as did Chambliss and that’s just how it turned out. \nAfter the 1977 season, the Royals sent Littell and catcher Buck Martinez to St. Louis for their closer, Al Hrabosky. While Hrabosky struggled at times in Kansas City, Littell fit right in with the Cardinals, which were basically his hometown team. He had a stellar year in 1979, finishing 9-4 with 13 saves in 63 appearances and a 2.19 ERA.  On August 10th, 1981, Pete Rose singled off Mark for his 3,631st career hit, which was good for the National League record. \n\n  \n        \n      July 1977\n  \n\nCountry retired after the 1982 season ended, doing what very few athletes do: he went out on top. The Cardinals, led by former Royals skipper Whitey Herzog, won the World Series in 1982, besting the Milwaukee Brewers in seven games. Another former Royal, the late Darrell Porter, was the MVP of that series. The Cardinals held a 40-year anniversary reunion for that team on August 13th at Busch Stadium, and Country was there, telling stories and cracking jokes. I last spoke with him on August 18th, when he messaged me about his surgery, and I wished him the best on a speedy recovery. Like many others, I was 100% certain that he would sail through the surgery and come out wisecracking. \nAfter baseball, Mark wore many hats. He did some coaching, including a stint in Australia. He invented a cup called the Nutty Buddy, which has enjoyed some success. One of the best ways to remember the essence of Mark is to watch the YouTube video of him promoting the Nutty Buddy. I cringe every time I see him take a shot from the pitching machine.  The video is pure Country: Mark, wearing compression shorts, goggles and some sort of funny helmet, balanced on a wooden crate and two Gatorade jugs, full of confidence and bravado, and funny as hell. The second Nutty Buddy video is much more scientific and slicker but still just as funny as Mark takes a 90 MPH pitch from six feet away. He doesn’t even flinch. \n\n\nMark also wrote three books, telling stories of growing up in the Bootheel of Missouri and of his major league adventures. The books: On the 8th day, God made Baseball; What’s up Ramrod; and Country Boy: Conveniently Wild are must-reads for baseball fans. \nOne thing that made Mark different was his ability to connect to just about anyone, from the young men he coached to the casual fan and to his teammates. His enthusiasm was contagious, and Mark made everyone he met a better person.  He was a rare bird who had the ability to connect with everyone, from Hall of Fame teammates to casual fans to lowly scribes.  \nMix in a strike Country. Better yet, mix in an out. Mark is survived by his wife Sanna and more friends than one can count.  Mark Littell, gone too soon at the age of 69.",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Thomas Trutschel/Getty Images)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIreland’s data regulator has fined Instagram 405 million euro for violating the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation and failing to safeguard children’s information.\nThe fine from the Data Protection Commission followed a two-year investigation into the Meta-owned social media platform. The investigation covered complaints that Instagram defaulted the accounts of all users, including those under the age of 18, to public settings. It also related to how the contact information of children using business accounts on the platform was publicly available.\nInstagram, which allows users over the age of 13, said the fine related to old settings that were updated more than a year ago. It said it had released features to keep teenagers’ information private, including automatically setting children’s accounts to private when they sign up since July last year.Read 13 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

(credit: NASA)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalf a year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the implications of this war for the European space industry have been profound. Most notably, Europe has severed all connections with the Russian launch industry and canceled a joint mission to place a European rover on Mars with the help of a Russian rocket and lander.\nThe process of unwinding the deep links between Europe's space program and the Russian space industry have fallen largely on the shoulders of an Austrian space researcher named Josef Aschbacher, who had been director general of the European Space Agency for less than a year when Russia's tanks began rolling into Ukraine.\n\nLike most Europeans, he was aghast at what he saw. \"Look at what is happening on the ground,\" he said in an interview with Ars. \"I'm really disgusted by the invasion of Ukraine. We see it every single day. What is happening there is not meeting our European values, and we cannot work with a partner who is completely trampling on those values.\"Read 9 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge / The northern kōura (Paranephrops planifrons), or freshwater crayfish, is both economically and culturally significant to the indigenous Māori people of New Zealand. (credit: Cultura RM Exclusive/Richard Robinson)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreshwater crayfish have inhabited New Zealand for millions of years. They have dark, hard, and mottled shells, allowing them to blend in with logs and mud as they seek cover from predators. At night the crustaceans search for food, their strong pincers finding and cutting up fish, mayflies, plants, and snails. They are known here as kōura, a name given to them by the Māori, the Indigenous Polynesian people who first arrived in New Zealand in the 1300s and who now comprise more than 15 percent of the country’s population.\nFor Māori, the crayfish are economically and culturally significant, both as a delicacy and as part of a traditional value called mahinga kai, which upholds the importance of natural foods, their ecosystems, and the practices of gathering and sustaining them.\nToday, kōura populations are on the decline and are considered at risk of becoming threatened due to habitat loss, overfishing, and poor water quality. Makarini Rupene, a mahinga kai expert and cultural land management adviser with the local government of Canterbury, has watched this decline in the country’s South Island. “I was brought up fishing on the rivers, the lakes, the coastline, the ocean,” he said. As a child in the 1970s and ’80s, he learned traditional practices and their relationship with mahinga kai. Now when he returns to the waters of his childhood, he finds few crayfish.Read 19 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

By and large, they are intentionally unremarkable, with straightforward (and sometimes boxy) frames and unassuming black finishes.\nSo when Lenovo departs from this basic template, as it has for the new ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1, it's worth talking about. The Z13 is recognizable as a ThinkPad, but it has eccentric flourishes like brushed gold accents and a vegan leather lid. There's also a less-flashy gray aluminum version, if a business laptop with gold accents and vegan leather feels less \"stylish\" and more \"dad's midlife crisis\" to you.\nHands-down the most impressive thing about the Z13 is its Ryzen 6000 CPU and integrated Radeon GPU. I began testing the Z13 at around the same time as I was being underwhelmed by the 12th-generation Intel processors in the Framework Laptop and Lenovo's own X1 Carbon Gen 10, and the Ryzen CPU is just better than Intel's by just about any conceivable metric. But my reaction to the laptop that has been built around this chip is more reserved.Read 22 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge / Nature wants us to reproduce, so how come celibacy evolved? (credit: Carsten ten Brink/Flickr)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy would someone join an institution that removed the option of family life and required them to be celibate? Reproduction, after all, is at the very heart of the evolution that shaped us. Yet many religious institutions around the world require exactly this. The practice has led anthropologists to wonder how celibacy could have evolved in the first place.\nSome have suggested that practices that are costly to individuals, such as never having children, can still emerge when people blindly conform to norms that benefit a group—since cooperation is another cornerstone of human evolution. Others have argued that people ultimately create religious (or other) institutions because it serves their own selfish or family interest, and reject those who do not get involved.\nNow our new study, published in Royal Society Proceedings B and conducted in Western China, tackles this fundamental question by studying lifelong religious celibacy in Tibetan Buddhist monasteries.Read 13 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change-related anxiety has been on the rise in recent years, particularly among younger individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers sought to determine to what extent these worries could spur individuals to take action against the crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey found that eco-anxiety can lead to some positive lifestyle changes aimed at reducing individuals’ carbon footprint.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deluge of climate change-related headlines can lead to anxiety in some readers worried about the fate of the planet. But new research suggests some who experience climate anxiety are more motivated to carry out climate conscious actions in their own lives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWriting in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, a team of researchers from the University of Bath in the United Kingdom found “climate anxiety may not necessarily be a negative impact of, or maladaptive response to, climate change; but rather, at least to some degree, be a motivating force for effective action.” \n\n\n\nThe American Psychological Association defines climate anxiety or eco-anxiety as concern about climate change coupled with worry about the future, which leads to “fear, anger, feelings of powerlessness, exhaustion, stress and sadness.”\n\n\n\nPrevious research has found the condition is more common among young individuals. \n\n\n\nIn the current study, researchers conducted an online survey in late 2020 and in 2022 among 1,338 individuals from the U.K. public. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly half of those surveyed (46.2 percent) said they were very or extremely worried about climate change. In 2022, 4.6 percent of respondents had climate anxiety, compared with 4 percent in 2020. Eco-anxiety was more common among younger participants and those with higher generalized anxiety.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn addition, data showed higher climate anxiety was predictive of higher frequency of some pro-environmental behaviors like encouraging others to save energy, buying second-hand items, borrowing or renting items and repurposing items, authors wrote, noting these actions entail a degree of effort compared with more easily achieved actions like avoiding wasting food. \n\n\n\nOther green consumer decisions like cutting down on red meat, which has been shown to be highly effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, were not associated with climate anxiety.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFurthermore, individual experiences with climate change-related natural disasters were not predictive of climate anxiety. Instead, researchers found media exposure, like images of storms or heat waves on television, was more predictive of eco-anxiety.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“With increasing media coverage of climate impacts, such as droughts and fires in the UK and devastating flooding in Pakistan, climate anxiety may well increase,” said study co-author Lorraine Whitmarsh, an environmental psychologist  at the University of Bath in a statement. \n\n\n\n“Our findings suggest this can spur some people to take action to help tackle the issue – but we also know there are barriers to behavior change that need to be addressed through more government action,” Whitmarsh added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe authors conclude the media plays an important role when it comes to influencing perceptions of climate change and eco-anxiety.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Clarifying what sorts of media content and channels trigger or exacerbate climate anxiety would be a helpful step for future research,” they wrote.&nbsp;",

Nominally directed at “divisive” concepts,&nbsp;most of the bills&nbsp;effectively prohibit or penalize factual discussion of structural or&nbsp;pervasive&nbsp;racism in American history.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSeptember marks the anniversary of one of the most dramatic challenges to white supremacy in the years before the Civil War — an event that could not be accurately taught under many of the anti-CRT statutes pending or already in force.\n\n\n\nIn late summer 1858, John Price was living quietly in Oberlin, Ohio. A refugee from enslavement in Kentucky, Price felt safe in Oberlin, then the most racially progressive community in the U.S. The eponymous college, founded in 1833, was among the first in the nation to welcome Black students, and the community had grown more staunchly abolitionist over the years. The town clerk was John Mercer Langston, the first Black municipal official in the U.S.\n\n\n\nOberlin naturally attracted fugitives such as Price, but that also made the town a magnet for slave hunters, who ranged across Ohio seeking vulnerable African Americans, with little regard to whether they were legally free or runaways.\n\n\n\nPrice was recognized – rightly or pretextually – by a slave hunter named Anderson Jennings, who anticipated a $500 reward for returning him to Kentucky. Early on Sept. 13, armed with a warrant under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, Jennings and three henchmen lured Price out of town, overpowered him and hustled him into a buggy nearby headed to Wellington, where they planned to catch a train to Columbus for a perfunctory hearing, and then southward to Kentucky.\n\n\n\nThe abduction was conducted under the full authority of the U.S. government. The Fugitive Slave Act had been part of the Compromise of 1850, passed at the behest of the southern slavocrats who virtually controlled Congress, the presidency and the courts. The statute’s sham hearing procedure was designed to make it nearly impossible for a suspected fugitive to resist rendition to the South. There was no right to a jury or appeal, and the alleged fugitives were not permitted to testify in their own defense. The presiding commissioners were paid $10 for granting a “certificate of removal” but only $5 for releasing an alleged runaway. Interfering with the capture of a fugitive was a federal felony. Lacking any semblance of due process, the Fugitive Slave Act was a model of structural racism if ever there was one.\n\n\n\nReaching Wellington in early afternoon, the kidnappers waited for the 5:00 p.m. train at a nearby hotel. Unknown to the slave catchers, however, an Oberlin abolitionist had seen them seizing Price, and he raised an alarm in the village square.\n\n\n\nMore than 100 Oberliners, both Black and white, rushed to Wellington, where they surrounded the hotel. The posse retreated to the attic, hoping to wait out the siege, while waving their warrant as protection under law.\n\n\n\nTo the Oberliners, the warrant was worthless paper. Two groups of young men – again, Black and white together – climbed to the attic and overwhelmed the slave hunters. They carried Price to a waiting wagon that sped him to Oberlin, where celebratory speeches were delivered at a bonfire rally.\n\n\n\nAfter a few days in hiding, Price was escorted to Canada by John Anthony Copeland, a young Black man and former Oberlin student who (as I detail in my book&nbsp;\"The 'Colored Hero' of Harpers Ferry: John Anthony Copeland and the War against Slavery\") would soon fight and die with John Brown in Virginia.\n\n\n\nPresident James Buchanan, a pro-slavery “doughface,” was outraged by the bold resistance to federal law. He personally ordered a sweeping prosecution, at one point considering the death penalty for treason. Ultimately, 37 rescuers – including 12 African Americans – were indicted for violating the Fugitive Slave Act, and held for trial before the U.S. District Court in Cleveland.\n\n\n\nThe trial was a landmark in American legal history. The rescuers acknowledged violating the Fugitive Slave Act but argued for acquittal under a “higher law.” Civil disobedience in the face of slave hunting had long been preached in pulpits and the streets, but never before had it been raised in court. The jury should refuse to convict, asserted one defense lawyer, and should instead rejoice “over the escape of a brother man from bondage.”\n\n\n\nThe most significant defendant was the prominent Black abolitionist Charles Langston, an Oberlin graduate, John Mercer’s older brother and later the grandfather of the poet Langston Hughes. Following his inevitable conviction, Langston stunned the public with his defiant speech at sentencing, in which he declared his intention to continue rescuing fugitives from enslavement, without deference to the verdict of a racist court.\n\n\n\n“I know that the courts of this country are so constituted as to oppress and outrage colored men,” Langston began.&nbsp;“I cannot, then, expect, judging from the past history of the country, any mercy from the laws [or] from the Constitution.”\n\n\n\nHe vowed to assist those who had gained freedom, “by escaping from the plantations of their masters, eluding the blood-thirsty patrols and sentinels so thickly scattered all along their path, outrunning bloodhounds and horses, swimming rivers and fording swamps, and reaching at last, through incredible difficulties, what they, in their delusion, supposed to be free soil.\"\n\n\n\nThere is much more to the story of the Oberlin rescue, but it cannot be told without honestly acknowledging the Slave Power’s domination of the U.S. government from the founding of the Republic until the eve of the Civil War. That would evidently violate typical anti-CRT&nbsp;guidelines, which prohibit describing&nbsp; “American history as something other than the creation of a new nation based largely on universal principles stated in the Declaration of Independence.” \n\n\n\nBut the Fugitive Slave Act was not mistakenly enacted despite the nation’s principles. It was, as Charles Langston understood, the intentional institutionalization of white supremacy, under which a Black man had no rights.\n\n\n\nLangston’s prosecutor declared that “slaves were not fit for freedom” and castigated the rescuers for “outraging the law of the land.” In words disturbingly similar to&nbsp;today’s&nbsp;anti-CRT&nbsp;hysteria, he railed that “the students who attend that Oberlin College are taught sedition and treason.”\n\n\n\nThat was an overwrought exaggeration. The students at Oberlin were simply taught the truth about racism in a curriculum that we still need today.\n\n\n\nSteven&nbsp;Lubet&nbsp;is Williams Memorial Professor Emeritus at the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law and the author of&nbsp;“The ‘Colored Hero’ of Harpers Ferry: John Anthony Copeland and the War against Slavery”&nbsp;and&nbsp;“Fugitive Justice: Runaways, Rescuers, and Slavery on Trial.”",

The new Anker 511 Nano 3 charger is a 30-watt single USB-C charger that’s designed for fast charging an iPhone or iPad and can even power a MacBook Air — all with a charger that’s about the size of Apple’s old 5W charger it used to include with iPhones.\nJust like last year’s model, the Nano 3 is a gallium nitride (GaN) charger that can output more power from smaller and cooler packaging. It doesn’t use the company’s new GaNPrime tech introduced in July, but the Nano 3 does have foldable blades that make pocketing it less stabby.\n  \n        \n      Image: Anker\n  \nCompared to Apple’s 30W USB-C charger, the new Nano 3 is about 70 percent smaller, according to Anker.

It’s a long-held belief that Apple hides things inside its event invitations, but we wondered whether this search for secrets ever bore any fruit (sorry) — and if it did, what sort of hints there are.\nTo find out, we scoured every invitation over the past 21 years and compared them against the various products subsequently announced at each event. And it turns out, again and again, Apple buries clues in plain sight. But discerning their meaning is not so simple.

        "description": "Video essayist Thomas Flight examined how the sublime television series Better Call Saul used props, character response, location, and cinematography to visually show tell the story of Jimmy McGill&#8216;s transformation into Saul Goodman.\n\n\n\nWhat&#8217;s Better About Better Call Saul? In this video essay I take a look at the way Better Call Saul uses visual storytelling, to show instead of tell.\n\n\n\nFlight cites the use of an ice cream cone that Jimmy was forced to drop onto the street when cartel business unexpectedly took him away. He later returned to the same spot where ants had wholly consumed his discarded treat. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also talks about the trash can from the first season and the &#8220;World&#8217;s (Second) Best Lawyer&#8221; mug, which appeared regularly throughout the series.\n\n\n\nTo show instead of tell is perhaps best illustrated by Jimmy&#8217;s world&#8217;s best lawyer mug the mug was a regular feature in the early seasons and so the image of it shot through with a bullet is an evocative symbol of Jimmy slipping into Saul his movement into more dangerous territory and the death of a certain in image that Jimmy has of himself but then it also sets up this fantastic moment where we get to see Kim realize Jimmy is lying to her about what happened in the desert.",

        "description": "Photo by Julio Aguilar/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The former Rangers first baseman has been mashing in Triple-A in the second half. All of a sudden, the Yankees have become a little thin at first base. Anthony Rizzo, who missed a week at the beginning of August with a back issue, hasn’t made a start since August 30th with a reoccurrence of that same problem. Primary backup DJ LeMahieu has been dealing with injuries of his own, including toe problems that have sapped his strength. Matt Carpenter, the player with the third-most appearances at first, has been out since early August with broken bones in his foot. Marwin Gonzalez, the utilityman with three appearances at the cold corner ... well, let’s just face it, he hasn’t been very good. \nIf Rizzo misses any significant time with either the back injury or the epidural-induced headaches, the Yankees may need to look outside the 40-man roster for their first baseman down the stretch. Fortunately, there’s a decent option waiting in the wings down in Triple-A Scranton: Ronald Guzmán, who just so happens to have experience with homers at Yankee Stadium.\n\nThose who obsessively follow the Yankees even in spring training (as much as I do) might remember Guzmán, as he made some headlines as a non-roster invitee. Given No. 29 — a fairly low number for a player not on the 40-man roster — the 6-foot-5 left-handed first baseman made quite an impression in limited playing time, going 4-for-10 with a double, a walk, and five runs batted in. Although he was always destined for a ticket to Scranton with both Rizzo and LeMahieu ahead of him on the depth chart and in his first season after tearing his meniscus last April, he nonetheless showed that he could potentially fill in should the need arise.\nWell, with Rizzo’s lingering back problems (not to mention Giancarlo Stanton’s Achilles and foot issues), the time might just be ripe for the 27-year-old’s return to the big leagues. If that’s the case, it couldn’t come at a better time. The first three months of the season saw Guzmán mired in a massive slump, and as June gave way to July, he was slashing a pitiful .198/.311/.321 with just 4 home runs and 8 doubles in his first 54 games. Starting in July, he began to mash, posting a .367/.439/.612 triple slash with 2 homers and 6 doubles in just 15 games. In August and September, he has been even better: a .333/.413/.712 line with 6 home runs and 7 doubles in 20 games.\n\n\nGuzmán is the gift that keeps on giving  Ronald Guzmán tallies his SECOND homer of the night, and it's the go-ahead in the ninth! #RepBX #OffTheRails pic.twitter.com/qURA7PMKCo— SWB RailRiders (@swbrailriders) August 26, 2022\n\n\n\nOh, and Guzmán has been doing all this recent work while focusing not on his work at the plate, but on the mound, as he tries to leverage his 96-mph fastball to turn himself into baseball’s next two-way player.\nFurthermore, in addition to his hot-hitting bat, Guzmán would provide the Yankees with some defensive certainty at first if Rizzo misses significant time. In 226 games across four seasons with the Texas Rangers, he has been worth 7 Defensive Runs Saved, 4.2 UZR/150, and 0 Outs Above Average. While these numbers are not necessarily elite, first base defensive metrics are notoriously tricky, and his glove did earn a strong reputation among insiders. At a minimum, he’s a natural first baseman with a decent glove capable of competently receiving the throws from other infielders and saving a few errors along the way, which is all you can ask for.\nThe chances are that Guzmán will finish out the year down in Triple-A Scranton, continuing to keep up his strong finish at the plate and potentially making an appearance or two out of the bullpen to further his two-way development, as Rizzo is expected back tomorrow. Should the Yankees’ first baseman need to hit the injured list, however, or if the Yankees decide to try something else to ignite the underwhelming offense ... well, Guzmán could not have found his stroke at a better time.\nUpdate\n\n\nRonald Guzman says he hasn’t been told what his role will be. He received word that he was being called up last night. #Yankees— Justin Shackil (@JustinShackil) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nWelp, here we go.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/3630564-who-benefits-from-americas-enormously-complex-broadband-infrastructure-plans/",
        "description": "Even the most dedicated analyst can be forgiven for not understanding the scope of government efforts to promote U.S. broadband (sometimes called “high speed”) internet. Although President Biden frequently reiterates his commitment to every American being connected to high speed internet, even basic definitions of high speed internet vary considerably, much less such key concepts as who is/is not, already connected or which technologies are/are not sufficient for broadband internet? This is important because the Federal government has already spent around $44 billion to enable universal broadband and is projected to spend over $100 billion more (to say nothing of separate State, industry, local and charitable spending.)\n\n\n\nSome of this funding has resulted from closings during the pandemic, when schools, colleges, libraries, clinics, theaters and offices were closed and videoconferencing/streaming replaced nearly everything; however, some of the push for universal broadband goes back decades to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which for the first time expanded the Universal Service Fund to include the “Information Superhighway.”\n\n\n\nWhile assessments vary considerably, the GAO reported in May that 133 separate programs managed by 15 Federal agencies provide funding to support broadband connectivity, not including independent State programs. These programs provide funds for everything from a basic home broadband connection to subsidies for tribal/rural libraries. Four agencies, with distinct mandates, support the bulk of these programs: The FCC and the Departments of Commerce/NTIA, Agriculture/RUS and Treasury/CCPF, with lesser roles played by HHS, DOT, HUD and others.  \n\n\n\nEstimates and definitions of how many Americans currently have broadband also vary considerably, but the Pew Research Center asserts that in 2021 around 77 percent of Americans already used broadband in their homes. According to this same report, another 15 percent of Americans say they don’t have broadband at home, but use a smartphone instead. While smartphone-based internet is not the same thing as a fiber optic cable to one’s home, in some applications they are interchangeable. This will increase as urban smartphone users migrate to new, high-speed 5G cellular services at home and drop wired broadband.\n\n\n\nThe areas least served by broadband are rural — and especially tribal — for the primary reason that it’s expensive to run cables or build cellphone towers when homes, work, hospitals and schools are located far apart or mountains separate them. Historically, these areas have had limited wired (or smartphone-based) broadband, although geostationary (GEO) satellite-based broadband internet connections have technically been available in rural areas for decades. Since GEOs require users to have large, outdoor dish-antennas pointed toward the southern horizon and the satellites’ high altitudes result in a quarter-second signal delay, GEOs have been used mainly for point-to-point telecommunications, broadcast-type television or ships/aircraft at sea, not rural broadband.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA new generation of low Earth orbiting (LEO) satellites designed mainly for broadband has emerged over the past decade. LEOs rely on an enormous number of small satellites constantly passing overhead at lower altitudes. LEO users deploy smaller, flat antennas pointed upwards and experience comparatively modest signal delays. But the larger the number of LEO broadband users on the ground, the larger the number of small satellites needed to accommodate all those transmissions, so many operators plan constellations of many thousands of satellites, potentially creating international conflicts and congestion in the skies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Congressional Research Service identifies four principal U.S. LEO broadband service providers, of which Space X’s Starlink reportedly already has 500,000 broadband users linked to 2,200 small LEOs. While the Trump FCC approved a grant of $885 million to Starlink for mostly rural U.S. broadband, the Commission under the Biden administration reversed that grant, explaining that “Starlink’s technology has real promise … But the question before us was whether to publicly subsidize its still developing technology for consumer broadband.”\n\n\n\nAs if jurisdiction, goals, required features, necessary funding levels and appropriate technologies were not complex enough, for many in the broadband policy debates, the core issue is not the universal availability of broadband, but its affordability or its availability and affordability for targeted populations in greatest need. Targeted subsidies and outreach are important tools for these goals, although, paradoxically, Pew estimates that 7 percent of Americans who have broadband don’t use it.     \n\n\n\nThe U.S. broadband effort is massive and complex. Much of this confusing intricacy is unavoidable given the Federal structure, size and complexity of the United States and the fact that, today, almost everything in education, health care, farming, transportation, defense, employment, shopping, entertainment, civic affairs, the arts, regulation, banking and much more may involve broadband. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdding to this multi-layered complexity of goals, jurisdictions, technologies, terrains and commercial competition are rapidly changing technologies, independent State programs and, of course, politics. The potential for duplication, abuse and waste is sizeable. Setting clear priorities and goals and determining whether America is spending the right amount of the public’s money for the right broadband investments and subsidies is as important for those in need of broadband service as it is for taxpayers.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, the Congress enacted the Broadband Interagency Coordination Act requiring Commerce/NTIA, Agriculture/RUS and the FCC to better coordinate their separate broadband funding activities, and in June of 2021 these three agencies entered into an agreement to do so. In 2022, they entered into a further coordination agreement with Treasury (which provides broadband grants under Coronavirus Relief and State and Local Recovery programs.) And various, larger multiagency groups have been created to further interagency coordination. These are important steps to give some direction to a $100 billion sprawling, multiagency, Federal-State effort; but results will be measured when agencies cut back on something they would prefer to do in order to avoid duplication or waste.\n\n\n\nIn the end, the greatest beneficiaries of our $100+ billion universal broadband commitment are not just the eventual recipients of broadband service but the providers of internet-based services, including internet platforms, merchants, banks, streaming services, messaging services and many more. Entirely new markets will be opened for those who use the “Information Superhighway” for their business; their direct contributions to expanding universal affordable broadband remains less clear.\n\n\n\nRoger Cochetti provides consulting and advisory services in Washington, D.C.  He was a senior executive with Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT) from 1981 through 1994.

What Logan and Lenberg did inside is uncertain.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe two consultants have been involved in pursuing voting machines in multiple states, and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel (D) has requested a special prosecutor decide whether to back charging them for allegedly trying to illegally access election equipment in three counties in the state last year.\n\n\n\nLogan and Lenberg could not be reached by The Hill for comment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe surveillance footage was publicized as a result of a subpoena issued to Georgia elections officials in a lawsuit filed over the state’s election security.

        "description": "Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Atlanta Braves went a little off of most boards in making Owen Murphy their first round pick, but perhaps they found value in that pick While there was connection with Owen Murphy and the Atlanta Braves, very few people expected him to go 20th overall like he did in this past July’s draft. Since then he’s made his debut in a Braves uniform and quickly made his way up to Augusta and full season ball. Murphy was untouchable in the Florida Complex League, making two starts in which he didn’t allow a run or walk while striking out seven batters in five innings. He made a solid debut with Augusta by allowing one run over 2 2⁄3 innings, but in his second game had a blow up outing and couldn’t get out of the first inning.\nMurphy’s fastball sits in the low-90s and has touched 95 mph, and right now it is the pitch they are having him focus on developing. He has thrown 80%+ fastball in his two starts in Augusta and to some extent has gotten punished for it as that’s what Low-A hitters are chasing for. Murphy’s fastball doesn’t have that elite velocity and his frame doesn’t give reason to believe there is too much projection left, so the focus for the Braves is having him develop his command of the pitch. He doesn’t generate ride up in the zone either, so the pitch may have trouble missing bats against better hitters. Atlanta has still had him working nearly exclusively up in the zone, but Murphy’s fastball as it currently stands projects less as a pitch to use in strikeout situations.\n\n\npic.twitter.com/nmMmfWylzh— Garrett Spain (@BravesMILB) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nMurphy’s curveball was an immediately impressive pitch from the first use of it, and although he still struggles to land the pitch in good zones consistently the shape of the pitch is absolutely fantastic. While Murphy’s fastball isn’t elite it does create a pitch off of which his curveball can tunnel. Murphy’s bender is has a tight, sharp spin in a good plane off of his fastball and frequently fooled hitters when it was being utilized. Thrown around 8-10 miles per hour slower than the fastball it is hard to recognize for any of its characteristics and can be a go-to pitch in late counts. Murphy’s breaking ball is one of the better ones in the system already and will be the pitch that will ultimately determine how much he can succeed. Murphy hasn’t thrown a changeup yet that I have seen, so judgement will need to be reserved on that.\n\n\npic.twitter.com/ITppeXeeUs— Garrett Spain (@BravesMILB) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nMurphy has high-level athleticism and a relatively simple delivery, but as of now that doesn’t really seem to be showing up in his command. Murphy has a bit less experience than most being a two-way player and all of the tools are their for him to have good future command, but right now he fails to locate either his fastball or curveball well. Some players with all of the tools for command never manage to figure it out and that is a risk for Murphy, but if there is a player that can learn to command his fastball it would be one with Murphy’s profile.\nIt’s way too early and too small of a sample to make sweeping judgements on Murphy, but my first impression of him is that there is a good base of athleticism and a fantastic curveball to work with. Fastball command is and will be his primary focus and I don’t expect particularly quick advancement, but as he leans on the curveball and changeup more often we will hopefully see him put away hitters at a higher rate. We need to see the change up to really get a feel for who he is right now, but in terms of the movement metrics on his fastball and curveball he shows some similarity to current Braves starter Kyle Wright. He doesn’t have the velocity that Wright does and that may or may not ever develop, but his pitches at their highest quality have shown quite the promise. I don’t yet see Murphy as the type of high end talent that can really change a franchise, but I do see the basic steps towards him being a solid mid-rotation starter.",

        "description": "Erik Williams-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Unquantifiable value: It’s a thing. Measuring a player’s worth can be a tricky thing. Even with the troves of data available to the public, there are still cases where it’s difficult to assess how truly valuable a player is.\nMauricio Dubón may be one of those cases.\nOn the surface, it may seem fairly cut and dry. Dubón has a 0.2 fWAR in 222 plate appearances this year, and owns a .213/.259/.307 (60 wRC+) line with 4 home runs. Peripheral metrics indicate the 28-year-old utilityman is slightly underperforming, but for the most part, his output at the plate is poor.\nThough he frequently puts the ball in play (9.9 K%) and fares decently against left-handed pitching (career 110 wRC+), Dubón is rather limited with the bat. This is known. What’s also known — and is ostensibly the reason why the Astros traded for Dubón in May — is that the Honduran native is uniquely capable in the field.\nIn 2022, Dubón is the only player in baseball to have made at least 15 appearances at each of the three up-the-middle positions. He’s appeared 46 times in center field, 18 at shortstop and 16 at second base. It’s made him a real asset from a roster standpoint — especially because he’s a quality defender at all three spots, based on both the eye test and metrics such as OAA and DRS.\nCovering three premium positions on the diamond is one thing, it’s another to do so in more than just passable fashion. This ability is why Dubón has carved out a notable role on the American League’s best team, his anemic offensive production notwithstanding.\nIt’s another instance of where the Astros, one of the most forward-thinking, analytically-savvy organizations in the league, place value in a player that doesn’t appear to be a meaningful contributor from an analytics perspective, specifically that of WAR. While it’s widely considered to be a legitimate metric when it comes to measuring a player’s total value, WAR is not the end-all be-all. A gray area that consists of things like intangibles and versatility (coupled with roster flexibility) is something that cannot be measured precisely.\nExhibit A of that sentiment is Martín Maldonado, who has a 0.1 fWAR since 2021, and has never been at risk of losing his starting job.\nIf there is one player in baseball who makes a truly unquantifiable impact on his team, it’s Maldonado. Without comparing Dubón to Maldonado, a case could be made that Dubón’s value to the roster is similar to that of the effect that Maldonado has on a game from behind the dish. It’s not tangible nor abstract, but something in between.\nBaseball is continually evolving, and front offices are typically the driving force behind it. Along with a few others, the Astros’ FO has been at the sport’s forefront for several years now. Though the leadership was overhauled in 2020 in the wake of the sign-stealing scandal, the philosophical principals of the prior administration largely remain. \nPlayers like Dubón and Maldonado aren’t going to be the building blocks of a club, but — to varying degrees — they’re important role players. In this era of quantified evaluation, identifying the Dubóns and the Maldonados of the game seems to be a goal of sorts for the Astros. There’s bucking the trend, and then there’s bucking the trend you helped revolutionize.\nAs Brad Pitt said in 2011’s ‘Moneyball’: Adapt or die.",

        "description": "She staged an event even Duchamp said was messy, filmed herself having sex, unrolled a script from her vagina – and took art away from canvas and into the stuff of life itselfCarolee Schneemann was born in 1939 in Pennsylvania, USA. Her father, a doctor, gave her an early introduction to the body and its viscera. She received a scholarship to Bard College at 16 and left to study in New York, ending up at Columbia. “I had never found a precedent of woman artists in the art history books that were available to me,” Schneemann said in 2017.Schneemann worked for many years honing her multimedia practice. This included performances, film, photography and painting, exemplified by the 1963 photo series Eye Body: 36 Transformative Actions for the Camera, in which she photographed herself naked and covered in paint, glue, fur, snakes and feathers, at once the seer and the seen.

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/mlbpa-requests-mlb-recognize-minor-league-union-nlrb-election.html",
        "description": "The Major League Baseball Players Association announced Tuesday morning that a &#8220;significant&#8221; majority of minor leaguers have signed authorization cards in favor of the MLBPA creating a minor league bargaining unit. The MLBPA has formally requested that MLB recognize its new effort to represent minor leaguers. Evan Drellich of The Athletic first reported that the union had received majority support from minor leaguers on the matter and requested voluntary recognition from MLB.\nThe MLBPA first sent authorization cards to minor league players last week &#8212; a first step toward unionizing minor league players who have previously lacked the representation and collective bargaining capabilities enjoyed by Major League players.  If MLB chooses not to acknowledge the the MLBPA as the new bargaining unit for minor league players, the MLBPA can (and surely will) file a motion with the federal National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). That will prompt an election among the minor league players, and if there&#8217;s a majority among those who vote in that election, the NLRB would subsequently require Major League Baseball to recognize the MLBPA as the bargaining unit of minor league players.\nIt&#8217;s another notable step in what appears to be a fast-moving process. MLB has yet to comment on the unionization effort whatsoever, so it remains wholly unclear when or whether the league will provide a response. The MLBPA can push forward and pursue an NLRB-prompted election at any time, so if commissioner Rob Manfred and his team continue to remain silent on the matter, the union can still advance the process. An MLBPA official told MLBTR last week that the proposed unionization efforts would give minor leaguers their own separate bargaining unit under the MLBPA umbrella, adding that any minor league CBA would be negotiated independently of the Major League CBA that was completed earlier this year.\n&#8220;Minor league Players have made it unmistakably clear they want the MLBPA to represent them and are ready to begin collective bargaining in order to positively affect the upcoming season,&#8221; MLBPA executive director Tony Clark said in a statement released Tuesday morning.\nDrellich&#8217;s piece contains quotes from several minor league players on the matter and notes that there would still be some hurdles regarding the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League, as the league is not based in the United States. Still, Drellich emphasizes that the players union has told minor leaguers that it plans to attempt to bargain over the working conditions of DSL players as well.\nThe move to add the majority of minor league players to the MLBPA ranks would see union membership skyrocket from 1,200 &#8212; the 40 players on the 40-man rosters of all 30 MLB teams &#8212; to more than 5,000. The MLBPA has already bulked up its staff in preparation for the move, announcing last week that it had hired every employee from Advocates for Minor Leaguers as a new full-time employee of the MLBPA.\nCurrently, neither the salaries nor benefits of minor league players are collectively bargained. Minor league players are only paid during the season, and their minimum salaries range from $400 per week in the lower levels &#8212; where seasons are only three months long &#8212; to $700 per week in Triple-A (via the Associated Press).",

        "description": "Enlarge / Did you know that Abraham Lincoln was a cowboy? Stable Diffusion does. (credit: Benj Edwards / Stable Diffusion)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI image generation is here in a big way. A newly released open source image synthesis model called Stable Diffusion allows anyone with a PC and a decent GPU to conjure up almost any visual reality they can imagine. It can imitate virtually any visual style, and if you feed it a descriptive phrase, the results appear on your screen like magic.\nSome artists are delighted by the prospect, others aren't happy about it, and society at large still seems largely unaware of the rapidly evolving tech revolution taking place through communities on Twitter, Discord, and Github. Image synthesis arguably brings implications as big as the invention of the camera—or perhaps the creation of visual art itself. Even our sense of history might be at stake, depending on how things shake out. Either way, Stable Diffusion is leading a new wave of deep learning creative tools that are poised to revolutionize the creation of visual media.\nThe rise of deep learning image synthesis\nStable Diffusion is the brainchild of Emad Mostaque, a London-based former hedge fund manager whose aim is to bring novel applications of deep learning to the masses through his company, Stability AI. But the roots of modern image synthesis date back to 2014, and Stable Diffusion wasn't the first image synthesis model (ISM) to make waves this year.Read 22 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

Twelve national teams, split evenly between the two sites, will be vying for four tickets to the 2023 World Baseball Classic. \nIn Regensburg, host nation Germany will face off in a double-elimination tournament against the Czech Republic, France, Great Britain, South Africa and Spain. In Panama City, the host Panamanians will take on Argentina, Brazil, New Zealand, Nicaragua and Pakistan.\nIn the first round in Germany, South Africa will face Spain and Great Britain will take on France. The winners of those two games will go on to play the Czech Republic and Germany, both of which received a first-round bye in the qualifiers. The losers will go to the loser’s bracket in the double-elimination tournament.\nLater in Panama, New Zealand will play Brazil and Argentina will be opposed by Pakistan. Panama and Nicaragua have the two byes in that qualifier. \nArgentina is competing in WBC qualifying for the first time. \nAll 16 teams that qualified for the 2017 tournament have automatically qualified for next year’s WBC. A record twenty nations will compete in the 2023 World Baseball Classic main tournament.\nAll WBC qualifying games will be broadcast on MLB.com, at Worldbaseballclassic.com and on the World Baseball Classic’s Facebook and YouTube pages. \nThe World Baseball Softball Confederation, the official world governing body for baseball and softball, considers the World Baseball Classic to be the official “World Championship” of baseball. So it should be a big deal. \nI know that some of you love the WBC, some of you hate it and some of you don’t care one way or the other, but the WBC is the most important event for spreading the popularity of baseball worldwide. It means a lot to some of these emerging baseball markets to even be on the same field with the stars of the United States, the Dominican Republic, and Japan. That can lead to increased funding and support from national sporting federations, which then grows the game worldwide.",

        "description": "The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s editorial board said that Pennsylvania Senate Republican nominee Mehmet Oz has raised “legitimate concerns” about his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, in an editorial published Tuesday. \n\n\n\nThe editorial comes a week after Fetterman announced that he would not participate in a debate with Oz during the first week of September, citing his recovery from a stroke he had in May and statements from Oz’s campaign that Fetterman has said mocked him for having the stroke. \n\n\n\n“If Mr. Fetterman is not well enough to debate his opponent, that raises serious concerns about his ability to serve as a United States senator,” the editorial states.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFetterman told the Post-Gazette in July that he felt “really good” following the stroke and has no “physical limits.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe editorial states Fetterman’s campaign has acknowledged lingering struggles with speech but asserts that he will fully recover and is taking the necessary steps to do so in speech therapy. It states that a live debate is the best way to determine if Fetterman is up to the job of senator.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe editorial board endorsed former President Trump for reelection in 2020, its first time endorsing a Republican for president since 1972. Trump endorsed Oz's campaign in the spring.\n\n\n\nThe board said the legitimate point about Fetterman’s health does not excuse the tactics that Oz’s campaign has pursued in deciding that Oz will benefit from “dragging the race deeper and deeper into the muck.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFetterman’s stroke –– which he had in May shortly before winning the Democratic primary –– gained additional attention in the general election campaign after an Oz spokesperson said in a statement to Insider that Fetterman may not have had a stroke if he “had ever eaten a vegetable in his life.” \n\n\n\nOz’s senior communications adviser made the statement in response to criticism Oz received for a campaign video in which he complained about rising grocery prices making crudité more expensive. His campaign later released a mocking statement in which it noted “concessions” that it would make if Fetterman agreed to a debate, like paying for “additional medical personnel” that Fetterman might need “on standby.” \n\n\n\nFetterman said Oz has made “abundantly clear that they think it is funny to mock a stroke survivor” and that he would be ready to discuss debating Oz when Oz and his team “are ready to take this seriously.” \n\n\n\nThe Post-Gazette said Oz has attempted to distance himself from his campaign’s statements but that spokespeople speak for his campaign and he should fire them if they have “gone rogue.” But the editorial said he can note legitimate concerns about Fetterman being straightforward with his health without “sandbox bullying.”",

        "description": "There are as many versions of the American Dream as there are Americans willing to dream them. As such, our labor laws should empower the nation’s workers to chart their own course to prosperity, not bind them into restrictive, one-size-fits-all arrangements which reduce their options and limit their potential.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Washington Democrats are fixated on dragging us back to an outdated model which would strip workers of their freedoms and force every American worker to either join a union or pay dues to a union in order to keep their jobs.\n\n\n\nIf this sounds like an exaggeration, it’s not. This provision is central to the Democrats’&nbsp;Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which seeks to eliminate the Right-to-Work laws currently on the books in 27 states — including my home state of Georgia.\n\n\n\nGiven the disruptive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (and the subsequent growth of the gig economy), it is clear that workers want&nbsp;more&nbsp;flexibility in their work arrangements, not less.\n\n\n\nThat’s why I’ve teamed up with Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) to introduce the&nbsp;Employee Rights Act. Our legislation defends workers from union intimidation, protects small businesses from harmful regulations, and it preserves the unique arrangements of gig workers, independent contractors, entrepreneurs, and anyone else seeking the flexibility to make their dreams a reality on their own terms.\n\n\n\nWhile the&nbsp;PRO Actonly serves the narrow interests of union bosses and their allies in Congress, the&nbsp;Employee Rights Actprovides a roadmap for an economy that puts workers first.\n\n\n\nYou may wonder why Washington Democrats are pushing so hard for this proposal at a time when union membership is dwindling. Truthfully, it has more to do with politics than policy.\n\n\n\nWhenever a union employee receives their paycheck, a certain amount is deducted as part of their membership dues. Current labor laws allow union bosses to donate this money to support political candidates and advocacy groups, all without the worker’s approval or knowledge.\n\n\n\nIn the last 10 years, unions have&nbsp;donated&nbsp;more than $1 billion of workers’ dues to political campaigns. On average, 88 percent of these funds went to support Democrat candidates, even though roughly 43 percent of union households&nbsp;vote&nbsp;for Republicans.\n\n\n\nTo the politicians pushing the&nbsp;PRO Act, the calculus is simple: more union members equal more money to pad their campaign coffers — never mind the egregious privacy concerns this raises.\n\n\n\nImagine for a moment that your workplace started collecting money for a company picnic. Those who didn’t want to come to the picnic had no obligation to contribute, but those attending were asked to donate money to help cover the cost. Then imagine you discover the person in charge of that money was using it for their own benefit. Would you still contribute?\n\n\n\nNow imagine the company&nbsp;forced&nbsp;you to contribute whether you were going to the picnic or not. If you refused, you could be fired or have your personal information shared with people who would harass and intimidate you until you gave in.\n\n\n\nThat is the reality that Washington Democrats want to impose on every working American in their&nbsp;PRO Act.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, under the&nbsp;Employee Rights Act, unions would be required to obtain members’ opt-in permission before using their membership dues for anything other than collective bargaining.&nbsp;This simple change would better protect employees and curb intimidation by union organizers.\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration has also pursued a radical regulatory agenda which seeks to strip independent contractors of their status, redefining them as traditional employees — a provision pulled straight from the&nbsp;PRO Act.&nbsp;In reality, independent contractors choose that status for a reason. Often, it has to do with the increased flexibility that such an arrangement provides.\n\n\n\nWhile the&nbsp;PRO Act&nbsp;would codify this harmful rule, the&nbsp;Employee Rights Act&nbsp;takes a commonsense approach that lets independent contractors retain their status while also allowing companies to offer benefits and incentives to independent contractors.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLet me be clear: I support Americans who want to join a union. But that’s a decision to be made bythem, not&nbsp;for&nbsp;them. Moreover, as this is a personal decision, the&nbsp;Employee Rights Act&nbsp;would protect workers’ privacy by allowing employees the right to decide whether they want their personal information shared with a union during an organizing campaign.\n\n\n\nOur workforce is constantly evolving and modernizing to meet the needs of tomorrow. It’s time our labor laws do the same, rather than doubling down on an outdated model which the vast majority of workers have long since abandoned.\n\n\n\nThe forward-looking provisions contained in the&nbsp;Employee Rights Act&nbsp;will pave the way for our economic recovery by empowering the American worker to choose a career that best suits them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRick Allen is a member of Congress representing Georgia’s 12th&nbsp;District in the United States House of Representatives.",

        "description": "Former Brexit opportunities minister becomes business and energy secretary in Liz Truss’s first cabinetJacob Rees-Mogg has taken on responsibility for energy after Liz Truss had struggled to find a dedicated minister to fill the role amid concerns over his scepticism.Two Conservative MPs are understood to have turned down the role of climate change minister earlier in the day. However, late on Tuesday night No 10 announced that Graham Stuart would take the brief and be attending cabinet, prompting speculation that Downing Street had succumbed to concerns of green Tories about giving the role to Rees-Mogg as originally planned.Clearly expectations of a final disaster are part of man’s psychology and the doomsayers of the quasi religious green movement fit the bill. Perhaps one day the world will end, giving the last group to predict it the satisfaction of being right – but as many have been wrong so far it does not seem wise to make public policy on the back of these fears.It is widely accepted that carbon dioxide emissions have risen but the effect on the climate remains much debated while the computer modelling that has been done to date has not proved especially accurate … common sense dictates that if the Meteorological Office cannot forecast the next season’s weather with any success it is ambitious to predict what will happen decades ahead.I would like my constituents to have cheap energy rather more than I would like them to have windmills.I think we have to be realistic about what we can change, the timescale over which we can change it, and actually I think mankind is highly adaptable, and we need to look at more adaptability rather than changes in behaviour.Net zero is going to be a huge regulatory cost and that is an issue for the country to face and to face up to … If we were to have a ‘one in, one out’ or ‘one in, two out’ rule [where a piece of regulation is scrapped for every new one instituted], you would end up excluding net zero, as we previously excluded EU regulation, and then you’re tinkering at the edges because you’re ignoring the biggest piece of regulation.

I therefore feel moved to respond to Mervyn Ellis and John Pelling (Letters, 4 September). Of course, electric scooters are not a viable transport solution for people living in such circumstances, though adequate public transport will help (my mother took the bus to the market in Bury as she did not drive). However, nearly half the population live in cities or large or medium towns, where it is eminently possible to eliminate car use or reduce it to the level where car club membership or the occasional use of taxis are cheaper than owning a rarely used car.As a doctor, by necessity I use a lot of single-use plastic. It is false to argue that because there will always be a need for sterile syringes, it is impossible to cut down on plastic use elsewhere. It is similarly false to argue that because some people will always need cars, no one should be encouraged to do without one.Dr Chris Howell Newcastle upon Tyne  Continue reading...",

        "description": "Former Brexit opportunities minister becomes business and energy secretary in Liz Truss’s first cabinetJacob Rees-Mogg has taken on responsibility for energy after Liz Truss had struggled to find a dedicated minister to fill the role amid concerns over his scepticism.Two Conservative MPs are understood to have turned down the role of climate change minister earlier in the day. However, late on Tuesday night No 10 announced that Graham Stuart would take the brief and be attending cabinet, prompting speculation that Downing Street had succumbed to concerns of green Tories about giving the role to Rees-Mogg as originally planned.Clearly expectations of a final disaster are part of man’s psychology and the doomsayers of the quasi religious green movement fit the bill. Perhaps one day the world will end, giving the last group to predict it the satisfaction of being right – but as many have been wrong so far it does not seem wise to make public policy on the back of these fears.It is widely accepted that carbon dioxide emissions have risen but the effect on the climate remains much debated while the computer modelling that has been done to date has not proved especially accurate … common sense dictates that if the Meteorological Office cannot forecast the next season’s weather with any success it is ambitious to predict what will happen decades ahead.I would like my constituents to have cheap energy rather more than I would like them to have windmills.I think we have to be realistic about what we can change, the timescale over which we can change it, and actually I think mankind is highly adaptable, and we need to look at more adaptability rather than changes in behaviour.Net zero is going to be a huge regulatory cost and that is an issue for the country to face and to face up to … If we were to have a ‘one in, one out’ or ‘one in, two out’ rule [where a piece of regulation is scrapped for every new one instituted], you would end up excluding net zero, as we previously excluded EU regulation, and then you’re tinkering at the edges because you’re ignoring the biggest piece of regulation.

        "description": "Photo by Maddie Malhotra/Boston Red Sox/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Kiké will be patrolling centerfield again next year, but there’s still a lot we don’t know about the 2023 outfield. Kiké Hernandez is coming back next year, and just about everyone is happy about it. He’s a great clubhouse guy, a valuable and versatile defender, and a fan-favorite. At $10 million for one season, it’s not the type of contract that can hurt the team’s flexibility, and he deserves the money more than John Henry and Tom Werner, anyway. \nSo what does this deal tell us about the 2023 Red Sox and what questions remain? Let’s take a look at what we know now.\nThere Will Be No Jarren Duran Era\nSomewhere in the Fenway Park baseball ops offices there’s a white board with a diagram of a diamond and a heading that reads 2023 Projected Depth Chart. And, until recently, it probably had a little Jarren Duran magnet in the centerfield spot.\nWas there any kind of ceremony when they took that magnet down? Did someone pull up Taps on Spotify? Did they set it on fire and send it adrift down the Muddy River like a Viking funeral? We’ll never know, but one thing’s clear: Jarren Duran will not be the starting center fielder on Opening Day in 2023, and likely won’t be a part of the 26-man roster at all. \nThis is not to say that his Red Sox career is over or that he’s definitively a bust. After all, trading him at this point would be selling extremely low, and the best path forward may be to try to rebuild some of his value before assessing any further options. But he’s not yet proven that he’s a Major League-caliber player (even as a fourth outfield option), and the Kiké extension signals that Chaim is not counting on him turning into one any time soon.\n. . . But There Might Be A Ceddanne Rafaela Era On The Horizon\nAs solid as Kiké is with the glove, he’s not the best centerfielder in the Red Sox organization. That’s because Ceddanne Rafaela is down in Portland doing things like this:\n\n\nThis angle of Ceddanne Rafaela’s catch last night is even more impressive.Fingers crossed he’s okay after leaving because of a HBP. He’s a walking web gem. pic.twitter.com/NFvVWlC3io— Tyler Milliken ⚾️ (@tylermilliken_) August 26, 2022\n\n\n\nThe 21-year-old native of Curacao is a speedy defensive guru (he also plays short) with a good hit tool and a surprising amount of power for someone who’s just 5’8”. The biggest hole in his game is plate discipline (he’s only walked 26 times this season), but his ability to make contact has resulted in a perfectly respectable .335 OBP in 60 games at the AA level this year. He’ll likely start 2023 in Worcester and, if all goes well, he’s the centerfielder of the future. \nThe Sox Still Have A Centerfield Question Mark For 2023\nKiké has cemented his status as a Red Sox cult hero for life - that’s what a 4.9 bWAR season and one legendary October performance will do. But another thing that a 4.9 bWAR season does is set some pretty high expectations, ones that he’s not likely to meet.\nIt’s almost guaranteed that he will never again be as good as he was in 2021. The question, then, is how much worse he’ll be. We can’t draw too many conclusions from this injury-riddled season, but even before he went down in early June, Kiké had regressed big time, putting up a paltry .209/.273/.340 slash line in 51 games. That’s not an everyday player on a postseason team, and if he starts slow again next year, the Sox will likely need to find another centerfield solution.\n. . . And They Still Need More Outfielders, Anyway\nBarring injuries, we know that Kiké will almost certainly be starting in center on Opening Day 2023. But who will be playing next to him in right? Frankly, there isn’t anyone currently under contract for next season who deserves the job. There is a certain 6’7”, 280-pound, likely 2022 AL MVP who could do it, but let’s get real: Chaim Bloom shows no indication of being the type of guy to give a massive contract to a 30-year-old, and the Yankees aren’t going to let that happen anyway. \nAfter Aaron Judge, the top names in the free agency market will likely be Mitch Haniger and Brandon Nimmo. Haniger struggles to stay healthy, but when he is on the field, he’s exactly the type of right-handed power bat that’s been missing from the Sox lineup this year; he could be a great replacement for JD. Nimmo can’t really stay on the field either, and he doesn’t have Haniger’s power. But he’s an on-base machine with a glove that plays in center field, so he should be able to learn how to play Fenway’s deep right field in time (if he’s not too busy hunting for missing ballot boxes from the 2020 election, that is. . . ) \nIf Bloom wants to go the reclamation project route — and let’s face it: Chaim Bloom loves a reclamation project more than the entire internet loves talking about how long ago the 90s was (a long time ago! we get it already!) — then there are plenty of options. Odubel Herrera hasn’t really shown any sign of getting back to the fringe All-Star level that he once occupied, but he will come extremely cheap. Robbie Grossman has been brutal this year, but carried a 108 OPS+ from 2016-2021. Joey Gallo may end up being the most intriguing option. But he somehow never turned into the short porch beast everyone thought he would be in Yankee Stadium, and his career numbers in Fenway are even worse: .162/.296/.351 with just 1 homer in 12 games. \nThe Kiké deal answers some questions about next year, but not all of them. We still have to wait and see where the team goes from here.",

But, still, every once in a while, we get a big belly laugh. Like last week, after President Biden remarked that the “extreme MAGA philosophy” of Donald Trump and his followers is “like semi-fascism.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn response, Republicans exploded. How dare Biden engage in such name-calling, they thundered. This, mind you, from MAGA Republicans who, following the example of their “dear leader,” excel in name-calling. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) compared the Biden administration to “Marxist dictatorships.” On Fox News, right-wing commentator Mollie Hemingway called Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine plan a “fascist move.” And at an August 2020 campaign rally, Donald Trump warned that Joe Biden would “replace American freedom with left-wing fascism. Left-wing. We’re going left-wing all the way. Fascists! They are fascists!” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn other words, it’s OK for Republicans to call Democrats “fascists,” but President Biden must apologize to the nation — Or resign? Be impeached? — for suggesting that MAGA Republicanism is semi-fascist? &nbsp;\n\n\n\nLOL.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut, of course, that begs the more important question: Is Biden right? And that depends on the meaning of fascism.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMost historians agree that, whether practiced by Italy’s Benito Mussolini or Germany’s Adolph Hitler in the 1930s, or by Hungary’s Viktor Orbán or Turkey’s Recep Erdoğan today, there are traits common to every fascist regime: cult-like loyalty to an autocratic leader; no parliamentary limits on a leader’s power; denial of free and fair elections; intolerance of, including violence against, political opposition; and outright racism and anti-Semitism. If you think MAGA Republicanism fits the bill, you’re right. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nCult-like loyalty to an autocratic leader? Check! Whether it’s attempting to bribe a foreign leader, inciting an armed mob to attack the Capitol Building, or absconding with top-secret documents, there’s nothing for which MAGA Republicans would hold Donald Trump responsible. Not even, as he suggested, shooting someone in plain sight on Fifth Avenue.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNo limits on power? Check! On Jan. 6, MAGA Republicans, at Trump’s bidding, tried to prevent Congress from doing its job. Today, they still argue that Trump’s above the law when it comes to cooperating with the Justice Department.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDenial of free and fair elections? Check! As recently as his rally in Pennsylvania last Saturday, Trump still refuses to accept Biden as president. He’s hardly alone. According to FiveThirtyEight, at least 120 election deniers, whose primary purpose is to negate the 2020 election, won Republican primaries and are on the ballot in November.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nViolence against political opposition? Check! Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Trump’s guest at his Pennsylvania rally, has repeatedly endorsed calls for political violence, including in 2019, when she “liked” a Facebook post suggesting a “bullet to the head” of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). On Jan. 6, Trump supporters chanted “Hang Mike Pence.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) warned of “riots in the streets” if the Justice Department files charges against Trump in connection with stolen classified documents. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRacism and anti-Semitism? Check! Trump welcomed the support of white supremacists, issued a ban on Muslims entering the country, attacked the Black Lives Matter movement, and insisted there were “very fine people” among those who marched through Charlottesville chanting “The Jews shall not replace us.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhich brings us back to the central question: Was President Biden right in calling the politics of Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans “semi-fascist?” No, Biden was wrong. He didn’t go far enough. Based on what they’ve said, what they’ve done, and their ongoing efforts to undermine democracy, Biden shouldn’t have called MAGA Republicans semi-fascists. He should have called them outright fascists, period.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPress is host of “The Bill Press Pod.” He is the author of “From the Left: A Life in the Crossfire.”&nbsp;",

        "description": "Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) on Tuesday backed a plan by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to fast-track the approval process for U.S. energy projects. \n\n\n\n“While energy prices fall in Ohio and across the country, [Russian President] Vladimir Putin continues to leverage Russia’s oil and gas reserves to hold Ukraine and the rest of the world hostage,” Ryan said in a statement, urging a House vote on the proposed legislation.\n\n\n\n“Our current approval processes for infrastructure, including energy infrastructure, simply take too long—posing a significant threat to our economic development, national security, and ability to maintain our competitive edge against countries like China,” Ryan said.\n\n\n\nManchin's proposed plan would expedite the permitting process, setting up, among other provisions, a two year maximum timeline for the process of environmental reviews of energy projects. \n\n\n\nDemocratic leadership promised Manchin the permitting reforms in exchange for his support of their climate, health care and tax reconciliation bill, the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act. But some in the party have now questioned whether the changes will undermine the environmental reviews.\n\n\n\nProgressives are pushing back against including the permitting agreement in a government funding measure as Congress works to secure funding and avoid a shutdown.\n\n\n\nA release from Ryan’s office contends that Manchin’s plan does not bypass existing review processes and will allow energy projects to “proceed faster without sacrificing responsible oversight and stakeholder input.”\n\n\n\nRyan is running for Senate in Ohio, vying to replace Sen. Rob Portman (R), who opted not to run for reelection.",

        "description": "Kim Kardashian says the United States is regressing following the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n\n“I’m studying civil procedure and criminal procedure right now, so just understanding the process of how Roe v. Wade got overturned — it’s fascinating and scary,” the reality TV star, who’s studying to be a lawyer, told Interview magazine in a story published Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June, eliminating the nearly 50-year precedent that established a constitutional right to abortion.\n\n\n\nIn an opinion concurring with the majority decision, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested revisiting a number of other rights that the court had previously affirmed, including access to contraceptives and LGBTQ rights.\n\n\n\n“Just seeing how far our country has progressed, to then see it regress — it’s really scary to think that gay marriage is in jeopardy,” Kardashian, 41, said.\n\n\n\n“If a court can decide what a woman does with her body, then it also puts having children through surrogacy, and things that I have been through, in jeopardy,” the mother of four told the mag.\n\n\n\n“I always believed people should live their lives exactly how they want to,” the tabloid fixture and criminal justice reform advocate added, “so it’s really scary to see all of this happening.”\n\n\n\nAsked for suggestions on how Americans can “fight back,” Kardashian replied, “Never stop speaking your truth, and never stop fighting for what you believe in.”\n\n\n\n“I think it’s so important to use your voice and speak out,” she said, “and I do think that it’s effective.”\n\n\n\nKardashian — whose famous family has been criticized for their frequent use of private planes — also weighed in on the environment and the public’s impact in combating climate change.\n\n\n\n“I believe in climate change, and I believe that anything can help,” Kardashian said.\n\n\n\n“But I also believe in being realistic and I think sometimes there’s so much to worry about on this planet, and it can be really scary to live your life with anxiety.”\n\n\n\n“I have super climate change–involved friends, and I love learning from them,” she said. “I do what I can, but you have to pick and choose what really works for you in your life.”",

        "description": "A glacier that could cause a multi-foot sea level increase if it melted is disappearing at about twice the previously observed rate, according to a&nbsp;study&nbsp;published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlthough the findings indicate the rate of retreat has slowed in recent years, researchers also saw indications that past a certain point the recession could begin increasing rapidly again. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Thwaites is really holding on today by its fingernails, and we should expect to see big changes over small timescales in the future — even from one year to the next — once the glacier retreats beyond a shallow ridge in its bed,” co-author Robert Larter of the British Antarctic Survey said in a statement.  \n\n\n\n“Just a small kick to Thwaites could lead to a big response,” added Graham.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResearchers, led by Alistair Graham of the University of South Florida, analyzed historical data on the retreat of the Thwaites Glacier, which is about the size of Florida and considered among the most vulnerable parts of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. They found that during a five-month period in the previous two centuries, the glacier receded at an annual rate of about 1.3 miles — twice the rate observed over the 2010s.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile analysis of the glacier has historically been limited to the three decades of available satellite imagery, Graham and his team were able to trace its path back further based on the glacier’s imprint on the seabed. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier is also known as the “Doomsday Glacier” for the sea level rise its melt could cause — just over two feet. It is at particular risk due to its position on the ocean floor rather than land, making it vulnerable to warming ocean currents. \n\n\n\nThe study comes less than a month after separate research indicating the worst impacts of climate change on the East Antarctic Ice Sheet could be held back if global temperature increases are kept below 2 degrees Celsius. ",

        "title": "University endowments should be the primary source of student loans",
        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/education/3630542-university-endowments-should-be-the-primary-source-of-student-loans/",
        "description": "Here’s a modest proposal: Colleges and universities should draw from their own endowments to provide student loans before that obligation is foisted off on taxpayers.\n\n\n\nWhen President Obama federalized student loans in 2010, he promised the move would save the taxpayers $68 billion. That didn’t happen.\n\n\n\nIf President Joe Biden’s unilateral decision to cancel student debt passes constitutional challenges, which is doubtful, taxpayers could be on the hook for more than $500 billion.\n\n\n\nBut while the federal government hands out billions of dollars in student loans, many colleges and universities are sitting on endowments also worth billions.\n\n\n\nCollege and university endowment officers invest their funds in a range of ways. So how about “investing” that money in students, in essence, becoming the student-loaner of first resort rather than the government?\n\n\n\nFirst some facts. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, a federal agency, “At the end of fiscal year 2020, the market value of the endowment funds of colleges and universities was $691 billion.”\n\n\n\nHarvard’s endowment leads the pack, with nearly $42 billion. Yale comes in second with $31.2 billion. And while both of those are private universities, the University of Texas system, a public university system, comes in third at $30.5 billion.\n\n\n\nAnd it’s not just a few colleges and universities. At the end of 2018, about 75 percent of public and private universities had more than $10 million in their endowments.\n\n\n\nHow do the universities invest that money? The American Council on Education (ACE) says that in 2020:\n\n\n\n71.8 percent was invested in traditional stocks, bonds and cash;\n\n\n\n21 percent was invested in private equity, such as hedge funds; and\n\n\n\n7.2 percent was invested in natural resources and other “real” assets.\n\n\n\nBut don’t university endowments use some of those funds for student aid? Yes, but that money generally comes from the endowment’s earnings, not the principle.\n\n\n\nSuppose Congress were to require colleges and universities with significant endowments to use some portion of those endowment funds – say, up to 75 percent – to provide student loans. Once the endowment had reached whatever cap was set, the federal student loan program would step in as a backup.\n\n\n\nColleges and universities invest their endowment funds to make a profit. Under this plan, student loan repayments would provide much of that profit.\n\n\n\nSeveral benefits could accrue from this policy. First, the ones who benefit most from student loans – the universities that receive the money and the students getting the education – would bear the cost and risk, not taxpayers. Of course, the federal student loan program would still be available if a university hit its endowment cap or if the institution has little or no endowment money.\n\n\n\nSecond, colleges and universities would have a financial interest in ensuring their students get good educations, and degrees, in areas that are likely to allow them to get a good job and pay back the money. That change might also lead to a number of constructive changes in the less-useful courses and degree plans currently offered.\n\n\n\nThird, the change might encourage colleges and universities to better control their tuition costs.\n\n\n\nComplaints about rampant college tuition increases, much higher than the rate of inflation, are ubiquitous. But under the current federal student loan program, millions of students are largely insulated from the actual costs they’re incurring. It almost seems like free money, and maybe it will be if Biden’s student debt cancellation survives.\n\n\n\nThat cost insulation is a major factor in students’ willingness to borrow and spend thousands of dollars on a college degree. If colleges and universities had to turn to their endowments as the first line of student loans, they might decide to get their costs under control.\n\n\n\nUniversity endowments aim to make 7.0 percent to 7.5 percent on their endowment funds. Could they make that much loaning to students? Probably not, but it may not be that far off.\n\n\n\nHere’s what Nerd Wallet says: “The interest rates for all new federal direct undergraduate student loans are 4.99%, up from 3.73% in 2021-22. Unsubsidized direct graduate student loan rates are 6.54%, up from 5.28%. Rates for PLUS loans, which are for graduate students and parents, are 7.54%, up from 6.28%.”\n\n\n\nThe best way to provide student loans is through private sector financial institutions. But Obama probably closed that door for good. The next best way is to let those who benefit bear the cost and risk. That’s what would happen if endowments became the student-loaner of first resort.\n\n\n\nMerrill Matthews is a resident scholar with the Institute for Policy Innovation in Dallas, Texas.

        "description": "A global nuclear watchdog said Tuesday that there is an “urgent” need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident related to shelling near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant. \n\n\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a new report released on Tuesday, specifically called for an end to gunfire near the power plant and the establishment of a protection zone around it. \n\n\n\n“Pending the end of the conflict and re-establishment of stable conditions there is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means,” the IAEA report said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This can be achieved by the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone,” the agency continued. \n\n\n\nThe IAEA noted in the report that some damage had already been caused to parts of the plant, and that ongoing shelling could have worse consequences, including the “unlimited release of radioactive materials to the environment.”\n\n\n\nExposure to very high levels of radiation can cause skin burns, nausea, vomiting and sometimes death in the short term. In the long term, it can cause cancer and cardiovascular disease. \n\n\n\nRussia seized the Zaporizhia plant in March, around the start of its invasion of Ukraine. Recently, the IAEA warned of “renewed shelling” in the area, leading to concerns about a potential accident. ",

        "description": "The nation’s second largest public school district announced on Tuesday that it was targeted in a recent cyberattack.\n\n\n\nLos Angeles Unified School District announced that officials detected unusual activity over the weekend, which it said was “likely criminal” ransomware, after announcing the previous day that the district’s email system and some other technological services were disrupted.\n\n\n\nSchool officials said in a statement that schools would open as scheduled on Tuesday, and the White House had brought together the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Education Department to assist.\n\n\n\n“Los Angeles Unified is immediately establishing a plan of action, informed by top public and private sector technology and cyber security professionals, to determine additional protections for the District, and to provide an independent opinion on system-wide protective measures,” the district wrote in its statement.\n\n\n\n“We will continue to benefit from the declared assistance of federal and state law enforcement entities to assist with investigative procedures and technical deployment and solutions,” it continued.\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the White House and the three federal agencies involved for further details on the attack.\n\n\n\nThe district announced later on Tuesday it was requiring all students and employees to change their email passwords.\n\n\n\nSchool officials said that although they expect classroom instruction, transportation and food services to move forward without “major technical issues,” some of the district’s business operations may be delayed or modified.\n\n\n\n“Based on a preliminary analysis of critical business systems, employee healthcare and payroll are not impacted, nor has the cyber incident impacted safety and emergency mechanisms in place at schools,” the district said in the statement.\n\n\n\nLos Angeles Unified School District also announced nine steps it would take in response to the incident, including a full-scale reorganization of its technology investments, mandatory cybersecurity employee training and a forensic review of the district’s systems.The attack comes as multiple critical sectors have seen a rise in cyberattacks this year, forcing many companies to improve their cyber defenses.",

        "description": "Firefighters coordinate efforts at a burning property while battling the Fairview Fire on Monday, near Hemet, Calif.Ethan Swope/APCalifornia is facing its highest chance of blackouts this year as a brutal heat wave continues to blanket the state with triple-digit temperatures. State energy officials said the electrical load Tuesday afternoon could top 51,000 megawatts, the highest demand the state has ever seen. As people crank up their air conditioners, the state forecasted record levels of energy use, said Elliot Mainzer, president of California Independent System Operators, which runs the state&#x27;s electrical grid. The state has additional energy capacity at the moment &quot;but blackouts, rolling, rotating outages are a possibility,&quot; Mainzer said, calling additional conservation &quot;absolutely essential.&quot;The CAISO site Tuesday morning showed California could fall more than 5,000 megawatts short of its power supply at peak demand, forecasted for 5:30 p.m.The danger of wildfires was extreme as scorching heat and low humidity turned brush to tinder. Four deaths were reported over the Labor Day weekend as some 4,400 firefighters battled 14 large fires around the state, with 45 new blazes on Sunday alone, said Anale Burlew, a deputy chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. In Southern California, two people were killed and one injured by the Fairview Fire, which started Monday near the city of Hemet, the Riverside County Fire Department said. Roughly 50 miles southeast of Los Angeles, the fire had quickly spread to more than 2,000 acres by 11 p.m., prompting evacuations, and was only 5% contained. Multiple residential structures burned. California&#x27;s energy grid runs on a mix of mostly solar and natural gas during the day, along with some imports of power from other states. But solar power begins to fall off during the late afternoon and into the evening, which is the hottest time of day in some parts of the state. And some of the aging natural gas plants California relies on for backup power aren&#x27;t as reliable in hot weather. At CAISO&#x27;s request on Monday, four temporary emergency power generators deployed by the Department of Water Resources in Roseville and Yuba City were activated for the first time since they were installed last year, providing up to 120 megawatts, enough electricity for 120,000 homes.CAISO also has issued a Flex Alert call for voluntary conservation between 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesday, making seven alerts in as many days. Consumers were urged to keep air conditioners at 78 degrees (25.5 degrees C) or higher during the period and avoiding using major appliances such as ovens and dishwashers. The efforts have worked to keep the lights on &quot;but we have now entered the most intense phase of this heat wave&quot; that could last into the week, and two to three times the level of conservation will be needed from people and businesses, Mainzer said.Rick Fitzpatrick holds a dog after evacuating from the Fairview Fire on Monday near Hemet, Calif.Ethan Swope/APCAISO also issued a Stage 2 Energy Emergency Alert from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. Monday. The second of three emergency alert stages means taking emergency energy-saving measures &quot;such as tapping backup generators, buying more power from other states and using so-called demand response programs,&quot; according to a CAISO website. Stage 3 would be rolling blackouts.Several hundred thousand Californians lost power in rolling blackouts in August 2020 amid hot weather, but the state avoided a similar scenario last summer. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation on Friday that could allow the state&#x27;s last remaining nuclear plant to stay open beyond its planned 2025 closure, to ensure more power. The National Weather Service predicted highs between 100 and 115 degrees (37.7 C and 46.1 C) across inland California, with 80s to 90s (above 26.6 C and below 37.2 C) closer to the coast. Nighttime won&#x27;t bring much relief, with many places seeing lows in the 80s or even 90s (above 26.6 C and below 37.2 C). Ironically, unsettled weather also brought the chance of thunderstorms over Southern California and into the Sierra Nevada, with a few isolated areas of rain but nothing widespread. The storms also could produce lightning, forecasters said, which can spark wildfires.South of the Oregon state line, the Mill Fire was 55 percent contained Tuesday morning after killing two people, injuring others and destroying at least 88 homes and other buildings since it erupted last week, CalFire said. The bodies of the two women, 66 and 73, were found in the city of Weed on Friday, the Siskyou County Sheriff&#x27;s Office announced Monday. Details weren&#x27;t immediately released. A few miles away, the Mountain Fire grew to nearly 18 square miles (29 square kilometers) square miles and only 20 percent contained, with winds threatening to renew its eastward spread in steep terrain, fire officials said. Scientists say climate change has made western states warmer and drier over the last three decades and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.

I am simply admiring the beauty of it, while it is fresh and new.\n\nBecause it won’t be fresh and new for long. This thing I’m feeling is not much different from how I felt using email for the first time - “Grandma got my message already? In Florida? In seconds?” It was the nearest thing to magic my child-self had ever seen. Now email is the most boring and mundane part of my day.\n\nThere is already much talk about practical uses. Malicious uses. Downplaying. Up playing. Biases. Monetization. Democratization - which is really just monetization with a more marketable name.\n\nI’m not trying to get into any of that here. I’m just thinking about those 4.2 gigabytes. How small it seems, in today’s terms. Such a little bundle that holds so much.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

The court of appeal ruling annuls the verdict on the basis that the trial judge’s interventions during the initial hearing amounted to a miscarriage of justice. This included that the judge effectively prevented defence counsel from questioning the alleged victim whether she had allowed Clancy to have sex with her.Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Continue reading...",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/3630896-white-house-boosters-likely-only-needed-annually/",
        "description": "Top White House health officials indicated Tuesday that the public is likely to need annual COVID-19 booster shots, making this year's updated booster similar to an annual flu shot. \n\n\n\n\"It is becoming increasingly clear that, looking forward with the COVID-19 pandemic, in the absence of a dramatically different variant, we likely are moving towards a path of vaccination cadence similar to that of the annual influenza vaccine, with annual updated COVID-19 shots matched to the currently circulating strains for most of the population,” Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious diseases doctor, said during a briefing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe messaging from the White House is an attempt to sell the public on the benefits of the variant-specific booster dose that was authorized last week.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the White House signals a shift from the emergency phase of the pandemic, officials are trying to ensure people stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots.\n\n\n\nThe \"bivalent\" booster shots from both Pfizer and Moderna are expected to be widely available this week, and officials said 90 percent of Americans will live within five miles of vaccination sites.\n\n\n\nThe administration will ensure the boosters remain available at no cost to the public, White House coronavirus response coordinator Ashish Jha told reporters.\n\n\n\n\"The pandemic isn't over, and we will remain vigilant. And, of course, we will continue to look for and prepare for unforeseen twists and turns,\" Jha said, adding that \"variant curveballs\" could undermine plans, and the highest risk individuals will likely need more than just an annual booster.\n\n\n\n\"But this week marks an important shift in a fight against the virus. It marks our ability to make COVID vaccines a more routine part of our lives as we continue to drive down serious illness and deaths and protect Americans heading into the fall in winter,\" Jha said.\n\n\n\nAdministration officials say the new vaccines will be key to controlling a potential fall surge, but they will need to convince an increasingly checked-out public to get the shots. Demand for vaccines has waned with each subsequent booster campaign.\n\n\n\nThe White House is simultaneously projecting that COVID-19 is now a disease that is a part of everyday life while also urging people to be vaccinated. \n\n\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said hospitalizations are decreasing overall but increasing among older patients relative to younger ones. The virus is still killing an average of 375 people per day, a number that is \"far too high for a vaccine-preventable disease,\" Walensky said.\n\n\n\nThe new shots could help prevent as many as 100,000 hospitalizations and 9,000 deaths per year, she said.",

        "description": "The U.S. military will hold a test launch of an&nbsp;intercontinental ballistic missile&nbsp;(ICBM) on Tuesday, less than a month after the last such test, the Pentagon’s top spokesperson said Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAir Force Global Strike Command will hold an “operational test launch” of an unarmed Minuteman III ICBM in the early morning of Sept. 7 from Vandenberg Space Force Base, Calif., Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters. \n\n\n\n“This launch is a routine test which was scheduled far in advance and consistent with previous tests. This ICBM launch will validate and verify effectiveness and readiness of the system,” Ryder said.  \n\n\n\nHe added that the United States has given the Russian government an advanced notice of the launch, in accordance with standard procedures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Minuteman III, which is capable of holding a nuclear payload, was last tested on Aug. 16 after being delayed for nearly two weeks due to&nbsp;increased tensions with China&nbsp;over Taiwan.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRyder said that the launch is being held less than a month after the last such&nbsp;test due to the delay of the previous launch moving the dates closer together. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the past year, test launches of the&nbsp;Minuteman III have been pushed back several times thanks to U.S. tensions with Russia over Moscow's attack on Ukraine, as well as stresses between Washington and Beijing in relation to Taiwan.\n\n\n\nMinuteman III ICBMs are located in underground silos in five Western states and are tested several times a year. The missiles have a range of more than 6,000 miles and can travel up to 15,000 miles per hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

We're going to focus on what's happening today,\" she replied.\n\n\n\nJean-Pierre also criticized the Fox News reporter for his question. \n\n\n\n\"Let's be really clear that that comparison that you made is just ridiculous,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"I was talking specifically at that time of what was happening with voting rights and what was danger of voting rights.\" \n\n\n\nAs Doocy was setting up his question,&nbsp;Jean-Pierre interjected \"Oh, I knew this was coming.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"I was waiting, Peter, when you were going to ask me that question,\" she joked.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLast week, Biden slammed Republicans loyal to Trump as a threat to democracy, saying there was \"no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.\"\n\n\n\nMany conservative critics, including on Fox News, have criticized Biden's remarks as intentionally divisive and partisan ahead of the fall midterm elections.  \n\n\n\nUpdated at 1:40 p.m.",

It’s too dire. Politics are killing people.”\n\n\n\nThe 32-year-old actor, who expressed support for President Biden in 2020, said she’s still coming to terms with former President Trump’s 2016 election victory over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\n“It breaks my heart because America had the choice between a woman and a dangerous, dangerous jar of mayonnaise. And they were like,&nbsp;‘Well, we can’t have a woman. Let’s go with the jar of mayonnaise.’\"\n\n\n\nTrump’s White House win, Lawrence said, helped to form a political rift in her family back in Kentucky. Lawrence has said in the past that she grew up in a Republican household.\n\n\n\n“I just worked so hard in the last five years to forgive my dad and my family and try to understand:&nbsp;It’s different. The information they are getting is different. Their life is different.”\n\n\n\nThe \"American Hustle\" actor also railed against the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in June, revealing she intended to get an abortion when she got pregnant in her early 20s.\n\n\n\nBefore Lawrence terminated the pregnancy, she said, “I had a miscarriage alone in Montreal.”\n\n\n\nLawrence said she suffered another miscarriage while shooting the film “Don’t Look Up” a few years ago, before giving birth to her first child with husband Cooke Maroney in February.\n\n\n\n“I remember a million times thinking about it while I was pregnant. Thinking about the things that were happening to my body. And I had a great pregnancy. I had a very fortunate pregnancy. But every single second of my life was different. And it would occur to me sometimes: What if I was&nbsp;forced&nbsp;to do this?” Lawrence said.\n\n\n\nThe entertainer suggested that the Roe decision intensified the political divide between her relatives.\n\n\n\n“I don’t want to disparage my family, but I know that a lot of people are in a similar position with their families. How could you raise a daughter from birth and believe that she doesn’t deserve equality?&nbsp;How?” she asked.\n\n\n\n“Get the government out of my snatch. Okay?” Lawrence told Vogue.\n\n\n\nLawrence also blasted aging lawmakers, including 80-year-old Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\n\n\n“We have to live in the future that they’re creating. These people are&nbsp;f---ing old,” Lawrence said.\n\n\n\n“They’re&nbsp;a hundred,” she added. “McConnell was alive and well and thriving when&nbsp;schools were segregated.”\n\n\n\nShe also knocked Ohio Senate hopeful J.D. Vance (R), who’s in a heated race in the Buckeye State against Rep. Tim Ryan (D).\n\n\n\n“He’s not a hillbilly if he wrote a huge book,” Lawrence said of Vance, author of “Hillbilly Elegy.”\n\n\n\n“Rich twat,” Lawrence said of Vance. “I mean,&nbsp;I’m&nbsp;a rich twat, but I’m not running for office pretending that I’m not.”\n\n\n\nAsked if she still talks politics with her family, Lawrence said, “I broach the subject in the sense that I unleash text messages. Just:&nbsp;Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.&nbsp;They don’t respond.”\n\n\n\n“And then I’ll feel bad and send a picture of the baby,” she said.",

        "description": "Nearly nine million people passed through the nation’s airports during the Labor Day weekend, the first holiday weekend to surpass pre-pandemic air travel levels, according to Transportation Security Administration (TSA) data.\n\n\n\nThe agency announced on Tuesday it screened 8.76 million passengers between Friday and Monday, which was 102 percent of the Labor Day weekend passenger volume in 2019.\n\n\n\n“TSA’s highly trained and dedicated workforce facilitated secure travel for millions of passengers during the busy summer travel season with very little disruptions at the checkpoint,” TSA Acting Administrator David Pekoske said in a statement. “We were also able to continue the deployment of new technologies that facilitate stronger identity verification procedures and enhanced security screening for carry-on bags.”\n\n\n\nThe agency screened nearly 2.48 million passengers on Friday alone, the second highest single-day total since the start of the pandemic. TSA screened about 2.49 million passengers on the Friday preceding Independence Day.\n\n\n\nFlying demand surged this summer, with nine of the ten highest passenger outputs during the pandemic occurring since June of this year. \n\n\n\nDespite the recent increase, however, passenger output during summer holiday weekends like Memorial Day and Independence Day remained below pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\n\nMany passengers experienced flight delays and cancellations during those holiday weekends as the industry struggled to support the increased demand, making for a messy summer travel season.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConsumer complaints against airlines have also soared this year, leading Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to propose stricter airline refund regulations and publish a new dashboard on airlines’ commitments during delays and cancellations.\n\n\n\nAirlines say issues like staffing shortages and severe weather fueled the large number of disruptions, although they have also placed some of the blame on staffing shortages at air traffic control centers, particularly in the busy New York and Florida travel corridors.\n\n\n\nMany airlines, like Delta Air Lines and JetBlue, cut back their schedules for parts of the summer to improve reliability.\n\n\n\nFlight reliability fared better over the Labor Day weekend compared to some recent holiday travel. Airlines canceled 179 flights and delayed 5,299 flights on Friday, compared to 587 cancellations and 7,853 delays on the Friday preceding Independence Day, according to Flight Aware.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the young individuals who moved back in with their parents during COVID-19, two-thirds still live there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStagnant wages, inflation and high rent prices might all dissuade these individuals from moving out of their parents’ homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving to purchase a home and paying off debt were two of the most common financial reasons cited by children for the living arrangement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic threw long term education and housing plans into flux for many Americans and the Millennials and Gen Zers who moved back in with their parents during the crisis are still feeling the ramifications.\n\n\n\nA new survey from LendingTree shows the majority of individuals who moved back in with their parents during the pandemic still live there, more than two years after COVID-19 first struck the U.S.\n\n\n\nFindings are based on survey responses from more than 1,300 U.S. parents, Millennials and Gen Zers recorded between July 26-29, 2022. Millennials were defined as those aged 26 through 41, while Gen Zers were those aged 18 through 25.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResults show 32 percent of these young Americans moved back in with their parents during the pandemic, two-thirds of whom continue to live there. Just over half of these individuals said the move was out of necessity, as many focus on paying off their debt and saving to purchase a home.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwenty-three percent of those surveyed said they moved back in with their parents to save up for retirement.\n\n\n\nIndividuals aged 24 to 40 are most likely to live with their parents in Hawai’i, New Jersey and Florida. High costs of living in both New Jersey and Hawai’i likely contributed to this finding, researchers said, while “adult children living at home in Florida, a state where the cost of living is lower, may be at home to care for an older parent.”\n\n\n\nResearchers said that “as of 2019, Florida had the second-highest population of residents 65 or older, with more than 1 in 5 (20.9 percent) in that age demographic statewide.”\n\n\n\nIn comparison, the co-living arrangement was least likely in North Dakota, Nebraska and South Dakota, which could be due in part to low unemployment rates in these states.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn the parents’ end, over 80 percent said they would let children move back in as adults or have already done so, and 73 percent said they would not charge their children rent if they came back. But the majority of parents said they would expect help with household chores and for children to be employed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe findings come alongside reports documenting challenges young people face when it comes to buying a home, while rising inflation, stagnant wages and higher rents throughout the country all compound the financial hardships plaguing young Americans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“With inflation as high as it is and with rates rising, it can be difficult for anyone to make ends meet in today’s economy,” said Jacob Channel, LendingTree senior economist, in a statement. Younger individuals working in entry-level jobs may also not have enough cash flow to sustain moving out of their parents’ home, Channel added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUpon moving out of their parents’ homes, 73 percent of respondents said they were more likely to rent than purchase a home.&nbsp;",

        "title": "There should be no war over Taiwan",
        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3622891-there-should-be-no-war-over-taiwan/",
        "description": "After a week of consultations and briefings in Taiwan with a team from Brookings Institution — our visit was sandwiched between those by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) in time, and by Chinese missiles, airplanes and warships in space — I came back to the United States convinced more than ever that there really should be no war over Taiwan — not soon, not in a few years, not ever.\n\n\n\nOf course, war is always bad and should be avoided when possible. But I am trying to say more than that. Specifically, none of the three governments that could begin a war over Taiwan — those in Washington, Beijing and Taipei — should see war as in its interest. To do so would be to make an even worse mistake than Russian President Vladimir Putin’s when he chose to attack Ukraine in February in the apparent belief that he could achieve a quick and relatively easy win.&nbsp; This is true today and will remain so for the foreseeable future — though the United States and Taiwan should take steps to improve the odds that Chinese President Xi Jinping will see war as highly undesirable, if he does not see it that way already.\n\n\n\nAs I attempted to show in a paper released by Brookings during our Taiwan trip, it is unrealistic, if not impossible, to predict which side would win any conflict over Taiwan. That would be true even if the war were to remain limited in geography and scale. For example, China could lose most of its submarine fleet, in some scenarios, and see any blockade defeated, according to certain plausible assumptions about how well our anti-submarine warfare platforms might function as they searched for those submarines. But there is no guarantee of that outcome, either. If the submarines were particularly hard for us to find — especially likely if China can successfully attack air bases on Okinawa and ships we might use to create convoys east of Taiwan, a possibility that cannot be dismissed — we could lose much of our surface Navy and fail to end the strangulation of Taiwan by China’s submarine force. Either of these outcomes is plausible, and in my view, impossible to dismiss in advance. \n\n\n\nMost likely, the war would not remain limited. Neither Beijing nor Washington would accept defeat in a limited engagement. Instead, the conflict probably would expand horizontally to other regions and vertically, perhaps even to include nuclear weapons threats — or their actual use. It literally could become the worst catastrophe in the history of warfare.\n\n\n\nEven if a war were somehow to be “winnable” — perhaps because Taiwan’s political leadership were arrested or killed and a successor regime chose to surrender rather than fight, or because the United States somehow chose to sit the war out and China rapidly prevailed — the economic consequences would be enormous. For all the talk of “decoupling” China’s economic relationship with the West, that is not really happening. Rather, some investments in areas such as high technology that might have been envisioned for China some years ago are instead being directed elsewhere, to safer harbors. But most existing trade patterns are being sustained, even in the face of America’s tariffs dating to the Trump administration. \n\n\n\nBy contrast, if China attacks Taiwan, everything will likely change. America surely would find it unacceptable to maintain most existing economic relationships with China. Current investments and trade patterns would be wound down over the months and years to come — to the extreme detriment of both sides (especially China, and especially if most of our allies made the same policy changes, since there is nowhere else besides the Western world where China can find 1 billion wealthy consumers looking to purchase its goods).\n\n\n\nMore specifically, this is why it would be a huge mistake for each party to blunder into war:\n\n\n\nFor Taiwan, any belief that the United States could rescue it from the jaws of an angered China would fail to appreciate the above military realities. China has the second-best military in the world and geography gives it a home-field advantage in any war over and near Taiwan. None of the weapons systems or other innovations that the Pentagon is considering today will change the basic reality that, in an era of precision-strike modern weaponry, Taiwan will be extremely hard for us to defend — even with allies and even in the best of circumstances. If Taiwan’s leaders do not understand this, they need more military briefings. Fortunately, I believe President Tsia Ing-wen does get it and will avoid the kinds of escalatory steps (such as declaring independence) that could make war likely.\n\n\n\nFor the United States, any belief that U.S.-China war is virtually inevitable due to the “Thucydides’ Trap” (what often happens historically when a rising power meets an established superpower) is deterministic, fatalistic and foolish. Yet there are quarters of the American strategic community that hold this view. We must appreciate that, while America should not abandon its democratic friend in Taiwan, the issue of Taiwan’s future is a particularly sensitive one for not just China’s Communist Party but most of its people — akin to how we might feel if Alaska or Hawaii were to seek independence. Nor should we become so enthralled with any new defense strategy, whether of Jim Mattis or Lloyd Austin or anyone else, that we believe it somehow can restore the kind of reliable war-winning capabilities we once wielded against China in the western Pacific. The world will always be more complicated going forward.\n\n\n\nFor the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi, deciding that Taiwan must be brought into the “motherland” by some specific date or during the tenure of the current president would be a mistake of colossal proportions given all of China’s other ambitions and needs. There is a good chance that World War III would result. This goal is simply not worth it, especially when there is considerable hope that someday — even if probably well after Xi’s rule — Taiwan and China could agree to form some kind of loose confederation.\n\n\n\nIn short, however unsatisfying, the status quo — China claiming and wanting reunification with Taiwan but not achieving it anytime soon, Taiwan wanting autonomy and self-governance but forgoing independence, and America wanting peace in the region and self-determination for Taiwan but needing to maintain vigilance indefinitely to achieve those outcomes — is much better than rolling the dice on war to try to settle the issue.\n\n\n\nStill, there is work to do. For the United States and Taiwan, two steps in particular are crucial.  First, we need to improve our respective military modernization programs to further complicate China’s chances of a successful attack on Taiwan. That means, among other things, more tools for Taiwan to carry out a “porcupine defense” of the island (with lots of mobile anti-ship missiles, rapidly-deployable shallow-water minefields, Stingers and Javelins and other such short-range missiles, and hardened communications networks); more survivable weaponry for the United States in the western Pacific that does not require big fixed airfields or aircraft carriers to launch sensors and weapons; and better preparation for the consequences of what could be a long economic war against China (by reducing our dependencies on China to some reasonable extent).\n\n\n\nBut second, we also need to stop demonizing China, even as we do push back against its repressions of internal minorities or dissidents and its assertive behavior abroad. Among other things, that means avoiding accusations that China is committing “genocide” against the Uyghurs (a loaded term if ever there was one) and recognizing the great accomplishments it has made in recent decades in lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty, in China and beyond.\n\n\n\nThere will not be an easy answer to the challenge of China’s rise, and its consequences will be with us for all of our lifetimes. The goal must be, first and foremost, avoiding war so that those lifetimes can run their natural course rather than being risked in hegemonic conflict.\n\n\n\nMichael O’Hanlon is the Philip H.

The decision will also likely slow down any investigation into Trump’s handling of classified materials after leaving office, which could allow Trump to further cast the search as a partisan exercise ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n\n\n“Trump will treat this order as a win, even though it is unconvincing and lacks support in pertinent precedents and is unnecessarily solicitous of Trump,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond.\n\n\n\n“Trump will also see this as a win, because the judge appeared to stop the DOJ from continuing the investigation, which will slow it for some time,” Tobias added. “The DOJ will have to decide whether to appeal the ruling.”\n\n\n\nMyriad factors could further draw out the process. Cannon asked the parties to submit names to potentially serve as the special master by Friday. But the Department of Justice (DOJ) could appeal Cannon’s ruling, something it would likely have to do before agreeing to submit names.\n\n\n\nAn appeal could extend the process, but if a special master is appointed, experts said, it would be difficult to pinpoint exactly how long it might take for the individual to go through all of the documents.\n\n\n\nTrump’s legal team had for weeks advocated for the appointment of a special master, or a neutral third party who would sift through the seized materials to identify anything unrelated to the investigation or covered by privilege.\n\n\n\nIn Cannon’s ruling, she wrote that the eventual appointee would determine what is covered by both attorney-client privilege as well as executive privilege. The latter was viewed as an unusual step given Trump is no longer in the White House and the Justice Department is part of the executive branch of government.\n\n\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the ruling, Trump and his associates viewed it as a victory while further fanning distrust in the FBI and DOJ investigation of the former president.\n\n\n\nMike Davis, president of the Article III Project, a conservative judiciary group, touted the ruling as a “major legal victory for President Trump; major legal blow for Biden Justice Department.”\n\n\n\n“The FBI does not get to oversee itself. GOOD,” Jenna Ellis, who led Trump’s numerous failed legal challenges to the 2020 election, tweeted about Cannon’s ruling.\n\n\n\n“The DOJ FAILED in stopping an independent special master from reviewing the documents from illegal raid on President Trump’s home. Why was the DOJ trying so hard to stop this? Are they trying to hide something?” tweeted Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas), Trump’s former White House physician.\n\n\n\nOne former Trump adviser argued the ruling was a positive one for the former president if for no other reason than because it would slow down the investigation and potentially keep it out of the news cycle while the special master is appointed and then works through the numerous documents.\n\n\n\nTrump, for his part, responded to the news by suggesting the judge’s decision invalidated the 2020 election and attacking the FBI and DOJ.\n\n\n\n“Remember, it takes courage and ‘guts’ to fight a totally corrupt Department of ‘Justice’ and the FBI,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. “They are being pushed to do the wrong things by many sinister and evil outside sources. Until impartiality, wisdom, fairness, and courage are shown by them, our Country can never come back or recover—it will be reduced to being a Third World Nation!”\n\n\n\nThe constant attacks are reminiscent of how Trump has handled previous investigations into his conduct, such as the Russia probe and the two impeachment proceedings against him. In each of those cases, he repeatedly decried them as politically motivated “witch hunts.” \n\n\n\nThe special master appointment will likely allow him to do the same, further politicizing the FBI search.The FBI search conducted Aug. 8 has kept Trump squarely in the headlines in the lead up to November’s midterm elections.\n\n\n\nThe August raid came after authorities recovered 15 boxes from Mar-a-Lago in January that contained 184 classified documents, including 25 that were marked “top secret,” according to a heavily redacted affidavit that was used to justify the search last month.\n\n\n\nTrump has used the search of his home to solidify support among conservatives, demonizing the FBI and framing the raid as an abuse of power intended to harm his chances of winning the White House again should he run for president in 2024.\n\n\n\nAt a rally with supporters in Pennsylvania on Saturday — his first since the FBI search — Trump decried the bureau and Department of Justice as “vicious monsters” and called the search of his home “a desperate effort to distract from Joe Biden's record of misery and failure.”\n\n\n\nWhile Trump has been happy to attack law enforcement over the search, some in the GOP would likely be relieved to see the fallout from the raid fade into the background with just two months until the midterms.\n\n\n\nTrump remains unpopular with many independent voters, who will be critical in Senate races in swing states like Pennsylvania, Arizona and Wisconsin. President Biden and Democrats have been happy to elevate Trump and his attacks on the FBI to argue many Republicans don’t truly support law enforcement.\n\n\n\nBiden spent the last week making the broader argument that Trump and his supporters are a threat to democracy.\n\n\n\n“There’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans,” Biden said Thursday. “And that is a threat to this country.”",

        "description": "The Rays have activated right-hander Yonny Chirinos from the 60-day injured list, per Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times. Today&#8217;s scheduled starter Drew Rasmussen has been placed on the paternity list. JT Chargois will act as opener, with Chirinos potentially coming in after him. Daniel Álvarez-Montes of El Extra Base first reported that the activation of Chirinos was imminent. The Rays already had a vacancy on their 40-man roster after designating Matt Wisler for assignment yesterday.\nIf Chirinos does indeed pitch tonight, it will be his first time on a major league mound in over two years, as his last appearance was in August of 2020. He underwent Tommy John surgery that month, which wiped out his 2021. He then fractured his elbow in October of last year, which pushed his return even farther down the road.\nPrior to that lengthy layoff, he looked to be establishing himself as a core member of Tampa&#8217;s rotation. He debuted in 2018 with 18 appearances, and though only seven of them were officially starts, the rest featured Chirinos as the bulk pitcher behind an opener. He threw 89 2/3 innings that year with a 3.51 ERA, 20.3% strikeout rate, 6.8% walk rate and 43.7% ground ball rate. In 2019, he got up to 133 1/3 frames, with a 3.85 ERA, 21.5% strikeout rate, 5.3% walk rate and 43.3% ground ball rate. He was only able to make three starts in 2020 before landing on the injured list.\nHe has recently returned to a mound in the minors as part of a rehab assignment. His most recent outing was September 1, when he threw 39 pitches over three innings for the Triple-A Durham Bulls. That means the Rays likely won&#8217;t be able to count on him for a full starter&#8217;s workload as of tonight, but he could certainly factor into their plans in some way.\nThe Tampa rotation has a number of question marks floating around it at the moment. Shane McClanahan was just placed on the IL due to a shoulder impingement a week ago. It&#8217;s possible he could return after his 15-day minimum stay is up, though that still remains to be seen. Assuming Rasmussen returns shortly (paternity list stints are for 1-3 days), then he will jump back into the rotation with Corey Kluber, Luis Patino and Jeffrey Springs. Another wild card factor is Tyler Glasnow, who is also making his way back from Tommy John surgery. Topkin relays that Glasnow is potentially going to start a rehab assignment tomorrow, though he still needs some time to ramp up, with first start planned to be just a single inning.\nAnother factor to consider is the schedule. After playing today and tomorrow, the Rays have Thursday off before embarking on a stretch of playing 18 games in 17 days, thanks to a doubleheader in Toronto on September 13. It will likely be all hands on deck for that stretch, meaning Chirinos could potentially get a few turns through the rotation, even if Rasmussen and McClanahan return promptly. The Rays are currently five games back of the Yankees in the American League East, in addition to holding onto one of three Wild Card spots, tightly bunched up with the Mariners and Blue Jays.",

        "description": "Photo by Dylan Buell/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Get ready to see a lot of the Reds this month. The Cubs have 28 games remaining this season. Nine of those games will be against the Reds, thanks to MLB’s lockout. The final three of those nine, which will also be the last three games of the 2023 season, are games rescheduled from what was supposed to be the opening series this year.\nFor more on the Reds, here’s Wick Terrell, manager of our SB Nation Reds site Red Reporter.\n\nIt’s cold comfort, but at least the Cincinnati Reds had the Colorado Rockies to assuage their baseball playing ills over the weekend. Playing the Rockies has been one of the few things that’s allowed them to actually do a bit of flourishing over the last few months, as serious injuries to their purposefully depleted roster have left them about as threadbare as they’ve been in recent memory.\nThe Reds took two of three from Colorado, for what it’s worth, with a predictable bullpen implosion all that stood in the way of what could have been a series sweep. Thank heavens for the Rockies.\nCincinnati had gone just 7-14 over their previous 21 games prior to that most recent series, however, almost all of which coinciding with the end of Joey Votto’s season to major shoulder and biceps surgery. They lost their veteran rock, even though he’d been playing poorly while injured. They’d already lost Tyler Stephenson, who looks like the guy who’ll replace Votto as the rock in the lineup going forward. They’d lost bright rookie starters Hunter Greene and Graham Ashcraft, too, and the few bright spots we were left to watch during this rebuilding season were mostly turned off.\nThat said, there have been a few glimmers that have emerged, though it remains to be seen just how much of that was due to Rockies pitching. Jonathan India has rounded into the same form that won him last year’s NL Rookie of the Year, hitting .313/.389/.484 over his last 34 games, which rookie Spencer Steer — acquired from Minnesota in the Tyler Mahle deal — hit the ground running last week with a homer and a four-hit game. TJ Friedl has even turned into a bit of a power machine since being recalled, and their work has been what’s fueled the Reds offense of late. The Cubs will be lucky to dodge Nick Lodolo, the lone man standing in the Reds makeshift rotation who looks the part of a long-term cog. He just pitched a gem against Colorado, something he’s been prone to do more often than not of late. \nThis will be no vintage Cubs/Reds series in Wrigley this week, with few recognizable names and little on the line. Still, I get the impression that neither one of these clubs wants to finish in fourth place in the division, which puts at least a little bit on the line this week.\n\nFun fact\nThe Cubs will not see Joey Votto in this series, as he underwent shoulder surgery August 17 and will miss the rest of the season.\nWhen Albert Pujols retires, Votto will become the active player with the most career home runs against the Cubs. He’s hit 48 against the North Siders, his most against any team, and exactly half of those (24) at Wrigley Field, where he will also become the active leader among opponents when Pujols retires.\nProbable pitching matchups \nTuesday: Wade Miley, LHP (1-0, 2.84 ERA, 1.211 WHIP, 3.27 FIP) vs. Justin Dunn, RHP (1-2, 4.63 ERA, 1.371 WHIP, 6.93 FIP)\nWednesday: Javier Assad, RHP (0-0, 0.90 ERA, 1.600 WHIP, 3.72 FIP) vs. Mike Minor, LHP (3-10, 5.98 ERA, 1.530 WHIP, 5.97 FIP)\nThursday: Adrian Sampson, RHP (1-5, 3.95 ERA, 1.330 WHIP, 3.72 FIP) vs. Luis Cessa, RHP (3-2, 5.18 ERA, 1.418 WHIP, 5.48 FIP)\nNOTE: The Cubs website lists “TBD” for the Cubs for some of these games, but I’m going by this tweet from Sunday for this series:\n\n\nCubs rotation for Cincinnati: Miley (off IL), Assad, Sampson. Giving Steele extra time with his back.— Steve Greenberg (@SLGreenberg) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nSteele, of course, is now on the injured list. It’s all subject to change, the reason it says “probable” above.\nTimes &amp; TV channels\nTuesday: 6:40 p.m. CT, Marquee Sports Network\nWednesday: 6:40 p.m. CT, Marquee Sports Network\nThursday: 1:20 p.m. CT, YouTube\nPrediction\nThe Cubs are 6-4 against the Reds this year and have taken two of three in each of the last two series played against them. The Reds are bad on the road — 24-40 — and have lost nine of their last 13 road games. The Cubs will take two of three.\nUp next\nThe Cubs host the San Francisco Giants in a three-game series at Wrigley Field that begins Friday afternoon.",

Android 12L came out in March, so Samsung's update time is clocking in at around six months.\nYesterday, the company announced Android 12L for the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3, which both launched with Android 11 last year. Just before the weekend, Samsung announced Android 12L for its flagship tablet, too, with the Galaxy Tab S8 Series first on deck for updates.\nBoth of these devices are great candidates for Android 12L, since that release was mostly focused on big-screen devices and foldables. The headline feature is the bottom taskbar, which shows icons from recent apps, letting you easily switch between them. There are new split-screen features like the ability to see three apps at once, and you can easily launch split-screen by dragging an app out of the taskbar. There's also a new split-pane notification panel.Read 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge / Archaeologists discovered what may be the skeleton of a 17th-century female \"vampire\" near Bydgoszcz, Poland. (credit: Mirosław Blicharski/Aleksander Poznań)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVampire folklore across cultures is filled with various tips on how to keep a recently deceased person from rising from the grave as an undead fiend who preys on the living. Now archaeologists have uncovered an unusual example of people using these tips in a 17th-century Polish cemetery near Bydgoszcz: a female skeleton buried with a sickle placed across her neck, as well as a padlock on the big toe of her left foot.\nTales of vampire-like creatures date back at least 4,000 years to ancient Mesopotamia. For instance, the Assyrians feared a demon goddess called Lamastu (literally, “she who erases”), who they said killed babies in their cribs or while still in the womb. Other ancient texts mention a similar creature, Lilith—who also appears in Hebrew texts and folklore—who steals away infants and unborn children. Neither of these could be considered “vampires” in the modern sense, but they are the precursors to the Greek legend of Lamia, an immortal monster who sucked the blood from young children.\nIn Chinese folklore, another type of proto-vampire, called the k’uei, were reanimated corpses that rose from the grave and preyed on the living, as were the Russian upir, Indian vetala, Romanian strigoi, and Greek vrykolakas. News reports specifically referencing vampires didn't appear in English until 1732, as suspected \"epidemics\" of vampirism caused a mass hysteria that swept across Eastern Europe. By the 19th century, most of Europe was consumed by vampire hysteria, inspiring writers like John Polidori (\"The Vampyre,\" 1819), Sheridan LeFanu (Carmilla, 1872), and of course, Bram Stoker, whose Dracula (1897) pretty much spawned the modern vampire genre.Read 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

(credit: Hyper)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast-charging the 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro at 140 W isn't something most people need to do that often, but it stands out as a kind of horsepower test among charging accessory brands. Entering into this drag race is Hyper, which is touting a new 140 W wall charger the company claims is 24 percent smaller than Apple's own charger while also sporting two more ports.\nHyper, a sub-brand of Targus that has been making hubs, docks, and charging gear for more than seven years, sometimes through crowdfunding, is using gallium nitride (GaN) technology to achieve improved heat, power, and size characteristics. Apple's original 140 W charger was also built on gallium nitride, has one port, measures 3.78×2.95×1.1 inches (96×75×28 millimeters), and weighs 8.01 ounces (277 grams). Hyper's three-port, 140 W charger measures 2.87×2.92×1.14 inches (73×74.1×29 mm) and weighs 9.03 oz (256 g), according to Hyper.\nHyper's 140 W stacked up against Apple's original 140 W charger. (credit: Hyper)\nFrom that smaller package, you can draw 140 W through a USB Type-C Power Delivery (PD) 3.1 port, 100 W at a USB-C PD port, and 30 W from a Type-A Quick Charge (QC) port. Those are not simultaneous limits; Hyper's product page shows that the full-speed MacBook charging port (which requires Apple's USB-C-to-MagSafe cable) requires solitary operation but can provide 100 W when the other ports are in use.Read 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

(credit: Benj Edwards / Stable Diffusion)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI image generation is here in a big way. A newly released open source image synthesis model called Stable Diffusion allows anyone with a PC and a decent GPU to conjure up almost any visual reality they can imagine. It can imitate virtually any visual style, and if you feed it a descriptive phrase, the results appear on your screen like magic.\nSome artists are delighted by the prospect, others aren't happy about it, and society at large still seems largely unaware of the rapidly evolving tech revolution taking place through communities on Twitter, Discord, and Github. Image synthesis arguably brings implications as big as the invention of the camera—or perhaps the creation of visual art itself. Even our sense of history might be at stake, depending on how things shake out. Either way, Stable Diffusion is leading a new wave of deep learning creative tools that are poised to revolutionize the creation of visual media.\nThe rise of deep learning image synthesis\nStable Diffusion is the brainchild of Emad Mostaque, a London-based former hedge fund manager whose aim is to bring novel applications of deep learning to the masses through his company, Stability AI.

Astronomers call the main feature in this image 30 Doradus, but it has a catchier nickname—the Tarantula Nebula—due to its long, dusty filaments.\nThis stellar nursery is located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, one of the closest galaxies to our own Milky Way at a distance of 160,000 light years. The Tarantula Nebula was already a pretty spectacular feature in telescopes because it's the biggest and brightest stellar nebula in the local neighborhood of galaxies, which includes the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies.Read 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

How can anything, even a six-volume collection of anthologies running more than 200 pages each, live up to that ambition?\n (credit: Jamie McKelvie/Rebellion/2000 AD)After all, it’s not as if 2000 AD is just any comic book series. Launched in 1977, the British weekly has become recognized as one of the most important science fiction titles in comics history—and not just for the characters and stories published, but also for the sheer volume of creative talent that has built reputations thanks to work published in the title. It was 2000 AD that teamed the Watchmen duo of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons for the first time and published important early work by the likes of comic book legend Grant Morrison, current Marvel mainstay Al Ewing, Mad Max: Fury Road writer and visual artist Brendan McCarthy, Gorillaz cocreator Jamie Hewlett, and many more. It’s something that’s been cited as a creative influence by musicians, movie directors, and novelists alike and a long-standing part of British pop culture for nearly half a century. 2000 AD is, bluntly, a big deal.\nWhat is perhaps the most surprising thing about the new Best of series launching later this month is how successfully it manages to deliver on the promise of its title. A significant part of that success comes down to curation. While the six volumes in the collection haven’t been officially separated by theme or any specific criteria, they each have an individual identity that allows them to stand alone for readers looking to pick up just one book for a particular experience.Read 5 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge / PRESS START (credit: Steam Deck HQ)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose who have gotten their hands on the Steam Deck know the portable PC is a handy little emulation machine for the usual range of classic consoles. But the hardware's specific features also make it one of the easiest and most authentic ways to emulate dual-screen consoles like the Wii U and Nintendo DS/3DS lines.\nTrue multi-screen emulation of these specific Nintendo consoles isn't an entirely new concept, of course. Hackers were splitting Nintendo DS emulation across two screens at least as far back as 2013, and Wii U emulator Cemu added support for a second \"GamePad\" window back in 2017 (before going open source and adding a native Linux version just recently).\nBut those kinds of solutions have been a bit awkward, often requiring either unwieldy hardware setups or compromises on some of the consoles' core features.

        "description": "A federal judge ordered that \"Cowboys for Trump\" founder Couy Griffin be removed from his position as Otero County commissioner on Tuesday over his participation in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\n\nNew Mexico District Court Judge Francis J. Mathew found that Griffin had engaged in insurrection during the Jan. 6 riot and was constitutionally disqualified from holding federal or state office, including his current position.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is a historic win for accountability for the January 6th insurrection and the efforts to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power in the United States,” said Noah Bookbinder, the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), in a&nbsp;press release.\n\n\n\nThe watchdog group and several law firms filed lawsuits&nbsp;against Griffin in March, after he was found guilty of illegally entering the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe group alleged — and Mathew agreed — that Griffin violated Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which bars elected officials from “engaging in insurrection or rebellion.”\n\n\n\nEven though Griffin did not personally engage in violence, Mathew said Griffin’s decision to join the mob on Jan. 6 and trespass on restricted grounds constituted insurrection. The judge also said Griffin “normalized and incited violence” before, during and after Jan. 6.\n\n\n\nMathew’s decision represents the first time since 1869 that a court has disqualified an elected official over the insurrection rule, according to CREW.\n\n\n\n“This decision makes clear that any current or former public officials who took an oath to defend the U.S. Constitution and then participated in the January 6th insurrection can and will be removed and barred from government service for their actions,” CREW’s Bookbinder said.",

        "description": "White House officials on Tuesday reiterated calls for new COVID-19 response funding to be approved by Congress as the fall vaccination campaign begins, with officials warning that there are currently not enough resources to respond should a new surge emerge.\n\n\n\nWhite House officials like COVID-19 response coordinator Ashish Jha and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra praised the newly authorized variant-specific booster as safe and effective.\n\n\n\nJoined by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky and President Biden's chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci, the officials said the updated vaccines would soon become widely available to most of the U.S. in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\n\"By the end of this week, over 90 percent of Americans will live within five miles of these new updated vaccines,\" Becerra said. The proximity and availability of the COVID-19 boosters can be searched for on vaccines.gov.\n\n\n\nBecerra, however, remained vague on whether there are enough updated vaccine doses available for whoever wants one when asked about the lack of new funding. The White House previously warned that additional boosters and variant-specific vaccines would not be available for everyone if new funding was not approved by Congress.\n\n\n\nThe White House cut funds from other areas of the COVID-19 response earlier this year in order to continually fund treatments and vaccines.\n\n\n\nBecerra said the possibility of going into the fall and winter without vaccines for Americans was \"unacceptable.\"\n\n\n\n\"We will not have tests in our Strategic National Stockpile should we see another omicron like event,\" Becerra said. \"We had promised the American people we would make sure that we did not get into that, but we needed Congress to step up. Congress has not stepped up.\"\n\n\n\n\"And so while we may have the vaccines today for folks for this fall vaccine effort, we don't know what's coming next,\" Becerra said. We don't know what the next generation of vaccine will look like if we don't have the resources to continue that research going.\"\n\n\n\nA senior White House official said last week the administration will be requesting an additional $22.4 billion to fund the COVID-19 response along with roughly $4 billion to respond to the ongoing monkeypox outbreak.\n\n\n\n“Without additional funding, we will have to make more difficult decisions,” the administration official said.\n\n\n\nJha noted during the briefing that it is \"always more expensive\" to respond to a new development like the omicron wave last winter than it is to prepare in advance. He predicted that if another surge of coronavirus cases comes, then Congress would likely pass another round of funding.\n\n\n\n\"It will cost the American taxpayer twice as much and will be less effective. One of the reasons to be prepared and to be on the front footing ... and to be looking around the corner is it's much more effective and it's much more cost efficient,\" Jha said.",

        "description": "Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, has warned that if Russia were to launch a cyber-attack on Ukraine, the effects&nbsp;could spread to Poland — a NATO member — triggering NATO’s collective defense principle, Article 5, and leading to a larger war.\n\n\n\nUntil recently, cyber was the big threat, and NATO was slow to respond. But it has made great progress over the last decade, including establishing a Cyberspace Operations Centre and designating cyber as a new domain alongside air, land and sea.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow, NATO faces a new threat.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRecent Russian attacks on and around Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, have raised alarm about the prospects of a nuclear catastrophe, whether by intent or ‘accident.’ Such an ‘accident’ will create confusion and is an effective play from Russia’s point of view: It achieves a similar effect as using a tactical nuclear weapon, but has the benefit of plausible deniability.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nScenarios include the nuclear plant taking a direct hit from reckless shelling, fires disrupting the power lines, or the backup generators running out of diesel. In all of these cases, it is a possibility that the cooling mechanism will fail and the nuclear core melt down, similar to what happened at Fukushima. No matter which of these scenarios might unfold, one thing is sure: Russia will blame Ukraine.\n\n\n\nAn&nbsp;International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)&nbsp;“support and assistance” mission arrived at Zaporizhzhia on Thursday. They will assess the safety of the plant and its Ukrainian workers, who have been forced by the Russian occupiers to remain and continue operations. With this visit, which has long been called for by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the UN, comes some comfort that people who know what they are doing are in charge and will report their findings to a world audience. But there remains the risk that Russia will attempt to manipulate the IAEA mission or use their presence to manufacture some crisis.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an ‘accident,’ some think that the winds would blow any radiation towards Russia.&nbsp;Maybe so. But what if they blow in other directions, toward NATO members? What if power loss causes nuclear matter to burn through the structure and straight into the groundwater? These are plausible events. Regardless of how an accident unfolds, nuclear radiation — like cyber — knows no borders, and it is clear that large swathes of Europe’s population could be in harm’s way.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo, what will NATO do?\n\n\n\nNATO's actions since Russia invaded Ukraine have been far more decisive than ever before. Examples are its swift and continuing condemnation of Russia's actions by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg; pledges of tens of billions of dollars in aid for Ukraine — both military and economic — by individual NATO countries;&nbsp;and that over 2 million refugees from Ukraine have been welcomed in NATO countries. Poland is the stand-out and has revised its immigration laws to allow Ukrainians to stay for up to three years and to work without a work permit, and is educating over 400,000 Ukrainian children. Sweden and Finland, countries which have taken pride in their neutrality over many decades, have asked to join NATO and the U.S. Congress has already voted to approve this. There remains a continued focus on the cyber threat.\n\n\n\nThese actions have already had a deterrent effect on Russia, and several more could be&nbsp;taken now in light of the radiation threat:\n\n\n\nCondemn any interference with the IAEA resident mission.Support placing UN peacekeepers in and around the Zaporizhzhia plant as requested by Ukraine.Convene an emergency meeting — and maybe also a G7 meeting — to condemn Russia's actions at the nuclear plant.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who died last week, is credited with winning the Cold War, and proposing to then U.S. President Ronald Reagan that both countries give up their nuclear weapons. Russian President Vladimir Putin brought red roses and paid his respects (live on TV) to the former leader as he lay in an open coffin at the hospital where he died. Despite the fact that they were lifelong ideological enemies, Putin's gesture (though he skipped the funeral) offers some evidence that he wants NATO and the West, where Gorbachev was a hero, to see his humanity. Let’s hope we are not entering a new Cold War with Russia or China, but wouldn't it be wonderful if one day historians credit NATO with heading it off?\n\n\n\nJane Harman is distinguished fellow and president emerita of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

        "description": "One of the most dispiriting aspects of the decision yesterday by Federal District Court Judge Aileen Cannon—which granted former President Donald Trump’s request to appoint a special master to review the evidence seized from Mar-a-Lago by the FBI—is that it undermines the work of all the other judges who have tried to adhere to their oath to “administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and … faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent” on the office. Her ruling is untethered to the law and presents a skewed recitation of the facts. Her actions make the question “Who appointed the judge?” a sadly relevant one in evaluating a judicial opinion.Federal courts, with the notable exception of the Supreme Court, have generally fared well in providing a strong check and balance on attempted executive-branch abuses by Donald Trump. His efforts to have the courts further his bid to overthrow the will of the people in the last election have been rejected by judges nominated to the bench by both parties. The rule of law was on full display; courts around the nation repeatedly revealed a forum where facts, legal precedent, and logical reasoning have pride of place.[Read: America’s judiciary doesn’t look like America]Cannon’s opinion, by contrast, is so deeply flawed that it’s hard to know where to begin a critique. Let’s start with the unequal application of the law. Although Trump wallows in feigned claims of persecution, in fact he has been privileged by the Justice Department, and now Cannon, in a manner unheard of for any other defendant. Every defendant would relish the opportunity to delay a criminal investigation by having a court enjoin the government from investigation, but that never happens. The time-honored recourse for someone aggrieved by a search is not to have an unelected judge unilaterally decide to enjoin the constitutionally delegated power of the executive branch to investigate and prosecute. The defense remedy is in a post-indictment motion to suppress evidence from a search.Cannon addresses the departure from normal practice by inventing a new right for the former president, on the grounds that a post-indictment remedy would be insufficient for him to reclaim his good name. Leaving aside the question of whether her observation about the irreparable consequences of a delay in when he could assert a claim is factually supported, there are at least two other issues with this ruling. First, it is hard to see how her conclusion about harm would or should be cabined to Trump: Why would others under investigation not have the same claim? Is the extra protection of a special master—and the delay it entails—applicable to all public figures? Would we now have a new rule limiting investigations of government officials like Bill Clinton, as well as leaders of large corporations like Enron and Volkswagen and start-ups like Theranos? And if so, how is a rule that offers special privileges to the most advantaged members of our society consistent with providing equal justice for all? Cannon does not deal with any of this. Her ruling, in this respect, resembles the decision of former Attorney General Bill Barr to extend benefits to Roger Stone and Michael Flynn that were simultaneously denied to other defendants. The law, it seems, is simply different for Trump and his close allies.The second problem with this aspect of Cannon’s decision is how completely unnecessary a special master is in this case. A review of potential attorney-client communications applies, at most, to a small subset of documents (no more than 500 or so pages, the filings suggest). These communications would have to be with Trump’s private counsel because he has no attorney-client privilege with the White House Counsel’s Office, which represents the office of the president and not him personally. And it is highly unlikely that any such communications relate to the issue of Trump’s theft and retention of government documents. But even assuming there is a risk that attorney-client communications might be relevant to the investigation, the Department of Justice has a tried-and-true method for dealing with it that doesn’t require a special master.This issue surfaced during Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, which I worked on. When the special counsel received court authorization to search Paul Manafort’s Virginia home, a team of FBI agents who were not part of the special counsel’s investigation, known as a “taint team,” conducted it. That same day, as soon as the search was completed, we called Manafort’s counsel and alerted them that all of the evidence from the search would be made available to them, so that they could review and flag any materials they believed were privileged. The taint team resolved all of the flagged issues, and the process proceeded rapidly and without a hitch. Importantly, it did not require a special master, even though the volume of material (including electronic data, which the Mar-a-Lago search did not uncover) significantly outstripped the volume at issue in the Trump search. But Cannon did not seek to determine whether there were in fact any disputes between the parties about any such documents or explore with the parties the workability of a taint team.[Read: The inside story of Mueller probe’s mistakes]Two other aspects of her decision are also worth noting. Cannon includes within the scope of the special master’s review documents that may raise executive privilege. She does not explain how the former president has the power to assert executive privilege; how executive privilege could restrict documents from being shared with the executive branch (which DOJ is part of); how it could apply to any documents at Mar-a-Lago that emanated from agencies like the CIA, NSA, or FBI; or why it would not be outweighed by the fact that the documents are needed in a criminal investigation (an interest that the Supreme Court found would overcome a privilege assertion by former President Richard Nixon). And even if some of the documents are covered by executive privilege, the documents would, by law, still have to go to the National Archives and not be returned to the person who absconded with them.To understand the illogic of her decision, imagine the following scenario. I rob a bank of $1 million and stash the bags of cash in my hotel room. My gloves and wallet fall into one bag by accident. The police search my hotel room pursuant to a court-authorized warrant that permits seizure of the cash, gloves, and wallet. The judge appoints a special master to review the evidence seized, including every last dollar, even though I have no right to the return of anything that was seized. And she enjoins the criminal case for the duration.But there is more: To support her decision, Cannon misleadingly claims that the current president has not asserted executive privilege. That is a shameful sleight of hand. If she really had a concern about President Joe Biden’s position, she need only have asked at oral argument. She did not. Instead, she engaged in a tortured reading of the evidence that the Justice Department did present to her. A letter sent by the archives to Trump’s counsel in May noted that Biden had authorized sharing the 15 boxes with the FBI and left to the archives the determination as to whether the documents taken from Mar-a-Lago were covered by executive privilege, and that, in consultation with the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, it had decided that this was not a close call and rejected the claim. Her opinion mentions the May archives letter, so we know she was aware of it, but she failed to address it or even note its executive-privilege discussion.Finally, Cannon mercifully carves out the Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s review from the injunction she issued preventing the Department of Justice from using any of the search material in its criminal investigation. She gives no reason why the two should be treated disparately, but presumably it’s because the DNI could not indict Trump. But the work of the DNI is not easily separated from that of the Justice Department—indeed, the DNI’s letter to Congress makes clear that the two agencies are jointly conducting the review. That makes sense because the Justice Department is necessary to that review: To evaluate risks and harms, the DNI needs to know who touched and had access to the documents. It needs Mar-a-Lago visitor records, surveillance records, emails, and copier records, and it needs to interview witnesses. All of that requires grand-jury subpoenas, which also means that Department of Justice lawyers and FBI agents must be involved. And are Attorney General Merrick Garland, a prominent member of the intelligence community, and the experienced Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco supposed to recuse themselves from the DNI review so they can remain on the criminal investigation?These are just a few of the factual and legal deficiencies in Cannon’s decision. It may help Trump in the short term, but by failing to apply the law evenhandedly, she has done lasting damage to the judiciary.",

        "description": "Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Bringing two good relievers back into the fold will give the team a whole bunch of options. It’s a hard time to think of positive things to talk about with respect to the second-half Yankees, but one thing that fans can all take comfort in is the bullpen. Once again a top-five unit in the game, it’s seen rebounds from Jonathan Loáisiga and Clay Holmes. Combine them with the emergence of rookie Ron Marinaccio as a real weapon in high leverage spots, and the ‘pen can be counted on to keep the game close, even as the offense struggled to find its footing.\nThis is going to become more important in the next couple weeks, as the Yankees grapple with how to balance their starters’ inning counts with the need to actually lock up the division and prepare for the postseason. Fortunately, the return of Zack Britton and Scott Effross will give the club additional options down the stretch.\nPer Sunday’s YES broadcast, Effross should be ready to throw a full bullpen by the end of the week, and we’ve already seen what he can do late in games with his slider. In addition to Effross, the Yankees can also expect to welcome Zack Britton back to the major league roster by the middle of the month, after last week’s setback-but-not-a-setback in a rehab outing. He has now made three appearances with Low-A Tampa and is nearing the conclusion of his comeback trail from Tommy John surgery.\nWhat these two bring to the roster is obviously the ability to throw high-leverage innings down the stretch — I’d rather see either man get work over Greg Weissert or Ryan Weber, especially if the division lead continues to shrink — but also the ability to be more flexible with the starting rotation.\nThis comes in tandem with the expected return of Nestor Cortes this week against the Twins, and Luis Severino by the midpoint of September. Despite a two-month absence, Sevy’s still thrown more innings this season than he has since 2018, and Cortes has nearly 40 more frames under his belt than his previous career-high. Not all innings are created equal, and Nestor has certainly had fewer high-stress innings than most pitchers, because he’s been better than most pitchers, but we knew that the Yankees were going to need ways to manage both guys’ workloads in the season’s final month, even with their IL stints limiting their final totals.\nIf we figure that the big three in that pen are Holmes, Loáisiga, and Marinaccio (plus some Lou Trivino and Wandy Peralta here and there), then the Yankees gain even more flexibility. Effross has shown the ability to get critical outs with both the Cubs and the Yankees — I’m not holding one wayward home run against him in 8.1 innings — leaving both him and Marinaccio as fireman options, the first guy out when Severino throws four innings and leaves with multiple runners on. \nI’m not sure what you can expect from Britton after so much time off, but I think he provides a better depth option than Weissert and Weber. He hasn’t thrown more than one inning in an appearance since May of 2019, but his track record obviously gives him the edge over either of the W’s. If Britton’s sinker is anything like it once was, then he’s a guy who could absolutely come in to get a double-play ball in any pivotal moment.\nThe two relievers are likely to play different roles for the team upon their return. Part of this is a function of the amount of time off, part of it the most recent evidence of each guy’s talent level. Still, the Yankees need an injection of flexibility to help manage both Cortes and Severino, and the continued success of the bullpen is both expected and welcome for a team in as much turmoil as this one.",

        "description": "The Tigers have claimed infielder Luis García off waivers from the Phillies, according to announcements from both teams. Garcia has been optioned to Double-A Erie. The Tigers already had a vacancy on their 40-man roster after designating Michael Pineda for assignment on Sunday.\nGarcia, not to be confused with the Luis García of the Nationals or the Luis García of the Padres or the Luis Garcia of the Astros, is a 21-year-old infielder who had spent his entire career in the Phillies&#8217; organization up until now.\nHe made his professional debut in rookie ball in 2018, just 17 years old at that time. He hit a tremendous .369/.433/.488 in 43 games, showing enough promise to crack Baseball America&#8217;s list of the top 100 prospects in the sport. BA placed him #88 going into 2019. However, García struggled immensely in A-ball that year, hitting .186/.261/.255 and losing his spot on BA&#8217;s list.\nAfter the minor leagues were canceled by the pandemic in 2020, he had a bit of a bounceback in 2021, hitting .243/.353/.414 between A-ball and High-A, walking in 13.8% of his plate appearances and stealing 15 bases. That was enough for the Phillies to add him to their 40-man roster in November, protecting him from the Rule 5 draft that ended up getting canceled by the lockout.\nUnfortunately, it&#8217;s been another downturn here in 2022, with García hitting .167/.316/.253 across four different levels on the year. Based on that poor showing, he lost his roster spot on the weekend, now landing with the Tigers, who are likely intrigued by García&#8217;s approach. Despite his poor batted ball results, he&#8217;s still walking in 15.6% of his plate appearances this season. For reference, the MLB average is 8.2% this year, meaning García is nearly doubling that pace. Struggles aside, he still came in #16 on BA&#8217;s most recent update of top 30 Philly prospects. Their report notes that he&#8217;s a plus defender at shortstop, meaning that he could be a valuable piece so long as his bat improves.\nFor the Tigers, this is a no-cost way of adding to their system, picking up a prospect who&#8217;s definitely lost some shine in recent years but still has some intriguing tools. Since they are well out of contention, they can use their open roster spot to take a flier on García and hope that he can help them down the line.",

        "description": "Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  JR Ritchie was one of three big name prep arms the Atlanta Braves grabbed in the 2022 MLB draft When the Atlanta Braves went underslot on their first round picks they made it clear they were going to chase higher end talent in lower rounds, and they did that a few picks later when they drafted JR Ritchie out of Bainbridge High School in Washington. The right handed arm was the lone Braves draftee present at the MLB draft and has since joined the organization and made four starts. Ritchie made a strong impression with 4 1⁄3 scoreless innings in the Florida Complex League which earned him the call up to Single-A Augusta at the end of Augusta. Ritchie’s first start went without a hitch as he pitched four scoreless innings, but he had more trouble his second time out and only managed to get through two innings. \nRitchie in his professional outings has attacked the strike zone with his low-to-mid 90’s fastball, but in the prep ranks touched as high as 99 mph and could add velocity more consistently in the future. Right now the Braves don’t have him working there likely for a few reasons, the primary one being that he struggled to maintain that velocity for more than a couple of innings in the amateur ranks and needs to add strength to improve his stamina. They also don’t want to over exert him at the end of a long season for him and likely see more importance to focusing on improving his command and delivery. Ritchie has short extension in his delivery and with that he tend to have ride up in the zone but give hitters a longer look at all of his pitches. Getting his legs a bit more involved could be one of the first steps in Ritchie’s career as that weakness along with some effort in his arm action explains much of the issue with him maintaining his velocity.\n\n\npic.twitter.com/qmcnjgeqa4— Garrett Spain (@BravesMILB) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nRitchie’s curveball needs more refinement to be a consistently effective pitch, and it has been one of the reasons he hasn’t posted fantastic strikeout rates in his short career. As an amateur we saw him break off some high spin curveballs and sliders, but the iteration of this pitch we’ve seen in Augusta has had less refined spin. The velocity gap on the pitch creates a good tunnel, but the pitch doesn’t fool hitters consistently and hasn’t shown the ability to miss even Single-A bats consistently. His changeup shows flashes of promise with some deep fade, though it can get a bit firm out of the hand. Ritchie matches his fastball’s arm speed well and for a prep arm his changeup is in a good place right now even if it’s not at a level to produce present results consistently.\n\n\npic.twitter.com/0w2m9KP8bo— Garrett Spain (@BravesMILB) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/lLdu3rgqlj— Garrett Spain (@BravesMILB) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nArm talent for Ritchie is his real calling card, but he has a lot of refinement left to get his game to the next level. His delivery limits the effectiveness of his pitches in the looks it gives to hitters and may also be contributing to some of his stamina problems. It also isn’t the cleanest arm action and that shows as he has struggled with his command in two starts with Augusta. While he is able to fill up the zone he hasn’t necessarily been hitting his spots though he hasn’t always been far off. Overall his stuff should play well when he keeps his fastball up and the next steps for him are all about developing consistency with all of his pitches. Ritchie isn’t a player I look to move fast through the system and may see some lumps early in his career, but he certainly has the upside of a middle-of-the-rotation starter. He could be perhaps more if his high school velocity can feature more often in games.",

        "description": "The brothers behind the British watch company Creamy Patina, have created The Wilsdorf Collection, an elegant yet very convenient series of cufflinks that also act as working miniaturized timepieces.  The brothers, Dr. Imran Haq and Emto Haq have worked with watches for a long time.\n\n\n\nAt Creamy Patina, we&#8217;re two brothers who live and breathe watches. We&#8217;ve been collecting and repairing vintage watches ever since we can remember, and now we&#8217;ve translated all our experience into making iconic watches, tiny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea for miniaturizing iconic watches came to them while they were separated due to their separate work during the pandemic.\n\n\n\nBy day one of us is a Surgeon, and the other a Biochemist. During the COVID19 pandemic and the first lockdown in 2020, the Doctor was serving on the frontline, having to live alone in splendid isolation. To while away the time, and forget about the horrors of work he set about designing and making tiny versions of his grail watches. His brother, the Biochemist, thought they were pretty cool and when they reunited again, decided to make the prototypes a reality &#8211; resulting in The Wilsdorf Collection.\n\n\n\nThe Haqs raised funds through a successful Kickstarter campaign, and each style can be ordered directly through their site.\n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Creamy Patina (@creamypatinawatches) \n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Creamy Patina (@creamypatinawatches) \n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Creamy Patina (@creamypatinawatches) \n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Creamy Patina (@creamypatinawatches) \n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Creamy Patina (@creamypatinawatches) \n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Creamy Patina (@creamypatinawatches) \n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Creamy Patina (@creamypatinawatches) \n\n\n\nsubmitted via Laughing Squid Tips",

This would render much of the discussion about resource licensing moot, though it creates a whole range of issues about access to the technology and eights over the data and resources the AI would use (as has already happened with image-generating AIs). Anyhow, this article described what such a system might look at, as it describes an AI that generates a quality video as a result of text-based input. I can imagine using such a system with my Anticosti resources and simply describing the narrative I would like the videos to follow.\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

I think there's more to it than this, though there's certainly an anti-achievement sentiment in some educational environments.\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

Apple is also facing a BRL$12,275,500 fine (about $2.3 million) from Brazil's Ministry of Justice and Public Security (MJSP). This is on top of a reported $2 million fine Apple incurred in 2021 after announcing its first smartphone to ship without a power adapter in the box, the iPhone 12 series. Apple can appeal Brazil's decision.\nThe MJSP also ordered the iPhone 12's registration with Anatel, Brazil's national telecoms agency, to be canceled.\nIn 2021, the Brazilian state of São Paulo's consumer protection agency, Procon-SP, fined Apple $2 million over the iPhone 12. It said Apple sold what the country considers to be an incomplete product. Since then, Apple hasn't worked to \"minimize the damage and continues to sell cell phones without chargers,\" according to a Google translation of the announcement in Portuguese.Read 12 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

(credit: Jonathan Gitlin)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPorsche provided flights from DC to Daytona Beach and back, plus a night in a hotel so we could attend its private 963 test. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.\nDAYTONA BEACH, FLA.—Car companies like to keep new models far from prying eyes during the development process. That goes doubly so when they’re going racing, like Porsche is with its new 963, which made our invitation to watch the car test on Friday, while still in development, a rare chance to watch expertise at work. Doubly so considering that Porsche's partner with the 963 is Penske Racing, an organization that has racked up more than 600 wins across a range of disciplines over the past 56 years.\nThe 963 has been built to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans and endurance races like it and will compete next year in IMSA's new GTP category as well as the FIA WEC's Hypercar class. Built to a rule set known as LMDh, it's more of a collaboration than the Porsche crest on the nose might lead you to expect. Multimatic in Canada provides the car's carbon-fiber spine, or chassis. Xtrac supplies the transmission, Williams Advanced Engineering provides the lithium-ion traction battery, and Bosch is responsible for the electric motor/generator unit, all three of which are tightly packaged together.\nBut Porsche has built the twin-turbocharged 4.6L V8, which traces its roots back to the mid-2000s RS Spyder race car, with a road-going derivative also found in the 918 Spyder hypercar. Power is capped at 680 hp (500 kW) for the internal combustion engine and hybrid system working together and is measured by sensors to ensure no one gets over-creative.Read 17 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/android-snore-cough-detection-digital-wellbeing-update",
        "description": "Google&#8217;s 2nd generation Nest Hub integrated something called Sleep Sensing using its onboard Soli chip back when the device first shipped, and this feature allowed the smart display to detect sleep patterns like how long you rest, the quality of that rest, and more. Additionally, something called &#8220;Cough and snore detection&#8221; came with that, making it easy to see (with a Fitbit Premium subscription, of course) how you could improve your well-being while your conscious mind slumbered.\n\n\n\nWith that being a thing, Google is now seeking to extend that same functionality to Android, as we reported back in May. Well, 9to5Google has unearthed new code strings in the latest Digital Wellbeing app (version 1.2.x) on handsets that indicate that it&#8217;s finally on its way.\n\n\n\nVia its APK Insights report, 9to5 says that &#8220;Cough and snore detection&#8221; will become a part of &#8220;Bedtime mode&#8221; on Android, which seems fitting since it&#8217;s meant to operate while you&#8217;re asleep and should be set up or activated manually prior to the time when you call it quits for the evening.\n\n\n\n&lt;string name=&#x201D;cough_and_snore_awareness_notification_content&#x201D;>See how much you cough or snore during your scheduled bedtime&lt;/string>APK Insights, 9to5Google\n\n\n\nYou heard that right &#8211; detection for your nightly nasal habits must be activated by you, and can not be toggled automatically. This is likely because it requires microphone permissions to listen to you while you slumber, so it&#8217;s important that you&#8217;re aware of when your privacy is being willfully invaded. Just keep in mind that the detection will only occur during those hours you&#8217;ve previously specified in the app.\n\n\n\nAnother code string discovered shows that you will be able to view sleepy statistics once you come back to in the morning. Things like how many times you&#8217;ve coughed and the average time you spent snoring can help you prove to your significant other that you&#8217;re not crazy, or to seek help from your doctor for your apnea if they&#8217;re in fact correct about your habits.\n\n\n\n&lt;string name=&#x201D;cough_and_snore_wind_down_promo_card_message&#x201D;&gt;Customize your display, automatically turn on Do Not Disturb, and track coughing and snoring during your scheduled bedtime&lt;/string&gt;APK Insights, 9to5Google\n\n\n\nAt this time, there&#8217;s no way of knowing if this feature will be exclusive to Pixel phones or if it will be rolled out to all Android users running the latest version of the app, but we&#8217;ll likely find out soon enough. As there&#8217;s no guarantee that APK Insights will lead to released features, it more often than not indicates that they will, and more importantly, that they&#8217;re just a fortnight or so away.\n\n\n\nI have to be honest and say that as a millennial, the idea of letting our technology listen to us while we&#8217;re unconscious and collect data on us &#8211; even if it is for our benefit &#8211; feels a bit dystopian. It&#8217;s Just a funny thought as we watch smart home technology evolve. I remember a movie back in the early 2000s called Smart House on the Disney Channel that dealt with a similar topic, and I think that so long as we maintain control over our privacy and such we&#8217;ll be fine, but the more control we give away and the cozier we become with such things, the less weird it may feel to us. Perhaps there are some boundaries technology shouldn&#8217;t cross (and some curfews), but that&#8217;s just my tinfoil hat speaking.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "After World War II, you heard from some Germans: “I never knew such things were going on. I am a good person. If I knew, I would have done something.”\n\n\n\nThis article takes away that argument from you. Now you will know. Then I hope you will engage in the November election to ensure Republicans do not win any political office this year.\n\n\n\nThe big culprit of course is the stoker of the Big Lie. Every time Trump spreads the falsehood that he won the 2020 election, he drives another stake into the heart of our democracy. Republican leaders and candidates who do not condemn his Big Lie are despicably complicit in his attack on our democracy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Republican Party uses voter suppression legislation and gerrymandering to weaken democratic freedom. They ignore the findings of the January 6 Committee, and instead of learning from the failed coup attempt to prevent another one, they use the facts uncovered as a springboard to engineer a possible successful coup in 2024. They now champion candidates for governors and election-controlling secretaries of state who believe the Big Lie so that they can subvert the presidential election in 2024 exactly as was tried in 2020.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Republican Party stands with fascist white supremacists. At the recent CPAC convention, the guest of honor was Hungarian fascist strongman Prime Minister Viktor Orban who spouted his anti-immigrant white supremacist ideology to thunderous applause. Who else champions this moral rot? Republican candidate for governor of Pennsylvania Doug Mastriano. He too spreads the Big Lie, spouts Christian nationalist ideas, and has ties to Gab, a far-right social media platform with antisemitic commentary, and its founder Andrew Torba.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRemember Charlottesville? The neo-Nazi “Unite the Right” terrorists who marched shouting ”Jews will not replace us” were praised by Trump as being part of “the good people on both sides.” During the campaign, Trump called out to the white supremacist Proud Boys “Stand back and stand by” as he hoped to use them as a force for obstructing the peaceful transition of presidential power on the attack on the Capitol on January 6. Sure enough, they were there. As the January 6 Committee uncovered, Trump knew that some of the Capitol attack mob were armed, but he still directed them to the Capitol because he believed they would not harm him. What other “good people” were on Trump’s side that day?&nbsp; Well, eleven right wing extremist Oath Keepers were charged with sedition in their role in the attack on the Capitol on January 6.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe FBI warns of the growing threat of domestic terrorism caused by these right wing hate groups. FBI Director Christopher Wray testified to Congress in 2021 that the number of domestic terrorism investigations increased from around 1,000 when he became director in 2017 to about 2,000 in 2020. The number of arrests of white supremacists and other racially motivated extremists has almost tripled.\n\n\n\n\nThree Weeks After #PA01 @RepBrianFitz Voted Against Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, @DHSgov Warns of Heightened Domestic Terror Threat | Democratic institutions, candidates, election events &amp; election workers are in the crosshairs. #BucksCounty READ: https://t.co/r3CXnNVw22 pic.twitter.com/3HgNAL6zVr&mdash; BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) June 8, 2022\n\n\n\n\nEleven Jews were gunned down in the Pittsburgh Tree of Life synagogue by a person radicalized by the white nationalist ideology of the radical right. The murderer was deeply involved in posting antisemitic conspiracy theories on social media websites such as GAB. Ten Black shoppers gunned down in a grocery store in Buffalo, 23 Hispanics gunned down in a Walmart in El Paso, and hate crimes against Asian-Americans on the rise across America: all fueled by racist white supremacy ideology.\n\n\n\nRepublicans plot a national campaign of a phony culture war about sex and race with CRT nonsense and homophobic hysteria about gender. Now local school boards are under attack with vitriol and outrage leading to the banning of books.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a conservative packed Supreme Court takes away reproductive freedom from women ushering an era of state-forced births even on victims of rape and incest. The all powerful State trumps women’s freedom while Republicans, the alleged party of small government and individual freedom, applaud.\n\n\n\nHmmm. A demagogue expert at manipulating the media with his lies and divisive hate speech fails his first coup and continues to seek power, laying the groundwork with his complicit Party leaders for another power grab. Right wing hate groups multiply. Jews are gunned down while they worship. Books are banned. Propaganda machines issue their own version of alternative facts. Remind you of anything?&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nNEW: “Doug Mastriano is a Clear and Present Danger to Democracy” by @jennycohn1. Please consider supporting local papers like the @BucksCoBeacon https://t.co/MR82yHw2Nc&mdash; Mueller, She Wrote (@MuellerSheWrote) June 29, 2022\n\n\n\n\nSo let’s talk about Germany under Hitler.\n\n\n\nGermany was a democracy before Hitler came to power. In a country suffering from the economic trauma of World War I that led to soaring inflation and unemployment, Hitler used his communication skills and control of the media to demonize scapegoats such as Jews and communists and extol the racial purity of the Aryan race. Note that the first of many Nazi book burning events focused on books about homosexuality and transgender topics. He promised a defeated Germany that he alone could restore the glory of Germany (in effect promising to make it great again). The cost of empowering this demagogue was the transformation of a democracy into a fascist state, countless deaths and destruction in yet another world war, and the horrific inhumanity of the Holocaust.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n.One of the themes in the film Judgment at Nuremberg was the allocation of responsibility for the devastating consequences of Hitler’s Third Reich. An American judge is sent to Nuremberg after the war to try ordinary citizens possibly guilty of complicity in the evils perpetrated by the Nazi regime. The film shows him beset by various pressures and perspectives. Some are political (The United States now needs Germany to be on its side against the USSR in the Cold War so it is pragmatic to let bygones be bygones and not risk angering the German people anymore). Some&nbsp; are issues of fact (Did the defendants on trial actually know what the consequences of their actions would be?)&nbsp; Some are personal (A wife of a Nazi general who was executed for war crimes tries with a little flirting to convince the judge that German high culture is so civilized, that good things are being done now for and by the German people, that former atrocities were not known by the general public, and that we must focus on building a better future for all instead of rehashing the past.)\n\n\n\nBut when the judge sees in the courtroom the films of the horrors of the concentration camps, he then comes to the realization of the idea of the silent complicity of the ordinary German and the more general philosophical idea that we are all in some sense responsible for each other. In a very apt scene, the wife of the Nazi general brings the judge to a happy restaurant where the German folksong Du, du liegst mir im Herzen is being sung wildly over and over again by ordinary Germans in a drunken frenzy. In the song the lover pleads with his beloved that she is causing him great pain by not understanding how good he is to her. He sings “Du, du machst mir viel Schmerzen,weißt nicht wie gut ich dir bin.” (You, you cause me much pain, you don&#8217;t know how good I am for you.)&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nDoug Mastriano tries to escape &quot;extremist&quot; label while calling Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol &quot;distant&quot; and &quot;detached from reality.” Now the @PAGOP #Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate is actually suing the #Jan6Committee. Read more: https://t.co/1MAoY41bdJ pic.twitter.com/56imdGwUFj&mdash; BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\n\nThe irony is biting. Germans boldly and loudly profess their virtue while objecting to the pain someone will cause them due to their blindness to their alleged goodness.\n\n\n\nBut the judge then does recognize exactly how good the German people were during the Third Reich and now feels justified in causing them much pain by sentencing all the defendants to life sentences in prison.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nToday in the United States ugly fascist strains are running rampant through the Republican autocrat-loving book-banning Party, you know exactly what is going on. So how good will you be for America? \n\n\n\nYes, our democracy is under attack, our religious and reproductive freedoms are under attack, and our physical safety is under attack. You can choose either to be blissfully ignorant with silent complicity or rise to the occasion and do your part to stem these attacks in November.\n\n\n\nShow the world how good you truly are and participate in the political process this fall to ensure Democrats get elected. End this fascist epidemic and do your part this November to put us back on the journey to making real the American ideals of democracy, freedom, and equality for all.",

        "description": "From praise for Boris Johnson, to blaming Putin for energy price rises, here is what we can gather from her brief addressLiz Truss’s first speech as prime minister was brief, but her every utterance will be pored over for clues about her plans when the UK is facing crises on multiple fronts.Here are four key takeaways from her carefully crafted address:Let me pay tribute to my predecessor. Boris Johnson delivered Brexit, the Covid vaccine, and stood up to Russian aggression. History will see him as a hugely consequential prime minister. I’m honoured to take on this responsibility at a vital time for our country.Now is the time to tackle the issues that are holding Britain back. We need to build roads, homes and broadband faster. We need more investment and great jobs in every town and city across our country. We need to reduce the burden on families and help people get on in life … I will take action this week to deal with energy bills and to secure our future energy supply.We will transform Britain into an aspiration nation, with high-paying jobs, safe streets and where everyone everywhere has the opportunities they deserve. I will take action this day, and action every day, to make it happen … We shouldn’t be daunted by the challenges we face. As strong as the storm may be, I know that the British people are stronger. Our country was built by people who get things done.We now face severe global headwinds caused by Russia’s appalling war in Ukraine and the aftermath of Covid … I will deal hands-on with the energy crisis caused by Putin’s war.

        "description": "A firm that agreed to merge with the parent company of former President Trump’s social media platform Truth Social failed to receive enough support from its shareholders to extend the amount of time it has to close the deal, according to Reuters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nReuters reported on Tuesday that people familiar with the matter said Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) did not receive the necessary support from 65 percent of its shareholders to extend the proposed deal by 12 months. \n\n\n\nDWAC said in a court filing last month that the success of the deal will depend on the “reputation and popularity” of Trump, who serves as the chairman of Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which owns Truth Social. \n\n\n\nThe filing set a special shareholder meeting on Tuesday to discuss extending the Thursday deadline to complete the merger by one year. DWAC will dissolve if the extension is not approved. \n\n\n\nReuters reported that the transaction has been in jeopardy amid civil and criminal investigations into the circumstances of the deal. DWAC has hoped that the Securities and Exchange Commission would sign off on the agreement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRegulators are seeking information on the relationships between DWAC and other entities, its board meetings, policies and procedures related to trading and certain investors’ identities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe deal had received support from far fewer shareholders than the number needed to meet the threshold for approval, according to Reuters. DWAC executives do not expect they will receive enough shareholder support and are exploring alternatives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne of the options is to delay the voting deadline to try to increase support from shareholders.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTMTG said in a statement to The Hill that Truth Social is continuing to grow “rapidly” through “extraordinary user engagement” and the recent launch of ads on the platform.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“TMTG will continue cooperating with all stakeholders in connection with its planned merger, and hopes the SEC staff will expeditiously conclude its review free from political interference,” the statement reads.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDWAC did not immediately return a request from The Hill for comment.",

        "description": "Hillary Clinton on Tuesday hit back at comparisons between her use of a private email server while secretary of State and former President Trump's handling of classified documents found when the FBI searched his Mar-a-Lago residence last month.\n\n\n\n\"I can’t believe we’re still talking about this, but my emails...\" Clinton said in a&nbsp;Twitter thread, referring to scrutiny she has faced since her 2016 presidential bid, when then-candidate Trump and other Republicans made it a focus of their campaign against her.\n\n\n\n\"[Former FBI Director James] Comey admitted he was wrong after he claimed I had classified emails. Trump’s own State Department, under two different Secretaries, found I had no classified emails. That's right: ZERO,\" Clinton wrote.\n\n\n\n\"By contrast, Trump has hundreds of documents clearly marked classified, and the investigation just started,\" Clinton wrote.\n\n\n\nNewly unsealed records show FBI agents found more than 100 classified documents at the Palm Beach, Fla., resort during the early August search, as well as dozens of empty folders marked as classified. \n\n\n\nTrump's possession of the documents at his Mar-a-Lago home after leaving office has raised questions about potential violations of the Presidential Records Act, which requires such records be preserved and turned over to the National Archives. \n\n\n\n\"As Trump’s problems continue to mount, the right is trying to make this about me again,\" Clinton wrote on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nShe knocked the GOP's references to the \"Clinton Standard,\" the argument now touted by a number of Republicans that because Clinton didn't face prosecution for her handling of documents, Trump shouldn't either.\n\n\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) wrote on Twitter last week, \"Democrats and the FBI created the Hillary Clinton standard for non-prosecution of mishandling classified information. Will Donald Trump be held to a different standard?\" \n\n\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) warned in a Fox News appearance that \"if there’s a prosecution of Donald Trump for mishandling classified information, after the Clinton debacle … there’ll be riots in the streets.\"\n\n\n\nAfter news of the FBI's search, Clinton touted \"But Her Emails\" merchandise, poking fun at the former president.",

        "description": "Former President Trump will hold a rally in Ohio later this month boosting Republican Senate nominee J.D. Vance in the latest sign that Trump is ramping up his political activity ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n\n\nThe rally will take place in Youngstown, Ohio, on Sept. 17 and will feature an appearance by Vance and “the entire Ohio Trump Ticket,” the former president’s leadership PAC, Save America, announced on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe announcement comes just three days after Trump campaigned in Pennsylvania for Republican Senate nominee Mehmet Oz and gubernatorial hopeful Doug Mastriano.\n\n\n\nThe rallies also come as several of Trump’s endorsed Senate candidates have struggled to get their general election campaigns off the ground and keep pace with their Democratic rivals in fundraising.\n\n\n\nIn Pennsylvania, recent polling shows Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the Democratic Senate nominee, leading Oz, while Vance’s Democratic rival, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), has begun to close in on the Trump-backed author and venture capitalist, despite the state’s rightward shift in recent years.\n\n\n\nSimilar situations are playing out in other battleground states, including Georgia and Arizona. The struggling Republican campaigns have alarmed some top GOP officials, who worry that several untested candidates could cost them their chance at winning back the Senate majority this year.",

        "description": "The Broadway legend, who has won more Tony awards than any other performer, on what ‘the American songbook’ means to her“I’m trying to get to the truth of why I’m singing this song,” says Audra McDonald, the stage and television star who has won more Tony awards than any other performer. Speaking on a video call from her home near New York City, McDonald is dressed down – with horn-rimmed glasses and a polka-dot head scarf – but later this month she will dress up to front a 40-person orchestra at the London Palladium, singing selections from “the American songbook”.What that constitutes can be a vexed question. (Answers usually involve white men, Duke Ellington excepted.) What it means to be American and to represent American culture, these are tough ones, too. But McDonald, 52, has enlarged the notion of what that songbook can sound like, what American excellence can look like. As a Black woman commanding stages that have not always welcomed Black women, she delivers these songs with an open heart and expansive soprano, transmuting midcentury classics into something fresh. “A specific song changes through my vessel,” she says.

        "description": "Ron Brownstein: &#8220;President Joe Biden assembled his winning Electoral College majority in 2020 by flipping five states that had supported Donald Trump four years earlier: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin across the Rust Belt and Georgia and Arizona in the Sun Belt.&#8221;\n&#8220;In November, voters in all five of those states will render verdicts on candidates virtually hand-selected by Trump in Republican primaries &#8212; including the GOP Senate nominees in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona and gubernatorial nominees in all five states, except Georgia (where Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who is up for reelection, has feuded with the former President).&#8221;\n&#8220;Across these tipping-point states, the success or failure of Republican candidates who are cast so firmly in the Trump mold may offer important insights about the viability of the former President himself in 2024. If most of these nominees running on Trump-style messages lose this fall, even in an environment that favors Republicans overall, it would raise serious questions about Trump&#8217;s ability to recapture these critical states in 2024.&#8221;",

I’m not suggesting that this year’s chair of judges, art historian and former museum director Neil MacGregor, keep some loose change in his back pocket, but every book on the 2022 shortlist is a serious contender for the prize. Short of coin-tossing, arm-wrestling and plucking a name from a hat in a blind panic, I’ve no idea how we’ll pick a winning book from this spectacular final six.In alphabetical order, the 2022 shortlist begins with NoViolet Bulawayo and her fabulist animal allegory, Glory: a furious, funny and energetic story set in the fictional animal kingdom of Jidada (read: Zimbabwe) as it surfaces from decades of dictatorship. Bulawayo captures the hope, dismay and disarray that follows the toppling of a tyrant. The animal cast includes Robert Mugabe as a doddery old horse and Donald Trump as a tweeting baboon. Bulawayo writes with an exhilarating anger and her surreal imagination puts the Dada into Jidada. It’s been touted as a Zimbabwean Animal Farm, but Glory equally draws from a rich tradition of African storytelling in which animals articulate the deepest truths of our societies.

        "description": "Stadia&#8217;s white label service called &#8220;Immersive Stream for Games&#8221; has been a thing for a while now, and since the shock has died down that the company was not solely focused on the consumer, its B2B solution has gone on to become a powerhouse for letting third parties demo content to their customers using Google&#8217;s infrastructure.\n\n\n\nBesides AT&amp;T with both its Batman: Arkham Knight and Control demos that are being used as promotional tools for its wireless customers, there is one other primary example of Immersive Stream being used by another company. A few months back in June of this year, game publisher Capcom provided a Stadia-driven Resident Evil Village demo through its own website so that its users could get a taste of cloud gaming without having to even invest in the Stadia branding or visit the platform directly.\n\n\n\nBecause nothing lasts forever, Capcom just announced on its Twitter account that the demo would soon be taken off of its website on September 8, 2022, at 5 PM PST. That&#8217;s just two days from now, so if you were hoping to play through the village and the castle to get a sense of how the game plays, you should do so before it&#8217;s too late!\n\n\n\n\nThe &quot;Resident Evil Village Online Streaming Demo&quot; is available until Sep. 8th 5 pm PST (Sep. 9th 0:00 UTC)! One click is all you need to play instantly so get a taste of the Village and Castle before the time&#39;s up!https://t.co/iyfNLeGsWu#REVillage&mdash; Resident Evil Village Streaming Demo Status (@REStreamingDemo) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\n\nIt&#8217;s worth noting that the official Stadia Store demo for Resident Evil Village will remain available (unless Google states otherwise within the next few days) and you can play it with one click even after Capcom&#8217;s website scrubs it from existence. We&#8217;re not sure why the company has decided to do this, but maybe it will provide a new demo in its place for gamers to test out and this is all just a standard promotional swap out.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;Screening for cancer can take a long time, depending on the necessary tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiopsies may be necessary for diagnosis, such as for lung cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobotic-assisted bronchoscopy is a new, less invasive option for taking lung biopsies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting screened for cancer is a stressful experience for patients and may be stretched over months if multiple screenings are needed to finally reach a diagnosis. For some cancers, biopsies — where physicians take tissue samples to see if the cells are cancerous — are necessary to be certain. In a breakthrough, doctors can perform biopsies for lung cancer more easily using a robotic-assisted technique. \n\n\n\nTypically, patients are screened for lung cancer using a CT scan. This involves lying down inside a machine and the scan is turned into 3D images of the lungs. The doctors examine the images to see if there are abnormalities, like masses in the lungs. If cancer is suspected after a CT scan, the patient would have to wait for an appointment with a surgeon to perform a procedure to retrieve a biopsy, or sample, from the lung tissue in question. \n\n\n\nRobotic-assisted bronchoscopy involves using a flexible bronchoscopy tube that is controlled by the physician. This tube is smaller than what would normally be used in a traditional bronchoscopy, according to the American Lung Association. A 3D map from a CT scan helps them navigate the lungs and find the cancerous masses or nodules. \n\n\n\nIn May, doctors at University of California Davis Health were the first to perform a robotic-assisted bronchoscopy procedure, according to a press release. They were able to diagnosis early stage lung cancer in a patient, mark the nodules for removal and remove cancerous lung tissue, all in the same day, using this technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore health clinics are starting to offer this service, which is a less invasive way to get a tissue sample. This technology could also shorten the length of time patients need to wait between getting a biopsy and diagnosis and having a procedure to remove the cancerous material. \n\n\n\n“Waiting months between a biopsy and a diagnosis can be an emotionally difficult and exhausting experience for patients,” said Chinh Phan, who is the director of the UC Davis Interventional Pulmonology Program, in the press release. “By utilizing the robotic-assisted bronchoscopy platform we can help reduce the anxiety and unnecessary waiting times that patients traditionally experience.” ",

        "description": "The Broadway legend, who has won more Tony awards than any other performer, on what ‘the American songbook’ means to her“I’m trying to get to the truth of why I’m singing this song,” says Audra McDonald, the stage and television star who has won more Tony awards than any other performer. Speaking on a video call from her home near New York City, McDonald is dressed down – with horn-rimmed glasses and a polka-dot head scarf – but later this month she will dress up to front a 40-person orchestra at the London Palladium, singing selections from “the American songbook”.What that constitutes can be a vexed question. (Answers usually involve white men, Duke Ellington excepted.) What it means to be American and to represent American culture, these are tough ones, too. But McDonald, 52, has enlarged the notion of what that songbook can sound like, what American excellence can look like. As a Black woman commanding stages that have not always welcomed Black women, she delivers these songs with an open heart and expansive soprano, transmuting midcentury classics into something fresh. “A specific song changes through my vessel,” she says.

        "description": "By Carol Tannenhauser\nTwo words when combined have long elicited cries of ecstasy from Upper West Side schoolchildren (if not always their parents): &#8220;Snow Day!&#8221;\nSnow days were days of sleeping late, bundling up, then heading out to the park to sleigh ride, build snow people, or push a giant snowball. Snow days were days of play.\nCentral Park Sisyphus.\n&#8220;Sorry, kids, there are technically no more snow days,&#8221; said NYC School Chancellor David C. Banks, in an interview on Fox News on Tuesday, laughing as the newscasters squealed in dismay. Then he added a chilling addendum, &#8220;It&#8217;s gonna be good for you!&#8221; He explained that children would continue to learn by engaging in remote instruction when public schools were closed for bad weather.\n“That sounds very un-fun,&#8221; said a local first grader. &#8220;When will I get to wear my pink snowsuit?”\n“Our cousins will be so sad,&#8221; said her older sister. &#8220;We love going to the park to sled since we go to different schools. We get to play when it’s a snow day.”\nEven their mother was against the new decree. &#8220;Seems like a lose-lose for families. Parents still have to stay home or find coverage, and now can’t even have fun with their kids in the snow!”\n&#8220;New York State law mandates that students must attend class 180 out of 365 days, which means the switch to a digital alternative to canceling school altogether allows schools to meet the mandate,&#8221; amny explained.",

        "description": "Ian Kennedy pitched in the 9th inning on 3 September. | Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The impact of closing by committee was likely positive. August was a whole new ballgame for relief pitching. \nFirst, Torey Lovullo talked about a problem:\n“We’ve got the find a way to get those outs late in the game, leverage or no leverage, it doesn’t matter. When you come out of the bullpen you need to get outs. And if you’re not we’ve got to make some sort of adjustment.” — Torey Lovullo 5 August, earlier in the day.\nHow I heard/interpreted his comment was that when a closing pitcher enters a game (in a save situation OR a non-save situation), he needs to pitch well. Pitching well in non-save situations was an issue with Mark Melancon.  This season, in 13 games he entered the game with the score tied.  At least one run was scored against him in 11 of those games.        \nLater that day, Torey Lovullo announced a different way to decide who closes games. \n“We’re gonna back into a situation where we don’t have one closer at this point. Had a discussion with Mark about making this move and he understood. He didn’t necessarily like it but he understood for the good of the team. If it was a decision I was making then he was going to support it. For right now, it’ll be a fluid situation who it will be. It will be undetermined. It will mostly be matchup based.” — Torey Lovullo, 5 August later in the day.\nHow I heard/interpreted his comment was August would be different. Instead of a primary closer, the closing pitcher would be determined by matchups against with that day’s batters.  Two thoughts follow:\n\nI wondered whether the advantage of better matchups would exceed the specialized skill of a primary closer.\nWho Torey picks for each game’s closer would impact all relief pitching because in planning a game, Torey Lovullo said he works backwards from the ninth inning.\n\nDid the Diamondbacks transform a closer problem into a competitive advantage by closer-matchups? The answer is in the data for relief pitching in August. August was a new ballgame!\nWho was the best pitcher in the last inning?\nThe following table shows results for the last Diamondback inning pitched in each game during August.  The table shows Mark Melancon, Ian Kennedy, and a group of 6 other relievers (I excluded last inning relief pitched by catcher Carson Kelly).  \n  \n        \n      Last Diamondback Inning Pitched, August 2022.  Data from Baseball Reference.\n  \nSaves.  Ian Kennedy had more saves and more save opportunities than Mark Melancon (5 of 6 vs 4 of 5).  During August, the others had no save opportunities, although for the season they collectively had zero saves in 6 save opportunities. \nOn-Base-Percent (OBP)-against.  Ian Kennedy had a better OBP-against than Mark Melancon (.278 vs .367).  As a strong indication that matchups matter, the other 6 pitchers had the best OBP-against (.214).\nGot-The-Job-Done (GTJD).  Relievers GTJD if they allowed zero earned runs and allowed zero inherited runners to score.  Ian Kennedy had a better GTJD than Mark Melancon (78% vs 75%).  The other 6 pitchers has a GTJD of 75%.\nAllowed Built Innings (when 5 batters reach the plate).  Ian Kennedy had a lower (which is better) percent of allowed built innings (33.3% vs 37.5%).  As a strong indication that matchups matter, the other 6 pitchers had 27.3% allowed built innings.\nHow good was relief pitching in the ninth inning?\nAs a team in August, the Diamondbacks .319 wOBA was slightly worse than the .310 average in the Majors per Baseball Savant.  \nIn the ninth inning of August games, two Diamondback pitchers had wOBA better than  August’s .310 average in the Majors (3 pitchers with 3 PAs each were not mentioned due to small sample size):\n\nMark Melancon, .267 wOBA in 25 PAs.\nIan Kennedy, .303 in 40 wOBA PAs.\n\nThree thoughts/observations follow:\n\nIn the context of his overall .344 wOBA in August, Melancon’s .267 wOBA in the ninth was encouraging because the Diamondbacks have a contract with Melancon for next season.   \nMost pitches for Kennedy (96%) and Melancon (69%) were thrown in the ninth inning.\nNext season, Ian Kennedy will be a free agent.\n\n\nHow good was relief pitching in the eighth inning? \nAs a team in August, the Diamondbacks .340 wOBA was significantly worse than the .298 average in the Majors per Baseball Savant.\nIn the eighth inning of August games, two Diamondback pitchers had wOBA better than August’  .298 average in the Majors(4 pitchers with 2 or 3 PAs each were not mentioned due to small sample size):\n\nEdwin Uceta, .126 wOBA in 7 PAs.\nJoe Mantiply, .154 in 30 PAs.\n\nTwo thoughts/observations follow:\n\nThis season Joe Mantiply was named as the Diamondbacks’ All-Star.\nJoe Mantiply pitches left handed, and Edwin Uceta pitches right handed. \n\nHow did relief pitching in August compare to previous pitching?\nAs a team the Diamondbacks relief pitching (position = RP per Baseball Savant) wOBA was worse in August compared to previous pitching (.334 wOBA in August vs .318 wOBA in the season through July).  Although there were many factors that impacted that comparison, especially different relievers pitched, it’s very possible that at least part of the difference reflected the change in game planning caused by the new approach for picking the closer.  In other words, choosing the closer based on matchups possibly made overall relief pitching wOBA worse, but other factors made it unclear.  \nThe following table shows the individual pitcher’s wOBA in August compared to previous pitching.  Moronta’s previous pitching was for the Dodgers and the August pitching was Diamondbacks only (excluded August games for Dodgers).\n  \n        \n      Diamondbacks relief pitchers in August 2022.  Data from Baseball Savant.\n  \n\nThe first six pitchers in the table had an wOBA better than .310, August’s average in the Majors.  It is significant that all six pitchers except Ian Kennedy improved in August compared to earlier in the season.  My conclusion is that choosing the closer based on matchups likely made the best six relief pitchers’ wOBA better.  \nSummary.\nTorey Lovullo needed his closer to get outs in all late game situations.  The problem was when his closer entered tied games, he allowed runs in 11 of 13 games.  Therefore in August he implemented closer by committee.  One possible benefit was better matchups that would improve relief pitching.    \nIn August, as a team, Diamondbacks pitching in the ninth inning was nearly average in the Majors, while Diamondbacks pitching in the eighth was significantly worse than average in the Majors.\nIn August, who was the best pitcher depended on the situation:\n\nIn the last inning pitched in each game, Ian Kennedy was the best pitcher.\nIn the ninth inning, Mark Melancon was the best pitcher.\nIn the eight inning Joe Mantiply was the best pitcher.\n\nIn August, the impact of closing by committee was likely positive: \n\nWhen Ian Kennedy’s pitched in the last inning of a game, the results appeared better than the alternative.  \nThe six pitchers with the best wOBA improved compared to earlier in the season.\nOverall relief pitching wOBA worsened compared to earlier in the season, but that worsening may have been due to other factors.",

        "description": "Photo by Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Jesús Luzardo and Aaron Nola will start Tuesday’s Marlins vs. Phillies game at Citizens Bank Park. Full lineups and game notes in here. Welcome to Tuesday’s Marlins (55-78, -92 RD) vs. Phillies (73-61, +65 RD) game thread. Another loss would match the longest losing streak of Don Mattingly’s Marlins tenure (eight games). There is rain in the forecast that could interfere with the contest.\nIt’s the opening game of a new series, which means we’ve got free prop bets and an hour-long livestream with the Fish Stripes staff and special guests.\n\n\nUse this Fish Picks link prior to every Marlins series to submit your predictions. The eighth inning of the contest has just begun and it runs through September 15. \n\nMarlins Game Notes\n\n\nMarlins Starting Lineup\n\n2B Jon Berti (108 wRC+ this season, 84 wRC+ over last 30 days)\n3B Joey Wendle (82, 67)  \nLF Brian Anderson (97, 65)\nRF Avisaíl García (68, N/A) \nDH Garrett Cooper (105, 26)\nC Nick Fortes (111, 88)\nCF JJ Bleday (94, 111) \nSS Miguel Rojas (70, 33)\n1B Lewin Díaz (39, 36) \n\nLHP Jesús Luzardo (118 ERA+ this season, career 87 ERA+) \n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n      Luzardo’s 2022 pitch distribution and Statcast percentile rankings\n  \n\nLineup Changes from Previous Game: Berti, Bleday, Díaz and García in, Peyton Burdick, Jerar Encarnación, Charles Leblanc and Jacob Stallings out; Anderson switches from RF to LF, Fortes switches from DH to C, Cooper switches from 1B to DH\nPregame Roster Moves: OF Avisaíl García returned from rehab and activated from the injured list; OF Peyton Burdick optioned to Triple-A Jacksonville\nAdditional Notes: Even I, as somebody who’s been a big advocate for Burdick, can admit that this demotion was warranted. Strikeouts were predictably an issue, but he didn’t make enough quality contact to compensate for that. See ya in spring training...This might be the first time in franchise history that the Marlins’ starting first baseman in batting ninth in the starting lineup? Hard to disagree with it considering Díaz’s mediocrity at the plate...Rojas (.688 OPS in 33 PA) and Anderson (.766 OPS in 31 PA) have the most head-to-head history with Aaron Nola among active Marlins players. \n\nPhillies Starting Lineup\n\nLF Kyle Schwarber (120, 119) \n1B Rhys Hoskins (126, 108)\n3B Alec Bohm (104, 94)\nDH Bryce Harper (163, 133)\nC J.T. Realmuto (123, 147)\n2B Jean Segura (113, 134)\nCF Matt Vierling (74, 56)\nRF Dalton Guthrie (N/A, N/A) \nSS Edmundo Sosa (60, 71)\n\nRHP Aaron Nola (118 ERA+ this season, career 116 ERA+) \n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n      Nola’s 2022 pitch distribution and Statcast percentile rankings\n  \n\nNotes: The only Phillies regular who has truly struggled against Marlins pitching this season is Bryson Stott (.139/.184/.194, 10 K in 38 PA)...The 26-year-old Guthrie is making his major league debut. In 92 games at Triple-A this season, he has a .302/.363/.476 slash line (123 wRC+) with 10 home runs and 21 stolen bases.\n\nHow to Watch/Listen/Follow\nFirst pitch is scheduled for 6:45 p.m. ET. Watch on Bally Sports Florida or listen to the radio broadcast on Fox Sports 940 Miami. Out-of-market fans can stream the game on MLB.TV.\nNoah Berger is representing Fish Stripes in Philadelphia as a credentialed reporter. Follow him on Twitter (@Trainboy100) for in-game updates.

If you don’t already know about the GBH Archives Twitter account, I’m about to make your online life just a little bit more delightful. \nEvery day or so, the account Tweets out a short clip from GBH’s vast video library. Sometimes it’s something important and newsworthy, like this clip of Noam Chomsky getting real about the Monroe Doctrine: \n\n\nNoam Chomsky and then-BU President John Silber have a lively debate on aid to the Nicaraguan Contras in March 1986. pic.twitter.com/PPwtxTOkOb— GBH Archives (@GBHArchives) August 22, 2022\n\n\n\nMore often than not, though, the account just posts small, slice-of-life vignettes that serve no greater purpose than reminding us of just how much change accumulates over the years, like this clip of the last ride of the old elevated Orange Line:\n\n\nLast ride on the Orange Line El through Boston's South End in April 1987. pic.twitter.com/oqMo2dFyUn— GBH Archives (@GBHArchives) August 4, 2022\n\n\n\nToday, they gave us something that always makes me smile: Bill Lee playing baseball.\n\n\nA previous @gbh At Home series was broadcast in 1978. One episode featured the Spaceman himself, former Red Sox pitcher Bill Lee, seen here playing ball with neighborhood kids in Belmont, MA. pic.twitter.com/7GGi9Lk15s— GBH Archives (@GBHArchives) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nI think it’s quite possible that Bill Lee enjoys playing baseball more than anyone else on Earth enjoys doing literally anything else. Cheers to the Spaceman.",

        "description": "Hillary Clinton said in a new interview that she believes former President Trump encouraged and led a seditious conspiracy that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\n\n\n“I would not be honest if I didn't say I think there was a seditious conspiracy against the government of the United States, and that's a crime,” Clinton told CBS News’s Norah O’Donnell.\n\n\n\n“Led by Donald Trump?” O’Donnell interjected.\n\n\n\n“Led by Donald Trump, encouraged by Donald Trump,” Clinton responded.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton and her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, sat down with O’Donnell to promote their forthcoming Apple TV+ docuseries, “Gutsy.” \n\n\n\nPortions of the interview will air Tuesday night on O’Donnell’s new streaming show, “Person to Person,” while other parts are airing on the network’s newscasts.\n\n\n\nThe former presidential candidate and secretary of State portrayed Trump’s actions as running counter to her work on behalf of America promoting democracy and the peaceful transfer of power across the globe.\n\n\n\n“Was I happy when I beat Donald Trump by nearly 3 million votes but lost the Electoral College?” Hillary Clinton said in the preview clip. “No, I was not happy.”\n\n\n\n“Did I even for a nanosecond think I'm going to claim victory and try to get the Democrats to refuse to certify the election? No,” she continued.\n\n\n\nThe events of Jan. 6 have remained in the headlines this summer with a series of public hearings held by  the House select committee investigating the attack and related efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.\n\n\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has doubled down on his unfounded claims of voter fraud, recently saying he would look “very seriously” at pardons for Jan. 6 defendants if he returns to the White House.\n\n\n\nIn previously released clips of the Clintons' interview with O’Donnell, Hillary Clinton revealed that “suggestive” photos taken of her led her to begin wearing pantsuits, which became a staple of the ex-first lady’s fashion.\n\n\n\nShe also told O’Donnell how staying in her marriage to former President Clinton was the “gutsiest” thing she’s ever done, after the former president’s affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky was revealed.\n\n\n\n“Well, it was, in terms of my private life, it was really hard,” she told O’Donnell. “And as you know, everybody had an opinion about it. People who I never met had very strong opinions about it.”",

I think Donald Trump is. I think the vast majority of his supporters are not.\" \n\n\n\nMost Trump supporters, the former aide argued, \"are good people who want an economy that works for them, who saw more money in their paycheck under Donald Trump.\" \n\n\n\nDuring a fiery speech in Philadelphia last week, Biden branded Trump and the segment of the Republican party that has embraced his false claims of a stolen election in 2020 as an affront to democracy and America more generally.\n\n\n\n“Not every Republican, not even a majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology,” Biden said. “But there’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.”\n\n\n\nCritics have blasted Biden over the tone and content of the speech, which some have called divisive and partisan. But he continued the theme in speeches over the weekend.\n\n\n\n\"I think Biden wants to be a uniter,\" Griffin said. \"But I don't think that speech was uniting.\" \n\n\n\nFarrah Griffin was hired by ABC alongside pundit Ana Navarro to fill a seat on \"The View\" vacated by Meghan McCain, another conservative voice in media and frequent critic of Trump. \n\n\n\nShe has pushed back on suggestions that she has changed her political beliefs to score media deals and public notoriety. \n\n\n\n“I hope I’ve evolved. I hope I do the rest my life,” she said in a string of tweet earlier this year. “I pride myself first &amp; foremost in being a an American. The political labels will always be secondary to me.”",

That inquiry remains for another day,” she wrote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ruling directs both parties to “meaningfully confer” and together craft a filing with a list of potential candidates who could serve as a special master as well as a proposal outlining any limitations on their review.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfter a pointed legal battle, it's not clear who Trump’s legal team and the DOJ might agree on, but the candidates will likely need a high-level security clearance in order to review the roughly 300 classified records recovered.\n\n\n\nThe ruling does not lay out a deadline for the special master to complete their review — though the DOJ has indicated its team was able to filter through all the evidence in two weeks.\n\n\n\nThe ruling impacts two different investigations&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ruling blocks the DOJ from continuing its criminal investigation into Trump’s handling of records at Mar-a-Lago until the special master can complete their review.\n\n\n\nAs a result, at a minimum, it's a temporary setback for the Justice Department just as it has recovered another 100 classified documents from Trump’s Florida home.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA special master more sympathetic to Trump’s broad views on executive privilege could lead to key evidence being withheld from the investigation.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department has argued Trump has no claim to any of the documents, noting that anything protected by executive privilege would therefore belong to the government and should be maintained by the National Archives. Trump had roughly 10,000 government records at Mar-a-Lago that contained no classification labels.\n\n\n\nCannon’s ruling does allow the intelligence community to continue its separate review of the documents taken from Mar-a-Lago — a tranche that includes some 184 classified documents turned over in January, another 38 turned over by Trump’s team following a May subpoena and the 100 more confiscated in August.\n\n\n\nBut critics worry the limitations on the Justice Department could hamper the review led by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which is set to assess the potential fallout from the alleged mishandling of the documents as well as the risks to national security.\n\n\n\nIt’s a task that has become only more pressing since a DOJ inventory unsealed by Cannon revealed that among the evidence were numerous empty folders that once held classified documents as well as materials designated to be returned to the military. The revelation has&nbsp;raised questions&nbsp;about whether those materials were found elsewhere in the boxes and if they have been accounted for.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt also complicates matters for the FBI, one of the 18 agencies overseen by the ODNI.\n\n\n\n“The FBI’s investigation and the Intelligence Community (IC) assessments are inextricably intertwined from a counterintelligence perspective,” Brian Greer, a former CIA attorney, told The Hill by email.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“To assess the risks, it’s important for the IC to know who accessed a given document, and they can only get that from the FBI. But if the court prohibits the FBI from accessing certain classified documents because they might be subject to an executive privilege claim, that process will break down,” Greer added. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nA highly unusual decision\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most controversial part of Cannon's ruling is the provision granting the special master the power to determine if any of the seized documents are protected by executive privilege — an authority typically reserved for the president.\n\n\n\nThat stipulation has created a highly unusual scenario in which Trump, while no longer a part of the executive branch, could claim executive powers over the existing Justice Department — pertaining to documents that federal law suggests should belong to the government.\n\n\n\nFormer Attorney General William Barr, who served under Trump, has said that while some of the seized documents might be protected by attorney-client privilege, his ex-boss has no right to claim executive power over the others as a private citizen. That's particularly true, Barr said, when it comes to sensitive material.\n\n\n\n“All the other documents taken, even if they claim to be executive privilege, either belong to the government because they're government records — even if they're classified, even if they're subject to executive privilege, they still belong to the government and go to the Archives,”&nbsp;Barr told Fox News last week.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I can't think of a legitimate reason why they should have been — could be taken out of the government, away from the government, if they're classified,” Barr said.\n\n\n\nTrump’s effort to keep government documents after leaving office is not unprecedented: Nixon also challenged the powers of government archivists to retrieve presidential papers and tape recordings after he’d exited the White House. Nixon lost that challenge in a landmark 1977 Supreme Court case, on which the Justice Department has leaned this year in arguing against the appointment of a special master.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCannon rejected the DOJ’s argument, writing that the 1977 decision “did not rule out the possibility of a former President overcoming an incumbent President on executive privilege matters.” Trump might ultimately fail in his effort to shield certain documents by executive privilege, she said, but he at least has the right to try.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Even if any assertion of executive privilege by [the] Plaintiff ultimately fails in this context, that possibility, even if likely, does not negate a former President’s ability to raise the privilege as an initial matter,” Cannon wrote.\n\n\n\nDOJ has to weigh appeal and whether to let ruling stand&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department could appeal Cannon’s ruling — but in doing so must weigh a number of factors.\n\n\n\nAn appeal, especially one seeking to block Cannon’s decision, would eat up time and continue to subject the department to claims of politicization as Trump rails against the investigation.\n\n\n\nBut not taking action carries its own risks, particularly when it comes to the precedent that could be laid out in the ruling with regard to executive privilege and the ability of litigants to use civil suits to stall criminal investigations.\n\n\n\nSpecial masters are commonly used to help screen for any evidence that might be covered by attorney-client privilege, but asking one to weigh executive privilege concerns is new territory.\n\n\n\nCannon’s ruling devotes remarkably little time to weighing the DOJ’s arguments in the case when it comes to the national security implications of the investigation — both its own and, most particularly, the review being carried out by the ODNI.\n\n\n\nBeyond an appeal, the DOJ could take other less commonly used approaches, including filing motions for clarification or reconsideration as a way to expand on its argument that a special master could hamstring national security efforts.\n\n\n\nRare win for Trump in a bad month&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor Trump and his followers, Monday’s ruling was a rare glimmer of light in a stormy month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe FBI’s remarkable search of Mar-a-Lago on Aug. 8 was a humiliating episode for the former president, revealing that he had hoarded troves of government documents — including many alleged to be highly classified — even after his lawyers had assured the DOJ that all such materials had been returned to the National Archives earlier in the year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA day later, a federal appeals court ruled that Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee should be granted access to Trump's tax returns, ending a years-long standoff over the disputed records.\n\n\n\nAnd just one day after that, Trump was deposed in Manhattan by New York's attorney general, who is conducting a wide-ranging investigation into Trump’s finances and business dealings. He pleaded his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 400 times.\n\n\n\nThe back-to-back episodes highlighted the simmering legal troubles facing Trump as he weighs another run at the White House in 2024. In Cannon’s decision to appoint a special master — a move that has, at the very least, delayed the criminal investigation into his handling of documents — Trump found a unique reason to celebrate. He did so, in part, by blaming the “fake news,” Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans for his predicament.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“All American Patriots know that I always do everything ‘by the book’ and that this Hoax will fail miserably,” he said Tuesday in an email blast soliciting donations to his PAC.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCannon’s ruling does not mean Trump is out of the woods. Kel McClanahan, executive director of National Security Counselors, a nonprofit law firm specializing in national security law, previously told The Hill there are ways a special master could ultimately backfire for Trump.\n\n\n\nHe noted a special master could easily decide the FBI did not obtain any materials that should be protected by either attorney-client or executive privilege, as Trump is asserting, undercutting a major argument for a former president who often likes to claim he’s been treated unfairly.\n\n\n\n“He won’t be able to say, ‘The DOJ privilege review team wrongfully decided it.’ He’s going to have to say, ‘The DOJ privilege review team, and the subject matter expert that I asked for, and a federal judge wrongfully decided it,’” McClanahan said.\n\n\n\n“And in an area like this where there’s not a whole lot of room for him to be right — that’s a very risky move,” McClanahan added.",

        "description": "Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R) said that he is open to numerous long-term options in an effort to restore the city of Jackson, Miss., water system, adding that privatizing the system is “on the table.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“As we turn to long-term problems in the future, I want to clarify a few things: There are indeed problems in Jackson that are decades old, on the order of $1 billion to fix,” Reeves said during a press conference on Monday. “The crisis we intervened to solve is not one of those problems.”\n\n\n\n“Privatization is on the table,” Reeves added.&nbsp;“Having a commission that oversees failed water systems as they have in many states is on the table. I’m open to ideas.”\n\n\n\nReeves also said that the city’s water system has made major improvements in the past week. Officials informed him that an old water plant is pumping out clean water for the first time in decades, according to the Mississippi Free Press. \n\n\n\nReeves said that his hope is to remove the boil water advisory for Jackson within days. \n\n\n\nFlooding had exacerbated existing problems in Jackson, leaving 150,000 residents in the city without potable water to drink. The most immediate cause of the problem was flooding from the Pearl River that ran into the streets and caused problems at the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant. \n\n\n\nHowever, the city's water system has had problems for some time, including a lack of clarity in the water, leaks and line breaks in the city's distribution system, and broken monitoring equipment, among other things. \n\n\n\n“We know that it is always possible that there will be more severe challenges. This water system broke over several years, and it would be inaccurate to claim it is totally solved in the matter of less than a week,” Reeves told reporters. \n\n\n\n“… There may be more bad days in the future. We have, however, reached a place where people in Jackson can trust that water will come out of the faucet, toilets can be flushed and fires can be put out.”\n\n\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell said in an interview on Sunday that there is no timeline for when city residents will have access to drinkable water. \n\n\n\n“I think it’s still too early to tell,” Criswell told host Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union,\" adding that officials' main focus now is to get bottled water out to city residents affected by the outage. \n\n\n\n“I think that having EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] and the Army Corps of Engineers — we had a really good conversation on Friday about what it’s going to take in the assessments that they’re doing,” Criswell added.",

Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe religious school, operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which does not recognize same-sex marriage, was praised by students and LGBTQ+ advocates in 2020 when it removed a rule from its Honor Code that banned “homosexual behavior.”\n\n\n\nJust three weeks later, however, officials clarified that students in same-sex relationships who engaged in public displays of affection like hand-holding or kissing would be subject to disciplinary action.\n\n\n\nStudents and community members say they dressed as angels not only to protect LGBTQ+ students from protesters, but also to push back against the university’s policies.\n\n\n\n“I’m doing this because I want our LGBTQ community to feel like they can be themselves and know we have their backs,” Sabrina Wong, a BYU student and ally who stood as one of the angels, told the Salt Lake Tribune.\n\n\n\nLate last month, LGBTQ+ student groups including the RaYnbow Collective, an off-campus organization that supports BYU’s LGBTQ+ community and organized Saturday’s Pride event, said the university had removed resources for queer students from welcome bags given to first-year students.\n\n\n\nThe groups in a statement said the school’s decision “follows a consistent pattern of BYU breaking its promises and agreements with LGBTQ+ students.”\n\n\n\n“No student should feel alone, and no student should feel rejected by their university because of their identity,” the groups wrote.\n\n\n\nTodd Hollingshead, a spokesperson for BYU, at the time said the university “loves and welcomes” its LGBTQ+ students and employees.\n\n\n\nStudents on Saturday challenged that claim, comparing the chants of the protesters at Kiwanis Park to the stigma and contempt they often face on campus.\n\n\n\n“This is the kind of stuff we have to deal with here,” Carolyn Gassert, the president of Understanding Sexuality, Gender, and Allyship (USGA), told the Salt Lake Tribune. “It’s not just tonight. We hear these comments in the classroom.”In February, the Education Department dropped an investigation into BYU over its controversial ban on same-sex relationships, claiming the university is entitled to a number of exemptions from Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination, because of its religious affiliation.",

        "description": "(NEXSTAR) — Despite how excited a few social media posts may have gotten you for the return of all-day breakfast at McDonald's, don't make your way to the drive-thru just yet.\n\n\n\nIn a written statement to Nexstar, a McDonald's representative said the information being shared online is actually from a 2015 press release, when McDonald's USA first announced all-day breakfast. \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMajority of Millennials, Gen Zers who moved home during COVID-19 pandemic still live there: survey\t\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't have any updates to share about breakfast offerings at this time,\" the representative said.\n\n\n\nMcDonald's' all-day breakfast was halted in March 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the company made adjustments to simplify operations for local workers. The original 2015 rollout of all-day breakfast was a boon for McDonald's, with the company saying the change was a \"very strong catalyst for momentum.\" McDonald's posted higher-than-expected first-quarter earnings in 2016, much of which was attributed to the popularity of its breakfast, CNBC reports.\n\n\n\nSo what time does McDonald's stop serving breakfast now? \n\n\n\nPrior to 2015, McDonald's stopped serving breakfast at 10:30 a.m. Since the end of all-day breakfast, that time has been re-instated, though some locations may serve breakfast until 11 a.m.\n\n\n\nMcDonald's' breakfast menu is home to some of America's fast-food breakfast faves, including the Egg McMuffin and the Bacon, Egg and Cheese Biscuit. \n\n\n\nBreakfast at McDonald's 101\n\n\n\nThe company officially added the breakfast line to menus nationwide in 1977, Mcdonald's says. The full line came about after a long development of the Egg McMuffin, which began in early 1971.\n\n\n\nAccording to McDonald's owner Ray Kroc's 1977 autobiography, local franchise owner Herb Peterson developed the sandwich and asked Kroc to try it. Kroc says Peterson refused to tell him what it was -- fearful the owner would reject the idea -- until after he'd tried it.\n\n\n\n\"He didn’t want me to reject it out of hand, which I might have done, because it was a crazy idea — a breakfast sandwich,\" Kroc writes in \"Grinding it Out: The Making of McDonald's.\" \"... I boggled a bit at the presentation. But then I tasted it and I was sold. Wow!\"\n\n\n\nEgg McMuffins — the first McDonald's breakfast item — were tested in select locations in 1972 and priced at 63 cents.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/3631077-biden-tarnished-his-democracy-speech-with-partisan-rhetoric/",
        "description": "President Biden’s effort at a statesmen-like warning of imminent threats to U.S. democracy was well-intentioned. Yet his important appeal was sullied by conflating millions of voters with the GOP politicians and their media/social media perpetual grievance machine and by touting his own political agenda, veering into the partisan lane.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor starters, when 250 election deniers (a sad euphemism for embracing a self-serving political fiction over hard factual evidence) win GOP primaries, Biden’s fear of a polarized, tribalized America heading off a cliff can’t be dismissed. The Founding Fathers would be scratching their heads at how the leaders of a major political party could consciously reject facts, embrace what they know to be lies and then base “reform” of the election process on that fantasy.\n\n\n\nBiden would have done well to remind Americans of the overwhelming evidence: Trump filed and lost 61 lawsuits, and many of the appeals were rejected by GOP-appointed judges, the conservative Supreme Court and Republican state election officials. That would be one heck of a conspiracy.\n\n\n\nThe peaceful transfer of power is a fundamental principle of democracy. It is what separates democracy from autocracy. That core principle is what made the first attack on the nation’s capitol since 1812 by a Trump-inspired insurrectionist mob so disgraceful.\n\n\n\nBut democracy requires a shared national purpose and a common set of facts. Without facts, democracy is not possible. Yet many Republican legislators in the House, the Senate and state houses reject factual evidence and base their politics and identity on a contrived fiction invented by a narcissistic ex-president who can’t accept losing.\n\n\n\nThis is where Biden’s partisan detour begins. It is one thing to criticize the leaders – ambitious, opportunistic GOP senators and representatives, many with Harvard and Yale law degrees – for denigrating the rule of law and deriding institutions, from the electoral process to the FBI. But it is quite another to place tens of millions of Trump voters in that category.\n\n\n\nAn appreciable number of those voting for Trump previously voted for Obama. The numbers are estimates, but upwards of 40 percent of voters are independents, center left to center right. The failure of the political class to address the nation’s major problems has led to growing disaffection and alienation.\n\n\n\nTo lump these millions of voters together as “MAGA Republicans” is too simplistic, not to mention politically unwise. It is reminiscent of  Hillary Clinton’s dismissive comment during the 2016 campaign that many Trump supporters were “a basket of deplorables.” In contrast, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wy.) argued that Trump and his congressional acolytes “misled millions of voters” by lying about the 2020 elections.\n\n\n\nIn any event, the point is that Biden’s partisan rhetoric tarnished the credibility of his “soul of the nation” theme that was otherwise well argued. It would also have strengthened his case had he referred to authoritarian tendencies of some on the left in the Democratic Party as well.\n\n\n\nBiden’s listing of his administration’s legislative achievements and his agenda added to the speeches unnecessary partisan tinge. It’s not that Biden doesn’t have a compelling list of legislative achievements but rather that they belong in a separate speech.\n\n\n\nThese flaws notwithstanding, the evidence of imperiled democracy mounts in at least 19 states that have changed the electoral process, making it more difficult to vote and passing new laws potentially enabling state legislators to overturn election results. The evidence mounts of threats and attacks on election workers and even Republican state officials from Arizona to Georgia who defied the “Big Lie.”\n\n\n\nPerhaps most troubling is that the drumbeat of lies about alleged rigged elections and purported fraud are destroying faith in the election process itself. Call it what you will, but assaults on reality and efforts to delegitimize institutions are the classic preludes to authoritarian rule, from Putin’s Russian and Erdogan’s Turkey to Orban’s Hungary.\n\n\n\nFor as one Russian author, explaining Putin’s methodology, has put it, if “nothing is true, then everything is possible.” \n\n\n\nRobert A.

        "description": "Former President Trump once tried to pay a lawyer with a horse, New York Times reporter David Enrich revealed in his new book, according to The Guardian. \n\n\n\nTrump offered the lawyer, whom he owed $2 million, the deed to a stallion, Enrich reported in “Servants of the Damned: Giant Law Firms, Donald Trump and the Corruption of Justice,” out next week.\n\n\n\nThe unidentified lawyer, from a law firm that worked for Trump in the 1990s, visited the former president at Trump Tower after he refused to pay, according to The Guardian.\n\n\n\n“Trump made some apologetic noises. Then he said: ‘I’m not going to pay your bill. I’m going to give you something more valuable,’” Enrich wrote, per The Guardian.&nbsp;The former president then “rummaged around in a filing cabinet” and pulled out a deed to a horse supposedly worth $5 million.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Once he regained the capacity for speech,” the lawyer reportedly said, “This isn’t the 1800s. You can’t pay me with a horse,” Enrich wrote, according to The Guardian.\n\n\n\nAfter the lawyer threatened to sue, Trump eventually paid “at least a portion of what he owed,” Enrich wrote, according to The Guardian. \n\n\n\nTrump has racked up extensive legal fees in the last few years in the face of personal litigation and government investigations, according to&nbsp;ABC News.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Republican National Committee (RNC), which has paid nearly $2 million to law firms representing the former president since October 2021, recently threatened to stop paying Trump's legal fees if he announces another run for president, an RNC spokesperson recently told the network. ",

Wade and the nearly 50-year constitutional right to abortion as well as for other cases reforming laws around gun control and religion in public government.\n\n\n\nPolling last month revealed Democrats' approval of the Supreme Court dropped to 13 percent, down from 36 percent in September 2021.\n\n\n\nRoberts is a conservative justice who agreed with the Dobbs v. Jackson case that upheld a 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi, but he disagreed with overturning Roe v. Wade, which enshrined abortion as a constitutional right.\n\n\n\nRoberts also took the spotlight this year when he ordered an investigation into the leak of a draft opinion that previewed the Supreme Court overturning Roe V. Wade.\n\n\n\nMinear has had a long career with the legal system, working before he became a counselor for the Office of the Solicitor General of the United States, where he argued 56 cases before the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nRoberts in a statement said, \"Minear has exemplified the finest tradition of Court staff.\"\n\n\n\n\"He has brought deep knowledge, outstanding judgment, and a tireless work ethic to court management and improvement,\" the chief justice said. \"I am grateful for the many years he has served so well as my counselor and as an officer of federal judicial administration.\"",

        "description": "A recent picture of a child in front of her destroyed home in eastern Ukraine.\nBy Irwin Redlener and Karen Redlener\nOn September 1, children across war-torn Ukraine returned to school &#8212; or at least that was the goal. The reality, however, is that some two out of three of the country’s children have been forced from their homes by a brutal war that has rained terror on their communities. Apartment buildings bombed. Schools and hospitals destroyed. Families dodging missiles and bullets in mad attempts to find food and safe water.\nA destroyed school in Lviv.\nMany children in Ukraine &#8212; and those who fled the country altogether &#8212; have missed the last half year of the 21-22 school year. Yes, we know that disrupted school has been part of what’s happened around the world during the pandemic. The stark difference for children in a war, however, is layer upon layer of additional trauma, uncertainty, fear and loss.\nTo this day, not all families have escaped from the cities under siege because trains and buses have slowed to a trickle in many parts of eastern and southern Ukraine. Bridges and roads in some places have been destroyed, so even travel by car &#8212; if you could find gas &#8212; is perilous.\nIrwin Redlener in a classroom with Ukrainian teenage refugees at a high school in Warsaw, Poland.\nFor those families that have made it to relative safety to western Ukraine or as refugees to Poland and other countries of the region, many challenges remain. It’s not just the children – but also their families and their teachers – that have felt the brunt of this brutal war in terms of prolonged psychological trauma. If you’re not familiar with this term, recall the concept of “shell shocked,” an affliction that plagued combat troops in WWII. But whatever you call it, many of Ukraine’s children have been through experiences that no child should ever need to endure.\nHow different is opening day of the new school year for the children of the Upper West? For our kids, it’s about the end of the summer break. A fresh start, hopefulness and a little anxiety for our children. You should know that this is precisely how it used to be for the children of Kherson or Donetsk. Recognizable, familiar &#8212; until the Russians stormed into Ukraine hoping for a quick and easy victory.\nAll that is left of classroom.\nSo why have we immersed ourselves personally in the catastrophe affecting Ukraine’s children? First, like many of our neighbors, we want to help children who have become the casualties of war and are now living with profound adversities.  Second, every principle of social justice for a vulnerable population is being violated. The meme that we’re all familiar with, of course, is “children are our future.&#8221; Sure. If only we behaved that way; but we don’t.\nThe fact is that kids who aren’t able to complete their education who experience persistent trauma have a good chance of living with persistent psychological consequences and unfulfilled promise (as Irwin wrote in Newsweek).\nUkraine’s children matter to us. They are in the midst of an unrelenting catastrophe, dragged into a war not of their choosing. Ukraine and the West will need all these kids to grow up educated and strong, ready to take on the enormous task of rebuilding the country that Vladimir Putin is trying to destroy. And that matters to us, too.\nKaren Redlener, back, far right, at a shelter in Lviv. These are children who have been evacuated with moms from eastern Ukraine war zones. Where are they going to school? Who knows&#8230;\nUpper West Siders Irwin and Karen Redlener are founders of the Ukraine Children&#8217;s Action Project (UCAP), which raises funds to help develop and implement programs supporting educational continuity and the psychological needs of Ukraine&#8217;s traumatized children who have become refugees or been displaced as a result of the war with Russia.\nPhotographs courtesy of UCAP.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/cubs-designate-luke-farrell-for-assignment.html",
        "description": "The Cubs have activated left-hander Wade Miley from the 60-day injured list, per reporter Mark Gonzales. Right-hander Luke Farrell was designated for assignment in a corresponding move. Additionally, Gonzales relays that catcher Willson Contreras has been placed on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to September 3. He&#8217;s been dealing with an ankle injury of late. Outfielder Michael Hermosillo has been reinstated from the 60-day injured list to take his place on the active roster, with right-hander Nicholas Padilla getting designated for assignment to open up a 40-man spot.\nFarrell, 31, is in his sixth MLB season, having pitched for the Royals, Reds, Rangers and Twins, in addition to the Cubbies. However, he&#8217;s logged just 98 2/3 innings over those six campaigns, with a 4.83 ERA, 23.3% strikeout rate, 11.4% walk rate and 31.8% ground ball rate. He signed a minor league deal with the Cubs this year, getting selected in August. He&#8217;s thrown 11 MLB innings on the season with a 4.09 ERA. In 59 Triple-A innings, he has a 5.03 ERA for the year.\nMiley, 35, will be looking for a strong finish to a frustrating season. Due to both elbow and shoulder issues, Miley has spent much of the season on the injured list and has made only four starts this year. That&#8217;s come on the heels of a tremendous 2021 season with the Reds that saw him throw 163 innings with a 3.37 ERA. The Reds could have kept him around via a $10MM club option but instead put him on waivers and saw the Cubs snatch him up. Chicago was surely hoping for Miley to act as a veteran stabilizer in a rotation experiencing much turnover as part of the club&#8217;s rebuild. Instead, he&#8217;s been absent for much of the year while trying to get healthy. He recently spoke to Maddie Lee of the Chicago Sun-Times about his intention to continue pitching. The Cubs are well out of postseason contention, but Miley will have the remaining four weeks of the regular season to showcase his arm before the offseason begins.\nContreras, 30, hasn&#8217;t played in a week due to this lingering ankle issue. The Cubs didn&#8217;t place him on the IL until now, likely hoping that a few days&#8217; rest would help it go away. However, that doesn&#8217;t seem to have happened, based on today&#8217;s move. Because it was backdated, Contreras could potentially return in a week if he heals up. Like Miley, Contreras is an impending free agent, which made him a clear trade candidate prior to the deadline. However, he ended up sticking with Chicago in one of the more shocking developments of early August. This ankle injury will be a snag on what has been the best season of his career. Contreras has hit 21 home runs and is slashing .246/.351/.471. The resulting 132 wRC+ and 3.1 fWAR are both career highs. Like Miley, he&#8217;ll be looking to get back on the field before the offseason kicks into gear. With Contreras out of action, Yan Gomes will likely get the bulk of the playing time behind the plate, with P.J. Higgins on hand as a backup.\nPadilla, 25, was selected to the big league roster for the first time just two weeks ago. He made just a single MLB appearance, having spent most of his time this year in the minors. He&#8217;s thrown 47 innings on the farm this year across three different levels, registering a 2.11 ERA with a strong 30.5% strikeout rate but a high 13.7% walk rate. Given his youth, years of control and full slate of options, he could hold appeal for a team looking for some bullpen depth. He and Farrell will each be placed on waivers in the coming days, since the trade deadline has already passed.",

The feature, called Halo Movement Health, generates an overall score from 0 to 100, identifies weak points in people&#x2019;s mobility, stability, and posture, and suggests simple exercises to improve them.Continue to STAT+ to read the full story&hellip;",

        "description": "Photo by Adam Hunger/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Miley’s been hurt most of the year, but will get a chance to make some September starts. The Cubs had high hopes for Wade Miley when they claimed his $10 million contract on waivers from the Reds last November. He had posted a 5.5 bWAR season for the Reds in 2021 and if he’d come anywhere close to that, the Cubs would have either a) come closer to contention or b) been able to trade him at the deadline.\nNone of that happened; Miley had a cornucopia of injuries this year and has made only four MLB starts for the Cubs, two of which were quite good. Overall: 2.84 ERA, 1.211 WHIP, and posting 0.5 bWAR in only 19 innings is pretty good.\nHe’s now been deemed healthy enough to make more MLB starts, so today the Cubs activated him from the injured list. He had been on the 60-day IL, so in order to make room on the 40-man roster the Cubs designated Luke Farrell for assignment.\nFarrell made four appearances (two starts) for the Cubs when they needed an extra body to fill in. Two of those outings were pretty good, the others not so much. Thanks to Luke for being there when the Cubs needed him; at age 31 he might very well be done playing in MLB, but could wind up playing some coaching or scouting role in the organization going forward.",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  There will not be any baseball in the Bronx on Tuesday. The weather forecast for the Bronx tonight is awful, and the Yankees did not see fit to waste anyone’s time by making them come to the ballpark and wait out a long delay. They were set to face the Twins with ace Gerrit Cole squaring off with rookie right-hander Joe Ryan, but instead, we’ll see them tomorrow as part of a single-admission doubleheader.\nEven with the twin bill ahead, manager Aaron Boone probably doesn’t feel that bad about the rainout, as the Yankees’ best arms in his bullpen were pretty taxed after the past three days of close games. They’ll also have a 29th man for the doubleheader, though Anthony Rizzo will be on the IL with Ronald Guzmán up in his place.\nFirst pitch for the matinee is scheduled for 3:05pm ET, and the Yankees will start their planned Wednesday pitcher, Domingo Germán, in the opener. Cole will take the nightcap, which will start at either at 7:05pm ET or 30 minutes after the conclusion of Game 1. If you had tickets for tonight’s game, they won’t be valid tomorrow; they will have to be exchanged under the Yankees’ rain check policy.\nFor more details on the rainout, you can review the Yankees’ official tweet of the news below. Enjoy your baseball-free evenings.\n\n\nTonight’s NYY-MIN game is postponed due to the forecast of sustained inclement weather &amp; will be made up tomorrow, Wednesday, September 7 as the first game of a single-admission doubleheader, beginning at 3:05 p.m. Only tickets dated Sept. 7, will be valid for the doubleheader. pic.twitter.com/DAWJFN0NpP— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 6, 2022",

        "description": "Maris sacrificed a lot while breaking the Babe’s record and could barely enjoy his incredible season. Yankees slugger Aaron Judge is on his way to making history. He has a little less than a month to hit eight home runs, at least: if he does that, he will become the franchise’s single-season home run king, breaking Roger Maris’ record and setting a new American League plateau in the process.\nJudge, who homered again on Monday in the New York’s win against the Minnesota Twins, has 54 for the season. He has already eclipsed his own career-high of 52, established in 2017, and is now aiming at making Yankees history.\nJudge is currently on pace to break the record, but it’s important not to get ahead of ourselves. It’s definitely not a given, like some boring paperwork that a person pushes to get something done. He will have to face elite men on the mound who also frequently pitch around him, as he’s virtually carrying the Yankees by himself. Furthermore, Judge will need to cope with the pressure from media and fans who are expecting him to hit 62 homers or more.\nIt’s much easier said than done. If we are going to talk about pressure, though, Maris knew all about it. Back in 1961 when he broke the 34-year-old of 60 home runs that belonged to the legendary Babe Ruth, society was quite different than it is today.\nMaris wasn’t built to deal with the media: he was an introverted man who grew up in North Dakota and just wanted to play baseball. The former set him apart from his teammate and friend, Mickey Mantle, a matinee idol and already a budding legend in his own right. “The Mick” was much more charismatic than his seemingly awkward teammate, and had the seal of approval from fans and most media members to go for the record himself.\nAt the time, people generally felt that a guy like Maris wasn’t worthy of holding the single-season home run record. They didn’t think he measured up to Ruth or Mantle’s standard, and he continually received hate mail and death threats. Maris was under so much stress that his hair began to fall out. His son, Kevin, recently discussed his father’s tiresome pursuit in with MLB.com’s Bill Ladson:\nThe pressure that dad had day-in and day-out — New York had a ton of papers back in the day ... Dad would sit there for hours pinned up in his locker, just giving answers to reporters. They would ask him the same questions day-in and day-out.\nSome interviews from back then have been preserved, like the one below with Maris and longtime Yankees announcer Mel Allen. It was difficult for him to talk about at the time, and it’s hard to miss the weariness in his voice.\n\nIn addition to all the pressure, the comments on the streets, and the incessant media attention, Maris had to endure people telling him that his record, if achieved, wouldn’t be fully valid if it was done in more than 154 games.\nIn 1961, the American League expanded its calendar to 162 games, and it took Maris the full slate to surpass Ruth on the season’s final day, October 1st. Commissioner Ford Frick said that any 162-game record should have an asterisk attached to it, and while it was never formally put into the record books, Maris’ achievement sparked a hotly-contested debate around baseball about the legitimacy of his feat.\n\nMaris’ incredible power performance earned him his second consecutive MVP award. The lefty hit .269 with the 61 round-trippers, 141 RBIs, 132 runs, 366 total bases and a .993 OPS.\nTo the contrary of what some people believe, Maris and Mantle were actually friends and shared an apartment in Queens during that iconic 1961 season. They were also roommates on the road and had a friendly rivalry while chasing Ruth’s record. Unfortunately, Mantle was hospitalized with an abscessed hip after a flu shot he had received late in the season, and got stuck in 54 dingers.\nRegardless of what the critics said about Maris’ record, it stood strong for 37 years. He had come through, and despite the adversity, he was in possession of one of the most revered records in professional sports.\nSadly, Maris did not have all that long to enjoy his time on the mountaintop. Cancer took him away from us in 1985, less than 25 years after his remarkable season. As the decades have gone by, we have learned to appreciate the dimensions of his accomplishments, achieved in very difficult circumstances.\nIn 1998, both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa comfortably eclipsed his 61 homers, as the former established the new record, with 70. Barry Bonds would smash it three years later, with 73. Although all those players have been tied to the use of PEDs, it’s hard to forget about McGwire’s touching tribute to Maris’ family in 1998.\nJudge won’t have to deal with such an extreme situation as he chases the record, but it will still be stressful and extremely difficult. Some even say that he will be the single-season home run king if he gets to 62 or more, because Bonds, McGwire and Sosa, the only men who have eclipsed Maris’ output, are connected to PEDs. That, of course, is a debate for another day. For now, we get to enjoy true greatness in the form of a home run chase. Will Judge deliver? As Ladson noted, Maris’ family wouldn’t be opposed to that.\nWe may be witnesses of one of the most impactful moments in MLB’s recent history if Judge keeps hitting homers at his current pace. If it happens, it will be a perfect time to remember one of greatest feats ever accomplished by a man in pinstripes — and all that it took to get there.\n  \n        \n      Photo by Pictorial Parade/Getty Images",

        "description": "Jeff Hanisch-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Carlos Rodriguez tosses six perfect innings for Wisconsin while Jackson Chourio keeps mashing Each week, I’ll be bringing you a roundup of the Brewers minor league affiliates, including score updates, key players and more. Here is the week 22 roundup.\nAAA Nashville\nThe Sounds went 5-1 against the Memphis Redbirds (64-64) to improve to 79-49 on the season, increasing their division lead to 4.5 games over Columbus (74-53).\nFirst baseman Jon Singleton led the way on offense for Nashville, slashing .364/.481/.818 with three homers and 10 RBIs. The catching pair of Pedro Severino and Mario Feliciano also had strong weeks, as Severino slashed .444/.524/.722 with a homer and two RBIs and Feliciano slashed .316/.381/.789 with three homers and 10 RBIs. As a team, the Sounds slashed .291/.396/.457 with eight homers and 36 runs scored.\nTyler Herb had an especially strong start, going eight innings and allowing just one run on seven hits with three strikeouts. Several relievers went multiple scoreless innings across the week as well, including Matt Hardy (1 ⅓ IP), Hobie Harris (2 IP), Trevor Kelley (2 IP) and J.C. Mejia (3 IP). As a staff, the Sounds pitched to a 4.33 ERA with 43 strikeouts across 54 innings.\nNashville now travels to Charlotte to take on the Knights (50-79) with a chance to add to their division lead. The Sounds are 9-3 against the Knights this season, so they’ll look to stay hot in their final matchup of the year.\nAA Biloxi\nThe Shuckers continue to struggle, losing five of six to the Rocket City Trash Pandas (34-23) and falling to 24-32 in the second half. Biloxi is now on the verge of being officially eliminated from playoff contention with just 12 games to go.\nInfielder Cam Devanney had a solid week offensively for Biloxi, slashing .333/.429/.708 with two homers and four RBIs, leading to a promotion on Tuesday to AAA Nashville. First baseman Wes Clarke also did the most with his 14 at-bats, slashing .286/.375/.500 with a homer and two RBIs. The Shuckers slashed just .210/.299/.328 with six homers and 18 runs scored in their poor week.\nTo make matters worse, the pitching staff for Biloxi didn’t fare much better. The only strong start of the week went to Brandon Knarr, who earned the sole win in a seven-inning performance, allowing two runs on five hits and two walks with nine strikeouts. The trio of relievers Luis Contreras, Arnaldo Hernandez and Zach Vennaro combined for 7 ⅔ innings over six appearances, giving up no runs and striking out 10. The Biloxi pitching staff finished with a 6.20 ERA and 58 strikeouts across 49 ⅓ innings.\nBiloxi now welcomes the Mississippi Braves to town for their penultimate series of the season. In four series this year, Biloxi is 14-10 against Mississippi (28-27), who sits in second place in the division.\nHigh-A Wisconsin\nThe Timber Rattlers went 4-2 against the Peoria Chiefs (25-35) to improve to 29-31 in the second half, but they’re officially eliminated from playoff contention with just one week remaining as the South Bend Cubs (37-23) are on the verge of clinching the division.\nCatcher Jeferson Quero had a strong week, slashing .455/.478/.818 with 10 hits, including a homer and six RBIs. Shortstop Ethan Murray slashed .357/.438/.571 himself while top prospect Jackson Chourio keeps hitting bombs, as he hit three more homers this week. The Rattlers slashed .218/.312/.393 with eight homers and 27 runs scored.\nStiven Cruz had two more strong starts, combining for seven scoreless innings and striking out eight. Carlos Rodriguez and Brady Schanuel both had scoreless starts of their own, as Rodriguez went six perfect innings and struck out nine en route to earning Midwest League Pitcher of the Week honors and Schanuel went four innings, allowing one unearned run and striking out three. Wisconsin’s pitching staff combined for a 2.94 ERA, striking out 53 across 52 innings.\nWisconsin will close out the season at home against the Beloit Sky Carp (31-29). The Rattlers are 6-8 against Beloit this season.\nA Carolina\nThe Mudcats went 3-3 against the Columbia Fireflies (33-26) to move to 33-27 in the second half, 5.5 games behind Fredericksburg (38-21) in the Carolina League North standings with just one week left.\nOutfielder Eduarqui Fernandez led the way again for Carolina, slashing .417/.529/.667 with a homer and four RBIs. Outfielder Hedbert Perez also had a strong week, slashing .412/.444/.706 with five doubles and a team-high six RBIs. The Mudcats slashed .228/.332/.363 with five homers and 30 runs scored.\nCameron Wagoner had a strong debut start, going four scoreless innings and striking out three. Pablo Garabitos went five innings across two relief appearances, striking out three and giving up no runs on two walks and a hit. The Carolina pitching staff finished the week with a poor 7.20 ERA, striking out 48 over 55 innings.\nThe Mudcats now close their regular season out with a road matchup against the Myrtle Beach Pelicans (28-32). In their lone series this season back in June, the Pelicans took four of six over Carolina.\nPerformances by Top 10 Brewers Prospects (Weekly Performance; Season Totals)\n\n(MLB No. 11) OF Jackson Chourio (High-A): .185/.241/.556 (27 at-bats), 3 HR, 7 RBI; .302/.356/.573 (361 at-bats), 20 HR, 69 RBI\n(MLB No. 49) OF Sal Frelick (AAA): .333/.448/.417 (24 at-bats), 0 HR, 4 RBI; .328/.404/.464 (412 at-bats), 7 HR, 44 RBI\n(MLB No. 89) OF Joey Wiemer (AAA): .167/.407/.167 (18 at-bats), 0 HR, 3 RBI; .247/.324/.455 (433 at-bats), 20 HR, 69 RBI\nSS Brice Turang (AAA): .389/.500/.389 (18 at-bats), 0 HR, 1 RBI; .292/.364/.417 (472 at-bats), 12 HR, 68 RBI\nOF Garrett Mitchell (MLB): .000/.091/.000 (10 at-bats), 0 HR, 1 RBI; .274/.365/.415 (270 at-bats), 6 HR, 39 RBI\n2B Tyler Black (High-A): On 7-day injured list (7/18); .281/.406/.424 (231 at-bats), 4 HR, 35 RBI\nC Jeferson Quero (High-A): .455/.478/.818 (22 at-bats), 1 HR, 6 RBI; ..280/.339/.423 (350 at-bats), 8 HR, 52 RBI\nOF Esteury Ruiz (MLB)*: .000/.077/.000 (12 at-bats), 0 HR, 0 RBI; .318/.432/.500(412 at-bats), 13 HR, 53 RBI\nRHP Jacob Misiorowski (A): ⅓ IP, 0 H, 1 R (1 ER), 4 BB, 0 SO (27.00 ERA); ⅓ IP, 0 H, 1 R (1 ER), 4 BB, 0 SO (27.00 ERA)\nSS Eric Brown Jr. (A): .278/.350/.333 (18 at-bats), 0 HR, 0 RBI; .247/.366/.468 (77 at-bats), 3 HR, 8 RBI\n\n*Esteury Ruiz was promoted to the MLB on 9/1; his weekly stats are combined from AAA and MLB",

        "description": "Unionized educators at Seattle Public Schools (SPS) on Tuesday voted to authorize a strike, which threatens to delay the start of the school year on Wednesday if a contract agreement is not reached.\n\n\n\nThe Seattle Education Association (SEA) announced on Tuesday afternoon that 95 percent of voters authorized the strike, with three-quarters of its roughly 6,000 members participating.\n\n\n\nUnion leaders said they are continuing to bargain with the school district throughout the day, but they may begin picketing on Wednesday morning if no agreement is reached.\n\n\n\nThe union is seeking a commitment to maintain certain staffing ratios for multilingual students and special education students, as the district works to integrate the latter group into general education classrooms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt is also seeking higher pay increases and policies to cap employees’ workloads.\n\n\n\nJennifer Matter, the union’s president, said students’ needs were “off the charts” last year, calling the school district’s existing proposals “unsustainable” and leading to burnout among teachers.\n\n\n\n“No one wants to strike — it’s not something that people just choose,” Matter said. “But SPS has given us no choice, because, again, we can’t go back to the way things have been. We need to fight for something better.”\n\n\n\nThe union’s contract expired at the end of last month, and the group has been negotiating with the school district since early June.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith no agreement in sight, school system officials on Sunday asked the union to accept a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that would allow the school year to start on time and commit the district to recommending any future salary increase in the new contract be applied retroactively to Sept. 1.\n\n\n\n“At this time, SEA has rejected the proposed MOU,” the district said earlier this week. “Starting school on Wednesday is what is best for our students. We understand this uncertainty about a delay is difficult and unsettling for our students, staff and families. We hope that SEA will reconsider this MOU and sign it before Tuesday.”\n\n\n\nThe district wrote on its website that it will update families and employees as soon as possible if the first day of school is delayed.\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the district for further comment.",

        "description": "A record heat wave is pushing California's electric grid up against the point of failure this week, with officials pointing to climate change for putting continued stress on the system.\n\n\n\nThe state issued an emergency alert for a seventh consecutive day on Tuesday, urging customers to conserve energy between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m.\n\n\n\n\"We have now entered the most intense phase of this heat wave,\" Elliot Mainzer, chief executive officer of California’s principal electric grid, California ISO, said in a briefing on Monday. \n\n\n\nAs temperatures in the state capital of Sacramento head toward 114 degrees, California ISO said Tuesday that demand could hit an all-time record of 51,000 megawatts by 5:30 p.m., as solar capacity begins to taper off with sunset while temperatures — and power demand for air conditioner use — remain high.\n\n\n\nOfficials said the grid was expected to be as much as 4,000 megawatts short of demand by late afternoon on Monday.\n\n\n\nTo make matters worse, the older natural gas plants that provide additional power when demand is at its highest are less reliable in extreme heat, The Associated Press reported.\n\n\n\n“We are on razor thin margins,” Siva Gunda, vice chairman of the California Energy Commission, told the Sacramento Bee.\n\n\n\nCalifornia is attempting to meet demand by spinning up emergency natural gas generators — enough to power 120,000 homes.\n\n\n\nBut those plants will provide just 120 megawatts — about 3 percent of the potential shortfall. That has the state calling on business and industry to cut power usage while asking households to raise thermostats and turn off large appliances in the evening.\n\n\n\nCitizen attempts to cut electricity usage over the weekend helped cut power by 1,000 megawatts — enough to supply 750,000 households, Mainzer said. \n\n\n\n“Your efforts have been making a real difference,” he said.\n\n\n\nBut with temperatures set to keep rising throughout the week, if consumers can’t close the gap by cutting demand, then “blackouts, rolling, rotating outages are a possibility,” Mainzer added.\n\n\n\nIn a rolling blackout, grid officials deal with power shortfalls by cycling outages among users. In California in August 2020, that meant outages ranging from 15 minutes to more than two hours.\n\n\n\n“We never want to get to that point, of course,” Mainzer said. “We want everyone to be prepared.\"\n\n\n\nThe state’s power crunch is one more sign of how climate change is straining the national grid and forcing even climate-forward states to depend even more on traditional energy sources. \n\n\n\n\"Climate change is causing unprecedented stress on California's energy system,\" Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said in a statement last week while signing a bill to extend the life of a controversial nuclear power plant.\n\n\n\nThe power issues also highlight the strain on infrastructure in general.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCalifornia avoided blackouts this week in part&nbsp;by postponing maintenance on power plants&nbsp;between noon and 10 p.m. on Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat is a strategy that only works for so long.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn Texas, which saw record demand this summer, grid officials avoided blackouts in large part by forestalling scheduled maintenance on power plants for months, a move that faced criticism.\n\n\n\n“Things are going to break. We have an aging fleet that’s being run harder than it’s ever been run,” Michele Richmond, executive director of Texas Competitive Power Advocates, told Bloomberg in July.",

That’s a substantial change in role so that person could potentially say it’s constructive dismissal,” Pelletier said.&nbsp;“Even if their salary hasn’t changed.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nPelletier explained that employers might choose to “quietly fire” someone as a way of saving on severance or avoid a lengthy performance improvement process that&nbsp;usually last at least 90 days. But while some poor managers might view the tactic as effective, it can be dangerous. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It opens employers to constructive dismissal lawsuits and, observed by other employees, can create a toxic environment and unwanted turnover,” she said. &nbsp;",

        "description": "Rep. Greg Stanton (D-Ariz.) called plans by California officials to use more than the state's full allocation of water from Lake Mead in 2022 “reckless and unacceptable” in a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Tuesday. \n\n\n\nIn the letter, Stanton expressed concerns that California is “failing to do its part” relative to other states in the Colorado River Basin. He noted that while the federal Bureau of Reclamation has said basin states must increase their water conservation by 2 million to 4 million acre-feet, the Golden State has declined proposals from Arizona and Nevada officials that would have saved a further 2 million acre-feet.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStanton went on to castigate California officials for increasing use of Colorado River water 41 percent in April compared to the same month in 2020 as well as for plans to use the state's entire 2022 allocation and make further withdrawals from Lake Mead beyond the allocation. \n\n\n\n“In a time of historic drought, this is reckless and unacceptable,” Stanton wrote. “Saving the Colorado River system requires such significant water reductions that the cuts necessary cannot possibly be borne by one or two states alone — it will take shared sacrifice among us all. It’s time for all states, including California, to do their part.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Colorado River serves New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, California, Nevada and parts of Mexico, with allocation based on a century-old agreement based on substantially higher levels than the current level. \n\n\n\nIn August, the federal government announced cuts to the yearly water allocations to Arizona and Nevada but no cut to California, the third state in the river’s lower basin. Under the terms of the cuts, the Bureau of Reclamation will withhold 21 percent of Arizona’s annual allocation and 8 percent of Nevada’s in 2023. \n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Newsom’s office for comment. &nbsp;",

        "description": "The Yankees were rained out today but will place first baseman Anthony Rizzo on the 10-day injured list prior to tomorrow&#8217;s doubleheader, per Lindsey Adler of The Athletic, relaying word from manager Aaron Boone. Fellow first baseman Ronald Guzmán will have his contract selected in a corresponding move. Marly Rivera of ESPN first noted that Guzmán was in the Yankee clubhouse. Guzmán is not currently on the 40-man roster, meaning a corresponding move of some kind will be required to open a spot for him there.\nThe 27-year-old Guzmán spent his entire career with the Rangers until this year. From 2018 to 2021, he got into 243 games, hitting 31 home runs in that time but striking out often and producing poor batting averages. He&#8217;s struck out in 28.8% of his career plate appearances thus far, well above this year&#8217;s 22.3% MLB average. His overall batting line is .227/.304/.414, production that was 16% below league average, as evidenced by his wRC+ of 84. He was outrighted by the Rangers at the end of last season and elected free agency.\nIn March, the Yanks brought Guzmán aboard on a minor league deal, sending him to the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders. In 90 games there this year, Guzmán is still striking out 27.6% of the time but he&#8217;s also walked in 11.8% of his plate appearances and added 12 long balls. In total, he&#8217;s slashing .260/.357/.466 for a wRC+ of 119. He&#8217;ll try to bring some of those improved results up to the majors, with his left-handed bat making a nice fit for the short porch in right field.\nThe reason the Yankees have opted to bring up Guzmán is due to the situation surrounding their regular first baseman Rizzo. Dealing with back problems for much of the season, he hasn&#8217;t played in a week after undergoing an epidural on Thursday. While it&#8217;s hoped that this will lead to greater relief for Rizzo in the long run, he&#8217;s dealing with some side effects in the short term. Yesterday, manager Aaron Boone told Andy Martino of SNY yesterday that Rizzo was dealing with some headaches after the epidural. In a video shared by SNY on Twitter, Boone says that the headaches are now keeping Rizzo from playing more than the back issue.\nRizzo is having a strong season overall but has slumped recently, with the creeping back injury possibly playing some role in that. Through the end of July, he was hitting .228/.348/.504 but has only hit .208/.299/.442 since the calendar flipped to August. Signed to a two-year, $32MM deal in the offseason, Rizzo can opt out of the final one year and $16MM this winter and return to free agency if he so wishes. With Rizzo out of action for the past week, DJ LeMahieu has seen most of the time at first.  However, LeMahieu needs some time off himself, with Adler relaying word from Boone that the infielder is dealing with a toe issue. The club will hope that Guzmán can step in and help make up for the absence of Rizzo and the banged-up LeMahieu. Leading the AL East by as much as 15 1/2 games earlier this year, the Yanks are now just 5 and 5 1/2 games ahead of the Rays and Blue Jays, respectively.\nShould Rizzo return to health in a few days, Guzmán can&#8217;t be easily sent back down to the minors as he is out of options. Since the trade deadline has passed, if the club wants to remove him from the active roster, they would have to designate him for assignment and then put him on waivers. However, if he plays well enough to hang onto his roster spot, he could be retained for future seasons via arbitration.",

        "description": "The Reds announced that they have reinstated outfielder Albert Almora Jr. from the injured list, with infielder Colin Moran getting designated for assignment in a corresponding move.\nMoran, 29, is in his seventh MLB season. He spent the 2018-2021 stretch with the Pirates, hitting .272/.330/.428 over the first three years of that time. That production was exactly league average, as evidenced by his 100 wRC+. He took a bit of a downturn last year, slashing just .258/.334/.390 for a wRC+ of 97. Moran was making $2.8MM last year and headed for a raise through arbitration, but the club decided to move on, designating him for assignment in November.\nHe ended up landing with the Reds on a $1MM deal but hasn&#8217;t fared much better this year. He&#8217;s hit .211/.305/.376 across 42 MLB games, getting optioned multiple times and outrighted in June. He was selected back to the 40-man roster just over a week ago when Mike Moustakas landed on the IL, but has lost his spot yet again.\nThe Reds recently promoted corner infield prospect Spencer Steer, whom they acquired in the Tyler Mahle trade a few weeks ago, likely playing a part in nudging Moran out of their plans. They can use the final weeks of the season to evaluate Steer and see if he fares well enough to secure himself a job on next year&#8217;s team.",

        "description": "Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The former Oakland first baseman is making his first trip back to the Bay Area following the offseason trade that brought him back to Atlanta.  The Braves are currently embarking on what figures to be a crucial West Coast road trip and it all starts tonight with the first game in a two-game series against the Oakland Athletics. \nThe obvious storyline for tonight’s game (outside of Atlanta’s relentless pursuit of first place in the National League East) is the return of Matt Olson to Oakland. We’re probably not going to see a ton of the pomp and circumstance that usually happens whenever a player returns to his old stomping grounds (or in the case of Oakland, The Stomping Ground) but also here’s hoping that Olson can do some big hitting in the Coliseum like he did for the handful of seasons that he played there. For what it’s worth, Olson racked up three hits and an RBI during the two-game series between these two clubs that took place in Cobb County back in June. \nOne of Olson’s hits back in June came against tonight’s starter for the A’s: Cole Irvin. Irvin has had a pretty good season this year but with that being said, he’s found himself in a bit of a rough patch recently. He’s given up at least five runs in three of his past four starts. The only exception was when he tossed seven shutout innings against the Marlins while striking out 11 and only giving up three hits. So Irvin does have the potential to be pretty good on his day. \nHe’s also not going to walk too many batters either — he’s currently in the 94th percentile of pitchers when it comes to walk rate (it’s currently sitting at a paltry 4.6 percent for the season) and he’s also doing that while getting batters to chase an inordinate amount of his pitches. With that being said, Irvin’s statistical profile doesn’t exactly cast an imposing figure and here’s hoping that the Braves don’t find themselves getting lulled into being docile at the plate against this guy tonight. \n  \n        \n      baseballsavant.com\n  \nMeanwhile, Oakland’s offense will be forced to deal with Kyle Wright on the mound tonight. August was a fantastic month for Kyle Wright, as he’s only given up three runs in his last four starts combined and he’s been great in each of those starts. He’s also been remarkably consistent — he’s only walked one or two batters in each start, he’s gone six or seven innings as well and he’s only given up one homer over that span. Wright has been stepping it up in terms of quality and he should have a pretty good shot at keeping the good times rolling against this Oakland lineup. \nThe A’s are coming into this game with a team wRC+ of 85, which is the third-worst number in all of baseball and the second-worst number in the American League. It also doesn’t help them tonight in particular that their road wRC+ (88) is higher than their home wRC+ (80), which is the lowest mark for a home team across baseball. While Sean Murphy has been establishing himself as one of the best-hitting catchers in Major League Baseball today, there’s not a lot else going on here. If Kyle Wright has a good night then this could come down to the Braves simply taking care of business with Cole Irvin pitching for Oakland. \nThe Braves once again find themselves within striking distance of reclaiming the lead in the NL East. While tonight’s game against the A’s may seem like a very good matchup on paper, they’ve still got to focus as if they’re taking on a very dangerous team. As the Nationals showed in New York over the weekend, these bottom-tier teams are still playing hard and they’re going to relish being potential spoilers in a pennant race for any team. As long as Kyle Wright and Atlanta’s lineup shows up ready to take on the task at hand, this should be a manageable game for the Braves as they make a rare appearance in Oakland tonight. \nGame Info\nGame Date/Time: Tuesday, September 6, 9:40 p.m. ET\nLocation: Oakland Coliseum, Oakland, California\nTV: Bally Sports South\nStreaming: MLB.tv\nRadio: 680 AM / 93.7 FM The Fan",

        "description": "Rogue One sets itself apart from other Star Wars films seconds after it starts. There is no opening crawl, no wall of yellow font drifting into a star field. The franchise logo doesn’t appear, and the John Williams fanfare doesn’t kick in. There is merely the title card informing viewers that it’s “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away”—and then bam: The action begins.A prequel taking place at the height of the Empire’s militaristic might, 2016’s Rogue One chronicles how the Death Star plans came to be possessed by the rebels. But beyond that connective tissue and the galactic setting, the film bears little resemblance to past tales about Jedis, Sith Lords, and Chosen Ones. It primarily follows an ensemble of new characters, none of them named Skywalker, Solo, or Palpatine. The Force is mentioned but not wielded. Rogue One aims, as the director Gareth Edwards put it, to portray “the reality of war” and thus features a tone that is darker and grittier than that of other Star Wars movies.Not that these differences mattered at the box office. Released with the subtitle A Star Wars Story, the film netted more than $1 billion worldwide, becoming the 20th highest-grossing film of all time during its initial run. Since being rereleased in theaters at the end of August, Rogue One has added another milestone to its sales tally, breaking into the top-10 list of IMAX earners—a promising sign for the upcoming Disney+ series Andor.[Read: 15 underseen TV shows that you should watch now]Star Wars, of course, is always good business. But the continued success of Rogue One doesn’t come only from its association with recognizable intellectual property. Nearly six years after its initial release, the film stands apart as a rare franchise-extending project that has actually justified its existence. Today’s pop culture is overwhelmed with cinematic-universe expansions, many of which feel like unnecessary trivia-delivery machines rather than original stories set in a well-known world. Rogue One, though, is a spin-off that doesn’t feel like a knockoff. Indeed, given how the latest trilogy of Star Wars films concluded, the movie can be seen as something of a minor miracle.Consider the way the film looks. Every prequel or sequel must straddle the line between being fresh and being familiar. Too many of these projects think that world-building simply means including fan-service cameos and references alongside a sprinkling of random new details. Although Rogue One winks quite a few times at those in the fandom who check Wookieepedia regularly (look, blue milk!), the film isn’t content to merely remind viewers that they’re watching a Star Wars movie. It strives to evoke the delight, awe, and thrill of discovery that this universe conjures at its best. The visual language of the original trilogy draws a stark contrast between the lived-in grubbiness of spaceship interiors and the wondrous, petrifying vastness of space. Rogue One does the same, devoting much of its screen time to establishing scale and texture. Yet it distinguishes itself too by toying with audience expectations: The film is devoid of George Lucas’s signature transition wipes. An X-wing raid happens at nighttime; a major battle ensues on a sunlit beach dotted with palm trees. Darth Vader’s massacre of rebel troops occurs in a cramped hallway. These shots dazzle for how they place classic components and characters in surprising contexts.The new characters, meanwhile, aren’t just new—they’re deeply ordinary, an unusual trait for Star Wars protagonists. Rogue One’s heroine, Jyn Erso (played by Felicity Jones), isn’t a princess; she begins the film as a disillusioned nobody, uninterested in leading or assisting anyone. Diego Luna’s Cassian Andor is a captain in the Rebel Alliance, but he makes clear that his story is not special: His remorse over what he’s done in the war echoes the feelings of countless other fighters. Even K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk), the Imperial droid reprogrammed to assist Cassian, is defined by profoundly human motivations, sacrificing himself for the greater good and, in doing so, becoming just another nameless casualty of war.[Read: Of course Rogue One is political]When the film was released, many critics saw these archetypal traits as a weakness, arguing that the new characters felt shallow next to the backstory-laden Skywalker types. But Jyn’s crew allows Rogue One to observe the world of Star Wars from an unexpected angle: the ground-level, midi-chlorian-free, lightsaber-less foot-soldier perspective, where decisions have to be made on morsels of intelligence and where, more often than not, one’s moral compass is the only reliable tool available. In the growing library of spin-offs, Rogue One’s quotidian ensemble feels refreshing: These characters are not royalty. They’re not related to anyone audiences have previously met. They’re not superpowered in any way. In fact, they have very little power at all.Of course, it’s impossible to discuss these characters without noting the way Rogue One ends: with all of them dead. The film concludes with a coda that underlines the hope their mission brought to the Rebel Alliance, but the finality of their stories hits hard. The film’s audience knows going in that the characters’ central mission will succeed, but Rogue One uses that to its advantage, enriching both the story it’s telling and the larger universe it’s serving. No other Star Wars film depicts so viscerally the brutality of actual war, and few franchises have dared to permanently kill off so many so quickly. In The Rise of Skywalker, the Sith Lord Palpatine returns “somehow.” Every character dusted in the Marvel Cinematic Universe makes it back just fine. Even the humans in Jurassic World aren’t getting eaten anymore. Rogue One’s deaths show the everyday toll of the conflict that exists in the backdrop of every Star Wars movie.Back in 2016, Rogue One was dogged by headlines about reshoots as well as hand-wringing over whether the Star Wars films should be considered “political.” Rewatching it recently, I barely remembered that the film had gone through any behind-the-scenes turmoil. It may be a Star Wars story, but Rogue One went, well, rogue—to the kind of results no franchise has come close to achieving since.",

        "description": "Photo by Andy Lyons/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Roster churn! I know this is ‘not how it works,’ but it’s how I’m going to present it real quick.\nColin Moran hit .184/.259/.204 in 58 PA to open the season in games played prior to his magical homestand against the Pittsburgh Pirates, his former club. He then proceeded to sock a pair of homers against said division foe in one glorious May 8th game, something that I’m sure resonated with the dozens of fans who still keep track of the Reds and Pirates at the moment. That hot streak continued for a couple of days afterwards, too, as he homered twice against the Milwaukee Brewers in GABP in the subsequent series.\nHe then hit .205/.327/.296 at the big league level with the Reds for the remainder of his tenure with the club, a tenure that officially came to an end on Tuesday afternoon when he was designated for assignment - a move that opened up a roster spot for Albert Almora, Jr., who is a player the Reds apparently still want around. The Reds announced the move themselves on Twitter earlier today.\n\n\nThe #Reds today activated from the 10-day injured list OF Albert Almora Jr. and designated for assignment IF Colin Moran. pic.twitter.com/7NuQDiEKPO— Cincinnati Reds (@Reds) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nSince I don’t want to make this sound entirely like I’m eviscerating just the Colin Moran Era of Cincinnati Reds baseball, it’s worth pointing out that Almora, Jr. has a sterling .493 OPS in 87 PA with the Reds since the start of July, and a .466 OPS with the Reds over his last 107 PA overall.\nIt’s with this in mind that I’ll present tonight’s Reds expectations without much additional comment, though it’s worth pointing out that the Reds and Chicago Cubs will begin this week’s series with 3rd place in the National League Central on the line. I cannot begin to fathom just how thankful the Milwaukee Brewers and St. Louis Cardinals are to have the Reds, Pirates, and Cubs in their division these days.\nWe’ll see Justin Dunn on the bump for the Reds opposite former Red Wade Miley, who was just activated off the IL today in time to face his former club. First pitch is set for 7:40 PM ET because of the Central Time Zone, so be sure to take up your issues with the ghost of Sir Sandford Fleming.\nReds Lineup\n\n\nBack in the Windy City.Powered by @PNCBank pic.twitter.com/Ta7b5LOj6r— Cincinnati Reds (@Reds) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nCubs Lineup\n\n\n\nHere is tonight's #Cubs starting lineup at Wrigley Field. pic.twitter.com/N3GkKgUIWO— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) September 6, 2022",

With the calendar shifting from August to September, gone are the dog days of summer and arriving are the last few bits of affiliated baseball in 2022. Both A-ball levels are completing their regular seasons this week. Accounting for that, transactions have been made to allow certain prospects to see more ABs, throw an inning or two more, squeezing in as much meaningful development as they can before the long offseason.  \n\nPromotions (8/29-9/4)\nPromoted to Jupiter: LHP Cade Gibson, LHP Cole Kirschsieper \nPromoted to Beloit: RHP Luabert Arias, OF Brady Allen, SS Harrison Spohn \nPromoted to Pensacola: RHP Brady Puckett, RHP Tyler Eckberg \nPromoted to Jacksonville: RHP Anthony Maldonado \nPromoted to Miami: RF Bryan De La Cruz, RHP Jeff Brigham  \nInjured List\n\nRHP Dylan Bice (Pensacola) placed on 7-day IL (8/30) \nOF Tanner Allen (Jupiter) activated from 7-day IL (8/30) \nOF Jorge Caballero (Jupiter) activated from 7-day IL (8/30) \nSS Cody Morissette (Beloit) placed on 7-day IL (9/2) \nRHP Tommy Eveld (Jacksonville) sent to Jupiter for rehab assignment (9/3) \nC Payton Henry (Jacksonville) activated from 7-day IL (9/3) \n\nTransaction Notes\nCade Gibson—A lefty picked in the 10th round of this past draft out of Louisiana Tech, Gibson has made 6 total pro appearances, including one start, between the FCL and Jupiter, totaling 11 1⁄3 innings pitched. In most appearances Gibson goes two innings and has been effective doing so, with a 0.79 ERA across the two levels. The Louisiana Tech product has shown an ability to generate swing-and-miss stuff, with 18 strikeouts, good for a stellar 14.6 K/9. Gibson alternated between starting and relieving in college, but it’s unclear yet what is expected of him in the pros.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarrison Spohn—Upon getting called up to Beloit, the undrafted Spohn has started remarkably strong. In his three games with the Sky Carp, Spohn has an OPS of 1.469. In a limited sample size Spohn has shown a very solid ability to manage the zone, drawing nine walks in 12 total games between the FCL Marlins and Beloit. Spohn’s first hit in Beloit was a home run, crushing a pitch out to left field.  \n\n\nLONG GONE SPOHN!

        "link": "https://arstechnica.com/?p=1878462",
        "description": "OceanGate Expeditions captured the very first 8K video footage of the world's most iconic shipwreck. \nTitanic is by far the most famous historical shipwreck, still holding an enduring fascination for the public 100 years after the \"unsinkable\" ship struck an iceberg and sank in April 1912. We've seen images and video footage of the wreck since it was discovered in the mid 1980s. That includes the footage shot by director James Cameron in 1995 for sequences featured in his blockbuster 1997 film—although much of the latter was actually miniature models and special effects filmed on a set, since Cameron couldn't get the high-quality footage he needed for a feature film.\nNow a private company called OceanGate Expeditions has released a one-minute video showcasing the first 8k video footage of the wreck of the Titanic, showing some of its features in new, vivid detail. One can make out the name of the anchor manufacturer (Noah Hingley &amp; Sons Ltd.) for instance, and the footage also gives us a better look at the bow, hull number one, the number-one cargo hold, solid bronze capstans, and one of the single-ended boilers. The video has already racked up nearly 3 million views on YouTube, even though the average TV or computer screen has much lower resolution than the 8K footage.\nThe footage was shot during the company's 2022 descent, with guests forking over $250,000 apiece for a seat on the submersible. \"No public entity is going to fund going back to the Titanic,\" OceanGate President Stockton Rush told The New York Times in defense of the steep price tag for what is essentially deep-sea tourism. \"There are other sites that are newer and probably of greater scientific value.\"Read 7 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/12th-gen-intel-core-i3-fast-as-core-i7-core-i5/",
        "description": "As 12th-gen Intel-powered Chromebooks have finally started trickling in during the second half of 2022, we&#8217;ve yet to get our hands on one that actually comes with the more entry-level internal configuration you&#8217;re more likely to see in stores. For this current generation of Chromebooks, that usually means a Core i3-1215U processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.  So far, our review and hands-on devices for the HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, Acer Chromebook Vero 514, and Acer Chromebook Spin 714 have all come equipped with Core i5 or Core i7 processors.\n\n\n\nRecently, however, ASUS has sent over the larger-than-average ASUS Chromebook Spin CX5601, the 16-inch behemoth surprisingly unveiled at CES 2022 back in January.  The model on sale at Best Buy is the same as we have currently in-hand, sporting the first 12th-gen Core i3 we&#8217;ve had in the office with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of NVMe storage.  I figured it would be fast.  I was shocked at the actual benchmarks.\n\n\n\nStunning speed\n\n\n\nFirst, I have to say that I ran benchmarks right away simply because this Chromebook felt so fast right out of the box.  Granted, many Chromebooks are fast these days: that&#8217;s no real surprise.  But my 120hz external monitor pushes devices a bit harder than normal, and right away I could feel the speed on display by the ASUS Flip CX5601.  I assumed the Octane and Speedometer 2.0 scores would come back strong, but I had no idea what was about to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are keeping score, you likely know that those scores rival (and sometimes beat) 12th-gen Core i5 scores run under the same, logged-out conditions.  When compared to the 12th-gen Core i7, we&#8217;re not far off, either.  Scores we saw on that processor beat out the Core i3 by only 1000-2000 points on Octane and stayed pretty similar with the Speedometer 2.0 benchmark.  There were a few times the Core i3 actually beat out the Core i7 in Speedometer, too.\n\n\n\nFor a Chromebook processor, the 12th-gen Core i3 strikes the perfect balance of cost control and absolute, raw processing power.  Where it falls short of the Core i5 and Core i7 is in the GPU category, so you need to remember that fact if you are purchasing a device to eventually play Steam games on or to use a heavier video editor like LumaFusion down the road.  The GPU on offer here is fine, but it won&#8217;t be nearly as powerful as the Iris Xe graphics included in the Core i5 and i7 variants.\n\n\n\nFor all other, more-standard Chromebook tasks, however, this 12th-gen Core i3 is an absolute monster.  Sure, benchmarks tell part of the story, but just in a few hours of use I can tell you for certain that this thing is crazy-fast.  It doesn&#8217;t simply feel comparable to its big brothers in the Core i5 and Core i7: it feels like it is on level ground with them.\n\n\n\nIf you&#8217;re looking at Chromebooks and heavy video editing or local Steam games don&#8217;t appeal to you, do yourself a favor and opt for the cheaper Core i3 version of any Chromebook you are looking at if it is an option.  You&#8217;ll lose nothing from a performance standpoint and save yourself some serious cash.  Ever since 8th-gen Intel chips arrived in Chromebooks, the Core i3 option has always been a solid option.  This time around, for 95% of potential users, they are a no-brainer.  And I&#8217;m a little blown away.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/chrome-performance-indicators",
        "description": "We have been discussing and following the development of a few Chrome and ChromeOS features to improve battery and performance. We have been documenting all that here based on the diligent work that u/Leopeva64-2 on Reddit has done. Just a couple of weeks ago, we reported on the introduction of&#xA0;a new &#8220;Performance&#8221; page,&#xA0;which will have toggles to turn on&#xA0;&#8220;High-Efficiency Mode&#8221; and &#8220;Battery Saver Mode.&#8221;&#xA0;\n\n\n\nAs stated then, &#8220;High-Efficiency mode,&#8221; or&#xA0;&#8220;Snooze tabs,&#8221; will&#xA0;discard tabs after they have been in the background for a specified time, while &#8220;Battery Saver mode&#8221;&#xA0;will throttle the frame rate to lower power consumption. At the time, we mentioned how there were no obvious toggles or a UI to control when either of these modes were turned on, except for navigating to the chrome://discards page.\n\n\n\nHowever, according to u/Leopeva64-2&#8217;s latest findings, both &#8220;Battery Saver&#8221; and &#8220;Snooze Tabs&#8221; have received visual indicators. Battery saver, for example, will have its own Chrome toolbar indicator when engaged, which will also serve as a toggle to turn it off and on.\n\n\n\nBattery Saver Mode indicator and toggleImage Source: u/Leopeva64-2\n\n\n&#8220;High efficiency mode,&#8221; which was the original name for &#8220;Snooze tabs,&#8221; which could yet again be renamed to &#8220;Memory Saver,&#8221; will also have an indicator. This indicator will be a &#8220;page action chip,&#8221; which will appear momentarily in the address bar when reloading a tab that has been previously &#8220;snoozed,&#8221; letting you know that the tab has been brought back. This same indicator will pop up an option to turn the feature off altogether.\n\n\n\nMemory Saver Mode indicatorImage Source: u/Leopeva64-2\n\n\nOf course, none of these features are available in the Stable channel yet and are instead only available through a flag in Canary. This means that both of them still have a ways to go before they are ready for prime time, particularly when we are talking about features that disable other features which are important to the Chrome user experience, such as smooth scrolling and being able to bring back tabs that the system sheds. We will continue to follow updates on this front and report them here as the features get fleshed out and ready for everyone to use safely.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Photo by Julio Aguilar/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Yankees’ injury woes continue, with Ronald Guzmán headed to the Bronx as the latest reinforcement. Well, the hits just keep on coming for the Yankees — at least when we’re talking about the injured list. While having a small army of pitchers on the IL had been a fact of life for a while, the bats are now catching up.\nThe latest blow came this afternoon with the news that first baseman Anthony Rizzo, who has sat out the last six games, is headed to the IL. The Yankees are able to backdate the placement, albeit only by three days. But three days is better than none, assuming that Rizzo is ready to return when the designation runs out next Tuesday. \n\n\nAnthony Rizzo will be going on the IL, Aaron Boone says. Ronald Guzman will be added to the active roster tomorrow.— Lindsey Adler (@lindseyadler) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Yankees are now officially without their last legitimate left-handed bat, with Rizzo joining Matt Carpenter and Andrew Benintendi on the IL, and with switch-hitters Oswaldo Cabrera and Aaron Hicks not producing much at the plate. With the former at least, there is perhaps hope for better things to come from the prospect. But New York’s beleaguered offense will be hard-pressed to replace Rizzo’s 30 home runs and 137 wRC+.\nPhysically replacing Rizzo on the Yankees roster? Ronald Guzmán, the 27-year-old left-handed hitting first baseman who has spent 2022 at Scranton Wilkes-Barre. For his career, Guzmán has hit 31 home runs in 737 at-bats with the Rangers, so there is some pop in the bat at the big league level. This season at Triple-A, he has put together an .823 OPS, with 33 extra-base hits, including 12 dingers. \nOur own John Griffin, perhaps a prophet, took a deep dive on Guzmán this morning, identifying this exact eventuality. Take heart, Yankees fans. As John discussed, Guzmán has been swinging a big stick in the second half down on the farm:\nStarting in July, he began to mash, posting a .367/.439/.612 triple slash with 2 homers and 6 doubles in just 15 games. In August and September, he has been even better: a .333/.413/.712 line with 6 home runs and 7 doubles in 20 games.\nMoreover, John points out that Guzmán has been a solid glove man at first, so at the very least, the Yankees are not conducting any 2021 Jay Bruce experiments at the position while Rizzo recovers. His article is definitely worth reading for more context on Guzmán.\nWe’re officially in “next man up” territory with Yankees dropping like flies, and there will need to be a 40-man roster move made to bring Guzmán aboard as well. Here’s hoping the new blood can keep the club afloat while we all wait for players to return from the IL rather than going on it.",

        "description": "Mark Haugen, the Democratic candidate for North Dakota’s only open House seat, has suspended his campaign, citing pressure from his own party to make way for independent candidate and former Miss America Cara Mund.\n\n\n\nHaugen issued a brief announcement of his campaign's suspension on Twitter on Sunday, but local outlets later reported that Haugen dropped out due to “the far left's concerns” over his pro-life position. \n\n\n\n“Over the past several days, I have received pressure from many Democratic-NPL Party leaders and other activists on the far left to step away, since Cara Mund has entered the race,” Haugen said in a statement quoted in The Bismarck Tribune. \n\n\n\n\"Knowing this, without the support from the Democratic-NPL party, I don’t see a viable path forward to winning this race,\" he added. \n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Haugen's campaign and the North Dakota Democratic-NPL&nbsp;for comment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe state’s Republican Party released a statement saying, “Dem-NPL is finally saying the quiet part out loud: Cara is a radial Democrat who is more in tune with their agenda.”  \n\n\n\nMund on Tuesday turned in the signatures needed to get her campaign on the November ballot, she confirmed to The Hill via email. \n\n\n\nShe turned in about 1,600 signatures more than the 1,000 required, now pending review from the secretary of state.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Mark’s decision to suspend his campaign could not have been easy. His willingness to step up for his party while also staying true to himself is something I admire greatly about him,\" Mund told The Hill in an email.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe 2022 graduate of Harvard Law School has pitted herself as “the only pro-choice candidate” in the race with incumbent Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.).  \n\n\n\nMund became critical of the Miss America organization toward the end of her 2018 reign and accused its leadership of bullying and silencing her, which then-Chairwoman Gretchen Carlson denied. Carlson, a former Fox News host, later resigned. ",

        "description": "E-cigarette company Juul on Tuesday tentatively agreed to pay $438.5 million to settle an investigation by 34 states and territories into the company's marketing and sales practices that were alleged to fuel the youth vaping crisis.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe investigation found the company deliberately engaged in an advertising campaign that appealed to youth with launch parties, advertisements using young and trendy-looking models, social media posts, and free samples.\n\n\n\nAccording to Connecticut Attorney General William Tong (D), who was one of the leaders of the investigation and negotiations, Juul also manipulated the chemical composition of its product to make the vapor less harsh on the throats of young and inexperienced users.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"JUUL’s cynically calculated advertising campaigns created a new generation of nicotine addicts. They relentlessly marketed vaping products to underage youth, manipulated their chemical composition to be palatable to inexperienced users, employed an inadequate age verification process, and misled consumers about the nicotine content and addictiveness of its products,\" Tong said in a statement.\n\n\n\nJuul was once the leading vaping product on the market and was the most popular brand used by teens. But Juul has fallen out of favor ever since it stopped selling its fruity flavors, after coming under pressure from lawmakers, advocates, and regulators at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  \n\n\n\nThe settlement would severely limit Juul's marketing and sales practices. It would prohibit Juul from marketing to youth and from funding education programs in schools. Nobody under the age of 35 would be depicted in any of the company's marketing materials, and the company would be prohibited from misrepresenting the level of nicotine in its products.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Juul said the settlement \"is a significant part of our ongoing commitment to resolve issues from the past. The terms of the agreement are aligned with our current business practices,\" which began with a companywide \"reset\" in 2019.\n\n\n\nJuul is currently embroiled in a fight with the FDA over whether it can continue to sell its products. The agency in June denied Juul's marketing authorization request, saying Juul did not prove that keeping its products on the market “would be appropriate for the protection of the public health.”\n\n\n\nA federal appeals court a day later temporarily blocked the ban, and the FDA eventually said it would allow the products to stay on the market pending additional review of “scientific issues.” \n\n\n\nElectronic cigarettes were first introduced on the market as a “healthier” alternative to traditional tobacco cigarettes, but they began to spread to young people, who were drawn in by sweet and fruit-flavored e-cigarette pods easily accessible in stores. Since 2014, e-cigarettes have been the most commonly used tobacco product among U.S. youth.",

        "description": "This month, our nation commemorates the signing of the U.S. Constitution that took place more than 200 years ago. Today’s media landscape is much more complex, yet our forefathers’ fundamental embrace of the free speech principles enshrined in the First Amendment has been an enduring constant.&nbsp;Founding Father Thomas Jefferson wrote, “Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost.” &nbsp;The role of America’s local television and radio stations in a nation that promises freedom of the press is the duty to discover the truth and to report the same. The more than 12,000 local radio and television stations in the United States play an essential role in their communities, providing trusted, unbiased local news and other critical information.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut billion-dollar tech companies are threatening the future of local journalism that is the very bedrock of our democracy. Without congressional action, your trusted local news may someday be nothing more than misinformation and clickbait.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThanks to advertising revenue, broadcasters provide a uniquely free over-the-air service to the public. However, the rapid, often anticompetitive expansion of the dominant Big Tech platforms has upended the advertising marketplace, posing a grave threat to the industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe rise of Big Tech has put broadcasters and other news publishers in an unprecedented position. Local news outlets must compete with multibillion-dollar companies that are siphoning broadcasters’ trusted content for their own profit. Attempts at negotiation with these tech giants over local news content often results in take-it-or-leave-it terms, which means most of the profit goes to Big Tech, if not all of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt feels like an impossible situation for local news outlets that must remain active on these platforms for the benefit of their audiences, yet are unable to fairly negotiate the terms of access with behemoth Big Tech companies. Left unchecked, Americans will lose access to the most trusted local news as broadcasters and newspapers face an uncertain and daunting future.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a world where Big Tech reigns, Americans could face the accelerated disappearance of their once-daily local paper. Already more than 40 percent of the largest 100 newspapers are delivering less than seven&nbsp;times per week.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the public’s faith in social media and polarizing cable news shows dwindles, dependence on local broadcasting grows stronger. Americans turn to local radio and TV stations for “just the facts” news, real journalism and robust civic debate that allows engagement from both sides. But this all goes away unless Congress levels the playing field with Big Tech.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA bipartisan group of lawmakers thankfully recognizes that the status quo is unsustainable, which is why local news producers are applauding the Senate Judiciary Committee’s willingness to act on the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act (JCPA). This is not a government handout, nor would it create a new regulatory regime. It would simply create a framework for news publishers to negotiate on equal terms with the Big Tech behemoths in the marketplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis bill has bipartisan sponsors and support in both chambers of Congress. Reps. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and Ken Buck (R-Colo.) and Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Kennedy (R-La.) are courageous leaders in advocating for a level playing field in how local news content is accessed and monetized on Big Tech’s platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPreserving quality, trusted journalism in communities is essential to our democracy and will require policies that ensure broadcasters and other news publishers are fairly and justly compensated for their valuable content and investigative reporting.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPassage of this legislation is vital to broadcasters’ mission to create an informed citizenry, ensuring the fundamental truths espoused by our nation’s founders will endure.

        "description": "Mitch Ransdell/South Side Sox\n    \n\n\n  Make peace? Not Cease. The Chisox ace leads his reborn team in a charge through the fields of the Central Division   Last weekend, the Mustachioed Menace of Milton mowed down the Minnesota Twins like Little League dandelions. \nIn a prudent and economical start, Dylan Cease cruised through 8 2⁄3 innings, throwing just more than 100 pitches and arriving just one out shy of a no-hitter, which was spoiled by a single from Twins first baseman Luis Arráez. \nTo come within spitting distance of that feat and finish just short of it might derail a season for some pitchers, spiraling them into a mental maelstrom. An ego-prone hurler might focus on their failure to complete the achievement. But Cease, stone-faced and calm, has proven time and again in his career he is unaffected by the frippery, focusing on the deadpan positives. \nSnubbed for the All-Star game? Not important. Robbed of a no-hitter? The Sox won with a blowout 13 runs, more than they’ve scored in a single game since July 3. \nThe White Sox, seemingly reborn and rejuvenated in the absence of wet-blanket skipper Tony La Russa, are showing the flashes and sparks of greatness that fans have been burning to see since the end of last season. \nDo we have substitute manager Miguel Cairo to thank for this turnaround? To a degree. But the winds of change are kicking up a blaze, and Sox fans are reveling in it. These fiery hometown crowds affect the players more than they probably realize. This same team was booed out of a half-empty ballpark two weeks ago. During Cease’s start last weekend? A crowd of 30,000 cheered them on — and immediately chanted Dylan’s name when he fell just two strikes short of a no-no. \nIt’s not that the fanbase is fickle. They just know good baseball from bad baseball. \nDylan Cease has been healthy and consistent, two things that have largely been absent on Chicago’s South Side. Just as he has all season long, Cease continues to thrive. \nHe’s the right man to lead this team to a strong finish.\n\n2022 South Side Sox Players of the Week\nTim Anderson (April 8-17)Tanner Banks (April 18-23)Lucas Giolito (April 24-May 1)Dylan Cease (May 2-8)Michael Kopech (May 9-14)Davis Martin (May 15-21)Jake Burger (May 22-29)Andrew Vaughn (May 30-June 5)Jake Burger (June 6-12)Johnny Cueto (June 13-18)Andrew Vaughn (June 19-25)Dylan Cease (June 26-July 2)Lucas Giolito (July 3-9)Dylan Cease (July 10-17) (no art/essay)AJ Pollock (July 22-30)Eloy Jiménez (July 31-August 6)Michael Kopech (August 7-13)Johnny Cueto (August 14-20)Gavin Sheets (August 21-27)Dylan Cease (August 28-September 3)\n\nMVP Standings\nDylan Cease (143.4)Johnny Cueto (92.5)Michael Kopech (71.1)Andrew Vaughn (59.9)Luis Robert (25.9)Tanner Banks (23.3)Eloy Jiménez (22.1)Lance Lynn (21.5)Jake Burger (19.4)José Abreu (18.9)\nCold Cat Standings\nTony La Russa (-88.7)Leury García (-65.9)Yasmani Grandal (-44.9)Josh Harrison (-44.9)Joe Kelly (-43.2)Kendall Graveman (-38.3)Yoán Moncada (-36.0)Liam Hendriks (-35.6)Tim Anderson (-23.8)Rick Hahn (-21.2)\nDylan Cease is essentially uncatchable at this point. Also, Lance Lynn leapfrogged Lucas Giolito on the MVP list and knocked him completely off of it.\n\nWriter Standings\n  \n        \n  \nChrystal O’Keefe crosses the vaunted 50-win mark!

This is at a time when the United States has been classified as a “backsliding democracy”&nbsp; that has “fallen victim to authoritarian tendencies.”\n\n\n\n“Americans expect and deserve legislation to strengthen and protect our democracy so that our nation can live up to its ideals – especially in the wake of January 6th,” said Common Cause president Karen Hobert Flynn upon the release of her organization’s biennial Democracy Scorecard.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPennsylvania First Congressional District Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick goes to great lengths to maintain his campaign facade of being a “moderate” and a bipartisan “problem solver.” But when faced with the problem of our unraveling democracy, the Republican lawmaker placed “fealty to former-President Trump” over the health of our democracy, as his voting record on pro-democracy bills and resolutions in the 117th Congress illustrates. \n\n\n\n\n#PA01 @RepBrianFitz Wants to Change US Constitution &amp; Radically Transform the Country | Editor @cmychalejko reports @BucksGOP lawmaker calls for Constitutional Convention–a dangerous pet project of extremist @GOP that would throw the country into turmoil. https://t.co/La6I98RMsX&mdash; BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) August 21, 2022\n\n\n\n\n“At the very start of the 117th Congress, Members were besieged in the U.S. Capitol by a violent, armed, insurrectionist mob intent on overturning the 2020 presidential election,” added Hobert Flynn. “Members of Congress were then faced with a series of choices in the months following to take steps that would strengthen democracy. Too many Members chose fealty to former-President Trump over the oath of office they swore to protect the nation.”\n\n\n\nBelow is Fitzpatrick’s record on Common Cause’s nonpartisan 2022 Democracy Scorecard:\n\n\n\nBILLS AND RESOLUTIONS WITH VOTES\n\n\n\nH.Res. 24, Impeachment of Donald John Trump &#8211; NO\n\n\n\nH.R. 1, For the People Act &#8211; NO\n\n\n\nH.R. 51, Washington, DC Statehood &#8211; NO\n\n\n\nH.R. 3233, Independent commission to investigate January 6th insurrection &#8211; Yes\n\n\n\nH.R. 2662, IG Independence and Empowerment Act &#8211; Yes\n\n\n\nH.Res. 503, Resolution creating January 6th Select Committee &#8211; NO\n\n\n\nH.R. 4, John R.

        "description": "The Orioles announced that infielder Jonathan Araúz was reinstated from the restricted list and designated for assignment.\nAraúz, 24, made his MLB debut with the Red Sox in 2020 and was with them until June of this year, when he went to the division-rival Orioles on a waiver claim. In his big league career, he&#8217;s gotten into 68 games and hit .200/.269/.314. He&#8217;s played 35 games in the minor leagues this year between the two organizations, hitting .192/.264/.238 in that time.\nYesterday, the O&#8217;s placed Araúz on the restricted list when they claimed reliever Jake Reed off waivers. A reason was not provided for his absence, but the club has now cut him from the roster altogether. Since the trade deadline has passed, the Orioles will have no choice but to place him on outright waivers or release waivers in the coming days.\nHe&#8217;s never been much of a threat with the bat but at least has enough defensive versatility to have played the three non-first-base positions on the infield. He&#8217;s in his second option year, meaning any team interested in Araúz could keep him in the minors for the remainder of this season and another campaign.",

He kept a tough Padres’ offense entirely in check, throwing seven scoreless inning to pick up a thoroughly well-deserved win. Stone Garrett homered and Christian Walker drove in a pair of runs, as Arizona improved to 9-2 over their last 11 games, and got a good jump on their attempt to win a fourth consecutive series.”\n[Jack Sommers | Inside the Diamondbacks] Ryne Nelson dominates Padres in MLB Debut\n“With 77 family, friends, and coaches in attendance, Henderson, Nevada native Ryne Nelson made his major league debut in dominating fashion, shutting out the San Diego Padres for 7 innings. The rookie right hander allowed a leadoff double to Jurickson Profar in the first inning, and then retired 17 straight batters. The Diamondbacks offense gave him the necessary run support in a 5-0 victory.”\n[Steve Gilbert | dbacks.com] Calm as can be, Nelson debuts with zeros\n“Nelson was as cool as the other side of the pillow. If you didn’t know going in that he was making his debut, you would not have known it by how he carried himself on the mound. He was poised and in control in throwing seven shutout innings in a 5-0 win over the Padres at Petco Park.”\n[Alex Weiner | Arizona Sports] D-backs RHP Ryne Nelson shuts out Padres through 7 in MLB Debut\n“Ryne Nelson tossed seven scoreless frames for the Diamondbacks in his MLB debut against the San Diego Padres Monday afternoon, a 5-0 win for Arizona.”\nDiamondbacks News\n[Inside the Diamondbacks] Can the Diamondbacks finish .500 in 2022?\nRead the article and discuss in the comments? Here’s a poll for you.\n\n\nCan the 65-69  Diamondbacks Finish .500 in 2022 ? Check out this article and then come back and vote https://t.co/SmHmjTzwB3— Jack Sommers (@shoewizard59) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\n[Jack Sommers | Inside the Diamondbacks] How Daulton Varsho Became a Gold Glove Contender\nStatcast says the #DaultonGloveShow is must watch TV. \n“Another important metric is also from Statcast called Outs Above Average, or OAA. From OAA, a Runs Prevented number is calculated. Varsho’s +13 OAA and +11 Runs Prevented leads all MLB outfielders. That is for all innings, at all outfield positions played. When isolated to just Right Field innings, his OAA and Runs Prevented are still first in the NL, well ahead of Mookie Betts, despite fewer innings played.” \n[Arizona Sports] D-backs’ Zac Gallen earns NL Player of the Week amid scoreless streak\nShutting down two NL Wild Card hopefuls last week, Gallen easily wins player of the Week. In both starts Gallen went 7 innings, allowed 2 hits, 1 walk, and struck out 7, pushing his scoreless streak from 27 1⁄3 to 41 1⁄3 IP. History comes Sunday afternoon.\n[Dan Szymborski | Fangraphs] Zac Gallen Continues to Chase History\n“The Arizona Diamondbacks don’t generate a lot of national headlines these days, but the team’s ace, Zac Gallen, is trying his best to change that. Since a Luke Maile double knocked him out of a game against the Guardians on August 2, Gallen has racked up six consecutive scoreless games, covering 41 1/3 innings. Gallen’s run has gone on long enough to have historical significance: He currently ranks 17th in baseball history, at least the history during which usable game logs exist (since around the start of the 20th century). He’s two outs from catching Brandon Webb’s 2007 streak to set a new Diamondbacks franchise record, and another 3 2/3 innings will slot him into the top 10, tying his with the streaks of Cy Young, Sal Maglie, and Doc White.”",

        "description": "Is the coronavirus on its way out?You might think so. New, updated booster shots are being rolled out to better protect against the variants circulating now. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped COVID-19 quarantine and distancing recommendations. And more people have thrown off their masks and returned to pre-pandemic activities.But scientists say no. They predict the scourge that’s already lasted longer than the 1918 flu pandemic will linger far into the future.One reason it&#x27;s lasted this long? It&#x27;s gotten better and better at getting around immunity from vaccination and past infection. Scientists point to emerging research that suggests the latest omicron variant gaining ground in the U.S. — BA.4.6, which was responsible for around 8% of new U.S. infections last week — appears to be even better at evading the immune system than the dominant BA.5.Scientists worry the virus may well keep evolving in worrisome ways.How long will it be around?White House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said COVID-19 will likely be with us for the rest of our lives.Experts expect COVID-19 will someday become endemic, meaning it occurs regularly in certain areas according to established patterns. But they don’t think that will be very soon.Still, living with COVID &quot;should not necessarily be a scary or bad concept,” since people are getting better at fighting it, Jha said during a recent question-and-answer session with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. &quot;Obviously if we take our foot off the gas — if we stop updating our vaccines, we stop getting new treatments — then we could slip backwards.”Experts say COVID will keep causing serious illness in some people. The COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub made some pandemic projections spanning August 2022 to May 2023, assuming the new tweaked boosters adding protection for the newest omicron relatives would be available and a booster campaign would take place in fall and winter. In the most pessimistic scenario — a new variant and late boosters — they projected 1.3 million hospitalizations and 181,000 deaths during that period. In the most optimistic scenario — no new variant and early boosters — they projected a little more than half the number of hospitalizations and 111,000 deaths.Eric Topol, head of Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the world is likely to keep seeing repetitive surges until “we do the things we have to do,” such as developing next generation vaccines and rolling them out equitably.Topol said the virus “just has too many ways to work around our current strategies, and it’ll just keep finding people, finding them again, and self-perpetuating.&quot;How will the virus mutate?Scientists expect more genetic changes that affect parts of the spike protein studding the surface of the virus, letting it attach to human cells.“Every time we think we’ve seen the peak transmission, peak immune escape properties, the virus exceeds that by another significant notch,” Topol said.But the virus probably won&#x27;t keep getting more transmissible forever.“I think there is a limit,” said Matthew Binnicker, director of clinical virology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “What we’re really dealing with, though, is there’s still a lot of people across the world who don’t have any prior immunity — either they haven’t been infected or they haven&#x27;t had access to vaccination.&quot;If humanity&#x27;s baseline level of immunity rises significantly, he said, the rate of infections, and with that emergence of more contagious variants, should slow down.But there is a chance the virus could mutate in a way that causes more severe illness.“There’s not any inherent reason, biologically, that the virus has to become milder over time,” said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist. The fact it may seem milder now “is likely just the combined effect of all of us having some immune history with the virus.”While scientists hope that continues, they also point out that immunity gradually wanes.Will the next variant be another version of omicron?Omicron has been around since late last year, with a series of super transmissible versions quickly displacing one another, and Binnicker believes “that will continue at least for the next few months.”But down the road, he said it&#x27;s likely a new variant distinct from omicron will pop up.The recent wave of infections and re-infections, he said, “gives the virus more chances to spread and mutate and new variants to emerge.”Can people influence the future of the virus?Yes, experts said. One way is to get vaccinated and boosted.“We have a virus out there that’s still circulating, still killing hundreds of Americans every day,” Jha said in a press briefing Tuesday. But, he added: “We now have all of the capability to prevent, I believe, essentially all of those deaths. If people stay up to date on their vaccines, if people get treated if they have a breakthrough infection, we can make deaths from this virus vanishingly rare.”Not only does vaccination protect against severe disease and death, it raises the level of immunity globally.CDC director Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday that up to 100,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations and 9,000 deaths could be prevented if Americans get the updated booster at the same rate they typically get an annual flu shot this fall. About half of Americans are typically vaccinated against the flu each year.People can also keep protecting themselves by taking other precautions like, for example, wearing masks indoors when COVID rates are high.Longtime nurse Catherine Mirabile said it&#x27;s important not to dismiss the dangers of the coronavirus – which sickened her twice, nearly killed her husband and left them both with long COVID. Daily deaths still average around 450 in the U.S.“People really need to look at this and still take this seriously,” said the 62-year-old from Princeton, West Virginia, who is now on disability. “They could end up in the same shape we’re in.”",

        "description": "Students in Uvalde went back to school Tuesday for the first time since a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers in a classroom attack that shocked the country and helped fuel passage of a landmark national law on gun violence.Children began arriving at Uvalde Elementary before dawn, walking through newly installed 8-foot (2.4-meter) metal fencing that surrounds the campus and past a state trooper standing guard outside an entrance.Colorful flags hung inside the hallways, and teachers wore turquoise shirts that read “Together We Rise &amp; Together We Are Better” on the back. State troopers were parked on every corner outside the school.The district announced in late June that the scene of the assault, Robb Elementary, would be permanently closed and eventually torn down, though a timeline has not been set. Fundraising is underway for the construction of a new elementary campus.Ashley Morales planned to put her son, Jeremiah, back in class because she has no other choice as a working single mother. She said she would drop him off outside Uvalde Elementary because parents were not allowed inside.“I&#x27;m just nervous, scared,&quot; said Morales, whose son was a third grader last year at Robb Elementary and lost three friends in the May 24 massacre. During a recent “Meet the Teacher&quot; night, she felt a rush of anxiety walking down the school hall.“Oh my gosh, it&#x27;s actually going to happen,&quot; she said. “School is going to start.&quot;Teachers hugged students climbing out of cars in the drop-off line and guided them toward a line of teachers who were waiting behind the fence.“Good morning, sunshine!&quot; one teacher could be heard saying. &quot;You ready to have a good school year?”Celeste Ibarra, 30, had a knot in her stomach as she got her 9- and 8-year-old children ready and kissed them goodbye. She used to believe students their age should not have cellphones, but after a summer of active-shooter drills she changed her mind.“I was scared, just scared I won&#x27;t get them back,” Ibarra said, standing in her front yard across the street from Uvalde Elementary.School started weeks ago in many parts of Texas, but district officials pushed back the first day of class in Uvalde after a summer of heartache, anger and revelations of widespread failures by law enforcement officers who allowed an 18-year-old gunman to fire inside adjoining fourth grade classrooms for more than 70 minutes.Uvalde school officials said several enhanced security measures are still incomplete, including the installation of additional cameras and new locks.The Texas Department of Public Safety has committed to putting nearly three dozen state troopers on Uvalde campuses. But that was of no comfort to some families since more than 90 state troopers were present during the attack.For 10-year-old Gilbert Mata, who was wounded by a ricocheting bullet during the shooting, the sight of many police is a “trigger,” said his mother, Corina Camacho. He&#x27;s also frightened by the smell of things burning — a reminder of the acrid odor of gun smoke.Mata was nervous but wanted to go back to class Tuesday. His stepfather, however, cannot shake the dread of what would happen if there were another shooting.“Nothing is going to make me feel better,” said Michael Martinez. “Are the police officers going to shoot this time? Are they going to help or what? But nobody really knows. That&#x27;s why we said we&#x27;re going to take it day by day. Let them prove it to us that something has changed.”More than 100 families in Uvalde signed up for virtual school, while others pulled their kids out of the district and enrolled them in private schools. One teacher who was shot in the abdomen and survived, Elsa Avila, is still recovering.Just a few nights before the new school year was to begin, the Uvalde High School football team delivered a dramatic victory to the wounded community of about 15,000 people. More than 5,000 fans jammed into Honey Bowl Stadium to watch Uvalde prevail over C.C. Winn, a high school in nearby Eagle Pass, with Devon Franklin’s one-handed catch in the end zone with 12 seconds remaining.A damning report by a Texas House committee found that nearly 400 officers in all rushed to Robb Elementary after the shooting but hesitated for more than hour to confront the shooter. Body camera and surveillance footage showed heavily armed officers, some holding bulletproof shields, stacked in the hallway but not advancing to the classroom.Steve McCraw, head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, called the response “an abject failure.&quot;Last month, the Uvalde school board fired district police Chief Pete Arredondo, who McCraw and the House report accused of failing to take control of the scene and wasting time by looking for a key for a classroom door that was likely unlocked.The firing has not quieted demands for others to face punishment. One other officer — Uvalde Lt. Mariano Pargas, the acting police chief that day — has been placed on administrative leave.The shooting put new political pressure on Washington to act. The result was first major bipartisan law on gun violence in decades.The measure signed by President Joe Biden in June included tougher background checks for the youngest gun buyers and help for states to put in place “red flag” laws that make it easier for authorities to take weapons from people adjudged dangerous.Also tucked into the bill was a proposal that will make it more difficult for convicted domestic abusers to obtain firearms even when the abuser is not married to or doesn’t have a child with the victim.",

        "description": "The exterior of the White House is seen from outside the security fencing on March 7, 2021, in Washington, D.C.Sarah Silbiger/Getty ImagesAs president, now-former President Donald Trump once teased that &quot;president for life&quot; sounds pretty &quot;great.&quot;&quot;Maybe we&#x27;ll have to give that a shot some day,&quot; Trump told donors in 2018 about China&#x27;s President Xi Jinping.When he was still allowed on Twitter, Trump retweeted a video manipulating a magazine cover showing him as president in 2024 through the year 90,000, or &quot;4eva&quot; as one of the yard signs in the video reads.Whether Trump was serious or not, who knows? But if he does run in 2024, as he&#x27;s been heavily suggesting he will, and wins reelection, he can only serve four more years in the White House. That&#x27;s because of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution. It reads (bolding for emphasis is NPR&#x27;s):&quot;No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.&quot;The amendment says nothing about non-consecutive terms, simply that no one can be elected &quot;more than twice.&quot; It allows for holding office a maximum of 10 years, but only if someone assumed office without being elected and served as president for less than two years.Lyndon Johnson served less than two years — 14 months — after John F. Kennedy was assassinated before taking office after winning election himself in 1964. Johnson, who ultimately did not run in 1968, could have served four more years if he had and won, for a total of a little over nine years in office.The fact that Trump can only serve four more years is something that could become a political argument — publicly and privately — from Republicans building a case against backing the former president. Former President Donald Trump tosses hats into the crowd before addressing attendees during the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit on July 23, 2022, in Tampa, Fla.Phelan M. Ebenhack/APWhy go with Trump, their argument might go, when he can only serve four more years and you could vote for someone else who could give you eight? What&#x27;s more, electing Trump in 2024 would mean an &quot;open&quot; presidential election campaign four years later, putting conservatives at a disadvantage without an incumbent president able to run for reelection.Trump&#x27;s former attorney general, Bill Barr, who has since broken with Trump over his election lies, made a resemblant argument. Republicans, he told CBS News, could &quot;really achieve a decisive victory with the right candidate, but I don&#x27;t think Trump is that candidate. The day he&#x27;s elected he&#x27;ll be a 78-year-old lame duck who is obviously bent on revenge more than anything else.&quot;The history of the 22nd Amendment — and frequent calls for getting rid of it — has been long and sordid. Let&#x27;s go back to the beginning.How the 22nd amendment came aboutThe framers of the Constitution hotly debated how — or whether — to set term limits on a president. Most framers actually didn&#x27;t want them, in part, because they wanted the country to have flexibility during an emergency.There were some 200 attempts, in one way or another, in the years following the Constitutional Convention, to pass legislation setting a limit on a president to no avail — until the mid-20th century, following the 1945 death of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who eschewed the tradition and was elected four times.The 22nd Amendment was finally ratified in 1951, making permanent something that had become a convention when George Washington decided not to serve more than two terms. But since the 1980s, there have been multiple efforts to repeal it, and presidents have wondered out loud what it would be like if they could run for a third term, confident they would win again. One even spoke out against the 22nd Amendment. (More on all that below.)Limiting a president to two terms became a controversial national subject in the late 19th century after Ulysses S. Grant was reelected in 1872, according to The Twenty Second Amendment: A Practical Remedy or Partisan Maneuver, a paper written in 1990 by Stephen W. Stathis, a former longtime specialist in American history at the Congressional Research Service.Powerful Grant allies began pushing the idea of a third term, and it became an issue in the 1874 midterms. Grant didn&#x27;t comment on his intentions, which — combined with a lagging economy, white resistance to Reconstruction in the South and ethics scandals — led to Republicans losing a whopping 94 seats that year. It is considered to be the first midterm wave election.The political winds appeared against a Grant third term, and shortly after the midterm drubbing, he said he &quot;would not accept a nomination if it were tendered, unless it should come under such circumstances as to make it an imperative duty — circumstances not likely to arise.&quot;In 1875, the House passed a resolution endorsing the two-term convention, saying departing from that would be &quot;unwise, unpatriotic, and fraught with peril to our free institutions.&quot; But that didn&#x27;t have the teeth of an amendment or legally bar a president from doing so if they chose to. In fact, in 1880, Grant would try again — and came pretty close. He led after 35 ballots at the 1880 Republican nominating convention that year. On the 36th, those opposed to him joined forces and handed the nomination to James Garfield instead.Ironically, Republicans wound up leading the effort to enact the 22nd Amendment, beginning in 1946 when they regained the House. It was largely as a response to the unprecedented four terms won by FDR, who served during the Great Depression and World War II, from 1933 until 1945. FDR broke the two-term norm, his supporters argued, because of the need for consistent leadership through World War II. But setting a term limit on the presidency became one of Republicans&#x27; first priorities after his death. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt speaks on a platform during his fourth presidential inauguration in 1944.Keystone Features/Getty ImagesSome Democrats saw the push as an insult to FDR&#x27;s memory. But there were also many who were growing concerned that FDR had set a dangerous precedent. They argued that the amendment was &quot;not an undemocratic restraint upon the popular will, but a democratic restraint upon any future, dangerously ambitious demagogue,&quot; according to Stathis&#x27; paper.After lengthy negotiations — notably about whether the limit should be two four-year terms or one six-year term — the 22nd Amendment eventually passed Congress in 1947. And it was with the help of some strange bedfellows. Republicans, many of whom were motivated by FDR&#x27;s presidency and others concerned about safeguarding democracy, joined with Southern Democrats upset with then-President Harry Truman for continuing FDR&#x27;s liberal economic policies.Stathis&#x27; paper also notes that more Southern Democrats might have joined if they knew Truman would push forward with his civil rights program:&quot;Soon after the President sent his special civil rights message to Congress on February 2, [1948,] Governor Fielding L. Wright of Mississippi asked the Southern Governors&#x27; Conference to serve notice on Democratic Party leaders that they would no longer tolerate the repeated campaigns for enactment of civil rights legislation. Less than a week later, the Mississippi state legislature voted overwhelmingly for the ratification of the twenty-second amendment.&quot;It seems par for the course in a country whose history and politics tend to revolve around money and race.Trump is not the only president to fantasize about being president longer than two termsAfter being out of office, Democrat Barack Obama said he thought he could have won a third term, if allowed.&quot;I am confident in this vision [of &#x27;hope and change&#x27;] because I&#x27;m confident that if I — if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could&#x27;ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,&quot; Obama said in a podcast episode with former senior adviser David Axelrod. &quot;I know that in conversations that I&#x27;ve had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say the vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one.&quot;Before that, Democrat Bill Clinton, asked if the Constitution would have allowed him to run again, would he? &quot;Oh, I probably would have run again,&quot; Clinton told Rolling Stone after the 2000 election, adding that he thinks he would have won. &quot;Yes. I do. But it&#x27;s hard to say, because it&#x27;s entirely academic.&quot; Clinton even floated that, given people are living longer, maybe the 22nd Amendment should be changed to include only &quot;consecutive&quot; terms.In the 1980s, there was a real movement to try and get Republican President Ronald Reagan to run for a third term.At a 1986 fundraiser for former Texas Gov. Bill Clements, Reagan revealed that, while flying to the national GOP convention two years earlier, he had at least thought about what it would be like to run for a third term, if he could.Then-President Barack Obama, shown here at the White House in 2014 with former President Bill Clinton, said he thought he could have won a third term, if allowed. And Clinton even floated that, given people are living longer, maybe the 22nd Amendment should be changed to include only &quot;consecutive&quot; terms.Charles Dharapak/AP&quot;In fact, flying over the convention center this morning,&quot; he said, &quot;I started asking myself, &#x27;I wonder how folks down there would feel about giving it one more try?&#x27; &quot;That received thunderous applause. &quot;Thank you for that,&quot; he said, &quot;but I&#x27;m kidding, of course.&#x27;&#x27;At a later event, Reagan was more explicit. After being greeted with chants of &quot;four more years,&quot; he voiced his opposition to the 22nd Amendment.&quot;Well, I have to tell you, I think it should be changed,&quot; he said, &quot;because I think it&#x27;s only democratic for the people to be able to vote for someone as many times as they want.&quot;Reagan argued that it should be for future presidents only, not necessarily for him, but that didn&#x27;t stop Republicans from fundraising off it and pushing the idea of repealing it. &quot;Ronald Reagan is one of the greatest American presidents of all time, and I want to keep him on the job,&quot; read a fundraising email from Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, R-Mich., then chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is responsible for trying to help elect Republicans to the House.Vander Jagt proposed a bill in 1986 to repeal it. &quot;The 22nd Amendment is an insult to American voters, who are wise and well-informed,&quot; he said. It went nowhere. But that didn&#x27;t stop other, some fairly powerful, people from trying through the years.In addition to Vander Jagt, who continued to introduce his amendment all the way through the George H.W. Bush administration, now-Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell introduced one of his own in 1995.&quot;I intend to introduce a constitutional amendment, which would repeal the 22nd Amendment because that, too, denied voters the opportunity to choose their president,&quot; he said at the time.(1) The economy improving, Reagan won 49 states in his re-election bid; (2 &amp; 3) since he left office, some talked wistfully about changing the Constitution to let him run again.McConnell wasn&#x27;t alone. That same year, after Clinton had won reelection, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., also introduced 22nd Amendment repeal legislation. He continued to introduce it all the way through Republican George W. Bush&#x27;s presidency. New York Rep. Jose Serrano began introducing similar repeal bills in 1997, but when he introduced one in 2013, after Obama won a second term, it spurred allegations of an effort to make Obama &quot;president for life.&quot;Polarization being what it is in modern politics, it&#x27;s highly unlikely a repeal of the amendment would ever happen. Just think of the bipartisan hoops it would have to go through to become reality: it would need the support of two-thirds of the Senate and the House, and then three-quarters of state legislatures within seven years.And with a Trump candidacy looming, Democrats now would be firmly opposed.

        "description": "By now, the spaceship should have been on its way to the moon. By now, NASA had hoped, the gumdrop-shaped capsule—designed to carry astronauts someday—would be sending all kinds of data back home, showing engineers how its first journey to space was going.But the capsule is still here, sitting atop a giant rocket that has so far refused to leave Earth. NASA spent weeks hyping up the inaugural flight of the Space Launch System, the rocket at the center of America’s ambitious effort to land astronauts on the moon again in this decade. Celebrity appearances and musical performances were lined up. There were enough Krispy Kreme doughnuts at the Kennedy Space Center to feed the whole state of Florida. Even the vice president flew in. And yet, the rocket has stayed put.Plenty of natural factors can lead to a launch delay: nearby lightning, hovering cumulus clouds, the rotation of the planet itself. But in the case of the Space Launch System, the problems were with the rocket. NASA postponed its first attempt, at the end of August, after a sensor indicated an issue with one of the main engines. The agency called off its second attempt this weekend after the liquid-hydrogen tank sprouted a leak too big for engineers to contain. NASA will have a chance to make a third attempt in late September or October, after engineers have pulled the rocket off the launchpad and back indoors to inspect the system and reset its batteries. “We’re not going to launch until it’s right,” Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator, told reporters this weekend. The moon will have to wait a bit longer.Folks in the rocket business weren’t surprised that the Space Launch System didn’t take off on its first, or even second, attempt. Delays happen, and so do leaks; the Space Launch System is a new vehicle made partially out of old, familiar parts from NASA’s now-retired fleet of space shuttles, which experienced their own frustrating share of escaping hydrogen. But two scrapped attempts in one week is a disappointing setback for the country’s new moon program, named Artemis (for Apollo’s sister in Greek mythology).[Read: America is trying to make the moon happen again]The rocket program is already years behind schedule and many taxpayers’ dollars over budget. NASA no longer faces a geopolitical space race, but it does have to contend with competition at home from private rocket manufacturers that have vowed to fly more often and at a lower cost than the government. A series of delays could bolster the argument that maybe NASA, the only organization to ever put human beings on the lunar surface, shouldn’t be in the business of launching moon rockets at all. The successful operation of the Space Launch System is as much about going back to the moon as it is about demonstrating that NASA’s approach is worth it.The first Artemis mission involves the Space Launch System lofting the astronaut capsule, called Orion, on a weeks-long trek around the moon and back. It’s a technical demonstration, a test of countless parts and components to make sure the vehicle is safe for people. If Orion performs as designed, survives the blazing reentry through Earth’s atmosphere, and ends up back in the hands of engineers, NASA will move on to the next stage of the program: another test-drive around the moon, this time with a crew of four astronauts. If that goes well, the next mission will culminate in a landing on the surface.Humankind has done this kind of thing before. From 1969 to 1972, NASA put men on the moon six times, using technology with less computing power than the little devices that manage our 21st-century lives. The astronauts descended to the surface and explored, ate, and slept while the rest of humanity chugged along nearly 240,000 miles away. This time, NASA wants to do things a little differently. The next crew to set foot on the dusty regolith, for example, will not be solely composed of white men; NASA has promised that the group will include the first woman and the first person of color on the moon. And the landings are meant to bring about a sustained presence on the moon, a future with habitats and rovers on the surface and a small space station circling overhead.At the Kennedy Space Center, along the country’s “Space Coast,” people were buzzing with anticipation in the days before both Artemis 1 attempts. Astronauts dressed in blue jumpsuits milled around, sneaking glances at the rocket that could someday be their ride. When I asked Victor Glover, a NASA astronaut who might very well be part of the first crew to land, which Artemis trip he’d want to take, he said, “I don't know, but if they want me on a mission, I’ll be ready when my time comes.”[Read: Why is NASA’s hold music so catchy?]A rocket built for the moon hasn’t flown since 1972. After the crew of Apollo 17 returned, the American space program, subject to political whims and budget fluctuations, turned closer to home. NASA built space shuttles, and astronauts rode them into orbit and helped assemble the International Space Station. The development of the Space Launch System got under way in 2010, and, fueled by bipartisan support and liquid hydrogen, the effort managed to survive several presidential administrations and reach the launchpad this year, bringing the country closer to a moon return than it has been in recent memory.All that history, though, might be slowing NASA down. The Space Launch System design relies on hardware that was used in NASA’s shuttles, which were retired in 2011 after 30 years of operations. The rocket’s fuel includes liquid hydrogen, which, although more efficient, is also more prone to leaks than the methane that other rocket manufacturers have begun to use. And after every launch, NASA’s rocket must ditch some very expensive hardware into the ocean, with no hope of reusing any of it—something that commercial companies have demonstrated they can do.One of those commercial companies, SpaceX, is developing its own moon rocket, known as Starship. A decade ago, the public might have scoffed at the idea of Elon Musk’s rowdy start-up doing anything very historic. But today, SpaceX is NASA’s only ride to the International Space Station, and the agency has signed with the company to launch several of its upcoming missions, including a new space telescope and a probe to study one of Jupiter’s icy moons. Not only that, NASA has also hired SpaceX to produce the lander that future Artemis astronauts will use to ride down to the moon’s surface, plus the spacecraft that will help nudge it toward lunar orbit. In a future where SpaceX technology could do all that, the government rocket might seem almost superfluous. Of course, like NASA’s rocket, Starship will likely face its own issues. But if a Starship explodes, Congress isn’t going to haul in SpaceX officials and demand a formal explanation. The private company can keep going in a way that a federal space agency can't.[Read: Someone show NASA a calendar]NASA has set some very ambitious timelines for the Artemis program, and each one should be taken with a grain of moon dust—especially the working target for the first landing, in 2025. The landing technology from SpaceX is still in the works. The spacesuits have yet to be completed. Even the toilet that will eventually be installed in the Orion capsule—don’t laugh; it’s a crucial piece of technology!—is still being tested on the International Space Station, and according to a NASA engineering manager, it’s running into some problems. NASA budgets haven’t begun to account for the habitats and rovers that astronauts would use after they’ve perfected landing on the surface. America could certainly put astronauts on the moon before this decade is out, but we’re a long way from lunar glamping.This early in the Artemis story, high-profile delays raise all sorts of questions that NASA would rather not answer, ranging from What’s taking so long to get back there? to Why are we even going at all? The American space program has always received mixed reviews. NASA doesn’t talk about it now, but many Americans didn’t support the Apollo program, which unfolded during the late 1960s—a chaotic and painful era in the country’s history. The United States had enough work to do here on this planet without pouring money into leaving it, people argued. Mark Kirasich, the NASA deputy associate administrator in charge of outlining the Artemis program, was 9 years old when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon, and he remembers thinking that, after a feat like that, people would soon travel even deeper into space. In fact, NASA officials envisioned that, after the moon feat, astronauts could reach Mars by the early 1980s. “When you looked at my coloring book, it had all kinds of space vehicles going all over the universe,” Kirasich told me.This time around, NASA’s budget is much smaller, and the agency is selling the public on several reasons for going back to the moon: scientific exploration, economic opportunities, inspiring a new generation. At the Kennedy Space Center, the wrapper of a special launch treat—an Artemis-branded chocolate-covered, marshmallow-topped biscuit—declared that the launch was “for the benefit of all humanity.” The unofficial slogan for Artemis 1—“We are going”—is, in a way, perfect. It offers no immediate explanation; it is free of justification.Whatever the rationale, a triumphant return to the moon can only begin in one place: on the launchpad, with a successful liftoff of a rocket. NASA must now wait for technicians to complete various repairs, including replacing a seal that would prevent liquid hydrogen from flitting out. Hydrogen is the smallest molecule in the universe, which makes it difficult to contain, even with the best materials on the market, Jim Free, NASA’s associate administrator for exploration-systems development, told me this weekend. Free joined NASA in 1990, when the agency spent months trying to find the source of a hydrogen leak in one of the space shuttles. They couldn’t get off the ground without resolving it. When I asked Free whether he thinks that the Space Launch System could face its own frustrating season—that a tiny molecule could stall the nation’s attempt to reach the moon this year—he gave a nervous laugh. “I hope not,” he said.",

        "description": "This is an edition of Up for Debate, a newsletter by Conor Friedersdorf. On Wednesdays, he rounds up timely conversations and solicits reader responses to one thought-provoking question. Later, he publishes some thoughtful replies. Sign up for the newsletter here.Last week I asked readers for their thoughts on Joe Biden’s plan to hire 100,000 additional police officers and his explicit rejection of defunding the police.Jack likes what he heard:\r\n“Defunding the police” would be foolhardy and dangerous. Having a well-funded police force is, in many large cities in America, the bulwark against crime, violence, and mayhem. In addition, the police serve many valuable societal functions besides stemming crime. When I was a paramedic in a former life, it was the police who responded to and were responsible for securing every scene I was on. They performed welfare checks on citizens whose relatives were worried, maintained traffic safety and a whole host of other beneficial things. If someone is breaking into your house or menacing your family, who are you going to call—a social worker? A psychologist?\r\n\r\nAll that said, I am as appalled as anyone by the many instances of police violence against Black people and other minorities under the guise of enforcing the law or keeping the peace. A much larger share of their funding should go toward education, training and psychological testing and treatment. The police are a microcosm of our society both good and bad, and we all see the rage, hatred, and prejudice playing out every day across America and the world. Don’t defund the police—just fund the right parts of policing.\r\n[Read: 1990s policing: Overrated or underrated?]Pat explained her dislike of the cops:\r\nI am no fan of the police. I do not recall a single time a police officer served me or protected me. My Black husband and I have been harassed and treated poorly by police more times than we can recall, so these are incidents that stand out in my memory:\r\n\r\nWe were driving in Chicago one snowy night when the sign “No Right Turn on Red Light 1–3 a.m.” was covered by snow. We made a right turn and then heard the siren and saw the lights behind us. We pulled over; a policeman told my husband he was under arrest. He asked what for. The cop replied that he had made an illegal turn. The two of them walked back to the intersection and saw that the sign was snow-covered. My husband protested, and the cop called for a paddy wagon. My husband was taken to jail.  \r\n\r\nI followed in our car. When I entered the police station, I was greeted with, “Here’s your whore.” I asked what the charges were. They said, “None. He can go.” Another time we had gone to Cleveland for a football game. We were staying at a fine hotel. When we went downstairs to go to dinner, my husband realized he had forgotten his car keys. He told me to wait in the bar until he got back. A man at the bar told me to suck his dick like I did that n-——-. I told my husband when he returned, and he took a step toward the bar. The man twirled on his stool and punched my husband in the face. He didn’t stop there; he kept pummeling him. The bartender called the police and reported a “race riot in progress.” When the police arrived, the fight had moved to the lobby. The police told us we had to leave the hotel. Observers told the police the other guy had started the whole thing. The police left, telling the man to keep his fists to himself, but not that he needed to leave.\r\n\r\nIn Reno, we lived in a house across the street from a state policeman. His daughter and ours were the same age and played together until he came home one day and saw our daughter and his playing in his front yard. He had fits and forbade his daughter to have anything to do with ours. Several months later, police knocked on our door and said they received a notice that my husband was burglarizing the neighborhood. It was about 1 a.m. My husband had gone to the door in his bathrobe, followed by our dog. Our Porsche was in the driveway. He told the police that unless they could show him a warrant for a Black man in a bathrobe with a dog, driving a Porsche and burglarizing in Reno, he was going to file a complaint with the community-relations bureau. They left.\r\n\r\nFinally, here in California my car was hit by another car being driven in an adjoining lane. I was driving. When the sheriff arrived at my window, his first question was, “Who was really driving?”\r\n\r\nI once taught at a college which had a police academy. Until 3 years before I retired, there were no nonwhite male cadets, and I had some of those cadets in my classes. I have no hope that any of them are working to eradicate the racism that pervades many police departments. I say don’t fund the police: Fund mandatory personality profiles as a condition of hiring and intense diversity training after hiring until the racists are weeded out.\r\nJosh would rather spend the money elsewhere:\r\nMy dad was a police officer from the late 1980s to 2019. My thoughts on policing have always been through the eyes of a son who worried about his dad when he left for work. On September 10, 2001, he was on his police motorbike when he was hit by a drunk driver and almost lost a leg. He later moved on to work in an affluent suburb. He ended his career a K9 officer.\r\n\r\nThe first few years of his career he spent walking a public-housing beat in an urban police department so strapped for cash that he had to purchase his own firearm. His fondest memories of policing came from that beat, where he knew the folks who sat on the stoop and hung out. If they were drinking alcohol, he would tell them to put it in a paper bag. He says that, once, a member of the community talked back to him, but before my dad could say anything, the person’s group told him to be nice to my dad because they knew him; they trusted him. Nowadays, I walk around D.C., where I live, or in Michigan, where I grew up, and if I see police, they are likely scrolling on their phones, sitting in their air-conditioned cars.\r\n\r\nMy dad had a degree in criminal science from Kent State. Nowadays, he believes departments lower employment standards to keep a full force, but that has negative consequences. He also constantly denied promotions offered to him, not wanting to be involved with the politics of police leadership and city government. Police spend so much time on conflict resolution and things that Americans can’t seem to do themselves. Cities without mental-health services rely on police to solve them. We have injected police into schools, leading to more arrests and detentions of juveniles, because schools are incapable of meeting students’ emotional needs. When someone steals food because they cannot afford to eat, we toss them in jail instead of getting them help. We ask the police to do so much. When I hear “defund” the police, I think about moving that money into the city services that could address the problems that police are unequipped (and I’d argue, unwilling) to handle.\r\n\r\nMy biggest issue with policing today is the cost of police misconduct. A FiveThirtyEight analysis shows that in the past 10 years, 3 billion dollars have been spent settling misconduct civil cases. Where does that money come from? Most often the city budget. Not the police budget, the city budget. If their expensive misconduct is subsidized by the very community they “protect and serve,” then what is the point of policing? We can hire all the cops we want, but will it really solve the most pressing issues? I say no, and a deeper investment in other civil projects would be of better use.\r\nJay thinks that the left undervalues the police:\r\nI’m a liberal through and through, and something that I’m old enough to remember most liberal and nonliberals agreeing on was the primary need for incarceration, punishment, and removal from the streets of those who broke not just our laws but the public trust. The tremendous reduction in U.S. violent crime in the ’90s and ’00s provided the “luxury,” I would say, to tinker with this model—but rather than tinker, my fellow liberals and our progressive fellow travelers ridiculously overcorrected to the point where, especially in our larger cities, it’s now exceptionally easy to break a law and not get caught, or to get caught and not be punished in any way. We can see where this is leading, and the desirability of police work is plummeting as a result, with our safety alongside it.\r\n\r\n“Root-cause analysis” is important, and should be left to those who know what they’re doing—not to activists. More important, the job of America’s district attorneys, police, and politicians is to catch and prosecute those who break the law—that’s it; end of story.\r\nAlex defends the “defund the police” wing of the Black Lives Matter movement:\r\nBLM doesn’t want a world with gang violence, crime, death, shootings, extortions, etc. They want a world where their fathers, their sons get to stay alive, get to stay as part of their family, get to live and thrive. They can’t do that in prison. BLM supporters view the actions of the police as the most targetable source of the murder and suffering they face on a daily basis. They see the “cure” as worse than the “condition” of the daily violence they live with, as so much overkill, the way white people might imagine the idea of calling in SWAT to break up a playground dispute between elementary schoolers.\r\nSaul defends 1990s policing:\r\nAs a 75-year-old lifelong New Yorker who has seen this city in numerous permutations, at its nadir and best, I can say unequivocally that ’90s zero-tolerance policing was the best thing that ever happened here. Bill Bratton, Ray Kelly, and their ilk are needed, and the city would do its best to keep them cloned indefinitely. One felt safe mostly everywhere.\r\n[Read: 19 readers on Donald Trump’s legal future]David shares conclusions that he came to while working in the legal system:\r\nThere are many situations that escalate due to citizens not understanding, or caring, how police are trained. In general, they are trained to escalate force quickly to gain control over potentially volatile situations. They are not trained to engage in negotiations with recalcitrant suspects to secure compliance. Thus, verbal commands give way to control holds; which give way to chemical agents, batons, Tasers; which give way to deadly force—and officers need not try every step along the way. They are legally entitled to use force that an objectively reasonable officer could have deemed necessary, if placed in the same position and judging from the position of the officer at the scene, not with 20/20 hindsight. The upshot is that the failure of a person with the physical capacity to threaten an officer’s safety to follow police commands can quickly lead to serious injury from a takedown, baton strikes, or worse. Police are trained to be very wary of potential threats, and the Second Amendment justifies their caution, given the prevalence of firearms in the citizenry. If a reasonable officer could have felt the need to use the same level of force as an officer who injured someone, then the injured person will have no legal recourse for their injuries and the officer will not face internal discipline.\r\n\r\nIt can be extremely difficult to hold police accountable for alleged misconduct in conservative jurisdictions where jurors (and judges) are more likely to side with police than injured suspects. Cellphones and body cameras may be leveling the playing field, but not all encounters are recorded. It is not always easy to find competent legal counsel willing and able to take on public entities on behalf of flawed clients. Most officers have civil-service protection and skilled legal representation in civil-service proceedings over proposed discipline, so departments cannot always discipline wayward officers.\r\n\r\nBut defunding the police is a terrible idea. Since when does paying people less improve their performance? While police reform is a slow process, most successful changes are incremental, not radical. Demoralizing the police is not a great way to motivate them to “protect and serve.” While they should do their jobs, if they are understaffed (lots of retirements) and resentful, they probably won’t do it effectively, as Portland and Seattle are finding out. To sum up, officers do need to be held more accountable for actual misconduct, and steps should be taken to try to eliminate officers covering for each other. However, the public (and the press) need to better understand what constitutes actionable police misconduct before sensationalizing every act of police violence, especially before all evidence is known. Fast coverage is rarely good coverage. Vilifying officers for lawful conduct creates a siege mentality, justifying their impulse to cover for each other.\r\nBen tried to reform the police in Seattle:\r\nIn 2018 I got involved with my local legislative district’s Democratic Party. Seattle was a community in upheaval. As our resident tech employers began to really grow, our economy and population was overwhelmed. Everything became ludicrously expensive, and the city, built for a simpler and less populous time, was in no position to absorb the shock.\r\n\r\nAlong with the boom came spikes in our homeless population, and our middle class got squeezed harder and harder. People working service jobs couldn’t afford to live near where they worked. Developers began putting in “communal living” buildings where impoverished young workers and students could eke out a life in tiny studios with shared kitchens and bathrooms. The chemical composition of meth changed during that time too, and those who struggled with drugs became more addled, faster. Crime spiked. Homelessness exploded. Our city was great, and it was suffering, all at the same time.\r\n\r\nAgainst this backdrop, consider the Seattle Police Department. Despite Seattle’s reputation as a “liberal bastion,” its police department was a far cry from the “light on crime” reputation cities like ours carried. The department has had a long history of abusive practices and poor accountability. Eventually (well before George Floyd died), they entered a consent decree with the Justice Department. I got to see how that played out firsthand when a bank I worked at was subpoenaed by the department. The detective informed me that he needed the bank’s footage of an arrest because the consent decree required them to provide oversight over rough arrests. It was an illuminating conversation.\r\n\r\nSo the police had issues. But by the time I got into local politics, things were hitting a nadir. Policing was our city’s solution for seemingly every problem. With a budget of $400 million per year, police were asked to address every call related to homelessness (including loitering, and moving people who were just incredibly high and angry) and every domestic call; to record every vehicle break-in; and of course, to investigate every major crime.\r\n\r\nPolice morale was horrible. Their retention rate was (and continues to be) abysmal. Their reputation, and their relationship, with our community was extremely tense. Petty crime and major crimes were (and are) all up. Essentially, every possible stakeholder—the community, the police, and the government—were all miserable, and by every possible metric.\r\n\r\nMy congressional district was one of the most liberal and democratic in the country. Our representative in Congress is Pramila Jayapal, for reference. So after George Floyd died, I had thought that the time was ripe for us to finally make some changes. I argued that we ought to dissolve the SPD and create a new public-safety agency, which would report to the county executive instead of the city. We would not only leverage the larger resources of King County, but we would also invest way more in public safety—my initial estimate was in the ballpark of $200 million (the city’s budget was $6 billion at the time).\r\n\r\nThe new Public Safety Service would have multiple departments—one of which would be armed officers, whose job would be to respond to and investigate major crimes and unsafe situations. Other departments would include a mental-health-crisis response, a civil-service department (cleanup, homelessness issues, taking police reports for petty crimes), and a few others. Only the armed police would carry weapons, and they would be reserved for situations both that required an armed response and that they were trained for.\r\n\r\nThe idea didn’t come out of whole cloth. I grew up in New Jersey, and I was inspired by how Camden helped improve their public safety. By dissolving their police department and merging safety with the county, they got more resources (more police, not fewer) and they eliminated the excessive protections their local police union gave to misbehaving officers. Given where we lived, I thought that this idea would be received very enthusiastically, but as you can probably guess, my organization declined to start pushing the proposals. It never got in front of our elected representatives. The city’s leadership continued to argue about the issue along the margins. Very little had changed.\r\n\r\nThe partisan story we often tell about policing and crime doesn’t do us any service. Making things better will require a more holistic approach. Just as it is insufficient to be “tough on crime,” it is also not a fix if we “defund the police.” We need better, more proactive, and more accountable policing. We need more resources in the areas where our communities have the greatest need. And to do this, we will have to summon courage. A real fix will mean tough decisions, money spent, and constituencies angered. It’s hard, complicated, and risky. But the problem won’t go away if we ignore it. It’s time for us to start doing the hard work to help repair the communities we hold so dear.\r\nChadd wrote about racism in the criminal-justice system:\r\nAs a returned citizen felon, I have more than just some thoughts on crime and policing. I’m also a straight, cis, white male. And the reason I state that is just to put it out there that yes, 100 percent, without question, from what I’ve seen and my experience with the justice system, it is irrevocably broken, unfair, unjust, and absolutely without a doubt systemically racist in its application and outcomes. Throughout my late teens and early 20s, I developed quite an advanced addiction habit (I’m now seven years clean and grateful to talk about this stuff with a clear head). Without getting too detailed, I’ll just say it culminated in my arrest for multiple high-class felonies. If I’d taken it to trial, I would have been facing 28 years.\r\n\r\nObviously that isn’t what happened, and I’m thankful I was given an opportunity to prove I could function in society (and thanks to voters in Florida, now I can vote). But, after educating myself while I was in (I did two years), reading, learning more about government, drug policy, policing, and the war on drugs, I started to see wild ideas as not so wild anymore. My outcome was the result of absolute privilege, and I am willing to acknowledge how unfair and unjust the system is to so many people. It’s humbling to know that I could’ve effectively ended my young adult life had it not been for the color of my skin, the family and support system I have, where I was born, and how I look. It’s flat-out unfair, it perpetuates the same system that we have, and there’s no end in sight.\r\nMelanie favors a different response to rising crime:\r\nCrime is so high now because we didn’t institute some of the lessons learned in the 1990s. Boston pioneered youth-violence-prevention initiatives that focused on teaching conflict-resolution skills and minimizing social determinants of violence such as poverty, child abuse, unemployment, and mental-health and substance-abuse issues.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1990s, what has been called “the largest public health study you’ve never heard of” was published, giving researchers, public-health officials and everyone interested in fixing social problems a huge windfall—the Adverse Childhood Experiences study demonstrated that addiction, mental illness, poverty, employment struggles, suicide, and other problems all were directly related to child abuse, neglect, and trauma. And researchers had known how to prevent much child abuse and trauma for 20 years.\r\n\r\nBut we weren’t prepared to drop our focus on crime being fixed by policing. Preventing social problems by protecting children didn”t fit any partisan worldview, so it was easily neglected.\r\n\r\nNow we have had another generation come of age without our society’s investment in preventing adverse childhood experiences. And they’re hurt and angry and had to live two years with the very few sources of stability and support in their lives interrupted by the pandemic. Now we even have clear proof that ACEs are directly tied to involvement in the criminal-justice system. And we’re still not talking about prevention. We”re not talking about preventing children from experiencing abuse, neglect, and trauma. We’re limiting our options to discussions of “Do we lock up the hurting? Or do we invest in expensive treatments to minimize the amount of damage they do to our society?” But we’re not talking about investing in prevention, the only humane choice. And in doing so, we’re setting the stage to have this same conversation in 20 more years.\r\nJulie describes a negative change in policing:\r\nFor over 40 years, I was a social worker who specialized in the assessment and treatment of child abuse. This required me to work closely with law enforcement throughout the intermountain states.\r\n\r\nIn the past two decades, I saw a change in the attitudes, manners, and personalities of officers—not all of them, but many. This played out with displays of machismo, refusal to follow patient safety rules in the hospital, and unreasonable demands of personnel. When thwarted, they threatened. Some of the changes in attitude solidified after the Bush administration pushed military equipment to law enforcement, essentially militarizing police officers. I also think that the free-for-all gun ownership in this country has made it impossible for police officers to feel safe without military-grade protection and weapons. We need more police officers, but we need fewer of the macho type, using the job to prove their manhood. They need training in psychology and human behavior. They need to know how and when to de-escalate rather than exacerbate. And we need to get rid of all the guns out there that contribute daily to making all of us much less safe.\r\nAs always, thanks for all of your emails. I read each and every one. See you tomorrow.",

More than 1,000 Australian early childhood education centres are predicted to go on strike today seeking better pay and conditions. Economists expect a slowdown for the Australian economy as interest rates continue to rise. And there are concerns for the health of an Australian held in a Baghdad jail.At least 1,000 childcare centres across the country are expected to close their doors on Wednesday to protest low wages and conditions in what unions say is the biggest industrial action early educators have taken. The executive director of early education at the United Workers Union, Helen Gibbons, estimated 70,000 families would be affected. She said she expected “many more” centres were planning to join the action and attend rallies.  Continue reading...",

        "description": "People check in to vote at Edmondson Westside High School during Maryland's primary election, Tuesday, July 19, 2022, in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez)\n\n\n\nWelcome to The Hill’s Campaign Report, tracking all things related to the 2022 midterm elections. Starting this week, you can expect this newsletter in your inbox every&nbsp;Tuesday,&nbsp;Wednesday&nbsp;and&nbsp;Thursday&nbsp;leading up to November's election.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEmail us tips and feedback: Max Greenwood (mgreenwood@thehill.com), Julia Manchester (jmanchester@thehill.com), and Caroline Vakil (cvakil@thehill.com).  \n\n\n\nFall campaign sprint begins\n\n\n\nIt’s the day after Labor Day, which means one thing in the world of politics: The fall campaign sprint has begun.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith only about two months to go before Election Day and most of the nation’s primaries wrapped up, expect to see candidates ramping up their campaign operations quickly. That means more ads, more campaign stops and, yes, more aggressive attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn light of that, here’s a rundown of where things stand:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe battle for the House: Democrats are scrambling to protect one of the narrowest House majorities in decades. Republicans need to flip just five seats to recapture control of the lower chamber and they could pick up as many as three or four of those seats through redistricting alone. At the same time, Democrats are still grappling with the historical reality that the party in power tends to lose ground in Congress during midterm elections, as well as the fact that inflation remains high and President Biden’s approval ratings remain underwater. \n\n\n\nOf course, the political environment has improved for Democrats somewhat in recent months. The Supreme Court’s decision in June to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights case, gave the party’s voters a burst of energy over the summer and there are signs that inflation and gas prices may be easing somewhat, even if they remain elevated. Nevertheless, Republicans are still favored to recapture the House this year, given the party’s favorable redistricting outcome, decent candidate recruitment and a slew of Democratic retirements. \n\n\n\nThe Senate map: The Senate was always expected to be easier for Democrats to hold than the House. Despite the fact that it’s split 50-50 between the two parties, Republicans are defending more seats this year, including the seats of several retiring incumbents like Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio).  \n\n\n\nWhile the unfavorable political environment for Democrats that has defined most of the past year still puts the party’s Senate majority in jeopardy, there are signs that things may be improving here too for Democrats. Republicans in several crucial battleground states ultimately nominated a series of untested, Trump-endorsed candidates who have struggled to get their general election campaigns off the ground, while Democrats have appeared to pull ahead in polling and fundraising.  \n\n\n\nBut don’t count Republicans out. The battle for control of the Senate still looks like a toss-up, and GOP groups are getting ready to spend big in the coming months. And even if things look good for Democrats now, any political strategist will tell you that there’s no guarantee that will remain the case for the next two months. \n\n\n\nPrimary Day in Massachusetts \n\n\n\nThere’s not expected to be too many surprises in Massachusetts’ top-of-the-ticket primaries.&nbsp;State Attorney General Maura Healey&nbsp;is running virtually unopposed for the Democratic nomination for governor; her last serious challenger, state Sen. Sonia Chang-Díaz, dropped out of the race in June, though her name is still technically on the ballot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Republican primary, meanwhile, is at least a little bit more competitive. Former President Trump has endorsed&nbsp;former state Rep. Geoff Diehl&nbsp;in that race, making him the favorite to win the nomination on Tuesday. But he still faces a challenge from&nbsp;businessman Chris Doughty, who has also notched some influential endorsements.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most competitive race on the ballot on Tuesday is the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor. Three candidates are seeking the nomination: State Senator Eric Lesser, state Representative Tami Gouveia and Salem Mayor Kim Driscoll, who has benefited from more than $1 million in spending by an aligned super PAC. \n\n\n\nOn the Republican side, Diehl-aligned Leah Cole Allen is facing off against Kate Campanale for the party’s nomination for lieutenant governor. \n\n\n\nOne other race to watch: Tanisha Sullivan, the president of the NAACP’s Boston branch, is challenging longtime incumbent Bill Galvin, a Democrat who’s seeking renomination for another term as Massachusetts secretary of state. Galvin has held the office for 27 years.  \n\n\n\nON THE TRAIL \n\n\n\nBack to Ohio:&nbsp;Trump is set to&nbsp;return to Ohio&nbsp;on Sept. 17 for a rally boosting Republican Senate nominee J.D. Vance and “the entire Ohio Trump ticket,” the former president’s leadership PAC announced on Tuesday. It’s the latest sign that Trump is entering general election mode as the fall campaign season ramps up. Over the weekend, the former president traveled to Pennsylvania to rally support for endorsed candidates there.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA break with Trump:&nbsp;Mehmet Oz, the celebrity physician and Republican Senate nominee in Pennsylvania, says that he&nbsp;would have voted to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election&nbsp;if he had been in the Senate at the time. “I would not have objected to it,” Oz said at a press conference alongside Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) on Tuesday. “By the time the delegates and those reports were sent to the U.S. Senate, our job was to approve it, which is what I would have done.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy it matters: Oz won the Republican nomination to succeed Toomey, who’s retiring, after scoring Trump’s endorsement. And while his comments aren’t controversial, they still put him at odds with the former president, who sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election and continues to claim that widespread voter fraud robbed him of a second term in the White House. Of course, Oz will need to broaden his appeal among Pennsylvania voters if he wants a chance at winning the Senate seat in November. But his remarks could turn off Trump’s most ardent supporters, who remain a key Republican voting bloc. \n\n\n\nAD WATCH \n\n\n\nRoe v. Wade fallout:&nbsp;The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) is launching its first general election ad in Nevada targeting Republican nominee Adam Laxalt over his stance on abortion, The Hill’s Zach Schonfeld&nbsp;reports. The spot, which is part of the group’s $8.4 million fall ad reservation in Nevada, notes Laxalt’s praise of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade, as well as his description of the landmark abortion rights case as a “joke.” “Laxalt supported overturning Nevada’s abortion protections,” the ad says. “He’d let states outlaw it, even for victims of rape and incest. Adam Laxalt’s not for us.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBig money: Republican-aligned groups are getting ready to hit the airwaves in key Senate battleground states with a nine-figure ad blitz, NBC News reports. Among those groups is the Senate Leadership Fund (SLF), the Senate GOP-aligned super PAC, which is getting ready to go on the air with the rest of a $169.2 million advertising campaign in key states. The hefty spending comes as many GOP Senate candidates struggle to keep pace with their Democratic opponents in fundraising – a trend that has forced outside groups like SLF to ramp up their own spending. \n\n\n\nOP-EDS FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\n\n\n\nTrump’s ‘Dirty Dozen’ — 12 Republican candidates to keep an eye on, By Al Hunt, former executive editor of Bloomberg NewsWill Joe Manchin run for president? By Keith Naughton of Silent Majority StrategiesAn alternative strategy for Democrats to secure the midterms, By political consultant Douglas E.

        "description": "The city of Baltimore has issued a boil water advisory in western sections of the city after officials detected E.coli in some water samples.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a news release on Monday, the city’s Department of Public Works (DPW) said it found the contamination during routine testing at the West Baltimore neighborhoods of Sandtown-Winchester and Harlem Park.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe advisory affects about 1,500 residential and commercial facilities in the West Baltimore area, including some areas in neighboring Baltimore and Howard counties, the city said. \n\n\n\n“As an extra precaution, DPW will be sampling and surveying the communities in the area of the facilities where the original sampling was performed,” the department wrote in a tweet on Monday. “Right now, the impact appears only at the facilities listed above, and they are being told to use water for flushing only.”\n\n\n\nE.coli is a bacterial specimen that can cause diarrhea, cramps, nausea and headaches. It poses a particular health risk to young children, the elderly and people with severely compromised immune systems. \n\n\n\nThe DPW recommended that residents living in the impacted areas boil their water for a minute before using it, noting that boiled and bottled water can be used to brush teeth, wash fruits and vegetables, feed pets, and prepare food.\n\n\n\nIn a news conference on Monday, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D) said that officials retested the bacterial specimen to confirm the contamination before notifying the public, according to The Baltimore Sun.\n\n\n\n“We are taking this issue very seriously,” Scott said at the news conference. “This is why we’re here with a full operation of our operation center.”\n\n\n\nIn a tweet, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said that he and his officials have received a briefing on the situation from the state’s Department of Environment, which is currently assisting city officials on the matter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"We continue to monitor the situation,\" he added. \n\n\n\nBaltimore is the latest U.S. city to experience problems with its main water system. \n\n\n\nParts of metro Detroit were under a boil water advisory after storms last week, and Jackson, Miss., has been under a boil water advisory since July, along with water outages after massive flooding last month. \n\n\n\nIn a news conference on Monday, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R) said that the state will explore numerous long-term options in an effort to fix the city’s main water system, which has been a longtime problem.",

        "description": "Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the Democratic nominee for the state’s open Senate seat, released an ad on Tuesday contrasting his statements defending legal abortion access for women with those of his Republican opponent, Mehmet Oz, calling the procedure “murder.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFetterman’s video came after audio of comments Oz made about abortion during a virtual town hall in May came to light. Oz said in response to a question from a caller about his stance on abortion that he believes life begins at conception and that he has said that “multiple times.” \n\n\n\n“If life starts at conception, why do you care what stage our heart starts beating at? It’s, you know, it’s still murder if you were to terminate a child whether their heart’s beating or not,” Oz said. \n\n\n\nFetterman’s ad features the audio of Oz interspersed with comments Fetterman has made promising to support Roe v. Wade, which protected a federal right to abortion before the Supreme Court overturned the decision in June. \n\n\n\nThe ad also shows Oz saying in interviews that Roe was decided wrongly and that the issue of abortion access should be left to the states to decide. Fetterman says in the video that he would support abolishing the filibuster in the Senate for the purpose of codifying Roe into law and that he would consider a potential Supreme Court nominee’s stance on Roe to be part of his litmus test for deciding whether they would receive his support. \n\n\n\nFetterman said in a release that women should not believe Oz’s claim at a press conference on Tuesday that he does not support criminalizing abortion for patients or doctors.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Oz’s campaign said in response to the audio that Oz is “pro-life” but supports exceptions for instances of rape, incest and protecting the life of the mother.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFetterman said in the release that Oz has said on multiple occasions that the only exception to abortion restrictions that he supports is to protect the mother’s life.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of coronavirus cases, especially of newer omicron variants, are still relatively high in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new bivalent version of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are now authorized and available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccinated individuals are eligible for this new shot, at least two months after a previous shot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly two years since the original coronavirus vaccines were given emergency authorization for use, we now have an updated vaccine that can be given as a booster shot. Here’s what we currently know about the new bivalent vaccine, who should get it and when.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat is the new booster shot?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBoth Pfizer and Moderna/BioNTech have new versions of their mRNA vaccines for COVID-19.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe updated coronavirus vaccine is bivalent, meaning that is contains the mRNA vaccine for the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 and the mRNA vaccine for another strain. In this case, it is the omicron strain, specifically targeting a part that is found in both the BA.4 and BA.5 variants.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the use of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech Bivalent COVID-19 vaccines as boosters on Aug. 31, and the next day the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially gave its recommendation for it. “The updated Covid-19 boosters are formulated to better protect against the most recently circulating Covid-19 variant,” Rochelle Walensky, who is director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a statement. “They can help restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination and were designed to provide broader protection against newer variants.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIs it safe?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe vaccine makers have been testing bivalent versions of their vaccines in humans with mRNA developed to target the first omicron strain, also known as BA.1. There was a better immune response in people who got the bivalent version compared to people who got the original formulation, or monovalent vaccine. Side effects were similar to the original vaccines.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis version targeting BA.4 and BA.5 has been tested in mice, but not yet in humans. Because the vaccine is not very different from previous versions, health researchers and experts are confident that the safety profile will remain similar enough to go ahead and authorize it for use. The safety data from the previous version is also relevant because the new version is “manufactured using the same process,” according to the FDA. The data in humans will be monitored as it becomes available.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe new bivalent versions of the vaccine could soon be widely available. Shipments have gone out to locations around the country, and some clinics have reported they have started administering the shots.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIs it effective?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe current data are for trials in mice, which are promising. We’re still waiting for more data to be released.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWho is eligible&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPeople who are fully vaccinated are eligible for this booster shot. People who have also gotten one or two booster shots are also eligible, although the shots can’t be too close together in timing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nChildren are not yet eligible for the most part, yet. The Pfizer/BioNTech boosters were authorized for people 12 and older, and Moderna’s for people 18 and older. The FDA has said they will wait on more data before it is authorized for children.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen you should get the shot&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe FDA states that people should wait at least two months after a previous vaccination.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

Compared to before COVID, it’s only 90 percent of the average.This year did include one of the top six days for attendance at the fair for all time. On Saturday, the sunny and temperate weather brought just short of a quarter million people to the grounds.Fair officials said even before the gates opened this year that they did not anticipate record attendance, as many Minnesotans were still hesitant about COVID, inflation and public safety concerns.Attendance clocked in at 1.8 million for the Minnesota State fair in 2022.APM Research Lab",

        "description": "By now, the spaceship should have been on its way to the moon. By now, NASA had hoped, the gumdrop-shaped capsule—designed to carry astronauts someday—would be sending all kinds of data back home, showing engineers how its first journey to space was going.But the capsule is still here, sitting atop a giant rocket that has so far refused to leave Earth. NASA spent weeks hyping up the inaugural flight of the Space Launch System, the rocket at the center of America’s ambitious effort to land astronauts on the moon again in this decade. Celebrity appearances and musical performances were lined up. There were enough Krispy Kreme doughnuts at the Kennedy Space Center to feed the whole state of Florida. Even the vice president flew in. And yet, the rocket has stayed put.Plenty of natural factors can lead to a launch delay: nearby lightning, hovering cumulus clouds, the rotation of the planet itself. But in the case of the Space Launch System, the problems were with the rocket. NASA postponed its first attempt, at the end of August, after a sensor indicated an issue with one of the main engines. The agency called off its second attempt this weekend after the liquid-hydrogen tank sprouted a leak too big for engineers to contain. NASA will have a chance to make a third attempt in late September or October, after engineers have pulled the rocket off the launchpad and back indoors to inspect the system and reset its batteries. “We’re not going to launch until it’s right,” Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator, told reporters this weekend. The moon will have to wait a bit longer.Folks in the rocket business weren’t surprised that the Space Launch System didn’t take off on its first, or even second, attempt. Delays happen, and so do leaks; the Space Launch System is a new vehicle made partially out of old, familiar parts from NASA’s now-retired fleet of space shuttles, which experienced their own frustrating share of escaping hydrogen. But two scrapped attempts in one week is a disappointing setback for the country’s new moon program, named Artemis (for Apollo’s sister in Greek mythology).[Read: America is trying to make the moon happen again]The rocket program is already years behind schedule and many taxpayers’ dollars over budget. NASA no longer faces a geopolitical space race, but it does have to contend with competition at home from private rocket manufacturers that have vowed to fly more often and at a lower cost than the government. A series of delays could bolster the argument that maybe NASA, the only organization to ever put human beings on the lunar surface, shouldn’t be in the business of launching moon rockets at all. The successful operation of the Space Launch System is as much about going back to the moon as it is about demonstrating that NASA’s approach is worth it.The first Artemis mission involves the Space Launch System lofting the astronaut capsule, called Orion, on a weeks-long trek around the moon and back. It’s a technical demonstration, a test of countless parts and components to make sure the vehicle is safe for people. If Orion performs as designed, survives the blazing reentry through Earth’s atmosphere, and ends up back in the hands of engineers, NASA will move on to the next stage of the program: another test-drive around the moon, this time with a crew of four astronauts. If that goes well, the next mission will culminate in a landing on the surface.Humankind has done this kind of thing before. From 1969 to 1972, NASA put men on the moon six times, using technology with less computing power than the little devices that manage our 21st-century lives. The astronauts descended to the surface and explored, ate, and slept while the rest of humanity chugged along nearly 240,000 miles away. This time, NASA wants to do things a little differently. The next crew to set foot on the dusty regolith, for example, will not be solely composed of white men; NASA has promised that the group will include the first woman and the first person of color on the moon. And the landings are meant to bring about a sustained presence on the moon, a future with habitats and rovers on the surface and a small space station circling overhead.At the Kennedy Space Center, along the country’s “Space Coast,” people were buzzing with anticipation in the days before both Artemis 1 attempts. Astronauts dressed in blue jumpsuits milled around, sneaking glances at the rocket that could someday be their ride. When I asked Victor Glover, a NASA astronaut who might very well be part of the first crew to land, which Artemis trip he’d want to take, he said, “I don't know, but if they want me on a mission, I’ll be ready when my time comes.”[Read: Why is NASA’s hold music so catchy?]A rocket built for the moon hasn’t flown since 1972. After the crew of Apollo 17 returned, the American space program, subject to political whims and budget fluctuations, turned closer to home. NASA built space shuttles, and astronauts rode them into orbit and helped assemble the International Space Station. The development of the Space Launch System got under way in 2010, and, fueled by bipartisan support and liquid hydrogen, the effort managed to survive several presidential administrations and reach the launchpad this year, bringing the country closer to a moon return than it has been in recent memory.All that history, though, might be slowing NASA down. The Space Launch System design relies on hardware that was used in NASA’s shuttles, which were retired in 2011 after 30 years of operations. The rocket’s fuel includes liquid hydrogen, which, although more efficient, is also more prone to leaks than the methane that other rocket manufacturers have begun to use. And after every launch, NASA’s rocket must ditch some very expensive hardware into the ocean, with no hope of reusing any of it—something that commercial companies have demonstrated they can do.One of those commercial companies, SpaceX, is developing its own moon rocket, known as Starship. A decade ago, the public might have scoffed at the idea of Elon Musk’s rowdy start-up doing anything very historic. But today, SpaceX is NASA’s only ride to the International Space Station, and the agency has signed with the company to launch several of its upcoming missions, including a new space telescope and a probe to study one of Jupiter’s icy moons. Not only that, NASA has also hired SpaceX to produce the lander that future Artemis astronauts will use to ride down to the moon’s surface, plus the spacecraft that will help nudge it toward lunar orbit. In a future where SpaceX technology could do all that, the government rocket might seem almost superfluous. Of course, like NASA’s rocket, Starship will likely face its own issues. But if a Starship explodes, Congress isn’t going to haul in SpaceX officials and demand a formal explanation. The private company can keep going in a way that a federal space agency can't.[Read: Someone show NASA a calendar]NASA has set some very ambitious timelines for the Artemis program, and each one should be taken with a grain of moon dust—especially the working target for the first landing, in 2025. The landing technology from SpaceX is still in the works. The spacesuits have yet to be completed. Even the toilet that will eventually be installed in the Orion capsule—don’t laugh; it’s a crucial piece of technology!—is still being tested on the International Space Station, and according to a NASA engineering manager, it’s running into some problems. NASA budgets haven’t begun to account for the habitats and rovers that astronauts would use after they’ve perfected landing on the surface. America could certainly put astronauts on the moon before this decade is out, but we’re a long way from lunar glamping.This early in the Artemis story, high-profile delays raise all sorts of questions that NASA would rather not answer, ranging from What’s taking so long to get back there? to Why are we even going at all? The American space program has always received mixed reviews. NASA doesn’t talk about it now, but many Americans didn’t support the Apollo program, which unfolded during the late 1960s—a chaotic and painful era in the country’s history. The United States had enough work to do here on this planet without pouring money into leaving it, people argued. Mark Kirasich, the NASA deputy associate administrator in charge of outlining the Artemis program, was 9 years old when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon, and he remembers thinking that, after a feat like that, people would soon travel even deeper into space. In fact, NASA officials envisioned that, after the moon feat, astronauts could reach Mars by the early 1980s. “When you looked at my coloring book, it had all kinds of space vehicles going all over the universe,” Kirasich told me.This time around, NASA’s budget is much smaller, and the agency is selling the public on several reasons for going back to the moon: scientific exploration, economic opportunities, inspiring a new generation. At the Kennedy Space Center, the wrapper of a special launch treat—an Artemis-branded chocolate-covered, marshmallow-topped biscuit—declared that the launch was “for the benefit of all humanity.” The unofficial slogan for Artemis 1—“We are going”—is, in a way, perfect. It offers no immediate explanation; it is free of justification.Whatever the rationale, a triumphant return to the moon can only begin in one place: on the launchpad, with a successful liftoff of a rocket. NASA must now wait for technicians to complete various repairs, including replacing a seal that would prevent liquid hydrogen from flitting out. Hydrogen is the smallest molecule in the universe, which makes it difficult to contain, even with the best materials on the market, Jim Free, NASA’s associate administrator for exploration-systems development, told me this weekend. Free joined NASA in 1990, when the agency spent months trying to find the source of a hydrogen leak in one of the space shuttles. They couldn’t get off the ground without resolving it. When I asked Free whether he thinks that the Space Launch System could face its own frustrating season—that a tiny molecule could stall the nation’s attempt to reach the moon this year—he gave a nervous laugh. “I hope not,” he said.",

Today's roster moves: Here and here.\nTuesday notes...\n\n\nATTENDANCE WATCH: The Cubs have sold 2,163,550 tickets for 66 dates. With 15 games remaining, they must average 22,430 per game to reach 2.5 million. It’s gonna be close.\n\nPLAYING THEM EVEN: The Cubs are 21-21 since the All-Star break, with 24 of those 42 games against playoff contending teams. In those 24 games the Cubs are 10-14, so they are 11-7 in games against non-contenders since the ASB. Only six of the remaining 28 games are against contending teams (three vs. the Mets in New York, three vs. the Phillies at Wrigley Field).\n\nHIT THAT FIRST PITCH!: The Cubs are batting .369 (185-for-502) when putting the first pitch of an at-bat in play, the top mark in the majors. The Rockies are second with a .363 BA when putting the first pitch of an at-bat in play.\n\nNOW KEEP THOSE LEADS!: The Cubs have scored first in 78 of their 134 games this year, but have gone just 40-38 in those contests. The 78 games scoring first are third-most in the majors behind the Mets (81) and Astros (81) and the 38 defeats in those games are most in the majors (the Reds are second with 28 losses in games when scoring first).\n\nHere are today’s particulars.\nCubs lineup:\n\n\nHere is tonight's #Cubs starting lineup at Wrigley Field. pic.twitter.com/N3GkKgUIWO— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nReds lineup: \n\n\nBack in the Windy City.Powered by @PNCBank pic.twitter.com/Ta7b5LOj6r— Cincinnati Reds (@Reds) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nAlso of interest for tonight and this series (time listed is ET):\n\n\nUmpires for #Reds (53-79) at #Cubs (56-78):Carlos Torres, Clint Vondrak, Jeremie Rehak, Chris Conroy (base assignments not confirmed until first pitch)First Pitch: 7:40 pmVenue: Wrigley Field(Updated)— Umpire Crew (@UmpCrew) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nWade Miley, LHP vs. Justin Dunn, RHP\n  \n        \n      USA TODAY NETWORK\n  \n\n  \n        \n      USA TODAY NETWORK\n  \n\nAs you can see by the graphic below, Wade Miley doesn’t throw really hard anymore. He makes up for that by having a wide pitch selection and throwing really good breaking balls. He also works quickly, which helps keep hitters off balance. I wish more pitchers would do that — they’ll have to next year with the pitch clock.\nMiley has not faced his former team, the Reds, this year. In fact, he hasn’t faced them since 2019, so most of the current Reds have not faced him. Albert Almora Jr. has a home run against Miley.\nJustin Dunn started against the Cubs August 14 in Cincinnati, and they hit him pretty hard (five runs in 3⅔ innings, including home runs by Patrick Wisdom, Yan Gomes and Christopher Morel).\nSince then Dunn’s pitched better — three starts, 2.40 ERA (but a 5.38 FIP!) but a lot of walks (six in 15 innings) and home runs (three in 15 innings).\nI think the Cubs will hit him hard again.\n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \nToday’s game is on Marquee Sports Network.

The chipmaker announced two new chips — the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 and the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 — that come bundled with AI enhancements and hardware to support 5G.\nThe Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 is the more powerful of the pair, with the ability to shoot pictures at up to 200 megapixels and HDR video capture. It also comes with “intuitive AI assistance” that can help suggest apps and settings based on your activity. Qualcomm says the SoC’s (system on a chip) CPU performs up to 40 percent better than the Snapdragon 695 it released last year, while its GPU performs up to 35 percent better.\nThe Snapdragon 4 Gen 1, on the other hand, seems less...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

Her actions make the question &#8216;Who appointed the judge?&#8217; a sadly relevant one in evaluating a judicial opinion.&#8221;\nDaily Beast: &#8220;Trump got the judge he wanted in the Mar-a-Lago case: One he appointed.

I don't think the appointment of a special master is going to hold up, but even if it does, I don't see it fundamentally changing the trajectory\" of the case, he added.\n\n\n\nBarr served as Trump's attorney general until December 2020. He resigned from the administration and has since caught the former president's ire after stating that there was no substantial evidence that the 2020 election was fraudulent. \n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, on Monday granted Trump's request for a special master to review documents and materials seized by the FBI in an early August search of the former president's Mar-a-Lago estate located in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\n\n\nTrump allies hailed the judge's order as a win.\n\n\n\nThe DOJ is investigating whether Trump violated the Espionage Act and two other statutes. More than 100 classified records were allegedly obtained from Mar-a-Lago, according to the department. Previously, the National Archives had recovered 15 boxes of documents from Trump in February. \n\n\n\nThe DOJ argued that a special master appointment was unnecessary because its filter team has already reviewed the materials.\n\n\n\nBarr on Tuesday said the DOJ could prosecute Trump over the case but doing so would deeply divide the nation.\n\n\n\n\"Even if they can technically make the case, there's another step, which is, prudentially, do they want to do it?\" he said. \"I hope they don't do it.\"\n\n\n\nTrump has decried the FBI's search of his Florida property as political and demanded the materials be returned to him, along with a special master to review them. Cannon declined to return the materials to him in Monday's order.\n\n\n\nBarr said Trump cannot use executive privilege as a former president to keep the materials and prevent the DOJ from reviewing them.\n\n\n\n\"Can the president bar DOJ from reviewing the documents?\" Barr said. \"The answer to that, I think, is clearly no.\"",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/3631185-biden-administration-awards-20m-contract-to-expand-monkeypox-response/",
        "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Tuesday announced it was awarding a nearly $20 million contract to AmerisourceBergen to expand the distributions of treatments and vaccines to respond to the ongoing monkeypox outbreak.\n\n\n\nThe $19.8 million contract to AmerisourceBergen, one of the largest drug distribution companies in the U.S., will allow for the shipment of up to 2,500 shipments of frozen Jynneos vaccine vials as well 2,500 \"ambient temperature\" shipments of the Tpoxx antiviral treatment per week.\n\n\n\nIt will also allow for more locations where the shipments can be received. HHS noted that before this contract, the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile was sending products to roughly five locations per jurisdiction.\n\n\n\nThroughout the monkeypox outbreak, state and local governments have repeatedly said they have struggled to acquire the adequate amount of vaccines to immunize their at-risk populations. Shortly after first doses of Jynneos were administered around the country, several cities ended up delaying the second dose in order to meet immediate demand while hoping more vaccine doses would soon become available.\n\n\n\n“Today’s announcement is the result of our real-time and ongoing conversations with states and jurisdictions aimed at improving the national response. This new commercial contract will help deliver vaccines and treatments to communities and at-risk individuals more quickly and bring us a step closer to ending the current outbreak,\" HHS Assistant Secretary Dawn O’Connell said in a statement.\n\n\n\nHHS said about 800,000 vials of Jynneos and 37,000 courses of Tpoxx have been distributed across the country so far. As of last week, more than 352,000 doses of vaccines to treat monkeypox have been administered. No deaths directly caused by monkeypox have been confirmed so far, though one man in Texas who was \"severely immunocompromised\" did recently die after having been diagnosed with monkeypox.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 18,000 monkeypox cases have been confirmed in the U.S. so far. The rate of new cases has begun to attenuate in the U.S. in recent weeks. White House officials previously said it is too soon to attribute this decline in cases to the vaccination campaign.\n\n\n\nInstead, this trend could be due to a change of sexual habits among men who have sex with men, the main demographic to be affected by the current outbreak. A CDC survey found that about half of men who have sex with men reported having fewer sexual partners and encounters due to the outbreak.",

        "description": "Photo By Winslow Townson/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Can he do it again? On August 27th Rich Hill took on the Tampa Bay Rays, was treated to an entirely right-handed lineup, and shut them down for seven innings in a remarkable win for the Red Sox. Rich Hill then lasted just four innings allowing 4 runs to the Texas Rangers. Which Hill we get tonight - 11 strikeouts, no runs or 4 runs, walks, and Ks - is yet to be seen. But Tampa Bay rolling the dice on all right-handed hitters is probably the smart call for them, statistically speaking.\nJT Chargois is playing the role of opener once more. A few weeks ago against Boston he went one inning allowing a hit, a walk, and striking out 1. On the season he’s tossed seven innings of 1.29 ERA/3.11 FIP ball. Drew Rasmussen being unavailable is a boon to the Red Sox, even if Tampa has options. With any luck whoever comes out of the ‘pen is an easier matchup than Rasmussen. \nJ.D. Martinez returns to the lineup today after a few days off for his ailing back.\nXander Bogaerts leads all American League hitters with a .317 batting average. \nTrevor Story is hitting .438/.455/.688 with 5 doubles and a home run since returning from the IL. Sure, it’s 33 plate appearances over eight games but along with his leaping catch the other day, this is the type of dynamic player the Sox wanted when he was signed.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/equilibrium-sustainability/3631319-equilibrium-sustainability-renewable-waste-pit-leaches-into-waterways/",
        "description": "A pit of hog waste in eastern North Carolina billed as a renewable energy solution leaked tens of thousands of gallons of toxic sludge into local waterways for months over the summer, the Raleigh News &amp; Observer reported. \n\n\n\nBut though that spill — which seems to have burst through the pit’s plastic lining — contained a toxic slurry of urine, feces and the decomposing bodies of hogs, state law allowed it to be kept quiet, according to the News &amp; Observer. \n\n\n\nWhite Oak Farms — a factory hog farm that was the source of the spill — had operated a side business running an anaerobic digester. \n\n\n\nThe digesters involve covering standard waste pits, or lagoons, beside factory farms. These generally contain millions of gallons of rotting animal waste, which releases the potent climate pollutant methane that the digester captures. \n\n\n\nSince methane is also the major component of natural gas, many local corporations — as well as states like North Carolina and California — have rolled methane from waste it into their power supply.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd the U.S. Department of Agriculture has heavily backed anaerobic digester as a means of capturing the potent climate pollutant.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn North Carolina, local conglomerate Dominion Energy has teamed up with pork giant Smithfield to begin selling the captured methane as fuel.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut critics say that the digesters don’t really fix the waste problem posed by the lagoons, which have repeatedly spilled into area waterways due to leaks or after floods, the News &amp; Observer reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen they do — as in this case — locals often may have no idea what’s gotten into their water, Jill Howell of the Pamlico-Tar riverkeeper Jill Howell told the News &amp; Observer. \n\n\n\n“There was no reference to what was in the wastewater foam, there was no acknowledgment that it was swine waste or dead hogs or food waste product,” Howell said. “It’s like a bare, bare bones public notice.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Equilibrium, a newsletter that tracks the growing global battle over the future of sustainability.

Then we’ll turn to Europe, where Russia’s Gazprom has indefinitely shuttered a major natural gas pipeline, and where Germany is backtracking on plans to end its nuclear power program.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Climate change strains California’s grid  \n\n\n\nA record heat wave is pushing California's electric grid up against the point of failure this week, with officials pointing to climate change for putting continued stress on the system.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEmergency alert: The state issued an emergency alert for a seventh consecutive day on Tuesday, urging customers to conserve energy between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"We have now entered the most intense phase of this heat wave,\" Elliot Mainzer, chief executive officer of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), a nonprofit that oversees grid operations, said at a Monday briefing.  Officials said the grid was expected to be as much as 4,000 megawatts short of demand by late afternoon on Tuesday. \n\n\n\nWhat’s going on? As temperatures in the state capital of Sacramento head toward 114 degrees, CAISO said Tuesday that demand could hit an all-time record of51,000 megawatts by 5:30 p.m.\n\n\n\nThe reason: Solar capacity begins to taper off with sunset while temperatures — and power demand for air conditioner use — remain high. To make matters worse, the older natural gas plants that provide power when demand is at its highest are less reliable in extreme heat, The Associated Press reported. \n\n\n\n“We are on razor thin margins,” Siva Gunda, vice chairman of the California Energy Commission, told the Sacramento Bee. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEETING THE MOMENT  \n\n\n\nCalifornia is attempting to meet demand by spinning up emergency natural gas generators — enough to power 120,000 homes, according to the state’s Department of Water Resources.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut those plants will provide just 120 megawatts — about 3 percent of the potential shortfall. That has the state calling on business and industry to cut power usage while asking households to raise thermostats and turn off large appliances in the evening.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConservation is working — sort of: Citizen attempts to cut electricity usage over the weekend helped cut power by 1,000 megawatts — enough to supply 750,000 households, Mainzer said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Your efforts have been making a real difference,” he continued.&nbsp;But with temperatures set to keep rising throughout the week, if ratepayers can’t close the gap by cutting demand, then “blackouts, rolling, rotating outages are a possibility,” Mainzer added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat’s a rolling blackout? In a rolling blackout, grid officials deal with power shortfalls by cycling outages among users. In California in August 2020, that meant outages ranging from 15 minutes to more than two hours.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBroader concerns:&nbsp;The state’s power crunch is one more sign of how climate change is straining the national grid and forcing even climate-forward states to depend even more on traditional energy sources.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nForestalling maintenance: The power issues also highlight the strain on infrastructure in general. California avoided blackouts this week in part by postponing maintenance on power plants between noon and 10 p.m. on Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported. That is a strategy that only works for so long.  \n\n\n\nPlease click here to read the full story. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia shutters gas pipeline with no signs of return\n\n\n\nRussia’s Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Europe will not resume pumping natural gas until Siemens Energy repairs defective equipment, a Gazprom executive told Reuters on Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese comments came after the Russian state-owned energy giant announced on Friday that the pipeline would remain closed because a turbine at a compressor station had an engine oil leak, according to Reuters.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn anticipated crisis: Gazprom halted gas flow through Nord Stream — a major supplier to Europe, via Germany —&nbsp; last Wednesday, initially declaring that it would be closed for several days of maintenance, as we reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe pipeline had already been operating at just 20 percent of its capacity, which Gazprom blamed on faulty equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The company had previously shuttered Nord Stream for 10 days in July — prompting concerns about whether Russia would restart flow this time at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPutting the onus on the West: “Problems in pumping arose because of the sanctions imposed against our country and against a number of companies by Western states, including Germany and the U.K.,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday, according to CNBC.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House disagrees: A White House official accused Russia on Monday of using energy as a weapon, adding that U.S. sanctions on Moscow do not prevent this supply route from operating, Reuters reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBlame game: When asked when Nord Stream would begin conveying gas to Germany again, Gazprom’s Deputy Chief Executive Vitaly Markelov pointed fingers at a German multinational energy corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“You should ask Siemens,” Markelov told Reuters on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp;“They have to repair equipment first,” he added.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nQuestioning the shutdown: While Siemens told Reuters that the company was on standby, the firm said that it was not commissioned by Gazprom to perform maintenance work, according to Reuters.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSiemens stressed that an engine oil leak at the least remaining turbine in operation at a compressor station in Portovaya, Russia, was not a reason to keep the pipeline closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site,\" a statement from Siemens said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEconomic escalation: Energy experts have come to see Russia’s decision as a bid to cause the region financial distress, CNBC reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnalysts at the New York-based Eurasia Group described Moscow’s move as “a further escalation of its policy” of inflicting pain \"through repeated supply cuts to Germany.”  Consultants at the Oslo-based Rystad Energy, meanwhile, noted that “the European energy sector continues to be shocked by price volatility.” The current shutdown, they added, has increased the chances “that Europe may not get further gas flows through Nord Stream 1 for the whole winter.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGERMANY BACKTRACKS ON PLANS TO END NUCLEAR \n\n\n\nWith future energy supplies in question, Germany decided on Monday to keep two of its three remaining nuclear power plants on standby, The New York Times reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe move delays Berlin’s plans to become the first industrial power to go nuclear-free.&nbsp;&nbsp;The power plants will remain operational as an emergency electricity reserve. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEnergy ‘stress tests’: Germany has already instituted a swath of conservation measures aimed at curbing its reliance on Russian gas, according to the Times.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the government’s decision to disregard “a political taboo” occurred after officials carried out “a series of stress tests playing out worst-case energy scenarios,” the Times reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPreparing for crisis: Economy and Energy Minister Robert Habeck, of the fiercely anti-nuclear Greens party, acknowledged that a combination of factors could cause severe strain on Europe’s grid this winter, according to The Associated Press.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We can’t rely securely on there being enough power plants available to stabilize the electricity network in the short term if there are grid shortages in our neighboring countries,” he said.&nbsp;If a harsh winter coincided with a shutdown of French power plants, for example, the result could be hourslong blackouts for millions of Germans.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe plants are still doomed: Habeck told the AP that Germany remains committed to eventually eliminating nuclear power nonetheless.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The nuclear plants won’t be equipped with new fuel rods,” he said. “There will be no decision to build new atomic power plants. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Virginia to field test electric school buses \n\n\n\nWest Virginia — a state best known for its coal industry — will preside over a new test of electric school buses.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThree Type D BEAST buses are being sent to the state this week by manufacturer GreenPower — one each for Kanawha, Cabell and Mercer counties — for field testing in rural conditions, the company announced on Tuesday.&nbsp;With this program West Virginia joins 38 additional states that have committed to their own electric school bus programs since January, according to the World Resources Institute.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPerfect site: West Virginia offers distinct advantages for a pilot program, according to GreenPower.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"West Virginia is a perfect location for the first true pilot project of all-electric, purpose-built, zero-emission school buses,\" company CEO Fraser Atkinson said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The terrain, weather conditions and the combination of rural and urban settings will give a real-life demonstration of the school buses' capabilities,” Atkinson added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe state Department of Education is overseeing the program.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLooking to the future: “Electric school buses like the ones utilized for this pilot program will soon be manufactured right here in West Virginia,” Cabell County superintendent Ryan Saxe said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“No one can do it better, and I cannot wait to see the multitude of benefits this investment will yield for the deserving people of the Mountain State,\" Saxe added. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday Troubles\n\n\n\nNuclear disaster still looms in Eastern Ukraine, Kim Kardashian “picks” private jets over climate compromise and beavers troubles yield to treaty.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUrgent need to prevent nuclear accident at Ukraine plant: watchdog&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency said there is an “urgent” need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant, in a new report published on Tuesday, covered by our colleague Rachel Frazin. The report specifically called for a cessation of gunfire adjacent to the plant, as well as the establishment of a protection zone around it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKim Kardashian: ‘You have to pick and choose’ on climate issues&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMedia personality and businesswoman Kim Kardashian — who was recently named one of the worst “celebrity [emissions] offenders” due to private jet use — told Interview Magazine on Tuesday that while she believes in climate change, she also supports “being realistic” about the issue. “I do what I can, but you have to pick and choose what really works for you in your life,” she said. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA water-trapping treaty with beavers&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfter generations of “war” against beavers, some Western farmers are beginning to embrace the social, dam-building rodents for their skill as hydraulic engineers trapping water in a parched countryside, The New York Times reported. “It’s all about identifying those locations where beavers’ survival interests align with humans’ survival interests, and they’re not always aligned,” river scientist Caroline Nash told the Times. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease visit The Hill’s Sustainability section online for the web version of this newsletter and more stories.

        "description": "Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes asked a federal judge on Tuesday to delay his Jan. 6 trial for at least 90 days, saying he terminated two of his attorneys after a “breakdown” in communication.\n\n\n\nRhodes is set to go on trial on Sept. 26 alongside other members of the group for seditious conspiracy and other charges related to their involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, but he argued the delay is necessary for his new lawyer to get acquainted with the case.\n\n\n\n“Rhodes has had a complete, or near-complete breakdown of communication between himself and his prior counselors,” Rhodes’s new attorney, Edward Tarpley, wrote in the filing.\n\n\n\nTarpley said Rhodes had not spoken on the phone with his previous attorneys since Aug. 10 and subsequently called them “repeatedly” with no answer. The two attorneys had not visited Rhodes in almost two months and missed filing deadlines, hindering Rhodes’s defense, Tarpley wrote.\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the two attorneys for comment.\n\n\n\nWith Tarpley now heading Rhodes’s case, he outlined 14 “necessary” motions that still needed to be filed for his defense.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWithout the delay to allow Tarpley to file the motions and further look into the case, he argued Rhodes’s Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights would be violated.\n\n\n\n“Stewart Rhodes is the prime defendant (of 9), in the most high profile, significant, complex and complicated case (with massive, potentially global, political implications), amid the entire array of 850-plus Jan. 6 defendants,” Tarpley wrote in the filing. “Yet Rhodes’ case has been fast-tracked onto a faster schedule than any other Jan. 6 case.”\n\n\n\nThe judge early last month denied a separate request to delay the defendants’ trial, dismissing their concerns that the House select committee investigating Jan. 6 could release a trove of transcripts from its interviews shortly before the trial.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe judge said the concerns were not sufficient but he would revisit the issue if transcripts were dropped on the “eve of the trial.”\n\n\n\nIn the new request for a delay, Tarpley said he will move to separate Rhodes’s case from that of the other defendants, noting that most of them were indicted months earlier than the Oath Keepers founder.\n\n\n\n“Codefendants have had almost a year more than Rhodes with which to prepare for trial,” Tarpley wrote. “Rhodes is not prepared for trial on September 26; and neither Rhodes’ prior counselors nor the attorneys for codefendants are prepared for trial.”\n\n\n\nTarpley also argued that last week’s arrest of Oath Keepers attorney Kellye SoRelle and other recent indictments mark a “monumental change” in how Rhodes expected to defend himself at trial.\n\n\n\n“These additional indictments effectively remove these important, key, defense witnesses from being able to provide material testimony in defense of Rhodes at Rhodes’ trial,” Tarpley argued.",

The organizations, he claimed, were “controlled by radical leftist scoundrels, lawyers and the media who tell them what to do … and when to do it.”\n\n\n\nAt the conclusion of his speech — which lasted almost two hours, incorporating brief remarks from Oz — Trump branded his many enemies “tyrants.” These unnamed foes, he added, “do not stand a chance.”\n\n\n\nSome will note that hot rhetoric from the former president is par the course. That’s true, to an extent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump’s inflammatory talk has drawn stark criticism since the speech that launched his first presidential bid, in which he talked about Mexico sending “rapists” across the southern border.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe then-candidate would later suggest a judge in a Trump-related case could not be trusted to deliver justice because of his Mexican heritage; call for a “complete shutdown” of Muslim immigration; and, most infamously of all, declared there were “very fine people on both sides” amid racist violence in Charlottesville, Va.\n\n\n\nIn office, Trump was reported to have referred to African and Caribbean nations as “shithole countries.” In the wake of unrest after the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020, Trump reworked a slogan associated with a reactionary Miami police chief of the 1960s: “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” And, in one of his presidential debates with Biden just before the 2020 election, he instructed the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat’s different now?\n\n\n\nFor one, the use of terms like “tyrants” seems to invite, if not demand, a quasi-revolutionary response from Trump’s most fervent supporters. The same goes for language about having to “smash the grip” of elites who are exerting sinister control over the citizenry.\n\n\n\nThe possibility of widespread political violence in the United States seems far more immediate now than it did even in 2015, when Trump began his first run for the presidency with his ride down the escalator of Trump Tower in New York.\n\n\n\nA new poll from CBS News and YouGov, released Monday, makes for ominous reading.\n\n\n\nAlmost two-thirds of the population — 64 percent — believe that political violence will increase in the years ahead, the poll found.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe figure has risen rapidly even in the relatively brief time since the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection — an event in which almost 150 law enforcement personnel were injured, and for which Trump became the only president in American history to be twice impeached.\n\n\n\nIn January 2021, 51 percent of Americans believed more violence was likely, CBS and YouGov found. That had risen to 57 percent by December before hitting its current high.\n\n\n\nThe new poll offered little hope of the spiral being broken.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt found that 49 percent of Republicans considered Democrats “enemies,” not merely part of a political opposition. Among Democrats, the figure was almost identical — 47 percent considered Republicans enemies.\n\n\n\nThe deep enmity is already leading to action.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigures as disparate as conservative Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Congressional Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) have seen people arrested outside their homes, allegedly intent on threatening their lives.\n\n\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Trump’s willingness to douse the flames with a bit more gasoline seems especially threatening.\n\n\n\n“It’s outrageous and it’s dangerous,” said Heidi Beirich, the co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.\n\n\n\nNoting threats against FBI agents in the wake of the raid on Trump’s Florida estate, Beirich said that the former president’s “willingness to demonize seems to know no bounds.”\n\n\n\nTrump’s fusillades against the FBI and DOJ complicate life for his fellow Republicans, accustomed to branding themselves as staunch supporters of law enforcement.\n\n\n\nHis remarks also, politically speaking, buttress Biden’s claims about an “extreme MAGA” strand of the current GOP — and, at least to some, justify the current president’s warnings about a rising tide of “semi-fascism.”\n\n\n\nBut Trump, as usual, shows no signs of lowering the temperature.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, he was insisting anew that the FBI and DOJ should “change the results of the 2020 presidential election.”\n\n\n\nThe DOJ and FBI, he added in another post, are “being pushed to do the wrong thing by many sinister and evil outside sources.”\n\n\n\nHe did not state what the appropriate remedy might be.\n\n\n\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage.",

        "description": "The Marlins activated outfielder Avisaíl García from the injured list today, per Jordan McPherson of the Miami Herald, after missing over a month due to a hamstring strain. Fellow outfielder Peyton Burdick was optioned in a corresponding move.\nIt&#8217;s been a disappointing season for García, the first of a four-year, $53MM deal he signed with with the Marlins. The Fish were surely hoping García could add some thump to their lineup after he hit 29 homers with the Brewers last year and slashed .262/.330/.490 for a wRC+ of 115. But he&#8217;s hit just seven long balls in 88 games this year, producing an overall line of .232/.269/.322, wRC+ of 68.\nThe Marlins are 17 1/2 games out of a playoff spot now and won&#8217;t be playing for much down the stretch. But García will look to get back into a groove and finish the season strong, going into the winter with some momentum and optimism for 2023.\nSome other injury notes from around the league&#8230;\n\nThe Athletics announced a series of roster moves today, one of which was placing righty Adam Oller on the 15-day injured list. Matt Kawahara of the San Francisco Chronicle relays that Oller&#8217;s IL placement is due to &#8220;right rib costochondritis.&#8221; The club hasn&#8217;t provided a timeline for the hurler, but he&#8217;ll miss at least the next couple of weeks. Since there&#8217;s only about four weeks remaining on the schedule, it&#8217;s possible that he&#8217;s done for the year. Acquired from the Mets in the Chris Bassitt trade, Oller made his MLB debut this year, tossing 73 1/3 innings with a 6.01 ERA, 13.4% strikeout rate, 11.2% walk rate and 31.7% ground ball rate.\nThe Rockies placed infielder José Iglesias on the 10-day injured list today due to a right hand contusion. Iglesias signed a one-year, $5MM deal with the Rockies in the offseason and became the first shortstop atop Colorado&#8217;s depth chart not named &#8220;Tulowitzki&#8221; or &#8220;Story&#8221; since 2006. He&#8217;s having another season typical of his career, providing solid defense while hitting a bit below league average. His batting line for the year is .300/.337/.392, producing a wRC+ of 92. Though that&#8217;s 8% below league average, his defensive contributions have allowed him to rack up 1.4 fWAR on the year. This offseason will feature another batch of superstar shortstops, including Dansby Swanson, Trea Turner, Carlos Correa and Xander Bogaerts, assuming those latter two opt out of their respective contracts. Iglesias isn&#8217;t quite at their level but will be in the next tier down, next to players like Elvis Andrus. With Iglesias out of the lineup the past three days, Alan Trejo has been slotted into the shortstop position.",

        "description": "Enlarge / Volkswagen won't reveal the US-spec ID Buzz for another year, but it invited us to drive the European version, which it has just launched. (credit: Jonathan Gitlin)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolkswagen provided flights from Washington, DC, to Copenhagen and back, plus two nights in a hotel so we could drive the ID Buzz. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.\nCOPENHAGEN, DENMARK—Few vehicles in the time we've been covering the industry have attracted—or sustained—quite the level of interest as Volkswagen's ID Buzz. Part realization of two decades' worth of concept cars and teases, part apology for dieselgate, it's an electric minivan with retro-cool styling, built on a solid electric vehicle platform. US-spec ID Buzzes are still some way off—we won't get the Buzz until 2024—but in the meantime, VW asked if we'd be interested in trying out the two-row, European-spec model, which is just about to go on sale the other side of the Atlantic.\nBoxy microbuses have been a part of the VW lineup since 1949's original Type 2, also known as a T1, Kombi, or Transporter. As time went on, the buses evolved to be more angular, and they eventually started to look like any other minivan. But as VW found with the Beetle concept in 1994, there's a lot of affection out there for its early designs.\nThe first retro-looking revival attempt was a 2001 concept called the Microbus. This was before people realized you could daisy-chain immense amounts of laptop batteries together to make a viable electric vehicle, so the 2001 Microbus concept would have been powered by VW's internal combustion engines—most commonly its ubiquitous and cheaty diesels, no doubt.Read 15 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge / Dave Grossman (L) and Ron Gilbert (R) joined Ars Technica for a rare interview in Seattle at PAX West 2022. (credit: Sam Machkovech)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEATTLE—Longtime game designer Ron Gilbert has repeatedly suggested that a sequel to his beloved Monkey Island series would arrive how fans want it: unspoiled. It's a major reason why the point-and-click adventure's pre-release period has been devoid of gameplay footage or other major giveaways of what to expect, lest any of its puzzles or jokes be ruined.\nAs the long-awaited Return to Monkey Island approaches its September 19 release date, then, interested fans will have to tide themselves over with the bones Gilbert and his collaborator Dave Grossman threw my way at this weekend's PAX West. After I entered their meeting room and sheathed my camera, the pair turned on an external display, picked up a computer mouse, and began goading hero Guybrush Threepwood around the new game's environs.\nYou might be jealous, but I would argue that your comparable ignorance about how the game looks and sounds is a happier place to be until September 19. My patience for this game's release has now dwindled.Read 34 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge / Dell's XPS 15 9520 is nearly identical to the last-gen 9510, albeit with improved processor performance. (credit: Andrew Cunningham)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven as an iterative update to an existing computer, Dell's XPS 15 9520 is pretty mild. It's super-iterative. The only thing that separates it from the XPS 15 9510 we reviewed last year is that it swaps the 11th-generation Intel processors for 12th-gen versions. Everything else, from the design to the screen to the GPU, is the same (unless you count changing the foreshortened Windows 10-era rectangle logo on the Windows key to a square Windows 11-era logo).\nSo we won't spend much time redescribing things about this laptop that we have already mentioned. Weighing just a bit over four pounds, this is still a computer made for people who want more power than a 13- or 14-inch laptop can provide, but who still care enough about size and weight that they don't want to graduate to a full-size desktop or a bulky gaming laptop.\nIt still has a nice slim-bezel screen, a huge trackpad, a comfortable keyboard with firm-but-not-too-firm keys and a pleasing amount of travel, and Thunderbolt and USB-C ports for accessories and charging (plus a single SD card reader and a headphone jack). A fingerprint reader, face-scanning Windows Hello-compatible IR camera, and a 720p webcam and speakers (serviceable-but-middling in both cases) round out the basic amenities.Read 12 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Three Pennsylvania Dunkin’ locations violated child labor laws by allowing teenagers to work longer and later than permitted, the Department of Labor said in a&nbsp;press release&nbsp;on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe Dunkin’ franchisee, Akshar Ashish LLC, paid a fine of more than $24,000 over the violations at its Hershey, Hummelstown and Palmyra locations, according to the Department of Labor.\n\n\n\n“Employers who choose to hire young workers have a legal responsibility to know and abide by the federal laws that govern their employment,” Alfonso Gristina, the department’s wage and hour district director in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., said in a statement. \n\n\n\nAt the three Dunkin’ locations, 14- and 15-years-olds worked more than three hours on a school day or eight hours on a non-school day, worked after 7 p.m. on a school night or 9 p.m. on summer break, and worked more than 18 hours during a school week — all actions that violate the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\n\n\nEmployers’ “obligations include ensuring minors only work during permitted hours, so employment does not interfere with their education, health and well-being,” Gristina added.\n\n\n\nAs part of its agreement with the Department of Labor, the franchisee will also conduct child labor training with its managers and supervisors, provide child labor publications, and use different colored name tags to help managers identify workers under the age of 16, according to the press release.\n\n\n\nSeveral fast-food chains have faced similar violations for overworking their teenage employees. Last week, nine Burger King restaurants in South Carolina were found to have violated child labor laws for allowing 14- and 15-year-olds to work beyond the permitted hours.\n\n\n\nA Chick-fil-A in Tampa paid more than $12,000 in fines for similar violations in August, while Jersey Mike’s paid more than $24,000 in June for violations at 10 locations in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Oregon.",

        "description": "Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) criticized the FX series “Little Demon” in a Facebook post on Monday, accusing the show of airing “satanic imagery.” \n\n\n\nJohnson said he was watching a college football game between Louisiana State University and Florida State University on Sunday with his 11-year-old child when a trailer for the show came on during the second quarter. He said he quickly grabbed the remote control to “shield” the child from the “dark” images of hell and demons and an explanation that the main character of the show is the Antichrist.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFX’s description of the show states, “13 years after being impregnated by Satan, a reluctant mother, Laura, and her Antichrist daughter, Chrissy, attempt to live an ordinary life in Delaware, but are constantly thwarted by monstrous forces, including Satan, who yearns for custody of his daughter's soul.” \n\n\n\nJohnson said the culture has become “alarmingly dark and desensitized, and this is not a game.” He said Disney and FX, which is owned by the former, have chosen to embrace and sell what is “clearly evil.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I could write volumes this morning, and unpack pages of Bible verses here, but instead I’m just going to state the obvious: Please be careful,” he said. “Our job as parents is to guard the hearts and minds of our kids.” \n\n\n\nJohnson said in a second post on Tuesday that his original Facebook post had reached more than 6 million people, more than the number who watched the college football game on Sunday. \n\n\n\n“Some of them are very unhappy, and that's okay,” he said. “Free speech is an important principle, and in this country, everyone can obviously make their own decisions about what media they and their families consume. But a corollary is that Christians have the freedom to fulfill our obligation to ‘speak the truth in love’ (Eph. 4:15), even—and sometimes most importantly—when it may not be popular.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFX did not immediately return a request from The Hill for comment.",

(DWAC) did not receive the necessary support from 65 percent of its shareholders to extend the proposed deal by 12 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDWAC said in a&nbsp;court filing&nbsp;last month that the success of the deal will depend on the “reputation and popularity” of Trump, who serves as the chairman of Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which owns Truth Social.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe filing set a special shareholder meeting on Tuesday to discuss extending the Thursday deadline to complete the merger by one year. DWAC will dissolve if the extension is not approved.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLOUDFLARE DROPS KIWI FARMS \n\n\n\nWeb security firm Cloudflare on Saturday dropped services for harassment website Kiwi Farms, citing an “threat to human life” posed by the social media platform’s users. \n\n\n\nFor the past few weeks, Cloudflare has faced calls from transgender rights activists to shut down the website, which they say gives a platform for users who are harassing, doxxing and threatening the LGBTQ+ community. \n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Matthew Prince, a co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare, defended the firm’s decision to continue defending controversial websites. \n\n\n\nHowever, on Sunday, Prince said in a blog post that visitors who navigate onto Kiwi Farms will now see a popup blocking access, with a link to his post. \n\n\n\nPrince said the website was hosting “revolting content” that escalated into “potential criminal acts and imminent threats to human life.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIRELAND FINES META\n\n\n\nAn Irish regulator has fined Meta, the parent company of Instagram, about$400 million because the social media platform broke data protection laws, specifically pertaining to children’s privacy on the app, multiple news outlets reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to Politico, which was the&nbsp;first to report the news, the Irish Data Protection Commission penalized Meta with a fine of 405 million euros, just over $400 million, a sum that the regulator confirmed to the news outlet.\n\n\n\nThe Data Protection Commission didn’t offer further details to Politico or to The New York Times, which also&nbsp;reported the news. But both outlets reported the fine was related to Meta violating the General Data Protection Regulation and how the data of children on the app is handled.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBITS &amp; PIECES\n\n\n\nAn op-ed to chew on: Who benefits from America’s enormously complex broadband infrastructure plans?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNotable links from around the web:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow China Has Added to Its Influence Over the iPhone (The New York Times / Tripp Mickle)&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe tech boomers are showing their age (Protocol / Joe Williams) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLighter click: Boppin' away on the Metro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🚀 One more thing: More delays for Artemis \n\n\n\nNASA directors said in a press conference on Saturday that they would postpone the launch of the Artemis I rocket until after the current launch period, which ends on Tuesday, after two scrubbed attempts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We will not be launching in this launch period. We are not where we wanted to be,”&nbsp;said&nbsp;Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems Development Jim Free.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe delay means that Artemis I will not be launched until at least the next launch period, which will occur in late September.

        "description": "Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) on Tuesday called President Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan excessive, arguing there are other ways to help people burdened by student debt.\n\n\n\n“I just thought that it was excessive. I just respectfully disagree on that,” Manchin told reporters.\n\n\n\n“I think there’s other ways. When people were calling me from back in West Virginia, I would give them all the options they had that would reduce their loan by going to work in the federal government,” he added.\n\n\n\nBiden’s plan, unveiled last month, forgives up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers making less than $125,000 annually and $20,000 in loans for Pell Grant recipients under the same income threshold.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if that amount was too much, Manchin said forgiveness should be earned.\n\n\n\n“I just thought there was a better way to do it. You have to earn it. You have to earn it,” he said.\n\n\n\nModerate Democrats, including those in swing districts, have raised concerns Biden's plan will add to the inflation rate that is already at a 40-year high and have criticized it for costing taxpayers.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile,&nbsp;progressive Democrats have hailed&nbsp;the move, calling it a real step toward helping the most needy deal with crippling college debt.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s plan also includes capping payments at 5 percent of borrowers’ monthly income and allows for current students with loans to be eligible for debt relief.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the president extended a freeze on federal student loan payments and interest accrual until Dec. 31.",

        "description": "MEMBERS&nbsp;of both parties are running full steam ahead to the November midterms following Labor Day, which marks the unofficial start of the final sprint to the election.\n\n\n\nExpect to see a lot more campaign ads on TV and even a polling call or two in the coming weeks as Democrats battle to retain their slim majorities in Congress.\n\n\n\nWhile Democrats have seen polling and several individual election models move their direction recently, they still face an uphill battle trying to thwart a House takeover.\n\n\n\nThe Hill's&nbsp;Max Greenwood&nbsp;has a great rundown of seven House&nbsp;races to watch, covering electoral contests playing out in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Connecticut, Virginia, Minnesota and Washington state.\n\n\n\nRepublicans are also locked in a fierce battle for control of the Senate, where each party currently holds 50 seats. The Hill's&nbsp;Mychael Schnell&nbsp;has the latest on the&nbsp;Senate races to watch&nbsp;heading into the final season of campaigning.\n\n\n\nControl of the Senate carries with it plenty of implications for&nbsp;President Biden's agenda and future nominations, while House Republicans are already vowing to investigate the administration if they retake the lower chamber.\n\n\n\nThe Hill's editor-in-chief Bob Cusack previewed on C-SPAN here what we can expect this fall from Congress.\n\n\n\nWelcome to&nbsp;NotedDC: Your guide to politics, policy &amp; people of consequence in D.C.\n\n\n\nIn today's issue: Lawmakers return to D.C., and why a judge's decision to allow for a special master in the Trump case matters. Plus: Mardi Gras comes early.\n\n\n\nBack to the Capitol\n\n\n\nMuch like their kids, members of Congress will be feeling the back-to-school blues as things start back up at the Capitol this week.\n\n\n\nThe Senate is back to business on vetting judicial appointments. Democratic leaders are coming off major wins, including passage of the party's health, climate and tax legislation.House committees are meeting while other members continue their district work periods; the House agenda will heat up more next week with the official return from the August break.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead:&nbsp;Democrats have been trying to plot a legislative path to codify abortion rights after the Supreme Court upended the landmark&nbsp;Roe v. Wade&nbsp;decision earlier this year. It’s unlikely the legislation will get the 60 votes needed for passage in the Senate, but it could prove to be a crucial wedge issue in the November elections.\n\n\n\nThe Senate is also weighing a vote on House-passed legislation to protect&nbsp;marriage equality. The House passed the bill in July, less than a month after Justice Clarence Thomas wrote an opinion calling for a reversal of several the landmark cases.&nbsp;Forty-seven Republicans&nbsp;joined Democrats in passing the bill in the House. Democrats would need to win over at least 10 Republicans to advance the bill in the Senate.\n\n\n\nLeading it all: The stop-gap funding measure that has kept government floating will run out soon as lawmakers try to avoid a government shutdown. Temporary spending bills often have become an avenue for other priorities to hitch a ride, with the often-rushed process making it harder to keep track of everything that's included.\n\n\n\n🔎 Special master: Five things to watch\n\n\n\nMonday’s court ruling requiring an independent review of documents seized last month from Mar-a-Lago is raising new legal questions about the reach of executive privilege while scrambling the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) investigation into former&nbsp;President Trump.\n\n\n\nThe decision passed down by Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge&nbsp;Aileen Cannon&nbsp;sets the stage for her to appoint an outside expert, known as a special master, to examine the thousands of documents recovered from Trump’s Florida residence after the DOJ’s extraordinary search operation on Aug. 8.\n\n\n\nHere are&nbsp;five things to watch&nbsp;as the process evolves, from The Hill's Rebecca Beitsch and Mike Lillis:\n\n\n\nThe ruling expects cooperation between Trump and DOJThe ruling impacts two different investigations&nbsp;&nbsp;A highly unusual decisionDOJ has to weigh appeal and whether to let ruling stand&nbsp;Rare win for Trump in a bad month&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nFox’s&nbsp;Peter Doocy&nbsp;asked White House press secretary&nbsp;Karine Jean-Pierre&nbsp;if she believes the 2016 election was “stolen.\"\n\n\n\nPresident Biden&nbsp;responded to a heckler: \"Everybody’s entitled to be an idiot.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer&nbsp;President Trump&nbsp;once tried to pay a&nbsp;lawyer with a horse, New York Times reporter David Enrich says in his new book. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nMehmet Oz, the celebrity physician and Trump-backed Republican Senate nominee in Pennsylvania, says he would have voted to certify Biden's win in the 2020 election had he been in office at the time.\n\n\n\n🎭 Celebrating Mardi Gras early\n\n\n\nLouisiana's lieutenant governor will be leading the launch of a new museum exhibit in Baton Rouge highlighting&nbsp;Washington&nbsp;Mardi Gras, the annual event held at the Washington Hilton hotel in northwest D.C.\n\n\n\n\"Carnival in the Nation’s Capital: The Washington Mardi Gras Ball\" will be hosted at the Capitol Park Museum in Baton Rouge. The exhibit will be launched on Oct. 18.The exhibit highlights a decades-old tradition in the nation's capital celebrated by displaced Louisianans. The hotel changes the lobby bar's name to the \"65th Parish\" to recognize the thousands of Louisiana VIPs and other visitors who make the trek to bring the party to the District. Here is how Louisiana Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser (R) describes it: “Begun in 1944 by homesick Louisianians eager to introduce fellow Washingtonians to their favorite holiday, Washington Mardi Gras has expanded to a three-day whirlwind of parties, brunches, dinners and networking, culminating in a formal ball under the auspices of the Mystick Krewe of Louisianians.” \n\n\n\nHave some news, juicy gossip, insight or other insider info?

        "description": "If the Orioles want to keep their postseason push alive, they need Kyle Bradish to bring his A-game tonight. | Photo by Carmen Mandato/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The O’s need rookie right-hander Kyle Bradish to play the stopper.  No, in the grand scheme of things, a three-game losing streak over a 162-game season is not a big deal. But dropping a winnable game against Oakland, then getting swept by Toronto in a Labor Day doubleheader felt like a big blow to the team’s momentum, and it couldn’t have come at a worse time. \nNow, with the playoff gap at 4.5 games between the Orioles and the Blue Jays, current holders of the third and final Wild Card spot, Baltimore will have to go on a run to get back into contention. \nAll year, what’s pushed the Birds into competitive territory has been pitching, and if they’re going to do it again, it’ll be pitching that does it. The good news is that Kyle Bradish, the talented rookie with the feisty fastball, nasty slider, and 12-6 hook, has been on fire since he returned on July 29 from the IL (shoulder inflammation). Pre-injury, Bradish had a 7.38 ERA with a .339 opposing average against. Post-injury, he’s pitched to a 2.71 mark and hitters are just .216 against him. \nIt’s a big turnaround, and the Orioles will need the good Bradish to please stand up if they want to keep their playoff chances alive. \nOn the hill for the Blue Jays is Mitch White, a onetime Dodgers prospect who came to Toronto just over a month ago to help stabilize the Blue Jays’ injury-ridden rotation. White was a swingman with LA (he made just 14 starts in 38 games) but Toronto has used him strictly as a starter. So far he’s 0-3 in that role with a 7.04 ERA and a 1.74 WHIP. I, for one, hope the Orioles keep up that trend tonight.  \nOrioles lineup\n1. Cedric Mullins CF2. Adley Rutschman C3. Anthony Santander RF4. Ryan Mountcastle 1B5. Ramón Urías 3B6.

        "description": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.Joe Biden’s “Soul of the Nation” address got at a cold and disquieting truth: The MAGA movement cannot be placated, reasoned with, or politically accommodated in any way. There is nothing its adherents want—and nothing anyone can give them—beyond chaos and political destruction.But first, here are three new stories from The Atlantic.\r\n\tBiden laid the trap. Trump walked into it.\r\n\tThe Mar-a-Lago document ruling is untethered to the law.\r\n\tWhat’s causing Black flight?\r\nSoul SicknessJoe Biden’s address to the American people last week was, as I wrote at the time, necessary and right. The staging was bizarre, and the speech had some of the hallmarks of a group product that hadn’t been subjected to a final spackle-and-smooth by a chief writer. But Biden got one big thing right, and that one thing explains why Donald Trump and the MAGA World apologists are reacting with such fury. The president outed them as anti-American nihilists:\r\nThey promote authoritarian leaders, and they fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country … MAGA Republicans have made their choice. They embrace anger. They thrive on chaos. They live not in the light of truth but in the shadow of lies.\r\nThis, as Biden pointed out, is what makes the MAGA movement so dangerous. It has no functional compass and no set of actual preferences beyond a generalized resentment, a basket of gripes and grudges against others who the Trumpists think are looking down upon them or living better lives than they are. It is a movement composed of people who are economically comfortable and middle-class, who enjoy a relatively high standard of living, and yet who seethe with a sense that they have been done dirt, screwed over, betrayed—and they are determined to get revenge.Biden broke with tradition by saying what presidents are never supposed to say: He admitted that he was finally giving up on trying to accommodate a group of Americans, because he understands that they do not want to be accommodated. I know that some of my friends and colleagues believe that Biden, as president, must continue to reach out to MAGA voters because they are our neighbors and our fellow citizens. (The former GOP operative and my fellow Never Trumper Tim Miller made this point just this morning.) My instinct is to agree with them. But how do we reach those voters? These citizens do not want a discussion or a compromise. They don’t even want to “win,” in any traditional political sense of that word. They want to vent anger over their lives—their personal problems, their haunted sense of inferiority, and their fears about social status—on other Americans, as vehemently as possible, even to the point of violence.How do any of us, and especially the president, engage with such a movement, when every discussion includes the belief that the only legitimate outcomes are ones in which the MAGA choice wins? Such an insistence is not civic or democratic in any way, and it is not amenable to resolution through the democratic process.This, by the way, is why it was a mistake for Biden to raise issues such as abortion and privacy in his speech. Yes, the opportunists who will ride into political office on the bed of a pickup flying MAGA flags will attack these rights, but that is incidental to their real interest, which is power and the spoils it brings. Issues such as abortion, LGBTQ rights, and contraception are really just hot buttons meant to rile up the voters. (MAGA World, as a movement, seems to have a kind of tabloid-television-style obsession with sex, which makes sense, as it is led by a tabloid star who literally bragged about the size of his penis on a GOP debate stage.)For Biden even to mention something like abortion undermined the more important part of his speech, which is that MAGA is a movement that doesn’t believe in anything but violence, chaos, and power. Right-wing pundits have seized on that part of his speech because it was the only thing they could argue with; they know that trying to describe MAGA and Trumpism with any consistency is pointless. Smaller government? More democracy? Power to “We the People”? Good luck with that: Trump just endorsed a GOP candidate for governor, Geoff Diehl in Massachusetts, by telling a crowd that Diehl will “rule your state with an iron fist, and he’ll do what has to be done.”As a native son of the Commonwealth, I have no concerns that the Bay State is going to elect someone on Donald Trump’s say-so. But Trump’s authoritarian blather makes Biden’s point. The MAGA movement isn’t interested in politics, or policies, or compromises. It is interested in destruction and seeing others made as miserable as its followers are. MAGA is a movement of people who seem to be, in so many ways, deeply and profoundly unhappy, and suffering from an emptiness and anger deep in their spirit. There is no political solution for that. All Joe Biden did was finally say this obvious truth out loud.Related:\r\n\tThe long unraveling of the Republican Party\r\n\tDon’t succumb to MAGA fatalism.\r\nToday’s News\r\n\tNewly declassified American intelligence reveals that Russia, hampered by sanctions, is buying artillery shells and rockets from North Korea.\r\n\tYesterday, Canadian police found the dead body of one of the suspects in Sunday’s mass stabbing spree on an Indigenous reserve in the province of Saskatchewan, in which 10 people were killed.

Wednesday in the middle of July, an 11-foot statue honoring Mary McLeod Bethune—carved out of marble extracted from the same Tuscan quarry that Michelangelo used for his David—stood draped in a black cloak in the U.S. Capitol’s National Statuary Hall. A group of distinguished guests had gathered to honor Bethune, the prominent educator and civil-rights activist who founded a college for Black students in Daytona Beach, Florida, and later served as an adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. She is now the first Black American to have a state statue in the hall.\r\n\r\nThe group, which included several members of Florida’s congressional delegation, smiled as cameras flashed. Two of those present, Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Val Demings, are opponents in the race for Rubio’s Senate seat—a race that could secure the Democrats’ control of the Senate.\r\nRead the full article.More From The Atlantic\r\n\tAmerica has a rabid-racoon problem.\r\n\tEven the Founders didn’t believe in originalism.\r\n\tLowering the cost of insulin could be deadly.\r\nCulture Break\r\nCharacters from Amazon's \"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.\" (Ben Rothstein / Prime Video)\r\nRead.

In a movie script that would be too off-the-wall even for Hollywood, a defense contractor named Leonard Francis, known affectionately to his clientele as “Fat Leonard,” plied Navy officers with money, sex, food, and booze in order to steer Navy business his way. Francis pled guilty in 2015 and was released from detention for health issues in 2018.This reality show has an epilogue: On Sunday, Francis cut his home-detention bracelet off his leg, and he is now on the lam. (I wish I could take credit for saying that “Fat Leonard is at large,” but my Atlantic colleague Nick Catucci thought of it first.) Amazingly, a guy with international connections at the center of a gigantic corruption case turned out to be a flight risk. More to come.P.P.S.I’ll add more reminders on this in the coming weeks, but The Atlantic will hold its annual festival September 21–23, which you can attend in person or virtually.

        "description": "Enlarge / Volkswagen won't reveal the US-spec ID Buzz for another year, but it invited us to drive the European version, which it has just launched. (credit: Jonathan Gitlin)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolkswagen provided flights from Washington, DC, to Copenhagen and back, plus two nights in a hotel so we could drive the ID Buzz. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.\nCOPENHAGEN, DENMARK—Few vehicles in the time we've been covering the industry have attracted—or sustained—quite the level of interest as Volkswagen's ID Buzz. Part realization of two decades' worth of concept cars and teases, part apology for dieselgate, it's an electric minivan with retro-cool styling, built on a solid electric vehicle platform. US-spec ID Buzzes are still some way off—we won't get the Buzz until 2024—but in the meantime, VW asked if we'd be interested in trying out the two-row, European-spec model, which is just about to go on sale the other side of the Atlantic.\nBoxy microbuses have been a part of the VW lineup since 1949's original Type 2, also known as a T1, Kombi, or Transporter. As time went on, the buses evolved to be more angular, and they eventually started to look like any other minivan. But as VW found with the Beetle concept in 1994, there's a lot of affection out there for its early designs.\nThe first retro-looking revival attempt was a 2001 concept called the Microbus. This was before people realized you could daisy-chain immense amounts of laptop batteries together to make a viable electric vehicle, so the 2001 Microbus concept would have been powered by VW's internal combustion engines—most commonly its ubiquitous and cheaty diesels, no doubt.Read 15 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Neither of us knew it at the time, but we were standing nearly shoulder-to-shoulder when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in August 1963. One of us had traveled up from North Carolina as a state youth coordinator for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The other was spending the summer as a Senate intern. And on that day, both of us, an African-American and a Jewish-American, ended up on the western edge of the Reflecting Pool in a very diverse and unified crowd of 25,000 people as Dr. King made one of the most resonant appeals in the nation’s history for social justice and equality.\n\n\n\nIn the decades that followed, as one of us rose through the ranks of the Civil Rights Movement to become executive director and CEO of the NAACP, among other positions, and the other through politics to become a U.S. senator, we both felt as though the nation was ascending toward Dr. King’s vision of national unity in a “beloved community.” Racism was still an ever-present reality in America. Anti-Semitism persisted as well. But for the better part of both our lives, from the height of the civil rights movement to the moment one of us was nominated for the vice presidency right through Barack Obama’s subsequent election as president, racism and anti-Semitism were in retreat in America. Aspiring leaders in both political parties embraced Dr. King’s dream.\n\n\n\nAs we stood there together in 1963 under the hot sun, the nation’s trajectory hardly felt inevitable. But the civil rights movement managed to weave a diverse community into a movement determined to tap into what President Lincoln once called “the better angels of our nature.” In the months and years that followed, our two American communities — Black and Jewish — worked closely together for justice and equality. Jewish leaders like Rabbi Abraham Heschel marched with Dr. King for Black equality. Blacks stood with Jews in support of Israel’s security and independence. And the love of the Bible and the history the two groups shared — Jews having emerged from slavery in Egypt, America’s Black community from slavery here at home — helped build a bond that has lasted for decades.\n\n\n\nThe triumphs of the civil rights movement remain cornerstones of our democracy, and the spirit of good feeling remains a bedrock of our society writ large, but something has changed more recently. In the wake of an ugly march of racists and anti-Semites in Charlottesville, Va., an American president said there were “good people on both sides.” A prominent member of the House suggested that, for Jews, “it’s all about the Benjamins.” As we both noted when reconnecting recently for our joint work with No Labels, a national organization devoted to achieving unity through bipartisanship, the longstanding belief that bigotry was a loser for any figure with political ambitions — that being viewed as racist or anti-Semitic would push any public figure to the margins and defeat — has been sadly upended.\n\n\n\nBut thankfully the events of the last decade have not driven a wedge between America’s Black and Jewish communities. Despite provocations from the fringes, the bond remains. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus are among Israel’s most important allies in Washington today. And the Jewish community has broadly embraced the cause of advancing Black equality and equity. Nevertheless, we believe this unique alliance will be better and more important than it is today — that Blacks and Jews today can be more influential together than apart. We hope that younger generations of leaders in both communities will learn from our history and begin to nurture the bonds that flourished generations ago, across racial and religious lines, despite different history, but within the beloved community’s Judeo-Christian tradition.\n\n\n\nJews should not be the only Americans concerned about anti-Semitism as it shows its ugly face again with greater frequency. Blacks shouldn’t be the only ones concerned about continuing racism in America. These two curses are born of the same poison, and will only be countered effectively if Blacks, Jews, and every other group of Americans who believe in freedom and justice come together to face them down. The great progress the civil rights movement made in the 1960s in part was a response to the terrible travails that defined the 1950s. We may be at a low ebb today—our collective American march toward equal justice may seem stalled and facing more opposition. But we can and must respond together in a movement bathed in shared American values that can realize our founders’ dream, and Dr. King’s, of a more perfect union.\n\n\n\nChavis and Lieberman are both co-chairs of the group No Labels.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3631508-scott-downplays-spat-with-mcconnell/",
        "description": "National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Rick Scott (Fla.) on Tuesday insisted he was not talking about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) when he lashed out at Republicans for “trash-talking” Senate GOP candidates.  \n\n\n\nScott wrote a scathing op-ed in the Washington Examiner on Sept. 1 in which he slammed GOP critics for questioning the quality of Senate candidates. The op-ed was published less than two weeks after McConnell said “candidate quality” could be a reason Republicans won’t capture control of the Senate in November.  \n\n\n\nBut on Tuesday, after meeting face to face with McConnell for the first time since the August recess, Scott said his op-ed was aimed at anonymous GOP sources quoted in media outlets and not at the Senate's top Republican.\n\n\n\n“I said people that do anonymous quotes to the liberal media. ...  People are doing anonymous quotes and trashing our Republican candidates,” he said. “It’s treasonous to the conservative cause.” \n\n\n\nAsked if he was making any reference to McConnell, Scott insisted, “No.”  \n\n\n\n“My op-ed said these people that are doing anonymous quotes that trash our candidates, that’s not helping, that’s hurting our candidates,” he said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nScott’s op-ed, however, appeared timed to respond to McConnell’s expressed concerns about the quality of Senate candidates. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Senate Republican leader told an audience in Florence, Ky., last month that he thought Republicans are more likely to win back the House than the Senate and cited “candidate quality” as highly important in Senate races.  \n\n\n\n“I think there’s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. Senate races are just different — they’re statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,” McConnell said in mid-August. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nScott declined to say whether he and McConnell had talked about how to resolve their public spat before meeting with the rest of the GOP leadership team in the Capitol on Tuesday afternoon.  \n\n\n\n“I don’t talk about any private conversations,” he told reporters. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut he said he and the GOP leader are unified in wanting to wrest control of the upper chamber away from Democrats.  \n\n\n\n“I think Leader McConnell and I are in the same position. We want to win the races,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nScott, however, told Politico in an interview published on Sept. 1 that he and McConnell “clearly have a strategic disagreement” over just how strong the Senate Republican candidates are heading into the fall.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Sen. McConnell and I clearly have a strategic disagreement here. ... We have great candidates,” he said last week. “He wants to do the same thing I want to do: I want to get a majority. And I think it’s important that we’re all cheerleaders for our candidates.”  ",

        "description": "Happy anniversary to one of the coolest moments in baseball history: 27 years ago today, Cal Ripken Jr. broke Lou Gehrig’s record for consecutive games played.  \n\n\n\nIn health news, the White House is planning COVID-19 boosters to be an annual event, like flu shots. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nWelcome to Overnight Health Care, where we’re following the latest moves on policy and news affecting your health. For The Hill, we’re Nathaniel Weixel and Joseph Choi. Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House: Public will need annual boosters\n\n\n\nTop White House health officials indicated Tuesday that the public is likely to need annual COVID-19 booster shots, making this year’s updated booster similar to an annual flu shot.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It is becoming increasingly clear that, looking forward with the COVID-19 pandemic, in the absence of a dramatically different variant, we likely are moving towards a path of vaccination cadence similar to that of the annual influenza vaccine, with annual updated COVID-19 shots matched to the currently circulating strains for most of the population,”&nbsp;Anthony Fauci,&nbsp;the country’s top infectious diseases doctor, said during a briefing.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSelling point: The messaging from the White House is an attempt to sell the public on the benefits of the variant-specific booster dose that was authorized last week.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBarring any \"variant curveballs,”&nbsp;White House coronavirus response coordinator Ashish Jha said he expects new boosters “will provide better protection against infection, better protection against transmission and ongoing and better protection against serious illness.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMixed signals? Administration officials say the new vaccines will be key to controlling a potential fall surge, but they will need to convince an increasingly checked-out public to get the shots. Demand for vaccines has waned with each subsequent booster campaign.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House is simultaneously projecting that COVID-19 is now a disease that is a part of everyday life while also urging people to be vaccinated. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeds stress need for new COVID funding \n\n\n\nThe boosters will be free, but there’s no money for much more.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhite House officials on Tuesday reiterated calls for new COVID-19 response funding to be approved by Congress as the fall vaccination campaign begins, with officials warning that there are currently not enough resources to respond should a new surge emerge.&nbsp;White House officials like COVID-19 response coordinator Ashish Jha and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra warned about the consequences of Congress failing to allocate more money.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Congress is aware that if we do not continue to fund the response, things … can easily go backwards,” Jha said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBecerra, however, remained vague on whether there are enough updated vaccine doses available for whoever wants one when asked about the lack of new funding. The White House previously warned that additional boosters and variant-specific vaccines&nbsp;would not be available&nbsp;for everyone if new funding was not approved by Congress.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe wells run dry: The White House cut funds from other areas of the COVID-19 response earlier this year in order to continually fund treatments and vaccines.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBecerra said the possibility of going into the fall and winter without vaccines for Americans was “unacceptable.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We will not have tests in our Strategic National Stockpile should we see another omicron like event,” Becerra said. “We had promised the American people we would make sure that we did not get into that, but we needed Congress to step up. Congress has not stepped up.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJUUL TO SETTLE YOUTH VAPING INVESTIGATION FOR $438 MILLION\n\n\n\nE-cigarette company Juul on Tuesday tentatively agreed to pay $438.5 million to settle an investigation by 34 states and territories into the company’s marketing and sales practices that were alleged to fuel the youth vaping crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe investigation found the company deliberately engaged in an advertising campaign that appealed to youth with launch parties, advertisements using young and trendy-looking models, social media posts, and free samples.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe settlement would severely limit Juul’s marketing and sales practices. It would prohibit Juul from marketing to youth and from funding education programs in schools. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nNobody under the age of 35 would be depicted in any of the company’s marketing materials, and the company would be prohibited from misrepresenting the level of nicotine in its products.\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW LONG COVID IS AFFECTING THE NATIONWIDE LABOR SHORTAGE \n\n\n\nPersistent COVID-19 symptoms could be keeping millions of Americans out of the workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEconomists and policymakers have struggled to figure out why a much lower percentage of working-age adults are in the labor force than before the pandemic.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe number of Americans either employed or looking for work eclipsed its pre-pandemic level in August, according to Labor Department data released Friday. But the labor force participation rate remains 1 percentage point below its February 2020 level, a gap roughly equivalent to 1.6 million people.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We don’t know what proportion of people are having very debilitating symptoms with a lot of certainty,” said Julia Raifman, an assistant professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health. &nbsp;“But we know that it is happening to some people and we know that each infection seems to increase the chances of it happening,” she continued. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRoughly 16 million working-age Americans said they had long COVID in a June survey conducted by the Census Bureau, but it’s unclear how many of them are still too sick to work. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden officials award $20M monkeypox contract \n\n\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Tuesday announced it was awarding a nearly $20 million contract to AmerisourceBergen to expand the distributions of treatments and vaccines to treat the ongoing monkeypox outbreak.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe $19.8 million contract to AmerisourceBergen, one of the largest drug distribution companies in the U.S., will allow for the shipment of up to2,500 shipments of frozen Jynneos vaccine vials as well 2,500 “ambient temperature” shipments of the TPOXX antiviral treatment per week.&nbsp;This will also allow for more locations where the shipments can be received. HHS noted that before this contract, the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile was sending products to roughly five locations per jurisdiction.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThroughout the monkeypox outbreak, state and local governments have repeatedly said they have struggled to acquire the adequate amount of vaccines to immunize their at-risk populations. Shortly after first doses of Jynneos were administered around the country, several cities ended up delaying the second dose in order to meet immediate demand while hoping more vaccine doses would soon become available. \n\n\n\nThe response by numbers: HHS said about 800,000 vials of Jynneos and 37,000 courses of TPOXX have been distributed across the country so far. As of last week, over 352,000 doses of vaccines to treat monkeypox have been administered.\n\n\n\nNo deaths directly caused by monkeypox have been confirmed so far, though one man in Texas who was “severely immunocompromised” recently died after having been diagnosed with monkeypox.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nPfizer isn’t sharing Covid vaccines with researchers for next-gen studies (Stat) In sprint to November, Democrats seize on shifting landscape over abortion (Washington Post) To mask, or not to mask: theaters and concert halls face a dilemma (New York Times) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATE BY STATE\n\n\n\nWhen does life begin?

        "description": "The U.S. assesses that Russia is purchasing rockets and artillery shells from North Korea in a bid to bolster its forces as Moscow’s war against Ukraine drags on.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe’ll break down the assessment. Plus, we’ll look at the warning from 13 top Pentagon officials about the threat of political polarization.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is Defense &amp; National Security, your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. For The Hill, I’m Jordan Williams. A friend forward this newsletter to you? Subscribe here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Korea selling military equipment to Russia\n\n\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense is purchasing millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea to bolster its forces in Moscow’s war in Ukraine, according to a U.S. official.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe official told The Hill that the assessment, which is based on downgradedU.S. intelligence, is a sign of Moscow suffering from “severe” military supply shortages driven in part by export controls and economic sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.S. anticipates Russia purchasing more North Korean military equipment in the future, the official said, without providing additional details on what type of equipment. The New York Times was first to report on intelligence suggesting Moscow was buying North Korean equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRussian-North Korean ties: Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to deepen relations with North Korea, which is isolated due to international sanctions over its nuclear program, following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.   \n\n\n\nThe United Nations currently bars Pyongyang from importing or exporting arms from or to other countries, meaning that the sale of rockets and artillery shells to Russia would violate that arms embargo.&nbsp;Ukraine, meanwhile, has relied on billions of dollars in equipment from the U.S. and other nations to supplement its own military as it fights back against the Russian onslaught.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWho else has Russia turned to? Russia has also turned to Iran to bolster its weapons stockpile. Biden administration officials said in late August that Tehran had transported its first shipment of Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series drones to Russia for use on the battlefield in Ukraine but cited information suggesting they have experienced mechanical failures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWord from the Pentagon: Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder confirmed the U.S. had “indications that Russia has approached North Korea to request ammunition.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I’m not able to provide any more detail than that at this point in time, but it does demonstrate and is indicative of the situation that Russia finds itself in, in terms of its logistics and sustainment capabilities as it relates to Ukraine,” he said during a Tuesday press briefing.&nbsp;“Certainly, as has been said, we assess that things are not going well on that front for Russia, the fact that they’re reaching out to North Korea is a sign that they’re having some challenges on the sustainment front.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the full story here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer leaders warn of political polarization\n\n\n\nThirteen former defense leaders on Tuesday warned that political polarization is straining the relationship between civilians and the military.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe open letter, signed by eight former Defense secretaries and five former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warns of an “an exceptionally challenging civil-military environment” exacerbated by geopolitical, social and political issues.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe signatories: The letter was signed by former Defense Secretaries James Mattis, Mark Esper, Ashton Carter, Robert Gates, Leon Panetta, Chuck Hagel, William Perry and William Cohen.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRetired Gens. Martin Dempsey, Joseph Dunford Jr., Peter Pace and Richard Myers signed as former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with retired Adm. Mike Mullen.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA quiet shot at Trump: The former secretaries, retired generals and retired admiral don’t mention a particular political party, but indirectly call out former President Trump’s resistance to the 2020 presidential election results and the transfer of power to now-President Biden.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Politically, military professionals confront an extremely adverse environment characterized by the divisiveness of affective polarization that culminated in the first election in over a century when the peaceful transfer of political power was disrupted and in doubt,” reads the letter, published on the national security website War on the Rocks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe military in partisan politics: The signatories note that “military officers swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution, not an oath of fealty to an individual or to an office” and that civilian control is shared by all three government branches.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There are significant limits on the public role of military personnel in partisan politics. … Members of the military accept limits on the public expression of their private views — limits that would be unconstitutional if imposed on other citizens. Military and civilian leaders must be diligent about keeping the military separate from partisan political activity.”&nbsp;The letter also affirms that elected civilians “have the right to be wrong … even if other voices warn in advance that the proposed action is a mistake” and that military officials must carry out legal orders even if they doubt the action.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the full story here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinuteman III test scheduled for Wednesday\n\n\n\nThe U.S. military will hold a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Wednesday, less than a month after the last such test, the Pentagon’s top spokesperson said Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAir Force Global Strike Command will hold an “operational test launch” of an unarmed Minuteman III ICBM in the early morning of Sept. 7 from Vandenberg Space Force Base, Calif., Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAbout Minuteman III: Minuteman III ICBMs are located in underground silos in five Western states and are tested several times a year. The missiles have a range of more than 6,000 miles and can travel up to 15,000 miles per hour.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe last test: The Minuteman III, which is capable of holding a nuclear payload, was last tested on Aug. 16 after being delayed for nearly two weeks due to increased tensions with China over Taiwan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRyder said that the launch is being held less than a month after the last such test due to the delay of the previous launch moving the dates closer together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year, test launches of the Minuteman III have been pushed back several times thanks to U.S. tensions with Russia over Moscow’s attack on Ukraine, as well as stresses between Washington and Beijing in relation to Taiwan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA ‘routine launch:’ “This launch is a routine test which was scheduled far in advance and consistent with previous tests. This ICBM launch will validate and verify effectiveness and readiness of the system,” Ryder said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe added that the United States has given the Russian government an advanced notice of the launch, in accordance with standard procedures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the full story here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nON TAP FOR TOMORROW\n\n\n\nThe 2022 Billington Cybersecurity Summit will begin 8:25 a.m. The Air &amp; Space Forces Association will host a fireside chat with Lt.

        "description": "The Giants announced they&#8217;ve designated catcher Andrew Knapp for assignment. The move clears a spot on the active roster for Joey Bart, who has been reinstated from the concussion injured list.\nIt&#8217;s the reversal of a move from a week ago, when Knapp was selected to the majors when Bart first went on the IL. He made three appearances with San Francisco, collecting a single and a pair of walks in seven trips to the plate. It was a decent showing in that exceptionally limited look, but Knapp has just a .128/.239/.154 line in 16 games between the Pirates, Mariners and Giants this season. The switch-hitting backstop owns a .209/.310/.313 mark through parts of six big league seasons &#8212; all of which came with the Phillies before he&#8217;s donned a number of uniforms this year.\nWhile he has not made a huge offensive impact as a big leaguer, Knapp has a solid track record in the minors. He&#8217;s a .261/.330/.426 hitter across 670 career plate appearances in Triple-A. A former second-round pick, he&#8217;s drawn a fair bit of interest this season as a depth option with clubs always on the hunt for experienced catching help.\nThe Giants will place Knapp on waivers in the next few days. If he goes unclaimed, he&#8217;d have the right to refuse an outright assignment and again set out to minor league free agency.",

Mitch McConnell (Ky.) as the next GOP leader in the upper chamber if he wins in November and the party gains the majority.\n\n\n\nDuring an appearance on Fox News’s “Special Report with Bret Baier,\" the host asked Oz if he will support McConnell as the next majority leader if Oz were to win in the Keystone State.\n\n\n\n\"I look forward to being in the United States Senate and [am] happy to make that decision for the next leader of the United States Senate ... it will be Republican,\" Oz replied to Baier. \n\n\n\n“But you can't make it tonight,” Baier pressed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Not going to make it tonight,” Oz said.\n\n\n\nMcConnell said last month that he has \"great confidence\" in Oz despite a slew of recent polls showing Oz trailing his opponent, Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D).\n\n\n\n“I have great confidence. I think Oz has a great shot at winning,” McConnell told reporters.\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to McConnell’s office for comment.\n\n\n\nFormer President Trump, who endorsed Oz, held a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday in an effort to boost the Senate candidate as well as GOP gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano. The former president used the occasion, his first public speech since the FBI’s raid at his Mar-a-Lago residence last month, to call out federal authorities and President Biden for a speech criticizing the MAGA wing of the party.\n\n\n\nOz also told Baier earlier in the program that Fetterman is “insulting” Pennsylvania voters by not disclosing his current medical condition. Fetterman, who has returned to the campaign trail after a lengthy absence following a stroke, is under pressure to participate in a televised debate with Oz. Fetterman said in a statement last week that he wouldn't participate in a slated early September debate against Oz.",

        "description": "We’ll dig into how long COVID intersects with the worker shortage. We’ll also look at President Biden’s semiconductor plan, school teacher strikes and the Labor Day air travel rebound.\n\n\n\nBut first, see why&nbsp;annual boosters&nbsp;might be on the way.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWelcome to On The Money, your nightly guide to everything affecting your bills, bank account and bottom line. For The Hill, we’re Sylvan Lane, Aris Folley and Karl Evers-Hillstrom. Subscribe here.\n\n\n\nHow long COVID is impacting the US labor shortage\n\n\n\nPersistent COVID-19 symptoms could be keeping millions of Americans out of the workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEconomists and policymakers have struggled to figure out why a much lower percentage of working-age adults are in the labor force than before the pandemic.\n\n\n\nThe number of Americans either employed or looking for work eclipsed its pre-pandemic level in August, according to Labor Department data released Friday.But the labor force participation rate remains 1 percentage point below its February 2020 level, a gap roughly equivalent to 1.6 million people.\n\n\n\nA smaller labor force hasn’t kept the U.S. from adding jobs at a rapid rate since mid-2020. Even so, thousands — if not millions — of Americans could be on the sidelines of the rapid recovery because they’re still too sick from prolonged COVID-19 symptoms to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We don’t know what proportion of people are having very debilitating symptoms with a lot of certainty,” said Julia Raifman, an assistant professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“But we know that it is happening to some people and we know that each infection seems to increase the chances of it happening,” she continued.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSylvan has more here.\n\n\n\nCHIPS ON THE TABLE \n\n\n\nBiden administration unveils plan for bolstering semiconductor production&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration on Monday unveiled its plan for bolstering domestic chip production in the U.S. by using the $50 billion in funding from the CHIPS and Science Act passed this summer.\n\n\n\nThe administration will use the majority of the funding, around $28 billion, to establish domestic production of leading edge logic and memory chips through grants, subsidized loans or loan guarantees, the Department of Commerce said in an announcement.The administration will use around $10 billion to increase production of current-generation semiconductors and chips. An additional $11 billion will be invested in research and development.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Rebecca Klar has the latest. \n\n\n\nSCHOOL’S OUT\n\n\n\nSeattle teachers union authorizes strike, potentially delaying school year start&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnionized educators at Seattle Public Schools (SPS) on Tuesday voted to authorize a strike, which threatens to delay the start of the school year on Wednesday if a contract agreement is not reached.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Seattle Education Association (SEA) announced on Tuesday afternoon that 95 percent of voters authorized the strike, with three-quarters of its roughly 6,000 members participating.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnion leaders said they are continuing to bargain with the school district throughout the day, but they may begin picketing on Wednesday morning if no agreement is reached.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Zach Schonfeld breaks it down. \n\n\n\nFLIGHT FRENZY\n\n\n\nLabor Day marked first holiday weekend to exceed pre-pandemic air travel levels, TSA says&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNearly 9 million people passed through the nation’s airports during the Labor Day weekend, the first holiday weekend to surpass pre-pandemic air travel levels, according to Transportation Security Administration (TSA) data.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe agency announced on Tuesday that it screened 8.76 million passengers between Friday and Monday, which was 102 percent of the Labor Day weekend passenger volume in 2019.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“TSA’s highly trained and dedicated workforce facilitated secure travel for millions of passengers during the busy summer travel season with very little disruptions at the checkpoint,” TSA acting Administrator David Pekoske said in a statement.\n\n\n\n“We were also able to continue the deployment of new technologies that facilitate stronger identity verification procedures and enhanced security screening for carry-on bags.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere’s more from Zach.\n\n\n\nGood to Know\n\n\n\nNow that the term “quiet quitting” has buzzed around the Internet, a new phrase — “quiet firing” — is&nbsp;shifting the focus around workplace culture&nbsp;on to how employers treat their staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s not an unusual tactic, as more than 80 percent of respondents say they have either seen or experienced quiet firing, according to a recent LinkedIn News poll.   \n\n\n\nThat’s it for today.

        "description": "Advocates are linking the water crisis in Jackson, Miss., to environmental racism. Meanwhile, California is facing electric grid issues amid extreme heat, and a judge sided with the Biden administration over a challenge to oil lease sale postponements in Wyoming.\n\n\n\nThis is Overnight Energy &amp; Environment, your source for the latest news focused on energy, the environment and beyond. For The Hill, we’re Rachel Frazin and Zack Budryk. Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates see justice issue in Jackson water crisis\n\n\n\nAs tens of thousands of residents of Jackson, Miss., were without clean water, some advocates say the situation stems from years of environmental racism.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore than 80 percent of Jackson residents are Black, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Last week, those residents saw their main water treatment facility fail in the wake of flooding, leaving them without clean water for drinking, bathing or cooking. \n\n\n\n“While the recent flooding has been a contributor to where we are today, this is not the first time this issue has come about, where the city of Jackson is without water and unable to function,” Vangela Wade, president and CEO of the Mississippi Center for Justice, told The Hill. “Over the last 50 years, you could say that this has been brewing because of the lack of investment in the city’s infrastructure by primarily state leadership.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe latest water issues come after the last two years saw the city’s water system fail an Environmental Protection Agency inspection — which found the drinking water had the potential to host harmful bacteria or parasites — and the bursting and freezing of pipes during a winter storm last year left residents without water for nearly a month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut advocates say the crisis has been decades in the making. Jackson first became a majority-Black city in the years following integration. The white population fell from52 percent to 43 percent through the 1980s, with another 35,000 leaving the city over the course of the 1990s, according to The Jackson Free Press.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis population loss has reduced the city’s tax base and left it with far less money for basic resources.&nbsp;While the city tried to fight the new loss of water by handing out free bottled water to residents, they quickly ran out. Now, some of that responsibility has fallen to local community organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor years, the anti-violence prevention program Operation Good has been delivering water to residents across the city. Gino, who is the founder of the organization and asked not to have his last name published, said his group began handing out water back in 2015.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is nothing new for us,” said Gino, adding that the group prioritizes taking care of the elderly and disabled first, following up with children and those living in poverty. More recently, he added, they’ve been bringing water pallets to different schools that contacted Operation Good in desperate need of providing for their students.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDifference in circumstances: Gino said he doesn’t normally use terms like “environmental racism” but added he knows “surrounding cities that are majority white that don’t have infrastructure problems like Jackson.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Jackson’s infrastructure problems are horrendous,” he said. “For us to be the capital city of the state of Mississippi, it does not receive the attention, financing and things of that nature that it should.”&nbsp;&nbsp;Gino said children in the city are exposed to raw sewage so often, they’ve become immune to it: it’s in their bathing water, it’s in their cooking water, it’s in their drinking water. And through it all, residents have still received water bills.&nbsp;“It always felt like it was a ‘Jackson problem,’ not a Mississippi problem,” Gino said. “It was a Black-people problem, not a majority-of-the-state problem.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about the issue here, from Zack and The Hill’s Cheyanne M. Daniels. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeat strains California’s power grid  \n\n\n\nA record heat wave is pushing California’s electric grid up against the point of failure this week, with officials pointing to climate change for putting continued stress on the system.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe state issued an emergency alert for a seventh consecutive day on Tuesday, urging customers to conserve energy between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We have now entered the most intense phase of this heat wave,” Elliot Mainzer, chief executive officer of California’s principal electric grid, California ISO, said in a briefing on Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs temperatures in the state capital of Sacramento head toward 114 degrees, California ISO said Tuesday that demand could hit an all-time record of51,000 megawatts by 5:30 p.m., as solar capacity begins to taper off with sunset while temperatures — and power demand for air conditioner use — remain high.&nbsp;Officials said the grid was expected to be as much as 4,000 megawatts short of demand by late afternoon on Monday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo make matters worse, the older natural gas plants that provide additional power when demand is at its highest&nbsp;are less reliable in extreme heat, The Associated Press reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We are on&nbsp;razor thin margins,”&nbsp;Siva Gunda, vice chairman of the California Energy Commission, told the Sacramento Bee.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCalifornia is attempting to meet demand&nbsp;by spinning up&nbsp;emergency natural gas generators&nbsp;— enough to power 120,000 homes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut those plants will provide just 120 megawatts — about 3 percent of the potential shortfall. That has the state calling on business and industry to cut power usage while asking households to raise thermostats and turn off large appliances in the evening.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCitizen attempts to cut electricity usage over the weekend helped cut power by1,000 megawatts — enough to supply 750,000 households, Mainzer said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Your efforts have been making a real difference,” he said.&nbsp;But with temperatures set to keep rising throughout the week, if consumers can’t close the gap by cutting demand, then “blackouts, rolling, rotating outages are a possibility,” Mainzer added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a rolling blackout, grid officials deal with power shortfalls by cycling outages among users. In California in August 2020, that meant outages&nbsp;ranging&nbsp;from 15 minutes to more than two hours.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here from The Hill’s Saul Elbein. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWATCHDOG DETAILS ‘URGENT’ NEED TO PREVENT NUCLEAR ACCIDENT \n\n\n\nA global nuclear watchdog said Tuesday that there is an “urgent” need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident related to shelling near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a report released on Tuesday, specifically called for an end to gunfire near the power plant and the establishment of a protection zone around it.  \n\n\n\n“Pending the end of the conflict and re-establishment of stable conditions there is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means,” the IAEA report said. &nbsp;“This can be achieved by the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone,” the agency continued. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe IAEA noted in the report that some damage had already been caused to parts of the plant, and that ongoing shelling could have worse consequences, including the “unlimited release of radioactive materials to the environment.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe risk: Exposure to very high levels of radiation can cause skin burns, nausea, vomiting and sometimes death in the short term. In the long term, it can cause cancer and cardiovascular disease. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about the warning here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge sides with Biden in oil lease pause ruling \n\n\n\nA federal judge sided with the Biden administration in a case related to its oil and gas leasing pause in Wyoming.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, because of another case, the government still appears to be barred from continuing its leasing pause in several other states.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt the start of his tenure, President Biden temporarily paused new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters. This pause prevented new rights to drill for the fuels on federal lands from being auctioned off. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ruling: U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl, an Obama appointee, ruled Friday that the Biden administration was within its rights to postpone lease sales in Wyoming during the first quarter of 2021. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe wrote that there was “substantial evidence” to support the Interior Department’s move to put off lease sales that had been slated for March 2021 over concerns about the adequacy of their underlying environmental reviews. &nbsp;Wyoming filed its suit after the March lease sales were postponed, but before other postponements. Skavdahl also ruled that Wyoming did not have the right to challenge any postponements that occurred after its suit was filed. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever: In most states, the Biden administration still appears to be barred from pausing new oil and gas leasing. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nLast month, Trump appointee District Judge Terry Doughty ruled in favor of 13 states that had challenged the oil and gas leasing pause. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n&nbsp;He determined that the law requires the government to sell oil and gas leases, and therefore, the Biden administration must auction more acres for drilling.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the story here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'DOOMSDAY GLACIER’ HANGING ON ‘BY ITS FINGERNAILS’ \n\n\n\nA glacier that could cause a multi-foot sea level increase if it melted is disappearing at about twice the previously observed rate, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlthough the findings indicate the rate of retreat has slowed in recent years, researchers also saw indications that past a certain point the recession could begin increasing rapidly again.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Thwaites is really holding on today by its fingernails, and we should expect to see big changes over small timescales in the future — even from one year to the next — once the glacier retreats beyond a shallow ridge in its bed,” co-author Robert Larter of the British Antarctic Survey said in a statement.&nbsp; &nbsp;“Just a small kick to Thwaites could lead to a big response,” added Graham. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nResearchers, led by Alistair Graham of the University of South Florida, analyzed historical data on the retreat of the Thwaites Glacier, which is about the size of Florida and considered among the most vulnerable parts of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. They found that during a five-month period in the previous two centuries, the glacier receded at an annual rate of about 1.3 miles — twice the rate observed over the 2010s. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother day on the doomsday beat: The Thwaites Glacier is also known as the “Doomsday Glacier” for the sea level rise its melt could cause — just over two feet. It is at particular risk due to its position on the ocean floor rather than land, making it vulnerable to warming ocean currents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about the issue here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nAs water levels drop in California’s Lake Isabella, a Wild West ghost town re-emerges (SFGate) Russian Gas Cut-Off Scuppers German Plan to Bolster Reserves (Bloomberg) GAO: Trump team bogged down sensitive Interior grants(E&amp;E News) Democrats push White House to strengthen environmental justice efforts (The Washington Post) OPEC agrees to cut production after oil price slump (CNN) \n\n\n\nICYMI\n\n\n\nArizona Democrat says California ‘failing to do its part’ on Colorado River crisis Mississippi Gov. on Jackson water crisis: ‘Privatization is on the table’ Tim Ryan backing Manchin plan for expediting energy permits \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🌽 Lighter click: It's corn!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it for today, thanks for reading.

Masha Gessen, in contrast, knows a lot, and this piece by her in the New Yorker explores some interesting conspiracy theories about whodunnit.\n\nDarya Dugina, a twenty-nine-year-old Russian television commentator, was laid to rest at an undisclosed location in Moscow on August 23rd. Three days earlier, Dugina had attended a festival called Tradition, a daylong event that, this year, included a lecture by her father, the self-styled political philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, on the metaphysical dualism of historical thinking. The gathering concluded with a concert called “The Russian Cosmos.” Afterward, Darya Dugina drove away in a Toyota Land Cruiser. The car exploded, killing her. Aleksandr Dugin was apparently travelling in a different vehicle, and it seems likely that whoever killed Darya had meant to kill her better-known father. There has since been much speculation about the identity and motives of the killers, but little is known for certain. Still, some theories are better than others.\nWestern media accounts have portrayed Dugin as a sort of Putin whisperer, the brains behind the Kremlin’s ideology. He is not that, but his story tells a lot about recent Russian history and the current state of Russian society…\n\n\nChart of the Day\nCalifornia roasting\n\nJust a local manifestation of a cooking planet. No consolation to those without air-conditioning, though.\nSource\n\nSauce for the goose&#8230;\nBig news in the tech world in the last few days was the revelation that Nvidia, the outfit that makes the high-end processing chips that power a lot of AI (aka machine-learning) systems, has been barred from selling them to China.\nThe Chinese were incandescent about this step by the US. The Wall Street Journal reported its Ministry of Commerce declaring that &#8220;the U.S. move would damage the interests of both Chinese and American companies. The U.S. should treat enterprises of all countries fairly&#8221;.\nThis prompted a splendid rant from Ben Thompson, whose wonderful Stratchery newsletter is one of my daily treats.\n\nChina complaining that the U.S. should treat enterprises of all countries fairly is, while not surprising, one of the most absurd statements I have ever seen. Tech is the most obvious example: U.S. Internet companies have been blocked from China for going on a generation now, even as Chinese-owned companies like TikTok are allowed to take massive chunks out of the valuation and competitive position of U.S. companies like Meta. This is, to be sure, only the tip of the spear: I could talk about forced joint ventures in China that are glorified IP theft, a systemic refusal to abide by obligations under China’s WTO membership like equal access for banks and payment companies, or the fact that Chinese companies get to raise money in the U.S. with little or no oversight. But I’ll just stick to tech: China blatantly discriminates against U.S. companies, and even if you want to make the case this is smart — there is a case to be made! — it is, and always will be, infuriating to read cynical statements like this.\n\nHe also makes the point that, from a geopolitical standpoint, it makes strategic sense for the US to keep China from benefiting from its advanced technology because it provides an incentive for Xi Jinping &amp; Co to play nice over Taiwan. While I have little sympathy for American hegemonic anxiety, I have no desire to live in a world dominated by the kind of regime now oppressing the Uighurs either.\n\nMy commonplace booklet\nYou are invite to visit our restaurant where you can eat the Middle East foods in an European ambulance”.\n\nHotel Notice, Ankara\n\n(From French Widow in Every Room)\n\n  This Blog is also available as a daily email.

        "description": "Photo by Norm Hall/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Merrill Kelly hasn’t lost since June. It’s not even the current longest streak without defeat in Arizona.  \n\nToday's Lineups\n\n\n\n\nDIAMONDBACKS\nPADRES\n\n\n\n\nJosh Rojas - 3B\nJurickson Profar - LF\n\n\nDaulton Varsho - RF\nJuan Soto - RF\n\n\nKetel Marte - 2B\nManny Machado - 3B\n\n\nChristian Walker - 1B\nJosh Bell - DH\n\n\nJake McCarthy - LF\nJake Cronenworth - 2B\n\n\nCorbin Carroll - DH\nHa-Seong Kim - SS\n\n\nCarson Kelly - C\nWil Myers - 1B\n\n\nAlek Thomas - CF\nTrent Grisham - CF\n\n\nSergio Alcantara - SS\nJorge Alfaro - C\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerrill Kelly - RHP\nJoe Musgrove - RHP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong currently active starting pitchers, the Diamondbacks currently have two of the three longest streaks without a loss: Merrill Kelly has gone 12 starts and Zac Gallen 15. They both trail only Joe Kelly, and he only technically qualifies, having started for the White Sox on Friday night, going one inning. Still, Joe has not lost a game as a starter in more than seven years, having last been defeated on July 22, 2015 as a member of the Red Sox. Since then, Kelly has made 18 starts and gone 10-0. The only other live streaks of more than 11 games by active pitchers belong to a trio who did it while openers for Tampa, e.g. Ryne Stanek reached 19, though he is now in the Astros’ pen and unlikely to start. \nIt’s also worth noting that both Kelly and Gallen are on course to have ERAs below three, sitting at 2.84 and 2.42 respectively. If sustained over the final month of the season, it’ll be the first time since 2003 that the D-backs have had a pair of qualifying pitchers post ERAs that start with a two. Then it was Curt Schilling (2.95) and Brandon Webb (2.84). The only other occasion was, of course, in 2001 when it was Schilling (2.98) and Randy Johnson (2.49). Did anyone think at the start of the season that we’d be speaking about Merrill and Zac in the same conversation as those Cy Young winners and runners-up? Bringing those two men to Arizona may be the best moves Mike Hazen has made to date. \nBoth are on pace for a value somewhere round 5.8 bWAR. If that is achieved by either, it will be the best for an Arizona pitcher in over a decade, since Dan Haren reached 6.5 bWAR in 2009. The only time we’ve had a pair that cailbre was 2001-2003, with the trio noted above. In 2003, the value was comparable (Schilling/Webb = 6.0/6.1). But the insane workload of Schilling and Johnson the previous two seasons, (averaging over 250+ innings per man), helped lead to a 1-2 punch we may never see again. In 2002, the pair combined for 19.3 bWAR, and 18.9 bWAR the previous year. Gallen and Kelly could be around 11-12 between them, among the best in the majors. That’s just how damn good Curt and Randy were.",

        "description": "The new COVID boosters rolling out this month represent a shift in strategy, said White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha during a press briefing. The goal now will likely be to roll out new boosters annually.Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesThe U.S. has reached an important milestone in the pandemic, according to federal health officials.Going forward, COVID-19 could be treated more like the flu, with one annual shot offering year-long protection against severe illness for most people.&quot;Barring any new variant curve balls, for a large majority of Americans we are moving to a point where a single, annual COVID shot should provide a high degree of protection against serious illness all year,&quot; said White House COVID response coordinator Ashish Jha at a press briefing Tuesday.The federal government has started rolling out a new round of boosters for the fall — they are updated versions of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines targeting both the original coronavirus and the two omicron subvariants that are currently causing most infections. These vaccines could be tweaked again if new variants become dominant in the future, which is how the flu shot works. Every fall, people get a new flu vaccine designed to protect against whatever strains of the virus are likely to be circulating that season. The hope is the COVID boosters will act the same way.Jha cautioned that older people and those with health problems that make them more vulnerable to severe disease may need to get boosted more often. But for most people Jha hopes this latest booster will be the last shot they need for at least another year.Throughout the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has been incredibly unpredictable and has been evolving much faster than anyone expected, so officials say they will continue to monitor the virus closely and they are ready to reprogram the vaccines again if necessary.&quot;You&#x27;ve got to put the wild card of a way-out-of-left-field variant coming in,&quot; said White House adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, at the briefing. If that happens he says the recommendations may change. But, &quot;if we continue to have an evolution sort of drifting along the BA.5 sublineage,&quot; he says the annual shot should be able to cover whatever is out there as the dominant variant.But there is still a lot of debate about just how much of an upgrade the new boosters will really be.  Some infectious disease experts are not convinced the updated vaccines will be a game-changer, because they haven&#x27;t been tested enough to see how well they work.&quot;I think the risk here is that we are putting all our eggs in one basket,&quot; Dr. Celine Gounder, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told NPR. &quot;We&#x27;re only focusing on boosting with vaccines. I think the issue is people are looking for a silver bullet. And boosters are not a silver bullet to COVID.&quot;Federal officials are concerned that a low number of people will sign up for the new boosters, following a low demand for the initial booster shots. According to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention only 34% of people over 50 have gotten their second booster.So, as we head into the winter, the administration is urging everyone age 12 and older to get boosted right away to help protect themselves and the more vulnerable people around them. People have to wait at least two months since their last shot and should wait at least three months since their last infection.  People have to wait at least 2 months since the last shot and should wait at least three months since their last infections. But they can sign up to get a COVID booster at the same time as a flu shot. Because Congress has balked at providing addition funding to fight the pandemic, the new boosters are likely to be the last COVID shots provided for free. People who have insurance will get them covered through their policies. The administration says it&#x27;s working to make sure those who are uninsured have access to future COVID-19 vaccinations.

        "description": "Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n    \n\n  After suffering a tough loss on Monday, the Colorado Rockies will attempt to get a win back against the visiting Milwaukee Brewers on Tuesday evening. \nBrandwon Woodruff (9-4, 3.54 ERA) recently had a tough outing against a different National League West team. The 29-year-old right-hander allowed eight hits and five runs in the 5-0 loss to the Diamondbacks, a performance the Rockies will try to replicate. \nThat task will likely be made easier by way of Woodruff pitching away from the friendly confines of Miller Pa American Family Field - indeed, his 4.67 road ERA is far higher than his 2.22 home number. Woodruff has also had a rough go against the Rox through his career, as shown by his 23 hits allowed in 18 2⁄3 innings to the tune of a 6.75 ERA. His last attempt, in July of this year, was a quality start and by far the best outing of his career versus Colorado.\nChad Kuhl (6-8, 5.19 ERA) is making his third start since his return from injury. The storyline surrounding the righty continues to be that he has not thrown a quality start since his masterful shutout performance against the Dodgers, a streak lasting eight outings in a row. \nWe’ll see if that changes on Tuesday as Kuhl matches up against a team that forced him from the game before the completion of the third inning in his last game against them, and eventual 9-8 Rockies victory on 7/24. He’s had multiple solid outings against the Brewers in the past - will he regain that form this evening?\nJosé Iglesias will not be involved in Tuesday’s game, as he was placed on the 10-day injured list earlier today. In his place, Yonathan Daza was activated and will be playing in left field. \nThe creed of “let the kids play” is surely on display, as the lineup contains many a bat that figures to be a key contributor in Colorado’s future. Six of the nine starters are under 30 years of age, including Michael Toglia, who’s in right field and enters Tuesday’s game looking for his first Coors Field long ball.\nFirst Pitch: 6:40 PM MDT\nTV: AT&amp;T Sports Net Rocky Mountain; MLB.tv\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM; KNRV 1150 (Spanish)\nLineups:\n\n\nPick up where we left off. : @BallySportWI  : @620WTMJ#ThisIsMyCrew pic.twitter.com/tTCg1fJY0x— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n#Rockies reinstate IF Yonathan Daza from the 10-day injured list (left shoulder separation) and place INF José Iglesias on the 10-day injured list (retroactive to Sept. 5) with a right hand contusion.... and, lineup card vs. #Brewers. pic.twitter.com/sEHsFuehcg— Thomas Harding (@harding_at_mlb) September 6, 2022",

        "link": "https://www.denverpost.com/2022/09/06/jose-iglesias-injured-list-rockies-solid-season/",
        "description": "Jose Iglesias is a pro&#8217;s pro. That&#8217;s the primary reason why it was so important for the Rockies&#8217; veteran shortstop to perform at a high level this season.\nBut there&#8217;s another reason. Iglesias is scheduled to become a free agent again at the end of the season, and with hot shortstop prospect Ezequiel Tovar on the Rockies&#8217; near horizon, it&#8217;s doubtful the Rockies will make a play to re-sign Iglesias. But other teams will be looking and evaluating.\nIglesias&#8217; fine season, however, has hit a speed bump. He was placed on the 10-day injured list Tuesday with a bruised and swollen right hand and thumb. Still, over the 114 games he&#8217;s played, he has proven he&#8217;s still a productive player.\n&#8220;I feel really good and I feel like I have been really consistent from Day 1 until today,&#8221; the 32-year-old Iglesias said Tuesday before the Rockies hosted the Brewers at Coors Field. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s the main goal as a baseball player; to be consistent on a day-to-day basis and help your team win.\n&#8220;This year has been stable. I had my position, I had my opportunities and I took advantage of it.&#8221;\nIglesias tried to play through his hand injury for about a week but it became too painful to allow him to stay on the field. An MRI on Tuesday revealed no significant damage, and manager Bud Black said the team expects Iglesias&#8217; hand to start feeling better in about six days.\nColorado signed Iglesias to a one-year, $5 million contract during spring training and he&#8217;s performed well. His .300 batting average ranks seventh in the National League and his .333 road batting average ranks third in the majors. He&#8217;s hit .357 with runners in scoring position, tied for seventh in the majors.\nPlus, he&#8217;s fielding his position well and has been a stable, veteran presence on a team in transition and mired in last place in the NL West.\n&#8220;I had not seen a lot of Jose live,&#8221; Black said. &#8220;We always thought of Jose as glove first, but he&#8217;s turned himself, over the years, into a good hitter. He&#8217;s a (.280) lifetime hitter and this year it&#8217;s been proven that he&#8217;s got good bat-to-ball skills, using the whole field. All of those things.&#8221;\nHere&#8217;s a set of statistics that proves Black&#8217;s point: In 21 plate appearances this season with a runner on third and less than two outs, Iglesias has hit 12-for-17 with three sacrifice flies and no strikeouts.\nThe Rockies signed Iglesias during spring training because they needed a veteran shortstop after two-time All-Star Trevor Story signed with Boston.\nDaza returns. Outfielder Yonathan Daza came off the IL and replaced Iglesias on the active roster.  Daza started in left field and hit second in Tuesday&#8217;s game.\nHe went on the IL on Aug. 12 with a left shoulder separation suffered when he fell hard after making a terrific running catch in center field. Daza hit 4-for-12 (.333) across three rehab games with Triple-A Albuquerque.\nBefore he was injured, Daza was playing well, recording a hit in 12 of 17 games (.314, 16-for-51) with five doubles, one home run and five RBIs.\n&#8220;Senza&#8221; update. Black revealed that right-hander Antonio Senzatela underwent surgery to repair the torn ACL in his left knee on Aug. 29. Black said that the surgery went well and the hope is that Senzatela can begin pitching again in six to eight months.\nSenzatela was injured in the second inning of a game at St. Louis on Aug. 18 when he tried to cover first base on Brendan Donovan’s infield single to Elehuris Montero. Senzatela pulled up lame and fell to the ground in obvious pain, clutching his left knee.",

Neither of those dreams came true, but at 50 years old, I’m excited to be involved with the game. When not commiserating about the White Sox, I spend time buying and selling retro video game systems with my son, visiting the 30 baseball stadiums with my husband, cuddling with my two rescue pups, and attending country concerts with my daughter.\n\nHometown I grew up in Shorewood but have lived in Morton (the Pumpkin Capital of the World ... seriously, it is ... Google it) for the past 30+ years. It makes for a long commute to games.\nWhite Sox fan since I was born into a White Sox fan family, but I didn’t really become a die-hard fan until I was 11. It was the Winning Ugly summer of 1983 and I didn’t miss a game. It been a love/hate relationship ever since.\nFirst White Sox memory It was the summer of the 1977 South Side Hit Men. I was five. My dad had the radio on and I remember hearing Harry Caray on the call.\nFavorite White Sox memory Being at the Field of Dreams game in 2021. I’ve been to a lot of baseball games in my life (old Comiskey, new Comiskey, 19 other MLB parks, playoff games) and it’s never felt as magical as it did on Aug. 12, 2021. Every single thing about that experience was perfect. I will always remember how I felt that day when the players walked out of the corn. And you know, the walk-off. It WAS heaven.\nFavorite White Sox player The Commander, Carlton “Pudge” Fisk, No. 72\nNext White Sox statue Ozzie Guillén\nNext White Sox retired number Ozzie Guillén\nGo-to concession food at Sox Park Vegan dog; it’s truly not bad at all. Even my 16-year-old son who does not eat healthy likes it.\nFavorite Baseball Movie Oooh, that’s a tough one. I really have two, and I don’t think I can pick one over the other. Eight Men Out because I love vintage things, history, and the cast. Major League is the other because it’s just so damn funny. Oh, and Tom Berenger was hot in it and he was the catcher. I see a theme with me and catchers.\nHall of Fame: Speed Round\nMark Buehrle NoJoe Jackson YES!Paul Konerko NoDick Allen YesChris Sale No\nSouth Side Sox on the Field Never played, but because catchers are so important and involved in so many aspects of the game, that’s my pick. Plus, you know, Carlton Fisk and Tom Berenger.\nTrue or false: Every jumbled pile of person has a thinking part that wonders what the part that isn’t thinking isn’t thinking of. I’m too old to even understand what this is asking me. So, I asked Alexa and she told me: False.",

        "description": "The White Sox offense did not get the memo that Frank Smith was going to throw a no-no on this day 117 years ago; the 15-0 win remains the biggest margin of victory every for an AL no-hitter. | Chicago Sun-Times/Chicago Daily News collection/Chicago History Museum/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Outstanding pitching feats, by mortals and immortals both, on this day! 1903\nDoc White of the White Sox hurled a one-hitter in beating Cleveland, 1-0, in 10 innings in a game in Chicago. It would be the first of five one-hitters thrown by White between 1903 and 1908 without ever throwing a no-hitter. Cleveland’s only hit was by third baseman Bill Bradley, a double.\nWhite also threw one-hitters against the Browns in 1904, the Athletics and Browns in 1906 and the Senators in 1908. In addition to being a great pitcher, White was also a dentist and evangelist.  \n\n1905\nWhite Sox pitcher Frank Smith tossed a no-hitter at Detroit. The Sox won easily, 15-0, and swept a twin bill, both games by shutouts. In the game, Smith allowed three walks. \nThe 15-0 win stood as the biggest margin of victory in any no-hitter ever thrown in the majors — until 111 years later when Jake Arrieta of the Chicago Cubs no-hit the Cincinnati Reds, 16-0. Smith’s game remains the AL mark for biggest margin.\nSmith would throw a second no-hitter in 1908, and also had three one-hitters between 1905 and 1910.\n\n1919\nDuring ninth-inning garbage time of an 11-2 loss to Cleveland, Buck Weaver tied a major league mark by stealing second, third and home. The White Sox, who had 14 singles in the game but no other hits, remain six games in first place, in pursuit of their second AL pennant in three seasons.\nWeaver went 1-for-4, making the most of his one time on base to circle them with thefts and score Chicago’s final run.\n\n1971\nWhite Sox pitcher Steve Kealey belted a three-run, eighth inning home run at Comiskey Park off of Minnesota’s Ray Corbin in the opener of a twin bill. It helped the Sox to a 6-3 win. It would be the last time a Sox pitcher homered in a game at home. Kealey also picked up the save in the same game, throwing almost three innings. The Sox split the day’s contests.\n\n1981\nIt was the beginning of the end for broadcaster Jimmy Piersall in connection with the White Sox. Piersall and Harry Caray appeared on The Mike Royko Show on WLS-TV. Royko asked the duo how they handle baseball wives who disliked the comments they made about their husbands. Caray said, “You know what, Mike, I would love to call all the wives together someday and tell them what their husbands say about them across the ball field.” Piersall’s answer was more controversial, to say the least. “First of all, they were horny broads that wanted to get married, and they wanted a little money, a little security and a big, strong ballplayer. I traveled, I played. I got a load of those broads, too.” \n\n1999\nIn a doubleheader at Texas, manager Jerry Manuel and star DH Frank Thomas got into an argument after Thomas refused to pinch-hit in the nightcap, claiming he was hurt. Manuel was livid, and sent Thomas back to Chicago. It was discovered after examination by team doctors that Thomas truly was injured; they found a bone spur the size of a walnut on the outside of his ankle, which required surgery and ended his season. \n\n2008\nThe White Sox and Angels battled at U.S. Cellular Field for almost four hours in the middle of a pennant race, and played 15 innings to boot. That’s when Jim Thome blasted a monstrous home run, deep into the right-field bleachers to end the game with a 7-6 White Sox win. The contest set the record for the longest game innings-wise ever played in September by two teams who were both in first place at the time. The home run was Thome’s 30th on the season.",

        "description": "Mixing a small amount of simulated crushed Martian rock with a titanium alloy makes a stronger material in a 3D printing process that could one day be used on Mars to make tools or rocket parts.\nResearchers made the parts with as little as 5% up to 100% Martian regolith, a black powdery substance meant to mimic the rocky, inorganic material found on the surface of the red planet.\nWhile the parts with 5% Martian regolith were strong, the 100% regolith parts proved brittle and cracked easily. Still, even high-Martian content materials would be useful in making coatings to protect equipment from rust or radiation damage, says Amit Bandyopadhyay, corresponding author of the study in the International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology.\n&#8220;In space, 3D printing is something that has to happen if we want to think of a manned mission because we really cannot carry everything from here,&#8221; says Bandyopadhyay, a professor in the Washington State University&#8217;s School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering. &#8220;And if we forgot something, we cannot come back to get it.&#8221;\nBringing materials into space can be extremely expensive. For instance, it costs about $54,000 for the NASA space shuttle to put just one kilogram of payload (about 2.2 pounds) into Earth orbit, the researchers note. Anything that can be made in space, or on planet, would save weight and money—not to mention if something breaks, astronauts would need a way to repair it on site.\nBandyopadhyay first demonstrated the feasibility of this idea in 2011 when his team used 3D printing to manufacture parts from lunar regolith, simulated crushed moon rock, for NASA. Since then, space agencies have embraced the technology, and the International Space Station has its own 3D printers to manufacture needed materials on site and for experiments.\nFor this study, Bandyopadhyay, along with graduate students Ali Afrouzian and Kellen Traxel, used a powder-based 3D printer to mix the simulated Martian rock dust with a titanium alloy, a metal often used in space exploration for its strength and heat-resistant properties.\nAs part of the process, a high-powered laser heated the materials to over 2,000 degrees Celsius (3,632 F). Then, the melted mix of Martian regolith-ceramic and metal material flowed onto a moving platform that allowed the researchers to create different sizes and shapes. After the material cooled down, the researchers tested it for strength and durability.\nThe ceramic material made from 100% Martian rock dust cracked as it cooled, but as Bandyopadhyay points out it could still make good coatings for radiation shields as cracks do not matter in that context.\nBut just a little Martian dust, the mixture with 5% regolith, not only did not crack or bubble but also exhibited better properties than the titanium alloy alone, which meant it could be used to make lighter weight pieces that could still bear heavy loads.\n&#8220;It gives you a better, higher strength and hardness material, so that can perform significantly better in some applications,&#8221; he says.\nThis study is just a start, Bandyopadhyay says. Future research may yield better composites using different metals or 3D printing techniques.\n&#8220;This establishes that it is possible, and maybe we should think in this direction because it’s not just making plastic parts which are weak but metal-ceramic composite parts which are strong and can be used for any kind of structural parts,&#8221; he says.\nThe National Science Foundation supported the research.\nSource: Washington State University\nThe post Dust composite could be used to 3D print stuff on Mars appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Children who walk or bike to school at a young age are more likely to continue the healthy habit as they age, according to a new study.\n&#8220;The walk to school is a wonderful moment in the day that provides children a glimpse of living an active lifestyle,&#8221; says David Tulloch, a professor of landscape architecture at Rutgers-New Brunswick and coauthor of the study in the journal Preventive Medicine Reports. &#8220;When people start walking early, it can have a lasting impact on their health.&#8221;\nIn the United States, about 11% of children walk or bike to or from school, according to data from the National Household Travel Survey. That rate hasn&#8217;t changed in a decade.\nThe researchers found that if children are taught early to actively commute—traveling by physical means—they are far more likely to keep doing so later in their educational career.\nTo measure whether active commuting persists over time, the researchers surveyed parents and caregivers about the school travel habits of their children on two separate occasions two to four years apart (baseline and follow-up) between 2009 and 2017 in four predominantly low-income New Jersey cities: Camden, New Brunswick, Newark, and Trenton.\nThe researchers collected data from 587 households as part of the New Jersey Child Heath Study, which tracked children 3-15 years old. Tulloch and colleagues at the Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis calculated the distance to school and other spatial factors.\nThe researchers found that more than three quarters of children who engaged in active commuting at baseline continued to do so two to four years later, while few newly took it up by the time of follow-up if they hadn&#8217;t done so before. In fact, children who actively commuted to school at baseline were seven times more likely to actively commute two to four years later compared with children who didn&#8217;t actively commute at baseline.\n&#8220;Most kids don&#8217;t achieve the 60 minutes per day of physical activity that they&#8217;re recommended to get,&#8221; says Robin DeWeese, an assistant research professor in the College of Health Solutions at Arizona State University and the study&#8217;s lead author. &#8220;Active commuting to school is one way to get more of that activity.&#8221;\nTo promote active commuting, DeWeese suggests &#8220;schools and communities encourage active commuting during early grades as that may yield benefits even for students in higher grades.&#8221;\nActive commuting varied by demographic characteristics and perceptions of the neighborhood. Children with a parent born outside the US had lower odds of active commuting compared with those whose parents were born in the US, while children of parents who perceived their neighborhood safe from crime were more than 2.5 times as likely to engage in active commuting.\nThe greatest and most persistent barrier was the distance between home and school, Tulloch says. Distance to school often increases as children age because middle and high schools are larger and less prominent than elementary schools. As a result, active commuting likelihood tends to decrease once children reach high school.\nSmarter urban design can help reverse this trend, says Tulloch. Remote drop-offs and &#8220;walking school buses&#8221;—that is groups of students chaperoned by volunteer parents—can encourage children to actively commute at a young age. Infrastructure improvements, such as sidewalks and tree-lined streets, can make walking more pleasant, he adds.\n&#8220;One of the most visited tourist sites in New York City is the High Line, a green walkable space with no cars,&#8221; says Tulloch. &#8220;We should be doing this type of planning everywhere—especially in school zones.&#8221;\nSource: Rutgers University\nThe post Kids who walk to school are more likely to stay active appeared first on Futurity.",

The Braves are riding a wave of confidence following their sweep of the Miami Marlins to cap off a successful homestand last week. They’ll be riding that wave into the Bay Area as they’re set to take on the Oakland A’s for a quick two-game series. With Atlanta inching closer and closer to the top of the NL East, games like this matter a ton — even if the A’s are firmly planted in last place in the AL West. Hopefully we’ll be talking about the Braves taking care of business once it’s all said and done by the end of the night. \n  \n        \n      baseballsavant.com",

        "description": "Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey is projected to win the Democratic primary in the state’s gubernatorial race.\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press called the race at 8:36 p.m.\n\n\n\nHealey was considered the presumptive Democratic nominee after state Sen. Sonia Rosa Chang-Díaz (D) announced earlier in the summer she would be dropping her bid for governor. \n\n\n\nGov. Charlie Baker (R) announced last year he would not seek reelection after eight years in office, leaving the seat open.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Suffolk University-Boston Globe poll released in July found Healey beating both potential GOP nominees in hypothetical general election match-ups.\n\n\n\nThe Cook Political Report rates the Massachusetts governor's race as solid Democrat. \n\n\n\nHealey entered the governor’s race earlier this year and touts endorsements from Massachusetts Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D) and Ed Markey (D), Boston Mayor Michelle Wu (D), state Senate President Karen Spilka (D), and state House Speaker Ron Mariano (D).\n\n\n\nShe also enjoys endorsements from Emily’s List, Giffords, NARAL Pro-Choice America and the Human Rights Campaign PAC, among other top groups.\n\n\n\nHealey became the first openly gay person to be elected as attorney general in the U.S. in 2014. She is in her second term.",

Stand up to this guy.”\n\n\n\nTrump, who defeated Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, has been teasing another run for president in 2024, and polls show he has a good shot of clinching the Republican nomination.\n\n\n\nClinton has said that she would endorse President Biden if he runs for reelection the same year — which he has repeatedly said he plans to do —&nbsp;saying that he would be “the person most likely to win.”\n\n\n\n“Joe Biden beat in a huge landslide victory in the popular vote Donald Trump. I think that says a lot,” Clinton said in a conversation with NBC News anchor Yamiche Alcindor in late June.\n\n\n\nOn CBS, Clinton shot down any comparisons between her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of State and the recent discovery of classified materials at Trump's Florida home, saying the two situations are “really different” from each other.\n\n\n\n“I think it’s a really different comparison to what’s going on here,” Clinton said of her own skirmish with the FBI compared with Trump’s current situation, noting that “it appears that the Justice Department and the FBI have been incredibly patient, quiet, careful until they finally apparently thought that national security was at stake.”",

        "description": "&#8220;A relationship is a physiologic process, as real and as potent as any pill or surgical procedure.&#8221;\n\n&#8220;We can count on so few people to go that hard way with us,&#8221; Adrienne Rich wrote in framing her superb definition of honorable human relationships. It is a cruelty of life that, along the way, people who once appeared fitted to the task crumble in character when the going gets hard in that natural way hardship has of visiting all human lives. \nWhen relationships collapse under the weight of life, the crash is not merely psychological but physiological &#8212; something less and less surprising as we learn more and more about consciousness as a full-body phenomenon beyond the brain. A quarter century ago, the pioneering immunologist Esther Sternberg began demonstrating how relationships affect our immune system. But there is no system they impact more profoundly than the limbic: our neurophysiological command center of emotion &#8212; something psychiatrists Thomas Lewis, Fari Amini, and Richard Lannon explore throughout their revelatory book A General Theory of Love (public library), which also gave us their insight into music, the neural harmonics of emotion, and how love recomposes the brain.\nArt by Maurice Sendak from a vintage children&#8217;s book by Janice May Urdy.\nThe profound disruption of relationship rupture, they observe, is related to our earliest attachments and the way our system processes separation from our primary caregivers &#8212; a primal response not singular to the human animal:\nTake a puppy away from his mother, place him alone in a wicker pen, and you will witness the universal mammalian reaction to the rupture of an attachment bond &#8212; a reflection of the limbic architecture mammals share. Short separations provoke an acute response known as protest, while prolonged separations yield the physiologic state of despair. \nA lone puppy first enters the protest phase. He paces tirelessly, scanning his surroundings from all vantage points, barking, scratching vainly at the floor. He makes energetic and abortive attempts at scaling the walls of his prison, tumbling into a heap with each failure. He lets out a piteous whine, high-pitched and grating. Every aspect of his behavior broadcasts his distress, the same discomfort that all social mammals show when deprived of those to whom they are attached. Even young rats evidence protest: when their mother is absent they emit nonstop ultrasonic cries, a plaintive chorus inaudible to our dull ape ears.\nBehaviorally and psychologically, the despair phase begins when fretfulness, which can manifest as anxiety in humans, collapses into lethargy &#8212; a condition that often accompanies depression. But abrupt and prolonged separation produces something much more than psychological havoc &#8212; it unleashes a full-system somatic shock. Various studies have demonstrated that cardiovascular function, hormone levels, and immune response are all disrupted. Thomas Lewis, Fari Amini, and Richard Lannon capture the result unambiguously:\nRelationship rupture is a severe bodily strain&#8230; Prolonged separation affects more than feelings. A number of somatic parameters go haywire in despair. Because separation deranges the body, losing relationships can cause physical illness.\nBut harrowing as this reality of intimacy and its ruptures may be, it also intimates something wonderfully assuring in its mirror-image &#8212; just like painful relationships can so dysregulate us, healthy relationships can regulate us and recalibrate our limbic system, forged in our earliest attachments.\nThe solution to the eternal riddle of trust emerges as both banal and profound &#8212; simply the practice of continually refining our discernment about character and cultivating intimate relationships of the kind life&#8217;s hard edges cannot rupture, with people who are the human equivalent not of poison but of medicine, and endeavoring to become such people ourselves for the emotional ecosystems of those we love. \nThomas Lewis, Fari Amini, and Richard Lannon write:\nA relationship is a physiologic process, as real and as potent as any pill or surgical procedure.\n[&#8230;]\nTotal self-sufficiency turns out to be a daydream whose bubble is burst by the sharp edge of the limbic brain. Stability means finding people who regulate you well and staying near them.\nThis might sound simple, almost simplistic, but it is one of the most difficult and redemptive arts of living &#8212; for, lest we forget, &#8220;who we are and who we become depends, in part, on whom we love.&#8221;\nComplement with Alain de Botton on the psychological Möbius strip that keeps us in unhealthy relationships (and how to break it) and David Whyte on the deeper meanings of friendship, love, and heartbreak, then revisit Hannah Arendt on what forgiveness really means.\ndonating = lovingFor a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the unbearable name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

        "description": "“A document describing a foreign government’s military defenses, including its nuclear capabilities, was found by FBI agents who searched former president Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence and private club last month,” the Washington Post reports.\n\n\n\n“Some of the seized documents detail top-secret U.S. operations so closely guarded that many senior national security officials are kept in the dark about them. Only the president, some members of his Cabinet or a near-Cabinet-level official could authorize other government officials to know details of these special-access programs.”\n\n\n\n“Documents about such highly classified operations require special clearances on a need-to-know basis, not just top-secret clearance. Some special-access programs can have as few as a couple dozen government personnel authorized to know of an operation’s existence. Records that deal with such programs are kept under lock and key, almost always in a secure compartmented information facility, with a designated control officer to keep careful tabs on their location.”",

But the warm ambience of cicadas, Jimmy Little country tunes, and the gently percussive thock thock thock of a rally in the distance takes us to another time and country altogether.We meet Evonne Goolagong Cawley (Ella Ferris) at home by the river, casting a line into the water. She loves fishing, she says, which can be a lot like tennis; catching a fish requires a sharp eye, every single muscle, and of course, knowing where the “sweet spot” is. Continue reading...",

Hope everyone had a great, long weekend — especially after yesterday’s South Side win! Today, the Chicago White Sox and Seattle Mariners will face off in the second game of this three-game series. \nFor today’s game 25-year-old righty, Logan Gilbert, will be on the mound for the Mariners. He holds a 11-5 record, 3.35 ERA and 1.21 WHIP in 27 games. The ChiSox faced him earlier this year on April 14, where he went five innings giving up four hits, no earned runs, and four strikeouts to get the win. Gilbert mostly uses three main pitches; his fastball being used most often at 55%, with an average velocity of 96 mph. He follows it with a slider (23%), and curveball (15%). Occasionally, he will throw in a changeup (8%) as well. \nJohnny Cueto will make his 20th appearance of the season for the White Sox, as he currently holds a 7-6 record, 2.93 ERA, and 1.17 WHIP. He has been incredible on the mound this year for the South Siders. In his last outing against the Kansas City Royals, he went 5 1⁄3 innings with just six hits, one earned run, and five strikeouts for the win. Cueto uses a variety of four pitches, with his fastball being used the most at 43% with an average velocity of 92 MPH. He follows it with a changeup (22%), slider (18%), and cutter (16%). \nTonight the White Sox will put out this lineup to face Gilbert and the Mariners. Yoán Moncada back in playing third and Robert in CF. Good to have the boys back! \n\n\nTonight's #WhiteSox starters in Seattle. ⏰: 8:40 p.m. CT : @NBCSChicago  : @ESPN1000  : @FDSportsbook  : O/U 3.5 CWS Total Runs pic.twitter.com/kUdcyQOrc0— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Mariners hope to come back from last night’s loss with this lineup to face Cueto.\n\n\nlineup!!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/Omg4DYu62i— Seattle Mariners (@Mariners) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nIt’s a late one tonight. Game time is at 8:40 p.m. CST. Watch on NBCSCHI and listen in at ESPN 1000.",

        "description": "Marlins right-hander Nick Neidert recently underwent surgery to address a right knee injury, tweets Jordan McPherson of the Miami Herald. The 25-year-old has been on the minor league injured list since August 9. Further details about the procedure aren&#8217;t clear, but it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise if that brings his 2022 season to an end.\nIt has been a frustrating year for Neidert, a former second-round pick of the Mariners. Traded to Miami in the Dee Strange-Gordon swap, Neidert was at one point viewed as a potential back-of-the-rotation stalwart. He&#8217;s generally performed well in the minor leagues but hasn&#8217;t managed to translate that into MLB success. Neidert carried a 4.70 ERA through 44 MLB innings heading into this season, and the Marlins outrighted him off their 40-man roster just before Opening Day.\nHe&#8217;s subsequently had a solid run with Triple-A Jacksonville, pitching to a 1.96 ERA through 46 innings. The Georgia native fanned an above-average 26.1% of batters faced while only walking 4.9% of opponents, and he reclaimed a spot on the 40-man roster in July. Neidert came up for a spot start, tossed five innings of two-run ball, and was optioned back to Jacksonville. After one additional Triple-A start, he landed on the shelf.\nNeidert continues to count against Miami&#8217;s 40-man roster while he&#8217;s on the minor league injured list. The Marlins could recall him and place him on the MLB 60-day IL if he&#8217;s indeed out for the season, although doing so would require paying him at the prorated $700K minimum rate.",

        "description": "Photo by Justin Berl/Getty Images\n    \n\n  This really sucks, guys.  Last year, Taijuan Walker started a game in Pittsburgh after a 2-game losing streak that went a little nutty early on before coming back to win. Tonight, by the bottom of the fifth, the Mets were down four. Could this be a repeat performance? \nSpoiler alert: it was not. \nThings did not go the Mets’ way from the start in this game. In just the second at bat, Starling Marte was hit on the hand by a pitch by Mitch Keller and left the game. He was being sent for imaging.\nWalker did not look great tonight, but wouldn’t have had a terrible night if not for a foul-pole striking two-run home run off the bat of Rodolfo Castro. The other two Pittsburgh runs came on a second inning sacrifice fly and a fifth inning single to Bryan Reynolds that plated Oneil Cruz. \nWalker wound up going five innings, striking out three and walking two. Earlier in the season, a four run deficit would’n’t have seemed like an insurmountable one, but the Mets have been playing like lethargic trash over the last few days, and four runs suddenly seems like double digits. \nHowever, in the seventh inning, Brandon Nimmo hit a two-run home run, scoring [checks notes] James McCann? He got on base? [Checks notes again] He got a hit? What the? \nMychel Givens relieved Walker, and despite putting two men on base, escaped the jam and continued his mini-resurgence. Rookie Bryce Montes de Oca was next in line, and looked strong for his first inning before a combination of a few hits and shotty defense led to two more runs coming in in the bottom of the eighth.\nMontes de Oca was relieved by Tommy Hunter, who gave up a towering, literally out of the ballpark, home run on what looked like a lazy swing to Pirates’ phenom Oneil Cruz. It was such an amazing sight to behold that I honestly can’t be mad about it. \nThe loss marks the third straight game that the Mets have dropped to a very bad team by six runs. As a team with a slim, one game lead as the Braves are about to start play, this is not the way to be playing right now. \nSB Nation GameThreads\nAmazin’ AvenueBucs Dugout\nBox scores\nMLB.comESPN\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs.com\n      Mets vs Pirates 9/6/22 WPA Chart\n  \nWhat’s WPA?\nBig Mets winner: Absolutely no one.

She urged the Canberra press gallery to cut politicians 'some slack' to encourage more everyday Australians to enter politics. Tyrrell represents Tasmania for the the Jacqui Lambie Network and spoke passionately about the devastating effects of long-term unemployment – something she has experienced herself.

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/rangers-nathaniel-lowe-breakout-slugger.html",
        "description": "The Rangers&#8217; shift from a rebuilding mindset into a win-now mode began in the offseason with a combined $556MM spent on Corey Seager, Marcus Semien and Jon Gray. It continued over the summer when Texas held onto several trade candidates of note (e.g. Martin Perez, Matt Moore) and overhauled their leadership; gone were manager Chris Woodward and longtime president of baseball operations Jon Daniels, leaving the team likely to conduct a managerial search this winter and leaving third-year GM Chris Young with full baseball operations autonomy.\nAnother aggressive winter seems likely, as the Rangers still have plenty of work to do on an improved but flawed roster. There&#8217;s been talk of a new contract with lefty Martin Perez, following his breakout in a return to his Rangers roots, but that&#8217;d only be one piece of the puzzle. There&#8217;s hope that Josh Jung will solidify third base, but there are questions behind the plate, in the outfield and on the pitching staff.\n\nTexas has currently dropped nine games in a row, erasing any delusions that perhaps this team may be turning the corner right now, but that doesn&#8217;t mean there aren&#8217;t bright spots to the season. Seager has hit well. Semien has shaken off a disastrous start and, since mid-May, looked quite strong. Gray has lived up to his own multi-year deal. Perhaps the brightest spot of all, however, has come in the form of a breakout for slugger Nathaniel Lowe.\nAcquired in a Dec. 2020 trade that sent three minor leaguers to the Rays, the now-27-year-old Lowe had a solid but uneven first year in Texas. He homered six times in his first 22 games (98 plate appearances) as a Ranger before settling in at a more modest, but still productive pace. Lowe continued hitting well but &#8220;only&#8221; chipped in another 12 home runs over his next 544 plate appearances. He finished the year as a .264/.357/.415 hitter &#8212; 14% better than league average, by measure of wRC+.\nFor much of the 2022 season, Lowe looked quite similar; he posted a 115 wRC+ in the season&#8217;s first half slashing .270/.323/.429. Since the All-Star break, however, Lowe has been not only the Rangers&#8217; best hitter, but one of the best hitters in Major League Baseball. He&#8217;s slashing an absurd .363/.414/.632 with 11 homers, nine doubles and two triples in just 186 plate appearances. In that time, 52.3% of the balls off his bat have been hit 95 mph or greater; his average exit velocity has spiked from 89.3 mph to 91.3 mph, and he&#8217;s gone from barreling 7.9% of the balls he puts into play to a much heftier 12.9%.\nThis torrid six-week stretch has bolstered Lowe&#8217;s season line to a robust .302/.355/.500, and he&#8217;s hitting .282/.356/.455 in a total of 1172 plate appearances since being traded to Texas in the first place.\nThis is probably the best stretch of Lowe&#8217;s big league career, but he&#8217;s been quietly productive from the day he got to the big leagues in 2019 and increasingly looks the part of a bona fide middle-of-the-order hitter. Skeptics will point to this year&#8217;s .358 average on balls in play and wonder when he might regress, but it&#8217;s not a given, or even likely, that he will. Lowe touts a .346 BABIP in 1417 career plate appearances, suggesting that he&#8217;s capable of sustaining a mark well north of the league average (.291 this season).\nUnlike many players who keep their BABIP figures high, Lowe isn&#8217;t beating close grounders and getting there via his wheels; rather, he does so by effectively spitting on any shifts against him. Lowe leads the Majors in opposite-field hits dating back to 2021, and he&#8217;s tied with Giancarlo Stanton for the game&#8217;s third-base wRC+ mark when hitting to the ball the opposite way during that time (only Tim Anderson and Aaron Judge have been better).\nLowe has only been shifted in 20.1% of his plate appearances this season, which isn&#8217;t among the very lowest rates in the league but is well below the league average. Moreover, the only lefties who rank below him (min. 250 plate appearances) are Raimel Tapia, Nicky Lopez, Luis Arraez, Steven Kwan, Luis Guillorme, Luis Gonzalez, Joey Wendle, Michael Harris II, Adam Frazier, Eric Hosmer, Riley Greene, Brandon Nimmo, Brendan Donovan and J.P. Crawford. There are some good hitters in that bunch (Kwan, Arraez, Nimmo and Harris in particular), but it&#8217;s mostly a list of contact-oriented hitters who don&#8217;t pose much of a power threat. With the exception of Harris, there&#8217;s no lefty-swinging slugger in MLB who is shifted less frequently than Lowe.\nSimilarly, Lowe isn&#8217;t fazed by left-handed pitching. His 141 wRC+ mark against lefties over the past two seasons is 26th among qualified hitters and trails only Matt Olson, Yordan Alvarez and Anthony Rizzo for the top mark among left-handed hitters in that time. Again, it&#8217;s tempting to say there&#8217;s just been some small-sample, BABIP-related luck in play, but in 2022 Lowe has punched out less against fellow lefties and hit for more power than against southpaws than when holding the platoon advantage. It&#8217;s not a simple case of some bloop singles falling in and inflating his stat line; he&#8217;s genuinely been a better hitter against lefties this year.\nIf there&#8217;s a knock on Lowe&#8217;s game, it has nothing to do with his work at the plate. His defense, however, is quite suspect by most public measures. Defensive Runs Saved (-7) and Statcast (11 outs and 8 runs below average) feel he&#8217;s been among the game&#8217;s worst defenders at his position (or at any position, for that matter). No player in the Majors has made more errors at first since the start of the 2021 season than Lowe&#8217;s 20. (Miguel Sano is close, in far fewer innings, but the point stands.)\nEven if there&#8217;s a move to more designated hitter work in Lowe&#8217;s future, though, his bat should more than carry him at that position. He doesn&#8217;t draw many walks but has above-average contact skills, even when chasing pitches off the plate, and his ability to flip balls out to left field (or, in some instances, crush them into the left-field seats) should serve him well in that capacity even if he never pares back his higher-than-average chase rate.\nAlthough Lowe has now played in parts of four Major League seasons, he&#8217;ll finish out the 2022 campaign shy of three years of Major League service time. At two years, 145 days he&#8217;ll be a lock for Super Two status and reach arbitration this winter, where his power numbers and durability will serve him well. That shouldn&#8217;t matter much for a Rangers club that spent more than a half billion dollars in free agency that winter, and finishing at two-plus years of service means Lowe will be controllable for another four seasons, through his age-30 campaign.\nThe Rays deservedly have a reputation for being a risky team with which to trade, and there&#8217;s plenty of time for any of Heriberto Hernandez, Osleivis Basabe or Alexander Ovalles to make the trade look more palatable from their vantage point. All three are having strong seasons, and Hernandez in particular is ranked anywhere from 23rd (Baseball America) to eighth (FanGraphs) among Tampa Bay farmhands. But as things stand right now, the Rangers have a middle-of-the-order complement to Semien and Seager for the next four years, and they&#8217;re not desperately missing any of the players they surrendered to acquire him.",

        "description": "FBI agents who searched former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home found a document detailing a foreign government’s nuclear capabilities and other military defenses, The Washington Post reported on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe document containing the nuclear information was found during the Aug. 8 search that was authorized by an FBI affidavit that has now been released with redactions. The sources did not disclose to the Post the identity of the foreign government.\n\n\n\nThe Post had reported in August that the FBI was searching in part for documents containing nuclear information, something Trump later dismissed as a \"hoax.\" \n\n\n\nThe search took place more than a year and a half after Trump’s departure from office and uncovered 100 classified documents.\n\n\n\nSome of the documents seized by the FBI in its raid of Mar-a-Lago were reportedly cleared on a need-to-know basis rather than being open to specific members of the government with high-level security clearances, according to sources who spoke to the Post.\n\n\n\nDocuments at the same level of security as the ones flagged by the Post’s sources are normally locked in a secure facility where their location is able to be tracked.\n\n\n\nThe 100 found during the Mar-a-Lago search were added to a total of 300 classified documents that have been retrieved since Trump left office in 2020.\n\n\n\nThe others were found when boxes of records were sent to the National Archives and Records Administration and later in response to a further probe by investigators. A judge on Monday verified Trump’s request to appoint a special master to review the documents found in the Mar-a-Lago search, meaning that an independent person will look into the information being assessed by the courts.\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Trump, the FBI and the Justice Department for comment.",

        "description": "Former state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who has the endorsement of former President Trump, is projected to win the Republican primary in the Massachusetts governor’s race.\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press called the race at 10 p.m. ET.\n\n\n\nDiehl beat back a challenge from moderate businessman Chris Doughty and will take on Attorney General Maura Healey (D) in November. \n\n\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R), who has served eight years in office, announced last year he would not seek reelection.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDiehl received coveted endorsements from Trump and former Trump aide Corey Lewandowski and campaigned on a platform that included supporting small business, election integrity and public safety.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, it’s unclear how much Trump’s endorsement will help Diehl in November. Trump lost the state in 2020 with 32 percent of the vote compared to President Biden’s 66 percent, and a Suffolk University-Boston Globe poll released in July found Healey leading Diehl in a hypothetical match-up among likely general election voters 54 percent to 23 percent.\n\n\n\nThe Cook Political Report rates the general election race as \"solid Democratic.\" \n\n\n\nDiehl began his career in the state legislature in 2011 and later announced a Senate bid to take on Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for her seat in 2018. He ultimately lost that Senate bid after Warren received 60 percent of the vote to Diehl’s 36 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLike Trump, Diehl has pushed dubious claims about the 2020 election,&nbsp;according to The Associated Press. He has backed the Supreme Court’s ruling to eliminate the constitutional right to an abortion and was against COVID-19 restrictions.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Former Washington Commanders team president Bruce Allen testified before the House Oversight and Reform Committee in its investigation into workplace misconduct allegations against the NFL franchise. \n\n\n\nAllen, who is the son of former Commanders head coach George Allen, delivered a deposition remotely to the House panel on Tuesday after being handed down a notice to appear before the committee. \n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the committee confirmed to The Hill that the former team president testified before the committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The Committee is continuing to investigate the decades-long workplace misconduct at the Washington Commanders and the NFL’s failure to address it,” the panel’s spokesperson told The Hill.  “Mr. Allen served in senior roles under team owner Dan Snyder for many years, so his testimony is important for the Committee to fully understand these serious issues and advance reforms to protect workers in the future.”\n\n\n\nA source told The Washington Post that the 66-year-old former team executive refused to testify unless he was subpoenaed by the committee. Allen reportedly would’ve been accused of violating his separation agreement with the franchise if he had testified before the congressional committee  without a subpoena. \n\n\n\nBoth Snyder and Roger Goodell, the NFL's commissioner, recently testified before the House panel in the team’s investigation. \n\n\n\nAllen’s testimony comes after the committee launched its probe into the Washington Commanders organization and Snyder in October after Allen’s email chain with former NFL head coach Jon Gruden, which contained racist, homophobic and misogynistic language and was part of the NFL’s initial investigation into the team, was leaked to the public.\n\n\n\nThe leaked email chain, which spanned seven years, also led Gruden, who won a Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, to resign from his position as head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders. \n\n\n\nGruden, who recently said he was “ashamed” for taking part in that leaked email chain with Allen,  filed a lawsuit against the NFL in November alleging that the league deliberately leaked his emails to media outlets in an effort to force him out of his job. \n\n\n\nIn a memo released earlier this year, the committee's chairwoman, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), said that Snyder and his legal counsel sent private investigators to the homes of the accusers and gathered thousands of emails from Allen in an attempt to show that former team executive created a toxic work environment within the franchise.\n\n\n\nAllen, who said that the Washington, D.C.-based NFL organization had a “damn good” culture, was relieved of his duties as team president in December 2019 after spending 10 seasons with the organization. \n\n\n\nThe NFL launched its second investigation into the team earlier this year after former cheerleader and marketing manager Tiffani Johnston, while speaking at a House Oversight and Reform Committee roundtable discussion on the matter, accused Snyder of sexually harassing her during a work-related dinner.\n\n\n\nSnyder, who has owned the Commanders since 1999, has publicly denied the allegations against him and his NFL franchise.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a statement to The Hill, one of the attorneys representing the former Commanders employees involved in the investigations applauded the news of Allen’s testimony. \n\n\n\n“I am pleased that the Committee on Oversight &amp; Reform continues its important work in investigating the allegations of a toxic workplace culture and financial improprieties at the Washington Commanders,” attorney Lisa Banks said in a statement. “Given his long tenure and close relationship to Dan Snyder and Commanders top management, Bruce Allen should be in a unique position to shed light on the many important issues being examined by the Committee.”\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the Washington Commanders and the attorneys for Dan Snyder for comment and more information.&nbsp;",

        "description": "“I hit bombs.” | Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  There was a Cruz missile too, but Rodolfo Castro got the bomb party started. A solid performance by Mitch Keller and Pirates bats coming to life were key in the Pirates’ 8-2 bombing of the Mets, 8-2.\nKeller pitched six scoreless innings, with five hits, two walks and two strikeouts, getting (for him) a rare win in PNC. I’m in agreement with my colleagues that Keller’s outings this year have been a bright spot in what’s been a dismal Pirates season. Even when he’s Bad Mitch, there’s not the sense that he can’t dig himself out like there was last year, when you could visibly see him deflate if he got in trouble.\nAnd then there was the run support. Kevin Newman and Jack Suwinski singled in the second inning, and Michael Chavis’s sac fly got the Pirates on the board first. In the third inning, Bryan Reynolds walked, then there was this:\n\n\n\nCastro crushed it. pic.twitter.com/6MPYmzC6bP— Pittsburgh Pirates (@Pirates) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nThen the Pirates played small ball. Oneil Cruz doubled in the fifth inning, and a B-Rey single brought him home. But the inning that sealed the deal was the eighth. Mets reliever Bryce Montes de Oca walked Ke’Bryan Hayes, who then stole second, and Kevin Newman singled him home. Jason Delay did the same for Newman. But what got everyone excited and filled up Twitter was Oneil Cruz, who deposited a ball into the Allegheny:\n\n\nONEIL CRUZ HIT THIS BALL INTO THE ALLEGHENY pic.twitter.com/W4og6C92Rj— Pittsburgh Pirates (@Pirates) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nAnd that was it. The Mets got on the board courtesy of a two-run homer by Brandon Nimmo in the seventh off Robert Stephenson, but that was the sum total of their offense. Nimmo’s homer was the only extra-base hit. Every Pirate got on base, even Ben Gamel, who didn’t get a hit but walked. The foundations for the Pirates of the Future are being laid, and that could be seen in this game.  So let’s enjoy this.\n\n\n#RaiseIt pic.twitter.com/7pPJ5ygUd9— Pittsburgh Pirates (@Pirates) September 7, 2022",

        "title": "★ A Quick Run-Through of Rumors and Speculation Ahead of This Wednesday’s ‘Far Out’ Event for the iPhones 14, New Apple Watch Models, and Who Knows What Else",
        "link": "https://daringfireball.net/2022/09/far_out_rumor_roundup",
        "description": "Name Games\n\nThe long-rumored lineup of iPhone 14 models is that the Mini is out of the lineup, and replacing it is a big-screened non-Pro model. So: two 6.1-inch new iPhones (regular and Pro), and two 6.7-inch new iPhones (regular and Pro). The Pro models, presumably, will be named iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. On the non-Pro side, one late-breaking rumor claims the big-screen model will be named iPhone 14 Plus, not “Max”.\n\nThis rings true to my Apple-marketing-attuned ears. Max, in Apple parlance, seems to mean more than just bigger — it implies a certain premium-priced technical sophistication as well. Max means something akin to “even more Pro than Pro”, like with the M1 Max chips. Thus, I think “Plus” fits perfectly for the 6.7-inch non-Pro iPhone 14 models.\n\nOn the Apple Watch front, Mark Gurman has been reporting for a long time that Apple is poised to release a new model (or models?) targeting the market for extra durability for sports and fitness, and has been speculating since July that it might be named “Apple Watch Pro”. This one doesn’t ring as true to my ears. I can hear it, because sometimes when Apple describes a product as “pro”, they really just mean “nicer in some ways”, not necessarily “better suited for professional usage”. Are AirPods Pro more professional than regular AirPods? No, but they’re more pro in Apple parlance, because they’re nicer.\n\nI’m not sure that works for a more rugged/extreme Apple Watch, though. If this model is as big and chunky as these leaked CAD renderings indicate, I’d expect a name that implies ruggedness/sportiness, and I don’t think “Pro” does that. Apple Watch Extreme? Apple Watch Sport (which would hark back to the Series 0 lineup, where the aluminum models were called “Sport”)? I just don’t think “Pro” quite fits for a lineup where there already exist premium-priced models. Last year’s Series 7 Edition models, made from titanium, cost $800/850 for the 41/45 mm sizes respectively, and the Hermès models start at $1,250. Perhaps Apple will eliminate the titanium Edition models from the lineup, but from what I understand, the Hermès partnership has been very successful. “Pro” carries a connotation of superiority, so I can’t quite see Apple using that name for a bigger, chunkier, decidedly un-luxurious model.\n\nOh, how about “Apple Watch Max”? That works for me. Skips right over “Pro” and goes right to “big ass and more expensive”, sort of like AirPods Max except AirPods Max aren’t something you’d wear while climbing a mountain.\n\nThe Price Is Right\n\nLast year the iPhones started at these prices (128 GB):\n\n\n13 Mini: $700 (+$30 bullshit carrier fee)\n13: $800 (+$30 bullshit carrier fee)\n13 Pro: $1000\n13 Pro Max: $1100\n\n\nI’m thinking this year the new models (128 GB) will be priced like this:\n\n\n14: $800 (+$30 bullshit carrier fee)\n14 Plus: $900 (+$30 bullshit carrier fee)\n14 Pro: $1050\n14 Pro Max: $1150\n\n\nThe basic idea, I think, is to slowly but surely put more space between the regular new iPhones and the Pro models. Better cameras (more than just an extra third lens — better across the board), better displays (ProMotion), better chips (A16 vs. A15X or whatever they’re going to call it). Some people might think the 14 Plus would be more expensive, so as not to cannibalize sales of the 14 Pro Max, but Apple keeps its eye on the real prize: profit margin, not revenue. I think the iPhone 14 Plus, even if $250 cheaper than the 14 Pro Max, will be as profitable, if not more so.",

        "description": "Jay Biggerstaff-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Don’t look now, but the Guardians have a winning streak Cleveland starting pitcher Shane Bieber pitched came up an inning short of a complete game Tuesday night, with a Salvador Perez solo home run representing the lone blemish over his eight innings of work as the Guardians bested the Kansas City Royals, 4-1, for their second straight win.\nIt was a bit of an uncharacteristic outing for Bieber, as he de-emphasized his slider and knuckle curve in favor of his cutter and four-seam fastball. The former accounted for 41 percent of his pitches Tuesday night, earning nine swings and misses. Bieber allowed four hits and one walk over eight innings, surrendering the aforementioned solo shot to Perez in the fourth inning. He finished the game with seven strikeouts and retired the final eight batters he faced.\nWith a left-hander on the mound in the form of Kris Bubic and his 5.47 ERA, it was an open question whether the Guardians’ anemic offense would be able to do much damage. But they managed to break through in the third inning thanks in part to the bottom of the order, as Austin Hedges drew a one-out walk and Myles Straw followed with a single. With two outs, Amed Rosario hit a sharp single to right field, loading the base for Jose Ramirez. Ramirez singled through the left side of the infield to plate a pair of runs and give Cleveland a 2-0 lead.\nThe offense went quiet again until the seventh inning, when Straw knocked in Tyler Freeman from third base with an RBI single. Yes, that means Straw reached base twice in the game. The last insurance run came courtesy of Bobby Witt Jr. in the eighth inning. With two outs and Oscar Gonzalez on third, Owen Miller hit a slow roller to Witt at shortstop and he proceeded to air-mail the throw to first base, allowing Miller to reach and the run to score.\nJames Karinchak pitched a scoreless ninth to close out it out for the Guardians.",

        "title": "★ A Quick Run-Through of Rumors and Speculation Ahead of This Wednesday’s ‘Far Out’ Event for the iPhones 14, New Apple Watch Models, and Who Knows What Else",
        "link": "https://daringfireball.net/2022/09/far_out_rumor_roundup",
        "description": "Name Games\n\nThe long-rumored lineup of iPhone 14 models is that the Mini is out of the lineup, and replacing it is a big-screened non-Pro model. So: two 6.1-inch new iPhones (regular and Pro), and two 6.7-inch new iPhones (regular and Pro). The Pro models, presumably, will be named iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. On the non-Pro side, one late-breaking rumor claims the big-screen model will be named iPhone 14 Plus, not “Max”.\n\nThis rings true to my Apple-marketing-attuned ears. Max, in Apple parlance, seems to mean more than just bigger — it implies a certain premium-priced technical sophistication as well. Max means something akin to “even more Pro than Pro”, like with the M1 Max chips. Thus, I think “Plus” fits perfectly for the 6.7-inch non-Pro iPhone 14 models.\n\nOn the Apple Watch front, Mark Gurman has been reporting for a long time that Apple is poised to release a new model (or models?) targeting the market for extra durability for sports and fitness, and has been speculating since July that it might be named “Apple Watch Pro”. This one doesn’t ring as true to my ears. I can hear it, because sometimes when Apple describes a product as “pro”, they really just mean “nicer in some ways”, not necessarily “better suited for professional usage”. Are AirPods Pro more professional than regular AirPods? No, but they’re more pro in Apple parlance, because they’re nicer.\n\nI’m not sure that works for a more rugged/extreme Apple Watch, though. If this model is as big and chunky as these leaked CAD renderings indicate, I’d expect a name that implies ruggedness/sportiness, and I don’t think “Pro” does that. Apple Watch Extreme? Apple Watch Sport (which would hark back to the Series 0 lineup, where the aluminum models were called “Sport”)? I just don’t think “Pro” quite fits for a lineup where there already exist premium-priced models. Last year’s Series 7 Edition models, made from titanium, cost $800/850 for the 41/45 mm sizes respectively, and the Hermès models start at $1,250. Perhaps Apple will eliminate the titanium Edition models from the lineup, but from what I understand, the Hermès partnership has been very successful. “Pro” carries a connotation of superiority, so I can’t quite see Apple using that name for a bigger, chunkier, decidedly un-luxurious model.\n\nOh, how about “Apple Watch Max”? That works for me. Skips right over “Pro” and goes right to “big ass and more expensive”, sort of like AirPods Max except AirPods Max aren’t something you’d wear while climbing a mountain.\n\nThe Price Is Right\n\nLast year the iPhones started at these prices (128 GB):\n\n\n13 Mini: $700 (+$30 bullshit carrier fee)\n13: $800 (+$30 bullshit carrier fee)\n13 Pro: $1000\n13 Pro Max: $1100\n\n\nI’m thinking this year the new models (128 GB) will be priced like this:\n\n\n14: $800 (+$30 bullshit carrier fee)\n14 Plus: $900 (+$30 bullshit carrier fee)\n14 Pro: $1050\n14 Pro Max: $1150\n\n\nThe basic idea, I think, is to slowly but surely put more space between the regular new iPhones and the Pro models. Better cameras (more than just an extra third lens — better across the board), better displays (ProMotion), better chips (A16 vs. A15X or whatever they’re going to call it). Some people might think the 14 Plus would be more expensive, so as not to cannibalize sales of the 14 Pro Max, but Apple keeps its eye on the real prize: profit margin, not revenue. I think the iPhone 14 Plus, even if $250 cheaper than the 14 Pro Max, will be as profitable, if not more so.",

        "description": "Photo by Ed Zurga/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Royals have managed just six hits and one run against Bieber in two games this year. Shane Bieber continued his mastery over Royals hitters by allowing just one run over eight innings in a 4-1 Royals loss on Tuesday evening. Including his Opening Day start against Kansas City, Bieber has allowed just one run in 12 2⁄3 innings with 11 strikeouts and just 1 walk in his two Kauffman Stadium starts, with Royals hitters batting just 6-for-44 (.136) against him.\nKris Bubic went for the Royals, and the lefty pitched well enough to win, lasting six innings for the second start in a row. The Guardians got to him for a pair of runs in the third when he let the bottom of the order get to him. Austin Hedges walked and #9 hitter Myles Straw (who has been awful in the second half) singled. Amed Rosario singled to load the bases and Royals-killer Jose Ramirez singled to plate two and make it 2-0 Cleveland.\nThe Royals got one run back in the fourth when Salvador Perez homered, his 20th of the season. It gives Salvy his sixth 20-home run season tied with Mike Sweeney for the second-most such seasons in club history behind only George Brett.\n\n\n\nSalvy with the oppo pop! Home run #⃣2⃣0⃣ this season. TV: Bally Sports Kansas CityStream: https://t.co/pPyLByLnhZ#Royals pic.twitter.com/O2K5dFjPLN— Bally Sports Kansas City (@BallySportsKC) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\nAfter a seventh-inning single with one out, Bubic would exit the game. That runner came around to score on a Straw single, giving Bubic three runs allowed on six hits with one walk and four strikeouts. He threw 69 of his 95 pitches for strikes (72 percent). \nBrad Keller would give up an eighth-inning run to make it 4-1 and that would be much too great a deficit for the Royals to overcome tonight. Bieber retired 22 of the 27 Royals hitters he faced, including the last 11 batters he faced. James Karinchak shut down the Royals 1-2-3 in the ninth.\nThe Royals drop to 55-82 and will need to win tomorrow night to avoid the sweep. Zack Greinke is expected to start against Guardians rookie Cody Morris at 7:10 CT.",

        "description": "Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Marlins continue streaking in the wrong direction, having scored only five total runs on their NL East road trip. Bad teams find ways to lose. It can’t be pinned on a single player or coach—it’s a group effort that often leads to disappointing nights like this one.\nWhile Marlins relief pitcher Tommy Nance is one of the few Miami relievers to not get an audition as a closer this year, it was his second game this week in which he gave up the game-winning or go-ahead run in the ninth inning or later. On August 30, he gave up the go-ahead run against the Tampa Bay Rays in the 10th inning, then on Tuesday, he gave up a walk-off single to the Philadelphia Phillies in the ninth inning.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, as previously mentioned, these losses can not be pinned on one person. In that decisive ninth inning, left fielder Brian Anderson ran in to catch a Bryce Harper pop-up along the left field foul line. He began a slide that would have likely allowed him to make the catch for the second out of the inning. But possibly due to the rainy conditions in Philadelphia during the game and throughout the day, Anderson slipped and flopped to the ground. Harper advanced to second, and scored two batters later on a Jean Segura single.\nAlthough Anderson has plenty of recent experience in right field, this was only his eighth major league game in left.\nOne could also make the argument that the game wouldn’t have had to come down to that play if the Fish had scored more than two runs. Entering Tuesday, the Marlins had averaged 1.4 runs over the previous eight games.\nIt was Phillies starting pitcher Aaron Nola’s turn to shut the Marlins offense down. Aside from two RBI from Anderson on a single in the fourth and a sacrifice fly in the eighth, Nola was dominant. He got 10 strikeouts, including his 200th of the season. \nThe Marlins threatened to score in the ninth inning when Garrett Cooper drew a walk and was subsequently pinch-ran for by Luke Williams. While Williams has been great on the basepaths this year for Miami, a questionable steal attempt on a 3-0 count disrupted the small rally the Marlins had going on.\nMarlins starting pitcher Jesús Luzardo once again showed promise on the mound. He allowed two runs and collected nine strikeouts in seven innings. \nWorking deep into games has recently become commonplace for Luzardo. Since his return from the IL on August 1, he’s now had three outings of seven-plus innings; prior to that, he had only one such start in his career.\n\n\nJesús Luzardo, Wicked 85mph Breaking Ball...and K Strut. ✝️ 7th K. pic.twitter.com/o4y9xZGKMa— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\nLuzardo’s final line would have been even better if not for an out at home plate which was overturned via replay review. It was determined that Nick Fortes illegally blocked the plate and didn’t provide a lane for Edmundo Sosa to use. Impressive throw by Anderson regardless.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \n\nThe Marlins will try to end their eight-game losing streak on Wednesday against the Phillies at 6:45 p.m. Trevor Rogers will take the mound against Bailey Falter.",

        "description": "Adbert Alzolay | Bruce Kluckhohn-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Adbert Alzolay has a solid rehab appearance as Iowa wins. The Smokies edge closer to a playoff spot with a blowout win. The Pelicans win on a walk-off errror. Iowa Cubs\nThe Iowa Cubs breaded the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp (Marlins), 6-2. In the history of the Iowa Oaks/Cubs that dates back to 1969, Iowa has never lost a game to Jacksonville.*\nAdbert Alzolay started this game on a rehab assignment and it didn’t look good to start. The first batter he faced singled and then stole second and went to third on a throwing error by catcher John Hicks. Then the second hitter singled him home to make it 1-0 and Alzolay hadn’t even recorded an out.\nBut things got a lot better after that. The third hitter bounced into a double play and then Alzolay settled down for three strong innings. He allowed one run on three hits. Alzolay struck out two and did not walk anyone.\nThe win was awarded to Blake Whitney, because Alzolay didn’t go five innings. Whitney earned it though by retiring all six batters he faced in two innings. Whitney struck out one.\nShortstop Luis Vazquez hit a solo home run in the third inning, his first Iowa home run and ninth overall. Vazquez went 1 for 4.\nThird baseman Levi Jordan chipped in an insurance run with a solo home run in the seventh inning. Jordan now has 12 home runs this season, six with Iowa and six with Tennessee. He went 2 for 4 and scored twice.\n*This is the first time that Iowa has ever played Jacksonville. \nTennessee Smokies\nThe Tennessee Smokies reeled in the Pensacola Blue Wahoos (Marlins), 14-4. The win reduced the Smokies magic number for clinching a playoff berth to two. \nStarter Chris Clarke was the beneficiary of all this offense and he cruised to his tenth win of the season and seventh with Tennessee. Clarke allowed just one run on five hits over six innings. He struck out five and walked only one.\nThird baseman Jake Slaughter hit two home runs tonight, including a two-run home run in the bottom of the first and a grand slam in the eighth inning. Slaughter now has hit 22 home runs this season and 19 with the Smokies. Slaughter went 2 for 4 with a walk and he was hit by a pitch. He had the six runs batted in and he scored four times.\nRight fielder Yonathan Perlaza hit a solo home run in the sixth, his 23 this year. Perlaza went 2 for 5 with a walk.\nFirst baseman Bryce Ball had a pair of doubles in a 2 for 4 evening. He also walked once. Ball scored two runs and drove in one. \nLeft fielder Nelson Maldonado also doubled twice and went 2 for 4 with a walk. He had a two-run double in the third inning and Maldonado scored two times.\nShortstop Andy Weber went 2 for 4 with an RBI double. He was also hit by a pitch once.\nThe Smokies had 14 hits tonight and all nine batters had at least one. \nThe Smokies can clinch a playoff spot on Wednesday with a win and a loss by the Birmingham Barons. \nSlaughter’s home runs:\n\n\nHRs number 18 and 19 for Jake Slaughter tonight, including a mammoth grand slam. pic.twitter.com/2e1LsevWuZ— Brad (@ballskwok) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nSouth Bend Cubs\nThe South Bend Cubs were shucked by the Cedar Rapids Kernels (Twins), 8-6. This series in Cedar Rapids is a preview of next week’s first round of the Midwest League playoffs.\nStarter Chris Kachmar only went two innings and only gave up one hit and one unearned run. He struck out three and walked no one.\nThe loss went to Riley Martin, who allowed one run on three hits over two innings of relief. Martin struck out two and walked one.\nThe score was 2-1 Kernels heading into the bottom of the ninth when Cedar Rapids plated six runs off of reliever Bailey Reid in his only inning of work. South Bend struck back with five runs in the top of the ninth and brought the tying run to the plate with two outs, but their comeback fell short when Luis Verdugo flew out to center field.\nSecond baseman Fabian Pertuz went 3 for 4 with a double. Pertuz had an RBI single in the ninth and he later scored that inning. \nLeft fielder Jordan Nwogu hit a two-run double in the ninth. He also scored the first run of the game in the first inning. Nwogu went 2 for 5.\nFirst baseman B.J. Murray Jr. was 2 for 4 with a double. He singled in a run and scored in that five-run ninth.\nMyrtle Beach Pelicans\nThe Myrtle Beach Pelicans filleted the Carolina Mudcats (Brewers) 5-4 in ten innings. \nMichael Arias started and pitched the first three innings without allowing a run. He did give up two hits and issued four walks while striking out two.\nThe win went to Angel Hernandez who pitched the ninth and tenth innings. Hernandez gave up the unearned run in the tenth on no hits and no walks. He did hit one batter and struck out one.\nThe game ended in the bottom of the tenth when center fielder Kevin Alcantara hit a high infield pop up that second baseman Robert Moore dropped for a game-ending error. He didn’t get an RBI for that, but Alcantara did get two RBI when he connected for his 15th home run of the year in the third inning. Alcantara went 2 for 5.\nEarlier in the third, second baseman Juan Mora hit a solo home run, which was his sixth this season. Mora went 2 for 5 and scored the winning run running from second base on the dropped pop up in the tenth. \nThird baseman James Triantos went 1 for 4 and scored a run. That extended his hitting streak to 13 games. \nHighlights:",
