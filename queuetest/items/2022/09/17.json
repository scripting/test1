        "description": "<p>The Red Sox are designating catcher Kevin Plawecki for assignment, reports Chris Cotillo of MassLive (Twitter link). Boston has yet to formally announce the move, but their 40-man roster tally is slated to drop to 38.</p>\n<p>Plawecki has spent the past three seasons in Boston, with much of that time backing up Christian Vázquez. The right-handed hitting backstop performed well in a limited role between 2020-21, but he’s had a rough go of things in 2022. Through 173 plate appearances, Plawecki carries a .219/.291/.290 line with one home run. He’s made plenty of contact, but he hasn’t made a huge impact from a power perspective.</p>\n<p>Boston dealt Vázquez to the Astros at the trade deadline, but they also brought in the lefty-hitting Reese McGuire in a subsequent trade with the White Sox. McGuire and the right-handed Connor Wong have joined Plawecki on the active roster since the rosters expanded in September. Both McGuire and Wong are controllable for multiple seasons beyond this year, while Plawecki was headed for free agency. With the Red Sox playing out the final few weeks of what’s likely to be a last place campaign, they’ll devote more playing time to their controllable options while cutting Plawecki loose a bit early.</p>\n<p>Plawecki will land on outright or release waivers in the next few days. In either event, he’ll hit the open market is he goes unclaimed. That seems likely, as any claiming team wouldn’t be able to carry Plawecki on a postseason roster since he wasn’t in the organization prior to September 1. Plawecki’s also making $2.25MM this season, and while the final few hundred thousand dollars of that deal aren’t onerous, it decreases the chance of another team adding him as a strictly a regular season depth option for the final two and a half weeks. In all likelihood, Plawecki will head to the open market a bit early and turn his attention to next offseason.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Dodgers hurler Tony Gonsolin is continuing to work his way back from a right forearm strain, having been placed on the 15-day injured list on August 29. Gonsolin’s rehab hasn’t moved as quickly as the team had initially hoped, but Jack Harris of the Los Angeles Times relays that he’s responded well to a bullpen session earlier this week. Gonsolin’s role with the Dodgers upon his return is not set in stone, with Gonsolin revealing that he and manager Dave Roberts have discussed “different routes” for his role when he returns.</p>\n<p>In his first full season starting, Gonsolin has been nothing short of remarkable, pitching to a 2.49 ERA, 23.7 K%, 7.2 BB% in 128 1/3 innings (23 starts). These impressive numbers propelled him to his first All-Star game, but he has already surpassed his previous max innings pitched, 128, set in 2018. Additionally, after dealing with a forearm strain, it makes sense why the Dodgers may be hesitant in pushing their young, controllable starter before their upcoming playoff run.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere around the division…</p>\n\nGiants stalwart Brandon Belt is entering free agency coming off his third surgery on his right knee, but he told Andrew Baggarly of The Athletic this week that his knee “feels great” roughly two weeks after surgery. Belt says that he feels “like a brand-new person,” while adding that he knows there is “a lot more left in me” and explaining he has already shed his crutches. Belt also added that he has roughly four weeks of rehab before he will be back to normal – plenty of time for a normal offseason preparation. Belt expressed interest in returning to San Francisco but indicated he’d be willing to play elsewhere if the team were “ready to move on.” The 34-year-old did not categorically rule out the idea of retiring, stating that “it needs to be the right situation for me to keep going” and that it doesn’t make sense to “go play for nothing” while stating he wouldn’t accept a minor league contract. Although Belt put forth a disappointing 2022 season, slashing .213/.326/.350 for a .676 OPS, he is less than a year removed from posting back-to-back .900+ OPS seasons and is a career .261/.356/.458 hitter.\nThe Rockies have still yet to officially shut down third baseman Kris Bryant for the season. However, there’s still no timetable for Bryant’s return to the field. In a chat with reporters (including The Athletic’s Patrick Mooney) this afternoon, Bryant stated that the Rockies want him “to feel really good going into the offseason” and that he wants an “offseason that’s as close to normal as possible.” With those sentiments, it appears likely that the 30-year-old will not take the field again this season with the Rockies destined to miss the playoffs for the fourth season in a row. Overall, Bryant is in the first year of a seven-year, $182MM contract, but has only appeared in 42 games with the Rockies while being placed on the injured list three times for a strained lower back and plantar fasciitis in his left foot. Nevertheless, when healthy he performed at a high standard, slashing .306/.376/.475 for a .851 OPS, albeit in a hitter-friendly environment.",

        "description": "Photo by Larry Radloff/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The 5-0 lead quickly given to Frankie Montas didn’t last, as the trade deadline addition struggled again before Milwaukee walked it off.</p> <p>The Yankees traveled to Milwaukee to face a Brewers team that projects a nice parallel with them on a few levels. Coming off an NL Central win in 2021, the Brew Crew held a comfortable grip on a postseason berth and possible repeat crown in the first half, but recent scuffles have changed things a bit. They are only close in the postseason race due to the Padres’ own slump as the lowest current Wild Card seed.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s pitching matchup was supposed to give the Yankees a considerable advantage. Even while recognizing the struggles of Frankie Montas in a Yankees uniform, he should have been capable of comfortably beating both Milwaukee’s backend starter, Adrian Houser, and the inferior Brewers offense. Unfortunately for the Yankees, the feeling that we were seeing the same pitcher on both sides was palpable, as Montas played down to his competition and squandered a 5-0 lead. He was gone by the time Milwaukee tied it and long-showered when the Brew Crew walked it off, but his woes remained the story of the night.</p>\n<p>The Yankees ‘offense jumped the Brewers’ starter in the first inning. Houser’s been notoriously better at home than on the road in 2022, with a very respectable 3.21 ERA in American Family Field, but that didn’t materialize in tonight’s outing. Five of the seven first Yankee hitters reached base, and three came in to score by the time Montas took the mound. Gleyber Torres’ one-out double made the damage possible, as that allowed Aaron Judge to score on Josh Donaldson’s sacrifice fly, and the second out was soon followed by RBI singles from Isiah Kiner-Falefa and Marwin Gonzalez.</p>\n\n\n<p>3 runs in the 1st   pic.twitter.com/kTL5lhws8U</p>— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>By the second inning, the Yankees held a comfortable lead that was increased to 5-0 on an error from Kolten Wong. However, from the way that Montas was pitching from the get-go, it felt like only a matter of time for even the maligned Brewers’ lineup to put their team back in the game.</p>\n<p>Montas loaded the bases in the first but got out of it with an Andrew McCutchen groundout, and it looked like he was going to escape another jam in the second inning. He struck out both Garrett Mitchell and Christian Yelich following the first two hitters reaching base, but then the former Ray Willy Adames got ahold of a hanging slider, which he drove it into the left-field seats to make this a 5-3 game.</p>\n\n<p>With the understanding that pretty much every game is a must-win affair for the Brewers, manager Craig Counsell already had his ‘pen moving around in the first inning. By the fourth, he pulled his starter Houser with a whopping 85 pitches over 3 frames.</p>\n<p>In the home half of the fourth, the Milwaukee offense was at it again. Montas’ last batter of the night was Mitchell, the No. 9 hitter who he’d struggled to put away in his previous at-bat. This time, Mitchell walked, and Aaron Boone called on Lucas Luetge; the skipper had no interest in having Montas face the top of the Brewers’ order again. But Milwaukee scored twice to tie the game at 5-5 anyway, as Yelich singled, Adames doubled one in, and Rowdy Tellez evened the score on a sacrifice fly.</p>\n<p>The theme of tonight’s game for both pitchers was their inability to put hitters away, with Montas and Houser combining for 7 walks, and averaging 31 pitches per inning through the first three. Montas needed 71 to get 9 outs, which was hardly better than Houser’s aforementioned margin.</p>\n<p>It’s telling that it seems like a distant memory, the notion that Brian Cashman brought Frankie Montas in from the Oakland A’s to be this team’s Game 2 starter in the postseason. Now, you wonder just where exactly he would fit in that playoff rotation (if at all), especially with Luis Severino coming back next week.</p>\n<p>Both pitching staffs had the tall task of getting far more outs than previously expected, but they turned in zeroes for most of the ballgame. Greg Weissert, Domingo Germán, Wandy Peralta, and Lou Trivino kept Milwaukee off the board in the middle innings, and five different Brewers pitchers shut the Yankees out for six innings. The last of the five was airbender extraordinaire Devin Williams, who flummoxed the top of the New York order in the top of the eighth.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Loáisiga took over for the home half of the eighth, when a few well-placed Brewers grounders put them ahead. The right-hander’s leadoff walk to Jace Peterson came back to bite him. After a force out at second, Mitchell grounded one that deflected off Torres’ diving attempt and went for a single. Yelich then just barely beat out a potential double play ball, and Adames rolled one to the third-base side of Kiner-Falefa, who bobbled it. The error gave Milwaukee a 6-5 lead.</p>\n<p>The Yankees came back in the ninth on a solo shot by Donaldson to tag Taylor Rogers with a blown save.</p>\n\n<p>Alas, New York was unable to do more despite the Oswaldo Cabrera double that immediately followed. IKF bunted him to third, Miguel Andújar went down on a questionable strike three (Boone was later ejected arguing this), and Kyle Higashioka flew out. The latter two batters were only in the game because Gonzalez departed with an illness and Jose Trevino was pulled after suffering a painful knee contusion.</p>\n<p>This was also one of those nights when Clay Holmes didn’t have it —something that has become all-too-common in the second half. Hunter Renfroe started the ninth with a booming double, and he moved to third on a groundball. The Yankees shuffled around their defensive setup with five infielders, but Holmes could not get a handle on the strike zone. He walked McCutchen, fell behind Peterson before recovering to fan him, issued a second free pass to catcher Victor Caratini, and finally coughed up the walk-off single to Mitchell</p>\n\n<p>As a reminder, this is still the same Mitchell who entered tonight hitting .138/.242/.276 across the first 13 games of his MLB career. No, this was not a good night for the Yankees, who lost their four-game winning streak and were unable to chip away at their magic number due to the Blue Jays’ 6-3 victory over the Orioles. New York’s AL East lead fell to 5.5 games with 18 to play.</p>\n<p>The two sides will go back at it tomorrow night, with Jameson Taillon squaring off with Brandon Woodruff. First pitch will be at 7:10pm ET.</p>\n<p>Box Score</p>",

Think about domination and you’ll get exactly Friday’s game. With three home runs from Yordan Álvarez and a flawless Justin Verlander –returning from the IL—, the Astros defeated the Athletics 5-0 and reached a postseason berth. For the sixth consecutive year, they’ll be playing in October.</p>\n  \n        \n      Erik Williams-USA TODAY Sports\n  \n<p>On Friday, the Astros reached the playoffs in fashion, just demolishing the A’s in the series opener en route to their sixth straight win. Yordan’s first-inning four-bagger against starter Adrián Martínez was the spark for a brilliant showing in front of 33,850 souls at Minute Maid Park.</p>\n\n\n<p>44 goes 434. pic.twitter.com/2jsIBUnccq</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>In the third, Álvarez launched his 35th bomb of the campaign, also a solo jack to put the Astros ahead 2-0. In spite of being up only by two runs, Verlander was throwing pure evil and kept opposing hitters off throughout the night.</p>\n\n\n<p>They never learn. pic.twitter.com/dlWkhAtwPG</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth inning was a key one. First, Jeremy Peña hit a home run of their own (18). And the atypical, special thing was about to be seen: Álvarez clubbed a mammoth dinger for his 36th of the season and third of the night, the second-longest home run of his career (464 feet).</p>\n\n\n<p>HE'S A BAD, BAD MAN. pic.twitter.com/kSOGpihvcE</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Air Yordan becomes only the third player in Astros history with two or more three-homer games. The other two are Jeff Bagwell (3) and Glenn Davis (2). He’s also the fourth Cuban player to record the homer trifecta twice, along with Kendrys Morales, José Canseco, and Yoenis Céspedes.</p>\n<p>With the Astros winning 4-0, Verlander was at his best despite not pitching in the Majors since August 28 due to injury. JV worked five full innings, did not allow a hit, walked just one, plunked Ramón Laureano, and struck out nine hitters. Not only did he improve his record to 17-3 but he also lowered his ERA to 1.79.</p>\n<p>With this solid performance, Verlander evaporated the uncertainty around him about pitching beyond September. At this point, he remains the strongest candidate for the American League Cy Young award. Over his three most recent starts, JV has 14 innings pitched, no runs, three hits, two walks, and 25 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Phil Maton (2 innings), Ryne Stanek, and Bryan Abreu combined to throw four scoreless innings with seven punchouts to reach the remarkable victory.</p>\n<p>José Urquidy will take the ball for Houston to start Saturday’s game for an interesting matchup against lefty Cole Irvin during the second game of the series.</p>\n<p>VIDEOS AND BOX SCORE HERE.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Every year the Annenberg Center conducts a survey of civics knowledge among American adults and every year we obligingly fail it miserably. This gives older Americans a chance to complain about how modern education is a shambles compared to the rigorous standards of their day¹ and it gives Annenberg a chance to moan about how knowledge of civics is essential to participation in a democratic society blah blah blah.</p>\n<p>But beware of glass houses. Here are the results of one question over the past few years:</p>\n<p>Take a look at freedom of religion: Annenberg claims that last year 56% of all adults knew that this was part of the First Amendment, but this year only 24% knew it. That's a whole lot of forgetting in the space of one year! On the other hand, it went up from 15% to 47% between 2017 and 2020. We sure got a lot smarter during the Trump administration!</p>\n<p>The other questions show similar spikes. This is obviously ridiculous and suggests that Annenberg knows very little about statistics or polling—something that might be more important in modern democracies than being able to name the three branches of government. Can anyone explain what's going on here?</p>\n<p>¹This is because they never seem to realize that the Annenberg survey is a survey of adults, not high school kids.</p>\n\nFacebook  \nTwitter \nEmail\nPrint",

The full-season caveat is necessary because the 2020 Dodgers, over the pandemic-truncated 60-game season was 22-8 (.733) on the road.</p>\n<p>That Brooklyn team in 1952 played only 75 games on the road because of bad September weather. A doubleheader set for Philadelphia on September 1 was rained out, and by the time the two teams made up the games, three weeks later, they played both games at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn instead. The starting pitcher for one of those makeup games, which clinched the pennant, is the subject of a Dodgers rewind coming next week.</p>\n<p>To put this year’s Dodgers in perspective, their 50-26 (.658) road record is better than 25 MLB teams’ home records this season.</p>\n<p>With those five road games still left on the schedule — two left in San Francisco, and three in San Diego from September 27-29 — the Dodgers have a chance to join a select group. Since the advent of the 162-game schedule in 1961 (in the American League; the National League moved to 162 games one year later), only 12 teams have won at least 53 road games in a season. Only four have won 54 or more road games.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>5 hitless innings for May in LA’s third shutout win in four games</p> <p>Dustin May was magnificent after a couple shaky starts, limited only by a pitch count limit in his fifth start since returning from Tommy John surgery. May pitched five hitless innings to lead the Dodgers over the Giants 5-0 in the opener of a weekend series at Oracle Park in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Friday’s win was the Dodgers’ 50th road win of the season, the third time in franchise history they’ve reached that milestone, matching the 1974 team for the most away wins in a season since moving to Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>With 99 wins on the season, the Dodgers’ magic number over St. Louis to clinch a bye into the National League Division Series is down to four.</p>\n<p>May allowed only a second-inning walk to Brandon Crawford, then promptly erased him on a double play, one of seven ground balls induced by May that led to outs. He also struck out four, and retired his last 10 batters faced before getting pulled after 69 pitches.</p>\n<p>The limit on May came for a reason.</p>\n\n\n<p>Dave Roberts said Dustin May’s start tonight had been pushed back due to some arm soreness after his last start. They’d rather be overly cautious with him, which is part of why they capped his pitch count tonight even after 5 no-hit innings. Will pitch on regular rest next time.</p>— Fabian Ardaya (@FabianArdaya) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Complete control was a welcome sight for May, who walked eight and hit three batters over 10 innings in his previous two starts, both losses.</p>\n<p>The faint hope of a combined no-hitter ended with a two-out infield single by Luis González off reliever Alex Vesia in the sixth. But May’s outing was the ninth time this season a Dodgers starter allowed no hits through at least five innings.</p>\n\n<p>There are numerous reasons why the Giants haven’t been able to keep pace with the Dodgers like last season, including how Logan Webb has fared against Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>San Francisco’s ace in 2021 had a 1.47 ERA in five starts against the Dodgers, including allowing only one run in 14⅔ innings in two National League Division Series starts. But this year the Dodgers have scored 14 runs and 27 hits in 21 innings against Webb, including forcing him to throw 90 pitches in four innings on Friday</p>\n<p>Los Angeles bunched together four hits in the fourth inning to break the game open a bit, scoring three runs in the inning on singles by Chris Taylor, Cody Bellinger, and Trea Turner after Justin Turner’s double to open the frame.</p>\n<p>Justin Turner, wearing a number 21 jersey on Friday as the Dodgers’ nominee for the 2022 Roberto Clemente Award, also doubled off lefty Thomas Szapucki in the fifth, Turner’s second double of the night and 35th of the season, the latter a career high.</p>\n<p>Joey Gallo was heavily involved early on, first making a sliding shoestring catch in the left field corner to end the opening frame.</p>\n\n\n<p>WOW, JOEY. pic.twitter.com/Awcdj0AIiF</p>— Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Max Muncy doubled to open the second inning, well out of the reach of centerfielder Mike Yastrzemski, who was mic’d up and interviewed during the frame on the Apple TV+ broadcast. Muncy advanced to third on a groundout, then beat the throw home on another grounder, a fielder’s choice by Gallo.</p>\n  \n        \n      Apple TV+ used a split screen during most of its interview with centerfielder Mike Yastrzemski during the Dodgers vs. Giants game on September 16, 2022 at Oracle Park in San Francisco.\n  \n\n<p>Perhaps you might have missed the play as Apple TV+ used a split screen during the interview with Yastrzemski, putting both the game and the centerfielder on tiny portions of the screen, negating any advantages of the visual wizardry of the Apple TV+ broadcast.</p>\n<p>They are not the only network who uses the split screen during interviews — ESPN and Fox do as well — but a simple plea to sports broadcasting networks: We can hear the player or coach being interviewed and don’t need to see said subject during the process. That’s what our ears are for. The game is the thing that deserves full attention, visually.</p>\nOf note\n<p>Bellinger stole two bases on Friday. Gallo and Trea Turner stole one apiece, giving the Dodgers four stolen bases for the first time in 2022. It matched LA’s total steals (in eight attempts) in their first 16 games against the Giants this season.</p>\nFriday particulars\n<p>Home runs: none</p>\n<p>WP — Dustin May (2-2): 5 IP, 1 walk, 4 strikeouts</p>\n<p>LP — Logan Webb (13-9): 4 IP, 7 hits, 4 runs, 2 walks, 2 strikeouts</p>\nUp next\n<p>Saturday is the lone game of series with local announcers on television (6:05 p.m., SportsNet LA), with Julio Urías on the mound for the Dodgers.</p>",

Adrian Houser was on the mound for the Brewers, facing Frankie Montas for New York. </p>\n<p>The Yankees jumped all over Houser in the first, scoring three runs on a sacrifice fly and two RBI singles, giving New York an early 3-0 lead. The Yankees would then add to their run total in the top of the second, as Josh Donaldson hit a fielder’s choice that Kolten Wong committed an error on, allowing the Yankees to get two more runs across. </p>\n<p>Willy Adames and the Brewers would answer back in the bottom of the second, as he hit a three-run home run to cut the New York lead to two. Montas was replaced in the fourth inning, and the Brewers had immediate success, with both Adames and Rowdy Tellez getting RBIs in the inning. The game stood at 5-5 heading into the fifth. </p>\n<p>After clean innings from both bullpens, the Brewers would gain the lead as Hiura scored on a fielding error by Isiah Kiner-Falefa off the bat of Adames. The Yankees would then strike right back to tie it up as Donaldson cranked a solo home run to lead off the top of the ninth off Taylor Rogers. </p>\n<p>With the game tied, the bases loaded, and two men out, rookie Garrett Mitchell hit a walk-off single up the middle to score Hunter Renfroe from third, giving the Brewers a massive home victory. </p>\n<p>The Brewers will now finish their three-game set with the Yankees before welcoming the Mets to Milwaukee for another three-game series. The starter for Saturday’s game for the Brewers will be Brandon Woodruff opposite Jameson Taillon for the Yankees. The first pitch will be at 6:10 CDT on Bally Sports Wisconsin and 620 WTMJ.</p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "Owen Caissie | Photo by Brandon Sloter/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>South Bend wins and advances to the title series. Iowa wins their third in a row. </p> <p>Everybody celebrate, because South Bend is going to the Midwest League Championship Series!</p>\n<p>If you ask me, South Bend is going for back-to-back Midwest League title. They won the title in 2019. Of course, there was no minor league season in 2020 and in 2021, South Bend played in a league called “High-A Central.” So this is the first “Midwest League Championship Series” since the Cubs beat Clinton in 2019. </p>\n<p>South Bend is playing at home at 6:05 Eastern time on Sunday if anyone is looking to go. </p>\n<p>South Bend Cubs</p>\n<p>The South Bend Cubs harvested the Cedar Rapids Kernels (Twins), 9-3. South Bend wins the three-game series, two games to one.</p>\n<p>The Cubs jumped all over Kernels starter Orlando Rodriguez in the top of the first inning. The first three batters loaded the bases on a walk, a single and a walk and then a sacrifice fly by Owen Caissie made it 1-0. The next batter, Luis Verdugo, doubled in two more runs to make it 3-0. B.J. Murray Jr. then singled home Verdugo and Rodriguez was pulled from the game after only a third of an inning. The Cubs failed to tack on any more runs in the first, but they had a 4-0 lead that would turn out to be all they would need.</p>\n<p>South Bend added another run in the second inning when Jordan Nwogu walked, stole second and went to third on a bad throw by the catcher and then scored on an infield error.</p>\n<p>Pete Crow-Armstrong singled to lead off the fourth inning. He first stole second base and then he stole third. He then scored South Bend’s sixth run on Caissie’s second sacrifice fly of the game.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, South Bend starter Daniel Palencia turned in his best start of the season. Palencia struck out eight and walked no one over five scoreless innings. He allowed just two measly singles as he picked up the win.</p>\n<p>Crow-Armstrong scored his third run of the game and Caissie drove in his fourth with an RBi single in the top of the sixth to make it 7-0.</p>\n<p>The only time South Bend had to sweat in this game was in the bottom of the seventh inning when Riley Martin got into trouble. Martin loaded the bases with no outs on a single and two walks. A sacrifice fly made it 7-1 and then after the runners moved to second and third on an infielder ground out, a two-run single by Mikey Perez made it 7-3 and ended Martin’s night. </p>\n<p>Martin finished with a line of three runs on two runs over 1.2 innings. He walked two and struck out one. </p>\n<p>But Michael McAvene was summoned from the bullpen in the seventh and he ended the threat with one pitch and a fly out to left. He then retired the side in order in the eighth. After the SB Cubs tacked on two runs in the top of the ninth, Jake Reindl was summoned to close out the game. He retired all three batters, one by strikeout, to end the game and the series.</p>\n<p>Crow-Armstrong went 3 for 5 with two steals and three runs scored tonight.</p>\n<p>Caissie was 2 for 3 with a double, two sac flies and four total RBI. </p>\n<p>Nwogu was 1 for 3 with two walks and a steal. Nwogu scored three times.</p>\n<p>Murray was 2 for 4 with a walk and two RBI. </p>\n<p>Catcher Pablo Aliendo was 2 for 5.</p>\n<p>South Bend will take on the Lake County Captains (Guardians) in a best-of-three Championship Series, starting on Sunday in South Bend. Games two and three, if necessary, will be in Lake County on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Here’s the final pitch of the game and the on-field celebration:</p>\n\n\n<p>Fly the W!<br /><br />With three knocks from top @Cubs prospect Pete Crow-Armstrong in the clincher, the @SBCubs are going to the Midwest League Championship Series: https://t.co/J5bFxRwclJ pic.twitter.com/We60a8dAZ7</p>— Minor League Baseball (@MiLB) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the clubhouse celebration:</p>\n\n\n<p>Let the celebration begin!<br /><br />Your #SBCubs are going to the Midwest League Championship for the 2nd time in three season! <br /><br />Game one at @FourWindsField Sunday at 6:05pm.#CubsWin #FlyTheW pic.twitter.com/CZWbc918F7</p>— South Bend Cubs (@SBCubs) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Iowa Cubs</p>\n<p>The Iowa Cubs tagged the Memphis Redbirds (Cardinals), 7-6. It was Iowa’s third-straight win after a five-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>Keegan Thompson started this game on a rehab assignment. Thompson gave up a one-out double to Kramer Robertson, who went to third on a ground out and scored on a wild pitch. That would be the only hit and run Thompson would allow. Thompson’s final line was one run on one hit over 2.1 innings. Thompson struck out four and walked one. He threw 45 pitches and 26 were strikes. </p>\n<p>Kervin Castro got the win because Thompson didn’t go five innings. Castro allowed one run on one hit over 2.2 innings. He struck out four and walked no one. The one hit he allowed was a double to a rehabbing Dylan Carlson.</p>\n<p>Dakota Mekkes gave up a run in the eighth, but he retired the side in order in the ninth and got the save. Mekkes’ final line was one run on two hits over 1.1 innings. Mekkes struck out two and walked one. </p>\n<p>Right fielder Jackson Frazier hit a solo home run in the fourth inning, his sixth on the season. Frazier went 2 for 4.</p>\n<p>Third baseman Esteban Quiroz cracked a solo home run in the sixth. Quiroz was 3 for 4 with three RBI.</p>\n<p>Catcher John Hicks doubled in a run and scored as part of a four-run bottom of the first inning. Hicks went 2 for 4. </p>\n<p>DH Alexander Canario hit his first Triple-A extra-base hit when he hit an RBI double in the bottom of the first inning. Canario went 2 for 3 and he scored one run.</p>\n<p>First baseman Matt Mervis went 2 for 4 with one run scored.</p>\n<p>Tennessee Smokies</p>\n<p>The Tennessee Smokies were extinguished by the Chattanooga Lookouts (Reds), 13-12 in 13 innings. </p>\n<p>Ben Brown started this one and allowed two runs, one earned, on five hits over four innings. Brown struck out eight and walked two.</p>\n<p>Peyton Remy would give up five runs over three innings of relief. Kyle Johnson gave up one over his two innings.</p>\n<p>Blake Whitney got tasked with throwing the tenth, eleventh and twelfth innings. When the Smokies scored one run in the tenth, Whitney gave up one in the bottom of the inning. When the Smokies scored three runs in the top of the 12th, Whitney gave up three runs in the bottom of the inning. His final line was four runs, one earned, on five hits over three innings. Whitney struck out six and walked four, but three of those walks were intentional.</p>\n<p>Jake Washer got called in from first base to pitch the bottom of the 13th and took the loss. Washer allowed one unearned run on one, hit, one walk and one hit batter over one-third of an inning. </p>\n<p>Third baseman Jake Slaughter hit a two-run home run in the top of the ninth inning to tie the game 8-8 and send it to extras. It was Slaughter’s 23rd home run this season and number twenty with the Smokies. Slaughter was 2 for 6 with a walk and he drove home three total runs. Slaughter also stole a base. </p>\n<p>DH Nelson Maldonado hit a three-run home run in the top of the 12th to give the Smokies a 12-9 lead (That they couldn’t hold). Maldonado went 2 for 4 with a walk. He scored three runs and drove in four.</p>\n<p>Center fielder Zach Davis went 2 for 4 with two walks and a steal. Zinn scored three times and had one RBI.</p>\n<p>Catcher Harrison Wenson was 2 for 7 with a double and a stolen base. Wenson scored two runs.</p>\n<p>Right fielder Yonathan Perlaza reached base five times with four walks and a double. He was 1 for 3 with one run scored and one RBI.</p>\n<p>First baseman Bryce Ball fouled a ball off his ankle and had to leave the game. He walked off on his own power, but with a limp. Ball went 1 for 5 with a walk.</p>\n<p>Left fielder Cole Roederer went 3 for 7.</p>\n<p></p>",

Soft fruits will break down naturally, but if you’re using a harder fruit such as pear or peach, grate or chop it up first.

To serve two, pour 100ml dry gin and 100ml fresh lime juice into a shaker, add ice, shake hard, then strain into two glasses filled with crushed ice.

        "description": "<p>The big story in the news over the past couple of days is that Florida governor Ron DeSantis chartered two planes to fly about 50 migrants, most of whom were from Venezuela, to Martha’s Vineyard, off the coast of Massachusetts. <br /><br />The story is still developing. Although DeSantis is the governor of Florida, the migrants appear to have come from Texas, and it currently appears that they were lured onto the planes—paid for with taxpayer money—with the false promise of work and housing in New York City or Boston. In addition, there are allegations from a lawyer working with the migrants that officials from the Department of Homeland Security falsified information about the migrants to set them up for automatic deportation. As I write this, it is not clear what their actual status is: have they applied for asylum and been processed, or are they undocumented immigrants?<br /><br />As Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo says, none of it adds up. <br /><br />None of it, that is, except the politics. DeSantis apparently dispatched the migrants with a videographer to take images of them arriving, entirely unexpectedly, on the upscale island, presumably in an attempt to present the image that Democratic areas can’t handle immigrants (in fact, more than 12% of the island’s 17,000 full-time residents were born in foreign countries, and 22% of the residents are non-white). But the residents of the island greeted the migrants; found beds, food, and medical care; and worked with authorities to move them back to the mainland where there are support services and housing. In the meantime, there are questions about the legality of DeSantis chartering planes to move migrants from state to state.<br /><br />There are two big stories behind DeSantis’s move. <br /><br />First is that the Republicans are on the ropes over the Supreme Court’s June 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health decision and the capture of the party by its MAGA wing. That slide into radical extremism means the party is contracting, but it is not clear at all that base voters will show up in the midterms without former president Trump on the ballot.<br /><br />Rallying voters with threats of “aliens” swamping traditional society is a common tactic of right-wing politicians; it was the central argument that brought Hungary’s Viktor Orbán into his current authoritarian position. Republican governors Greg Abbott of Texas and Doug Ducey of Arizona have been bussing migrants to Washington—about 10,000 of them—saying they would bring the immigrant issue to the doorsteps of Democrats. Now DeSantis is in on the trick.<br /><br />Immigrants are nothing new to northern cities, of course. The U.S. is in a period of high immigration. Currently, 15% of the inhabitants of Washington, D.C., are foreign born, only slightly less than the 16.8% of the population of Texas that is foreign born. About 29% of the inhabitants of Boston come from outside U.S. borders, as do 36% of the inhabitants of New York City. <br /><br />In the lead-up to the midterms, Republicans have tried to distract from their unpopular stands on abortion, contraception, marriage equality, and so on, by hammering on the idea that the Democrats have created “open borders”; that criminal immigrants are bringing in huge amounts of drugs, especially fentanyl; and that Biden is secretly flying undocumented immigrants into Republican states in the middle of the night. Beginning in July, they began to insist that the country is being “invaded.”<br /><br />In fact, the border is not “open.” Fences, surveillance technology, and about 20,000 Border Patrol agents make the border more secure than it has ever been. That means apprehensions of undocumented migrants are up, with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recording more than 3 million encounters at the border since January 2021. Those high numbers reflect people stopped from coming in and are artificially inflated because many who are stopped try again. CBP estimates that about 27% of those stopped at the border are repeat apprehensions. <br /><br />Although much fentanyl is being stopped, some is indeed coming in, but through official ports of entry in large trucks or cars, not on individual migrants, who statistically are far less likely than native-born Americans to commit crimes. And the federal government is not secretly flying anyone anywhere (although, ironically, DeSantis is); U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sometimes moves migrants between detention centers, and CBP transfers unaccompanied children to the Department of Health and Human Services. These flights have been going on for years. <br /><br />The second story is the history of American immigration, which is far more complicated and interesting than the current news stories suggest. <br /><br />Mexican immigration is nothing new; our western agribusinesses were built on migrant labor of Mexicans, Japanese, and poor whites, among others, in the late 19th century. From the time the current border was set in 1848 until the 1930s, people moved back and forth across it without restrictions. But in 1965, Congress passed the Hart-Celler Act, putting a cap on Latin American immigration for the first time. The cap was low: just 20,000, although 50,000 workers were coming annually.<br /><br />After 1965, workers continued to come as they always had, and to be employed, as always. But now their presence was illegal. In 1986, Congress tried to fix the problem by offering amnesty to 2.3 million Mexicans who were living in the U.S. and by cracking down on employers who hired undocumented workers. But rather than ending the problem of undocumented workers, the new law exacerbated it by beginning the process of militarizing the border. Until then, migrants into the United States had been offset by an equal number leaving at the end of the season. Once the border became heavily guarded, Mexican migrants refused to take the chance of leaving.<br /><br />Then, in the 1990s, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) flooded Mexico with U.S. corn and drove Mexican farmers to find work in the American Southeast. This immigration boom had passed by 2007, when the number of undocumented Mexicans living in the United States began to decline as more Mexicans left the U.S. than came. <br /><br />In 2013 a large majority of Americans, both Republicans and Democrats, backed a bill to fix the disconnect caused by the 1965 law. In 2013, with a bipartisan vote of 68–32, the Senate passed a bill giving a 13-year pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, who would have to meet security requirements. It required employers to verify that they were hiring legal workers. It created a visa system for unskilled workers, and it got rid of preference for family migration in favor of skill-based migration. And it strengthened border security. It would have passed the House, but House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) refused to bring it up for a vote, aware that the issue of immigration would rally Republican voters. </p><p>But most of the immigrants coming over the southern border now are not Mexican migrants.<br /><br />Beginning around 2014, people began to flee “warlike levels of violence” in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, coming to the U.S. for asylum. This is legal, although most come illegally, taking their chances with smugglers who collect fees to protect migrants on the Mexican side of the border and to get them into the U.S.<br /><br />The Obama administration tried to deter migrants by expanding the detention of families, and it made significant investments in Central America in an attempt to stabilize the region by expanding economic development and promoting security. The Trump administration emphasized deterrence. It cut off support to Central American countries, worked with authoritarians to try to stop regional gangs, drastically limited the number of refugees the U.S. would admit, and—infamously—deliberately separated children from their parents to deter would-be asylum seekers.<br /><br />The number of migrants to the U.S. dropped throughout Trump’s years in office. The Trump administration gutted immigration staff and facilities and then cut off immigration during the pandemic under Title 42, a public health order. <br /><br />The Biden administration coincided with the easing of the pandemic and catastrophic storms in Central America, leading migration to jump, but the administration continued to turn migrants back under Title 42 and resumed working with Central American countries to stem the violence that is sparking people to flee. (In nine months, the Trump administration expelled more than 400,000 people under Title 42; in Biden’s first 18 months, his administration expelled 1.7 million people.) <br /><br />The Biden administration sought to end Title 42 last May, but a lawsuit by Republican states led a federal judge in Louisiana to keep the policy in place. People arriving at the U.S. border have the right to apply for asylum even under Title 42.<br /><br />There are a lot of moving pieces in the immigration debate: migrants need safety, the U.S. needs workers, our immigrant-processing systems are understaffed, and our laws are outdated. They need real solutions, not political stunts.</p><p>—</p><p>Notes:</p><p>https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/01/texas-national-guard-border-operation-lone-star-abbott/</p><p>https://www.boston.gov/departments/immigrant-advancement/immigrant-demographics#:~:text=Boston%20is%20a%20welcoming%20City,has%20more%20than%20690%2C000%20residents.</p><p>https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-09-15/marthas-vineyard-migrants-ron-desantis</p><p>https://www.urban.org/stateofdcimmigrants</p><p>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/09/16/desantis-geographic-conflict-2024-election/</p><p>https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/TX/POP010210</p><p>https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/sep/06/surprising-number-americans-believe-these-false-cl/</p><p>https://www.axios.com/2022/09/15/desantis-marthas-vineyard-migrants-biden</p><p>https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/18/immigration-border-republicans/</p><p>https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/us-unauthorized-immigrant-population-2017/</p><p>https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/doesnt-add-up/sharetoken/lkQnyIQXsVFR</p><p>https://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/immigration-bill-2013-senate-passes-093530</p><p>https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2014/08/04/the-real-reason-why-the-house-wont-pass-comprehensive-immigration-reform/</p><p>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/title-42-immigration-border-biden-covid-19-cdc/</p><p>https://www.rescue.org/article/it-legal-cross-us-border-seek-asylum</p><p>https://www.wcvb.com/article/venezuelan-migrants-flown-to-marthas-vineyard-being-offered-shelter-support-on-cape-cod/41244254#</p><p>Share</p><p></p>",

        "description": "Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>“I’m not even supposed to be here today!”</p> Record: 68-76. Pace: 76-86. Change on 2021: +21.\n<p>Just after three o’clock this afternoon, the SnakePit mailing list dropped a plaintive little missive from Justin27, calling off his scheduled recap on the grounds of sickness. I suspect he may simply have been sick at the prospect of having to sit through another Madison Bumgarner start. Like a good managing editor, I stepped in to fill the gap, though will admit to having the game on mute, listening to our preferred 80’s DJ on Twitch, as per usual for Friday nights. I don’t feel like I lost much. No offense to Steve and Bob, but the thoroughly expected sight of balls whizzing out of the park really did not require much commentary. Let's start, for variety, with the comment of the game, which belongs to kilnborn</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>Never say we’re not on the nose. For Madison Bumgarner moved within one of the Diamondbacks single-season franchise record for losses tonight, with his fifteenth L of 2022. The last Arizona pitcher with more defeats was Rodrigo Lopez, who went 7-16 in 2010. He was earning only $650,000, so at least was economical. With only three starts left (unless the front-office decides to skip him again - which I'd not mind in the slightest), MadBum is probably more likely to set a new record with seventeen losses than get a win and reach /checks notes seven. He hasn't won since July, a stretch of nine starts over which Madison is 0-5 with an ERA of 5.00. </p>\n<p>This evening it was a series of batting-practise offerings which caught far too much of the plate.  The San Diego hitters gratefully accepted the charity, sending then into left-field bleachers with  enthusiasm. The opening salvo came courtesy of former D-back Brandon Drury, who continues to torment his old team this year. As if homering four times in six games with the Reds wasn't enough, he went deep with two outs in the first, giving the Padres a 2-0 lead, and then again to lead off the top of the fourth. He now has 27 home-runs on the season. Drury had a TOTAL of 31 across his three years with the D-backs. </p>\n<p>There was another solo shot in the middle of the Drurybombs, and the Padres used (relatively) small ball to add another tally in the fifth. Bumgarner's final line: five runs in five innings, on eight hits with a pair of strikeouts. Seven balls went in play at 100 mph or more. He didn't walk anyone, which is about the sole positive you can take away from tonight. With $37 million owed to Madison after this season, he is looking increasingly like a sunk cost through the end of 2024. The only question is, when the team will decide they have better starting options and yank him from the rotation and/or a roster spot. As Snake_Bitten mentioned in the GDT, Madison could follow the David Price route and become an insanely overpaid reliever.</p>\n<p>Approaching the end of his third season with Arizona, Bumgarner has a 14-29 record, an ERA above five and has been worth a total of 0.5 bWAR, less whatever comes off that for tonight’s outing. $48 million doesn't get you what it used to, does it? He was followed to the mound tonight by Keynan Middleton, the human white flag. We have lost 10 of his last 11 appearances - the exception being when he closed out a 7-0 win. Tonight, he showed why, allowing two runs on three hits. After a scoreless seventh, Ian Kennedy got lit up for four runs in the eighth. Though to be fair, he would have been out of the inning with half that, had Stone Garrett not botched an eminently catchable ball near the fence in left. </p>\n<p>I was hoping to see Mark Melancon, so we could complete the trifecta of poor free-agent pitcher signings. Instead, he was bailed out by Carson Kelly, who recorded the final out of the eighth. Amusing to see him head over to the umpire with his hands out for a sticky substance check, only for the ump apparently to go, \"Nah, fam - you're good.\" He came out for another inning of work in the ninth. Touching as high as 56 mph with his fastball, though Kelly did allow a home-run, his 6.75 ERA on the night is still better than that of Bumgarner,   Middleton or Kennedy. The last named is the only Arizona pitcher used tonight with an ERA for the season below five - and that only just, at 4.93. </p>\n<p>To copy-paste a line from my Monday recap. “You’ll notice I have not said a word about the Arizona offense. That’s because, as the score suggests, there is precious little to talk about.” It looked like they might get back into the game in the first, after Garrett doubled, and Emmanuel Rivera reached on an error. However, Garrett then got himself picked off second, and the rally deflated like a balloon at a porcupine convention. The exception the rest of the way was Christian Walker, who hit home-run #33 in the fourth inning, then added #34 in the ninth, a two-run shot. It’s still probably going to be a stretch to reach forty for the year, but never say never. </p>\n<p>Fun fact. Neither side issued a walk tonight. Arizona also had only two strikeouts, a combo the Diamondbacks had not surpassed for exactly eight years, to the day. This probably helps explain why the game took only 2:58, despite the sites combining for fifteen runs on twenty-four hits. </p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>Click for details at Fangraphs.com\n<br />Original: Christian Walker, +3.3%\n<br />Fifth-gen creased photocopy: Madison Bumgarner, -25.3%</p>\n<p>Bonus comment of the game from Jack Sommers (I’ll embed the image rather than the comment, because it’s easier to see). Note the positioning of the outfielders. :) </p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>kilnborn also asked at the end of the GDT, who was the last position player to get a win? The answer is John Baker for the Cubs in 2014 - he not just got the win on the mound, he scored the game-winning run. Anyway. Moving on, we’ll hope for MUCH better tomorrow, with Zac Gallen taking the mound for Arizona, in a 5:10 pm first pitch. </p>",

        "description": "<p>From Korea to Ukraine, a brilliant study of the politics and personalities that drive modern conflicts</p><p>There was a brief time, lasting from the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 to Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, when even quite sensible people wondered whether major wars might become a thing of the past. This proved to be ludicrously wrong, of course. Since the late 1990s our age has been largely defined by war, beginning with Chechnya and the former Yugoslavia and intensifying with 9/11 and the decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein. Now, after Vladimir Putin’s wholly unprovoked attack on Ukraine, we’re experiencing the scary feeling that nuclear war might be a real possibility, once again. And the Ukraine war is forcing us to ask the old, old question: whose finger is really on the trigger? Are the politicians or the generals in charge? The dictators or the duly elected representatives? The presidents and prime ministers or the people in uniform?</p><p>Prof Sir Lawrence Freedman is the dominant academic authority in Britain and the English-speaking world on the way modern wars have been fought. Rational, liberal-minded, clear-sighted, he has drawn on a lifetime of experience for his new book. It was, he accepts, a lockdown exercise. A purist might say some of the material could have been differently organised, with a clearer separation of the material by region, for example. But it is the quality of the narrative and the sheer intelligence of the judgment that count, given the subject’s vast sweep. Command takes in not simply the major wars – Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf and Afghanistan – but also France’s colonial wars in Indo-China and Algeria, the near-war created by the Cuban missile crisis, Pakistan’s hapless attempt to keep hold of Bangladesh, Israel’s disastrous invasion of Lebanon in 1982, the Falklands, and Laurent Kabila’s vicious campaign in the Congo: an often shameful yet always illuminating parade of hardware, human inadequacy and death.</p> Continue reading...",

Now 21, and five albums in, has the daughter of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith learned to live in the spotlight?</p><p>Eleven years ago, aged just 10 and a half, Willow Smith was done with being famous. Off the back of her breakout hit, Whip My Hair, a Rihanna-esque banger that played on repeat across playgrounds and dancefloors for weeks, she had landed a prestigious slot supporting Justin Bieber on tour.

My jaw nearly dislocated, dislodged, and shattered on the kitchen floor: my world-dominating, hair-whipping, future global superstar was totally bald.

        "description": "<p>Mat Bingham captures skylarks and meadow pipits against a backdrop of buttercup, Great Burnet, Saxifrage, Yellow Rattle and Bird’s-foot trefoil.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There is a sign next to the footpath that defines the Lammas Meadow as an ancient pasture which has been managed in the same way at least since 1762. The first cut of hay was historically taken after the 15th June and from the 1st August (Lammas Day) the meadow then grazed by cattle. The meadow is a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its varied wildflowers, is free of pesticides, and is a haven for ground-nesting birds such as skylarks and meadow pipits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a farm track that cuts across the meadow providing access to an adjoining field. In May and early June walking along this track flushes skylarks into the air like mayflies along a riverbank. The meadow also supports large numbers of meadow pipits, a similar bird in colouration to a skylark but without the crest and a bit smaller, robin-sized as opposed to the size of a starling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On still days the skylarks often sing from the ground, hidden away amongst the grasses and wildflowers. Parallel to the farm track is the remnants of a fence. If the wind gets up the skylarks prefer to sing from the top of the fence posts; this enables their song to be carried further across the meadow. On some windy days in spring, skylarks can occupy all the fence posts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before dawn, a single skylark starts to sing, which seems to wake others from their slumber, resulting in more and more skylarks joining the dawn chorus. Initially they don’t ascend, they sing hidden away in their overnight roosts. This is just the prelude to what will happen later. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the sun has chased the shadows from the meadow, first one skylark takes to the wing, then another and another until there are skylarks ascending across the whole meadow. This initial excitement dies down after about an hour or so, the ascents becoming much more sporadic as the day progresses. The displays can stop altogether if the weather becomes cold and damp or during the mid-day sun on particularly hot days.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It’s strange that even as the skylarks ascend higher and higher their song doesn’t seem to diminish in volume. Merely a speck in the distance, they drift high above like gossamer, yet their song can be heard clearly.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many skylarks in the meadow that as they parachute earthwards at the end of a display, it is inevitable that they drift over each other’s nests. The natural instinct to defend their patch of meadow during the breeding season kicks in and the descending bird flushes skylarks into the air that give chase across the meadow until it finally manages to locate its own nest.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of meadow pipits also nesting in the site, cousins of the skylark; they must have lived together in the meadow for a long time, as they seem to mimic the skylark’s behaviour. When the skylarks start to sing at dawn it encourages the meadow pipits to join in. They also ascend whilst singing but then, as if suddenly realising they are not skylarks, they abandon their song and dive for cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meadow pipits will also sit and sing from the fence posts but are often chased away by their bigger cousins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May there is a eruption of buttercups across the meadow followed, as spring progresses, by more exotic wildflowers: Great Burnet, Saxifrage, Yellow Rattle and Common Bird’s-foot trefoil.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A female kestrel gives chase to a skylark, but the lark jinxes left then right, easily avoiding her outstretched talons. It’s not long before the raptor gives up and resumes her position on a hawthorn bordering the meadow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The meadow supports substantial numbers of meadow brown butterflies and banded demoiselle damselflies, which form the staple food for the growing skylark chicks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As spring rolls into summer the bird biomass increases in the meadow as more and more chicks fledge. And then one morning the meadow has been cut for hay, and the magic is over again for another year.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Ukraine has stopped publicly asking for high-end U.S. weapons such as Patriot air defense systems, F-16 fighter jets and Gray Eagle drones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But behind the scenes, the push hasn’t stopped for weapons that could turn the tide of the war. Kyiv’s just getting savvier about its requests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both sides are discussing whether to send all three items as long-term financing deals are being hammered out, according to advisers to the Ukrainian government, Pentagon officials and defense industry executives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hasn’t been a wallflower in calling out Western governments for the weapons his country needs to repel Russian invaders, and has demanded more artillery, rocket launchers and precision weapons, which the U.S. and Western allies eventually provided in large numbers this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there’s been a shift in recent weeks from loudly calling for air defense and fighter jets to quieter negotiations. The campaign to tone it down has been led by Zelenskyy’s advisers in Kyiv and key interlocutors in Washington, along with friendly advice from the Biden administration itself, which encouraged Kyiv to focus more intently on what it needs right now to push Russian forces out of entrenched positions in Ukraine’s east and south, the people said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The change from a public campaign to a private one came as advisers grew concerned that the requests for high-end weapons were a distraction from Kyiv’s more immediate battlefield needs and concerns that the asks were muddling their tightly-scripted message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For months after Russia’s full-scale invasion in late February, Ukrainian leaders asked for Patriot systems and other high-end technologies, putting them at the top of the wish lists sent to Washington and circulated in the press. But big-ticket items have been left off the latest requests for must-need weaponry, which have stuck to requesting more artillery shells and rockets for HIMARS rocket launchers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talks about eventually obtaining Patriots, F-16s and Gray Eagles at some point down the road continue at low levels, however, according to three industry sources and people who are in touch with the Kyiv government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concerns aren’t merely that the high-tech systems would be provocative to Moscow, but also that complex maintenance and support for the systems would challenge Ukraine in the middle of the war. In the case of Patriots, their relative scarcity makes supplying Ukraine a challenge. U.S. Army Patriot units are some of the most deployed units in the service, with allies across Europe, the Middle East and Pacific demanding the protection they provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a prioritization problem: existing NATO allies want these systems too. As more Eastern European countries ditch their older Russian or even Soviet-era aircraft, they’re looking to the U.S. to begin selling or financing F-16s for their own defense. Already, the delivery of 14 F-16s to Slovakia has been delayed a year — to 2024 — due to supply chain issues, and Taiwan remains high on the priority list for the jets and their spare parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these more complex systems — including the F-16s slated for retirement by the U.S. Air Force — “are likely to arrive after this conflict is over,” said a congressional staffer with knowledge of the discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the request for Patriot missile batteries, the U.S. has agreed to finance the sale of the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, or NASAMS, for Ukraine. Officials warn that Ukraine’s capacity to train on and put to use both systems at once would be limited, at best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The NASAMS and Patriot are different systems and you’re training the same air defenders so there’s only so much they can do,” the staffer said, who like others in this story spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks. “I think we’ll get there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pentagon recently awarded a $182 million contract to Raytheon Technologies, using Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funds, for NASAMS. The first two systems will be delivered within the next two months, the Pentagon said Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine’s blitz to capture Kharkiv and push Russian troops out of thousands of square miles of Ukrainian territory this month has played to Ukraine’s strengths — quick decision-making on the ground and the effective use of artillery and precision munitions guided in part by timely U.S. intelligence — while exposing Russian weaknesses in leadership and logistics that were evident in the Kremlin’s lunge toward Kyiv in February.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Ukrainian advances have been stunning, the war doesn’t appear to be close to winding down. Kyiv and the Kremlin have yet to engage in talks to end the conflict, while Ukraine appears intent on pressing its newfound advantages. Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, has shown no sign of backing down from his maximalist position to change the government of Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the artillery and armor-heavy fight continues in the east and south, Russian ballistic missiles continue to target civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, underscoring the need for more modern air defense systems than the handful of Russian-made S-300s Ukraine currently operates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get there eventually, U.S. officials continue to discuss whether to send the Patriots to Ukraine as part of a long-term strategy, the people said.Discussions about whether to send the system are in early stages at the Defense Department, and a final decision would be up to President Joe Biden. But the fact that officials are talking about such a move is a major shift from this spring, when U.S. officials rejected the idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the plan moves forward, it’s likely the U.S. would sign a contract with Raytheon to build additional systems for Kyiv, rather than transferring relatively rare — and heavily deployed — Patriot batteries in the U.S. inventory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Patriot system would be a significant boost in capability for the Ukrainians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patriot is a sophisticated, multi-mission system designed to shoot down fixed-wing aircraft, ballistic or cruise missiles. In addition to the United States, 17 countries operate the system, including Romania and Poland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a defensive weapon that would cause Russian pilots to “think twice” before attacking Ukrainian forces, said Tom Karako, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For it to be used in anger, you’ve got to have a Russian missile or a Russian aircraft that has done the escalating, has come into range,” Karako said. “I would say it’s deescalatory.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to Ukraine’s existing air and missile defense assets, Patriot is a much newer, longer-range system that would provide Kyiv a critical new capability against Russian attacks, Karako said. Slovakia in April sent Ukraine an old Soviet S-300 missile defense system. The NASAMS being sent by the U.S. can shoot down short-to medium-range missiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the U.S. decides to go the acquisition route, the Ukrainians would not expect delivery of the Patriots for years, a timeline similar to weapons the Biden administration announced in August as part of a $3 billion package that directly funds contracts with the U.S. defense industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The defense industry funding will go to the production of artillery rounds, mortar rounds, surface-to-air missile systems; a new counter-drone capability; additional drones; and 24 counter-battery radars. None of the equipment will arrive for months; some will take years. But officials say the investment will allow Ukraine to plan for its own future defense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked about sending Patriots and other new weapons to Ukraine, a DoD spokesperson said the department has “no new announcements to make at this time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Generally speaking, we are working around the clock to fulfill Ukraine’s priority security assistance requests, delivering weapons from U.S. stocks when they are available, and facilitating the delivery of weapons by Allies and partners when their systems better suit Ukraine’s needs,” said the spokesperson, Lt. Col. Garron Garn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patriot would be “less escalatory” than some other systems that are being considered, a DoD official said, including longer-range rockets such as the Army Tactical Missile System, an offensive weapon that can fly up to 190 miles and reach into Russian territory, and which the White House has said is not being considered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk of supplying the MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone has also been ongoing for months. The drones don’t appear any closer to heading overseas than they were this spring, when discussions first became public, though two advisers to the Ukrainian government told POLITICO that talks continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several concerns, including the potential loss of technology carried on the drone if Russians were to shoot them down, along with uneasiness within the U.S. Air Force — which is eager to retire its own fleet of Gray Eagles — should the systems prove more survivable on the modern battlefield than expected. The Air Force wants to move the money spent on the aging drones on other modernization priorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever more new technologies arrive, it has become clear that Ukraine will increasingly be flooded with NATO-standard equipment as older Russian stockpiles of everything from ammunition to spare parts dries up across Europe, putting Western donors in the position of donating — or selling — increasingly high-end equipment to Kyiv for decades to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>Artist Melodee Strong was nervous. With days to go before the start of Hispanic Heritage month, she was missing key elements for her exhibit at a northeast Minneapolis gallery. A series of pieces featuring her parents still needed mounting on light boxes that had yet to arrive. Still other art works were unfinished.  </p><p>“Right now I have currently, I think, 15 pieces in the show,” Strong said. “Hopefully I'll have a few more to add by the time it opens.”  </p><p>As she worked, Strong grew more confident. </p><p>“All the pieces are coming together,” she said.  </p><p>Strong is an illustrator by training and also known for her mural work, but for her new solo exhibit, titled “Lineas de Sangre” or “Bloodlines,” she created pieces ranging from textiles to painting. The exhibit will be Strong’s first solo show in over a decade.</p><p>\"To be responsible for an entire gallery space ... and curating your own work is always a challenge,” but it also allowed her to explore topics and themes personal to her.  </p><p>One of those topics is her identity as a \"Minneruvian” — her combination of Minnesotan and Peruvian.  </p>Artist Melodee Strong sits in her studio in Northeast Minneapolis Wednesday.Jacob Aloi | MPR News<p>“I was really looking at this sort of juxtaposition of these two very different cultures,” she said. “[I] talked about the bias and racism and ignorance that comes along with being Latino.”  </p><p>Strong, a middle school art teacher and instructor at several Twin Cities colleges, grew up in St. Francis, Minn. She said that her upbringing in that part of Minnesota did not give her the opportunity to understand her identity fully. Strong said growing up with a white standard of beauty influenced how she saw herself and remembers the racism her Peruvian mother faced.  </p><p>“My mom had to assimilate, not necessarily by choice, but by survival, and for her to gain or acquire that sort of so-called American dream,” Strong said.  </p><p>Strong’s mother steered Melodee and her sister toward assimilation, hoping it would make their lives easier in an English-speaking and predominately white community. The exhibit allowed her to explore more of her Peruvian heritage.  </p><p>“The last few months have really been me, reflecting, writing, collecting images, researching [and] reaching out to my Peruvian family to learn a little bit more about some of the things that I lack in my own heritage and knowing.”  </p><p>She also explored her Minnesotan side. She said that her mixed identity cannot be separated out.  </p><p>“I think they have to be together, because I wouldn't be who I am without my father, and I wouldn't be who I am without my mother,” Strong said. “I have to talk about both cultures. I mean, I was raised in Minnesota. That's why I identify as “Minneruvian,” because I am a diehard Minnesotan, I love my Vikings and my Lynx.”  </p>\"Minneruvian,\" a combination of Peruvian and Minnesotan, which Melodee Strong explores in \"Lineas de Sangre.\"Jacob Aloi | MPR News<p>Another element of the exhibit is her relationship with her family, and the trauma they experienced in different ways. She said that being able to talk about it through her art has helped in the healing process. </p><p>“I’ve been reflecting a lot about my upbringing and my family relationships,” she said, “There's been a lot of changes in some of those relationships ... I think the art [has] actually helped me with that.”  </p><p>Strong’s art will be on display at the Northeast Sculpture Gallery Factory. The exhibit opened Sept. 16 and runs through Oct. 15, with a scheduled artist talk on Oct. 7.  </p>",

Some new things I learned:</p>\n\n\n\tThe Shed, the in-house coffee shop, serves something called a “Saigon Dirty,” which is: two shots of espresso, condensed milk, cardamom syrup, over ice. It’s a nice departure from the everyday coffee.\n\tGo to the librarian pod at the back of the library, show your library card, and they will hand you an Xbox controller, headphones, TV remote, and an Xbox game or two of your choice; walk over to the nearby Game Room and go wild. Why this isn’t completely filled all the time, I do not know. I played a good 30 minutes of Super Monkey Ball. \n\tThe wifi, although it requires passing through an every-time-you-connect annoying disclaimer, is well-implemented, very fast, and works everywhere in the building and on its patios.\n\tThere are a lot of well-curated collections of books on stands surrounding the main librarian pod; I’ve found myself borrowing from them almost exclusively.\n\tA photo on your phone of your library card barcode scans just as well as the card itself. \n\n\n,",

        "description": "<p>﻿Eleven years ago I brought my car to Dave’s Service Centre for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>The garage was on St. Peters Road back then, in a building long-since-demolished.</p>\n\n<p>A year or two after that first visit—Dave had become my regular mechanic by that time—Dorothy joined him, running the front-of-house. Indeed, the move from St. Peter’s Road down to Belmont Street was precipitated by Dorthy’s insistence they find new space, after a concrete chunk of that original building fell off; she found the space on Belmont on Kijiji that same afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>Dave and Dorothy helped me keep my 2000 VW Jetta on the road for almost 20 years. Every year that the Jetta carried on, we celebrated; it became a joint project to see how long we could keep it on the road.</p>\n\n<p>When I purchased an electric car in 2019, I was afraid that I’d have to go elsewhere for service. But it turns out that the Kia Soul EV, mechanically, outside of the engine, is just a regular old Kia Soul. So I continue to take it to Dave and Dorothy for brakes, winter tires, yearly inspection.</p>\n\n<p>This summer, as I was picking up my car after a brake job, and chatting with Dave and Dorothy, as I often do, Dorothy mentioned that they were getting married this weekend.</p>\n\n<p>When I took Lisa‘s car back a few weeks later, Dorothy gave me an invitation to the wedding reception.</p>\n\n<p>Dave and Dorothy are exceptional people: kind, honest, resourceful, good at explaining complicated things. They’re good businesspeople because they care about building long term relationships with their customers; it comes naturally to them.</p>\n\n<p>So, of course, Lisa and I went to their wedding reception last night, down at the Merchantman. It was a great do: good food, friendly people, and a lot of love for Dorothy and Dave.</p>\n\n<p>This being PEI, it turns out that Lisa and Dorothy are cousins, through the Uigg and Vernon River MacLeods. There was much family-connection-making, and I felt like I’d unlocked a new level of Islanderhood by simple proximity.</p>\n\n<p>Congratulations to Dave and Dorothy on their wedding. I’ll be in for my MVI in a few weeks.</p>",

This almost always allows the Twin Otters that serve the airport to land into the wind. At high tide these runways are under the sea; flight times vary with the tide. Emergency flights occasionally operate at night from the airport, with vehicle lights used to illuminate the runway and reflective strips laid on to the beach.</p>\n\n\n<p>(via this entertaining video about visiting Britain’s westernmost bus stop)</p>",

HA Club Charlottetown Monday night classes start on Sept. 12, 7-9pm, Farringford House (The Haviland Club), Charlottetown. All levels of experience are welcome to attend. Must be 16 years of age and older. Book in advance with an email/payment to  lauriemurphy@marram.ca. Classes are $35 each or five for $150  - a $25 saving when paid in advance! Student showcases will be in October and December 2022.</p>\n\n\n<p>You should join us.</p>\n\n<p>Really, yes, you.</p>\n\n<p>Last fall I was freshly down in the dumps about a possible relationship that ended abruptly, and in a particularly “fuck it, what’s the worst thing that could happen” state of mind. Following an ad in The Buzz, I got on my bicycle, rode down to the Haviland Club, and was still 50-50 on whether I’d bolt as I made my way up the stairs.</p>\n\n<p>I am so, so glad I didn’t bolt.</p>\n\n<p>What I found at the top of the stairs was, in Laurie Murphy, a kind and patient teacher of the art of improv, a fantastic and finely-honed combination of pusher, puller, cajoler and supporter.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t the “you’re going to be made fun of” improv of your nightmares, this is the “you will grow as a person in ways that you never thought possible” kind of improv. </p>\n\n<p>And the art isn’t just a “theatre thing”: the months I spent last year guided me to insights about all manner of things in my everyday life: how to run better meetings, how to work better with colleagues, how to be a better parent, and, most important and world-changingly, put me in the right frame of mind, a month after the first fateful class, to enter into a romantic relationship that has improv’s “yes, and…” baked into its very core.</p>\n\n<p>You need not have any qualifications. You need never have done improv or anything like improv before. You don’t need to be a “jokey” person—indeed it’s likely better that you aren’t. </p>\n\n<p>What you will find next Monday, at the top of the same stairs that I ascended, is a dynamic merry band of friendly people engaged in a practice that, at its core, is about the exchange of gifts, a practice that is designed to make you look good and lift you up.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll also find me, welcoming you.</p>\n\n<p>Fuck it, what’s the worst thing that could happen.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This afternoon, while on a walk around the Dizzy Block with Olivia, I rented a curbside electric scooter from Epic Electric Scooters. It’s been years since electric scooters started to grace/pollute/block/enchant the streets of cities around the world; sometimes Charlottetown is early to adopt, sometimes late, and this was a case of the late.</p>\n\n<p>Via the Epic app (downloaded from the App Store in advance), I located two scooters parked in front of the Holman Grand hotel:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Each had a “one size adjusts to fit all” helmet, which was a must-have for me, as who knew what might befall me, who’d had only a bad skateboard experience 45 years ago to base my abilities on.</p>\n\n<p>Unlocking was as simple as scanning the QR code on the top of the scooter, waiting a second for it to be unlocked, and then taking off.</p>\n\n<p>It seems dangerous folly to unleash untrained, unexperienced newbies like me on the naked streets of Charlottetown, but that’s what ensued: I rode around the block, figuring out balance and acceleration as I went.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>My 3 minute and 42 second, 0.51 km ride cost me $2.15, which was, no argument, a worthwhile expenditure for experiencing what the to-do is about.</p>\n\n<p>On the upside: the learning curve was very low, and I didn’t feel at all like I was going to fall off; it was more standup paddle board than windsurfer in this regard. The ride was smooth, and mildly thrilling, and I can imagine that owning a scooter and zipping around town would be lots of fun.</p>\n\n<p>On the downside: it was challenging to make proper hand signals and maintain balance; the potholes of the Dizzy Block, while not epic in their depth, loomed a lot larger with the tiny scooter wheels under me; my credit card company flagged the rental charge as a possible fraud, and shut my card down until I acknowledged that the charge was indeed from me.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not certain where or whether electric scooters fit into the responsible climate-friendly transportation network of the future, but I’m happy we now have the chance to find out in a low barrier-to-entry local way.</p>",

Your in-library recourse is to ask a librarian to change your PIN for you (which you can change back later if you like).</p>\n\nPrinting from the Computers\n\n<p>You can print things on the photocopier/printer located near the Maker Space from any of the public computers. Do do this you sign in to the computer, print from any application as you normally would, logout, then visit the printer, click on “Release Print Jobs” on the computer beside it, enter your library card number, and select the jobs to “release” (which means “print”). You then make payment in the box beside the printer and your pages will print. They come out in a drawer that’s not immediately visible: you need to look in the slot on the lefthand side of the printer.</p>\n\n<p>One caveat: you will need to have bills or coins, as there is no provision for credit or debit payment, and there are no stored-value cards available. Copies and prints are 10 cents per page.</p>",

Or when I fail to be there for a friend, or let down my family. Or when I don’t exercise or take care of myself. I think there are lots more of those than the triumphant posts I put up.</p>\n\n<p>So let’s normalize failing, and give each other a little grace when it happens, and remember to congratulate people all the more for the good posts they put up!</p>\n\n\n<p>In this week’s The Quack, Dave writes:</p>\n\n\n<p>One tiny programming note: a few times over the years, I’ve had people say they’re glad to hear everything is OK with my family literally all the time, because they read about our lives in the Quack. And while I will say we are absolutely lucky and happy in many ways, I hope you don’t think the Quack reflects absolutely everything in our lives… and that we don’t have, like, problems. That was never the point of this newsletter. This isn’t my whole life in a newsletter. This is the collection of (mostly) lovely mundane things that makes life worth living. This is the cup of tea on the deck in a stolen moment with Erin. This is the sink I figured out how to fix myself. This is the glimpse of the sunrise before a busy day. This is the good stuff.</p>\n\n\n<p>So there’s owning-up-that-everything-isn’t-perfect in the air.</p>\n\n<p>My summer has been dreamy, by times. I’ve swum in the ocean more times than I can count. Enjoyed wonderful meals with family and with friends. I’m in love. The world is grand.</p>\n\n<p>My summer has been dreadful and hard and angry by times. Grief continues to raise its hand at inconvenient times. I’m discovering that I have so much to learn about how to thrive in a relationship. My daughter has meltdowns, and is worried and anxious a lot of the time, and supporting her, and finding supports for her, is a part-time job. The world sucks.</p>\n\n<p>Both stories are true. </p>",

It is a low-profile “decorator” light switch, but the profile is still enough that 50% of the time the pantry is open the bathroom light comes on. I seek a completely low-profile “flat” light switch that won’t suffer from this problem. Lots of chatting to staff in the electrical sections of home goods shops, and lots of Googling, have resulted in no luck. Anyone?</p>\n\nFlat USB Charger\n\n<p>Lisa has a couch with an electrical outlet behind it into which a USB charger is plugged. The USB charger is a brick that sticks out about three inches, meaning it pokes into the couch. I’m looking for a low-profile USB charger, one that sticks “across” rather than “out.” I’m thinking of something that would have the profile of a deck of playing cards, with the plug part on the flat part. Like if Flat Stanley was a USB charger. Anyone?</p>\n\nSet And Forget Shower Temperature Control\n\n<p>In sensible Europe the shower controls have separate controls for “flow” and “temperature,” meaning that one can set the temperature to a comfortable level, and then avoid the daily “get the water temperature right” dance. This is convenient and, in our household, would be a huge help, as regulating the temperature is currently beyond Olivia, and so this remains the one impediment to 100% showering independence for her. I’ve raised this with local plumbing shops and responses have ranged from “huh?!” to “that will require ripping your walls apart.” I’d like to easily drop in a replacement for an existing “pull out to turn on, swivel right and left to control temperature” control. Anyone?</p>",

        "description": "<p>Nimrods’ announced on Facebook this week that it’s closing its Stratford location:</p>\n\n\n<p>Hello!</p>\n\n<p>My name is Jesse and I co-own nimrods with my good friend Nigel and we have important news to tell you. Sunday September 4th will be the last day we are open at our Stratford location.</p>\n\n<p>The last two years have been a heck of a ride. The pace and the scope of this project demanded so much just to keep moving forward that we began to lose sight of the reasons why we started it in the first place. We set out to produce food we were proud of, to create great jobs, and to do some small amount of good in our community. I think many of you reading this know how challenging running a small business can be. I think many of you might know how hard restaurant work is, and I think pretty much all of you can think back to the personal and professional pressures the circumstances of the last few years has put on us all. Nigel and I have never begrudged any of the challenges we’ve faced, but we find ourselves now, further from our core goals, our ideals, and our very mission statement than ever before. We both believe fundamentally that something worth doing is worth doing right, so conversely, maybe when you believe you no longer have it in you to do the job the way it should be done, you should step aside. </p>\n\n<p>Many of you have driven by this little old used-to-be KFC countless times since we moved in. From the outside you could never see how loud we were laughing, the cartoons we were drawing on the walls, or memories we were making. In the last two years when the whole world felt a little less warm and a little less funny, I got through it with and because of all of you Nimrods reading this. And I wouldn’t rather pandemic with any other group of people. </p>\n\n<p>And to you, our community and customers, we’re going to miss you too. You have cheered and supported us. You’ve always shocked us with the care and quality of your feedback. And my Lord, the patience you’ve shown us even when we messed up. You have all shown me and my staff unending kindness. I can say from personal day-in-day-out experience that the spirit of community and gentle nature is alive and strong on our Island. </p>\n\n<p>You’ll still be able to drink and dine with us at our locations on the Charlottetown Marina, and who knows, maybe somewhere else in the not so distant future, but as for Stratford — you’ve got two weeks to get your fix PEI. Then it’s time for these little Nimrods to take off their aprons and Birkenstocks and raise up our delis in a final toast to our corner in Stratford. </p>\n\n<p>Cheers,<br />\nNigel &amp; Jesse</p>\n\n\n<p>After capturing the Stratford Nimrods’ website to the Wayback Machine, L-the-Younger and I went across the river for one last meal there. She had poutine, as is her habit, and I had the excellent vegan burger and a coffee slushie. As usual, it was good food, well-prepared, well-served by friendly people in a we-made-the-best-of-what-we-were-dealt old Kentucky Fried Chicken.</p>\n\n<p>The heart of lunch for me and L-the-Y, however, wasn’t so much the food as the Donkey Kong.</p>\n\n<p>“What’s Donkey Kong?”, she asked as it scrolled by on the NES-emulator installed table-side.</p>\n\n<p>I am not a video game aficionado nor nostalgist, but even I know that, when an 11 year old says ”What’s Donkey Kong?”, it is the obligation of we greybeards to rescue them.</p>\n\n<p>So we played Donkey Kong.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of Donkey Kong.</p>\n\n<p>In 2-player mode.</p>\n\n<p>And it was fun. </p>\n\n<p>A lot of fun.</p>\n\n<p>We ended up staying almost 90 minutes. Which can’t be good for turning tables in a quick-serve restaurant, but was certainly a joy for us, and a fitting swan-song for a place that, while I couldn’t claim “regular” status at, carved out a soft spot in my heart.</p>\n\n<p>You will be missed, Nimrods’.</p>\n\n<p>Bon voyage, weirdos.</p>",

The order took longer than predicted to arrive: I was given a 45 minute estimate, and after an hour it still hasn’t come. </p>\n<p>I called the restaurant, and was reassured that it would arrive in 5 to 10 minutes, as they were just waiting for a delivery driver. </p>\n<p>Sure enough, five minutes later the delivery was on my doorstep. </p>\n<p>With a $20 gift certificate attached. </p>\n<p>That’s a classy move, one that has me writing a “that’s a classy move” blog post rather than a “I’m so disappointed” one. </p>",

I had relocated to Prince Edward Island but I had not seriously looked for employment yet. Considering my options, I longed to recapture the tea business dream that I started in my previous life in North Carolina. But where and how to begin again? Someone suggested the Farmers’ Market. That was back in the spring of 2007. It seemed like a great way to get started – just one day a week!</p>\n\n<p>Olivia and I were regular customers of Katherine’s for years and years: she extended her iced tea season well into winter in part to accommodate us. </p>\n<p>She will be missed.

        "description": "<p>Echo and Pathu like long walks. I do like long walks with them. Usually, it isn't easy in Bangalore with lots of traffic. But here in Thrissur, they go for long walks on pretty roads.</p>\n\n\n\nWalking path that we take every day\n\n\nMy current laptop, an Asus Zenbook, is six years old this month. It was an average-spec laptop then and is still. But it has survived the travels and usage. It's my primary workhorse; I code, watch, read and write on that machine. I did upgrade the HD to 512GB SSD and RAM to 12GB (the max it can take). I have been using Ubuntu from day one. It is still doing very well. I have no intentions of changing. Currently, It shares some load with LC230. LC230 (Liberated ThinkPad X230) is usually used as my second machine while traveling. At HO, I remote login into it and do some processing. I added it to my HO and travel pack last year. I am saying all this because, with some care and upgrades, the modern average laptop + Linux combo can work for you for a long time. This is why my next laptop will be something like Framework.It was a busy week. I watched a bit of 19(1)(a), and it looks interesting. I will watch it again.Politically and historically, walks have been very powerful in bringing folks together in India. I can see that @RahulGandhi is gathering folks on the way. There will be a lot of distractions, but I hope they focus on the motto of unity and love. #BharatJodoYatraSlowly I am moving all my map data into GeoJSON format, stored inside a CouchDB database as a document. This makes it easy to manage it. There are some GPX tracks that I upload to WordPress directly. I rarely update GPX files. So it shouldn't be a problem. I use a simple yet powerful WordPress plugin called Leaflet Maps to display them here. I also use Extensions for Leaflet Map for additional functionality. Both are FOSS and also built on top of Leaflet. The fact that data is stored in a DB makes the possibility of reuse easy. Here is an example map of Travel Locations for Geeks In India.Titles of weekly posts are currently monotonous. Should I add a more descriptive title, say \"Weekly Notes 37/2022 - Thinking about e-waste\"? Sometimes I think it makes the title interesting, but other times, I think it unnecessarily highlights only a part of the week or forces me to highlight something. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You can read this blog using RSS Feed.

She used to get a lot of gifts from her students, flowers (especially roses), Cadburys five star, peacock feathers, Coffee Byte toffee, etc. She used to say government primary school kids are the best. Personally, teaching has been a fantastic experience for me. It has made me more empathetic.</p>\n\n\n\nI took a picture of this Traveller (such a good name) on our walking path. It's such a good reminder.\n\n\nI went to SFS English medium school for my high school. Till 7th standard I was in Kannada medium. It was a significant change in my life. I struggled quite a bit for a couple of months. I want to thank Ms Louise, my class teacher and social studies teacher in 8th standard. She was very nice to me, always saying positive stuff. Without her, I wouldn't be so confident in life. Thank you.Arranging Pookalam continued till the Onam. Here is the album containing all ten Pookalams. Anju has put a lot of time and effort into it. They look amazing. Maybe I should get them printed. \n\n\n\nWatching Mokapot make Coffee\n\n\n\nMy Mokapot from Bialetti arrived. They are available on your regular e-commerce sites, but it takes time to get delivered. It's much faster than Aeropress to use it, especially when you want to make coffee for a bunch of people. I have been brewing Loris from Black Baza Coffee. People love it here. Though I think they might like a medium roasted coffee more—next time. We launched an MVP at Peppo in 6 weeks. I am very proud of the team that was able to do it. I will write more later. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You can read this blog using RSS Feed.

I will post the entire gallery at the end. You can see day one's Pookalam above.Met a bunch of IITM students at IISc on Friday as part of the meetup. We had a long conversation about application development, ethics in software engineering, the Indian constitution, etc. Post-meetup conversations are usually better than the meetup themselves. \n\n\n\nWeather has been great\n\n\n\nThe last few days have been hectic settling down here, especially for Echo. We are doing okay now. But Pathu, on the other hand, has already made new friends. \n\n\n\nPathu's favorite pass time is to watch people.\n\n\n\nI continue to find use-cases for self-hosted ntfy push notifications and a simple self-hosted pub/sub system. I will blog more about it. I also updated the graphs and data of IDVC with some more data points. It is semiautomatic now. I will need to integrate with Kobo's webhook system to automate it fully. I will do it at some point. But for now, not so real-time graph updates work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You can read this blog using RSS Feed.

Now, we have 757 districts in India. I updated my list and the mapping to WikidataId.I am trying FreeBSD inside QEMU on my Ubuntu tpx. This is my first time on BSD systems. I want to see how it goes. Since tpx has old (as per industry standards) hardware, I am guessing there won't be compatibility issues. There could be issues with application software. I will report here about my time as a developer on FreeBSD.Wrote a blog post about setting up a remote desktop system using xrdp and Reminna on Ubuntu. This is useful if you want desktop access on a shared computer.  Self-hosted ntfy push notification system built on top of web technologies. It works like magic. So on my desktop and on my LineageOS, I can now get push notifications without the big two involved. Also, ntfy works well with the UnifiedPush notification system. We will be in Thrissur for the next three weeks. We will work from there. Slowly Thrissur is becoming my second HO. \n\n\n\nContested Nation Podcast\n\n\nPodcast Contested Nation was launched today by the Team Equals Project. I just heard the first episode.

        "description": "<p>I am slowly moving to LineageOS on my personal phone. The most important features I use on that phone are Email, Messaging, Mapping, and Alerts. I have found decent alternatives for Email, Messaging, and Mapping. Alerts or Notifications are something I depend on a lot; currently, they are Google or Apple features. I could settle down for pulls (I get a few alerts by way of RSS feeds), but push would be great. Especially for alerts from my home or servers. Hence was looking for it. NTFY suited my needs from all angles. Therefore I took some time to deploy it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNTFY\n\n\n\n<p>When I was looking for a solution, five primary factors were</p>\n\n\n\nBased on Open Web StandardsFree and Open Source SoftwareSelf hostableAuth and RBAC possibleAndroid and other clients\n\n\n\n<p>ntfy did satisfy all those conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ntfy (pronounce: notify) is a simple HTTP-based pub-sub notification service. It allows you to send notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts from any computer, entirely without signup, cost or setup. It's also open source if you want to run your own. </p>ntfy website\n\n\n\n<p>When you are running a service like this on Android, power consumption can become as an issue. But I have been running it for a week now with Instant Delivery (foreground service) switched on. Battery consumption has been negligible. Delivery has been on time and stable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, I am running a self-hosted version using Docker. I have a few channels subscribed on a browser, a few Android phones, and desktops (CLI). It's been stable and working as expected.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNtfy notification with image and action button.\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHosting\n\n\n\n<p>My initial idea was to run the docker instance on cloud run, but billing is complicated for WebSockets on it. The next choice was AWS lightsail or one of my DO machines. But finally, I settled for Fly; it looked effortless and cheap to run such a machine on Fly. And it has been. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option was to deploy it on my internal machine. But I didn't want to open a port to it from outside. The only option was to connect to it using a VPN, limiting its usage. It's a duct-tape system connecting many things. So it makes sense to be available on the public internet.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I created a docker file and a new server.yml file for my server configuration. Added paths to my cache and auth SQLite databases. The path /data is mapped to a volume. So data gets saved even if the Docker is restarted.</p>\n\n\n\nFROM binwiederhier/ntfy\nCOPY server.yml /etc/ntfy/server.yml\nENTRYPOINT [\"ntfy\", \"serve\"]\n\n\n\n<p>server.yml looks like this</p>\n\n\n\nbase-url: \"https://&lt;your_app&gt;.fly.dev\"\nlisten-http: \":80\"\ncache-file: \"/data/cache.db\"\nattachment-cache-dir: \"/data/attachments/\"\nauth-file: \"/data/user.db\"\nauth-default-access: \"deny-all\"\n\n\n\n<p>Once deployed. I logged into the system, created users, and added access. </p>\n\n\n\nntfy web app\n\n\n\nPowerful\n\n\n\n<p>ntfy on the top looks like a very simple service. But it's a simple and compelling pub/sub service with an excellent predefined message format and clients. I use their JSON message format with POST and Authorization header. That way, if I want to save a topic in the future, I can directly pipe it to a CouchDB. The message and Android provide a lot of wiring features.</p>\n\n\n\nSupports click action - where you can open the URL by clicking the message. Useful if you are sharing links between machines.You can add actions like View a URL or  Open an App. These actions are visible as a button that you can click to continue with the action. For example, email client app using mailto:// or open map using geo:// etc.You can also tie it to HTTP request to send further requests. Imagine one-time use capability URLs sent as part of message. I generally use HTTP Shortcut App for that and shortcuts:// as a link works. You can also broadcast the message so other apps can capture and consume it. Works well with tasker or macrodroid apps. This can be used to automate things.Can carry attachments (directly attached or as URL) as part of the messageIt supports UnifiedPush\n\n\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n\n<p>I have not configured email delivery yet. I am working on that. I will enable it. This way the most important messages from my home can be delivered both on ntfy app and on my regular email client.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: There is a hosted service at ntfy.sh, try it first before jumping into self-hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You can read this blog using RSS Feed.

        "description": "<p>I use my tpx as a travel machine1; at home, it's mainly used remotely. As in, I connect to it either through ssh or through a remote desktop and work on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted RDP and not VNC, mostly because I want to have a session on the remote desktop with the same profile etc. And also allow others to log in using their profile. Somewhat akin to SSH logins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>VNC is targeted towards sharing screens. Everyone who has logged in will see the same screen and account. This means all the logged-in users operate on the same things simultaneously. It's fantastic when you want to debug someone's computer but not when you want to work on a remote computer, especially if it's shared. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So run the RDP server on your Ubuntu machine, and you will need to install xrdp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>xrdp provides a graphical login to remote machines using Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). xrdp accepts connections from a variety of RDP clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can just apt install it on Ubuntu. Once you install, enable the service so it can start on boot. You can also edit the following configuration files.</p>\n\n\n\n/etc/xrdp/sesman.in/etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini\n\n\n\n<p>to match your requirements. For example, if you want to change the port, security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you start the server on the machine, you can connect to it from any client machine if it's reachable on the network. Mine is accessible only on the local network. Hence can connect only if the clients are also on the same network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remmina is a FOSS remote desktop client software. It can be used to connect to remote machines using various protocols. RDP, VNC, SPICE, NX, XDMCP, SSH, and WWW are currently supported. It also has a plugin system to support additional protocols and features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can install Remonna on Ubuntu by the standard apt-get way or use flatpak. I use Remmina on all my client machines to connect to servers. In this case, I use it as an RDP client. And it works.</p>\n\n\n\nxrdp login page\n\n\n\nUbuntu Home\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose you are away from home and want to RDP to a machine at home. Then the best option is VPN. You can use VPN to connect to the home network and then RDP to the machine. Since you are on a VPN, you are on the same network.</p>\n\n\n LC230 or Liberated Computer x230 from Mostly Harmless.

        "description": "Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Giants in play for Judge; Sevy back next week; Dominguez headed to AZL; new bylines for Esteban</p> <p>NJ.com | Mike Rosenstein: Long-rumored to be one of the main suitors for Aaron Judge this winter, the Giants didn’t exactly throw their hat in the ring yesterday, but the club’s president Farhan Zaidi confirmed that San Fran will be big spenders in the winter, as they attempt to claw back from a bad 2022. Zaidi stopped short of mentioning Judge, or any specific names at all, but they’re definitely a club that could be a fit.</p>\n<p>Sports Illustrated | Gary Phillips: The Yankees were devastated by injuries in August, but seem to be on the path to recovery. Aroldis Chapman was activated ahead of Friday’s game with the Brewers, and Luis Severino is lined up for a start Wednesday night against Boston. He pitched into the fifth inning in his final rehab outing Thursday night, and whatever role he fills for the Yankees down the stretch, gives them another powerful weapon on the mound.</p>\n<p>MLB.com | Jim Callis, Jonathan Mayo &amp; Sam Dykstra: With the MiLB season wrapping up, top prospects are preparing for the Arizona Fall League. The league kicks off October 3, with Jasson Domínguez highlighting the Yankee contingent after his explosive run at High-A. Leam Mendez, a hard-throwing righty, will also be part of the Yankee crew playing for Mesa.</p>\n<p>FanGraphs | Meg Rowley: Our last piece of news is site-centric, as our own Esteban Rivera was hired as one of FG’s newest contributors. It’s been a joy to work with him for the past year, and we’re fortunate that he will stay on at PSA while taking on the additional work. No doubt his first piece will be defending the Washed, Six-Win Mike Trout.</p>",

        "description": "Photographs by Daniel Katzive.\n<p>By Daniel Katzive</p>\n<p>A huge mass of what looked like white blocks made its way up the Hudson River Friday afternoon, passing Riverside Park as the tide came. West Side Rag reader Joel Bernstein reached out to report there seemed to have been a major discharge of styrofoam into the river.</p>\n<p>On closer examination, West Side Rag found it was not styrofoam at all, but rather chunks of foam that easily broke up when fished out of the water with a stick.</p>\n<p>Contacted via Twitter, the Riverkeeper organization told WSR that its patrol boat captain John Lipscomb looked at our photos but had been unable to determine what it was. Riverkeeper told us though that on a previous occasion where similar foam chunks had been detected near the George Washington Bridge, the substance had been traced back to fire fighting exercises onshore that had allowed foam to escape into the river via storm drains. They emphasized that there could be numerous reasons for the foam blocks and cannot speculate on what is causing this particular occurrence.</p>\n<p>WSR has also reached out to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and this article will be updated if the agency is able to provide any further information.</p>\n<p>Riverkeeper says members of the public can directly report unusual conditions they observe along the river on the Riverkeeper website: https://www.riverkeeper.org/get-involved/violations/</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Turkish Foreign Ministry on Saturday “strongly” condemned the U.S.’s announcement that it will widen the scope of its 2020 decision to lift its arms embargo on Cyprus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move is “in contradiction to the principle of equality of the two sides on the island,” the ministry said in a statement. The development will “further strengthen the Greek Cypriot side’s intransigence, will negatively affect the efforts to resettle the Cyprus issue; and it will lead to an arms race on the island, harming peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean,” the ministry added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It called on the U.S. to reconsider the decision and “pursue a balanced policy towards the two sides on the island.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The northern third of the island has been occupied by Turkey since 1974. The U.S. imposed the arms embargo in 1987 to encourage the island’s reunification, and partially lifted it in September 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. State Department on Friday said Cyprus had “met the necessary conditions under relevant legislation to allow the approval of exports, re-exports, and transfers of defense articles to the Republic of Cyprus for fiscal year 2023.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades on Twitter welcomed the U.S. announcement as a “landmark decision, reflecting the burgeoning strategic relationship between the two countries, including in the area of security.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Turkish ministry said it will “continue to take necessary steps for the existence, security and serenity of the Turkish Cypriots, by all means.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>“The first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish … the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for, nor trying to turn it into, something that is alien to its nature,” Carl von Clausewitz wrote in his landmark treatise On War. “This is the first of all strategic questions and the most comprehensive.” The leaders of Ukraine and Russia have set simple, and wholly incompatible, goals in their current war: Volodymyr Zelensky has made clear that Ukraine is fighting for its freedom, and Vladimir Putin has made clear that Russia is fighting to destroy Ukrainian independence.</p><p>Right now, the Ukrainians seem most likely to get what they want. And the United States shouldn’t fear the consequences of their victory.</p><p>[Anne Applebaum: It’s time to prepare for a Ukrainian victory]</p><p>Zelensky has been indefatigable in communicating his aims, both domestically and internationally. Domestically, the government has worked to connect the war to its human toll on Ukrainians. He grieves at the Bucha massacre, frets about the collapse of the Ukrainian economy, celebrates Ukrainian civil society, and somberly honors the military.</p><p>When lionized for Ukraine’s putting up an unexpectedly stiff resistance to Russian aggression, Zelensky implored the international community to understand that all Ukraine wants is peace. “I don’t want them destroyed—I want them all to remain.” More than 200 days after Russia invaded, he sounded equally focused on the survival of his people when he spoke to a group I was with in Kyiv this week: “The people are the only treasure we have.”</p><p>He has succeeded in bolstering Ukrainians’ hopes: 97 percent believe that Ukraine will definitely or likely win the war, and 40 percent favor no concessions of any kind to end the war. Ukrainians believe they are fighting for the fundamental values of a free society: human dignity, political liberty, national security. Those beliefs have electrified the society, which is engaged in impressive civic activism in support of the defense effort—something that will be studied by Western countries as mastery of 21st-century warfare.</p><p>Clausewitz also wrote that “the moral elements are among the most important in war. They constitute the spirit that permeates war as a whole.” Ukraine’s war has those moral elements, and they are generating societal resilience and garnering international support; Russia’s war does not, and that will doom it. Russia likely cannot recover from its strategic mistakes or generate the resources to achieve its war aims, especially because its leadership remains obdurate and its military forces are failing to adapt.</p><p>Ukrainian staying power is, naturally, changing the Russian approach. Putin initially believed Ukraine was so riddled with corruption and Russian supporters that a “special military operation” could parachute into the capitol and effect a regime change. He sent ground forces streaming in along three axes in the east and south to add insult to injury. Although the Russian military has targeted civilian populations from the start, it has shifted dramatically in that cruel direction as its invasion falters and is driven back. As Russia’s failures on the battlefield mount, it will lose its military effectiveness—which will further shift the Russian way of war from fighting an army to punishing civilians it could not conquer.</p><p>Could the Russians escalate more, and more wildly? Yes, absolutely. The possibility of Russia using a nuclear weapon on Kyiv as Russia’s military is forced to retreat is discussed frequently in policy circles in Kyiv. But I heard no variation on the conclusion by Ukrainians that it would change only the cost, not the outcome, of the war. Russia is already purposely inflicting civilian casualties indiscriminately and in large numbers.</p><p>[Phillips Payson O’Brien: Ukraine pulled off a masterstroke]</p><p>As Ukrainians defend their country, you can see what Abraham Lincoln called “the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.” You see it in graffiti reading more Europe, less war on the sides of destroyed apartment buildings. You hear it in mayors anxiously describing large-scale evacuations and the challenges of refugee resettlement. It emanates from the sober assessments of their military planners explaining what has been achieved but all that remains to be done. It rests in the mutual respect evident between the military and their civilian leadership, and Ukrainians’ affection for their military.</p><p>Some fear a “catastrophic victory” for Ukraine that humiliates Putin, thereby risking escalation against Ukraine or attacks on the U.S. and its NATO allies. But Russia isn’t winning a war against Ukraine, and it can’t win a war against us. We’re the strong ones in this conflict, and we deter more effectively when we act with confidence on that knowledge.</p><p>As we begin to think about a postwar Ukraine, we should not let the failures of prewar Ukraine shackle our thinking about who Ukrainians are and what they are capable of. They deserve our continued, increased help to win their war and reconstruct their country within the confines of the West.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Enlarge / Kate Beaton (credit: Corey Katz / Kate Beaton)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For those who paid attention to the webcomics scene of the 2010s or simply enjoy good humor writing, the name Kate Beaton is likely a familiar one. The Canadian cartoonist’s Hark a Vagrant—a dizzying mix of the literary and historical references, lack of respect for institutions that didn’t deserve any, and gleeful silliness that ran through 2018—was a staple of Best Of lists for years, whether online or in its two print collections.</p>\n<p>Outside of that work, Beaton has created kids’ books (The Princess and the Pony and King Baby, which both won awards) and earlier this year an animated series based on one of those books: Pinecone &amp; Pony on Apple TV+.</p>\n<p>This week her latest project hits shelves, and it’s arguably her greatest achievement to date. Ducks: Two Years in the Oil Sands is a memoir of her experiences working in the Athabasca oil sands in northern Alberta. It’s a serious, moving, and heartfelt piece of cartooning that is as kind as it is fearless and easily one of the most impressive graphic novels of this year, or works of any kind in the past decade.</p><p>Read 27 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

The sky above changes from morning scarlet to blue-white-grey to streaks of pink-orange, before twilight brings inky-velvet blues and blacks, with swooping bats and haunting owls.</p><p>In the bright daytime, screeching buzzards soar, while before me the oystercatchers squeak with excitement as they forage the shoreline for cockles and mussels with their orange-red bills. Ahead is the restless but constant rolling water of the waves, as they claw and grasp away at the shore, only to return it rearranged. To the side of me trickles and tickles a tiny stream, meandering its way to the vast deep blue, playing its part in the endless aquatic cycle.</p> Continue reading...",

The Dartmouth Food Festival, which takes place on the waterfront, boasts chefs and speakers including Matt Tebbutt, Prof Tim Spector and … ahem, yours truly. And once you’ve sampled your way around the many stalls, tasting events and workshops, you’re well placed for the area’s other edible attractions, including South Devon Chilli Farm, with its display tunnel and shop, the Manna from Devon wood-fired cookery school, and Riverford Field Kitchen (lunch from £29.50), as well as the Sandridge Barton vineyard. Notable restaurants include Mitch Tonks’s Seahorse (mains about £30) and, down the coast, Hope Cove House (mains about £16) and Jane Baxter’s Wild Artichokes in Kingsbridge (feasting menu £45). Or you could just get takeaway fish and chips (£9.95) from Tonks’s Rockfish and sit on the harbour wall.

        "description": "<p>Enlarge / Kate Beaton (credit: Corey Katz / Kate Beaton)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For those who paid attention to the webcomics scene of the 2010s or simply enjoy good humor writing, the name Kate Beaton is likely a familiar one. The Canadian cartoonist’s Hark a Vagrant—a dizzying mix of the literary and historical references, lack of respect for institutions that didn’t deserve any, and gleeful silliness that ran through 2018—was a staple of Best Of lists for years, whether online or in its two print collections.</p>\n<p>Outside of that work, Beaton has created kids’ books (The Princess and the Pony and King Baby, which both won awards) and earlier this year an animated series based on one of those books: Pinecone &amp; Pony on Apple TV+.</p>\n<p>This week her latest project hits shelves, and it’s arguably her greatest achievement to date. Ducks: Two Years in the Oil Sands is a memoir of her experiences working in the Athabasca oil sands in northern Alberta. It’s a serious, moving, and heartfelt piece of cartooning that is as kind as it is fearless and easily one of the most impressive graphic novels of this year, or works of any kind in the past decade.</p><p>Read 27 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

        "description": "<p>Former President Trump won a significant victory over investigators Thursday. If it stands, it will slow to a crawl the probe into how sensitive documents at Mar-a-Lago were handled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless an appeal filed by the government on Friday succeeds, major action in the probe now seems all but certain to be postponed past the midterm elections — by which time Trump might plausibly declare himself a 2024 presidential candidate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that scenario, he can be expected to argue with even more gusto that he is being victimized for political reasons by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and FBI. At a recent rally in Pennsylvania, Trump labeled the two organizations “vicious monsters.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The win for Trump came when Judge Aileen Cannon announced Thursday that she would appoint Raymond Dearie, a semi-retired judge proposed by Trump’s legal team, as a so-called special master in the case that first burst into public view with the Aug. 8 FBI raid on the former president’s Florida club.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannon, herself a Trump appointee, favored the former president in other important ways, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The typical role of a special master is to evaluate documents seized in a law enforcement raid to see if any might be privileged attorney-client communications — or private and without evidentiary worth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannon held that Dearie could evaluate all the documents seized, including those marked classified, for this purpose. Around 11,000 documents were taken in the raid, with about 100 bearing classified markings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The government has argued — including in its Friday appeal — that, even if Cannon insists on going ahead with the appointment of a special master, documents with classified markings should be exempt from the process. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In essence, the government asserts that such documents cannot, by their nature, be Trump’s personal property and are self-evidently germane to the investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But “the Court does not find it appropriate to accept the Government’s conclusion on these important and disputed issues without further review by a neutral third party in an expedited and orderly fashion,” Cannon wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving forward, there are two other crucial aspects to Cannon’s latest decision. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, she has given the special master until Nov. 30 to complete his work, clogging some lines of investigation for at least six weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, Cannon held fast to a controversial view. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She asserts that it is possible to pause the use of the seized documents in a criminal probe, pending Dearie’s review, while at the same time proceeding with a separate process that would evaluate whether national security interests might be threatened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Media reports have suggested that at least one seized document refers to a foreign nation’s nuclear capabilities. Several were categorized as “TS/SCI,” an abbreviation that stands for “Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannon took an undisguised jab at investigators in her Thursday decision, noting that the main national security jeopardy in the case so far emanates from “the unwarranted disclosures [in] leaks to the media after the underlying seizure.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The government had argued that the two strands being probed — national security implications and possible criminality — cannot be separated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the DOJ does not prevail in its appeal, legal experts say investigators face significant problems. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investigators cannot for now use the content of any of the seized documents in interviews with potential witnesses. In practical terms, that would seriously neuter the probe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“How does one investigate issues relating to those documents from an intel standpoint if you still can’t share the contents?” said Mark Zaid, a D.C.-based attorney who specializes in cases related to national security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The first question, let’s say to a member of staff at Mar-a-Lago, might be, ‘Where did you see the classified document?’ And they say, ‘Which one?’ And the answer is, ‘We can’t tell you.’ The FBI runs out of steam within two questions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zaid noted, however, that this does not necessarily remove all legal jeopardy faced by Trump or those close to him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous filings have shown that one of the potential crimes being investigated is obstruction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A case could be made that such a crime had taken place, without reference to the actual contents of the documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chronology of events leading up and including the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago suggests that Trump and the people around him were subpoenaed to produce all documents bearing classified markings and said they had done so, when in fact they had not. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That could be seen as evidence of a crime, regardless of the specifics of what the documents contain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the real world, however, the DOJ might be reluctant to indict a former president at that stage when it might otherwise wait for the special master’s review to conclude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, some legal observers are pushing back hard against Cannon's decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Judge Cannon wasn't simply leaning in Trump's direction but falling at his feet,\" said Harry Litman, a former U.S. Attorney and Deputy Assistant Attorney General.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dearie has directed counsel for the respective sides to appear in a federal courthouse in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Tuesday for a “preliminary conference.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Complicating matters further, Cannon has permitted Dearie to evaluate the documents for whether Trump might justifiably exert executive privilege — not merely attorney-client privilege — over any of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nuances of the legal arguments don’t disguise the underlying realities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Trump-appointed judge has placed a significant speed-bump in the way of the investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The obstacle may be cleared on appeal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it is not, prosecutors face a frustratingly slow road ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Republicans are squabbling over policy and messaging surrounding abortion amid mounting evidence that the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade is hurting the GOP ahead of midterms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most Republicans supported overturning Roe v. Wade, and the number of pro-abortion rights Republicans in Congress is dwindling. But GOP lawmakers disagree on the next move to make, and many think legislation calling for strict bans on abortion will only compound their problems. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Legislation introduced this week to impose a nationwide abortion ban after 15 weeks of gestation, with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother, highlighted fissures in the party over the issue.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many party members would prefer to steer the national conversation toward soaring inflation and an economy that could be headed toward a recession rather than abortion restrictions 50 days before the midterms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) said that while he has supported a 15-week ban in Nebraska, he had heard pushback to the federal bill for taking the focus away from economic issues — an argument where Republicans have seen success.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The average family has had a pay raise of 4 percent, but yet inflation for food is, like, 13 percent. That's what we should be talking about. So that's probably the main pushback,” Bacon said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is unlikely that any major anti-abortion legislation could make it out of the next Congress because of the Senate’s 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) led the “Protecting Pain-Capable Unborn Children from Late-Term Abortions Act” in the Senate, and a House version was introduced by Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), a decades-long advocate against abortion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about critics who say that the height of the midterm season is the wrong time to introduce this kind of bill, Smith said: “There's never the right time.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It is the time to draw a contrast,” Smith added, to Democratic legislation that he said would “eviscerate every modest pro-life policy enacted over 50 years — women's right to know laws, waiting periods, parental notification statutes.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graham also argued in a press conference on Tuesday that the bill offered an alternative to Democratic legislation to codify abortion rights that he said went too far.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A core part of the GOP response to Roe v. Wade’s fall is trying to redirect attention on Democrats and paint them as having extreme positions on abortion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A messaging memo that the Republican National Committee sent to candidates this week asserted that a majority of voters disagree with allowing abortion at any time in pregnancy and for any reason.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Go on offense, explain how it is your opponent who has no exceptions to their abortion position,” it advised. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not all Republicans agree with taking federal action on abortion, which can put the GOP back on the defense. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) threw cold water on Graham’s bill, saying that “most of the members of my conference prefer this be dealt with at the state level.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, some anti-abortion advocates saw Graham’s bill as a middle ground Republicans could rally around, taking the focus away from Republican-led states that have near-total bans and make little exceptions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), who has been vocal in supporting such exceptions due in part to her own experience with sexual assault, said that she appreciated the exceptions in the bill. But she took issue with some of the details. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill requires that abortions on minors past 15 weeks could only be performed if the rape had been reported to a government agency authorized to act on reports of child abuse, or law enforcement agency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“That gives me some heartburn, because one of the reasons that women don't come forward with this abuse and the sexual trauma and sexual assault and rape that they've been through, is because of what happens when people find out the way that they're attacked for it,” Mace said.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And I know this firsthand, because when I told my story, you should have seen the way that people commented about, the way that I was treated by even my own colleagues in the state legislature. It was disgusting.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pushback to the bill has also come from the political right. Staunch conservatives have said that they are unwilling appear as if they’re compromising on their anti-abortion stance.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you're a representative for a district in a state that has more restrictive abortion laws than 15 weeks, you wouldn't be for that,” said Rep. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smith, the lead sponsor of the House bill, said concerns from colleagues that the bill might override stricter abortion bans in states are a misconception. He stressed that is not the case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it would preempt abortion rights laws in states like New York and California, it would not override Ohio’s 6-week ban or near-total bans in other states. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There are at least 55,000 abortions every year at 15 weeks or beyond. And that is a huge loss of life,” Smith said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 15-week bill is an updated version of 20-week abortion ban legislation that previously passed in Republican-controlled Houses in 2013, 2015 and 2017. But House GOP leaders have declined to commit to bring up the 15-week abortion ban legislation if they win the majority. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“First we’d need to see what our majority looks like,” House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said in a news conference on Wednesday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smith said that the debate of how to move forward on anti-abortion legislation is healthy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There's always people who don't know what is the right thing to do, and that's as healthy as it could be. I think we need to have more conference meetings, you know, so we’re all on the same page,” Smith said. “But Dobbs has been [the] engraved invitation to protect life.” </p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3646948-merrick-garland-faces-stormy-waters-over-trump-investigations/",
        "description": "<p>The convergence of investigations against former President Trump, led by the FBI’s search of his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida for classified materials, has put Attorney General Merrick Garland at the center of a political storm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans, led by former President Trump, have attacked Garland’s Justice Department as politically motivated and vowed to investigate his actions if the party retakes the House in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democrats have mostly given Garland the space to do his job, but some liberals have argued there is already clear evidence to indict Trump and questioned why the attorney general is not pressing forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some experts and those who know Garland, the former judge’s demeanor makes him the right man for the job at a time when all eyes are on him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don't think he’s paralyzed and afraid to act,” said Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School who has known Garland for years. “Getting the search warrant was a big step against the former president. He's shown he’s willing to take significant action. But I think the country is better off having a cautious person there than somebody who would have made a decision just to make a decision.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After four years of the Trump Justice Department facing political pressure from the president and being accused of tilting the scales to benefit the party in the White House, President Biden pledged to restore a sense of independence to the agency and appointed Garland, who was nominated to the Supreme Court in 2016 but never got a hearing from Republicans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garland was confirmed with a bipartisan vote, 70-30, in March 2021. But efforts to depoliticize the Justice Department have run into a major obstacle with a burst of activity in investigations into Trump, thrusting Garland into the spotlight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Democrats had already been airing frustrations over what they viewed as a glacial pace in probing Trump’s actions around Jan. 6, 2021. Those criticisms bubbled to the surface as a House committee investigating the attack on the Capitol held public hearings with damning new allegations about Trump’s rhetoric before the 6th and inaction on the day of the attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FBI’s August search of Mar-a-Lago to recover highly sensitive government materials that Trump had taken with him has only added to the clamor from some liberals for Garland to take action against the former president. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to the criticism, James Zirin, a former federal prosecutor who served in former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s (D) administration, wrote in an opinion piece for The Hill that Garland may have made a misstep in the Justice Department's handling of the Mar-a-Lago case after Judge Aileen Cannon ruled a special master should be appointed to sift through seized documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Garland and his agency have taken fire from Republicans who have almost universally rallied around Trump and accused the attorney general and FBI director of leading a political witch hunt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Republican lawmakers have pledged to investigate Garland if the GOP retakes the House majority in November. Others have broadly bemoaned that the attorney general has “weaponized” the Justice Department in approving the search warrant for Mar-a-Lago, even though it followed months of attempts to get the sensitive documents back from Trump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump himself has not directly called out the attorney general, but he has been unrelenting in accusing the FBI and Justice Department more broadly of targeting him out of concern he may run for president again in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What they did is terrible,” Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Thursday. “And I don’t think the people are going to stand for it. If you noticed, the poll numbers are the highest they’ve ever been. The people are not going to stand for this stuff. They’ve weaponized the Department of Justice and FBI.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garland for his part has steadfastly avoided weighing in publicly unless he believes it is absolutely necessary, as was the case after the FBI conducted its search of Mar-a-Lago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has pushed back on the idea that he or his team will be influenced by political considerations or public pressure one way or another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The only pressure that I, my prosecutors, or the agents feel is the pressure to do the right thing,” Garland told NBC News in a rare interview in July. “That's the only way we can pursue the rule of law, that's the only way we can keep the confidence of the American people in the rule of law, which is an essential part of our democratic system.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden formally introduced Garland as his pick to lead the Justice Department on Jan. 7, 2021, one day after the riots at the Capitol. Given the timing, and the fact that the Mar-a-Lago case only recently came into public view, experts argued Garland was clearly not chosen with his ability to withstand public pressure about Trump-related probes in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the former president was always going to hang over much of what the Biden Justice Department did given various investigations into Trump’s finances, his claims about the 2020 election and his conduct on Jan. 6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They are clearly tough-minded and not treating Trump as if he’s above the law,” said Matt Bennett, a former staffer in the Clinton White House and co-founder of the think tank Third Way. “But they are also incredibly prudent, sensitive to the charge of politicizing the department. It’s a tough balance, but I think he’s getting it all right.”</p>",

It also moves away from Democrats’ pandemic-era emphasis on mail voting, a push that delivered Georgia’s electoral votes to President Joe Biden and helped Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff win concurrent U.S. Senate runoffs to give Democrats control of Capitol Hill.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>Ways and Means: Lincoln and His Cabinet and the Financing of the Civil War, by Roger Lowenstein, Penguin Press, 448 pages, $30</p>\n<p>With Ways and Means, Roger Lowenstein, the author of several popular books on finance, has tackled the Civil War. The book's subtitle—Lincoln and His Cabinet and the Financing of the Civil War—is misleadingly incomplete, because Lowenstein covers far more than Union finance. He aims to demonstrate how the Republicans \"vastly enlarged the government.\" He not only describes the war's expansion of state power across many dimensions; he celebrates this outcome as \"an agenda for industry and growth, and to foster opportunity, especially for those at the bottom.\"</p>\n<p>Lowenstein is an engaging, readable author, and he has consulted a wide range of primary sources and secondary literature. But he goes too far when he claims that this Republican \"revolution\" has been \"largely overlooked.\" Really? Certainly not among historians. Lowenstein's endnotes even cite some works making the same point, including Richard Franklin Bensel's Yankee Leviathan (1990) and James M. McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom (1988). Among the myriad other histories that have likewise done so are Richard White's The Republic for Which It Stands (2017), Steven Hahn's A Nation Without Borders (2016), and my own Emancipating Slaves, Enslaving Free Men (1996). And certainly many nonhistorians who have read widely about the Civil War are aware of its impact on the central government's powers.</p>\n<p>As Lowenstein unveils the government interventions that brought about what he calls a \"staggering transformation,\" he delves into their political origins as deeply as their economic features. This permits him to highlight Abraham Lincoln's role more than most surveys do. Lincoln had been a member of the Whig Party, which traditionally looked askance at presidential intrusion into Congress' realm. But Lowenstein credits Lincoln with working behind the scenes to promote legislation that emerged during his presidency.</p>\n<p>What did that legislation do? Prior to the war, the only sources of federal revenue were a low tariff and sale of public lands. By the end of the war, average tariff duties had risen to 47 percent, decisively moving the economy from free trade to protectionism. A vast array of internal taxes, including a graduated income tax, were imposed through a new revenue bureaucracy.</p>\n<p>Western lands were opened to homesteading and granted to promote a transcontinental railroad. Additional land grants to the states for endowing colleges constituted the first federal aid to education. A Department of Agriculture was created to help farmers, and immigration was subsidized for employers. Congress also created the National Academy of Sciences to promote technological innovation, and it established such new agencies as the Government Printing Office and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. (The Homestead Act is arguably better seen as a form of privatization than as an extension of government power, but Lowenstein is not alone in placing it under the latter heading.)</p>\n<p>Increased government borrowing resulted, by Lowenstein's count, in the issue of \"thirty-two varieties of notes, bonds, and other instruments.\" One reason for this array, not explicitly mentioned in the book, is that it wasn't until after World War I that the Treasury gained its current discretion to issue whatever debt is necessary to cover expenditures. Before then, practically every new loan to the government required a separate act, debatable in Congress. Lincoln's first treasury secretary—Salmon P. Chase, who had a sometimes uneasy relationship with the president—thus figures prominently in Ways and Means.</p>\n<p>Some of these loans could be quite complex, and Lowenstein has to simplify things for readers unfamiliar with finance. Just to give an example, bonds issued in 1862 known as Five-Twenties paid an annual 6 percent interest semi-annually. They had a fixed maturity of 20 years, during which their market price could fluctuate, but could be unilaterally paid back at face value by the government after five years. In technical terms, they were a 20-year loan with an embedded call option after five years.</p>\n<p>Prior to the war, the U.S. government had generally run surpluses, and the national debt stood at a miniscule $65 million (equivalent to about $2 billion in 2022 dollars). By the end of the war, the debt had risen to $1.3 billion, with interest alone constituting, as Lowenstein notes, \"more than the entire prewar budget.\" Yet that was not sufficient to cover the war's cost. So Chase, previously a hard-money Democrat, reluctantly resorted to fiat money—greenbacks—generating inflation that ultimately increased the price level by nearly 80 percent. Lowenstein considers this \"hardly all bad\" and bemoans postwar efforts to reestablish a gold standard.</p>\n<p>Similar predilections are apparent in Lowenstein's discussion of another Chase initiative, the national banking system, which came to fruition only after Chase's resignation as treasury secretary. Lowenstein unfairly characterizes the prewar monetary system as \"chaotic,\" ignoring the copious scholarship that finds antebellum \"free banking,\" although far from perfect, to have been at least as serviceable as most subsequent U.S. monetary regimes. Moreover, Lowenstein's praise for national banking hardly accords with his description, in his book on the Federal Reserve, of the national banking system as plagued by panics. Toward the end of Ways and Means, he even backtracks slightly, admitting that the new system gave too much dominance to Wall Street. But he never realizes that the two most serious defects were nearly identical for both prewar and postwar banking: legal limits on branch banking and requirements that banks hold government bonds (state-issued before the war and Treasury-issued afterward).</p>\n<p>Lowenstein is also inconsistent in his appraisal of government-subsidized transcontinental railroads. Although he calls them a \"striking success,\" he concedes that they were \"a tempting vehicle for corruption,\" manifested in the Crédit Mobilier scandal. Yet he is blind to the fact that government subsidies made corruption almost inevitable. Nor does he seem aware of the extent to which the transcontinentals were built ahead of demand, contributing to shoddy construction, bankruptcies, premature settlement, overexpansion of agriculture, subsequent agricultural economic distress, and environmental damage.</p>\n<p>Lowenstein also treats, although less extensively, the parallel expansion of government within the Confederacy. His account really shines when describing how harshly the Confederate hyperinflation affected the Southern population, which by the end of the war was on the verge of starvation. He also points out a factor not usually mentioned: The Confederacy's steady loss of territory and population aggravated the inflation.</p>\n<p>Lowenstein does miss one crucial aspect of Confederate mobilization when he asserts that the South was \"too late to build factories.\" In reality, the wartime Southern economy underwent forced industrialization through government-owned facilities. Gen. Josiah Gorgas, chief of Confederate ordnance, could brag in his diary that \"large arsenals have been organized at Richmond, Augusta, Charleston, Columbus, Macon, Atlanta, and Selma,\" along with powder mills, cannon foundries, rifle and pistol factories, and more. \"Where three years ago we were not making a gun, pistol nor a saber,\" he concluded, \"we now make all of these.\"</p>\n<p>The book stands out for its lengthy treatment of the cotton trade, particularly trade between the lines. No general account that I'm aware of has given this topic as much attention. Permitting the purchase of Southern cotton was a source of tension within the Union leadership. Lincoln and Chase pushed for a limited and regulated opening of this trade through licensed dealers, in the hope that increased cotton exports would bring more gold into the Northern economy. But military leaders such as Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman were adamantly opposed to—and sometimes thwarted—the administration's efforts, believing cotton trading would help the South prolong the war. In any case, an illicit trade persisted and was often facilitated by bribery.</p>\n<p>Lowenstein emphasizes, rightly, that Lincoln went to war to preserve the Union and that ending slavery was an initially unintended consequence. He also provides a good summary of the effort, falling under Chase's purview, to grant former slaves land, with limited success, in the South Carolina sea islands, which were occupied early by the Union military. Because he otherwise pays little attention to military events, except as they impinged on finance, his treatment of them is limited and occasionally simplistic.</p>\n<p>Lowenstein has dated views on the alleged inefficiency of the prewar Southern slave economy and buys into the long discredited Beard-Hacker thesis that the Civil War promoted subsequent economic growth and industrialization, with his version of the thesis emphasizing government activism. In fact, the U.S. had already been experiencing healthy sustained growth for three decades prior to the war. Moreover, some of the new policies Lowenstein admires contributed to postwar poverty in the South—particularly the national banking system, which throttled sources of credit in that region.</p>\n<p>In short, Ways and Means is a good introduction to the politics of Civil War finance, exposing facets not usually covered in popular works. But the author's interventionist bias often leads his economic conclusions astray.</p>\n<p>The post How the U.S. Paid for the Civil War appeared first on Reason.com.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the end, it was the knee.</p><p>Roger Federer has played more than 1,500 matches in 24 years, and has never quit in the middle of one for injury, illness, exhaustion, burnout, or apathy. His most formidable on-court opponents, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, who have surpassed him in Grand Slam count and are still battling it out for statistical GOAT status, cannot say the same. Nadal has retired (ended play) mid-match nine times, Djokovic thirteen. Federer’s joints––the ones that bore the stress of his game, birthed the transcendent nature of his movement––are the same ones finally forcing him to relent. His body simply can’t take it anymore, and there is nothing he can do to stop it. His legacy may be immortal; his physical condition is not.</p><p>On Thursday morning, an image of Federer––stately, smiling—appeared on Twitter with a voice narration of the same monogrammed letter he’d posted to Instagram. The upcoming Laver Cup, the tournament his agency helped debut in 2017, would be his final appearance. Twenty Grand Slam singles, and thousands of speculative guesses later, Federer’s retirement was official. It was long rumored, long expected, and somehow still felt like a shock.</p><p>The news might feel like less of a heartbreak if it were happening in a vacuum. Serena Williams announced her retirement from tennis in August. A frequently injured and 36-year-old Nadal’s decision feels imminent. ​​Even Djokovic, a spry 35, is nearing the fifth decade of his life. We (us ’90s kids, in particular) are witnessing a very real changing of the guard. For 20 years, we were spoiled by an embarrassment of riches, some of the greatest athletes of all time, on court together, battling together––raucous, five-set duels, the kind that brought them to their knees, and screaming viewers to their feet. And now, what was changing slowly at first––humdrum wear and tear, a missed tournament or two––seems like it’s ending all at once. Suddenly, when we turn on our TV screens, we may see mere excellence, not historic aberration.</p><p>[Read: Roger Federer’s other legacy]</p><p>The congratulations, tributes, devastations, and crying emojis for Federer were both instant and global. The man is 41 years old––geriatric, in tennis years. He’d had three surgeries on his right knee in fewer than two years. In June of 2021, he withdrew after the third round of the French Open to preserve his precarious, twice-operated state and not risk further injury. That July, he lost in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon, as the oldest man since 1977 to play in them. Still, there was a hopeful sense that all of this—surgeries, rehab, absence, crutches—was somehow leading to a return, a Shakespearean call (“Once more unto the breach!”) to overcome the throes of pain. But there was one unspoken question: A return to what? To the smooth rotation of his preoperative knee? To his early 20s? (Could he take us with him?) He was always only going to get older. Still, the hope was a microcosm of the human relationship to physical form, especially in this era of technology and age reversal––a clinging to the idea that the body can revert to the state it was in before disease, age, injury, entropy come to call for it.</p><p>Federer himself may have held such expectations. He said, after his third right-knee surgery, that the worst was behind him, and that rehabilitation had, so far, been successful. One last go, perhaps on the grass of Wimbledon, where he’d won eight of his Grand Slam titles, was still on the table.</p><p>As it turns out, his 2019 Wimbledon match against Novak Djokovic was Federer’s last appearance in a Grand Slam final. He had two match points, on his serve—which, in tennis, is precisely the sort of offensive position you want to be in—and Djokovic saved them both. The loss was crushing. It felt like the first inkling of a physical decline. In 2016, he’d undergone arthroscopic surgery on his left knee to repair a torn meniscus (an unexpected result of running a bath for his children, he said, the day after losing to Djokovic in the Australian Open semis). He recovered in time to make it through to the quarterfinals of Wimbledon, but skipped the U.S. Open to give his knee a little more rest. In January, at the 2017 Australian Open, at age 35 years and 174 days, he won the title. He won it again in 2018, the second-oldest man ever to win a Slam.</p><p>There is something disruptive about the idea of tennis without the someone who’s become its synonym—the person who blazed in on the heels of Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi to build on their faster, topspin-heavy, whippier game, who metabolized it in such an irreplaceable way that sometimes watching it hurt. Federer upended expectations for what seemed possible with simultaneous grace and aggression. The Big 3—Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic—have won 63 of the past 77 Grand Slam tournaments. Early in his career, Federer played with bleached-out tips and baggier clothing, but the beauty of his game just became more of what it already was––the prima ballerina gliding on zero-gravity feet. His reflexes are second to none. His backhand is so beautiful that there is nothing new to say about it. He has a not-of-this-Earth quality about him, a thing that suggests the quotidian limits on the human body and mind can be challenged, tinkered with, chucked away altogether. Even in recent years, when he was playing in pain, passive observers were none the wiser.</p><p>[Read: A tale of two tennis G.O.A.T.s]</p><p>The greatest rivalry in tennis may very well be that of the player versus the frailty of his parts. Consider the nag of Nadal’s foot, or Agassi’s back, or Andy Murray’s hip. In the early stages things can be staved off with localized injections, lidocaine, rest. A trim of the meniscus there, a reparation of the ligament here. Hips can be resurfaced, tendons reattached. But eventually, no matter the effort, or talent, or Slam count, the same outcome persists. The body is the thing, and degeneration is its victor.</p><p>On Monday, the 19-year-old Spanish tennis player Carlos Alcaraz stood in Times Square, holding his brand-new U.S. Open winner’s trophy above his head. The night before, in the men’s finals match against Casper Ruud, he’d won his first Grand Slam title and become the youngest man in ATP history to claim the No. 1 ranking. Alcaraz was born in 2003, the year that Federer won his first Slam. Federer’s retirement announcement came four days later. Alcaraz shared an image of the two together, grinning away, racquet in hand, as he stood next to an idol.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Shira Mandelzis fell in love with flag football while playing on her middle-school team. An avid snowboarder and all-around athletic kid, she loved the energy she felt while on the field, and the camaraderie engendered by the intensely physical game. So last summer, heading into her junior year at Riverdale Country School in the Bronx, Mandelzis decided to sign up for football. She would be the only girl, but it was a no-cut, no-tryout team, so she figured the worst she’d have to deal with would be not feeling welcomed by the team. Instead, soon after she’d filled out the enrollment form, Riverdale’s athletic director reached out to Mandelzis about specific requirements she would have to meet in order to join the team.</p><p></p><p>Because Mandelzis was a girl trying to join a boys’ sport, she had to abide by a set of “mixed gender” sport regulations that the New York State Education Department passed back in 1985. These rules, which were developed in part to protect girls from harm during competitions, required that Mandelzis submit a record of her past performance in physical-education classes, a doctor’s physical documenting her medical history, and assessments of her body type (height and weight, joint structure) and sexual maturity level (breast and pubic-hair development measured according to a medical guideline known as the Tanner Scale). Once she passed a fitness test, including a one-mile run, sprints, push-ups, and curl-ups, she sent her scores to a closed-door panel including physical-education staff, other administrators of the school’s choosing, and a consulting physician. The panel then set out to determine whether Mandelzis was, essentially, strong, developed, and athletic enough to play a contact sport with boys—even though those boys needed to prove no such thing.</p><p></p><p>Although Mandelzis’s exact experience may seem rare, it exemplifies the way many people still view sports as a perfectly reasonable venue in which to enforce exclusion on the basis of sex. School sports are typically sex-segregated, and in America some of them have even come to be seen as either traditionally for boys or traditionally for girls: Think football, wrestling, field hockey, volleyball. However, it’s becoming more common for these lines to blur, especially as Gen Zers are more likely than members of previous generations to reject a strict gender binary altogether. Maintaining this binary in youth sports reinforces the idea that boys are inherently bigger, faster, and stronger than girls in a competitive setting—a notion that’s been challenged by scientists for years.</p><p></p><p>Decades of research have shown that sex is far more complex than we may think. And though sex differences in sports show advantages for men, researchers today still don’t know how much of this to attribute to biological difference versus the lack of support provided to women athletes to reach their highest potential. “Science is increasingly showing how sex is dynamic; it has multiple aspects and also shifts; for example, social experiences can actually change levels of sex-related hormones like testosterone in our bodies in a second-to-second and month-to-month way!” Sari van Anders, the research chair in social neuroendocrinology at Queen’s University, in Ontario, told me by email. She said that this complexity means it doesn’t make sense to separate sports by sex in order to protect women athletes from getting hurt. “If safety was a concern, and there was evidence to select certain bodily characteristics to base safety cut-offs on, then you would see, say, shorter men excluded from competing with taller men, or lighter women from competing with heavier women, across sports.” We do see weight-class separation in boxing, rowing, and wrestling, yet it’s far from the norm across all sports, and isn’t typically seen as a method of integrating athletes of different sexes—though it could be. Old notions of sex as a marker of physical capability are changing, and more research is making clear that sex differences aren’t really clear at all.</p><p></p><p>Regulations like the ones Mandelzis encountered in the Bronx don’t affect girls alone. Colin Ives, who graduated from Hackley School in Tarrytown, New York, this year, “basically had a [field hockey] stick in my hand for my whole life,” he told me on Zoom. His mom, Jenny Leffler, is an English teacher and field-hockey coach at the school, so Ives grew up attending practices and games, and took to the sport. Around the world, field hockey is played mostly by men, but here in the U.S. it’s typically seen as a girls’ sport. So Ives had to go through the same New York State mixed-gender-competition rules to get on the team. He was approved by his school’s panel to play during his freshman and sophomore years (the pandemic canceled his junior season). But last year, Ives went through the process, and just days before his first league game his head of school informed Leffler that Ives was not allowed to play. Hackley had approved his petition to play, but the other private high schools that make up the Ivy Preparatory School League, which Hackley is a part of, voted to not allow Ives to play.</p><p></p><p>As with many kids who play sports in school, Ives’s teammates were his close friends, and they wanted to play together. Ives told me that the girls on his team (as well as on opposing teams) expressed support for him to play because the idea that he was “too good” to play with them felt discriminatory toward them. “It’s belittling to them to know that their own heads of school or their own athletic directors or whoever they would credit for making these decisions didn’t think that they were strong enough or had the physical capabilities to play against me,” Ives said. Just as Mandelzis told me that she could take a hit as well as the boys on her football team, Ives said the assumption that he’d be a danger to girls is an oversimplification. “There are players on teams that we play that are faster than me, that are stronger than me, that can hit the ball harder than me. So I knew that [the league’s] arguments didn’t really have any basis in that regard.” (A representative of the Ivy Preparatory School League did not respond to requests for comment.)</p><p></p><p>In recent years, the question of who can play on what team has developed into a full-blown front in the culture war, based in large part on the fear that transgender girls will unfairly take over girls’ sports because of sweeping generalizations about biological athletic advantages. As of this writing, 18 states have passed laws to ban trans girls and women from playing on certain school teams (some laws ban trans boys and men from certain teams as well). But perhaps what’s missing most from that debate is the question over why there are rigidly segregated girls’ teams and boys’ teams at all.</p><p></p><p>The insistence on separating sports teams strictly by sex is backwards, argues Michela Musto, an assistant sociology professor at the University of British Columbia who has studied the effect of the gender binary on students and young athletes. “Part of the reason why we have this belief that boys are inherently stronger than girls, and even the fact that we believe that gender is a binary, is because of sport itself, not the other way around,” she told me by phone. The strict sex segregation we’ve instilled in sports at all levels gives the impression that men and women have completely different capabilities, but in reality, she said, the relationship between sex and athletic capability is never so cut-and-dried. “There are some boys who also could get really hurt if they were competing against other boys in contact sports.” Researchers have noted for years that there may even be more diversity in athletic performance within a sex than between the sexes. One recent small study in Norway found no innate sex difference when it came to youth-soccer players’ technical skills. The researchers hypothesized that the gap they did find between girls and boys was likely due to socialization, not biology.</p><p></p><p>While the need to separate athletes by sex is still held firmly by many as a way to protect girls and women from harm, many people advocate for moving to a more integrated and inclusive approach. The Women’s Sports Foundation, founded by the tennis legend Billie Jean King, offered guidance on how girls and boys can equitably compete with and against each other: “If the skill, size and strength of any participant, female or male, compared to others playing on the team creates the potential of a hazardous environment, participation may be limited on the basis of these factors, rather than the sex of the participant.” In other words, if a girl on the football team needs to be assessed for her size and strength for safety reasons, so should all of the boys.</p><p></p><p>The panel at Riverdale ultimately approved Mandelzis’s request to play on the football team, but she felt unfairly treated and violated by the physical exams. She won’t return to the gridiron this fall, or to Riverdale. “Going through the regulations was so infuriating for me, because there were these freshman [boys] who are 100 pounds and half my size and all they had to do was sign up,” she told me by phone. “And the fact that my ability to get on the field had to be tested simply because of my gender, when I had more experience than these other people, was just very upsetting for me.” When reached for comment, a representative for Riverdale told me that the school agrees with Mandelzis about the state regulations. “We encouraged Shira to try and change New York State regulations for all young women playing sports, as we agree with her that the whole panel review system is seriously flawed, outdated, and sexist; therefore, we attempted to help connect her with elected officials and state lobbyists.” Mandelzis is, in fact, trying to overturn the regulations; she’s retained a lawyer who has made a formal request to the New York State Education Department to revoke the guidelines, citing a violation of Title IX and the equal-protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. (Department officials acknowledged receipt of the letter and said they plan to review and respond to the request.)</p><p></p><p>Mandelzis’s lawyer, Iliana Konidaris, told me that the existence of these mixed-gender-competition guidelines in New York has effects beyond the playing field. “The sports field is not … a niche issue,” she said. “It’s where a lot of students get their sense of fairness, sportsmanship, equality, culture, and confidence.” This became starkly clear to Musto, the University of British Columbia researcher, when she recently spent months observing sixth, seventh, and eighth graders at a school in California to assess how gender informs education. The gender binary’s influence on schoolkids crystallized for her when she interviewed nearly 200 students and the one subject they commonly identified as a “boys’ subject” was P.E.</p><p></p><p>But some young people seem intent on challenging the binary sports system. In 2018, according to data from the National Federation of State High School Associations, 2,404 girls played high-school tackle football, up from fewer than 1,000 in 2008. Around the country, the number of girls on wrestling teams increased to 28,447 in the 2019–20 season from just 4,975 in 2005. In 2019, Trista Blasz, a then-12-year-old wrestling phenom, was denied her request to join Lancaster High School’s junior-varsity boys’ team through the New York guidelines. According to the Washington Post, the Lancaster district medical director wrote on Blasz’s medical evaluation, “Girls don’t play boys sports in Lancaster schools.” Shortly after news of his response broke, the doctor’s contract was terminated, and Blasz was allowed to wrestle. Earlier this year, a pinfall win in a match helped earn her school a divisional title.</p><p></p><p>A different youth-sports world is possible. Musto has observed a swim team in California, for instance, whose athletes are separated by ability rather than sex; it has changed how the kids view one another. “It wasn’t a big deal if they had to share lanes with one another or they were competing against one another during practice. Gender wasn’t the primary thing that was shaping the perceptions of who was a good athlete or not,” she said. But as long as laws and general practice of youth sports remain rooted in the idea that one sex is inherently inferior, young athletes will continue to learn and internalize that harmful lesson.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Donald Trump will be remembered as one of the most consequential presidents in American history. On a political level, he attempted to overturn an election—an unusual enterprise for a president—and popularized the idea that democratic outcomes can be rejected outright if you don’t like the results. Oddly enough, however, Trump’s impact may prove more distinctive and perhaps even more lasting on an intellectual level.</p><p>Trump had an instinct that something had gone fundamentally wrong in America and felt that his supporters should be angry as a result. And he came to channel that impulse viscerally. That such an anti-intellectual president could provide inspiration for a distinct intellectual orientation is an amusing twist. The struggle to codify Trumpism and transform it into a working philosophy is under way, to mixed results so far. Earlier this week, self-described “national conservatives” descended upon Miami for a major conference of a movement whose members “understand that the past and future of conservatism are inextricably tied to the idea of the nation.” For them, the nation is a distinct cultural unit, whose independence and sovereignty must be jealously guarded against globalists, international institutions, and large-scale immigration. These are not neoconservatives or even just conservatives. For the national conservatives, the George W. Bushes and Mitt Romneys of the world are the problem. And they themselves are apparently the solution.</p><p>[David Brooks: The terrifying future of the American right]</p><p>These partisans of the new right have the potential to push through a genuine reorientation of the Republican Party—not just the haphazard shift that Trump touched off. Because America’s winner-take-all electoral system practically guarantees a two-party system, to transform one of those parties will be to transform American public life. The problem for the national conservatives, however, is that they have defined themselves in opposition to something real but have not necessarily defined what they want to do about it.</p><p>As president, Trump demonstrated remarkable flexibility and little regard for ideology. Self-interest trumped all. And it was his self-interest to draw a stark contrast with a Republican Party that was long oriented around the ideas of limited government, free trade, comprehensive immigration reform, and neo-imperial adventures abroad. Through bumper-sticker slogans, such as “America First” and “Make America great again,” Trump elevated the nation as a sort of transcendent political community. In doing so, he gave conservatives permission to think beyond the bipartisan assumptions—prioritizing the individual at home and globalization abroad—that had structured postwar American politics. And that consensus, if it wasn’t already dead, was clearly dying.</p><p>At least until recently, classical liberalism—not to be confused with the modern American designation of anyone left of center as “liberal”—was the dominant American tradition. At the most basic level, liberalism is the project of carving out rights, which derive from a recognition of the dignity inherent to every human life. Post-liberal movements, including the national conservatives, aren’t, in principle, opposed to individual rights. The issue is that they believe this conception of liberalism exists only in theory.</p><p>In practice, liberalism, animated by a belief in human progress, can’t help but shake free of its past limits, demanding more and more for itself over time. And so the project of carving out rights is ongoing and perpetually in motion, extending itself into new areas—including the right to discard traditional conceptions of gender and sexuality and turning aside the views of anyone who objects. This new liberalism, at once a deformation of liberalism and seemingly its inevitable conclusion, is what Senator Josh Hawley in his conference address called “repressive tolerance” and what the Israeli theorist and conference organizer Yoram Hazony terms “woke neo-Marxism.” For Hazony, the effort to recover “the old liberalism” is futile, an exercise in fighting a battle that has already ended. As someone who studies various iterations of post-liberalism and outright illiberalism, I am intrigued but also worried to see a movement like this gaining ground in my own country. Though the new right may be correct about liberal excesses, its solutions are another matter.</p><p>Even though Hazony is an Orthodox Jew, national conservatism has a Christian cast. This isn’t a problem for Hazony, who believes that majorities should have the right to define the contours of a nation’s cultural and political reality. The most recent National Conservatism Statement of Principles, which he helped draft, lays this out in some detail:</p>\r\n<p>The Bible should be read as the first among the sources of a shared Western civilization in schools and universities, and as the rightful inheritance of believers and non-believers alike. Where a Christian majority exists, public life should be rooted in Christianity and its moral vision, which should be honored by the state and other institutions both public and private.</p>\r\n<p>The problem, as with all post-liberal projects, is that although highlighting liberalism’s failures is easy and even necessary—I have made many of these criticisms myself here in these pages—devising a viable alternative is much more difficult.</p><p>In perhaps the most striking speech at the National Conservatism conference, Hawley called for a “biblical revolution.” But when he explained what this meant to him, it seemed empty of specific content:</p>\r\n<p>We are a revolutionary nation precisely because we are the heirs of the revolution of the Bible … To a world composed of clans and tribes, the Bible introduced the very idea of the individual. To a world that valued the wealthy and the well-born before all others, the Bible taught the dignity of the common man. To a world that prized order and social control, the Bible spoke of liberty. Without the Bible, there is no modernity. Without the Bible, there is no America.</p>\r\n<p>I am the rare Muslim who wishes that there was more, rather than less, Christianity in America. But it’s unclear what exactly can be done about this, short of an act of God. The simple fact is that Christian belief and observance have dropped precipitously over the past two decades. So what does it mean for America to reconstitute itself as a Christian nation if a growing number of Americans themselves seem uninterested or opposed to the prospect?</p><p>[Derek Thompson: Three decades ago, America lost its religion. Why?]</p><p>Insofar as nationalism is about protecting distinctly national traditions and mythologies, self-respecting nationalists of any faith will understandably seek to elevate Christianity’s role in public life. But if Christianity is what made America great, then surely liberalism, classically understood, was an important part of the story too.</p><p>To say that the Bible introduced the idea of the individual is an argument for the Christian origins of the liberal faith, or what Hazony might call “old liberalism.” It is difficult, and perhaps even impossible, to separate the seemingly secular idea of individual rights from the Christian notion of man being created in God’s image, endowed with self-evident, inalienable rights by his creator. In his book Dominion, the British historian Tom Holland writes that “to live in a Western country is to live in a society still utterly saturated by Christian concepts and assumptions.” The revolution Hawley is describing and seems to long for already happened. It is, as he himself suggests, the intellectual revolution that gave birth to modern liberalism—the same liberalism that national conservatives are now lamenting with increasing vehemence.</p><p>This vehemence is not, as some critics allege, merely a new ruse for blocking wealth redistribution through tax cuts and deregulation. In actual policy, if not necessarily in rhetoric, the Republican Party has lurched leftward on economic issues. This has led to a modest if somewhat remarkable upsurge in bipartisan cooperation on major spending bills. As the writer James Sutton recently argued, Congress is more functional today than it has been at any point in at least a decade.</p><p>Like most things in American politics today, the deeper—and perhaps irresolvable—divides are about culture, meaning, and the nature of the human person. The national conservatives view today’s liberals as woke cultural warriors who pose an existential threat to the nation and its traditions. In this sense, the new right is more concerned with who we are—and who we aren’t—than with what Congress does or doesn’t do. This is not an army of would-be policy wonks.</p><p>Coherence or specificity is probably too much to ask for, especially at such an early stage in the development of a conservative countercultural movement. And, for now, it’s just that: a movement. And movements can survive and even flourish as long as they have an enemy against which to define themselves. The national conservatives at least have that, and it’s probably enough to sustain them—for now. Opposition is the first step, but it certainly isn’t the last.</p>",

Joey Luchessi got the start and tossed 2.2 scoreless innings. Tylor Megill followed as a reliever, getting some experience with entering mid-inning, sitting down, then coming back in, though he did allow a run during his second frame of work. Later in the game, Drew Smith also tossed a scoreless frame. The offense in this one came from two home runs - a solo shot by Dominic Smith and a grand slam form Daniel Palka in the bottom of the eighth that put the Mets ahead.</p>\n\nCF Travis Jankowski: 0-4, R, K\nDH Dominic Smith: 3-4, 2 R, HR (8), RBI\nC Francisco Alvarez: 2-3, R, BB\n1B Daniel Palka: 1-4, R, HR (26), 4 RBI, K\n2B Yolmer Sanchez: 0-3, K\nLF Khalil Lee: 0-4, 2 K\nRF Carlos Rincon: 0-3, BB\nSS JT Riddle: 0-3\n3B Deven Marrero: 0-3, K, E (6)\n\nREHAB ALERT: LHP Joey Lucchesi: 2.2 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K\n\nREHAB ALERT: RHP Tylor Megill: 1.0 IP, 2 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 1 K\nRHP Nate Fisher: 0.1 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 0 K\n\nREHAB ALERT: RHP Drew Smith: 1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K\nRHP Jose Rodriguez: 3.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 2 BB, 3 K, W (2-3)\nRHP Yoan Lopez: 0.0 IP, 4 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 0 BB, 0 K\nRHP R.J.

Tony Dibrell walked half the ballpark but danced around trouble, and in total the Rumble Ponies allowed only three hits.

The new prime minister has been forced to tear up the blueprint for her early weeks in No 10 and push back a planned “policy blitz” and the final touches to her reshuffle. After the Queen’s funeral, normal business will resume, although Truss faces many challenges.</p><p>Sunday<br />Truss will hold a series of informal meetings at Downing Street with a small number of world leaders in the UK to attend the funeral. No 10 has played down the significance of the talks, saying that much of the discussion will involve reflecting on the Queen. Aides’ refusal to brief reporters on the content of the talks because of the national mourning period has raised some eyebrows. Truss will meet the US president, Joe Biden, for the first time since she took over, with tensions already strained by her threats to rip up the post-Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland and Biden’s reluctance to strike a free trade deal with Britain as a result. She will also meet the Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, over the ongoing Northern Ireland protocol row.

        "description": "<p>President Biden’s plan to have taxpayers cover the cost of canceling student debt has come under fire from many sides, but there is one thing everybody can agree on: The cost of college has gotten out of hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, there are solutions that states can implement to help lower costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Biden administration claims that student loan debt is a “significant burden on America’s middle class,” making it difficult for workers to buy homes, save for retirement, or start a business. The administration notes that the total cost of four-year colleges has tripled since 1980, even factoring in inflation. According to Forbes, the cost of attending college in that year was a mere $10,231 annually but it has grown to $28,775.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>College operations have changed in the past 40 years, but universities do not appear to be in such dire financial shape that they need to continue charging these high tuition rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Endowments, even for public universities, are enormous. My home state of Michigan provides some examples. The University of Michigan in 2020 had an endowment of more than $12.3 billion. This is one of the 10 largest endowments in the country, and that’s before factoring in the 41 percent growth it experienced in 2021. The state’s largest school, Michigan State University, sits at 34th place, with around $3.4 billion in its endowment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While massive endowments may not come as much of a surprise for schools in the Big Ten, some of the state’s midsize and smaller universities also find themselves with hefty amounts of funds. Central Michigan University, with a student population of 17,224 in 2021, has an endowment of $246 million. Wayne State University, which receives the third-highest state funding, over $200 million per year, has an endowment of $519 million. Western Michigan University has $494 million, and Grand Valley State has $175 million in endowed funds. These do not appear to be organizations on the brink of bankruptcy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why shouldn’t these schools be held responsible for some of the costs? They’re arguably more at fault for the student debt crisis than the skilled laborer who didn’t go to college or the taxpayers who have paid off their student loans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, there is a legislative solution to the ballooning cost of tuition and the inequitable redistribution of debt. The state of Michigan has the power to appropriate money to maintain most of Michigan’s public universities. But nothing requires that money to be appropriated without some strings attached. The simple solution is merely a cap on tuition as a condition of receiving appropriated funds. Should they choose to, states such as Michigan could present universities with a choice: limit the tuition and fees charged to students to a predetermined amount, or forgo state funding. If that amount is indexed to inflation, costs of attendance will remain fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eleven states have laws restricting the size of tuition increases. It stands to reason that states can go further by actually capping tuition and indexing subsequent increases to inflation. One state, Louisiana, already does so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universities would be left with a choice — limit the cost of attendance, or abandon taxpayer funding as a source of revenue. As of 2019, state and local funds were responsible for 44 percent of public, four-year colleges’ revenue. Losing this revenue would be a significant cut to universities’ budget. At the same time, those universities that choose to cap the cost of attendance would then have an opportunity to compete more aggressively on price, while also providing students with greater choice as to the amount of debt they incur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The universities still come out ahead. The University of Michigan enrolled a total of 50,278 students. Tuition and fees from these students represent only 14 percent of the university’s operating revenue. Under a capped system, keeping tuition around $10,000 annually, the university’s revenue from the cost of attendance would decline to around $514 million. This reduction represents a mere 5.3 percent of the nearly $9.7 billion of revenue that Michigan received in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the university could also refuse to cap the cost of attendance. In doing so, it would forgo $163 million in state funding, less than 2 percent of its operating revenues. Neither outcome will leave the university destitute. But not accepting state funds would still benefit the public, as funding that would have gone to the university can be reinvested in other public projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden’s plan to forgive up to $20,000 of student debt per borrower has sparked debates, and it is unlikely the president even has the authority to order such an expenditure. But state governments have a tool at hand that would get more directly to the cause of exploding college costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By forcing universities to choose between state funding and limiting tuition costs, state legislatures can save taxpayers money or, at the very least, ensure that their taxes aren’t supporting the continually increasing cost of attending college.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve Delie is director of labor policy and Workers for Opportunity at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy in Midland, Mich.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Recently I was watching an MLS match and a familiar scene played out before me:</p>\n<p>A player comes flying down the left wing with the ball at his feet, and a defender charges out to confront him. The attacker slows for a moment, which of course slows the defender, and then suddenly puts on a tremendous burst of speed that leaves the defender far behind. Now he’s all by himself out there near the touchline, with his teammates gathering in the box. He puts in a cross … and it sails far over everyone’s head and goes out for a throw-in — on one bounce. He overhits the cross by a good thirty yards. </p>\n<p>As I say, a pretty (sadly) typical scene for the viewer of what my son calls My Little Soccer: absolutely elite athleticism combined with shockingly poor technique. This is also what makes it so difficult to compare MLS sides to the rest of the world. The FiveThirtyEight club ranking currently gives the Philadelphia Union the highest ranking among MLS teams, at 95th in the world — but that seems way too high to me: I just can’t see them beating any of the next 25 or so clubs on the list. Though every MLS team has some skilled players, the Union don’t have enough players with the requisite level of skill. But the strength and speed and stamina of the players are tremendously impressive. </p>\n<p>Basically, when I watch MLS I feel that I’m watching world-class athletes from some other sport who just started playing soccer a year or so ago. I know that that’s not true, of course; I know that these guys have been playing soccer their whole lives. But it’s so rare — in comparison not just to the level of the European top five leagues, but to Championship and Bundesliga 2 sides — to see a delicate first touch, or an accurate cross, or close control of the ball in traffic, or several passes strung together, that that’s what it looks like. To me anyway. </p>\n<p>I’d really like to enjoy MLS more, because, as I have noted, VAR in the Premier League is so utterly broken that I’m taking a break from watching that league. VAR can be shambolic elsewhere too, and in my view should be completely abandoned everywhere in the world — but the Premier League’s implementation of review is consistently appalling. If I’m going to regularly watch another league, though, it’s probably not going to be MLS. </p>",

Northern Ireland Opera had loaned members of its chorus to boost numbers (alongside Belfast’s Priory Singers) for the royal ceremony, the cathedral having sacked its own excellent choir and music director, in a cloistral blunder worthy of Trollope, just weeks ago.</p><p>Luckily this is a region rich in vocal talent. The locally based NI Opera chorus is, post-Covid, new, recruited through open auditions earlier this year yet already able to produce the vital, full-bodied sound needed for Verdi’s beloved work. The first opera to be produced in Frank Matcham’s magnificent 1895 theatre since it reopened last year after a £12m restoration, this Traviata was deftly cast, impressively sung, perceptively conceived and direct in impact, no mean feat. Lang kept the pace swift but never lost touch with the music’s heartbeat pulse. The orchestra was responsive and agile.</p> Continue reading...",

Wade, some Republicans — especially those in tough 2022 races — are taking things a step further in trying to rid themselves of the issue: Embracing the idea that voters themselves should decide it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The party as a whole, of course, probably won’t like what those voters decide, as Kansas recently showed. And we should hardly expect this approach to catch on very widely. Indeed, getting such measures on the ballot looks to be one of the next big battlegrounds in the fight over abortion, with Republicans as a whole preparing to fight against it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“But to a few candidates, direct democracy is apparently an attractive off-ramp.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For members: The GOP’s Abortion Problem Is Real and Big</p>",

Artist Tim O’Brien created the portrait of John F. Kennedy for the cover under the art direction of Pamela Fogg.</p>\n<p>The EDDIE and OZZIE Awards recognize excellence in journalism and design across all sectors of the publishing industry. Hosted by FOLIO Magazine for nearly 30 years, they are one of the broadest and longest-running competitions for editors. The EDDIE Awards recognize achievements in writing and editing, and the OZZIE Awards recognize outstanding work in design. The awards draw hundreds of entries from around the world. This year the gala was held at the City Winery in New York.</p>\n\n“It’s wonderful to see this cover recognized in this moment,” says editor Steven Boyd Saum. “It speaks to the vision behind the Peace Corps — and, more than that, to the hundreds of thousands of Volunteers and staff and partners in communities who have worked together across the decades and around the world on a mission of building peace and friendship. That work is far from finished.” \n\n<p>This marks the second year in a row that WorldView has brought home top honors in these awards. The flagship publication for the 240,000-strong Peace Corps community, WorldView has been published for more than 30 years by National Peace Corps Association. Since 2020 it has been edited by Steven Boyd Saum, who served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ukraine (1994–96), partnering with Pamela Fogg as art director.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>“It’s wonderful to see this cover recognized in this moment,” says Saum. “It speaks to the vision behind the Peace Corps — and, more than that, to the hundreds of thousands of Volunteers and staff and partners in communities who have worked together across the decades and around the world on a mission of building peace and friendship. That work is far from finished.”</p>\n<p>The award-winning cover marks Tim O’Brien’s first for WorldView — though millions around the world have seen his work. His illustrations have appeared numerous times on the cover of Time Magazine, Der Spiegel, Rolling Stone, Mother Jones, Smithsonian, and many other periodicals. They have been featured in Esquire, GQ, National Geographic, The New York Times, New York Magazine and many more. O’Brien has illustrated several U.S. postage stamps, and his paintings are among the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>In addition to winning top honors this year, WorldView was a finalist in two more categories: best full edition, for the special 60th anniversary edition; and best series of articles, for “An Anniversary. A Pandemic. Peace Corps Response.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p> </p>\nBEST COVER | WINNER!\nThe Peace Corps at Sixty | Illustration by Tim O’Brien, art direction by Pamela Fogg.\nBEST OVERALL EDITION | FINALIST\n<p>Special 60th Anniversary Edition. Six decades after this Peace Corps endeavor took flight, we ask: Where are we going? Where have we gone?</p>\nBEST SERIES OF ARTICLES | FINALIST\n<p>“An Anniversary. A Pandemic. Peace Corps Response.” Originally established as Crisis Corps in 1996, Peace Corps Response was created to send Volunteers on short-term, high-impact assignments. An important story for us to tell is that the government program has its roots in grassroots efforts by Returned Peace Corps Volunteers who were working in Rwanda when the genocide unfolded. They organized efforts to assist in refugee camps, and they inspired the government agency to harness the experience and commitment that so many Peace Corps Volunteers bring. Congratulations to the contributing writers in this series, including interns Emi Krishnamurthy, Ellery Pollard, and Sarah Steindl; and writers Hilliard Hicks and Joshua Berman.</p>\n<p> </p>",

It is one of three Sodha family puddings of choice for all major occasions (trifle and cheesecake are the others, since you ask), so it was just a matter of time before I completed the set in this column. I’m obviously biased, but I think this recipe has benefits over the original. Without traditional dairy and eggs, it is luxurious without being too rich, and instead of the elongated savoiardi biscuits, there is a flat sponge that can be cut into any shape to fit any serving dish of your choice.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p>After a mass burial site was found in the recently re-taken city of Izyum, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there is “clear evidence” of war crimes by Russian soldiers and urged the world to “react” to Moscow’s atrocities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost 450 bodies of civilians were discovered in Izyum, in the northeastern Kharkiv region, apparently victims of Russian troops, local authorities said. Alongside the civilian graves, the bodies of almost two dozen Ukrainian soldiers appeared to have been dumped in a single grave, according to Ukrainian law enforcement officials and local authorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The world must react to all this,” Zelenskyy said in his address to the nation on Friday night. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There is already clear evidence of torture and humiliating treatment of people. Moreover, there is evidence that Russian soldiers, whose positions were not far from there, shot at the buried just for fun,” Zelenskyy said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is too early to establish the exact number of people buried at the site, he said. Investigations are ongoing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Czech presidency of the Council of the EU on Saturday urged that an international tribunal for war crimes be set up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent,” Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský said in a tweet. “We must not overlook it. We stand for the punishment of all war criminals,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I call for the speedy establishment of a special international tribunal that will prosecute the crime of aggression,” Lipavský said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Izyum was retaken by Ukrainian forces a week ago in Kyiv’s surprise counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, after six months of Russian occupation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zelenskyy compared the deaths in Izyum to the discoveries in Kyiv’s suburb of Bucha, where over 400 civilians were found dead after several weeks of Russian occupation. Ukrainian authorities found mass graves as well as corpses of civilians apparently tied up and shot at close range. Ukraine has officially filed a case of war crimes against Moscow’s forces over the killings in Bucha.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian authorities have found several “torture chambers” in the liberated territories of the Kharkiv region, where imprisoned local residents as well as foreigners were kept, Zelenskyy said Friday night. Among the foreigners, seven Sri Lankan citizens — students of the local medical college — were discovered, he said.<br /><br />“Back in March, they were captured by Russian soldiers, who subsequently kept these people in the basement. Only now, after the liberation of Kharkiv region, have these people been saved. They are now being provided with proper medical care.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the deaths in Izyum “should galvanize our support” for Ukraine against Russia. “Reports of a mass grave with 440 men, women, and children in Izyum, Ukraine, are heartbreaking,” Blinken said in a tweet. “We stand with Ukraine in pursuing accountability for these crimes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc is “deeply shocked” by the discoveries in Izyum. “We condemn these atrocities in the strongest possible terms,” he said in a statement. “Russia, its political leadership, and all those involved in the ongoing violations of international law and international humanitarian law in Ukraine will be held accountable.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday evening that Russia will continue to push forward with its war on Ukraine, despite recent setbacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The plan will not be adjusted,” Putin said in the Uzbek city of Samarkand in what was his first public comment on Kyiv’s counteroffensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The main goal is to liberate the entire territory of Donbas. This work continues despite the attempts of the Ukrainian army to launch a counteroffensive,” Putin said. “Let’s see how it [the counteroffensive] unfolds and how it ends.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Justice Department has asked a federal appeals court to lift a judge’s order blocking criminal investigators from accessing about 100 documents with national security classification markings recovered from former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago compound last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a filing with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta Friday night, prosecutors said the government is facing irreparable harm as a result of U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon’s ruling putting the potentially classified records off-limits to the investigative team until an outside expert conducts a review of them and considers Trump’s objections to their seizure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The court’s order hamstrings that investigation and places the FBI and Department of Justice … under a Damoclean threat of contempt,” DOJ lawyers said in their 29-page filing, adding, “It also irreparably harms the government by enjoining critical steps of an ongoing criminal investigation and needlessly compelling disclosure of highly sensitive records, including to [Trump’s] counsel.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Justice Department’s widely expected escalation of the legal fight came one day after the Trump-appointed judge rebuffed prosecutors’ request for a stay that would essentially carve out the national security-related records — some bearing markings such as “Top Secret/SCI” — from the outside oversight Trump’s legal team requested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filing was an unsparing rejection of Cannon’s handling of the entire matter, saying it has jeopardized national security, is based on flimsy or baseless interpretations of executive privilege and could enable further obstruction of efforts to recover additional missing documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The government’s need to proceed apace is heightened where, as here, it has reason to believe that obstructive acts may impede its investigation,” prosecutors wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Cannon purported to permit the FBI to take certain steps in its criminal investigation, DOJ said her guidance was so sparse that it left the FBI “to discern that line for themselves on pain of contempt should the court later disagree with their judgments — a threat that will inevitably chill their legitimate activities.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The inability of federal prosecutors to advance their criminal probe has complicated separate efforts by the intelligence community to assess the harm that may have been caused by their improper storage in Trump’s unsecured storage room, prosecutors say, contending that the criminal investigation is inextricably tied to the national security review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And prosecutors suggested that the restrictions on the FBI’s criminal work would prevent investigators from determining what may have once resided in dozens of empty folders, also bearing classification marks, found among Trump’s belongings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The injunction also appears to bar the FBI and DOJ from further reviewing the records to discern any patterns in the types of records that were retained, which could lead to identification of other records still missing,” prosecutors indicated in the filing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday, Cannon picked a longtime federal district court judge in New York, Raymond Dearie, to serve as the so-called special master who will take the first stab at assessing Trump’s claims of executive privilege and attorney-client privilege over some or potentially all of the records seized during the Aug. 8 raid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the Justice Department’s efforts to fight various aspects of Cannon’s order, Dearie scheduled his first conference with prosecutors and Trump’s attorneys for Tuesday, at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn, where he is based. The judge, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, urged both parties to submit proposed agenda items by Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the issues they are likely to address: how Dearie will adjudicate any disputes over assertions of executive privilege by the former president, which Justice Department officials say are effectively meaningless in the context of their criminal inquiry. He’s also likely to face decisions on claims by Trump that he declassified all of the records stored at his estate, despite presenting no evidence or affidavits in court supporting the claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But DOJ emphasized that Trump and his attorneys have made no representations in court that he actually did declassify the documents at issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Despite multiple opportunities, Plaintiff has never represented that he in fact took either of those steps—much less supported such a representation with competent evidence,” prosecutors noted. “The court erred in granting extraordinary relief based on unsubstantiated possibilities.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nor has Trump actually made any formal attempt to assert executive privilege over any of the documents seized last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Even if he did, no such assertion could justify restricting the Executive Branch’s review and use of these records for multiple independent reasons,” DOJ argued. Prosecutors said the circumstances in this case undermined Trump’s potential claims of executive privilege “even more clearly than in United States v. Nixon.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Justice Department’s filing Friday at the 11th Circuit makes clear that prosecutors continue to object strongly to any role for a special master in connection with potentially classified documents. In addition, prosecutors suggest that a portion of one of Cannon’s orders directing that Trump’s lawyers be provided with copies of all the seized records is another improper intrusion on the Justice Department’s prerogatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Yet the district court here ordered disclosure of highly sensitive material to a special master and to Plaintiff’s counsel—potentially including witnesses to relevant events—in the midst of an investigation, where no charges have been brought,” prosecutors wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prosecutors did not elaborate on the reference to “witnesses,” but one attorney involved in Trump’s drive to limit prosecutors’ access to the records, Evan Corcoran, was also involved in preparing an affidavit submitted to DOJ in June claiming that all the documents marked classified had been turned over to the government. Prosecutors say that was not true.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A group of Gen-Z activists have shared video evidence that appears to show Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) kicking one of their members on a sidewalk outside of the U.S. Capitol building.</p>\n<p>Early Thursday evening, members of the progressive group Voters of Tomorrow — which seeks to increase political engagement among young people — confronted Greene and her staff, speaking to her about gun reform and the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a heated debate that was captured on video. </p>\n<p>At one point in the video, Marianna Pecora, the deputy communications director for the group, is walking alongside Greene. As space on the sidewalk narrows, Pecora steps away from Greene, walking in front of the congresswoman as they continue down the road.</p>\n<p>Although there is still room between her and Greene, the Georgia legislator appears annoyed that Pecora walked in front of her. Greene can then be seen striking the back of Pecora’s leg with her foot, causing the activist to stumble. </p>\n\n<p>I’m the Deputy Communications Director @VotersTomorrow and our team is in DC this week to lobby for youth rights. </p>\n<p>All the members of Congress we’ve met with so far (both Rs and Ds) have been nothing but respectful — except for @RepMTG. She kicked me. pic.twitter.com/vDCc3svIEZ</p>\n<p>— Marianna Pecora (@MariannaPecora) September 15, 2022</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When Pecora and other group members complain about Greene’s actions, the lawmaker dismisses them. The video goes on to show a spokesperson for Greene telling the organization’s members, “You can’t block members of Congress” on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>Greene has confronted young activists on sidewalks in Washington D.C. in the past, using her phone to film their interactions and post them to social media. Such was the case when she harassed Parkland school shooting survivor David Hogg in 2019.</p>\n<p>Instead of apologizing for kicking the activist, Greene shared the video of her striking Pecora on her Twitter account, calling those who confronted her “foolish cowards.” Pecora responded to Greene’s post by quoting it in a tweet of her own.</p>\n<p>“Did she literally just tweet out the video of her kicking me?” Pecora asked.</p>\n<p>In a different post, Pecora noted that Greene was the only lawmaker who responded to the group with hostility. “All the members of Congress we’ve met with so far (both Rs and Ds) have been nothing but respectful — except for @RepMTG,” Pecora said.</p>\n<p>“It’s honestly, like, really disheartening to think that a bunch of kids can hold themselves with better composure than a sitting member of Congress,” Pecora said in a subsequent interview with The Washington Post.</p>\n<p>The same day Greene kicked Pecora, she verbally lashed out at Voters of Tomorrow executive director Santiago Mayer, telling him to “go to another country” if he disagreed with gun laws in the U.S. </p>\n<p>Mayer, who moved to the country from Mexico in 2017, pointed out that Greene wasn’t the only GOP lawmaker who acted out against the organizers.</p>\n<p>“Also [Colorado Republican Congresswoman] Lauren Boebert tried to knock my phone off my hand,” Mayer said.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Enlarge / Teenager playing fetch with her dog (credit: Anchiy via Getty Images)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Three years ago, Valli Fraser-Celin adopted a blonde husky mix puppy, whom she named Husk. Fraser-Celin soon started looking for ways to curb Husk’s “totally wild” behavior, she said, like stealing food from the kitchen counter and barking incessantly at strangers. Based on the advice of a YouTube trainer, Fraser-Celin started using an electronic collar, or e-collar, that delivered a small shock when Husk misbehaved, but said she felt “yucky” about it.</p>\n<p>Fraser-Celin rethought her approach after hearing about an animal trainer who taught a grizzly bear to cooperate with medical treatment using only positive reinforcement. If that hulking animal could learn with treats and praise, she thought, why were dog trainers using prong and shock collars? “That was the catalyst into my advocacy,” said Fraser-Celin, who studied African wild dogs for her Ph.D. and now works as a remote community liaison for the Winnipeg Humane Society and advocates independently for positive reinforcement training on Instagram. “I really think that there needs to be regulations that are put into place,” she said, “based on the science and the studies that have shown the best type of training for dogs.”</p>\n<p>Fraser-Celin is not alone. Many researchers, trainers, and veterinary and training professional organizations are advocating for greater oversight for dog training, which is largely unregulated worldwide—though they sometimes disagree on the best path of action and choose to focus on the research that reinforces their preferred approach. “Right now, it’s the wild, wild West,” said Anamarie Johnson, a psychology Ph.D. student at Arizona State University with a background in animal behavior and dog training. She recently published a study that analyzed the websites of 100 highly-rated dog trainers across the US, which found that most gave no indication whether the trainer had relevant education or certification.</p><p>Read 24 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

        "description": "Dan Brink\n    \n\n  <p>The Yankees lost a tough one, and Aaron Judge stayed put in his home run chase.</p> <p>Welcome back to the Aaron Judge Home Run Record Tracker! We’re taking a daily look at where Aaron Judge’s monster season tracks compared to some of the other historic single-season home run leaders in anticipation of Judge potentially joining their ranks. We’ll be going by Team Game because not every player’s seasons were in sync with the calendar days and everyone didn’t play all of the team’s games, which makes this our universal standard. Let’s run through Game 144:</p>\nAaron Judge through Game 144 of 2022: 57 HR\n<p>Team Game 144: 9/16 — 2-for-4, 2 1B, 2 R, 1 BB, 1 K</p>\n<p>Judge remains one homer clear of Roger Maris’ pace, unable to homer in game one in Milwaukee. He did manage one of the most non-Judge like hits possible with his second-inning single:</p>\n\n\n<p>Everything just goes Aaron Judge's waypic.twitter.com/8yvbGHTsh5</p>— Yankees Videos (@snyyankees) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Even on a quiet night, Judge still manage to reach base three times, but it wasn’t enough in a frustrating loss.</p>\nRoger Maris through Game 144 of 1961: 56 HR\n<p>Team Game 144: 9/10 (1) — 1-for-3, 1 1B, 2 RBI, 1 BB</p>\n<p>This marked the beginning of a rare cold stretch during Maris’ 1961, with Maris cooling off after a red-hot stretch that saw him homer in three out of four games. Maris did contribute a two-run single that gave the Yankees a 4-2 lead in the second, and they would go on to defeat Cleveland 7-6 in the front end of a doubleheader.</p>\nBabe Ruth through Game 144 of 1927: 53 HR\n<p>Team Game 144: 9/17 (1) — 0-for-1, 1 R, 3 BB</p>\n<p>Not much Ruth could do here; if the opponent doesn’t want to pitch to you, you can’t hit all that many homers. Ruth would ultimately lead the majors in walks in 1927, with Lou Gehrig finishing runner-up in both the walks and homers categories. The Yankees squeezed out a 3-2 win over the White Sox in the first of a doubleheader, thanks to a complete game from Urban Shocker that featured zero walks and one strikeout.</p>\nBarry Bonds through Game 144 of 2001: 63 HR\n<p>Team Game 144: 9/9 — 3-for-5, 3 HR, 5 RBI, 3 R, 1 BB, 1 K</p>\n<p>Just a spectacular game for Bonds. Playing his last game at Coors Field for the season, Bonds took full advantage, smashing three bombs to shoot his total to 63:</p>\n\n<p>While his first homer was the kind of majestic high fly we associate with him, Bonds absolutely smoked his second and third dingers, with each clearing the right field wall in what felt like less than a second. Bonds only recorded 99 plate appearances between 2001 and 2004 at Coors, but in those 99, he hit .453/.576/1.027 (yes, that’s a slugging over 1.000, not an OPS), with 12 dingers. </p>\nMark McGwire through Game 144 of 1998: 61 HR\n<p>Team Game 144: 9/7 — 2-for-4, 1 HR, 1 RBI, 1 R</p>\n<p>The main takeaway I’ve found from working through this series is just how damn fun the ‘98 chase seemed to be. McGwire didn’t sit on 60 homers for long, tying Roger Maris’ record of 61 homers with a bomb down the left-field line: </p>\n\n<p>Magically, this came against the Cubs, with Sammy Sosa looking on from right field. In the clip above, you can see Sosa give a small fist pump of encouragement to his rival as McGwire rounded the bases.</p>\nSammy Sosa through Game 144 of 1998: 58 HR\n<p>Team Game 144: 9/7 — 1-for-5, 1 1B, 3 K</p>\n<p>Sosa had to watch McGwire become the first man since Maris to hit 61 homers, and he wasn’t able to make up any ground in the overall chase, managing only a single in a 3-2 loss to St. Louis. Sammy would eventually tighten up the race again, but only one of them was going to be able to get to Maris first, and it was McGwire.</p>\n<p></p>",

He hasn’t had many days off lately. He’s been doing a really nice job for us,” said David Ross.\nTony Andracki (Marquee Sports Network*): Jared Young out to ‘prove myself right’ in opportunity with Cubs. “It’s exciting.

        "description": "<p>Enlarge / Teenager playing fetch with her dog (credit: Anchiy via Getty Images)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Three years ago, Valli Fraser-Celin adopted a blonde husky mix puppy, whom she named Husk. Fraser-Celin soon started looking for ways to curb Husk’s “totally wild” behavior, she said, like stealing food from the kitchen counter and barking incessantly at strangers. Based on the advice of a YouTube trainer, Fraser-Celin started using an electronic collar, or e-collar, that delivered a small shock when Husk misbehaved, but said she felt “yucky” about it.</p>\n<p>Fraser-Celin rethought her approach after hearing about an animal trainer who taught a grizzly bear to cooperate with medical treatment using only positive reinforcement. If that hulking animal could learn with treats and praise, she thought, why were dog trainers using prong and shock collars? “That was the catalyst into my advocacy,” said Fraser-Celin, who studied African wild dogs for her Ph.D. and now works as a remote community liaison for the Winnipeg Humane Society and advocates independently for positive reinforcement training on Instagram. “I really think that there needs to be regulations that are put into place,” she said, “based on the science and the studies that have shown the best type of training for dogs.”</p>\n<p>Fraser-Celin is not alone. Many researchers, trainers, and veterinary and training professional organizations are advocating for greater oversight for dog training, which is largely unregulated worldwide—though they sometimes disagree on the best path of action and choose to focus on the research that reinforces their preferred approach. “Right now, it’s the wild, wild West,” said Anamarie Johnson, a psychology Ph.D. student at Arizona State University with a background in animal behavior and dog training. She recently published a study that analyzed the websites of 100 highly-rated dog trainers across the US, which found that most gave no indication whether the trainer had relevant education or certification.</p><p>Read 24 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

The homer was notable as Pruett had struck out Ruth in 9 of 10 at-bats coming in.  </p>\n<p>1947 - The Sporting News names Jackie Robinson as Rookie of the Year two weeks before the season is over. </p>\n<p>1953 - Ernie Banks goes hitless at the plate and make an error in his major league debut as the Cubs fall 16-4 to the Phillies. Banks is the first black player to play for the Cubs. </p>\n<p>1963 - Sandy Koufax tosses his 11th shutout and strikes out eight giving him 306 for the season which sets a new National League record. </p>\n<p>1979 - George Brett notches his 20th triple of the season in a 16-4 win over the Angels. Brett is the sixth player ever and the first since Willie Mays in 1957 to have 20 doubles, 20 triples and 20 home runs in the same season. </p>\n<p>1986 - Dwight Gooden and the Mets defeat the Cubs 4-2 to clinch the NL Eaast division. New York will go on to win 108 games and the World Series. </p>\n<p>1999 - Cal Ripken Jr. calls the Orioles to tell them that he is delayed in traffic but will be arriving in the next 10 minutes. However, GM Frank Wren orders that the plate take off without Ripken who arrives at the gate a few minutes later and is forced to make his own travel arrangements. Wren will be fired at the end of the season. </p>\n\n<p>Information for this article was found via Baseball Reference, NationalPastime.com and Today in Baseball History.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>Sept. 17 is designated by federal law as Constitution Day to commemorate the signing of the U.S. Constitution on Sept. 17, 1787. The U.S. Supreme Court is responsible in the American system of separation of powers for deciding what the Constitution means in specific cases. The first Monday in October marks the beginning of a new Supreme Court term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The court’s previous term was the most conservative in nearly a century. The nation’s highest court overruled its two landmark pro-abortion rights precedents, expanded Second Amendment gun rights, reinvigorated the First Amendment’s free-exercise-of-religion guarantee against establishment-of-religion clause challenges and reined in the rulemaking authority of executive branch administrative agencies on the ground that only Congress is permitted to make law.<br /><br />The court’s six-member conservative majority arrived at most of these results by turning to history to understand the meaning of the Constitution’s text. Specifically, in what may be fairly called “conservative originalism,” the court endeavored to enforce the Constitution’s “original meaning” by opining about historical sources that illuminate what the men (and it was only men in 1787) who wrote and ratified the Constitution intended for the textual provision at issue in a particular case to mean.<br /><br />Of course, it is impossible for Supreme Court justices who are trained as lawyers rather than as historians and who decide scores of cases on the merits every year to do the historical research for themselves, notwithstanding that they each are assisted by four bright recent law school graduates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Justice Clarence Thomas (the court’s longest serving justice and its most unabashed proponent of conservative originalism) admitted as much in what court watchers should consider the most significant footnote since footnote 4 in the court’s 1938 decision United States v. Carolene Products Company.<br /><br />In Carolene Products, the court upheld a federal law regulating “filled” milk, an imitation or adulterated milk product. Justice Harlan Fiske Stone, writing for the court, declared that the justices would no longer subject economic legislation to heightened scrutiny, but would instead now apply minimal scrutiny that was deferential to the legislature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Justice Stone then inserted a footnote (footnote 4) that declared that the court would continue to apply heightened scrutiny in situations in which a law conflicts with Bill of Rights protections, where the political process is malfunctioning and when regulations adversely affect “discrete and insular minorities.” Concisely put, footnote 4 ushered in a new role for the federal courts in the American constitutional order.<br /><br />Jumping ahead nearly a century to the court’s most recent transformational footnote, Justice Thomas wrote the following in footnote 6 in the court’s 2022 decision expanding Second Amendment gun rights: “The job of judges is not to resolve historical questions in the abstract; it is to resolve legal questions presented in particular cases or controversies.” He continued: “That ‘legal inquiry is a refined subset’ of a broader ‘historical inquiry,’ and it relies on ‘various evidentiary principles and default rules’ to resolve uncertainties.” Finally, and most importantly: “Courts are thus entitled to decide a case based on the historical record compiled by the parties.”<br /><br />Thomas should be commended for acknowledging in footnote 6 that the justices don’t do their own historical research. But unfortunately for conservative originalists, what he says in that footnote calls into question the entirety of conservative originalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, lawyers are notorious for cherry-picking history to try to get the result their clients are paying them to get. As Pulitzer-Prize winning historian Gordon Wood put it in a public debate about the Supreme Court and the uses of history: “Judges have to invent another kind of history: we call it ‘law office history,’ or ‘history lite.’ … It’s a necessary fiction for judges and other jurists to get along with their work—they need some kind of history to work with. History is much too complicated to be used effectively by judges and the courts.”<br /><br />I agree with Dr. Wood. Consequently, my answer to the question whether Supreme Court justices should use history to decide cases is a qualified yes. This is what I mean by that: They should use history to identify the political philosophy of the American founding and then decide cases in light of that political philosophy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, judges should employ “liberal originalism,” which is “liberal” in the classical Lockean libertarian sense that the principal purpose of government is to protect individual rights, and it is “originalism” in the sense that the Framers wrote the Constitution with that principal purpose of government in mind. “To secure these rights,” the Declaration of Independence proclaims, “Governments are instituted among Men.”<br /><br />Liberal originalism and conservative originalism sometimes (though not often because conservative originalism tends to be majoritarian rather than libertarian) lead to the same result in specific cases. To mention one example from the court’s most recent term, liberal originalism, like conservative originalism, reveals that the establishment clause doesn’t make the free-exercise clause meaningless. The political philosophy that the Constitution was adopted to effectuate reveals that America has been devoted since before the First Amendment was ratified to the free exercise of religion, which is a quintessential individual right.<br /><br />Scott Douglas Gerber is a law professor at Ohio Northern University and an associated scholar at Brown University’s Political Theory Project. His nine books include “To Secure These Rights: The Declaration of Independence and Constitutional Interpretation.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>WNBA star Brittney Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner,  thanked President Biden in a statement Saturday for meeting with her over the player's detainment in Russia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activists have been pushing Biden for months to get Griner back home after she was detained at an airport by Russian officials in February for having vape cartridges with hashish oil, a form of cannabis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Griner pleaded guilty in Russian court earlier this summer and was sentenced to nine years in prison. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden met with Griner’s family, along with the family of former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, who is also detained in Russia, on Friday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I want to thank President Biden for today’s meeting. It was an honor to speak with him directly about the Brittney we know and love, and to thank him for the Administration’s efforts to secure her release,” Cherelle Griner wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Biden administration has said both Griner and Whelan have been unlawfully detained, but the government has not been able to secure their release amid high tensions between the U.S. and Russia over the war in Ukraine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’ve felt every minute of the grueling seven months without her. I look forward to the day my wife is back home. As my family and I continue on this journey, I’d like to thank the broad coalition of friends, leaders and supporters who continue to stand with us and advocate for Brittney’s swift and safe return,” Cherelle Griner said. “Let’s share a unified commitment to bringing all Americans home to their families and loved ones. Together We Are BG.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Biden administration was able to secure the release of former Marine Trevor Reed, another American that was detained in Russia, back in May. The government exchanged a jailed Russian national in the U.S. convicted on drug trafficking charges for Reed. </p>",

        "description": "Photo by John Fisher/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Julio Urías starts for the Dodgers on Saturday night, having established himself as the ace on a Dodgers team that will win 100 games for the fourth time in six seasons.</p>\n<p>He’s on an incredible run, with a 1.94 ERA in his last 15 starts, of which the Dodgers have won 14. Urías has allowed nine total runs in his last 10 starts.</p>\n<p>Jorge Castillo of the Los Angeles Times went to Culiacán, Mexico — Urías’ hometown — to visit the pitcher’s family. Castillo’s excellent profile is chock full of interesting nuggets, like Urías having 10 eye surgeries before turning 10, how the left-hander plans to end his career pitching for the Tomateros de Culiacán, plus a response to San Diego hecklers, and how Urías has grown into becoming an ace.</p>\n<p>Also included was Urías asked about his 20-game suspension under MLB’s joint domestic violence policy in 2019 after an altercation in a Los Angeles parking lot during which video showed Urías pushed a woman to the ground.</p>\n<p>“I don’t even like to talk about it or remember it because they’re very complicated moments in life that you don’t want to see yourself or another person in that situation,” Urías told Castillo. “It was a lesson and I feel like if I have a stain, it’s that one.”</p>\n<p>Urías also came up this week when Scott Boras was a guest this week on the Effectively Wild podcast at FanGraphs, with Ben Lindbergh and Meg Rowley. Among the topics discussed were the upside of an agency and team working together to optimize player performance.</p>\n<p>“Andrew Friedman and I talked about Julio Urías,” Boras said. “This guy was a precocious star, and I think collectively we did a great job at getting him where his innings are not anywhere like where he’s throwing 1,000 innings before he was 25 years old. </p>\n<p>“He was titrated and managed, and now we’re getting a Cy Young-level performance out of a 25-year-old, exactly how it’s prescribed. He doesn’t have a lot of innings on him. There’s an example of working together to really bring a very beneficial outcome for both team and player.”</p>\n<p>Urías, who turned 26 on August 7, leads the National League this season with a 2.30 ERA, and is the only member of the Dodgers opening day rotation to avoid the injured list in 2022. Urías, who now has pitched 577⅓ innings in his career, will be a free agent after the 2023 season at age 27. </p>\nLinks\n\nTrea Turner talked about his pending free agency, how he and the Dodgers mutually agreed to not talk contract during the season after initial spring discussions, and the lingering “prefers the east cost” narrative with Bill Plunkett at the Orange County Register.\nMax Muncy talked more about his turnaround this season, and how his step-back move came from trying to mimic Nolan Arenado. “The idea was “all of ours and none of ours at the same time,” Muncy said,” per Plunkett at the OC Register.\nTrayce Thompson’s resurgence with the Dodgers was pored over by Jay Jaffe at FanGraphs, who is a fan of his batted-ball data.\nThe Dodgers pitching plan for the postseason is still very much a work in progress, Jack Harris at the LA Times detailed.\n\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

From its tightly spaced keys and capacitive touch function row to its minimal port selection, questionable build quality, and extremely high temperatures, this machine can be frustrating to use for daily tasks.</p><p>Read 45 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

        "description": "Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Colorado Rockies news and links for Saturday, September 17, 2022 </p> <p>In what was supposed to be an upstart season with Kris Bryant steering the organization back in the direction of contention, the Colorado Rockies cemented their fourth straight losing season with a 2-1 loss to the Chicago Cubs on Friday. It was their 82nd of the season with 18 games still left to play.</p>\n<p>During the team’s floundering season, Bryant has appeared in just 42 games and the odds are against him appearing in any more. A return hasn’t officially been ruled out, and he has resumed some moderate baseball activities, but his chances of being healthy enough to play before the schedule runs out are not favorable.</p>\n<p>The only real reason for Bryant to return to the field is to simply show he can. Losing the first of a seven-year pact has stung the Colorado franchise, and surely they would appreciate any positive signs from their investment before the season runs out. Because, with six years and $164 million remaining on his contract, Kris Bryant isn’t going anywhere any time soon.</p>\n\n\n<p>Medical update from Kris Bryant: pic.twitter.com/Hc1dGfJ2fr</p>— Mark Gonzales (@MDGonzales) September 16, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>To say Kris Bryant’s first season has been a letdown would be an understatement. When he has played, he has been reasonably productive. An .851 OPS is eye-popping, especially when compared to the rest of the Colorado roster, and a 126 OPS+ is the type of season figure you’d expect from one of the game’s better hitters. But it took 23 games for him to hit a home run and if you average his totals in 181 plate appearances over 162 games it comes out to just 19 home runs for the season, a steep drop from his prime days with Chicago.</p>\n<p>But there is a grain of salt to be taken with these numbers. The injury bug has plagued Bryant multiple times in 2022, chewing large stretches of games at a time. He missed 21 games after the first IL stint in April. After returning for two games in May, Bryant went down for another 33 games until late June. After suiting up through all of July, plantar fasciitis set in and has kept Bryant out for the last 41 games.</p>\n<p>This game of red-light/green-light with Bryant’s health surely affected his production when he was on the field, making it easy to believe his performance was hindered in some way or another when he was in the lineup. But it speaks to the overall lack of Bryant’s first year. In fact, Colorado’s newest investment is lacking more than any other team’s has before. </p>\n\n<p>Of free agent contracts for position players totaling $100 million or more, no player has played fewer games in their first season than Bryant with the Rockies. Anthony Rendon, whose contract with the Angels is already being viewed as one of the worst in baseball, is the next closest in games lost during a full-season. In fact, if you want to get technical and include the abbreviated 2020 season, this still applies as Rendon appeared in 52 of those 60 games.</p>\n<p>Envisioning Bryant’s deal becoming an albatross on the level of Rendon’s or Yoenis Céspedes’ – a contract the New York Mets have successfully fought to devalue – is a scary proposition on its own for those that want to see the Rockies succeed. But it gets even worse when you add context to how lost a year 2022 has really been, and how it could be just the first level of seven.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the fact that Kris Bryant still has more games played with the San Francisco Giants (51) than he does with the Rockies, despite only spending two months in 2021 calling San Francisco home.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, his total games missed is set to be the most of any Rockies’ position player making $3,600,000 or more in a single season. Troy Tulowitzki, the prime example of a fragile star label, never played in fewer than 47 games in a season with the Rockies. This also includes Ian Desmond, who forfeited at least $13.5 million by electing to sit both the 2020 and 2021 seasons. The only thing that keeps this financial bar from being any lower is 2B José López, who was under contract for $3.6 million in 2011 but only lasted 38 games with Colorado before being released.</p>\n<p>Kris Bryant made $18 million in 2022, though, approximately 13% of Colorado’s total payroll. His annual salary will balloon to $27 million for the next two before settling at $26 million for the final four years of 2025-2028. A middle-market team like Colorado can survive lost seasons from moderately priced role-players, but not from their highest-paid core pieces. That lesson was learned the hard way during the Tulo/Cargo years of 2011-2014. </p>\n<p>This is not to say that Kris Bryant cannot return to a healthy form, both in the short-term perspective of this season and (more importantly) over the remaining life of his contract. His signing has always made the most sense when being viewed through a prism that focuses on the next generation of a competitive Rockies roster arriving. That plan can still come to fruition — the front office has 168 million reasons to believe it will — but there is no denying it has gotten off to a very turbulent start, a start worse than any other big spending franchise has experienced so far.</p>\n<p>★ ★ ★</p>\nColorado Rockies GM Bill Schmidt: 1-on-1 on Kris Bryant, 2023 needs, more | Rox Pile\n<p>Kevin Henry over at Rox Pile provides an insightful interview with Rockies’ GM Bill Schmidt, hitting on some of his general takeaways from the 2022 season. After singing praise for Alan Trejo’s performance in José  Iglesias’ absence and Garrett Hampson’s defensive defensive capabilities, Schmidt looks forward to Ezequiel Tovar one day while emphasizing the goal right now is to focus on his rehabilitation instead of forcing a promotion to the majors. </p>\n<p>Schmidt also speaks on the lost season of Kris Bryant, noting his absence in the lineup this season being too big a task to overcome. He also takes time to discuss the debuts of Michael Toglia and Sean Bouchard before touching on ideas to improve the roster in the future: </p>\n<p>“Ideally, we probably need to try to find a center fielder and ideally a leadoff type guy. Is that the same person? Hopefully it is. We also need to add some speed somewhere,” Schmidt said. “We have pieces. I said last year we have pieces and we need to get more. It hasn’t changed. We’re getting more pieces, but there are still pieces we need to be the type of club we want to be.”</p>\n<p>★ ★ ★</p>\nOn The Farm\n<p>Triple-A: Oklahoma City Dodgers 12, Albuquerque Isotopes 9</p>\n<p>It was a tough night for Albuquerque pitching. The theme for starter Karl Kauffmann was five, as that’s how many hits, walks and runs he allowed before departing in the fifth inning. Relievers Matt Dennis, Nick Kennedy and J.D. Hammer didn’t fare much better, combining to allow seven runs over the next 2 2⁄3 innings. </p>\n<p>But while the outcome of the game was flop, there were highlights along the way. First was Ezequiel Tovar’s first Triple-A home run, coming in the third inning.</p>\n\n\n<p>First Triple-A jack for Ezequiel Tovar!<br /><br />The @Rockies' No. 2 prospect singled in his @ABQTopes debut last night, before taking it up a notch with his 14th homer of 2022: pic.twitter.com/ECHXOGPH0m</p>— MLB Pipeline (@MLBPipeline) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>After that, down 12-4 in the eighth, Wynton Bernard made history with Albuquerque’s 14th grand slam of the season, setting a Minor League record for most in a season by any team.</p>\n\n\n<p>Want to see history?

But Williams was able to straighten the ship for just one run over the next five innings, finishing with an electric 12 strikeouts to just one walk over his six innings pitched. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it didn’t matter much how Williams fared as the Hartford offense was unable to generate any momentum throughout the game. The Yard Goats tallied just three hits over nine innings while striking out 11 times themselves.</p>\n<p>★ ★ ★</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind our Purple Row Community Guidelines when you’re commenting.

Rudy Law [right] just wanted to drink out of a massive champagne bottle. | Bruce Bennett Studios via Getty Images/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Offensive outbursts, 36 years apart</p> 1971\n<p>The White Sox defeated the California Angels, 9-4, at Comiskey Park. An unusual event marked this game: All nine players in the White Sox lineup that night got one RBI — including pitcher Bart Johnson, who started, gave up eight hits, and struck out 12 in going the distance. </p>\n\n1983\n<p>Before a packed house at Comiskey Park, Harold Baines hit a sacrifice fly to drive in Julio Cruz with the run that won the American League West title for the White Sox. The 4-3 win over Seattle marked the first time the White Sox had ever won the AL West. The Sox would go on to the playoffs for the first time in 24 years, draw a then-record 2,132,821 fans, finish with the best record in baseball (99-63) and win the division by a record 20 games over second-place Kansas City. </p>\n\n1984\n<p>Harold Baines became the only player in White Sox history to have more than one game with three home runs. </p>\n<p>Baines had his first three-homer game in July 1982. On this day at Minnesota, he’d club three more in a 7-3 win. with four RBIs. The win also knocked the Twins out of first place in the AL West.  </p>\n\n2007\n<p>The White Sox tied the club record for the most runs ever scored in the fifth inning of a game, when they sent 11 players home at Kansas City. In addition to the 11 runs, they also collected 10 hits and three homers (Danny Richar, Jermaine Dye and Josh Fields). </p>\n<p>Richar, Jerry Owens and Fields all had two hits, and Fields drove in four runs in the inning. Four times the Sox have scored 11 runs in the fourth inning in their history — this was the most recent time it’s been done.</p>\n\n2012\n<p>Rain had rescued the flailing White Sox on September 13, postponing a finale of a series against the hard-charging Tigers, who had closed to within a game of Chicago in first place. The makeup game was squeezed in on an off-day Monday four days later, and the rest (and a three-game sweep of Minnesota) had done the White Sox good. The South Siders eked out a 5-4 win, to get back to three games up on Detroit. </p>\n<p>Alex Rios keyed a comeback in the game; with the White Sox down, 4-3, he walked and later crashed into Tigers second baseman Omar Infante to force a throwing error on a potential double play to end the fifth inning. Adam Dunn and Paul Konerko scored (no small feat) the tying and eventual winning runs. The Sox bullpen (Nate Jones, Donnie Veal, Brett Myers, Matt Thornton and Addison Reed) threw five scoreless innings of one-hit ball to ice the victory; Jones improved to 8-0 on the season.</p>\n<p>Just nine days later, however, the White Sox had fallen out of first place — for good.</p>\n\n2020\n<p>In a most bizarre, strange, and unusual pandemic season, the White Sox made the most of it by clinching a spot in the expanded playoffs. The clinching game was a come-from-behind win to beat the Twins, 4-3, getting two runs in the seventh inning. The win ran Chicago’s record to 33-17, best in the American League at the time, and put them in position to win their division for the first time since 2008 — the last time the franchise made the postseason. </p>\n<p>However, the White Sox faltered down the stretch and ended the shortened season one game behind Minnesota.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Two minor league pitchers are featured in today’s Astros review.</p> \nThroughout the 2022-23 offseason, Crawfish Boxes will be reviewing every player to appear at any level of the Houston Astros system through this past season.\n\nCesar Rojas\n<p>Cesar Rojas is a six-foot-three, 162 lb. right-handed relief pitcher from San Cristobal, DR. Born on May 12, 2002, Rojas signed with the Astros on March 17, 2021. </p>\n<p>Rojas didn’t get assigned to a specific affiliate until over a year later, when he joined the DSL Astros Orange on June 3. He has since appeared in 11 contests. In 11 2⁄3 innings with the rookie-level club, he’s walked 33 and thrown 11 wild pitches while striking out 13. He’s also given up 24 runs (18 earned) on 10 hits for a 13.89 ERA. </p>\n<p>Rojas will begin the 2023 professional season already 21-years-of-age, and is unlikely to be retained in Houston’s system. </p>\nRyan Gusto\n<p>Right-handed pitcher Ryan Gusto is a six-foot-four draftee out of Florida SouthWestern State College. Born on March 11, 1999, Charlotte, NC native Gusto was an 11th round selection of the Astros in 2019. Taken 346th overall off the board, he’d be the ninth player chosen at that spot of the draft if he gets to the major leagues. </p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>Gusto signed with the Astros shortly after the draft for $421,699, and was initially assigned to the Tri-City ValleyCats in the now-defunct New York-Penn League. He totaled five games between the Cats and the Rookie-level GCL Astros, striking out 19 and walking seven in 14 2⁄3 innings. Gusto only surrendered six hits during that time for a .122 opposing batting average. </p>\n<p>Gusto didn’t appear in another contest for the Astros until the 2022 campaign. Assigned to the Fayetteville Woodpeckers in Low-A to start the season, Gusto took four turns in the rotation and appeared once out of the bullpen for the birds. He struck out a batter-per-inning through 24 frames, while walking eight and allowing 15 hits for a sub-1 WHIP. His best game was on April 30, when he earned the victory after pitching six shutout innings, allowing one walk and two hits in a 2-1 win against the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers. </p>\n<p>On May 10, Gusto got assigned up a level to the High-A Asheville Tourists. After walking four and striking out four in three innings of his debut on May 12, he went on the injured list for a few weeks. </p>\n<p>Once Gusto returned, he surrendered an opposing slash line of .315/.370/.587/ and a 9.35 ERA over 43 1⁄3 innings. It was only through the last four games of the season with the Tourists that Gusto showed a little moxie, striking out 17 in 16 innings and holding opposing batters to a .175 average. </p>\n<p>Gusto’s June and July were truly months to forget for him, but outside of that, he seems to be a pretty decent prospect with a fastball that tops out at 96 MPH. It looks like those two months were the exception rather than the rule, and with that in mind, Gusto could be on track to make an appearance with the Astros sometime in 2025. </p>\n<p>Thanks for reading. Check back every day until spring training as we review two Houston Astros players daily. </p>",

When Rina Sawayama’s debut album, Sawayama, landed in April 2020, it not only chimed with the mood of the day, it coincided with the intensity of lockdown. Sawayama was a head-spinning record that itself turned a fair few heads. Its big emotions and post-ironic sonics called to disrupted lives everywhere. It was often very good. It was also often bad, particularly when it was pointlessly tendentious.</p><p>The singer eloquently itemised the pain of her childhood and her vexed relationship with her mother, a Japanese woman raising her daughter alone in Britain in straitened circumstances. Sawayama went in hard on racist microaggressions, and she sang about her sexuality (she identifies as pansexual) and finding her chosen family in a set of songs that thumbed their collective nose at genre – nothing wrong there – but also at all subtlety. The album paired scything violins with hokey metal riffs, melodies from Broadway musicals with edgy digitals. Fortunately, Sawayama’s big voice and searing intelligence – she is a Cambridge graduate – also threw itself at 90s pop structures, wrapped itself around retro R&amp;B.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p> </p>\n<p>Mark Himelstein<br />\nSeptember 19, 1939 – September 12, 2022</p>\n<p>Mark Himelstein died on Monday 12 September, a week before his 83rd birthday. He was battling hereditary issues with his heart when he lost. He is survived by his wife Nancy, his two sons Matt and Sam, his two daughters-in-law Laura and Alicia, and his grandchildren Solomon, Malakai, Meyer and Rhodes. Mark joins his daughter Suzy in the afterlife.</p>\n<p>Mark grew up in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He was a fan of baseball and basketball, as is Indiana tradition. Mark graduated from Indiana University with a BA in 1962 and from George Washington University Law School with an LLB in 1967. But if you ever met Mark you would know that he considered his service as a reserve in the Marines (1959-65) and his experience in the Peace Corp (Ethiopia, 1962-64) as the core learning experiences of his life.</p>\n<p>Mark found the legal profession satisfying and excelled at being a “country lawyer,” albeit he ended up making oral arguments at the Supreme Court (Smith v. Regents of University of California). Out of Law school he moved to San Francisco, California in 1969 and formed a law firm with his three partners Penrod, Sims and Savinar. Each of the partners took three months off every year – in two and one month increments. Mark moved to San Francisco, California in 1969. He was “tricked” into a double-date evening-dinner in Berkeley by mutual friends Sharon and David where he was introduced to Nancy – whom he would marry in 1978.</p>\n<p>In 1980 Mark, Nancy and two other families bought a lot in Serene Lakes, on which they built a traditional log cabin. Mark and Nancy take their 6-month-old Matt on a backpacking trip to Cascade Lake where he is “baptized by the mountain”, formalizing his association with the area. With Serene Lakes as his base, Mark served as President of the Serene Lakes Properties Organization Association (SLPOA), a member of the SLPOA board, a member of the Serene Lakes County Water District Board, and a member of the Donor Summit Association Board. He lobbied for the Serene Lakes to be renamed Ice Lakes several times, but even that was further warmed by the calmness of the area. Mark rarely misses the opportunity to attend the opening and closing of Serene Lakes Beach, BBQs and other events.</p>\n<p>Mark not only loved to tell stories, he loved to repeat them. To the point where his friends numbered them – #35 was a cult favorite. One of Mark’s favorite stories was about his quest to enable the building of the snack shack on Lot 1 in Serene Lakes. One of his proof points for the need of a building with bathrooms was that the water in the area around the beach was so much warmer than elsewhere in the lakes. The “very warm water”, he argued, would stop with the advent of bathrooms on Lot 1. Apparently this resonated with the community and a new snack shack was built.</p>\n<p>Part of Mark’s caring for others could be seen in his very progressive politics, though tempered with what he’d say was common-sense. Trump so irritated him that he pressed friends to contribute to a full-page ad in the local newspaper telling Trump to take a hike, that the fresh air would be good for his disposition. For him it was a good outlet for frustration when the world was not going in the direction his philosophy of life thought it should go.</p>\n<p>In 2010 Mark and Nancy moved up to Serene Lakes full time. Mark loved the people, the community activities, riding his bike, paddling his paddle board, hiking, skiing (downhill, cross country, and skate skiing), in-line skating (until the roads got too rough), and walking his giant chocolate lab named Cuzco.</p>\n<p>Mark was a father, a friend, and a husband, in no particular order. He made the world a better place while having a lot of fun. He lived a remarkable life ranging from helping Ethiopian tribes build schools to making expert gin martinis at his home bar. His wit exhilarated (and somewhat antagonized) his wife while his “million megawatt” smile lit up the room. He will be missed greatly. Rest in peace.</p>\n<p>Published by the San Francisco Chronicle on September 15, 2022.</p>\n<p>•</p>\n<p>From the Ethiopia 1962 Peace Corps “funny book”</p>\n<p>Mark received his B.A. in social sciences in 1962, from Indiana University.

        "description": "Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>LA has 99 wins with 19 games remaining in the season</p> <p>The Dodgers got back on the winning track by beating the Giants on Friday in San Francisco, and in doing so notched their 99th victory of the season, keeping them on pace to set a few franchise records in 2022.</p>\nBest Dodgers record\n<p>The most Dodgers wins in a single season is 106, accomplished in each of the last two full seasons (2019 and 2021). At 99-44, the 2022 squad is on pace to beat that record, needing only to finish 8-11 to set a new mark.</p>\n<p>In 2019, the Dodgers were 92-51 through 143 games on their way to 106 wins. In 2021 at this point in the season, Los Angeles was 90-53.</p>\n<p>As good as those 2019 and 2021 teams were, the 2020 team was 43-17 (.717) en route to winning the World Series, the best winning percentage in franchise history. But that was only a 60-game season. </p>\n<p>Going by full-season Dodgers teams only, the best winning percentage was by the Superbas in 1899 (101-47, .6824), narrowly edging the 1953 Brooklyn team (105-49, .6818).</p>\n<p>This year’s Dodgers have a .692 winning percentage through 143 games, still ahead of those teams’ paces. To reach the top winning percentage over a full season in Dodgers history, the 2022 team needs 111 wins, which would require a 12-7 finish.</p>\nNational League history\n<p>In the live ball era, only two National League teams have won 108 games — the Big Red Machine in 1975, and the Mets in 1986. But no National League team has won more than 108 games since the 1909 Pirates (110-52).</p>\n<p>To be the first NL team in 113 years with more than 108 wins, the Dodgers have to finish 10-9.</p>\n<p>These Dodgers also still at least technically have a chance to reach the major league record for wins in a season. The 1906 Cubs and 2001 Mariners each won 116 games for the most in MLB history. To match that, the Dodgers would have to finish 17-2. Don’t bet on it.</p>",

The trailer has received 1.5m dislikes on YouTube and caused a lot of bigots to have a conniption fit. If you’re getting a sense of deja vu about all this, it’s because the same people already had a meltdown in 2019, when the live-action remake was first announced.</p> Continue reading...",

        "link": "https://reason.com/2022/09/17/american-hunters-cry-fowl-over-canada-border-ban/",
        "description": "<p>Americans who hunt waterfowl in Canada were up in arms this month, caught off guard by a surprise U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) order that prohibited them from returning to the United States with their fresh kills. This week, though, facing strong criticism from hunters and outdoors advocates, the USDA reversed the ban. That was welcome news to hunters—especially those who'd traveled to Canada to hunt waterfowl when the season opened earlier this month.</p>\n<p>The import ban was intended to help stem an enormous, ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic bird flu in North America that's seen thousands of wild birds confirmed to be infected and millions of commercially raised chickens and turkeys culled after also becoming infected. To dent the outbreak, the USDA's Animal &amp; Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) issued a mandate to waterfowl hunters in June. It banned them from bringing live birds and raw meat into the United States from specified \"control zones\" in Canada and required hunters to cook any meat they intended to bring back across the border.</p>\n<p>\"The importation ban only pertains to birds that fly through or are killed within the boundaries of specified control zones,\" Outdoor Life reported in July. \"These are areas that have a high incidence of bird flu.\" The report also noted the mandate was confusing to hunters, who can't realistically \"know if those birds [they've killed] flew through a control zone.\"</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Field &amp; Stream reported that things got even more confusing when APHIS decided to ban hunters from bringing virtually any waterfowl they'd taken back into the United States. The ban's impact was immediate. Delta Waterfowl noted last week that the ban had \"functionally shut down all import of birds from all Canadian provinces.\" The Meat Eater reported the ban \"forc[ed] many American hunters to leave their meat north of the border.\"</p>\n<p>Critics hit back at APHIS over not just the ban but the agency's opacity and seeming duplicity in adopting it. After all, the APHIS ban came just days after the agency had assured hunters it would not issue such a ban. </p>\n<p>Ducks Unlimited, a leading waterfowl and wetland conservation group, blasted the timing of the APHIS announcement, issued late on a Friday that heralded the arrival of the Labor Day holiday weekend in the United States and the start of waterfowl hunting season in parts of Canada.</p>\n<p>\"This last-minute, after-hours, notice is a disturbing development,\" Ducks Unlimited said in a statement. \"Waterfowl hunting seasons in a number of Canadian provinces opened on September 1, meaning American citizens currently hunting north of the border may be unaware the ducks and geese they are taking won't be allowed back in the U.S.\"</p>\n<p>Outdoor Life also pointed out that other laws—including a Fish &amp; Wildlife Service requirement that a bird's wings must be attached to any bird brought into the country—may conflict directly with the APHIS mandate.</p>\n<p>Perhaps worst of all, though, is the fact the ban made little sense and left hunters, wildlife and outdoors advocates, and scientists alike \"scratching their heads.\" That's large because, according to experts, around 4 billion waterfowl migrate voluntarily between Canada and the United States every fall.</p>\n<p>Ergo, the birds which APHIS prohibited American hunters from bringing back to the United States \"are the same ducks, geese and sandhill cranes, of course, that will soon be flying south from Canada to any number of destinations in the U.S.,\" Grand Forks Herald outdoors editor Brad Dokken wrote last week.</p>\n<p>In short, bird flu neither knows nor cares how it transits a border. APHIS should know this.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, logic appears to have prevailed. Without admitting the agency's ban made no sense or explaining why it was reversing course, APHIS announced this past Monday that it was lifting the ban, effective immediately, after \"working with stakeholders and other federal agencies to provide options.\" The new APHIS requirements mean hunters who want to bring waterfowl they've killed back to the United States must clean the birds and place them in a sealed container in which they're chilled or frozen. Ducks Unlimited, Outdoor Life, and others hailed APHIS's course correction.</p>\n<p>Billions of waterfowl and other birds migrate between the United States, Canada, and Mexico yearly—with no regard for regulations or borders. The problem of migratory birds spreading bird flu in the United States is about as likely to be impacted in any meaningful way by hunters carrying some of those same birds into the country—rather than merely letting them fly in—as it would be by an APHIS rule prohibiting sick birds from migrating into the United States.</p>\n<p>The post American Hunters Cry Fowl Over Canada Border Ban appeared first on Reason.com.</p>",

        "description": "New iPhones are here! Three out of the four new iPhone models launched this week, as well two out of the three new Apple Watch models, plus we got the official release of iOS 16, so it was a very busy week in the Apple world.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also released the first beta of iOS 16.1 that will deliver some of the new features that didn't make the cut for the initial iOS 16 release, while Garmin made headlines for its response to the rugged Apple Watch Ultra that launches next week, so read on for details on these stories and more!\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Ultimate iOS 16 Walkthrough: Guides and How Tos for Every New Feature\r<br />\nApple this week released iOS 16 to the general public after several months of beta testing. The software update is compatible with the iPhone 8 and newer and has a long list of new features and changes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter updating to iOS 16, be sure to check out our comprehensive walkthrough of every new feature, complete with dozens of guides and how-tos. We also have an overview of which options and settings you should set up first once you upgrade.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 16 Now Available: Six New Features Worth Checking Out\r<br />\nIn addition to our detailed iOS 16 walkthrough, we've also singled out six new features worth checking out once you've updated your iPhone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOne of the headline features of iOS 16 is the ability to customize the Lock Screen with widgets, wallpapers with a depth effect, custom fonts, and more. Another useful feature introduced is the ability to edit or unsend iMessages for a short time after they are sent.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHands-On With the New iPhone 14 Pro\r<br />\nThe iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone Pro Max are here, and we've already gone hands-on with the Pro models to check out some of the new features with a special focus on the Dynamic Island that replaces the display notch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSelect media publications and YouTube channels have had a bit more time with the latest devices and have provided closer looks at them. Reviews found that the Dynamic Island shows promise, while one review was particularly impressed with 48-megapixel ProRAW photos shot with the iPhone 14 Pro's improved camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nReviews are also out for the standard iPhone 14 and the Apple Watch Series 8.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEverything New in the iOS 16.1 Beta\r<br />\nJust a few days after releasing iOS 16, Apple has already moved on to beta testing iOS 16.1, which contains a handful of new features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe've put together a list of everything new for the iPhone in the first beta of iOS 16.1, including Live Activities, Clean Energy Charging, support for Matter accessories in the Home app, and more. Apple said the update will be released later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nShould You Skip iPhone 14? Five Major iPhone 15 Rumors to Be Aware Of\r<br />\nAre you still considering whether to order an iPhone 14 or wait for the iPhone 15 next year? To help, we've put together a recap of five major features rumored for the iPhone 15 lineup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNotably, all iPhone 15 models are widely expected to feature a USB-C port instead of a Lightning connector. This would significantly benefit data transfer speeds when exporting files from an iPhone to a Mac or other device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGarmin Reacts to Apple Watch Ultra: 'We Measure Battery Life in Months. Not Hours.'\r<br />\nIt didn't take long for watch maker Garmin to respond to the all-new Apple Watch Ultra, which competes in the high-end smartwatch category.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a tweet late last week, Garmin said it measures battery life in \"months\" and \"not hours,\" which appears to be mocking the Apple Watch Ultra's advertised 36-hour battery life. By comparison, Garmin says its Enduro 2 smartwatch gets up to 46 days of battery life.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMacRumors Newsletter\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have top stories like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, subscribe to our newsletter!Tag: Top Stories<br />This article, \"Top Stories: iOS 16 Released, iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Launch, and More\" first appeared on MacRumors.com<br /><br />Discuss this article in our forums<br /><br />",

They took an early lead on a home run by Adley Rutschman, but once again the offense struggled as Jordan Lyles struggled for his second straight start. You can get all of the details of the 6-3 loss in Paul’s game recap. </p>\n<p>Game two of the series starts today at 3:07 with Kyle Bradish facing off against José Berríos. Bradish. It will be Bradish’s fifth start against the Blue Jays, which is ridiculous. As good as Bradish has been of late, it hasn’t really gone well in his starts about the Jays. He’ll need to change that if the Orioles want to have a chance today, because you know they won’t score many runs. </p>\n<p>In non-Orioles news, the Houston Astros clinched a postseason spot last night, the first American League team to do so. It was inevitable for awhile, but now it’s finally official: Trey Mancini is going to the playoffs! Trey was on the Orioles roster for the wild card game in 2016 but did not play. Hopefully he can make an impact this year. </p>\n<p>I never expected to root for the Astros, but if the Orioles cannot turn things around and capture a playoff spot, it’ll be Trey’s team all the way for me. </p>\n<p>Links</p>\n<p>Toronto uses longball to come from behind and take series opener (updated) - MASN Sports<br />Steve Melewski’s account of last night’s loss, complete with team quotes.</p>\n<p>Orioles Outright Alexander Wells - MLB Trade Rumors<br />Alexander Wells is still in the Orioles organization, but after his long injury he's been designated for assignment and no longer occupies a spot on the 40-man roster.</p>\n<p>Answers to your Orioles questions, Part 1 - BaltimoreBaseball.com<br />You have questions about the Orioles, Rich Dubroff has answers.

Born in 1954, Krenchicki appeared in 58 games with the Orioles from 1979-81. He also played for Cincinnati, Montreal, and Detroit in his eight season career. Krenchicki passed away in 2018 at the age of 64. </p>\n<p>On this day in 1970, the Orioles lost to Washington 2-0.

Then with two on and two out in the fifth, Orioles’ starter Jordan Lyles was a strike away from retiring Springer and getting out of a crucial jam. Instead, the Jays’ center fielder went deep, and Toronto wouldn’t trail again.</p>\n\n\n<p>RT when you see it   #NextLevel pic.twitter.com/b4Bv3XPYgS</p>— Toronto Blue Jays (@BlueJays) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Chapman added some insurance runs with his second home run of the game. Baltimore would get one run back on Gunnar Henderson’s second career home run in the ninth, but that came too little, too late.</p>\n\nTexas Rangers (63-81) 4, Tampa Bay Rays (80-64) 3\n\n<p>The Rays had their chance at a rally, but they ended up leaving the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth as the Rangers escaped.</p>\n<p>Tampa Bay had taken an early lead in the second, but Texas answered back with a four-run inning in the third, with RBI coming from Corey Seager and a Nathaniel Lowe home run, going deep against his former team.</p>\n\n\n<p>.@nathaniel_lowe just RAKES! pic.twitter.com/8qZVrfBnAu</p>— Texas Rangers (@Rangers) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The Rays would get a run back in the sixth, but they failed to convert several other chances. In total, Tampa Bay left 12 runners on base and went just 2-for-12 with runners in scoring position.</p>\n\nHouston Astros (95-50) 5, Oakland Athletics (52-93) 0\n\n<p>It was the Yordan Álvarez Show in Houston as the Astros’ slugger homered three times and doubled once as they shutout Oakland.</p>\n\n\n<p>HE'S A BAD, BAD MAN. pic.twitter.com/kSOGpihvcE</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Álvarez’s performance was impressive enough that it managed to completely overshadow Justin Verlander’s return. In his first start since August 28th, Verlander looked like he never missed a beat, throwing five no-hit innings before exiting the game. Houston’s bullpen couldn’t continue that on to put up a combined no-hitter, but they did continue to put up zeroes and keep the A’s off the board. </p>\nLos Angeles Angels (62-82) 8, Seattle Mariners (80-63) 7\n<p>Despite falling into 4-1 and 8-4 holes, the Mariners nearly clawed their way back, but they eventually fell one run short.</p>\n<p>Julio Rodríguez actually led off the game for Seattle with a home run, but the Angels immediately answered back with two runs in the bottom of the first. From there, LA kept building out their lead, thanks to two homers from Luis Rengifo and another from Mike Trout.</p>\n<p>However, the Mariners kept answering and went into the bottom of the ninth down just two runs. Carlos Santana got one of them back with a home run, but Seattle couldn’t keep the rally going after that.</p>\nOther Contenders\n\n\nCleveland Guardians (77-66) 4, Minnesota Twins (72-71): The Twins had been cruising along for most of the game, getting five shoutout innings from Bailey Ober, and a sixth from Michael Fulmer, as they opened up a 3-0 lead. However, Cleveland rallied with three runs in the seventh, and then took the lead on a wild pitch in the eighth, which ended up being enough for the win.\n\nDetroit Tigers (54-89) 3, Chicago White Sox (74-70) 2 (10 innings): After managing just three hits and no runs off Tigers’ starter Matt Manning, the White Sox managed to battle back and tie with two runs in the eighth inning. However, they forgot to finish the job against the less than stellar Tigers. After Chicago went down in order in top of the 10th, Detroit got the win on a walk-off sac fly from Victor Reyes in the bottom half of the inning.",

        "description": "<p>The Red Sox are going to select the contract of right-handed pitcher Frank German today, according to Christopher Smith of MassLive.com. He will take the roster spot of catcher Kevin Plawecki, whose designation for assignment was reported last night.</p>\n<p>German, 24, came over to the Red Sox from the Yankees in a January 2021 trade. The Yanks were looking to offload Adam Ottavino and the last year of his contract, including German in the deal as payment for Boston helping them out in that regard. The Yanks had selected him in the fourth round of the 2018 draft.</p>\n<p>Though German was mostly a starter in his first few years in the minors, he has worked exclusively in relief this season, with very encouraging results. Between Double-A and Triple-A, he’s thrown 49 2/3 innings on the year with a 2.72 ERA and excellent 32.5% strikeout rate. His 9.6% walk rate is a bit on the high side, but those are still very encouraging results. As noted in Smith’s report, German has an upper-90s fastball that he combines with a splitter and a slider. He’ll now get a chance to try out that repertoire at the big league level, making his MLB debut as soon as he gets into a game.</p>\n<p>For the Red Sox, they are 10 games back of a playoff spot with just over two weeks remaining in the season. With their hopes of a postseason appearance gone, they can use their remaining games to audition players for next season and beyond. Since Plawecki was headed for free agency, the club has decided to use his roster spot on a young hurler who could factor into their future bullpen mix.</p>",

        "title": "Can Civil War happen again?",
        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3647063-can-civil-war-happen-again/",
        "description": "<p>The argument over America’s future has turned white-hot, from President Biden’s call to defend democracy against “semi-fascist” segments of the Republican Party to ex-President Trump’s pledge to consider pardoning those who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, if reelected. Far-Right bravado about starting another civil war ignores both the horrors and the outcome of the first one. Politicians and pundits who fan these flames best take heed or take cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our recent article in The National Interest examines this unrest in the light of what caused the Civil War of 1861-1865. Strife escalated through three distinct stages before 11 slave states decided they had to leave the Union. The first stage lasted from the nation’s birth to 1850, during which two political economies emerged and diverged: one of them industrializing and the other depending on slave labor. The Constitution’s authors deferred the issue of slavery, believing it would become uneconomical and fade away. But the cotton gin and mechanized textile manufacturing led to swelling demand for Southern cotton, yielding fat profits for slave-owners. While abolitionism simmered in the North, a string of compromises, many at the hand of Henry Clay, held the nation together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second stage took place from 1850 to 1860. Four weak presidents and a pro-Southern Supreme Court accommodated slavery. The Fugitive Slave Act, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and the Supreme Court’s Dred Scott decision all favored the South, lifting its hopes that slavery could exist and expand within the Union. However, soaring cotton prices led to increasingly brutal treatment of enslaved field-hands, bringing abolitionist sentiment to a boil. Scattered sectoral violence occurred, culminating in John Brown’s raid on Harpers Ferry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third stage was brought about by the 1860 election of Republican Abraham Lincoln (with under 40 percent of the popular vote), who was committed to halting the spread of slavery to new states. Southerners knew that slavery could not survive without expanding and saw secession as their only option. They underestimated Lincoln’s resolve, and unimaginable violence ensued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first stage of today’s national divide began when automation and global trade caused underemployment and lagging income among predominantly white Rust Belt and rural Americans. So-called “elites,” mostly college-educated, were suspected of wanting to “replace” neglected whites with minorities. The 2016 election of celebrity Donald Trump began the second stage, during which polarization worsened but remained peaceful. Trump’s followers believed their interests were protected by the president and the conservative Supreme Court and saw no reason to rebel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The election of Biden and Trump’s refusal to admit defeat brought the United States to the brink of stage three in 2021. Thanks to some responsible Republicans, transition of power took place. Still, the greatest and least remediable danger remains the conviction of Trump’s cult-like base that he won the election, making the current government illegitimate in their eyes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The potential for large-scale violence exists today as it did in 1861. Americans possess nearly 400 million firearms, concentrated in the South, Midwest and West. A large fraction of Trump voters agree that “true patriots may have to resort to violence to save the USA.” Nearly 100 anti-establishment militias have been identified, the most virulent of which, Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, are standing by for a fight.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But 2022 is not 1861, when half the nation chose to leave, and the other half resisted with force. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s federal institutions — including courts, police, and the military — remain firmly subordinated to the Constitution. Serious talk of state secession remains rare. Red and Blue states are internally divided and less contiguous than were the North and South 1861, making full-blown continental-scale war unlikely. Those who would take up arms against the Constitutional order are markedly weaker than the forces available to protect it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, the situation is unquestionably alarming. Stage three and violence may need only a triggering event, akin to the 1860 election of Lincoln that precipitated secession. Perhaps, as Sen Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) warns, widespread rioting would follow an indictment of Trump. Or claims of another stolen election, in 2024 or even 2022, could ignite hostilities, possibly involving coordinated militia attacks on government property and personnel, or on minorities. While these would surely be put down, a forceful reaction by police, National Guard or, in the extreme, federal troops would scar the nation and leave it no less divided.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is to be done?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply stated, Republican leaders must squarely condemn all threats of political violence and distance themselves from colleagues who encourage or condone it — even at the cost of votes and elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where are these leaders? Where is today’s Henry Clay?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the moment to step forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first Civil War may have been unavoidable: A second one is not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hans Binnendijk is a Distinguished Fellow at the Atlantic Council.

        "description": "<p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said during a press conference Friday the transport of migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., is  “just the beginning” of efforts to relocate those crossing the border. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, DeSantis chartered two flights carrying migrants, the majority of which are believed to be from Venezuela, from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flights are similar to Abbott’s decision the past several months to bus migrants to Democratic-led cities such as Washington, D.C., and New York City. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Now we see, in New York and D.C., they used to beat their chests when Trump was in office, saying they are sanctuary jurisdictions. Then the minute Texas starts bussing there they get very bent out of shape about it,” DeSantis said. “These are just the beginning efforts. We got an infrastructure in place now. There is going to be a lot more that’s happening.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis says these efforts are helping “put this issue on the front burner,” adding that Florida is using $12 million allocated to the transporting of migrants for individuals who are in Texas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The governor said Florida also claimed migrants are trying to get to Florida. Florida itself is home to a large Hispanic population. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So they’ve been in Texas, identifying people that are trying to come to Florida, and then offering them free transportation to sanctuary jurisdictions,” DeSantis said, adding there will be more buses and flights for migrants in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis also addressed allegations that the migrants have been lied to about where they were going, saying they all signed forms and were given packets with a map of Massachusetts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reports have surfaced that migrants at Martha’s Vineyard thought they were going to Boston and are now struggling to attend their immigration court date in Texas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democrats have seethed over the moves and decried them as inhumane. The White House compared the transporting of migrants to human trafficking.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These were children, they were moms, they were fleeing communism,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. “And what did Gov. DeSantis and Gov. Abbott do to them? They used them as political pawns, treated them like cattle in a cruel, premeditated political stunt.”</p>",

But after this year’s hamstring strain and last year’s shoulder surgery, keeping Ríos in Triple-A gave him his most regular playing time in the last three seasons.</p>\n<p>Ríos hasn’t been lighting it up with Oklahoma City, hitting .262/.345/.477 with seven home runs, 11 doubles, and a 31-percent strikeout rate in 39 games, but he does have three multi-hit games in his last five.</p>\nTriple-A Oklahoma City\n<p>Oklahoma City hit multi-run homers in each of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth innings to win a road slugfest over the Albuquerque Isotopes (Rockies).</p>\n<p>After Ríos in the fifth, Devin Mann hit a two-run shot, Jake Amaya slammed a three-run shot, and Ryan Noda added a two-run home run for insurance.</p>\n<p>It’s a three-team race in the Pacific Coast League East Division, with the other two teams playing each other this week. El Paso (Padres) beat Round Rock (Rangers) on Friday to maintain a one-game lead over Oklahoma City, with 11 games left to play.</p>\n<p>El Paso 78-61 (.561)<br />Oklahoma City 77-62 (.554)<br />Round Rock 75-64 (.540)</p>\n<p>Conveniently, Oklahoma City plays six games at El Paso beginning Tuesday, the last full week remaining on the schedule.</p>\nDouble-A Tulsa\n<p>Two runs in the 10th inning off Guillermo Zuniga handed the Drillers a home loss to the Springfield Cardinals.</p>\n<p>Brandon Lewis homered, doubled, and drove in three runs for Tulsa in defeat.</p>\n<p>Springfield stole three bases off Tulsa on Friday, giving the Drillers a whopping 238 stolen bases allowed on the season, and at an 86.9-percent success rate. The 238 steals allowed are more than any other Double-A or Triple-A team.</p>\nHigh-A Great Lakes\n<p>The Loons were eliminated from the Midwest League playoffs with a 6-5 loss to Lake County Captains (Guardians) in Game 3. The road team won all three games of the series.</p>\nTransactions\n<p>Triple-A: Heath Hembree, who was designated for assignment on Tuesday, cleared waivers and was sent outright to Oklahoma City, but the 33-year-old right-hander elected free agency.</p>\nFriday scores\n\n\nOklahoma City 12, Albuquerque 9 \n\nSpringfield 7, Tulsa 5 (10 innings) \n\nLake County 6, Great Lakes 5 (Loons lose series, 2 games to 1) \n\nSaturday schedule\n\n11:05 a.m. PT: Oklahoma City (Robbie Erlin) at Albuquerque (Logan Allen)\n5:05 p.m.: Tulsa (TBA) vs. Springfield (Edgar Escobar)\n\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p></p>\n<p>If you are into web3, the biggest news of the week in tech was not the massive Figma-Adobe deal. No, the leading story of the last few days — arguably even the last few weeks — has been the Ethereum Merge.</p>\n<p>The Merge, an upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain that moved it from a proof of work (PoW) to a proof of stake (PoS) system of consensus was a long-awaited shift that finally took place this week. And as the change in technology is expected to reduce the carbon footprint of the popular blockchain by ~99%, we had lots to get into.</p>\n\n<p>Now that the Ethereum Merge is behind us, what’s next?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But we didn’t just want to riff on the startup angle, or the web3 perspective, because the Merge had huge implications for crypto as an industry and its place in the world of emerging tech. That’s why we got together our startup and blockchain podcast teams for a collab episode to hit both angles: Anita and Jacquie from Chain Reaction, and Natasha and Alex from Equity. This also gave us a 50-50 TechCrunch-TechCrunch+ split, which was good fun.</p>\n<p>We started by setting the scene with how the anticipation around this monumental event in web3 has affected token prices and dug into what factors had been fueling optimism. Then we broke down the mechanics behind why proof-of-stake is greener, but may be less decentralized than proof-of-work (though each us had different takes on whether that’s a fair assessment).</p>\n<p>Pulling off the Merge was an event requiring such technical coordination and rigor that it’s been compared to the moon landing. Now that it’s happened, what will be the impacts on web3 startups? What about the rest of the tech industry, or large financial institutions, or Chinese crypto miners? We walked through all these questions and more, trying to address both what the Merge is and why it matters through as holistic a lens as possible.</p>\n<p>Just as there are tons of different stakeholders affected by the Merge, who all think differently, so do we. This episode had lots of back-and-forth as the team unpacked some quirky pieces of crypto jargon like the term “baker” and what it means in a proof-of-stake ecosystem as well as the timeline of what comes after the Merge, which includes the Surge, Verge, Purge and Splurge. No joke — we explain what those mean in this episode.</p>\n<p>We’ll do more of this sort of thing as time goes along, thanks to some welcome resource bumps to our production crew (huge shoutout to Grace, Theresa and Maggie).</p>\n<p>For more on the Merge, required reading can be found here, here, and here. Onward!</p>\n\n<p>Equity drops every Monday at 7 a.m. PDT and Wednesday and Friday at 6 a.m. PDT, so subscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Chain Reaction comes out every Tuesday and Thursday at 12:00 p.m. PDT, so be sure to subscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast and Spotify to keep up with the action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chain Reaction x Equity talk the Ethereum Merge by Anita Ramaswamy originally published on TechCrunch</p>",

        "description": "iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max owners should be aware that the iOS 16.1 beta is preventing the GPS from working properly on the devices for many users. Anyone who relies on location tracking should avoid the beta for now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBugs are common with beta software, but this issue affects a core function of the iPhone, prompting us to share this warning. iPhone 14 Pro users who already installed the iOS 16.1 beta will have to downgrade to iOS 16.0.1 or wait until a later iOS 16.1 beta fixes the issue in order to restore GPS functionality. A cause of the bug is unclear.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike the Apple Watch Ultra, iPhone 14 Pro models feature dual-frequency GPS support. This means the iPhones can receive signals from GPS satellites operating on both the legacy L1 frequency and the higher-power L5 frequency, which can better travel through obstacles like buildings and trees. A combination of the two signals should lead to improved location accuracy in mapping apps and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe standard iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus do not have dual-frequency GPS support.Related Roundups: iOS 16, iPadOS 16, iPhone 14 ProBuyer's Guide: iPhone 14 Pro (Buy Now)Related Forums: iOS 16, iPhone<br />This article, \"Warning: iOS 16.1 Beta Breaking GPS on iPhone 14 Pro Models\" first appeared on MacRumors.com<br /><br />Discuss this article in our forums<br /><br />",

        "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Right now it’s musical chairs in an auditorium with ample seats, no immediate urgency, as the real estate show we have been watching has been mediocre, at best. As I described previously, it was “The Great Pause”. We always have a summer lull; however, it was overwhelmingly magnified by everyone’s exhaustion brought on by the negative market dynamics including, but not limited to: the war in Ukraine, explosive inflation and the mixed messaging on how to manage it, the rapid rise in interest rates, the uncertainty of the coming mid-term elections* and more. Sentiment has been tepid, at best, as we come off 2021’s record deal volume; a phenomenon we are not likely to see again in our lifetime. But know this, John Walkup of UrbanDigs said it best, “we are crashing back down to NORMAL.” This is great news, as it means a more balanced market for every for everyone.</p>\n<p>  All charts: Courtesy UrbanDigs</p>\n<p>As you can see above the overall total pace of monthly contracts is indeed lower than the record volume we saw in 2021, but still substantially above pre-pandemic 2019. So even with all of the negative factors which we’ve endured, the market is healthy. However, if you glance at the most recent trend in the next chart below, you will see how the market is decelerating, a representation of a slower market and an opportunity to negotiate as we lead into the Fall season.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* The uncertainty that is always brought on by the mid-term elections and, even more so, by the Presidential elections is always much ado about nothing. I have been through innumerable market cycles in my 24 year career and they always amount to nothing except wasted time and opportunities. Deal volume becomes languid, as people fear what might happen. You know what happens?…nothing. Life moves on; people: have children, children leave the house, they get new jobs, get divorced, need to change neighborhoods etc. Had they not put their plans on hold and bought during the “uncertainty” (a difference of only a few months), they would have been far better off.</p>\n<p>My experience tells me you should “Buy Now, Sell Later.” What I exactly do I mean by this? The market dynamics now, for buyers, are far more favorable now than they will be in the Spring. The past months have revealed a weakening in the marketplace, which sellers cannot deny. The numbers will soon trickle in to reveal where actual value has settled and it will be measurably below where we were when entering 2022. The only closed prices we have been seeing are from deals that were struck 4-6 months ago when prices were higher; the lower valued closings are now beginning to filter through. The sellers who want to sell must capitulate to this reality; this is favorable for buyers. Yes, interest rates have gone up, but by relative historical standards, not absurdly so (look at the historical rate chart in this newsletter, below). You can always refinance (at a lower rate) later; but you can’t reprice later?</p>\n<p>Two things for buyers: 1) Typically your biggest barrier to purchase is the competition, not the price level. So while many will be sitting on their hands in uncertainty, identify your opportunity with fewer people in the room. Buy when others are not. 2) By Spring of 2023 (barring any unforeseen geopolitical event), I predict this marketplace is going to be on fire. This will be the moment when everyone has accepted the new realities and new normals of interest rates and inflation (both of which will likely have moderated). They will all then be willing to (and have to) move on with their life’s needs. It will be pent up demand. This is when the real estate show becomes really interesting and the game of musical chairs gets really tough. Remember what it felt like before assigned seating in a movie theater and you arrived late?…trying to find a seat? That’s the worst, nothing left…and that’s how it will feel. Every Manhattan lull is the precursor to a substantial run; we are in a similar moment right now.</p>\n<p>For sellers, this is where the “Sell Later” comes into play. If you can wait, sell in the late-winter/early-Spring when competition will be explosive and you will have far more people looking and competing for your property. If you don’t sell then….well, you are simply overpriced. Overpricing helps sell other people’s property. Manhattan is an extremely efficient marketplace, it is all about price. Prepare and plan in advance…do it now. If you want to properly bring your property on the market by the end of the Q1 2023. You will need that time and meticulously strategize the right presentation of your property to the marketplace. And price it right…get in and get out…that is how you will best succeed. When you establish a price, you are establishing an expectation; will your buyers be encouraged or discouraged by what they encounter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Please contact me to discuss anything and everything…inflation and interest rate expectations, inventory, pricing, timing, the rental market, preparedness etc.</p>\n<p>As you know, I always say two things: 1) Anyone interested in buying or selling, should be rolling up their sleeves to determine whether the time is right to sell or if there’s a home/investment property out there for them; and 2) Who represents you matters…your best investment is often in the broker you choose; find someone with experience, who you feel you can trust.</p>\n<p>ROBERTO CABRERA, CNE<br />\nLicensed Associate Real Estate Broker<br />\nBrown Harris Stevens Residential Sales, LLC<br />\n1926 Broadway, New York, NY 10023 <br />\nDirect:  917 – 906-0554<br />\nEmail: rcabrera@bhsusa.com</p>",

        "description": "Jordan Westburg, seen here with Bowie last year, had an amazing night last night. | Photo by 2021 Rodger Wood/Diamond Images via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The Orioles affiliates were all victorious on Friday, with Bowie gaining a game for its postseason berth.</p> Triple-A: Norfolk Tides 9, Charlotte (White Sox) 0\n<p>You know it’s a fun one when Grayson Rodriguez pitched five scoreless innings and that isn’t even the biggest story of the game. It is a great sign, though, that the 2018 first round pick, in his first outing back at Triple-A, plowed through five innings on 72 pitches, holding the Knights to just two hits and one walk. Might we see him in Baltimore before year’s end? I still hope.</p>\n<p>At the top for this game was shortstop and leadoff hitter Jordan Westburg, who Charlotte literally could not get out. He came to the plate five times and had five hits, including his Orioles minor league-leading 26th home run of the season. Westburg now has an .877 OPS as the Tides season winds down. 2021 first rounder Colton Cowser was 1-5 in the game.</p>\n<p>Beau Sulser pitched three scoreless innings and Nick Vespi finished off with a scoreless ninth. The three Norfolk pitches combined to allow only three hits in the game. With this victory, the Tides have crawled back above .500 for the season at 70-69. They’ve won five straight games and are 11-3 in the month of September.</p>\n<p>Box score.</p>\nDouble-A: Bowie Baysox 10, Akron (Guardians) 3\n<p>Ten runs on eight hits for the Baysox here, which is impressive efficiency. That’s because they capitalized on Akron pitchers not being able to throw strikes and drew a combined ten walks. Ten! This included three walks from designated hitter Donta’ Williams, playing his first game at Bowie. He also hit his first homer of the level.</p>\n<p>Second baseman Connor Norby, who’s been chasing his fellow infielder Westburg for the O’s minor league home run crown, had two hits including a dinger for his 25th home run of the season. Norby is OPSing .964 in his time with the Baysox this season.</p>\n<p>Picking up the win for the Baysox on the back of seven innings was Garrett Stallings, who struck out nine RubberDucks while allowing three runs on six hits.</p>\n<p>This was a crucial win for Bowie as they entered the day tied with Erie for the second half division title and a postseason spot. Erie holds the tiebreaker, so the Baysox really need to get ahead of the SeaWolves. They’ve got a game edge now, with two to play, thanks to Erie’s loss to Richmond on Friday. Just gotta keep winning.</p>\n<p>Box score.</p>\nHigh-A: Aberdeen IronBirds 5, Brooklyn (Mets) 4\n<p>This win for Aberdeen gives them the victory in their best-of-three playoff series, 2-1. They advance to the South Atlantic League championship, another best-of-three, which will be played against the Rays High-A affiliate, the Bowling Green Hot Rods, who beat Rome on Friday to advance themselves. Game 1 of that series is Sunday. Bowling Green, like Aberdeen, was a first half division title winner, though that squad was good in the second half too.</p>\n<p>The IronBirds were able to win thanks to a four-run fifth inning rally that put them on top for good. Heston Kjerstad hit a two-run double that broke the tie. Kjerstad also walked. Outfielder Dylan Beavers was on base twice as well thanks to a single and intentional walk. First baseman TT Bowens beat them all with two hits, two walks, and two runs driven in.</p>\n<p>For the IronBirds pitching staff, it was something of a patchwork game in the clincher. Five pitchers combined for the nine innings, including fresh AFL roster choice Nick Richmond’s two-thirds of an inning in relief of Ignacio Feliz, who faltered in his own third inning of relief.</p>\n<p>Box score.</p>\nSaturday’s Scheduled Games\n\nNorfolk: vs. Charlotte, 6:35. Starter: Bruce Zimmermann\nBowie: at Akron, 7:05. Starter: TBD",

        "description": "Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Elsewhere, nationwide fans are not as plugged into Aaron Judge’s home run chase as you might think</p> <p>Welcome to SB Nation Reacts, a survey of fans across Major League Baseball. Each week, we send out questions to the most plugged-in New York Yankees fans, and fans across the country. Sign up here to join Reacts.</p>\n<p>The Yankees may have played some uninspiring baseball for the majority of the second half, but they appear to be turning the ship around at the best possible moment, winners of their last four in a row and eight of their last ten. This successful stretch has helped them regain some cushion in the AL East standings, as has the Blue Jays and Rays essentially splitting their recent five-game series.</p>\n<p>New York currently owns a 5.5-game lead on the second-place Blue Jays, against whom they have gone 9-7 in the season series with three games still to play, and indeed Bombers fans are most worried about facing Toronto in the playoffs of the three likely AL Wild Card teams. Blue Jays starters Alek Manoah and Kevin Gausman have dominated the Yankees all season, George Springer appears to be the newest Yankee-killer in the AL East, and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette are hitting their stride in these final weeks.</p>\n  \n        \n      Kyle Thele\n  \n<p>Returning the focus to the Yankees roster, fans appear to be split on the most trustworthy arm in the New York bullpen. After leading baseball through the first half, the Yankee relief corps has faltered a bit in the second half thanks to a combination of injuries and ineffectiveness. </p>\n<p>Jonathan Loáisiga tops the list of most trusted Yankee relievers after turning his season around and regaining his dominant form from 2021 in recent weeks. Clay Holmes looked like the best closer in baseball before mechanical issues made him borderline unplayable for a stretch, so it’s relieving to see him back on track in the latest handful of outings. Wandy Peralta might be one of the most underrated relievers in New York if not in MLB, routinely getting the job done when called upon. Ron Marinaccio came out of nowhere to break into the inner circle of trust, though a recent injury and likely related struggles have caused his stock to fall a touch among Yankee fans. Finally, deadline day acquisition Lou Trivino has failed to win over many Yankee fans given his propensity to allow inherited runners to score. </p>\n  \n        \n      Kyle Thele\n  \n<p>Finally, we have arrived at the portion of our program dedicated to Aaron Judge’s thrilling case of the AL home run record. The presumptive AL MVP sits at 57 home runs entering play Friday, putting him four away from tying Roger Maris’ record of 61 set in 1961. As impressive as his season has been, not many fans believe he has what it takes, either this season or in the future, to reach the 70 home run plateau. Only two players in history have done it — Barry Bonds with 73 in 2001 and Mark McGwire with 70 in 1998 — and as we’ll see below fans have mixed feelings about these two marks. </p>\n<p>[all polls below were nationwide and not directed at exclusively Yankees fans]</p>\n  \n        \n      Kyle Thele\n  \n<p>Speaking of the AL home run record, there are a majority of fans who believe Maris’ mark is even more significant than that. That’s right, more baseball fans than not recognize 61 as the legitimate MLB home run record, discarding the mark of 73 set by Bonds due to their feelings about his use of PEDs. I guess that would make Judge the all-time home run king should he pass Maris in the coming days. </p>\n  \n        \n      Kyle Thele\n  \n<p>In perhaps the most shocking result of this series of polls, less than half of MLB fans polled nationwide responded that they were following Judge’s home run chase. Whether borne out of anti-Yankee sentiment or the result of general ennui surrounding the sport of baseball, that 51 percent of fans are willfully missing out on a historic pursuit that may not be replicated for decades borders on upsetting. </p>\n  \n        \n      Kyle Thele\n  \n<p>So there you have it, a rather surprising set of poll results covering a range of topics from potential playoff opponents, the state of the Yankees bullpen, and Judge’s home run race. Fans seem to be more fearful of the firepower in the Blue Jays’ lineup and pitching staff than the Rays’ track record of success against the Yankees in the playoffs. Conversely, it’s reassuring to regain trust in multiple members of the bullpen. And finally, fans across the sport are surprisingly down on Judge’s historic feats. I guess he’ll just have to hit 74 to show them. </p>\n<p>To vote in the Reacts surveys and have your voice heard each week, sign up here.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The red-hot Cubs win their fourth straight</p> <p>As fans, we often render psychoanalysis of the players we are watching. No doubt sometimes we are dead on and others we are way off base. I think there has been a general perception that Marcus Stroman has been over amped at home this season. If you followed his social media in the months after he signed with the Cubs, it was plain to see that he was excited to be a Cub and pitch at Wrigley Field. </p>\n<p>Is that what has caused his struggles at home this year? Who knows? The Cubs and Stroman aren’t going to give us that kind of insight. Regardless the reason, 2022 for Marcus has been plagued by two things. One, just not enough starts where he was fully healthy and the other is his performance at Wrigley Field. If we are reaching for excuses, it’s not hard to imagine column one impacting column two. </p>\n<p>One of the things I will always love about a pitcher like Stroman is that he wasn’t one reaching for a lot of excuses. He’d be the first to tell you that he needed to be better and he’d be one working on it both during starts and between starts. I’ve been disappointed to watch him struggle, but I’ve never worried that we’d see him succeed. He’s too good a pitcher to be kept down if his body is physically healthy. </p>\n<p>Here at the end of 2022, Marcus has strung together some strong starts and now he’s added one at Wrigley Field. Hopefully, any demons that popped up over the course of this season have been exercised and he’ll be ready to answer the bell on opening day in 2023. It’s soon to know such things, but I suspect he’s going to be handed the ball for the opener next year.</p>\n<p>Marcus is the no brainer for my top star of this game. Seven innings, three hits, two walks and a single run on a solo homer. He also hit two batters. He picks up a well deserved win for his efforts. </p>\n<p>My second star is an easy one too. Zach McKinstry continued his odd production. He rarely has a game with only one hit. If he gets a hit, it usually winds up a multi-hit game. In this one, he had a homer and a triple. He scored both runs for the Cubs. The .205/.264/.393 line is still unsightly, but there is definitely progress. If I pull back to August 24, he’s got a line of .250/.291/.558 (wRC+ 130) in 56 plate appearances. I have serious questions about the repeatability of that line, but certainly if it was, that line plays. </p>\n<p>For my third star, I give the nod to Manuel Rodriguez. He pitched a perfect ninth inning on the way to his second save of the season. He recorded one strikeout. The question on Rodriguez will always be the same one. He’s walked five hitters in eight innings of work on the season.

Nor would I know how to go about getting a squad. According to Dr Marisa G Franco, psychologist, friendship expert and author of Platonic, making friends as an adult is more complicated than when we were kids. “Children in school have what sociologists consider the essential ingredients for friendship to happen organically, which is repeated unplanned interaction and shared vulnerability. As adults, we don’t really have environments with those elements, because at work we’re maybe more guarded and less vulnerable, even if we see each other every day.”</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Adobe’s acquisition of Figma is a big deal in the world of creative apps. | Illustration by Kristen Radtke / The Verge\n    \n\n  <p>Over the past several years, Figma has built its name as a forward-thinking and collaborative design platform and a formidable competitor to Adobe, the giant in the creative apps market. That rivalry ended on Thursday when Adobe announced that it has struck a $20 billion deal to acquire Figma.</p>\n<p>The acquisition will allow Adobe to incorporate Figma’s popular design tools into its widely-used portfolio of creative apps. But the acquisition also means that Adobe will once again be taking a major competitor off the market and bringing it under its own umbrella, to the dismay of many designers who rely on the tool and are wary of another critical platform joining the company’s Creative Cloud service.

        "description": "<p>Moves by Govs. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), Gregg Abbott (R-Texas) and Doug Ducey (R-Ariz.) to transport undocumented migrants to sanctuary cities beyond their states have produced a torrent of denunciation and claims of racism as being (in the words of one writer) the work of \"white supremacists, relying on [a] racism-and-spite blueprint.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some pundits and Democratic politicians, such as Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.), have called for criminal investigations by the Justice Department on discrimination, fraud, “kidnapping or potential Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) charges.” DeSantis’ Democratic challenger in November, Charlie Crist, echoed calls for a federal investigation of his own state, declaring: “Justice needs to be served here.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these objections risk proving the intended political point of the trips, they do not prove a crime. If Attorney General Merrick Garland were to yield to this pressure, he would saw off the very branch of government on which his department sits.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Martha’s Vineyard previously declared itself a sanctuary for migrants, it declared a “humanitarian crisis” this week when some 50 individuals were flown there from Florida, and it denounced their arrival as a potentially criminal act. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other leaders, such as D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, have demanded the deployment of the National Guard when border states shipped migrants to their jurisdictions. In Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker did precisely that — called out the Guard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The border-state governors have responded that the groups bussed or flown to other jurisdictions are just a tiny percentage of those pouring over their borders, projected to be more than 2 million this year alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet Newsom’s demand that the Justice Department prosecute such transfers would create a dangerous precedent, one that might backfire on the Biden administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Biden administration has transported thousands of migrants across the country with little public notice, including late-night flights denounced by Republicans as clandestine “ghost flights.” Those transfers have been defended by Democrats and others as standard practice in the past three administrations. This, as thousands of migrants regularly overwhelm border towns despite administration officials — including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and, most recently, Vice President Kamala Harris — insisting the border is secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trips arranged by the three Republican governors have been denounced as a political stunt. And, indeed, they are — but they are not criminal acts, absent new evidence of compulsion or fraud. There are reports of some migrants demanding to be allowed off buses en route to New York, and some migrants are quoted as saying they were induced with promises of opportunities or care in sanctuary cities. Yet there is no evidence of systemic fraud or misrepresentation. Moreover, even if there was misrepresentation, it would not constitute some of the crimes being claimed on cable television, including Hillary Clinton declaring that it constitutes \"literally human trafficking.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most migrants do not intend to remain in border communities with a huge influx of migrants and limited opportunities — one reason why the Biden administration has moved migrants elsewhere. Thus, if the administration pursued Newsom’s allegation of a possible “civil rights conspiracy in violation of 42 U.S.C. section 1985,” it would potentially make a case against itself. If these governors are discriminating on the basis of national origin, so is the administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let's consider a few of the other alleged crimes suggested by politicians and pundits:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kidnapping, human trafficking</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The claim by Newsom and others that this could constitute kidnapping is absurd. Kidnapping requires that the culprit “unlawfully seizes, confines, inveigles, decoys, kidnaps, abducts, or carries away and holds for ransom or reward or otherwise any person.” There is nothing unlawful in conveying individuals who are lawfully in the country pending their immigration hearings; the trips are voluntary, and most migrants appear eager to accept free passage to cities like New York or Chicago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Human trafficking — a charge suggested by some law professors — is prosecuted by the Justice Department when you exploit “a person for labor, services, or commercial sex.” Gov. DeSantis may have overt political motives for transporting migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, but even cable-news programs have not suggested he is doing so for sexual or labor exploitation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Racketeering</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RICO was designed to combat organized crime by allowing criminal charges based on a pattern of underlying criminal acts. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961 there is a list of “predicate offenses,” and at least two of those crimes can create the needed pattern for prosecution. But there is no established RICO pattern here because there are no established predicate crimes. An effort by the Biden administration to designate political opponents as “racketeers” would raise deeply troubling concerns about weaponizing the criminal justice system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Illegal transport</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most-cited bases for criminal prosecution has been 8 U.S. Code § 1324, which prohibits transporting or attempting to transport undocumented migrants. The law is designed to combat smugglers, not states offering free trips to those released into the country by the federal government. It requires an act of “knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact” that the migrant “has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These trips, however, are not in violation of law or “in furtherance of such violation of law.” The Biden administration’s controversial “catch and release” policy means migrants are free to go anywhere or accept trips from public interest groups, the federal government or the states. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In theory, public interest groups arranging for transportation or individuals giving rides to migrants could be prosecuted on the same basis under Section 1324. In reality, if transporting undocumented migrants after they are released into the country is to be judged criminal, then the Biden administration would be the largest “coyote” in history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of this, of course, may prevent Attorney General Garland from using these wild accusations to launch a federal investigation. Biden officials are reportedly discussing options for legal action. Garland may yield to such demands. After all, he was criticized for creating a nationwide task force at the behest of school boards to investigate parents who publicly challenged board members over issues like teaching critical race theory or diversity policies. Such a move would magnify concerns about the Justice Department being used for political purposes before the midterm election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The governors’ critics are correct: These trips are politically motivated. That is precisely why the proper response is also political, not criminal. Using the criminal code to amplify political points is a dangerous precedent. Frustrating though it may be for sanctuary cities to face an influx of undocumented migrants, criminal irony still is not an offense under the federal code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University. Follow him on Twitter @JonathanTurley.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) released a set of policies Friday that roll back accommodations for transgender students in public schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Virginia Department of Education released updated \"model policies\" mapping out treatment of transgender students in schools from use of names and pronouns to participation in activities and sporting events separated by sex. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The document seeks to withdraw 2021 \"model policies\" set forth by former Gov. Ralph Northam's (D) administration. The Youngkin administration states that it reviewed the \"Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public Schools\" adopted in early March of 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The 2021 Model Policies promoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and social transformation in schools,\" the Youngkin administration wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The 2021 Model Policies also disregarded the rights of parents and ignored other legal and constitutional principles that significantly impact how schools educate students, including transgender students.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The document also addresses transgender students' use of bathrooms and defines a transgender student as \"a public school student whose parent has requested in writing, due to their child’s persistent and sincere belief that his or her gender differs from his or her sex, that their child be identified while at school.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Virginia Department of Education will now require students to be separated by their biological sex for \"for any school program, event, or activity, including extracurricular activities.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, overnight travel accommodations, locker rooms and \"other intimate spaces used for school-related activities\" shall be separated by sex. The policy notes that modifications will be made \"only to the extent required\" by federal law. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2021 guidelines released by Northam's administration allowed transgender students to participate in activities and use restrooms and locker rooms that corresponded with their gender identities, according to The Washington Post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2022 guidelines also require that schools keep parents informed about matters including \"their child’s health, and social and psychological development.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Youngkin won the governors' mansion in 2021 after running on the issues of parents' choice and the teaching of Critical Race Theory-related content, among others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new policies put forward by Youngkin's government come amid a nationwide push by GOP-controlled states to limit transgender students from participating in activities and sports teams that correspond with their gender identity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republican-led legislatures have also moved to restrict gender-affirming care like puberty blockers — which are reversible — to LGBT youth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Post, schools will be required to adopt these policies throughout the state after a 30-day comment period beginning on Sept. 26. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said he is “100% certain” Republicans will take the Senate in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I'm 100% certain we'll take the Senate,” said Scott, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), in an interview with Gray Television White House correspondent Jon Decker airing this weekend. “I think we’re going to have a breakthrough.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott premised his optimism on the quality of Republican Senate candidates, naming Wisconsin candidate Ron Johnson, Pennsylvania candidate Mehmet Oz, North Carolina candidate Ted Budd, Georgia candidate Herschel Walker and Nevada candidate Adam Laxalt, among others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Just look at our candidates. I mean, look at them … These guys have great backgrounds. And they're working hard. They're running good races,” Scott said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to Scott’s praise of the Republican candidates, Decker cited poll numbers that put their Democratic opponents in the lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The people that you've just praised so much, in many cases are trailing in their respective races,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Florida senator argued that President Biden’s low approval ratings in contested states give him confidence that the Republicans have a chance at winning, calling the president the “best advocate for why you do not want to vote for any Democrats right now.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is a referendum on Biden,” said Scott.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I do know that Biden helps us every day when he has a party for inflation in the day that inflation is 8.3%. That probably helps us a lot when he continues to leave the border open, that probably helps us a lot … If you look at everything he's doing when he says, ‘Oh, if you're a construction worker, you're going to pay off the debt of somebody going to an Ivy League school.’ That probably helps us win.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked about abortion, Scott said that he is pro-life but believes in “reasonable restrictions and exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Democrats have made abortion a significant issue, but they don't want to talk about their position on abortion. Their position on abortion is, and it's radical, they want to have abortion up to the moment a little baby’s born. They want to say a baby born alive, I can just sit on the side —” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decker disagreed with Scott, saying he does not believe that Democrats have expressed such extreme views.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“That's exactly how they voted,” Scott claimed in response. “They all voted for that. They all voted to say a little baby born alive they're just going to let starve to death over on the side.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The senator added that he thinks Democrats “have to talk about abortion” because in his view they are doing badly on other issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They can't talk about inflation. They can't talk about job growth. We lost 242,000 full-time jobs last month,” he said. According to data released by the Labor Department earlier this month, the U.S. added 315,000 jobs in August while the unemployment rate rose  slightly to 3.7 percent, compared to 3.5 percent the previous month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott continued: “I mean, they can't talk about the economy, they can't talk about schools, they can't talk about Afghanistan, they can't talk about the border, they can't talk about crime because it's all bad issues for them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott's comments come as polls have shown Democrats in a strong position to retain control of the Senate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month, amid polling that showed Trump-backed GOP Senate candidates including Oz and Walker trailing their opponents, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters that Republicans likely have a better chance of flipping the House than they do the upper chamber, citing \"candidate quality.\" Following those remarks, Scott acknowledged earlier this month that he and McConnell have \"a strategic disagreement\" over GOP efforts to win back the Senate in November, saying, \"We have great candidates.\"</p>",

        "description": "<p>Today marks the 235th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution. It is a time for a celebration of that remarkably durable framework for our democracy, and for sober reflection on the current challenges to it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Framers’ extraordinary achievement was the codification of a system of checks and balances to prevent abuse of authority and guarantee the rule of law — that fundamental principle of fairness, that no one is above the law, and that the law applies equally to all. That system has been the envy of the world, but it should not be taken for granted, and there are growing signs that it is under stress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index, (I am the executive director of the World Justice Project) rule of law in the United States has deteriorated by 6 percent over the past five years. The nation ranked just 27th out of 139 countries evaluated in 2021, and next month we will learn the latest ranking with the publication of the 2022 Rule of Law Index. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The index is widely recognized as the leading measure of the rule of law worldwide and is used by the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation to inform investment, aid and diplomacy abroad. Perhaps it is time to turn our gaze inward and scrutinize what these data tell us about the health of our own democracy as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rule of Law Index measures country performance across eight factors: constraints on government powers, guarantees against corruption, open government, fundamental rights, order and security, regulatory enforcement, civil justice and criminal justice. Over the past five years, the U.S. rule of law performance has eroded most precipitously (16 percent) in the index factor measuring constraints on government powers. This factor measures the checks on executive authority, for example from the legislature, the judiciary, independent audit agencies, the media and civil society. On the index measure of whether government officials are sanctioned for misconduct, the United States ranks just 33rd globally, and its score for whether the civil justice system is free from improper government influence puts it at a pitiful 41st out of 139 countries — just ahead of Latvia and below Namibia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The index scores are calculated based on surveys of both legal practitioners and ordinary people in each country, gauging how they experience and perceive their government’s performance. These surveys indicate that Americans’ confidence in the current effectiveness of our system of checks and balances is eroding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between 2016 and 2021, we saw a 30 percent decline in the U.S. general population’s expectations that a high-ranking government official taking public money for personal benefit would be held accountable. During the same period, we saw a 27 percent decline in legal practitioners’ responses about the likelihood that a powerful or politically connected person will face legal consequences for a nonviolent crime. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, these data drive home that a growing number of Americans do not believe that the rule of law holds or that no one is above the law. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The erosion of Americans’ trust in the rule of law requires urgent attention and principled leadership at all levels and in all branches of government, to advance and accept reforms that will reinforce accountability for all, even — indeed, especially — when such reforms run contrary to leaders’ personal interests. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means strengthening legislative and judicial ethics, including for the Supreme Court. It means abandoning partisan gerrymandering that permits representatives to pick their voters rather than the other way around. It means reinforcing the independence and authority of inspectors general to root out corruption and improper influence in government. And it means accountability for those responsible for the Jan. 6 insurrection, election deniers and others who seek to undermine the integrity of our electoral system, the ultimate check on authority. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only with such steps can the United States hope to reverse the steady erosion in its rule of law and honor the vision for accountable governance that the framers had two centuries ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elizabeth Andersen is the executive director of the World Justice Project.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3647624-ryan-rolls-out-ad-mocking-vance-ahead-of-trump-rally-osu-game/",
        "description": "<p>Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Tim Ryan’s (D-Oh.) campaign rolled out a new football-themed digital ad on Saturday mocking Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance ahead of his rally with former President Trump, which is set to take place during Ohio State University’s game against the University of Toledo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ad, which is a part of a six-figure ad buy on Facebook and Instagram, shows what it refers to as “Silicon Valley J.D.” going up against “Politician J.D.” in an effort to paint the Republican candidate as out of touch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 30-second digital spot comes ahead of the college football game and Trump’s rally with Vance in Youngstown, which are both set to take place at 7 p.m. on Saturday evening. Ryan and Ohio Democrats have been hitting Vance and Trump for holding the rally during the game. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Dude just doesn’t get it,” Ryan tweeted earlier this month along with screenshots of the timing of both events. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Football games, particularly Ohio State games, are a mainstay in the Buckeye State. According to the Columbus Dispatch, a record-breaking 10.5 million tuned into Ohio State’s game against the University of Notre Dame earlier this month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But while Saturday’s game may stand to get more viewership than Trump’s rally for Vance and down-ballot Ohio Republicans, the rally still stands to further boost Vance ahead of Election Day. Trump won the Buckeye State twice by eight points in 2016 and 2020. Earlier this year he endorsed Vance in the state’s GOP Senate primary, helping propel him to victory in the intraparty contest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rally is set to take place in Youngstown, which is a part of Ryan’s own district, but still has a sizable number of Trump supporters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Tim Ryan is a radical progressive who votes with Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi 100% of the time. He called the criminal justice system the ‘new Jim Crow,’ falsely smeared cops of murdering Ahmaud Arbery, and voted to end qualified immunity for local police. The only person who ‘doesn't get it’ is Tim Ryan,” Vance said in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polls show a tight race between Vance and Ryan, with the Republican holding a slight lead. A  survey from Emerson College and The Hill released on Friday showed Vance leading Ryan 44 percent to 40 percent. Thirteen percent of voters said they were undecided, while 3 percent said they planned to vote for someone else. Meanwhile, a USA Today/Suffolk University poll released earlier this week showed Ryan leading Vance 46.6 percent to 45.6 percent. The Real Clear Politics polling average shows Vance leading by 2.7 points and the non-partisan Cook Political Report rates the race as “lean Republican.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>— Updated at 10:21 p.m.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Buck Davidson/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Jenista’s two home runs were not enough to avoid a sweep on the farm</p> <p>It was an unfortunate Friday night on the Atlanta Braves farm system with all three affiliates taking losses. Rome saw its season come to an end at the hands of Bowling Green, who crushed them in game three of that playoff series to send the Braves packing. Greyson Jenista had by far the top performance of the day with two home runs in a Gwinnett loss. </p>\n(65-72) Gwinnett Stripers 5, (77-62) Durham Bulls 8\n<p>Box Score</p>\n\nGreyson Jenista, RF: 3-4, 2 HR, 3 RBI, .209/.276/.387\nRyan Casteel, C: 1-4, .209/.298/.488\nJoe Dunand, 3B 1-4, ,216/.309/.341\nMike Soroka, SP: 5 IP, 6 H, 6 R, 6 ER, 1 BB, 6 K, 6.43 ERA\nJacob Webb, RP: 1.2 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K, 5.55 ERA\n\n<p>Greyson Jenista had a huge day at the plate for the Stripers but he couldn’t carry them to a win. Jenista got the Stripers on the board in the second inning with a solo home run, one which tied the game 1-1. Unfortunately struggles from starter Mike Soroka put Gwinnett in a big hole in the next inning and they trailed 6-1. Jenista cranked a second home run in the fourth inning, this time a two run blast, and Gwinnett spent most of the game in striking distance. Outside of those home runs the offense struggled to get any momentum working and didn’t have any baserunners through the middle innings into the eighth. With one out in the eighth the Stripers had their big opportunity in the game when Durham walked four consecutive Stripers and forced in a run on a wild pitch. With the tying run on first base Ryan Casteel strolled to the plate with an opportunity to get Gwinnett back in the action but grounded into a double play to end the last real comeback chance. Gwinnett notched two base hits in the ninth inning and Jenista scored on a ground ball to bring them a run closer, but they would not bring the tying run up to bat in the inning. </p>\n<p>The home run bug plagued Mike Soroka in his start for Gwinnett, with the three he allowed accounting for five of the six runs on his final line. Soroka was off to a tremendous start when he struck out the first three batters he faced in the game but quickly saw that crash down when he gave up a leadoff home run in the second inning. He again allowed a leadoff home run in the third inning, then with one gave up a three run bomb that accounted for half of the runs he allowed. That final home run was the turning point in the outing, however, as Soroka would allow just one more hit while striking out three batters over his final 2 2⁄3 innings. The relief corp for Gwinnett avoided the long ball but didn’t keep the game tight and allowed runs to bleed through and put the game further out of reach. Jesus Cruz allowed a run over 1 1⁄3 innings before being replaced by Jacob Webb. Webb pitched the best outing of the day with 1 2⁄3 scoreless innings before Tyler Ferguson took his place and allowed a run in the top of the ninth inning.  </p>\n<p>Next Game: 9/17 vs (77-62) Durham Bulls @ 6:05 PM ET</p>\n<p></p>\n(61-73) Mississippi Braves 1, (69-60) Montgomery Biscuits 4\n<p>Box Score</p>\n\nCody Milligan, 2B: 1-3, 2B, BB, .275/.351/.328\nRiley Delgado, 3B: 1-3, .272/.341/.330\nJustyn-Henry Malloy, LF: 0-3, BB, .276/.404/.432\nAlan Rangel, SP:  5.2 IP, 3 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 3 BB, 6 K, 5.26 ERA\nJason Creasy, RP: 1 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K, 5.65 ERA\n\n<p>Alan Rangel put together a strong start for Mississippi, but a lack of offensive support doomed him and the Braves to a loss. Mississippi’s bats were quiet throughout the game, but especially struggled against Montgomery starter Joe LaSorsa who struck out five batters over three one-hit innings. After LaSorsa departed in the fourth inning the Braves got a bit of life with two walks and an error loading the bases in a scoreless game. The Braves could not come up with a big hit in the inning and didn’t record another hit until the eighth. Trailing 3-0 Cody Milligan gave Braves fans something to cheer with when he doubled with one out and came around to score on an error and a ground out, but Mississippi still couldn’t make much of a threat to come back. </p>\n<p>Alan Rangel gave up a single to the first batter he faced in the game, but that would not portend the results of the game for him. Rangel retired 11 of the next 12 batters he faced following that leadoff single with only a walk to break up his strong streak of play. Finally with two outs in the fourth inning the Biscuits got back in action with a double, but Rangel shut that down with a fly out and then pitched a scoreless fifth inning. Rangel got two quick outs in the sixth inning, but couldn’t quite get through it and had to be removed after a two out walk. This is where the lone run he allowed came from, as he was charged with a earned run and a loss after AJ Puckett gave up a triple on the first pitch he threw in relief. Puckett struggled to get the final out and allowed a run of his own before escaping that sixth inning. Puckett allowed another run in the seventh inning before mercifully we were treated to a different reliever. Jason Creasy pitched a scoreless eighth inning of relief and Kyle Wilcox allowed a run despite striking out three batters in the ninth inning.</p>\n<p>Next Game: 9/17 vs (69-60) Montgomery Biscuits @ 7:05 PM ET</p>\n<p></p>\n(1-2) Rome Braves 1, (2-1) Bowling Green Hot Rods 7\n<p>Box Score</p>\n\nBrandol Mezquita, LF: 1-3, HR\nGeraldo Quintero, DH: 0-2, 2 BB\nCal Conley, SS: 2-4\nBlake Burkhalter, SP: 2 IP, 4 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 2 BB, 1 K, 9.00 ERA\nGrant Holmes, RP: 1 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K, 3.00 ERA\n\n<p>Rome’s season has officially come to a close, as a poor performance in the final game of their series with Bowling Green ends their championship push. Offensively the Braves struggled across these three games and that carried over into last night as they only managed one run on six hits. That run came off of the bat of Brandol Mezquita, who made the most of his one hit this series by depositing a ball well into the night to cut the deficit in the game to 2-1. In the following inning Rome allowed four runs and the offense didn’t have much to fight back with. Bryson Horne doubled with a runner on in the fifth inning but Beau Philip was thrown out at home trying to score from first which snuffed out that scoring chance. Singles from Jacob Pearson and Cal Conley had the Braves in business with one out in the sixth inning, but consecutive strikeouts ended the last significant scoring opportunity the Braves got in the game. </p>\n\n\n<p>To The Moon   #StillHere pic.twitter.com/SU31NiaqRP</p>— Rome Braves (@TheRomeBraves) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The Rome offense was matched in futility by the Rome pitching staff, who allowed three home runs, seven walks, and seven runs over their eight innings of work. Despite the struggles they were perhaps a bit lucky to escape with only seven runs allowed with Bowling Green going 1-11 with runners in scoring position. Blake Burkhalter was called up from Augusta to make this start and it didn’t go so well for him. Burkhalter allowed two hits in the first inning before escaping on a failed double steal attempt, but had less luck and allowed a two run home run in the second inning. Alec Barger allowed two hits and two walks in the second inning, but the arm of Tyler Tolve once again kept Rome in the game as he picked off one of those runners to help keep the game scoreless. The game went completely off of the rails in the fourth inning starting with Trey Riley’s relief outing. Riley recorded two outs, but left the bases loaded on two hits and a walk for Jake McSteen. Two pitches into McSteen’s outing and the game was all but over, as a grand slam made it 6-1 in favor of Bowling Green. McSteen pitched a perfect fifth inning to finally give Rome a clean inning and the action slowed down thankfully with the only other run in the game coming on a solo home run off of Austin Smith. </p>",

        "description": "Photo by Donald Miralle/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>A few things happen to the body when you put it through stress, as happens during a sport or workout: there are muscle tears that will only begin to heal after you rehydrate and refuel. Most people use supplements such as whey and regular food to speed up the process, and lately, there has been a new addition: weed. If you are within a state that allows it, you want to try something like the Oreo strain with its calming effects that will allow your body to rest so you can recover since most muscle healing happens while you rest. If you are in a regulated sport, this option may not be available to you because marijuana is yet to be accepted at the level of competitive sport. </p>\nHow Weed Helps with Recovery\n<p>Injury and sports: these go together because most sporting activities are extremely physical, and anyone involved should expect to struggle with some form of injury at one time or the other. Sports people have learned to train and live with pain, but most throw in opioids and other painkillers to help them manage things. These can lead to addiction, hence the need to strike a balance.  </p>\n<p>As we always say in matters concerning marijuana, little is known since not much has been dedicated to its study. Even though more research would help, what is already known is the anti-inflammatory qualities of weed that get some work done to help muscles recover after extreme activity. Post-workout, most athletes complain of delayed onset muscle syndrome that presents in the form of soreness and pain, and some users say weed makes the pain more bearable as an analgesic. The calming effects are also great for making you relax and sleep soundly to speed up recovery that sore muscles direly need. </p>\n<p>The trials that have been going on bring both THC and CBD to the fore, where users use one of either or a combination of both. The main idea of these trials is to see whether weed helps with pain relief in specific areas and what doses work best if it does. Some users have noted that smaller doses of THC work well while larger ones accelerate the pain. This finding is already a good one because THC has psychoactive qualities that lead to a high that most users want to avoid, thanks to the anxiety and hallucinations some people report. </p>\n<p>Does weed give users an unfair advantage? Since it is not a steroid, it doesn’t, as it has only been seen to calm the mind, ease pain the same way medically-accepted drugs would, and maybe make the user introspective. These mental benefits will not give the user an unfair edge over a non-user, so it often makes no sense why sporting authorities disallow its use post-match. It lessens anxiety and makes the athlete focus on their sport, especially CBD, known to calm the mind. </p>\nWhy Marijuana is on the WADA Prohibited List\n<p>For any drug to be accepted for public use, it has to pass through the many bureaucratic routes laid out by the FDA, and botanical extracts are frowned upon because there isn’t enough studying in the area. Products on the World Anti-Doping Agency - WADA prohibited list have to meet three qualities:</p>\n\nPose a threat to athletes.\nGive them an unfair advantage.\nViolate the spirit of the sport.\n\n<p>The organization says athletes that use marijuana pose a threat to themselves and others due to the tendencies to take risks they may not if they weren’t under the influence, react slower in the field, and have poor execution of functions. As for the team spirit, the Feds and other entities in other parts of the world still regard weed as illicit, so it does not pose a good example to younger ones that may look up to said athletes as role models. The organization also says that reports from the field, interviews, and results from animal studies show that weed may enhance the performance of some players. </p>\n<p>The organization delisted cannabidiol in 2019, so athletes in various disciplines can use it in controlled doses. There is still so much work to be done to remove the stigma on the product, and hopefully, more tests in this area will shed some light.  </p>\nConclusion \n<p>The legalization of medical marijuana in 32 states and adult-use weed in 19 has led to its de-stigmatization to some extent. A lot is still to be done, but the few tests already starting on some athletes may shed more light on its use and effects on the body. When/if the Feds legalize it, we might finally start to see supplements with doses of THC and CBD that active athletes can use without the fear of being stopped for having an illegal substance in their bodies, but until then, they may have to look elsewhere.  </p>",

        "description": "@GoHammerheads/Twitter\n    \n\n  <p>Here’s how the season went for key Marlins prospects at the Low-A level.</p> <p>The next Miami Marlins affiliate we will get to in our 2022 season review is the Low-A Jupiter Hammerheads. The Low-A level was an interesting intersection between new draft picks, major leaguers on rehab assignments and some of the very best prospects in the organization. Also, many of the new rules coming to MLB in 2023 were in full effect for the Florida State League, including shift restrictions, the pitch clock and bigger bases. </p>\n\nJupiter Hammerheads (63-66)\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n<p></p>\nYiddi Cappe\n\n<p>One of my favorite prospects in the organization is the Cuban native, Yiddi Cappe. He began the season with the FCL Marlins playing on the backfields of Roger Dean Stadium. He was the best player on that team, which is why he earned the promotion to Jupiter. </p>\n<p>2022 Low-A Stats: .278/.299/.380/.679, 3 HR, 15 RBI</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>I believe that the key with Cappe has been consistency. He continued doing what he did in the FCL and at a pretty high rate. The main stat that jumps out was his low strikeout rate (13.2%), which was about twice as good as the overall Hammerheads strikeout rate.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear when Cappe will move up to the next level. There is no rush—he just turned 20 years old—and his hitting dropped off a lot late in the season. He should make it to High-A around the middle of 2023 if he stays healthy and consistent. </p>\nJacob Berry\n\n<p>The Marlins’ 2022 first-round pick had some ups and downs in his short stint with the Hammerheads. He showed flashes of being a solid hitter, hitting for pretty good contact and getting on base at a good rate. The doubt about Berry’s long-term impact is on the defensive side—he did not look comfortable at third base, which is the position that Miami drafted him to play. </p>\n<p>Expect Jacob Berry to be playing in Beloit in 2023. The Marlins said they believed he could develop into a big leaguer quickly and they will promote him aggressively based on his college track record. </p>\nIan Lewis\n<p>The Bahamas native was held back in extended spring training for the start of the 2022 season, but quickly made up for lost time. He slashed .349/.386/.476/.862 in May and stole 16 bases overall, tied for the highest total on the Hammerheads. Injuries limited him to 51 games.</p>\n<p>Lewis is a switch-hitter with huge splits (.309/.396/.446/.842, 2 HR, 19 RBI as LHB; .130/.184/.130, 0 HR, 2 RBI as RHB). In the future, he might have to consider focusing all his attention on hitting from the left side.</p>\n<p>Lewis is only 19. Like Cappe, he has a little more to prove before advancing to Beloit, but it wouldn’t be surprising if that promotion came early next year. </p>\nKahlil Watson\n  \n        \n      Sam Navarro-USA TODAY Sports\n  \n<p>The Marlins’ 2021 top draft pick had himself a rather messy first full season as a professional. </p>\n<p>Watson began the season on a tear, looking like one of the best offensive players in the Florida State League. However, his struggles to put his bat on the ball got worse and worse, and it seems he let that affect him mentally with how he behaved on the field and in the clubhouse. Several incidents led to Watson being removed from games and things reached a breaking point on July 1, when he disputed a check-swing call by pointing his bat towards the first base umpire as if he were shooting a gun. The Marlins suspended him internally and sent him away from the team. He returned to the Hammerheads on July 29 after a quick FCL rehab assignment. </p>\n<p>Watson was better after he returned (.258/.349/.452/.801 in 24 games) especially in terms of reducing his strikeouts, but he only hit one home run during that portion of the summer. He earned FSL Player of the Week honors for the final week of the 2022 season, ending on a high note.</p>\n<p>He will probably begin the 2023 season at the High-A level. </p>\nJoe Mack\n  \n        \n      Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports\n  \n\n<p>When healthy, Mack has been able to produce as expected offensively. Although he had almost a 30% K rate, he also showed a good eye at the plate and drew walks more often than any other Marlins prospect. That contributed to his super high .382 on-base percentage. It’s too soon to say for sure whether he has the defensive skill to remain at catcher for the rest of his career.</p>\n<p>The Marlins are sending Mack to the Arizona Fall League to get him extra reps. </p>\nTorin Montgomery\n<p>Torin Montgomery looks like a possible steal for the Marlins as their 14th-round draft pick. At the Low-A level, he hit 3 homers and 16 RBIs with a .336 OBP. </p>\n<p>Beyond the numbers, he has great raw power. Listed at 6’3” and 230 pounds, his body type reminds me of Avisaíl García’s body type. This is a big player who will hit you bombs. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Montgomery will most certainly be beginning next season at the High-A level. </p>\n<p>The majority of players from the 2022 Marlins draft class also made appearances for the Hammerheads from July-September, including Marcus Johnson, Jacob Miller, Karson Milbrandt and Josh White.</p>\n<p>Midseason promotions of note: José Salas, Zach Zubia, Osiris Johnson, Luis Palacios, Gabe Bierman and Kyler Castillo</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>Cleveland Guardians minor league recap for September 17, 2022</p> Columbus Clippers 7, Omaha Storm Chasers 8\n<p>Box Score · Clippers fall to 78-59</p>\n<p>There is no joy in Columbus today. Logan Porter destroyed the hopes and dreams of children across Central Ohio by blasting a solo home run in the top of the 9th inning to break a 7-7 tie. </p>\n<p>Nolan Jones, Gabriel Arias, and Georga Valera may as well have punched the mothers of said children directly in the face. How else would one characterize three strikeouts on ten total pitches in the bottom of the ninth? What do you want me to do, give a concise description of game action? </p>\n<p>The only hitless Clipper on the night, Valera still managed to contribute by driving in a run via sac-fly. </p>\n<p>Logan Allen allowed five runs in as many innings pitched, striking out seven with two walks. Luis Oviedo walked three but allowed no runs in two innings of work. Kevin Kelly uncharacteristically faltered and blew the save, while Ian Hamilton earned the loss.</p>\nAkron RubberDucks 3, Bowie Baysox 10\n\nBox Score · RubberDucks fall to 77-59\n\n<p>Despite tallying seven hits, three walks, and two stolen bases, the RubberDucks managed only three runs. Raynel Delgado DH’d and dazzled with two singles, an RBI, and a walk. Julian Escobedo started in center field and drove in two with a third-inning dinger. Johnathan Rodriguez tossed a triple onto the pile. </p>\n<p>Tanner Burns walked four and gave up three home runs. </p>\n<p>Composite relief pitcher and Bojack Horseman character Pintomarman Hickman-Ramirez pitched four and two-thirds innings. They allowed six runs with four earned and six walks. </p>\nLake County Captains 6, Great Lakes Loons 5\n\nBox Score · Captains win series 2-1\n\n<p>Birds flap in, think they can take on Lake County. Guess what, idiots? You can’t. Straight up can’t, and now look at you. Dead. The Captains now advance to the Championship Series of the Midwest League.</p>\n<p>Aaron Davenport earned the start and while he survived the encounter he did allow four runs in three and two-thirds innings. While an additional run scored it did so due to an error.  </p>\n<p>Alexfri Planez went 4-5 to lead the offense. All three runs he drove in came thanks to his first-inning home run. Yordys Valdez added two doubles.</p>\n<p>The Captains take on the South Bend Cubs starting TDB. TBD is set to face TBD at Four Winds Field. First pitch is TBD.</p>\nLynchburg Hillcats 3, Fredericksburg Nationals 0\n<p>Box Score · Hillcats win series 2-1</p>\n<p>Ryan Webb, Sergio Morillo, and Zach Pettway combined for a one-hit shutout of the Fredericksburg Nationals. The no-no persisted until the top of the eighth when Branden Boissiere singled off of Pettway. The win advances the Hillcats to the Championship Series of the Carolina League. </p>\n<p>Richard Paz scored Isaiah Greene in the second inning. Junior Sanquinton scampered home on a wild pitch in the fourth and drove in the final run in the fifth with a first-pitch single. </p>\n<p>The Hillcats take on the Charleston RiverDogs starting September 18th. TBD (very busy guy) is set to face Cole Wilcox. First pitch is 5:50 PM.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The biggest open secret in short-form video has nothing to do with the algorithm. The secret is that you can’t get rich on TikTok, because even the most viral creators earn a negligible portion of their income from the platform itself.</p>\n<p>TikTok remains hugely dominant over the copycat short form video feeds that competing social media giants have spun up in recent years, like Instagram Reels and Snapchat Spotlight. But, according to reports from The New York Times, YouTube Shorts is gearing up to announce an ad revenue-sharing model that could revolutionize short-form video and give TikTok a run for its money — literally.</p>\nRevenue sharing is in, Creator Funds are out\n<p>YouTube was arguably the first platform that made it possible for creative people to earn a living by posting interesting content on the internet. In 2007, only three years after YouTube was founded, the platform unveiled its Partner Program, offering creators 55% of the revenue earned from advertisements served before or during their videos.</p>\n<p>But TikTok pays creators through its Creator Fund, a pool of $200 million unveiled in summer 2020. At the time, TikTok said it planned to expand that pool to $1 billion in the U.S. over the next three years, and double that internationally.</p>\n<p>That might sound like a lot of money, but by comparison, YouTube paid creators over $30 billion in ad revenue over the last three years.</p>\n<p>A big reason why TikTok and other short-form video apps haven’t unveiled a similar revenue-sharing program yet is because it’s trickier to figure out how to fairly split ad revenue on an algorithmically-generated feed of short videos. You can’t embed an ad in the middle of a video — imagine watching a 30-second video with an 8-second ad in the middle — but if you place ads between two videos, who would get the revenue share? The creator whose video appeared directly before or after it? Or, would a creator whose video you watched earlier in the feed deserve a cut too, since their content encouraged you to keep scrolling?</p>\n<p>“We’re still in such early days on how we monetize this stuff, but I am an optimist, and I think that the industry will figure it out,” said Jim Louderback, former CEO of VidCon, in a conversation with TechCrunch this summer. “They’re gonna have to, because otherwise, creators are going to go where the money is.”</p>\n<p>But YouTube might just have figured it out. The company is reportedly set to announce a Partner Program-like ad revenue sharing model on Tuesday at its Made on YouTube event. If the rumors are true, YouTube Shorts creators would get 45% of ad revenue — a smaller cut than they do on YouTube videos, but a substantial upgrade compared to a paltry Creator Fund payout. As Louderback said, creators will follow the money.</p>\nThe problem with making money on TikTok\n<p>You can’t get rich on TikTok? What about Charli D’Amelio, who started posting dance videos out of her bedroom in high school and then made $17.5 million in 2021? But that money isn’t coming from TikTok itself. Rather, she and her sister Dixie D’Amelio got rich through massive brand deals, a reality show and venture capital investments. Even the YouTuber MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson), who out-earned every other creator by making $54 million last year, can’t seem to make good money on TikTok.</p>\n<p>That’s because TikTok’s Creator Fund model simply doesn’t work. The Creator Fund is a static pool of money that is divided each day among users in TikTok’s creator program based on how many views they get — but since the pool doesn’t grow, that means that as TikTok gets bigger, creators earn less money.</p>\n<p>Longtime internet creator Hank Green said in a video about the Creator Fund that he initially made about 5 cents per thousand views, but the number of creators in the program outpaced the growth of the program itself. So, over time, his payout decreased to about 2 cents per thousand views. At that rate, a highly impressive 10 million views per month would net you just $200, which isn’t exactly going to pay the rent.</p>\n<p>Of course, TikTok can be life-changing for creators who build an audience on the platform. Charli and Dixie D’Amelio may not make their millions from the TikTok app itself, but they wouldn’t have gotten the opportunity to work on their very own fashion line and reality show if not for their TikTok stardom.</p>\n<p>The father of these TikTok stars, Marc D’Amelio is the CEO of the family’s ventures, like D’Amelio Brands.</p>\n<p>“I have read about how TikTok is working on an ad sharing model and that would be great for the creator economy,” Marc D’Amelio told TechCrunch via email. “TikTok has built an amazing platform and changed the lives of tens of thousands of creators by giving them a platform to share their creativity with the world. It would be an incredible next step if so many of these creators could turn their creativity into full-time jobs.”</p>\n<p>D’Amelio is referring to TikTok Pulse, a program unveiled in May that allows brands to pay to place their ads next to the top 4% of videos on the platform. For the first time, this let creators earn 50% of ad revenue generated through that specific program. For now, this program is only available to creators with over 100,000 followers who happen to also create the platform’s top 4% of videos. But YouTube Shorts’ potential ad revenue sharing program could further democratize access to this kind of earnings.</p>\n<p>“I think TikTok is great on awareness. Whether you’re a brand or a creator, it’s a great place for people to become aware of you,” said Louderback. “But when it comes to conversion, whether you’re a brand that wants to sell a product, or a creator that wants to sell a Patreon [subscription] or merch, YouTube in many ways can be a better platform.”</p>\n<p>When creators build their audience on TikTok, the platform doesn’t remain their bread and butter for long.</p>\n<p>“I will say I don’t rely on it anymore,” Tyler Gaca (ghosthoney) told TechCrunch in June. “When [the Creator Fund] first came out and it was first established, I was in that period where I was creating seven videos a week, and it did help cover some of my bills.”</p>\n<p>But as Creator Fund payouts became less reliable, Gaca turned to podcasting and other writing projects for more sustainable income.</p>\n<p>“The Creator Fund doesn’t really help as much anymore,” he said. “But that’s because I’m not as active, I think.”</p>\n<p>Some creators can successfully leverage their TikTok followings to sell products or join them on other, more lucrative platforms, but that’s no guarantee.</p>\n<p>“With my funk band Scary Pockets, we spun up a TikTok presence pretty quickly and got to 100,000 followers on TikTok within three to six months,” Patreon CEO and co-founder Jack Conte, who also plays in several bands, told TechCrunch. “We were pumped about it until we realized, wait, this actually doesn’t mean very much for us. Like, we can’t send these folks to Spotify. It’s hard to get them to buy merch or join a membership.”</p>\n<p>Conte thinks that this is because TikTok’s algorithm is so hard to understand.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes you post a video and it gets a million views, and sometimes you post a video and it gets 100 views,” Conte told TechCrunch. “That is the essence of that algorithmically-curated ecosystem. What that essentially does is it reduces a creator’s ability to build connections with their followers.”</p>\n<p>With these challenges, running a creator business can feel unsustainable — but with the amount of value creators generate for these platforms, it shouldn’t be that way.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me that every content creator friend that I’ve talked to, we all share this same fear that everything’s just gonna collapse under your feet one day,” Gaca told TechCrunch. “So I did find myself at the beginning [on TikTok] definitely overworking myself, like doing full, minute-long comedic skits with costume changes and background changes, seven days a week. It was great for building an audience, but then I had this huge crash and burn.”</p>\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: TechCrunch</p><p></p>\nThis is YouTube Shorts’ best opportunity to surpass TikTok\n<p>For the past few years, major social platforms’ attempts to keep up with TikTok’s exploding popularity have felt laughable.</p>\n<p>To lure creators to its platform, Instagram even offered to pay out huge bonuses for posting viral Reels — in November, one creator told TechCrunch that they had been offered $8,500 for 9.28 million Reels views on Instagram. But users still don’t seem to want a TikTok-like experience from Instagram. Instagram even had to walk back some TikTok-like changes to its app after users (including Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian) expressed such deep distaste for them. Instagram head Adam Mosseri said that Instagram lags behind YouTube and TikTok in metrics important to creator satisfaction, a recent report from The Information showed.</p>\n<p>Even though Instagram’s parent company Meta has poured a wealth of resources into building out Reels, internal documents leaked to the Wall Street Journal revealed that Instagram users are only spending a total of 17.6 million hours a day with the product. That’s less than ten percent of the time TikTok users spend on the platform, a cumulative 197.8 million hours a day.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, over 1.5 billion logged-in users watch YouTube Shorts each month, but the company hasn’t shared metrics about how engaged these users are. TikTok reached 1 billion monthly active users about a year ago.</p>\n<p>If it can pull off this ad revenue share model, YouTube Shorts now has a chance to prove itself as the best way for short-form video creators to make a living. Even better, we know that social apps love to copy each other. If YouTube Shorts’ new monetization structure can lure other platforms to figure out their own revenue-sharing models ASAP, then we’re in for yet another boom in the creator economy.</p>\n\n<p>Patreon CEO Jack Conte is fed up with Instagram and Facebook</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Maybe creator funds are bad</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>YouTube Shorts could steal TikTok’s thunder with a better deal for creators by Amanda Silberling originally published on TechCrunch</p>",

        "description": "<p>Pinch-runner Ernie Clement raced home from second base on a wild pitch in the eighth inning for the go-ahead run and the AL-Central leading Cleveland Guardians rallied for a 4-3 win over the Minnesota Twins on Friday night in the opener of a crucial five-game series.</p><p>Clement ran for Josh Naylor, who led off the eighth with a single and took second on Oscar Gonzalez’s single. Jhoan Duran’s 2-1 pitch to Andrés Giménez bounced in front of catcher Gary Sánchez and went back to the screen on the fly.</p><p>Sánchez couldn’t find the ball initially and Clement rounded third and slid headfirst into the home plate, beating Sánchez's throw.</p><p>Clement heeded Naylor's advice when manager Terry Francona sent him in to pinch-run.</p><p>“As I’m coming in, Naylor stopped me and said ‘Hey, be ready for a dirt ball,’” Clement said. “So obviously if there’s a dirt ball I’ve got to get my butt to third. I was just running until (third base coach Mike Sarbaugh) stopped me and he never did, so I just kept going.”</p><p>The crowd of 20,669 was on its feet and Clement was celebrated by his teammates when he got back to the dugout.</p><p>“That’s as cool as it gets,” he said. “It’s got that playoff atmosphere and the energy the crowd brought, it kept us in it because we were down early. Especially with this team, we’re never out of a game. Everybody on the bench knows that.”</p><p>Cleveland leads third-place Minnesota by five games and has clinched the season series with a 10-5 edge, giving the Guardians the tiebreaker. The teams play a day-night doubleheader Saturday followed by games Sunday and Monday.</p><p>Cleveland swept a three-game series at Target Field last weekend and has won six straight over the Twins. The Guardians also gained a game on the Chicago White Sox, who lost 3-2 to Detroit in 10 innings.</p><p>The Guardians are 32-15 in games decided in the seventh inning or later, which is both fun and nerve-wracking for Francona.</p><p>“I don’t think you’re ever too old to — I’m nervous as hell,” he said. “And I don’t mean that in a bad way. It was exciting. Guys work all winter and all spring and play all year and you have the right to play in a game that’s this exciting. That’s great. Embrace it.”</p><p>The loss was difficult for the Twins, who seemed to be in position to cut another game into Cleveland's lead.</p><p>“It’s very hard,\" manager Rocco Baldelli said. “That was a very tough ballgame to watch because we’re feeling good with a lot of things that we’re doing. We had some big swings, we made some plays, guys were pitching good. There was a lot going real well.”</p><p>Trevor Stephan (6-4) pitched a scoreless eighth while Emmanuel Clase gave up an infield hit in the ninth, but got Gilberto Celestino on a groundout for his 36th save.</p><p>Duran (2-4) allowed a run in the eighth.</p><p>Bailey Ober allowed one hit over five innings in his first start since June 1 and Jake Cave hit a two-run homer in the fourth as Minnesota took a 3-0 lead, but Cleveland rallied in the seventh.</p><p>Second baseman Nick Gordon’s throwing error on Giménez’s grounder started the seventh. Giménez took third on pinch-hitter Owen Miller’s single and scored on Myles Straw’s one-out single. Jose Miranda made a diving stop at first base on Steven Kwan’s grounder, but the runners moved up a base and scored on Amed Rosario’s single.</p><p>“We didn’t play perfectly clean baseball ... We needed to really play an incredibly, crisp solid all-around game to get where we needed to be,\" Baldelli said. \"It wasn’t crisp enough.”</p><p>Cleveland starter Triston McKenzie allowed three runs in seven innings.</p><p>Up next</p><p>The Twins will add LHP Louie Varland (0-0, 3.38 ERA) as the 29th man to start Saturday’s first game against Cleveland RHP Shane Bieber (10-8, 2.91 ERA). RHP Josh Winder (4-4, 3.83 ERA) will start the second game for Minnesota against LHP Konnor Pilkington (1-2, 4.30 ERA) who will be the Guardians’ 29th man.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Democratic Gov. Tim Walz on Friday rolled out a framework for fighting climate change that shows his proposed direction on the environment if he wins a second term, a sweeping plan that would slash carbon emissions and speed the switchover to electric vehicles.</p><p>Walz announced the package just a week before early voting starts. Control of the governor’s office and both houses of the divided Legislature are at stake in the election, and Walz has been battered by Republicans for tying Minnesota’s vehicle emissions standards to California’s tough rules. He said he unveiled his plan so close to the election only because it took a long time to complete, but also that campaign season is a good time to “foster conversations” about policy directions.</p><p>“This issue will transcend whoever's elected. This issue is not going away. It needs to be addressed,” Walz said.</p><p>“The urgency is here,\" he continued. \"We're moving forward on this. And I think it lets us set up a stark contrast.”</p><p>It was a change in direction for a campaign that has for weeks focused on Democrats energizing their base with warnings about threats from the GOP to abortion rights and Republican accusations of Democratic inaction on rising crime and inflation.</p><p>The 69-page plan details six broad goals: clean transportation; climate-smart natural and working lands; resilient communities; clean energy and efficient buildings; healthy lives and communities; and a clean economy. Each category contained long, detailed lists of proposals.</p><p>Katrina Kessler, commissioner of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, said the Walz administration can implement some of the proposals on its own, while others would require approval and funding from the next Legislature, and still others could be achieved through partnerships with local governments, businesses and farmers.</p><p>The plan includes a goal of increasing the share of electric cars on Minnesota roads to 20% by 2030 from the current 1%, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, and achieving a zero net carbon emissions goal by 2050.</p><p>Minnesota is one of 17 states that have tied their vehicle emission standards to California's tough rules rather than the looser federal regulations. Those states now face tough decisions about whether to follow California's new, strictest-in-the-nation initiative to ban the sale of new gas-powered vehicles starting in 2035 or revert to the federal standards.</p><p>Kessler told reporters that the Walz administration currently has no plans to adopt the California rules, which would require a lengthy new rulemaking process. But she didn't rule it out either, a commitment that Republican lawmakers and the Minnesota Automobile Dealers Association have been seeking.</p><p>\"This is too important and too pricey of an issue to let the Governor keep Minnesotans in the dark.” GOP state Rep. Chris Swedzinski of Ghent, said in a statement.</p><p>Kessler said the administration is focused instead on its existing plans for expanding availability of electric vehicles under the state's current “Clean Cars” rule and will decide on next steps later.</p><p>“It's premature to try to ask us what are you going to do in three days when we haven't decided what we're going to do tomorrow,” Kessler said.</p><p>Walz made the announcement at a research center for Ecolab, a Fortune 500 company that provides cleaning, sanitizing and water and energy management solutions.</p><p>GOP gubernatorial candidate Scott Jensen criticized the governor's plan for not once mentioning nuclear power as a potential source of low-carbon electricity.</p><p>“However, Governor Walz’s report does mention the words ‘equity’ or ‘equitable’ 40 times,\" Jensen said in a statement \"While equality is something we should all strive for, it’s clear that this is a political document meant to shore up his base before an election, rather than a serious solution for Minnesota’s energy problems.”</p><p>Jensen has proposed a slate of ideas to reduce energy costs, including scrapping the governor’s Clean Cars plan.</p><p>“It is really important for Minnesota to have a governor who understands the threat that climate change presents to Minnesota, for this generation and future generations,” said Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park. She added that Walz's plan will build on the climate change provisions of President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.</p><p>“Climate has always been on the forefront of what Democrats are fighting for,” Senate Minority Leader Melisa López Franzen, of Edina, said.</p>",

        "description": "Painting and photograph by Robert Beck.\n<p>Painter Robert Beck has to put up with the same UWS construction as the rest of us, but he sees it a little differently. (Yes, he’s still looking for an UWS studio.)</p>\n<p>By Robert Beck</p>\n<p>The fact that a subject is unusual often is what gets me jazzed about painting it. I find night construction with the extremes of light and indefinite forms very attractive. Not just as a still image, but also as a fun event to watch unfold. Elements appear and move through pools of light, shadows, and silhouettes. You pick things out of the darkness. The sounds, sights, and smells are condensed. A few yards, rather than blocks. A moment rather than a schedule. That’s what makes an encounter, and encounters are what I paint.</p>\n<p>I was returning to New York, and my wife sent me a photo saying, “Here’s what you are coming in to.” It was a phone picture she took that afternoon of the utility guys digging, pounding, and making a lot of noise out front. Later in the evening, the workers and equipment went away, leaving lights trained on the open excavation. The next day they returned and filled in the hole. I had a great view from the window.</p>\n<p>My interest in painting an industrial nocturne had been whetted, and I kept my eyes out for some night construction to paint from life, but I couldn’t find the right place at a time when I was free and the forecast wasn’t awful. Other prospective subjects were piling up, so I decided to do this one in the studio.</p>\n<p>I first did a monochromatic study in raw umber (dark brown) on the panel, referring to Doreen’s photo for the mechanics of it and translating the light using what I’ve learned from the many paintings I’ve done outside at night. The next day I added color. It sat on a shelf for a week; then I decided it needed the car in the upper right, which added something subtle but important to the swirl of the composition.</p>\n<p>It looked to me like a wound being treated. A glimpse into another world. It has that mystery, that wonder for what’s down there. Perhaps even more so in New York, where you know a lot is going on that you don’t get to see.</p>\n<p>You can contact Robert Beck at robertbeck.net.</p>",

        "description": "<p>3:15PM: The Angels have officially announced Soto’s selection, Fletcher’s placement on the 10-day IL, and Velazquez’s move to the 60-day injured list.</p>\n<p>11:45AM: The Angels are going to select the contract of infield prospect Livan Soto, reports Daniel Álvarez-Montes of El Extra Base. He will take the active roster spot of fellow infielder David Fletcher, who was already reported to be headed to the injured list. A corresponding move will be required to get Soto onto the 40-man roster, though it will likely be Andrew Velazquez getting transferred to the 60-day IL. Velazquez recently underwent knee surgery that is going to keep him out of action well beyond the end of the schedule.</p>\n<p>Soto, 22, was originally signed as an amateur by Atlanta but was one of several prospects later released when an MLB investigation found that the club violated various international signing rules. Soto played for Atlanta’s rookie ball in 2017 team but signed on with the Angels prior to the 2018 season.</p>\n<p>Soto was featured in Baseball America’s list of top 30 Angel farmhands in 2018 and has been there ever since, currently occupying the #19 slot. Their report on him notes that he is regarded as a strong defender who doesn’t provide much with the bat, though Soto seems to have taken a step forward in that department this season. In 119 Double-A games this year, he’s walked in 13.1% of his plate appearances while striking out in 18.8% of them. His batting line of .281/.379/.362 amounts to a wRC+ of 104, or 4% above league average. That’s not an eye-popping result, but getting above-average production from a glove-first prospect is an encouraging development. Soto’s also added value on the basepaths, swiping 18 bags on the season.</p>\n<p>The Angels have used a motley crew of veteran role players up the middle this year, with the injury bug eating into that group recently by taking out both Fletcher and Velazquez. With the Halos well out of contention and just over two weeks remaining in the season, they can give a bit of playing time to Soto down the stretch and see how he fares. He’s mostly played shortstop this season in the minors, but with a bit of time at second base and third base mixed in. While Fletcher is out of action, Soto will join an infield mix that includes Luis Rengifo, Matt Duffy and Michael Stefanic.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Cardinals announced some roster moves prior to today’s doubleheader, with right-hander Dakota Hudson coming up as the “29th man.” Additionally, outfielders Dylan Carlson and Tyler O’Neill are swapping places, with Carlson coming off the IL and O’Neill heading onto it due to a left hamstring strain.</p>\n<p>The injury to O’Neill is a bit ominous it was a left hamstring strain that sent him to the IL for about a month earlier this year. An injury of similar severity would keep him out of action until mid-October, but O’Neill seems optimistic that won’t be the case. John Denton of MLB.com relays word from the outfielder that it’s a Grade 1 strain, which is the lesser kind. Perhaps O’Neill can avoid a lengthy absence, though he will miss at least the next ten days. With just over two weeks remaining on the schedule, anything beyond a minimum stint will make it difficult to return during the regular season.</p>\n<p>Of course, the Cardinals are a virtual lock to play in the playoffs, since they are 7.5 games ahead of the Brewers in the NL Central. A deep postseason run would give O’Neill more time to return to the field and get back into a groove, though the Cards will likely have to play the first round of the playoffs. This year, the top two division winners get a bye past the Wild Card round, but the Cardinals are well back of the Dodgers and 5.5 games behind the East-leading Mets.</p>\n<p>O’Neill’s campaign got off to a rough start, though he righted the ship a bit recently. Before going on the IL in June, he was hitting just .241/.292/.361, but has hit a much better .214/.323/.423 since returning. The combined batting line amounts to a 100 wRC+, exactly league average, though O’Neill has accrued 1.2 wins above replacement thanks to his baserunning and defense, in the eyes of FanGraphs. With O’Neill out, Carlson will step into the outfield mix and try to keep the club from missing a beat. He has also spent some time on the IL this year, going on the shelf once due to a hamstring strain and then a thumb sprain. He’s hitting just a hair above league average overall, as his .240/.316/.386 batting line amounts to a wRC+ of 101. Thanks to strong work in center field, he’s produced 2.3 fWAR in 112 games. He will likely get regular work up the middle, flanked by Corey Dickerson and Lars Nootbaar.</p>",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/twins-make-several-roster-moves.html",
        "description": "<p>The Twins have announced a series of roster moves, with outfielder Max Kepler going on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to September 14, with a right wrist sprain. Fellow outfielder Matt Wallner has been selected to the club’s roster. To create space on the 40-man, right-hander Drew Strotman has been designated for assignment. Additionally, Louie Varland has been recalled to serve as the “29th man” for today’s doubleheader.</p>\n<p>Kepler’s trip to the IL, his second of the year, will add to a very frustrating pile of injuries for the Twins this year. Kepler joins eight other position players who are currently on the shelf, in addition to eight pitchers, giving them a total of 17 players currently on the IL. The Twins spent months atop the AL Central division standings but have seen these mounting injuries drag them down to five games back of the Guardians, with the White Sox in between.</p>\n<p>Kepler’s had a bit of a down year but will surely still be missed by the club. His batting line of .227/.318/.348 amounts to a 95 wRC+, or 5% below league average, but he’s still produced 2.0 wins above replacement in the eyes of FanGraphs due to his strong work in right field. Since the move is retroactive, Kepler can return in a week. However, with just over two weeks left on the schedule, there will be a narrow window for Kepler to work with.</p>\n<p>Wallner, 24, was selected 39th overall by the Twins in the 2019 draft, climbing his way up the minor league ladder since then. This year, he’s split his time between Double-A and Triple-A, getting into 128 games between the two. In that time, he’s hit 27 home runs and has slashed .277/.412/.541, 144 wRC+. He’s walked in an impressive 17% of his plate appearances but also struck out in 29.8% of them. He’s been in the back half of Baseball America’s top 30 Minnesota prospects for the past few years but jumped up to #8 on their most recent iteration, thanks to his strong season here in 2022. FanGraphs views him similarly, putting him in the #10 slot. Both reports compliment his tremendous power but raise concerns about the whiffs. He’ll try his hand at major league pitching, beginning by starting in today’s game.</p>\n<p>Strotman, 26, was drafted by the Rays but came over to the Twins in the Nelson Cruz deal last year. Though he was largely a starting pitcher in his first few professional seasons, he struggled enough after the trade that Minnesota tried moving him to the bullpen this year. Unfortunately, Strotman hasn’t taken to the switch so far, as he’s produced a 6.44 ERA in 50 1/3 Triple-A innings this season. That’s come with a strong 51.1% ground ball rate and 24.2% strikeout rate, but a dismal 13.8% walk rate. The control has been a nagging issue for Strotman, who’s posted double-digit walk rates in all of his recent stops.</p>\n<p>Despite those command issues, Strotman has some promising traits and can still be optioned for the remainder of this year and one more season. Teams searching for pitching depth could take him on as a project and try to improve that control. With the trade deadline passed, the Twins will have to put Strotman on waivers in the coming days.</p>",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/angels-to-place-david-fletcher-on-injured-list.html",
        "description": "<p>Angels interim manager Phil Nevin told reporters, including Jeff Fletcher of the Orange County Register, that infielder David Fletcher will be going on the 10-day injured list. The corresponding move is not yet known.</p>\n<p>Fletcher, 28, was hit on the hand by a pitch a week ago and has been clearly hurt since then. Despite a diminished swinging ability, he has continued taking the field but it seems the ailment will finally put him out of action for a spell. Sam Blum of The Athletic relays that scans on the hand came back negative, which is encouraging. Nevertheless, the club will keep him out of action for 10 days and hope to have him back for the final week of the season. The club is well out of contention, making it fairly logical to let him heal up and get some healthy at-bats before the winter arrives.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how things play out from here, it will surely go down as a frustrating campaign for the infielder. This will be his third trip to the IL on the season, having already twice landed on the shelf due to a hip strain. With all that missed time, he’s only been able to get into 54 games on the season so far, producing a .259/.296/.349 batting line that’s been 18% below league average by measure of wRC+.</p>\n<p>Fletcher has always provided strong defensive marks at multiple positions, which allows him to be a valuable player even if his bat is a bit below average. The shortened 2020 season is the only time he’s produced a wRC+ above 96, but he’s still produced 7.3 fWAR in 494 career games thanks to his glovework.</p>\n<p>Despite having two superstars in Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani on the same team, the Angels have still struggled for years due to subpar performances elsewhere on the roster. MLBTR’s Steve Adams recently took a look at how the starting pitching may be in a better position than it has been in quite some time. With 2023 being Ohtani’s last season before becoming a free agent, it could be argued that the middle infield is the biggest weakness for next year’s club.</p>\n<p>This year’s breakout of Luis Rengifo is an encouraging development in that department, but getting Fletcher healthy and productive could be another boost. In 2019, Fletcher played 154 games and produced a wRC+ of 96 but was still worth 3.1 fWAR thanks to his glovework at second base, third base, shortstop and the outfield corners. Rengifo can also play those positions but not as well, though he has hit .275/.305/.443 for a wRC+ of 110 this year. Anthony Rendon and Jared Walsh are expected to be on the corners, though each of those comes with question marks after injury-plagued seasons of their own. Rendon has missed most of this year due to a wrist injury that required surgery while Walsh underwent surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome a few weeks ago. Both are expected to be ready for Spring Training, and Rendon could even return this season, though there’s a great deal of uncertainty hanging over the club’s infield mix for a very crucial season.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Almost every week, we seem to learn about a new tentacle of the brazen attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, especially in Georgia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest surfaced in rural Coffee County. Surveillance video obtained by CNN shows a Republican county official escorting two Trump-connected operatives into the local election office on Jan. 7, 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On that same day, a voting system in the county was breached. As CNN notes, the operatives in the video have already acknowledged that they gained access to a voting machine at the behest of Sidney Powell, a former Trump lawyer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story unfolding in Coffee County only shines the spotlight brighter on Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, who is conducting a criminal investigation of interference in the 2020 election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The people of Georgia can be thankful that she’s on the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a former acting district attorney in neighboring DeKalb County and a former assistant U.S. attorney here in Georgia, we both understand that a prosecutor’s most basic responsibility is to follow the facts wherever they may lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, district attorneys in Georgia swear an oath to discharge their duties “without fear, favor, or affection.” Willis is doing exactly that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you may have seen in the news in recent weeks, there have been a number of challenges to grand jury subpoenas as the district attorney goes about her work. And there’s been a lot of overheated rhetoric about the investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R), for example, claimed Willis was trying to mess with his reelection campaign. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he’s “never been more worried about the law and politics as I am now.” A group of fake presidential electors even tried to have Willis thrown off the case because of supposed political bias.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But don’t be distracted. Willis is running a fair and methodical investigation. She’s ignoring the politics and pursuing accountability — just as the people of Georgia deserve. This investigation is a clear example of the power and importance of state and local leaders in our broader justice system and our democracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, the investigation is being conducted by a special grand jury. As a result, Willis had to get the approval of a court before the grand jury could even be seated. That should put to rest any thought of a political motive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Proceedings before special grand juries are generally secret, but we know a lot about this case from the public record, including motions and orders posted online by the Fulton County Superior Court clerk’s office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we know tells us a great deal about how seriously Willis takes her duty to pursue every thread.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know she’s looking into former President Trump’s infamous phone call to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger after the election, demanding that he “find” enough votes to reverse President Biden’s win in the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Willis is also looking into the plot to appoint a fake roster of pro-Trump electors, calls by Trump to Georgia’s governor and attorney general, and Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s trips to Atlanta to peddle lies in front of state lawmakers, and harassment of Georgia election workers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, there’s also the trail in Coffee County. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) reported last week that the special grand jury is “increasingly interested” in the security breach there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the AJC, the panel has already approved a subpoena for documents from an Atlanta tech services company in its communications with Powell and Lin Wood, two Trump-aligned lawyers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are not the steps of an impetuous prosecutor who’s out to score cheap political points. This is a thorough investigation — and it should be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tampering with a presidential election is high stakes. The people of Georgia, and the country, are entitled to a full uncovering of the facts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why judges have repeatedly brushed aside attempts by public officials, Trump-connected lawyers and other potential witnesses to avoid testifying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one of those attempts, 11 of the fake electors sought to disqualify Willis, arguing that she was playing politics. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who was appointed to supervise and help the special grand jury, easily dismantled that argument.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He wrote, “These electors have provided no evidence that the District Attorney (or any member of her staff) has done anything that suggests a possible political motivation for investigating them, beyond the banal observation that they are Republicans and she is not.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Particularly noteworthy was a footnote addressing their argument that Willis is targeting “only Republicans.” McBurney wrote that it eludes him how “an investigation into allegations of Republican interference in the 2020 general election in Georgia would have any other list of targets than Republicans.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let politicians and potential targets of the investigation make their predictable claims. Willis is doing her job with a quiet competence, and at risk to her own safety. She’s given us no reason to expect that will change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two weeks ago, she announced the indictments of 26 people accused of being part of a criminal gang carrying out rampant home invasions in the Atlanta area, some of them violent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have a message,” she said. “Get out of this county or expect to see all sentences that go life-plus.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hardly the words of a single-minded prosecutor distracted by an obsession with red and blue politics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t know where the election interference investigation will lead. Willis said recently that she has brought about 60 percent of the people she wants to have testify before the special grand jury. As many legal observers have pointed out, her investigation may ultimately ensnare Trump himself. No one is above the law, including former presidents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is a prosecutor who takes her work step by step, and that is several steps down the road. For now, we can all be confident that Willis is committed to following the facts, wherever they may lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She expects the special grand jury to finish its investigation by the end of the year, at which point she will turn over its report to McBurney. A special grand jury can’t indict anyone. Only a regular grand jury can do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, as Willis said just the other day, “We will continue to fight to make sure that the grand jury and the public gets the truth.” That’s just what a prosecutor should do, and the people of Georgia should expect nothing less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amy Lee Copeland is a former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Georgia and currently an attorney at Rouse + Copeland LLC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Javoyne Hicks is former acting district attorney for DeKalb County and currently a senior attorney at Lawrence &amp; Bundy LLC.</p>",

Trump aides turned over more documents to the Justice Department in June, after the department began investigating the issue at the request of the Archives. An FBI search of Mar-a-Lago in August recovered another 27 boxes of documents, including more classified materials. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump and the Justice Department remain locked in a legal battle over the documents, with a federal judge this week appointing Judge Raymond Dearie as special master to review materials seized from Mar-a-Lago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee who is presiding over the case, has blocked the Justice Department from accessing the classified documents until Dearie completes that review.

Its premise is familiar enough, not least to fans of Octavia Butler’s influential 1993 novel Parable of the Sower: an apocalyptic landscape brought on by ecological collapse, amid which a band of black American refugees seek salvation. In Jake Blount’s account, they are sustained by the spirituals and blues of yesteryear and their imprint of suffering and redemption.</p><p>Blount (pronounced Blunt) has cut a sleek path through the realm of Americana, first as a bluegrass fiddler and banjo player with assorted sidekicks, then with an acclaimed solo debut, 2020’s Spider Tales. He also totes credentials as a music historian. His knowledge is put to good use here, mixing obscurities – several captured by song collector Alan Lomax in the mid-20th century – with better known pieces such as Rosetta Tharpe’s Didn’t It Rain and Blind Willie McTell’s Just As Well Get Ready, You Got to Die. All are given striking, albeit minimalist acoustic settings (the apocalypse is electricity-free). Blount’s co-producer, Brian Slattery, adds percussion to fiddle, banjo and guitar, plus there is rap and massed gospel voices.

        "description": "<p>Washington Post: “After winning the Republican nomination in May, Vance spent months running what many in the party say they saw as an ineffective campaign that lacked urgency and has forced him and outside allies to scramble, in a state that former president Donald Trump carried twice and has trended red in recent years. Trump will campaign with Vance on Saturday night in Youngstown, as Vance seeks to jump-start a candidacy that polls show has left him in a competitive race.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Nonpartisan analysts still give Vance an edge, and Republican strategists voiced confidence that the state’s shift to the right will help Vance prevail in November. But some say they fear Vance wasted precious time, putting himself in an unnecessarily precarious position — one requiring a financial bailout that ate into resources that could have gone to GOP candidates in other states that will help determine control of the Senate next year.”</p>",

Not any old company, mind, but one big enough to figure in Standard and Poor’s index of the 500 largest. The answer is surprising: the seven-year rolling average stands at 19.9 years. Way back in 1965 it was 32 years and the projections are that the downward trend will continue.</p><p>Remember that we’re talking averages here. The trend doesn’t mean that no companies currently extant will get to their first century. Some almost certainly will, as some have in the past: AT&amp;T, for example, is 137 years old; General Electric is 130; Ford is 119; IBM is 111; and General Motors is 106.

Don’t,” Biden said in a televised interview with U.S. broadcaster CBS that is due to air on Sunday night. “It would change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden’s warning comes after a surprise counteroffensive by Kyiv put Russian forces in retreat in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. on Thursday announced it would send $600 million in military aid to Ukraine, with its contributions totaling $15.1 billion since the start of the war in February. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked how the U.S. would respond if Putin were to use chemical or tactical nuclear weapons, Biden said: “It’ll be consequential. They’ll become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been. And depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CBS released excerpts of the “60 Minutes” interview ahead of its scheduled broadcast on Sunday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

        "description": "John Sleezer/Kansas City Star/Tribune News Service via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>A recent article from The Athletic outlines a situation of very little hope for Kansas City’s near future.</p> <p>“At some point, they have to turn the corner.”</p>\n<p>Wait, pause, let’s just take a moment and appreciate that three former Royals beat writers got together, formed their own version of The Avengers, and exposed the Kansas City Royals with as devastating a news article ($) as you’re likely to read about a sports team that doesn’t involve tangible harm to others. Say what you will about the wins and losses, but Royals fans have been blessed for many years with terrific beat writers for the Kansas City Star, The Athletic, and the Royals’ own website. There may not be much value in watching the games, but there’s plenty in reading up about the team the day after, and that continues to be true with Lynn Worthy and Anne Rogers, even as the three who wrote this article have largely moved on from their jobs covering the Royals.</p>\n<p>Alright, that’s about it for the nice things I have to say today.</p>\n<p>“At some point, they have to turn the corner.”</p>\n<p>Those words are from the second-to-last quote from general manager J.J. Picollo in the linked piece written by a veritable all-star squad of former Royals beat writers for The Athletic earlier this week. It’s damning stuff on the surface, going into extreme detail about the many ways the Royals’ front office has failed while attempting to scout, draft, and develop pitchers over the past decade-plus. In case you had a flicker of hope remaining, the article does not paint the current system in a significantly better light than what has come before.</p>\n<p>Those words, though. Those words have stuck with me in the hours since I first read them. We’ve talked a lot about accountability around Royals Review this year because Dayton Moore brought up the concept when the team finally fired hitting coach Terry Bradshaw without seeming to truly understand what it means. Those words suggest to me that Dayton Moore not only didn’t grasp the meaning of the concept of accountability but that those under him aren’t overly concerned with it, either.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of underlying assumptions in that simple. nine-word sentence. Let’s break it down, shall we?</p>\n“At some point”\n<p>If you look up the definition of the phrase, you get, “A moment in time that is not specific.” The lack of specificity is a real problem for me, as I think it should be for all of us. If you do even cursory research into goal-setting, one of the core concepts that almost everyone agrees on is that goals should be specific. This makes sense on a basic level. The goal, “I want to climb Mount Everest at some point,” is not nearly as strong as the goal, “I want to climb Mount Everest by the end of 2030.” The lack of specificity makes it really easy to procrastinate and make other kinds of excuses. </p>\n<p>Let’s bring the example down a bit. If your boss asks for a progress report and you reply, “I’ll have that to you by the end of the day.” You’re probably in much better shape than if you reply, “I’ll get that to you eventually.” In the first example, you’re making yourself accountable to a specific outcome by a specific time - something your boss can rely upon. In the second example, you’re forcing your boss to set a deadline because you are not being accountable enough on your own.</p>\n<p>Does that mean there is no excuse and no mercy for occasional missed deadlines? Of course not. Sometimes things happen. Royals fans cut the team slack in 2016 when they lost Mike Moustakas for the entire season due to injury and again in 2017 when Yordano Ventura’s life was tragically cut short while many were counting on him to become the staff ace. And we aren’t exactly J.J. Picollo’s boss to demand the same level of accountability that our bosses might demand of us. However, by using this kind of indefinite language Picollo sets an expectation that he isn’t accountable to us at all or that he doesn’t actually have a clue when changes should be expected. One is worse than the other, but neither is particularly good.</p>\n“have to turn the corner”\n<p>The definition of the phrase “turn the corner” is, “Pass a critical point and begin to improve.” The thing about turning the corner is no situation or person ever has to do it. There is often a hope or a desire that they will, but no requirement. The fact of the matter is that the Royals pitching prospects may never turn any more corners. This might be as good as any of them ever get. Given a chance to expand on the idea that the pitching prospects must improve at some point, J.J. Picollo’s quote continues by simply doubling down on the idea.</p>\n<p>There’s only so long you can go. They have to turn the corner.</p>\n<p>OK. Thanks for the incredible insight Mr. Picollo! The corner must be turned. Why isn’t corner-turning happening? What will it look like when the corner is turned? What will it take to turn the corner? </p>\n<p>Who cares. Just turn the corner already!</p>\n“they”\n<p>This might be the most infuriating part of the whole thing.</p>\n<p>“they”</p>\n<p>Not “we.” Certainly not “I.”</p>\n<p>“they”</p>\n<p>J.J. Picollo - and by extension, the Royals’ front office - take no responsibility for what comes next with these pitchers. It’s entirely up to them. If they want the data, they have to go find it. If they want to improve, they need to figure out how and make it happen. The Royals’ front office will not be accountable to helping these pitchers improve. Either they will sink or they will swim. They will suddenly learn to throw more effective pitches in more effective spots or they will continue to walk batters and give up home runs.</p>\n<p>At least until their contracts mercifully end and they can go to a team that will actually take accountability for improving them.</p>\n<p>Jakob Junis has now pitched nearly an entire season for the San Francisco Giants. His numbers are no longer quite as eye-poppingly good as they were early in the season, but he’s still showing career bests in nearly every category on the FanGraphs dashboard. His 4.53 ERA as a starter would be third-best among the Royals. His 4.13 FIP as a starter would be second-best. And the Royals chose to non-tender him because they felt he wasn’t going to be able to figure it out. When asked about his early success, the Royals’ only defense was to claim they’d asked him to do the things that were helping him find success but that he hadn’t done it.</p>\n<p>The implication was that they were unable to convince him it was a good idea. Knowing what we now know after reading the article in The Athletic, it seems completely obvious that they wouldn’t be able to convince him because they don’t appear to properly prepare or share the available data with their pitchers. I think we also have to question whether even if he had been convinced the Royals likely would have been either unable or unwilling to help him figure out how to best accomplish those changes. The team was focused on Jakob Junis figuring out Jakob Junis’ stuff. In retrospect, it’s absolutely no wonder that, failing to find success with what the Royals were willing and able to offer him, Junis had to turn to learning pitches from his brother in an attempt to hang on to his big league job. </p>\n<p>Yes, we’ve talked a lot this year about accountability and the Royals. But that’s because, with every new nugget of information we learn, we discover a front office that has even less accountability than even the most pessimistic among us had previously assumed. But hey, at least there’s good news.</p>\n<p>At some point, they have to turn a corner.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Hunter Martin/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>And a couple other Cubs moves.</p> <p>Adbert Alzolay, whose 2022 season has been plagued by shoulder and lat injuries, will at last make his season debut for the Cubs, as he’s been activated by the team today. It’s been nearly a full calendar year since he last pitched in the major leagues, two innings against the Cardinals October 1, 2021.</p>\n<p>The Cubs, for reasons I cannot fathom, keep trying Alzolay as a starter. In his rehab assignment this season, he has made five starts (one with the Arizona Complex League Cubs, four for Triple-A Iowa). He’s peaked at 54 pitches in one outing and thrown more than 50 three other times.</p>\n<p>Gonna say this right here and now. Continuing to try to make Alzolay a starter is a mistake. He keeps getting hurt. Also, trying him as a long reliever/spot starter is also a mistake. He’d going to get hurt again if the Cubs do that.</p>\n<p>They should try him as a setup man the rest of the year and then as a closer in 2023. He’s clearly got the stuff for it — he could probably tick up a couple miles per hour as a closer — and throwing one inning three times a week is, in my view, the best way to keep Alzolay healthy and productive.</p>\n<p>Per this Tribune article, the team does plan on using him out of the pen:</p>\n\n<p>“It’s a luxury to try to match him up out of the pen,” Ross said. “He’s had a whole year to rehab and develop. I’ve been reading all the reports and he said he feels as great as he has in a long time.</p>\n<p>“I know he’s constantly trying to evolve. We’re an organization that tries to make guys better. So I’m just going to let him get up here and show us what he can do without a whole lot of expectations.”</p>\n\n<p>But then the article goes on to say he might be used as a multi-inning reliever as Keegan Thompson was earlier this year.</p>\n<p>Here’s what I think: Alzolay turns 28 in March, he’s no longer young, so 2023 is his time to finally establish himself as a MLB pitcher. It should be as a closer.</p>\n<p>To make room for Alzolay on the 28-man and 40-man rosters, Frank Schwindel and Sean Newcomb were designated for assignment. </p>\n<p>Here are today’s other roster moves:</p>\n\n\n<p>Cubs moves:<br /><br />• RHP Adbert Alzolay activated from IL<br />• INF Esteban Quiroz (acquired from Rays for Harold Ramírez in spring) selected from @IowaCubs <br />• OF Seiya Suzuki to MLB’s paternity list<br />• LHP Sean Newcomb, 1B Frank Schwindel DFA’d</p>— Jordan Bastian (@MLBastian) September 17, 2022",

        "description": "<p>The Cubs are making a batch of roster moves prior to today’s game, per reporter Mark Gonzales. Right-hander Adbert Alzolay has been reinstated from the 60-day injured list while infielder Esteban Quiroz has had his contract selected. In corresponding moves, outfielder Seiya Suzuki was placed on the paternity list while left-hander Sean Newcomb and first baseman Frank Schwindel were designated for assignment.</p>\n<p>Quiroz, 30, has taken an unusual path to the big leagues as he was playing in the Mexican League for years, not signing with an affiliated club until he was nearing his 26th birthday. He’s spent time in the minor league systems of the Red Sox, Padres and Rays, before coming to the Cubs as part of the Harold Ramirez trade in March. He’s only been healthy enough to get into 40 Triple-A games this season, hitting .212/.358/.322 in that time for a wRC+ of 89. However, he’s been much better since returning from the injured list at the start of August, hitting .299/.450/.442 in that time. He’s played second base and third base this year, though has also played some shortstop in previous season and some outfield work back in Mexico.</p>\n<p>With the Cubs well out of contention and just over two weeks remaining on this year’s schedule, they can use those games to audition players for future roles on the team. Quiroz will jump into an infield mix that also includes Zach McKinstry, Christopher Morel, Patrick Wisdom, Alfonso Rivas, David Bote and Nico Hoerner, though Hoerner might not be a factor for a while. He’s missed time recently with an injury and an MRI just revealed a moderate right triceps strain, per Gonzales. “It was a little worse off than we thought,” manager David Ross told Gonzales.</p>\n<p>Schwindel, 30, got a nice stretch of play last year after the Cubs traded away many of their regular at the deadline. He made the most of that opportunity, hitting 14 home runs in 64 games, slashing an incredible .326/.371/.591 for a 154 wRC+. He couldn’t keep the fairy tale alive this year, however, as he’s hit just .229/.277/.358 for a wRC+ of 76. With the trade deadline passed, he’ll be placed on waivers in the coming days to see if any other team believes there’s more magic left in Frank the Tank.</p>\n<p>Newcomb, 29, once seemed like a rotation stalwart in Atlanta but has fallen on hard times recently. He was bumped to bullpen work and eventually designated for assignment earlier this year, getting traded to the Cubs. The change of scenery hasn’t helped much as Newcomb has a ghastly 8.78 ERA in 27 2/3 innings this year, walking 14.2% of batters faced in the process. This is the second time the Cubs have designated him this year, with the previous instance resulting in Newcomb clearing waivers and accepting an outright assignment. Based on his unfortunate results this year, he’ll likely pass through waivers unclaimed again. With minor league seasons winding down, it’s possible he could accept another outright and make a couple of appearances in the minors, though it’s also possible he just decides to get an early start on free agency.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Job one for any politician is to get elected. Job two: Get reelected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For decades now, one tried-and-true method for accomplishing that goal is to make the voters fear something, blame someone, and despise the other political party. This campaign strategy is rarely about how the candidate will help people; it’s about how the “other candidate” would take what they have and ruin their lives.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democrats and Republicans alike excel at this basically foolproof strategy and, because they do, working-class Americans are dealing with a “misery index” that’s going through the roof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One well-connected and influential person seems to have had enough of “the other side is evil” contrivance. Speaking recently to an audience at the National Conservatism Conference in Florida, billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel addressed this negative trend. He admonished Republicans who have been barking out what the Democrats are doing wrong — as opposed to outlining what the GOP would do right — saying, “The temptation on our side is always going to be that all we have to do is say, ‘We’re not California.’ It’s so easy, so ridiculous to denounce, but … should we maybe have more of a positive agenda? … We’re leaning way too far into pure nihilistic negation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have two quick thoughts on that: The first is that Thiel is 100 percent correct. The second is, even though he said “our side,” implying that he is a committed Republican, I suspect he is more for the “Pragmatic Party” than anything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But therein lies the crux of the problem for Thiel and others hoping for … well, hope. Neither party cares much for what’s pragmatic. Offering up commonsense solutions doesn’t make you fear something or hate someone, and, in the minds of many politicians, no fear and no hate equals no vote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going back to working-class Americans, the people who represent the foundation of our nation, no one has paid a higher price than they because of the hardships brought about by the pandemic, government-ordered lockdowns, anarchy in city streets, supply shortages, high fuel prices, crumbling infrastructure, escalating inflation, rising crime, and a dysfunctional political class in Washington and many state capitals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If anyone needs a sliver of sunshine, it is the American people. Can Thiel help to uncover that beam of positivity? Maybe not, but he could jumpstart a healthy discussion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As evidence, consider the reaction of Larry Kudlow, former director of the National Economic Council in the Trump administration and former associate director in the Office of Management and Budget under President Reagan, who is now a Fox News financial host. “GOP tech guru Peter Thiel is undoubtedly right that Republicans should have a more positive agenda based on broad-based economic growth that benefits all Americans,” Kudlow said. “Sen. [Rick] Scott is right to develop his 12-point plan. [Former House Speaker] Newt Gingrich is also right that the GOP should focus on key issues, rather than the 2024 presidential election.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m glad Kudlow emphasized those things, especially the plan offered by Scott (R-Fla.), which is a blasphemy of traditional values that has been getting lit up by President Biden, Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and practically every far-left site in the country. Because it has attracted such criticism, some conservatives are beginning to think, “With enemies like that, maybe Scott is on to something.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, maybe he is. But, like Thiel, Scott is trying to take on a special-interest machine with tentacles that reach back decades. Legendary filmmaker Frank Capra brought it to light more than 80 years ago with his award-winning film, “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” Anyone hoping to introduce a “positive agenda” in politics — including politicians who actually may be doing what’s in the best interests of their constituents — should watch that Jimmy Stewart movie. It will remind them of reality: Some politicians are afraid to govern because they don’t want the responsibility or accountability. They simply want to cast blame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Special interest corruption and an attitude of “me, before the people” is an indelible stain on the fabric of our republic. Talk may be a step in the right direction, but it is still cheap. I would remind Thiel that the great-grandparents of the working-class Americans now paying the price for negativity, incompetence and corruption in government likely heard those same words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Thiel is on the right track. But it’s a track that goes in rhetorical circles. Since he’s an entrepreneur who knows how to “think outside the box,” maybe it’s time for him to jump the tracks and blaze his own trail to a better government for all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Douglas MacKinnon, a political and communications consultant, was a writer in the White House for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and former special assistant for policy and communications at the Pentagon during the last three years of the Bush administration.</p>",

        "description": "<p>(NEXSTAR) — Are you at your wit's end trying to calm your baby? Good news: researchers say they've cracked the code on how to soothe fussy infants who won't stop crying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the peer-reviewed study published by Current Biology, 21 infants were tested in 32 sessions using four different methods of soothing to get them back in their cribs peacefully. Overwhelmingly, researchers say, the winning process was what they call \"5-Minute Carrying, 5- to 8-Minute Sitting.\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t‘FatFIRE’ is the anti-‘quiet quitting’ — here’s how it works\t\n\n\n\n\n<p>Here's how it works, according to the study:</p>\n\n\n\nWith the baby in your arms, walk around for five minutes. Researchers say the lulling movement soothes crying and promotes sleep in babies.Before placing the baby down for sleep, sit with them in your arms for five to eight minutes. The stop-start motion helps prevent infants from waking after being laid down, researchers say.\n\n\n\n<p>Other methods tried on the babies included WalkHold (parent holds infant and walks around); SitHold (parent holds infant and sits); COT (infant was laid in a cot); and MCOT (infant placed in mobile crib or stroller and rocked back and forth). Researchers say these methods produced mixed results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some of the methods soothed initially, they didn't help the return to the crib. Others helped infants get to their cribs peacefully but didn't keep them asleep, according to the study.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For new parents, long bouts of crying — especially in the middle of a sleep-deprived night — can be among the top challenges with a new baby. The American Academy of Pediatrics says babies typically don't have regular sleep cycles until around 4 months. And although newborns sleep up to 16-17 hours per day, it's only in 1-2 hour increments, AAP says.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe scandal facing college ranking lists, explained\t\n\n\n\n\n<p>\"About 20-30% of infants cry excessively and exhibit sleep difficulties for no apparent reason, causing parental stress and even triggering impulsive child maltreatment in a small number of cases,\" the researchers write.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Authors said they hope their work is substantiated with even more studies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, AAP recommends a few behaviors to help babies sleep through the night, including making sure babies stay awake for longer periods of the day. Additionally, parents should make nighttime feeding times and interactions quieter, whispering if necessary.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/3646575-jan-6-panel-races-to-put-together-legislative-proposal/",
        "description": "<p>The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol is eyeing a laundry list of tasks as it seeks to pull together a legislative package to prevent future insurrections.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The committee for months has touted the legislative purpose to its investigation — a key detail as various subpoena recipients have sought to skirt compliance with the panel.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with the panel staring down a tight end-of-the-year deadline to complete its work, time is dwindling to introduce a package that could range from electoral reforms to enhanced criminal penalties. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have some minor factual loose ends to wrap up, but then really what we need to do is to make our sweeping legislative recommendations about what needs to be done to fortify America against coups and insurrections and political violence in the future,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We want to strengthen and fortify the electoral system and the right to vote. We want to do what we can to secure the situation of election workers and keep them safe from violence. We want to solidify the states in their determination that private armed militias not operate in the name of the state. You know, we don't have any kind of federal law or policy about private armed militias,” Raskin added, saying the last point was a personal interest of his.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vice Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) alluded to the wide range of legislative options as far back as October when the House was considering a contempt of Congress vote against onetime Trump strategist Stephen Bannon.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She cited Trump’s dereliction of duty in watching the riot unfold while doing little if anything to stop it, saying, “We are evaluating whether our criminal laws should be enhanced to apply more consequences to this type of behavior.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also pointed to Trump’s call to pressure Georgia’s secretary of state to “find” more votes, saying the panel was contemplating enhanced penalties for such actions in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cheney also floated that legislation could address Trump’s alleged pressure campaign at the Department of Justice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump’s attempt to reverse President Biden’s victory has also prompted the most publicly discussed efforts to reform the Electoral Count Act.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senate lawmakers introduced legislation that would reform the Electoral Count Act in July. A companion bill was introduced in the House this week by two lawmakers who do not serve on the Jan. 6 committee.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill seeks to clarify the role the vice president plays in certifying the results, specifically stating that it is purely ceremonial. The legislation also would raise the bar to successfully challenge a state’s Electoral College result, from just one House member and one senator from a state to 20 percent of a state’s congressional delegation.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also directly targets Trump’s fake elector scheme by largely leaving each state’s governor in charge of submitting electoral certificates to end the risk of any competing electors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) has her own Electoral Reform Act bill in the works — one she said would go beyond the measures outlined in the Senate legislation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While she says work on it is being “buttoned up,” it’s not clear when it will drop — though it’s scheduled to go to the House floor next week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawmakers have been more secretive about what legislative measures they might consider beyond reforming the Electoral Count Act. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You’ve got to wait on the recommendations and the findings,” Chair Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said in response to a question from The Hill.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they have offered some hints.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quinta Jurecic, a fellow at the Brooking Institution and a senior editor at Lawfare, said she’s seen ties between Cheney’s comments on the floor over a year ago and the structure of the hearings.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They're definitely really looking at the sort of the criminal law aspect and this question of whether or not Trump personally could be held accountable which I think is consistent with the hearings so far where you saw they were really leaning in on Trump's personal, moral and potentially legal culpability for the insurrection,” she said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claire Finkelstein, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania specializing in ethics, said there are already laws on the books that could be used to cover some of Trump’s behavior. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A call to [Georgia Secretary of State Brad] Raffensperger and anything like that is already illegal. So the idea that we should strengthen laws against interfering with elections on the part of a sitting president — we have all the laws we need. Or, for example, putting executive branch employees under political pressure to support his political campaign. That is a criminal violation of the Hatch Act,” she said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hatch Act, which bars coercing federal employees into political activity, has a little-known criminal provision, but it carries just a possible three-year prison sentence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the committee could also look at placing more specific limitations of the office of the presidency or clarifying that its occupant is subject to certain criminal penalties. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There is very much an ongoing discussion about whether or not the presidency as a whole really sort of needs to be rethought in wake of the experience with Trump — that he sort of showed how much a bad faith executive can get away with,” Jurecic said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finkelstein would like to see the panel specifically counter various memos from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel setting a policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“That policy — which is grounded in nothing in the Constitution, and dictated by nothing in existing law, and in fact, in our view, contradicts existing law — is policy only. It's not itself law,” she said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any such legislation could face a difficult path forward in Congress, but the multiple bipartisan efforts to change the Electoral College Act suggest the more modest reforms stand the best chance for passage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Raskin has said he would see such limited action as a failure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Donald Trump didn't set out to overthrow the Electoral Count Act, he set out to overthrow the election. And the election is far broader than just the Electoral Count Act,” he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We need to develop a comprehensive approach to guaranteeing voting rights and solidifying the electoral apparatus against coups and insurrections, political violence and electoral sabotage in the future,” he added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If all we did was to say that the vice president does not have the authority to nullify Electoral College votes, then we will not have lived up to this moment,” Raskin said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mychael Schnell contributed. </p>",

        "description": "<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a statement Saturday saying the main power line to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is working again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The agency said all four main external power lines for the nuclear plant were shut off in recent weeks, with Russian shelling causing damage to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 750-kilovolt line, one of the four lines, was shut off on Sept. 11 and reconnected on Sept. 16, according to the IAEA. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The restored 750 kilovolt (kV) line is now providing Europe’s largest nuclear power plant – whose last operating reactor was shut down on 11 September – with the electricity it needs for reactor cooling and other essential safety functions,” the statement read. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plant has been using backup power lines to continue safety functions but has not been providing power to houses, factories and other buildings that rely on it for electricity since Sept. 5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The three other main external 750 kV power lines that were lost earlier during the conflict remain down. All the ZNPP’s six reactors are in a cold shutdown state, but they still require power to maintain necessary safety functions,” the IAEA stated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nuclear plant is still under Russian control, the IAEA said, but Ukrainians are handling its operations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said there are still major concerns about the plant, despite the improvements, due to the conflict and shelling occurring in the areas around Zaporizhzhia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fighting between Ukraine and Russia near the facility — Europe's largest nuclear plant — has fueled fears of a nuclear disaster, which experts say could lead to radiation leakage that impacts local communities but likely would not result in a global catastrophe.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Minnesota Medical Association’s PAC endorsed Gov. Tim Walz (D) in his campaign for reelection, in an unconventional move for the organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In his four years leading Minnesota, Gov. Walz has demonstrated alignment with our core values of respect, honesty, and support for science and public health,” MEDPAC Chairman Will Nicholson said in a press release on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The endorsement represents a unique move for the PAC, which does not typically endorse candidates in state races, according to the Minnesota Medical Association.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The ongoing global pandemic and other critical healthcare issues are at stake this year and that compelled the organization to support a candidate who would best advocate for the health of Minnesotans,” Nicholson added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nicholson cited Walz’s policies on COVID-19, reproductive health care and gun control in the PAC's endorsement of the governor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PAC endorsed Walz over Republican nominee and fellow doctor Scott Jensen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jensen has said he is not vaccinated against COVID-19 and previously compared COVID-19 restrictions to those instituted during the rise of the Nazis in Germany, according to MPR News.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also previously asserted that he supports an abortion ban in Minnesota without exceptions for rape and incest unless the mother's life is in danger. However, he has since backtracked on that stance, saying he supports exceptions for victims of rape and incest as well, according to CNN.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/education/3647082-higher-ed-has-faults-but-dont-ignore-its-utility/",
        "description": "<p>In the wake of President Biden’s student-debt relief plan, critics are targeting the value of higher education — at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Bloomberg’s Romesh Ratnesar writes, the college-affordability crisis has left many “with debts they’ll never be able to repay.” For CNBC, philanthropist Laura Arnold argues a “dysfunctional system” enables “unmanageable debt from schools and programs that fail to deliver on educational promises.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although such critiques may have some merit, we must be careful not to take them as grounds to dismiss the entire enterprise of higher learning. As the country’s foundational (small-l) liberal democratic ideals are under threat, there is real value that higher education can provide: Done well, higher education — particularly liberal arts and legal education — makes the ground fertile for a durable democracy by inculcating the habits of mind necessary for well-functioning civil society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The liberal democratic republic that was formed to “secure the blessings of liberty” is being tested in our time as vast swaths of the public — across the political spectrum — agitate for illiberal ideas. We see this pattern manifest in innumerable ways: through efforts to ban books in schools; to prevent speakers some may dislike from speaking altogether; to prohibit education about historical truths and their connection to our present. We see attempts to frame history exclusively through a modern lens; to use educational institutions to convey an ideology rather than to transmit knowledge and the tools of free inquiry; to empower partisans to undermine the machinery of elections; to favor equality of outcomes over equality of opportunity; to use violence to obstruct government and the lawful transition of power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These and other developments illustrate a popular embrace of a new illiberalism: restricting rights, freedom of thought, and the rule of law, and replacing them with a tribalism concerned more with group-based cultural dominance and distributional hegemony.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although some might assign some blame to colleges and universities — which in many instances have fostered or even modeled this new illiberalism — those same institutions can play a significant role in bringing our country back from the brink of this abyss. This is particularly the case for law schools and for other institutions that embrace a liberal arts approach to education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A true liberal arts education — one that does not suppress free thought through a doctrinaire inculcation of an ideological orthodoxy but, rather, gives the broad exposure and analytical tools needed to understand and imagine the world as it was, is, and can be, and develops intellectual courage and humility — equips a citizenry that can steward rather than stymie the liberal ideals essential for a thriving democratic republic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best legal education sharpens the mind by training it to consider arguments from multiple angles, to marshal facts to make a case, and to clearly and effectively articulate views in oral and written form. Such an education can occur only in an environment that fosters the open exchange of a wide range of ideas. As John Stuart Mill wrote in On Liberty, this free exchange is vital to a liberal society because when such exchanges are suppressed, that robs the human race: “If the opinion is right, [dissenters] are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error,” Mill wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This exposure to complex and competing ideas found in liberal arts and legal education expands the mind’s capacity to analyze information and to think critically, core abilities for citizens of a liberal democracy. One key contributor to the new illiberalism is disinformation — the deliberate transmission of false information designed to mislead. Siloed into information echo chambers that are magnified over social media, citizens bereft of an expansive knowledge of the world and of critical and analytical thinking skills become susceptible to a herd mentality in which feelings-based belief — more so than thought — governs the mind. The embrace of illiberal ideas that seems rampant today is the inevitable result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>College and university leaders must ensure that their institutions are transmitting the skills and values that will inoculate students against falling into this trap. To keep our democracy strong, we need to continue to develop values such as curiosity and respect, an understanding of our common humanity, and an openness to heterodoxy. We also need to develop skills such as the ability to engage in evidence-based reasoning, to identify and avoid logical fallacies, and — as psychologist Karl Weick urged — to “argue as if you are right and listen as if you are wrong.” That is what higher education at its best should be delivering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benjamin Franklin is quoted as having told a bystander after the Constitutional Convention that he and his compatriots had developed \"A republic . . . if you can keep it.\" We all should ensure that our institutions of higher education live up to their role of buttressing liberal democracy by equipping rather than hobbling the mind. Supporting these institutions to prepare citizens not only to lead but to contribute as intelligent participants in our civil society benefits all of us because it ensures that the republic that we have inherited will not be as tenuous as Franklin feared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> A. Benjamin Spencer is dean of the William &amp; Mary Law School.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Democratic Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman mocked Republican opponent Mehmet Oz and Republican Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano on Friday using a “Jersey Boys” meme following reports that the latter candidate was registered to vote in New Jersey until last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fetterman, the lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania, responded to an article published by the New Jersey Globe that reported Mastriano was registered to vote in the state for 28 years until election officials changed his status to inactive last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article also mentioned Oz’s past residence and record of voting in New Jersey and reported that the candidate could legally vote in the state if he chose not to vote in Pennsylvania.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fetterman’s meme used an image from the musical “Jersey Boys” with images of Oz and Mastriano added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Democrat followed the meme with a video compilation of Oz discussing his residence in New Jersey, captioning the tweet: “He now refers to himself in ads as ‘Pennsylvania's doctor.’ But he will always be JERSEY STRONG.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video included six instances of Oz saying, “I live in New Jersey” and one of him saying he is from the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fetterman's campaign has sought for months to portray Oz as a carpetbagger from New Jersey, employing various methods — including an airplane banner and a petition to add the Republican candidate to the New Jersey Hall of Fame — to troll him over the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Monmouth University poll released on Wednesday found that Fetterman had a 9-point lead over Oz in the race to replace Republican Sen. Pat Toomey (Pa.).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fetterman’s favorability rating among Pennsylvanians surveyed was 11 points higher than Oz's, while Oz’s unfavorability rating was 14 points higher than Fetterman's.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, a Monmouth University poll released on Friday found Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro leading Mastriano by 18 points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hill has reached out to Oz and Mastriano for comment on the reports.</p>",

These new features were announced via the Google Workspace blog, but are not necessarily just for Workspace customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, iOS users are able to select multiple images and videos and send them all at once in a Google Chat message. Thankfully, the same capability is now rolling out to Android users as well, with Workspace Rapid Release domains getting it as early as two days ago (September 15th, 2022). The plan for Scheduled Release domains is to begin the rollout on September 30, 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the Smart Reply feature in Chat, which suggests quick responses to messages based on your habits, is gaining the ability to respond in three new languages. These replies were initially only offered in English, but now will be able auto-detect the language you are writing in. If that language is Spanish, French, or Portuguese, then the suggested auto-reply will be offered in that same language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new feature will be on by default and is available now for all users on web with no admin control. Users can update their Smart Reply preferences within Google Chat or Gmail by clicking on Settings, then navigating to “Smart Reply.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Neither of the above new features will be tied to any specific Google Workspace tiers and will also be available to personal Google Accounts. I truly appreciate when helpful features like these are made available to all Google users and not just those with a paid plan. Hopefully there is more to come as more users get comfortable with using Google Chat as a replacement to other messaging apps.</p>\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

That click came in the form of his timing and load looking better, and smoother than it ever has. Judge is not a typical hitter in the sense that his foot hits the ground, and he makes his swing decision from there. Instead, he keeps his swing timing within a small window and rotates out of his hip cork and gets his barrel far out in front of the plate. Let’s do some video storytelling.</p>\n\n\n<p>Should this article just be all Judge homers over and over? I wish, but I have a word count requirement to adhere to. I picked these two home runs for a reason. Judge’s swing has been perfected to smoke home runs from left center to right field and sliders from left center to the left field foul pole. The benefit of having an extremely deep bat path is you can cover a wide range of depths in the hitting zone. In his initial entry into the zone, he enters rather flat, making the lower launch angle home runs he hits to right field pretty intuitive. As he progresses through the zone and in front of it, his attack angle begins to increase as he s creates more loft and keeps his barrel in the hitting zone, albeit much further out.</p>\n<p>Before his barrel enters the zone, he gets extremely deep into his hip and creates almost a 45 degree angle with his back. Think of the angle you would want to create with your body to jump up as high as you can. There is a lot of hinge! Judge does that very well in his swing and because of it, creates one of the deepest barrel baths I’ve ever seen.</p>\n<p>Many hitters aren’t capable of doing that. 99’s main focus in hitting is feeling his load into his rear hip and uncoiling depending on how he recognizes a pitch. The reason this cue doesn’t help a large group of hitters is because it puts too much focus on the posterior. When creating hip and shoulder separation while hitting, you can get stuck if you’re too focused on what your back side needs to do. Getting stuck on your back foot/leg can negatively impact the direction of rotation, and as a result, steepen your bat path.</p>\n<p>Most guys will hit foot strike and use the force they absorb with that leg as a barrier to hold their swing off as long as possible until they want to pull the trigger. The better a hitter can do this with great resistance, the more likely it is they can make hard contact consistently. The two hitters that come to mind are Mookie Betts and Mike Trout. </p>\n\n\n<p>When watching them, they have abrupt stops in their swings that are followed by an explosion. That’s the act of their front hit hitting the ground, decelerating to a stop, and transferring that energy back up the chain. They do it better than anybody else, but it’s a common trait among elite hitters with high hit tools. Judge’s swing is more dependent on him getting out of his rear hip. He doesn’t transfer quite as much force into that front foot. He instead keeps it stored in his posterior. It goes without saying you can be successful in more than one way, but Judge’s immense power and size allow him to hit like this. He has to in order to consistently pull balls in the air, something we know is crucial for his home run success.</p>\n<p>If Judge’s focus in his swing is on the rotating in and out of the rear hip, then it’s likely that the landing leg isn’t all that on his mind for a reason. Of course, he lands just like any hitter; it’s not like he’s hitting off one leg. But it’s clearly not his focus. Does that restrict his ability to adjust to off-speed pitches? It does, but if the rest of his swing is perfected for fastballs and sliders, then how much does it matter? Well, the numbers say not so much!</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>See! I wasn’t lying about him dominating these two pitches. You basically can’t get away with throwing these anywhere near the middle of the zone more than once in an at-bat against Judge this year. His strength and swing path have gotten to the point where you have the tiniest window to beat him, and if you miss a spot, it’s likely in the path of his gargantuan barrel. I know you don’t need a nerd like me to explain why Judge is doing what he’s doing. He’s a very large human. However, there is a reason why the home runs have come more often this year, and it’s because he has perfected the feel of rotating out of his rear hip. He can do it over and over again, and that means dingers at a historic rate. </p>",

        "description": "Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are only getting better. | Chuck Cook-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>It’s important to remember that they’re still just 24 and 25.</p> <p>As Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown try to establish themselves as the league’s clear-cut most dynamic duo, it’s easy to forget how young they still are.</p>\n<p>Tatum may not be 19 anymore, but he’s only 24. Brown, as mature as he is, turns just 26 in October. They’ve experienced more success – and more agony – than most players do in their entire career.</p>\n<p>It’s absolutely clear at this point that they’re better together than they are apart, and anyone who says otherwise isn’t worth arguing with at a bar. The craziest part is, they’re still getting better, and there’s no reason to believe they’re going to stop anytime soon.</p>\n<p>The best players add elements to their game. Steph Curry has become a far better driver and defender. LeBron James improved significantly as a shooter. Giannis Antetokounmpo’s poise and decision-making have come a long way. Joel Embiid now thrives as a passer.</p>\n<p>Tatum and Brown will continue to do the same in their own way. Yes, they struggled in stretches last season, but their shortcomings are all fixable. Without their brilliant overall play, there would have been no remarkable turnaround and no dramatic run to the NBA Finals.</p>\n  \n        \n      Photo by Garrett Ellwood/NBAE via Getty Images\n  \n<p>It’s fair to criticize them, but it’s not fair to assume they’ll never rectify those issues. There’s no doubt that Brown (when he’s above water) has spent countless hours fine-tuning his handle this offseason. Tatum has certainly allocated time toward learning how to handle doubles and find open teammates. </p>\n<p>They’ll come back even better. They’ve done it every year.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to remember that building toward a championship can be a long and arduous process, even for many of the all-time greats. Remember that James didn’t win his first championship until age 27. Neither did Curry. Michael Jordan, Shaquille O’Neal, and Kevin Durant were 28 when they won their first title. These things take time, and the agonizing journey to the mountaintop makes the view even sweeter.</p>\n<p>If their past trajectory is any indication, Tatum and Brown will get there. Tatum has upped his points per game (13.9, 15.7, 23.4, 26.4, 26.9), rebounds per game (5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 7.4, 8.0) and assists per game (1.6, 2.1, 3.0, 4.3, 4.4) every single year. He shot a career-high 52.4 percent from inside the arc this past season and got to the free-throw line a career-high 6.2 times. </p>\n<p>He also had a career-best offensive rating of 115.5, net rating of 12.1 and player impact estimate of 15.9. Tatum had the most points and assists of any player in the playoffs and was more often than not the best player on the floor – until the Finals, of course.</p>\n  \n        \n      Photo by Jim Davis/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n  \n<p>The next steps:</p>\n<p>A) Becoming more efficient from 3-point range: He attempted a career-high 8.6 3’s per game but shot a career-low 35.3 percent last season.</p>\n<p>B) Valuing the ball more: He turned it over a career-high 2.9 times. Against the Warriors, he looked confused and out of sorts whenever pressure came his way. Hire Tacko Fall to obstruct his vision if you have to. He needs to get better in that area, and he’s fully capable.</p>\n<p>C) Piecing together complete games: Tatum often got hot in stretches in the second and third quarters and ripped off six-to-eight points in short spurts. If he can play efficiently at the beginning and end of games, that will go a long way.</p>\n<p>Brown, meanwhile, posted a career-high 3.5 assists, player impact estimate of 13.5 and net rating of 9.8. He at times looked more in command and even more assertive than ever, but at times, he looked like he completely forgot how to dribble. Frankly, it was quite perplexing.</p>\n<p>It’s an odd situation, where one of the games most dynamic and explosive players sometimes lost his superpowers at crucial moments. One moment he’d be blowing past a defender and throwing down a vicious dunk, and the next he’d be fumbling it and setting up an easy fast-break opportunity for the opponent.</p>\n  \n        \n      Photo by Jim Davis/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n  \n<p>The next steps:</p>\n<p>A) Hold on to that sucker: Sometimes Brown has a tendency to pursue the spectacular play over the solid one. Listen to Brad Stevens. Hit singles. Make the right read and don’t overcomplicate it. Basketball is a simple game, especially with the recent influx of talent on the roster. Less can be more on a team with so much firepower.</p>\n<p>B) Regain his efficiency: Brown shot 47.3 percent from the floor and 35.8 percent from 3, both of which were his lowest marks since at least 2019-20. Getting those percentages up to 50 and 40 is a realistic goal.</p>\n<p>C) Stay true to himself: Whether it’s in transition, off a well-timed cut or in a 1-on-1 situation (while under control, of course), Brown is at his best when he’s getting to the rim. He averaged just 3.2 fast break points last year, which is way down from his career-best 4.5 in 2019-20. He also averaged 9.9 points in the paint, which is lower than his mark the year prior. Getting easy buckets gets him going, which then tends to organically improve his handle.</p>\n<p>Remember when Tatum and Brown just entered the league? Many thought Tatum wasn’t the best player in his class. Many thought Brown was picked too high his year. Both have lived up to expectations and are well on their way to ultimately exceeding them.</p>\n<p>Neither player is finished, and their story is told best as a duo. They will become NBA champions together, and it very well may happen this year. Stay patient, and remember the best is almost certainly yet to come.</p>",

        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/carlsen-niemann-chess-cheating-poker/671472/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "<p>It was as if a bottom seed had knocked out the top team in March Madness: At the Sinquefield Cup chess tournament in St. Louis earlier this month, an upstart American teenager named Hans Niemann snapped the 53-game unbeaten streak of world champion Magnus Carlsen, perhaps the game’s best player of all time. But the real uproar came the following day, when Carlsen posted a cryptic tweet announcing his withdrawal that included a meme video stating, “If I speak I am in big trouble.” The king appeared to have leveled an unspoken accusation of cheating—and the chess world, in turn, exploded.</p><p>Some of the biggest names in chess launched attacks on Niemann in the subsequent days, while others rushed to defend him. Niemann, by his own recent admission, has cheated at online chess at least twice before, when he was 12 and 16 years old. These past offenses, combined with what some believed was lackluster chess analysis in his postgame interviews, have heightened suspicions of foul play. On Twitch and Twitter, players and fans theorized that Niemann might have been receiving secret messages encoded in the vibrations of electronic shoe inserts or remote-controlled anal beads. No concrete evidence of cheating has emerged, and the 19-year-old grandmaster vehemently denied accusations of misconduct in St. Louis, vowing to an interviewer that he has never cheated in an over-the-board game and has learned from prior mistakes.</p><p>Whatever really happened here, everyone agrees that for Niemann, or anyone else, to cheat at chess in 2022 would be conceptually simple. In the past 15 years, widely available AI software packages, known as “chess engines,” have been developed to the point where they can easily demolish the world’s best chess players—so all a cheater has to do to win is figure out a way to channel a machine’s advice. That’s not the only way that computers have recently reshaped the landscape of a 1,500-year-old sport. Human players, whether novices or grandmasters, now find inspiration in the outputs of these engines, and they train themselves by memorizing computer moves. In other words, chess engines have redefined creativity in chess, leading to a situation where the game’s top players can no longer get away with simply playing the strongest chess they can, but must also engage in subterfuge, misdirection, and other psychological techniques. In that sense, the recent cheating scandal only shows the darker side of what chess slowly has become.</p><p>The computer takeover of chess occurred, at least in the popular imagination, 25 years ago, when the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue defeated world champion Garry Kasparov. Newsrooms at the time declared the match a “Greek tragedy,” in which a silicon “hand of God” had squashed humanity. Yet 1997, despite its cultural resonance, was not really an inflection point for chess. Deep Blue, a nearly 3,000-pound, one-of-a-kind supercomputer, could hardly change the game by itself. Its genius seemed reliant on then-unthinkable processing power and the grandmasters who had advised in its creation, to the point where Kasparov, after losing, could accuse IBM of having cheated by supplying the machine with human assistance—a dynamic that today’s accusations of foul play have reversed.</p><p>[Read: When computers started beating chess champions]</p><p>By the mid-2000s, though, upgrades in chess-engine software and commercial hardware made overpowering algorithms more accessible; in 2006, an engine running on a standard desktop computer defeated then–world champion Vladimir Kramnik. Players had already been using engines to evaluate individual tactics. But Kramnik’s loss kicked off the first era of computer-chess superiority, in which even chess elites would rely on software to help evaluate their strategies, Matthew Sadler, a grandmaster who has written multiple books on chess engines, told me.</p><p>As engines became widespread, the game shifted. Elite chess has always involved rote learning, but “the amount of stuff you need to prepare, the amount of stuff you need to remember, has just exploded,” Sadler said. Engines can calculate positions far more accurately and rapidly than humans, so there’s more material to be studied than ever before. What once seemed magical became calculable; where one could rely on intuition came to require rigorous memorization and training with a machine. Chess, once poetic and philosophical, was acquiring elements of a spelling bee: a battle of preparation, a measure of hours invested. “The thrill used to be about using your mind creatively and working out unique and difficult solutions to strategical problems,” the grandmaster Wesley So, the fifth-ranked player in the world, told me via email. “Not testing each other to see who has the better memorization plan.”</p><p>Once computers were reliably beating grandmasters, cheating-by-computer became a serious threat, Emil Sutovsky, the director general of the International Chess Federation, told me. The federation implemented its first anti-cheating measures in 2008.</p><p>That’s not to say chess was “solved” (in the sense that a perfect set of moves has been devised for every position), as checkers is; there are more possible chess games than atoms in the observable universe. Sadler believes “human frailty”—that we aren’t machines—kept chess exciting: People would still forget their pregame analysis, fail to predict their opponent’s strategy, and end up in positions they hadn’t prepared for. The computers in this first era of chess engines were very good on defense, but they still had weaknesses, Sutovsky said, such as struggling to determine the value of sacrificing a piece for long-term benefit.</p><p>But that all changed on December 5, 2017, when AI researchers at Alphabet announced a new algorithm, AlphaZero, which had surpassed the best existing chess engine simply by playing games against itself—over the course of just four hours. AlphaZero used a neural network, an approach to artificial intelligence that mimics the human brain and, in a sense, allows a machine to learn. Other chess engines quickly incorporated the new technology, heralding the modern era of total computer domination.</p><p>[Read: How checkers was solved]</p><p>In the first era, humans would devise attack strategies, then refine them in games against machines. AlphaZero crushed these earlier engines by “playing extremely aggressive chess,” Sadler said. The modern, neural-net engines are eager to sacrifice; and they exhibit a strong grasp of openings, positional structure, and long-term strategy. “It started to look a bit more [like] a human way to play,” Sutovsky told me, in describing this transformation. Or even superhuman, he said: The new chess engines seemed to have insight into “the tactical skirmish, but also could plan for some long-lasting compensation for material loss.”</p><p>To understand just how superior machines have become, consider chess’s “Elo” rating system, which compares players’ relative strength and was devised by a Hungarian American physicist. The highest-ever human rating, achieved by Carlsen twice over the past decade, was 2882. DeepBlue’s Elo rating was 2853. A chess engine called Rybka was the first to reach 3000 points, in 2007; and today’s most powerful program, Stockfish, currently has more than 3500 Elo points by conservative estimates. That means Stockfish has about a 98 percent probability of beating Carlsen in a match and, per one estimate, a 2 percent chance of drawing. (An outright victory for Carlsen would be almost impossible.)</p><p>Where chess engines once evaluated human strategies, the new, upgraded versions—which are freely available online, including Stockfish—now generate surprising ideas and define the ideal way to play the game, to the point that human performance is measured in terms of “centipawn” (hundredths of a pawn) loss relative to what a computer would play. While training, a player might ask the software to suggest a set of moves to fit a given situation, and then decide to use the computer’s sixth-ranked option, rather than the first, in the hopes of confusing a human competitor who trained with similar algorithms. Or they might choose a move tailored to the weaknesses of a particular opponent. Many chess experts have adopted the new engines’ more aggressive style, and the algorithms have popularized numerous tactics that human players had previously underestimated.</p><p>The advent of neural-net engines thrills many chess players and coaches, including Sutovsky and Sadler. Carlsen said he was “inspired” the first time he saw AlphaZero play. Engines have made it easier for amateurs to improve, while unlocking new dimensions of the game for experts. In this view, chess engines have not eliminated creativity but instead redefined what it means to be creative.</p><p>[Read: Befriending the queen of chess]</p><p>Yet if computers set the gold standard of play, and top players can only try to mimic them, then it’s not clear what, exactly, humans are creating. “Due to the predominance of engine use today,” the grandmaster So explained, “we are being encouraged to halt all creative thought and play like mechanical bots. It’s so boring. So beneath us.” And if elite players stand no chance against machines, instead settling for outsmarting their human opponents by playing subtle, unexpected, or suboptimal moves that weaponize “human frailty,” then modern-era chess looks more and more like a game of psychological warfare: not so much a spelling bee as a round of poker.</p><p>In that context, cheating scandals may be nothing less than a natural step in chess’s evolution. Poker, after all, has been rocked by allegations of foul play for years, including cases where players are accused of getting help from artificial intelligence. When the highest form of creativity is outfoxing your opponent—as has always been true of poker—breaking rules seems only natural.</p>",

        "description": "<p>U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss will hold a bilateral meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday at the U.N. General Assembly, her office said Saturday. The pair had previously been scheduled to meet in Downing Street on Sunday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>No reason was given for the postponement of what will be the leaders’ first meeting since Truss won the Conservative leadership contest and became prime minister. It will be a “full bilateral meeting,” according to the U.K. statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden is among the many leaders heading to London ahead of Queen Elizabeth II’s state funeral on Monday. Truss is still slated to meet on Sunday with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Polish President Andrzej Duda. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunday evening, Truss is scheduled to attend a Buckingham Palace reception for visiting world leaders, and will observe a minute’s silence on the doorstep of No. 10 Downing Street.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She met on Saturday with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern at the government’s Chevening country residence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truss also held a phone call with UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan. A call between Truss and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is scheduled to take place Saturday evening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden is set to address the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday, after his speech was pushed back a day due to the queen’s funeral. The day of the funeral is now designated a bank holiday in the U.K.</p>",

When many diners were left deserted after the pandemic, she started to photograph the empty booths and counters. </p><p>“We’re no longer gathering in the way we once did,” she says. “America is a polarised nation. Highlighting the emptiness at a table, in a quintessentially American space, can serve as a metaphor for the current divisions among the people in this country.”</p>Lunch Poems by Leah Frances will be published next month in the US by Aliens in Residence Continue reading...",

Louis Varland has also been tabbed for the expanded roster; he gets the start in the first game. Corresponding moves are as follows:</p>\n\n\n<p>Two Minnesotans coming up to the roster: Matt Wallner is being called up today by the #MNTwins and Louie Varland being added as today’s 29th man and Game 1 starter.<br /><br />Max Kepler to the IL.

For storm information specific to your area outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK ---------------------- Data from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that Fiona's center has re-formed farther east. At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fiona was located near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 63.5 West. Fiona is moving toward the west near 8 mph (13 km/h). A west-northwestward motion at a similar forward speed is expected to begin later today, followed by a turn toward the northwest by Sunday evening. On the forecast track, the center of Fiona is expected to move near or south of the Virgin Islands this evening, approach Puerto Rico tonight, and move near or over Puerto Rico Sunday night. Fiona should then move near the Dominican Republic on Monday. Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and Fiona is expected to become a hurricane by Sunday or Sunday night while moving near Puerto Rico. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km) from the center. Data from the reconnaissance aircraft indicate that the minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND ---------------------- Key messages for Tropical Storm Fiona can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml. WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected on Puerto Rico Sunday and Sunday night and are possible in the U.S. Virgin Islands tonight. Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in the Dominican Republic Sunday night and Monday. Tropical storm conditions will continue across portions of the Leeward Islands within the warning area through this afternoon. Tropical storm conditions will reach the U.S. and British Virgin Islands this afternoon, spread westward across Puerto Rico tonight, and reach portions of the Dominican Republic Sunday night. Tropical storm conditions are possible across the watch area in the Dominican Republic Sunday night. RAINFALL: Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall: Leeward Islands and Northern Windward Islands: Additional 2 to 4 inches. British and U.S. Virgin Islands: 4 to 6 inches with local maximum of 10 inches possible. Puerto Rico: 12 to 16 inches with local maximum of 20 inches possible, particularly across eastern and southern Puerto Rico. Dominican Republic: 4 to 8 inches with local maximum of 12 inches possible, particularly on the far eastern coast. Haiti: 1 to 3 inches with isolated maximum totals of 4 inches. Turks and Caicos: 4 to 6 inches. These rains are likely to produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, particularly southern and eastern Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic. STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas in areas of onshore winds if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide... Southern coast of Puerto Rico...1 to 3 ft Vieques and Culebra...1 to 3 ft U.S. Virgin Islands...1 to 2 ft Localized coastal flooding is also possible elsewhere in Puerto Rico. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office. Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore winds in the Dominican Republic. SURF: Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Leeward Islands, the northern Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas. These conditions could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.</p><p>Here’s the forecast track of Fiona, including the cone of uncertainty for the path of Fiona’s center:</p>Forecast track of FionaNWS National Hurricane Center<p>The National Hurricane Center will issue several Fiona updates today and through the coming days.</p><p>Weather nugget</p><p>So far this year, precipitation at International Falls is running one foot above normal.

        "description": "A spike in natural gas prices amid a hot summer is contributing to high electricity bills across the United States. Here, the sun sets behind electric power lines in Redondo Beach, Calif., on Aug. 31.Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images<p>If air-conditioning your home felt expensive this summer, get ready, because turning up the heat may cost even more this winter.</p><p>The rising utility bills are being driven by the surge in the price of natural gas, which generates about 40% of the United States' electricity.</p><p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects this surge to last through the winter, given that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has reduced overall supplies while global consumption remains high.</p><p>Here's what's behind the spike in prices and how it could impact you.</p>Russia is weaponizing its natural gas supplies<p>There's much less natural gas in the world these days because of Russia.</p><p>For years, Russia supplied Europe with cheap natural gas to power its factories and heat its homes. But after the West imposed sanctions for the war in Ukraine, Russia slashed its supplies, effectively weaponizing its natural gas.</p><p>While the global supply has dropped, demand has remained high.</p><p>In the U.S., half of homes use natural gas for heating or cooling.</p><p>Given how hot this summer was for parts of the U.S., many had their air conditioners working overtime.</p><p>U.S. natural gas inventories have also dropped this year, which together has driven up prices around 300% from just a few years ago.</p>What will this mean for prices in the U.S.?<p>Prices are expected to keep climbing.</p><p>Even though the country's inventory of liquid natural gas is low, this hasn't stopped the U.S. from exporting large amounts to Europe to help fill the void left by Russia.</p><p>U.S. natural gas producers have an incentive to export since they stand to profit from the spike in global prices.</p><p>\"If the price they can get in Europe is a lot more than what they can sell their natural gas for in the U.S., then some of that is going to be exported to Europe, and that is going to raise the price of things in the United States,\" says Ellen Wald, an oil and gas expert with the Atlantic Council.</p><p>\"Not to the levels that we're seeing in Europe, but we could continue to see more expensive energy costs in the U.S. because of this,\" she adds.</p><p>There's also a geopolitical argument for stepping up supplies to Europe. The European Union is a huge trading partner, and major economic disruptions there could send aftershocks to the United States.</p>How much will electricity bills go up?<p>Bills could go up a lot, especially in a state like Texas, which is the largest natural gas-consuming state, followed by California.</p><p>The National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) estimates the average family may pay more than $1,200 to heat their home this winter. That's $175 more than last winter, which is notable considering that nearly 40% of families are already feeling financially strapped, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.</p><p>The 40% of U.S. homes that use natural gas could see their winter heating costs increase by a third, according to NEADA, which could keep inflation up.</p><p>But much of this also depends on winter weather. The U.S. could be spared a massive spike if it's a mild winter.</p>Russia reduced natural gas supplies to Europe after the West imposed sanctions, leading to higher global prices for natural gas. Here, the logo of Russia's energy giant Gazprom is displayed at a petrol station in Moscow in September.Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP via Getty ImagesHow long could this last?<p>A lot depends on whether Russia will turn its gas taps back on for Europe ahead of winter. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this month that Russia will resume gas flows only if the West lifts sanctions.</p><p>The other big factor is how quickly Europe can find alternative natural gas sources.</p><p>Right now, Europe gets most of its gas through pipelines, but it's racing to set up additional infrastructure to receive liquefied natural gas, which can be transported by sea from countries such as Qatar.</p><p>That will take time, but over the long term it would free Europe from depending on Russia for a key commodity.</p><p>\"Europe will be in a better place because it will have completely gotten rid of its dependency on Russian gas,\" says Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at the Economist Intelligence Unit. \"After a few years, Russia won't be able to weaponize gas supplies anymore.\"</p><p>Until then, as the U.S. continues exporting its supplies to Europe and demand remains high, this price spike may be here awhile. </p><p>Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "<p></p>\n<p>By Carol Tannenhauser</p>\n<p>Taste of the Upper West Side is the 14th annual neighborhood food event and fundraiser, hosted by the Columbus Avenue Business Improvement District (BID). Held under a tent in the schoolyard on Columbus Avenue between 76th and 77th Streets, it takes place this year on Friday, September 30, and Saturday, October 1, and will feature 32 restaurants each evening, including several new places that are planning to open soon.</p>\n<p>The way it works is, you buy a ticket that is all-inclusive of unlimited food, wine, spirits, music, and entertainment. As always, there will be “the ultimate confectioners’ corner.” All are centered around innovative seasonal fare.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>“We have had a great advance sale and anticipate we will be sold out by event time,” said Don Evans, organizer of the event. “I’m hoping West Siders come out in force to support these 64 restaurants over the two-day festival. These chefs/restaurant owners have gone through hell the past two-and-a-half years to still stay open. With the new restaurants that have opened this past year, we have become one of strongest restaurant communities in the city.”</p>\n<p>All proceeds go back into the community and help fund neighborhood projects through the Columbus Avenue BID.

In his last four games with an at-bat, he is 8-for-18 (.444) with a double, two triples, two home runs and three RBI, and he has registered six hits in nine at-bats in his last two games at Wrigley Field (also 4-for-5 on September 11).\n\nSTARTING PITCHING: Cubs starting pitchers have posted a 3.03 ERA (90 earned runs in 267 innings) since the All-Star break, the third-best mark in the majors during that span.\n\nSCORING FIRST: The Cubs have scored 92 runs in the first inning this season and 170 during the game’s first two innings, the second-most in the majors behind the Dodgers (192). However, the Cubs are just 21-22 when leading after the first inning and 34-26 when leading after the second.\n\n<p>Here are today’s particulars.</p>\n<p>Cubs lineup:</p>\n\n\n<p>Here is today's #Cubs starting lineup against the Rockies. pic.twitter.com/F7dsgcFj85</p>— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Rockies lineup:</p>\n\n\n<p>Colorado Rockies lineup:<br />1.

The first one was outstanding; the second, not quite so much. Overall: 8⅔ innings, six hits, two walks (0.923 WHIP), three runs (two HR), 3.12 ERA.</p>\n<p>He has obviously never faced the Rockies or anyone on their active roster. The graphic below shows a pretty good mix of pitches, so far in the major leagues (149 pitches) he’s relied primarily on his slider, though there’s a good mix of various types of fastballs as well.</p>\n<p>Good luck in your first MLB start, Hayden!</p>\n<p>Jose Ureña has been around since the Marlins let him go at the end of 2020. He spent last year with the Tigers and has been with both the Brewers and Rockies this year. </p>\n<p>He threw an inning-plus in garbage time for the Brewers against the Cubs April 9, and in 13 starts for the Rox he’s posted a 6.08 ERA and 1.650 WHIP, which are not good numbers. </p>\n<p>When he was with the Marlins he had a reputation as a bit of a headhunter, leading the league in HBP in 2017 and 2018. But he has not hit a batter at all in 74⅓ innings this year, so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.</p>\n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \n<p>Today’s game is on Marquee Sports Network.

        "description": "<p>The big story in the news over the past couple of days is that Florida governor Ron DeSantis chartered two planes to fly about 50 migrants, most of whom were from Venezuela, to Martha’s Vineyard, off the coast of Massachusetts. <br /><br />The story is still developing. Although DeSantis is the governor of Florida, the migrants appear to have come from Texas, and it currently appears that they were lured onto the planes—paid for with taxpayer money—with the false promise of work and housing in New York City or Boston. In addition, there are allegations from a lawyer working with the migrants that officials from the Department of Homeland Security falsified information about the migrants to set them up for automatic deportation. As I write this, it is not clear what their actual status is: have they applied for asylum and been processed, or are they undocumented immigrants?<br /><br />As Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo says, none of it adds up. <br /><br />None of it, that is, except the politics. DeSantis apparently dispatched the migrants with a videographer to take images of them arriving, entirely unexpectedly, on the upscale island, presumably in an attempt to present the image that Democratic areas can’t handle immigrants (in fact, more than 12% of the island’s 17,000 full-time residents were born in foreign countries, and 22% of the residents are non-white). But the residents of the island greeted the migrants; found beds, food, and medical care; and worked with authorities to move them back to the mainland where there are support services and housing. In the meantime, there are questions about the legality of DeSantis chartering planes to move migrants from state to state.<br /><br />There are two big stories behind DeSantis’s move. <br /><br />First is that the Republicans are on the ropes over the Supreme Court’s June 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health decision and the capture of the party by its MAGA wing. That slide into radical extremism means the party is contracting, but it is not clear at all that base voters will show up in the midterms without former president Trump on the ballot.<br /><br />Rallying voters with threats of “aliens” swamping traditional society is a common tactic of right-wing politicians; it was the central argument that brought Hungary’s Viktor Orbán into his current authoritarian position. Republican governors Greg Abbott of Texas and Doug Ducey of Arizona have been bussing migrants to Washington—about 10,000 of them—saying they would bring the immigrant issue to the doorsteps of Democrats. Now DeSantis is in on the trick.<br /><br />Immigrants are nothing new to northern cities, of course. The U.S. is in a period of high immigration. Currently, 15% of the inhabitants of Washington, D.C., are foreign born, only slightly less than the 16.8% of the population of Texas that is foreign born. About 29% of the inhabitants of Boston come from outside U.S. borders, as do 36% of the inhabitants of New York City. <br /><br />In the lead-up to the midterms, Republicans have tried to distract from their unpopular stands on abortion, contraception, marriage equality, and so on, by hammering on the idea that the Democrats have created “open borders”; that criminal immigrants are bringing in huge amounts of drugs, especially fentanyl; and that Biden is secretly flying undocumented immigrants into Republican states in the middle of the night. Beginning in July, they began to insist that the country is being “invaded.”<br /><br />In fact, the border is not “open.” Fences, surveillance technology, and about 20,000 Border Patrol agents make the border more secure than it has ever been. That means apprehensions of undocumented migrants are up, with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recording more than 3 million encounters at the border since January 2021. Those high numbers reflect people stopped from coming in and are artificially inflated because many who are stopped try again. CBP estimates that about 27% of those stopped at the border are repeat apprehensions. <br /><br />Although much fentanyl is being stopped, some is indeed coming in, but through official ports of entry in large trucks or cars, not on individual migrants, who statistically are far less likely than native-born Americans to commit crimes. And the federal government is not secretly flying anyone anywhere (although, ironically, DeSantis is); U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sometimes moves migrants between detention centers, and CBP transfers unaccompanied children to the Department of Health and Human Services. These flights have been going on for years. <br /><br />The second story is the history of American immigration, which is far more complicated and interesting than the current news stories suggest. <br /><br />Mexican immigration is nothing new; our western agribusinesses were built on migrant labor of Mexicans, Japanese, and poor whites, among others, in the late 19th century. From the time the current border was set in 1848 until the 1930s, people moved back and forth across it without restrictions. But in 1965, Congress passed the Hart-Celler Act, putting a cap on Latin American immigration for the first time. The cap was low: just 20,000, although 50,000 workers were coming annually.<br /><br />After 1965, workers continued to come as they always had, and to be employed, as always. But now their presence was illegal. In 1986, Congress tried to fix the problem by offering amnesty to 2.3 million Mexicans who were living in the U.S. and by cracking down on employers who hired undocumented workers. But rather than ending the problem of undocumented workers, the new law exacerbated it by beginning the process of militarizing the border. Until then, migrants into the United States had been offset by an equal number leaving at the end of the season. Once the border became heavily guarded, Mexican migrants refused to take the chance of leaving.<br /><br />Then, in the 1990s, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) flooded Mexico with U.S. corn and drove Mexican farmers to find work in the American Southeast. This immigration boom had passed by 2007, when the number of undocumented Mexicans living in the United States began to decline as more Mexicans left the U.S. than came. <br /><br />In 2013 a large majority of Americans, both Republicans and Democrats, backed a bill to fix the disconnect caused by the 1965 law. In 2013, with a bipartisan vote of 68–32, the Senate passed a bill giving a 13-year pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, who would have to meet security requirements. It required employers to verify that they were hiring legal workers. It created a visa system for unskilled workers, and it got rid of preference for family migration in favor of skill-based migration. And it strengthened border security. It would have passed the House, but House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) refused to bring it up for a vote, aware that the issue of immigration would rally Republican voters. </p><p>But most of the immigrants coming over the southern border now are not Mexican migrants.<br /><br />Beginning around 2014, people began to flee “warlike levels of violence” in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, coming to the U.S. for asylum. This is legal, although most come illegally, taking their chances with smugglers who collect fees to protect migrants on the Mexican side of the border and to get them into the U.S.<br /><br />The Obama administration tried to deter migrants by expanding the detention of families, and it made significant investments in Central America in an attempt to stabilize the region by expanding economic development and promoting security. The Trump administration emphasized deterrence. It cut off support to Central American countries, worked with authoritarians to try to stop regional gangs, drastically limited the number of refugees the U.S. would admit, and—infamously—deliberately separated children from their parents to deter would-be asylum seekers.<br /><br />The number of migrants to the U.S. dropped throughout Trump’s years in office. The Trump administration gutted immigration staff and facilities and then cut off immigration during the pandemic under Title 42, a public health order. <br /><br />The Biden administration coincided with the easing of the pandemic and catastrophic storms in Central America, leading migration to jump, but the administration continued to turn migrants back under Title 42 and resumed working with Central American countries to stem the violence that is sparking people to flee. (In nine months, the Trump administration expelled more than 400,000 people under Title 42; in Biden’s first 18 months, his administration expelled 1.7 million people.) <br /><br />The Biden administration sought to end Title 42 last May, but a lawsuit by Republican states led a federal judge in Louisiana to keep the policy in place. People arriving at the U.S. border have the right to apply for asylum even under Title 42.<br /><br />There are a lot of moving pieces in the immigration debate: migrants need safety, the U.S. needs workers, our immigrant-processing systems are understaffed, and our laws are outdated. They need real solutions, not political stunts.</p><p>—</p><p>Notes:</p><p>https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/01/texas-national-guard-border-operation-lone-star-abbott/</p><p>https://www.boston.gov/departments/immigrant-advancement/immigrant-demographics#:~:text=Boston%20is%20a%20welcoming%20City,has%20more%20than%20690%2C000%20residents.</p><p>https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-09-15/marthas-vineyard-migrants-ron-desantis</p><p>https://www.urban.org/stateofdcimmigrants</p><p>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/09/16/desantis-geographic-conflict-2024-election/</p><p>https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/TX/POP010210</p><p>https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/sep/06/surprising-number-americans-believe-these-false-cl/</p><p>https://www.axios.com/2022/09/15/desantis-marthas-vineyard-migrants-biden</p><p>https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/18/immigration-border-republicans/</p><p>https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/us-unauthorized-immigrant-population-2017/</p><p>https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/doesnt-add-up/sharetoken/lkQnyIQXsVFR</p><p>https://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/immigration-bill-2013-senate-passes-093530</p><p>https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2014/08/04/the-real-reason-why-the-house-wont-pass-comprehensive-immigration-reform/</p><p>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/title-42-immigration-border-biden-covid-19-cdc/</p><p>https://www.rescue.org/article/it-legal-cross-us-border-seek-asylum</p><p>https://www.wcvb.com/article/venezuelan-migrants-flown-to-marthas-vineyard-being-offered-shelter-support-on-cape-cod/41244254#</p><p>Share</p><p></p>",

        "description": "<p>A friend, Stephen, said that as far as he could tell going on a walk was easily the best part of a dog's day. Maybe related, Billy Collins has a poem (or two) in which a dog does the speaking. The dog complains about how utterly boring it is to smell the same inside-the-house, already-pawed-by-the-owner smells hour after hour, day after day.</p>\n<p>Out the window just now, across the street in the grassy part of the ball field: a guy, his medium-sized dog, and a frisbee ring. Over on the street, two women joggers trotted by and the guy stopped looking at his dog for a moment. Then he turned his gaze back to his dog. The dog rolled over and started twisting and rubbing its back in the grass. No doubt breaking the leaves, stirring up a bit of fresh dirt, maybe crushing a few bugs. This turning and rubbing went on and on.</p>\n<p>I'm no expert, but that dog seemed very, very happy. All the guy was doing was observe him. At the end, popping up on, refreshed and vigorous and alive.</p>\n<p>My guess is that a back rub felt great, the length of which was chosen by the increasingly happy creature, and that this back rub took place in an invisible cloud of fascinating and utterly vivid fresh scents. Not pale, distant on-the-wind scents either. Right up there in the passages of your nose nearby scents. Just minted scents.</p>\n<p>Chosen freely by the dog, lasting as long as the dog wanted, a massage in an aroma cloud of fresh earth with its botanicals and biologicals. Doggy life is good, I'm guessing the dog thought there by the end.</p>\n<p>But just guessing. I don't really know that much about dogs.</p>",

        "title": "The Design of Audio Hijack 4",
        "link": "https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2022/09/09/the-design-of-audio-hijack-4/",
        "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Earlier this year, we shipped a massive upgrade to our flagship audio recorder, Audio Hijack. In addition to over 100 new features, Audio Hijack 4 also includes an overhauled design. Without a doubt, this was the biggest design project I’ve tackled as Rogue Amoeba’s designer, and probably in my entire career. Now that it’s out, I can take you behind the scenes and show you how we went from design goals and sketches to a polished app.</p>\n<p></p>\nMultiple Design Goals\n<p>When considering what to do for the new version, I worked out some clear design goals. Audio Hijack 3 was originally released in 2015, and it provided a great foundation. However, I knew there were places we could improve.</p>\n<p>Less Visual Clutter: While I loved design of Audio Hijack 3, fantastically executed by Rogue Amoeba’s previous designer Christa, I felt it could be made cleaner and simpler. Audio Hijack’s critical functionality is found in the custom setups called sessions, which users create to capture and manipulate audio. I wanted to make the rest of the interface deferential to each session’s audio grid.</p>\n<p>A More Functional Sessions List: Audio Hijack sessions are reusable and saved automatically. The list of saved sessions serves as the starting point for the app, and I wanted to improve that window by showing more details about sessions, as well as allowing the user to access basic controls without having to open them.</p>\n<p>Better Navigation: In the previous version of Audio Hijack, a session’s recordings and timers were kept in a separate window, rather than being closely tied to each session. I felt this was something I could make flow more logically.</p>\n<p>A Brighter, More Kinetic App: Audio Hijack 3 had a somewhat muted look, and I wanted to brighten the new version. From day one, we knew we’d be adding a new “Light” theme, but I also sought to add splashes of colour throughout the app. Our apps have also been trending towards having more and more movement, so it made sense to liven things up by adding more animation.</p>\n<p>New App Icon: Finally, I was excited to make a new icon for the new version.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at some of the ways we accomplished these various goals.</p>\nReducing Clutter and Adding Colour\n<p>The design of Audio Hijack 4 came together over a long period of time. The node-based UI introduced in version 3 was a huge success, so we knew we wanted to keep that general concept intact, while improving myriad facets of it. I dabbled with various ideas off and on for quite some time, while our amazing developer Grant worked on the underlying code and new features.</p>\nEarly Mocks\n<p>This is the very first mockup that I could find for version 4:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It shows just two blocks, but the connecting wire is surprisingly similar to what we ended up shipping. I knew right away that I wanted curved wires, though I was unsure if they would be worth the development effort. I also experimented with small icons under the block titles. This was quickly axed, however, because it led to too many cases where we needed to split block titles onto two lines.</p>\n<p>In this next mock, I tried having tiles snap directly together. It’s an idea I still like, but it hasn’t yet made it past this concept phase:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These first two mockups also show that the colour scheme was fluctuating wildly. Both contained Audio Hijack’s signature oranges and blues, but the feel wasn’t figured out yet.</p>\nGetting There\n<p>Over time, my mockups moved closer to the app’s final form, and contained more and more of the eventual interface, as seen in the following mock:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This particular mockup is almost a halfway point between versions 3 and 4. The colours temporarily swung back towards version 3’s darker hues and the connecting wires have reverted back to straight. However, the sidebar on the right looks similar to the final product, with a reduction of the more ornate elements of the old UI.</p>\n<p><br />\nLeft: Version 3; Right: Version 4</p>\n<p>The above screenshots zoom in on the shipping sidebars for version 3 and version 4. You can see the boxes around each group of blocks were removed, icons were enlarged, and the text was given more space. None of these were major changes, but together, they served to simplify the interface as a whole.</p>\n<p>In this last mock, the app really started to look like what we eventually shipped, complete with the new “Light” theme:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This shot shows several ways we simplified the UI. The bottom bar in particular is a lot less complicated, and no longer extends all the way across the window. We also replaced multiple disparate views with tabs in the sidebar – more on that below. Even those great curved wires feel cleaner visually.</p>\nP3 Colours\n<p>One noticeable change between these early mocks and the shipping version is the implementation of brighter colours. The blues and oranges in Audio Hijack 4 dip into the territory of ‘P3’ colours, which display a little more vividly on newer monitors. Macs have shipped with P3 colour support for quite a few years, but this is the first time we felt it worth using throughout a whole app’s UI.</p>\n<p><br />\n<br />An approximation of the difference between standard sRGB color and brighter, more intense P3 colour.</p>\n<p>You can only see P3 colour on a P3 monitor, but the above image gives an approximation of the relative difference. It’s subtle, but the non-P3 gradient on the bottom is less bright and dynamic than the P3 gradient on the top. Using the P3 colour system, we were able to make colours more intense than we could before.</p>\n<p>To avoid overwhelming your eyes, these brighter colours are used sparingly, generally when we want to draw your attention. In our very basic array of colours, we use a bright orange to denote when something is “live”, and this extra pop of P3 intensity for the orange makes this important status just a little more eye-catching and harder to miss.</p>\nEnhanced Navigation via a More Powerful Session Sidebar\n<p>One of my biggest frustrations with Audio Hijack 3 was the navigational architecture of the app, which divided much of the content across different windows. For example, after you made a recording with a session, you then needed to open the Home window’s “Recordings” tab to access your audio. There, the recording was shown in a list with other sessions and their recordings. Schedules suffered from similar issues. It all worked, but the recordings and schedules for a session were not closely tied to the session itself, and I often found myself taking a few seconds to try and remember where to find them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To improve this, we built out a much more powerful sidebar for the session window, one which incorporates these related items. The sidebar is already literally attached to the session, and thanks to the power of tabs, it now holds that session’s recordings, schedules, and even the newly-added scripting features. Sessions are now fully self-contained, and it works wonderfully.</p>\nAn Improved Session List\n<p>Another element of the UI we wanted to improve was the list of reusable sessions. The previous Home window showed a rudimentary grid of saved sessions, with no indication of what was running.</p>\n<p>The new session list in action, showing a quick summary of each session as well as which are active or inactive.</p>\n<p>For Audio Hijack 4, we wanted to make the session list an active part of the interface. It’s now possible to start or stop a session, view and adjust the Auto Run setting, quickly scan sources, check audio levels, and see status. The new Session List window is now a much more powerful starting point for using the app. It’s also easily expanded-upon, and in the future, we’re planning to add even more.</p>\nAnimations Abound\n<p>Audio Hijack 4 is a kinetic app, with subtle animations to aid in understanding. The tiles and wires move, meters bounce, and status icons pulsate to show when things are in action. I’m proud of all these animations, but there are two particular bits I want to call out.</p>\n<p>First up are the amazing animations on the connecting wires. While the previous version’s wires could occasionally look somewhat soft, Audio Hijack 4’s wires are all drawn with vectors, so they’re super sharp. They’re also beautifully curved and feel incredibly snappy as you drag blocks around.</p>\n<p>Your browser doesn’t support the video tag. Click to download and watch in another app.</p>\n<p>You may not have noticed, but these wires actually morph shape. When a device isn’t running, the wire is made of arrows showing the direction audio will flow. When you hit ‘Run’, however, each arrow changes into a pill shape, as it starts moving and bouncing to represent the audio levels of the sound passing through that wire. Hit ‘Stop’ and every single blip on the wire morphs back into an arrow.</p>\n<p>My other favorite animations are the various status badges which show what a given session is doing. Much like a photo on a cereal box, here they’ve been enlarged to show texture (I’ve also slowed them down):</p>\n<p>Your browser doesn’t support the video tag. Click to download and watch in another app. Your browser doesn’t support the video tag. Click to download and watch in another app.</p>\n<p>In app, these animations are infinitely-looping, vector-based, and very cool.</p>\nMarketing Too\n<p>Animations also found their way into the app’s product marketing. Animated versions of the interface can be found on the main product marketing page for Audio Hijack, as well as the welcome window we show on first launch. Using still images just didn’t do justice to the dynamic app we’ve made. Getting these various videos working required a decent amount of troubleshooting, and a bit more file bandwidth. The extra work was well worth it, however, to show off the app in motion.</p>\nA New App Icon\n<p>One final thing I’d like to discuss is Audio Hijack’s new icon. App icons serve as the most recognizable symbol for a product, and Audio Hijack 4’s icon took a long time to nail down. It seems almost nothing is as prone to endless discussion and debate as icons.</p>\n<p>Audio Hijack 3’s bottle icon was attractive and well drawn, but the “audio in a bottle” metaphor was a bit oblique. I did briefly try to modernize the bottle concept with my own take on it:</p>\n<p><br />The original bottle icon on the left, with my sketch of a refresh on the right.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, though, this never left the early sketch stages. I next tried using some abstract shapes as a base. I still love many of the designs I created. This page of my sketchbook is particularly pleasing:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Those sketches eventually led to more refined mockups, like this one:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was very into both abstract patterns and this particular colour gradient, which does partly mirror the orange and blues of the app’s UI. However, while this waveform-inspired look was tangentially related to audio, it lacked a strong visual link to the rest of the app.</p>\n<p>So it was that the slanted wavy pattern was tilted to vertical and changed to orange on a darker background, to match the meters inside the app. Finally, I added a physical microphone to more clearly communicate the concept of ‘audio’.</p>\n<p>Many of us inside Rogue Amoeba lament the recent “flattening” of app icons on the Mac, and the attendant loss of personality. While I did feel we needed to somewhat conform to the new tile design paradigm, I wanted to overlay a bit of 3D to help differentiate the shape (see also: SoundSource).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Above is my first rendition of the concept with a 3D microphone. This icon is a lot more visually tied to the actual app it represents. Once I got here, we were close, though there was still plenty of tweaking and refining. Perhaps most interestingly, the final icon actually features two small Easter eggs: the waveform is based on a recording of me saying the word “Hijack”, and the mic reads RA 2002, representing the year Rogue Amoeba was founded1. Now you know!</p>\nConclusion\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this peek at the design process for Audio Hijack 4. I was fortunate to work alongside a development team that was happy to spend time creating a wonderfully dynamic interface, one which shows off the useful new features and the rock-solid backend. I’m very pleased with how it all turned out.</p>\n<p>However, I’ve only scratched the surface of all the new things you’ll see in Audio Hijack 4. I didn’t even mention major new features like manual pipeline connections or the new Global window. If you’ve used Audio Hijack before, be sure to give the “What’s New” page a look. Of course, if you’ve never used Audio Hijack, you ought to check out Audio Hijack 4 right here.</p>\n\n<p>Footnotes:</p>\n\n\n<p>Hey, that was 20 years ago! What a pleasingly round number. I doubt it will come up again anytime soon.↩︎</p>",

        "description": "<p>\nI’ve long imagined a tool that would enable a teacher to help students learn how to write and edit. In Thoughts in motion I explored what might be possible in Federated Wiki, a writing tool that keeps version history for each paragraph. I thought it could be extended to enable the kind of didactic editing I have in mind, but never found a way forward.</p>\n<p>\nIn How to write a press release I tried bending Google Docs to this purpose. To narrate the process of editing a press release, I dropped a sample release into a GDoc and captured a series of edits as named versions. Then I captured the versions as screenshots and combined them with narration, so the reader of the blog post can see each edit as a color-coded diff with an explanation.</p>\n<p>\nThe key enabler is GDoc’s File -&gt; Version history -&gt; Name current version, along with File -&gt; See version history‘s click-driven navigation of the set of diffs. It’s easy to capture a sequence of editing steps that way. </p>\n<p>\nBut it’s much harder to present those steps as I do in the post. That required me to make, name, and organize a set of images, then link them to chunks of narration. It’s tedious work. And if you want to build something like this for students, that’s work you shouldn’t be doing. You just want to do the edits, narrate them, and share the result.</p>\n<p>\nThis week I tried a different approach when editing a document written by a colleague. Again the goal was not only to produce an edited version, but also to narrate the edits in a didactic way. In this case I tried bending GitHub to my purpose. I put the original doc in a repository, made step-by-step edits in a branch, and created a pull request. We were then able to review the pull request, step through the changes, and review each as a color-coded diff with an explanation. No screenshots had to be made, named, organized, or linked to the narration. I could focus all my attention on doing and narrating the edits. Perfect!</p>\n<p>\nWell, perfect for someone like me who uses GitHub every day. If that’s not you, could this technique possibly work?</p>\n<p>\nIn GitHub for the rest of us I argued that GitHub’s superpowers could serve everyone, not just programmers. In retrospect I felt that I’d overstated the case. GitHub was, and remains, a tool that’s deeply optimized for programmers who create and review versioned source code. Other uses are possible, but awkward. </p>\n<p>\nAs an experiment, though, let’s explore how awkward it would be to recreate my Google Docs example in GitHub. I will assume that you aren’t a programmer, have never used GitHub, and don’t know (or want to know) anything about branches or commits or pull requests. But you would like to be able to create a presentation that walks a learner though a sequence of edits, with step-by-step narration and color-coded diffs. At the end of this tutorial you’ll know how to do that. The method isn’t as straightforward as I wish it were. But I’ll describe it carefully, so you can try it for yourself and decide whether it’s practical.</p>\n<p>\nHere’s the final result of the technique I’ll describe.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIf you want to replicate that, and don’t already have a GitHub account, create one now and log in.</p>\n<p>\nReady to go? OK, let’s get started.</p>\nStep 1: Create a repository\n<p>\nClick the + button in the top right corner, then click New repository.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHere’s the next screen. All you must do here is name the repository, e.g. editing-step-by-step, then click Create repository. I’ve ticked the Add a README file box, and chosen the Apache 2.0 license, but you could leave the defaults — box unchecked, license None — as neither matters for our purpose here.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nStep 2: Create a new file\n<p>\nOn your GitHub home page, click the Repositories tab. Your new repo shows up first. Click its link to open it, then click the Add file dropdown and choose Create new file. Here’s where you land.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nStep 3: Add the original text, create a new branch, commit the change, and create a pull request\n<p>\nWhat happens on the next screen is bewildering, but I will spare you the details because I’m assuming you don’t want to know about branches or commits or pull requests, you just want to build the kind of presentation I’ve promised you can. So, just follow this recipe.</p>\n\nName the file (e.g. sample-press-release.txt\nCopy/paste the text of the document into the edit box\nSelect Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request\nName the branch (e.g. edits)\nClick Propose new file\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOn the next screen, title the pull request (e.g. edit the press release) and click Create pull request.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nStep 4: Visit the new branch and begin editing\n<p>\nOn the home page of your repo, use the main dropdown to open the list of branches. There are now two: main and edits. Select edits</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHere’s the next screen. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nClick the name of the document you created (e.g. sample-press-release.txt to open it.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nClick the pencil icon’s dropdown, and select Edit this file.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMake and preview your first edit. Here, that’s my initial rewrite of the headline. I’ve written a title for the commit (Step 1: revise headline), and I’ve added a detailed explanation in the box below the title. You can see the color-coded diff above, and the rationale for the change below. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nClick Commit changes, and you’re back in the editor ready to make the next change.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nStep 5: Visit the pull request to review the change\n<p>On your repo’s home page (e.g. https://github.com/judell/editing-step-by-step), click the Pull requests button. You’ll land here.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nClick the name of the pull request (e.g. edit the press release) to open it. In the rightmost column you’ll see links with alphanumeric labels. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nClick the first one of those to land here.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is the first commit, the one that added the original text. Now click Next to review the first change.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis, finally, is the effect we want to create: a granular edit, with an explanation and a color-coded diff, encapsulated in a link that you can give to a learner who can then click Next to step through a series of narrated edits.</p>\nLather, rinse, repeat\n<p>\nTo continue building the presentation, repeat Step 4 (above) once per edit. I’m doing that now.</p>\n<p>\n… time passes …</p>\n<p>\nOK, done. Here’s the final edited copy. To step through the edits, start here and use the Next button to advance step-by-step.</p>\n<p>\nIf this were a software project you’d merge the edits branch into the main branch and close the pull request. But you don’t need to worry about any of that. The edits branch, with its open pull request, is the final product, and the link to the first commit in the pull request is how you make it available to a learner who wants to review the presentation.</p>\n<p>\nGitHub enables what I’ve shown here by wrapping the byzantine complexity of the underlying tool, Git, in a much friendlier interface. But what’s friendly to a programmer is still pretty overwhelming for an English teacher. I still envision another layer of packaging that would make this technique simpler for teachers and learners focused on the craft of writing and editing. Meanwhile, though, it’s possible to use GitHub to achieve a compelling result. Is it practical? That’s not for me to say, I’m way past being able to see this stuff through the eyes of a beginner. But if that’s you, and you’re motivated to give this a try, I would love to know whether you’re able to follow this recipe, and if so whether you think it could help you to help learners become better writers and editors.</p>",

        "description": "Alto.com is a wonderful pharmacy that offers same day delivery. I have nothing but great things to say about them.<br /><br />But they're following a pattern I'm seeing far too often these days. They're trying to track everything, and asking people to attribute \"experience\" to things that are mere, routine happenings. Most things just don't need to be rated.<br /><br />For example, after a recent delivery, I got this text message:<br /><br />\n\n\n\n<br /><br />They ask me to rate my \"experience\". Thing is, I didn't have an experience. The delivery person just left the package by the mailbox and I grabbed it when I got home. And what does it mean to even rate a delivery like this? It showed up, it was correct... Is that a 5-star experience? Would it only be worth 3 stars if the package was lying on the ground instead of propped up against the wall? There isn't enough there there to even establish a value.<br /><br />If you're going to ask anything, a more apt question might be \"Did the correct prescription show up on time?\" Then I can answer yes or no. But rate the experience? And every time I get a prescription, it's the same question about the experience.<br /><br />I know what they're getting at, and I'm probably belaboring the point, but I'm seeing this everywhere and I can't help but think it's generating data that's incompatible with the actual situation. Being asked to rate minutia with a 10-point scale, and ascribe depth of an experience to something that's effectively flat and one dimensional, is overshooting the goal.<br /><br />-Jason<br />",

        "description": "<p>Millions of miles away on Mars, in a barren crater just north of the equator, a rover is wandering around, carrying a gold-coated gadget the size of a toaster. The machine inhales the Martian air and strips away contaminants. It splits the atmospheric gas into constituent parts, takes what it needs, and then reassembles that blend to create something that is in very short supply on Mars: oxygen. Real, breathable oxygen, the kind you took in as you read these sentences.</p><p>After a bit of analysis, the machine puffs out the oxygen, harmlessly releasing the molecules into the Martian environment. The act makes this very sophisticated toaster, situated in the belly of NASA’s Perseverance rover, the closest thing to a small tree on Mars.</p><p>And according to the researchers behind the little machine, it’s a pretty good tree. Every time they’ve run it, the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment—MOXIE, for short—has successfully converted Martian air, which is almost entirely made of carbon dioxide, into oxygen gas. “We’re not far from being able to produce oxygen at the rate that would sustain a human being,” Michael Hecht, a planetary scientist at MIT’s Haystack Observatory who leads the project, told me. “A small dog would be just fine at the rate that we produce.”</p><p>[Read: What would a dog do on Mars?]</p><p>MOXIE is a clever chemistry experiment. It is also a remarkable event in the history of space exploration. If human beings want to build a long-term home on Mars, they’ll have to make use of the planet’s natural resources instead of lugging everything they need all the way from Earth. “We have to be able to live off the land,” Jennifer Heldmann, a NASA scientist who works in this futuristic field—known as in situ resource utilization—told me. “This is the first time that we’ve been able to test and demonstrate the technology to do that.”</p><p>And oxygen is wonderfully versatile. Not only would it sustain humans on a planet that their lungs weren’t designed for, but it could also be combined with other compounds to produce rocket fuel so that they could return to Earth. On Mars, we’re the aliens. We’d need to invent all kinds of stuff to give future astronauts a chance to survive there, let alone live comfortably. It is almost sci-fi-ish to think about, but by tinkering with Mars’s atmosphere, we—as in humankind—have managed to figure out at least one piece of that endeavor.</p><p>The MOXIE experiment whirred into action in February of last year, after Perseverance touched down and started working toward its prime mission: collecting rocky samples that could contain the tiny imprints of long-dead Martian life. MOXIE had its own work cut out for it. The Martian atmosphere is so thin that, compared with our own, it’s almost a vacuum. “I like to say we’re making oxygen out of thin air,” Hecht said. “If you were a Martian, you would think that those of us on Earth are fish swimming around in a thick soup of atmosphere.”</p><p>[Read: We’ve never seen Mars quite like this]</p><p>Mars also experiences far more dramatic shifts in its atmospheric conditions. Daytime and nighttime temperatures can vary by about 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius). The air shifts as well, thinning out during the warm days and becoming denser during the cold nights. Swings in air pressure occur seasonally, too. During Martian winters, some of the atmosphere condenses into frost and settles over the poles, reducing the air pressure across the rest of the planet. During Martian summers, air pressure ticks up. All of these factors influence the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere—MOXIE’s main snack.</p><p>To see how MOXIE would fare, engineers powered up the instrument during different times of day and different seasons. They found that “the most difficult time to collect carbon dioxide is in the middle of the day, in the middle of the winter, when it’s both warm and the pressure is low,” Hecht said. “And the easiest time is the middle of the night in the middle of the summer, when the pressure is high and the temperature is low.” But during every run, the machine worked, spending an hour churning out oxygen.</p><p>The team has yet to deploy MOXIE during dawn or dusk, though, when “the density of the air is changing, and the temperature is changing rapidly,” Hecht said. Engineers are concerned that the sudden shift in the presence of carbon dioxide could damage the instrument as it draws the gas in. Hecht says they’ll do some testing with a lab version of MOXIE on Earth first, but they’re confident that they can get their little lunch box to work under these conditions, too.</p><p>[Read: Mars’s soundscape is strangely beautiful]</p><p>Other groups of scientists are thinking about how to make oxygen factories for future Mars missions; one team recently devised a method for generating oxygen from carbon dioxide with the help of plasma. And other researchers are thinking deeply about how to use additional resources on Mars, such as the ice deposits just below the planet’s surface. Future astronauts could mine the frozen water and purify it for everyday use. They could also steal the water’s hydrogen molecules and put them toward the work of getting home. “You can make methane, which is a rocket propellant,” Julie Kleinhenz, a NASA research engineer who studies in situ resource utilization and is not involved with the MOXIE project, told me. “You could fully refuel an ascent vehicle with methane and oxygen just by using resources on Mars, through processes that are pretty well understood.” Some basic items, such as spacesuits and toilets, will have to come over from here. But if you can make something on Mars, you can reduce the heavy baggage that makes it more difficult to blast off from Earth.</p><p>The team behind MOXIE imagines a future in which a scaled-up version, capable of doing the work of hundreds of trees, hums away on the surface of Mars, working around the clock. The factory would be launched ahead of a human mission, so that there would be plenty of oxygen reserves by the time astronauts arrive. That future is still many years away; NASA says the earliest that it could land astronauts on the red planet is sometime in the early 2040s. Elon Musk wants to go much earlier than that with SpaceX, but even the space billionaire will face the same constraints that would make a Mars trip difficult (funding, physics, the cosmic radiation between here and there). A mega-size MOXIE would be just one item on a very long packing list. But MOXIE has a certain concreteness to it that feels thrilling even now. It is the kind of detail that makes a human base on Mars seem a tiny bit more realistic. Imagine, decades from now, an engineer sitting at a console, inhaling air derived from an alien atmosphere, and telling one of her staff: “Hey, Steve, we’re getting some weird MOXIE readings—can you go check it out?”</p>",

No doubt virtual and extended reality have a role to play in education. I've flown in a full-size virtual helocopter and performed VR neurosurgery and am convinced. But it's one thing to name yourself 'Multiverse' and quite another to deliver on what that word suggests. Some companies labeling themselves 'Multiverse' are getting far ahead of themselves, this being one.</p>\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

Many of us are feeling this way, and so are companies: In a downturn, cutting unnecessary expenses is more important than ever. Is this why SaaS management solutions have become ubiquitous? Let’s explore. — Anna</p>\nFighting SaaS sprawl\n<p>“SaaS sprawl is a natural consequence of the SaaS revolution,” TechCrunch contributors Mark Settle and Tomer Y. Avni wrote in a guest column last November. Paying for and managing myriad SaaS subscriptions may be natural, but it is still a headache for companies, which likely explains why solutions helping them manage this pain point are quite popular among investors.</p>\n\n<p>The consequences of SaaS sprawl: A real-world study</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just this week, British SaaS management company Cledara announced a $20 million Series A round of funding, TechCrunch’s Paul Sawers reported. This follows earlier pre-seed and seed rounds, bringing the startup’s total funding to date to some $24 million.</p>\n<p>As weird as it feels to write this, $20 million is no longer a ton of money in our strange little world. But Cledara’s Series A round was closed in a downturn. And it’s the SaaS management category as a whole that VCs are betting on: Several Cledara competitors have also raised noteworthy amounts of venture capital over the last couple of years.</p>\n<p></p><p>No money for shelfware by Anna Heim originally published on TechCrunch</p>",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/how-to-sideload-android-apps-chromeos",
        "description": "<p>Sometimes, an Android app that you want to install on your Chromebook may simply not be available on the Google Play Store. This could be either because it’s incompatible, or because the app’s developer has tagged it as such due to the experience on your device not being exactly how they prefer to present it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While admirable, you may just want the darn thing to be installed so you can use it – bugs and all. Today, I’m going to show you how you can install apps from outside of the Play Store on your Chromebook without needing to switch into developer mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick note on this though – if you do this, you’re potentially putting yourself at risk with bad actor app packages, so please proceed with caution and only install apps you know from developers you trust! Okay, let’s continue.</p>\n\n\n\nWhat you’ll need\n\n\n\n<p>To get started, you’ll need your Chromebook (of course), and you also need to have enabled Linux on your device. You can do that by following our quick tutorial. Once you’re up and running with that, then just go and grab whatever app you want to install. We recommend going exclusively to APK Mirror since all of their uploads have been scanned and approved for safety. However, if you’re trying to install Fortnite or something, you can download other apps from their source website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an incredibly useful thing to know as a Chromebook owner who’s looking to take advantage of different apps on your laptop, especially as many game developers simply don’t port their experiences to larger screens. We’re lookin’ at you, Apex Legends! Unfortunately, I did try to install Apex, and it still wouldn’t run because the devs have forced the game to check for Play Store integration, so your mileage may vary.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up Android Debugging\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so you’ve set up Linux support and you also have your app to install. First thing’s first, you’re going to want to go into the Files app and rename it to something simple. Be sure to leave the “.apk” at the end of it as that’s the extension. Then, drag and drop that file to the left-hand sidebar of the Files app into the “Linux Files” folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go into the Settings app on your Chromebook and click the “Linux (Beta)” section. Next, click “Develop Android apps” and press the blue button that shows on the pop-up dialogue box. It should say “Restart and continue”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your device will reboot, and after it does, you’ll see the following screen confirming whether or not you want to “Enable ADB debugging”. This is usually meant for developers who want to locally install early test versions of their apps before distributing them to the masses, but we’re going to use it to forcefully install apps for our own needs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you’ll tap the blue “Confirm” button to continue. Even though you’ll have a red message at the bottom of your login screen stating that “This device may contain apps that haven’t been verified by Google”, you can sign in as usual before we move on. Again, only install apps you know from developers you trust and this won’t be a problem!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now for the technical part. Open the “Terminal” app from your Chromebook launcher and type in “sudo apt install adb“. Hit the enter key on your keyboard and wait. You may be prompted to confirm ADB’s installation by typing the “Y” key and hitting enter again.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing you’ll type in after it’s done installing ADB is “adb connect arc“. This will connect you to the Android debugging tool so you can tell it to install your .apk file that’s currently laying in wait in your Linux files folder of the Files app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should get a quick pop-up asking you if you want to “Allow USB debugging”, and you’ll obviously say “OK”. Here’s the final step – back in the Terminal app, type in the following, replacing what’s in brackets with the name of your app that’s in your Linux files (don’t include the brackets either).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>adb install [name of your app].apk</p>Type this for ARM processor devices\n\n\n\n<p>adb -s emulator-5554 install [name of your app].apk</p>Type this for Intel or AMD processors\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it! You should get a message stating that your app is being installed. Once it’s finished, you’ll find the app freshly installed with its icon in your Chromebook’s launcher. I’d love to hear in the comments what app you needed to or decided to install and whether or not it had Play Store protection and wouldn’t run due to needing a key. Again, Apex Legends clearly didn’t work for us, but I imagine many others will work just fine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just want the steps!</p><p>1. Enable Linux support on your Chromebook<br />2. Download whichever app (APK) file you would like to install<br />3. Open the Files app and rename the app file (leave “.apk” at the end!)<br />4. Drag and drop the app file into “Linux files“<br />5. Open the Settings app and navigate to “Developers“<br />6. Click “Linux Development Environment”<br />7. Select “Develop Android apps”<br />8. Let your Chromebook restart and allow ADB debugging<br />9. Log back in and open the “Terminal” app<br />10. Type “sudo apt install adb” and hit enter<br />11. If asked, type “Y” and hit enter to confirm installation<br />12. Type “adb connect arc” and hit enter<br />13. Type “adb install [name of your app].apk“<br />14. If that doesn’t work, type “adb -s emulator-5554 install [name of your app].apk“<br />14. Open your new app from your Chromebook launcher!</p>\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) told a former White House aide that he was seeking a preemptive pardon from President Donald Trump regarding an investigation in which he is a target, the Washington Post reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The testimony is the first indication that Gaetz was specifically seeking a pardon for his own exposure related to the Justice Department inquiry into whether he violated sex trafficking laws. His public posture in the final months of the Trump administration was much less specific, repeatedly calling for broad preemptive pardons to fend off possible Democratic investigations.”</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Greg Fiume/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Trevor Rogers and Erick Fedde will start Saturday’s Marlins vs. Nationals game at Nationals Park. Full lineups and game notes in here.</p> <p>Welcome to Saturday’s Marlins (59-86, -106 RD) vs. Nationals (50-94, -210 RD) game thread. Friday’s loss was as embarrassing as any the Marlins have had this season, and that’s saying something.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Use this Fish Picks link prior to every Marlins series to submit your predictions. The ninth inning of the contest has just begun and it runs through October 3. </p>\n\n<p>Marlins Game Notes</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Marlins Starting Lineup</p>\n\n2B Charles Leblanc (104 wRC+ this season, 80 wRC+ over last 30 days)\nSS Joey Wendle (87, 97) \nRF Brian Anderson (97, 81) \nDH Nick Fortes (105, 68) \nCF JJ Bleday (82, 61)\nC Jacob Stallings (69, 79) \n3B Jordan Groshans (195, 195) \nLF Jerar Encarnacion (47, 45)\n1B Lewin Díaz (42, 56)\n\n<p>LHP Trevor Rogers (77 ERA+ this season, career 103 ERA+) </p>\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n      Rogers’ 2022 pitch distribution and Statcast percentile rankings\n  \n<p></p>\n<p>Lineup Changes from Previous Game: Encarnación, Leblanc and Stallings in, Jon Berti, Bryan De La Cruz and Miguel Rojas out; Wendle switches from 2B to SS, Fortes switches from C to DH</p>\n<p>Additional Notes: Groshans is starting for the fifth straight game to begin his MLB career...Rogers has been paired with Stallings in every start since returning from the injured list. He’s been working efficiently in those outings, averaging barely 14 pitches per inning.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nationals Starting Lineup</p>\n\nRF Lane Thomas (101, 150) \nLF Alex Call (99, 124) \n1B Joey Meneses (145, 123) \nDH Luke Voit (109, 105) \n3B Ildemaro Vargas (115, 135)\n2B Luis García (98, 105)\nC Riley Adams (72, 69)\nCF Victor Robles (66, 24)\nSS CJ Abrams (64, 58)\n\n<p>RHP Erick Fedde (75 ERA+ this season, career 80 ERA+) </p>\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n      Fedde’s 2022 pitch distribution and Statcast percentile rankings\n  \n<p></p>\n<p>Notes: For as bad as the Marlins offense has struggled in recent years, it’s still baffling that they’ve been owned so thoroughly by a pitcher of Fedde’s ilk. His 1.86 earned run average and 28.3% strikeout rate in nine career starts against the Fish are way out of line with his career norms...You’ve probably heard part of Meneses’ backstory by now. The unheralded 30-year-old finally got his shot at the majors in the aftermath of the Juan Soto trade and he has proceeded to emerge as a Soto-like run producer. Meneses has been especially unstoppable against left-handers like Rogers, slashing .411/.450/.786 in 60 plate appearances with the platoon advantage.</p>\n\nHow to Watch/Listen/Follow\n<p>First pitch is scheduled for 4:05 p.m. ET. Watch on Bally Sports Florida or listen to the radio broadcast on Fox Sports 940 Miami.

        "description": "A design by one of Elizabeth II’s favourite photographers is mine for less than the price of a train ticket<p>The week before the Queen died, I bought a tiny drawing by Cecil Beaton: a design for a yellow headdress. It’s undated, and perhaps it’s not very distinguished, though Beaton won an Oscar for the costumes he created for Gigi and My Fair Lady. But these things hardly matter to me. I love its colours – shades of green-yellow, like the wings of a goldfinch – and it cost me no more than the price of a return ticket to Manchester (a rarefied, but highly damning indictment of our railway companies, I feel).</p><p>What timing, though. Beaton was one of the Queen’s favourite photographers, a relationship that began when she was 16 – she was in pink taffeta, he was aiming to shoot her “in the manner of Gainsborough” – and which might be said to have reached its climax when he was chosen to take the official pictures at the coronation, an event for which he famously arrived hung over, a supply of sandwiches stashed inside his top hat.</p> Continue reading...",

Ureña’s last outing against the Diamondbacks resulted in five strikeouts and only one earned run and he ended up with a no-decision. His performance against Cincinnati right before that was less than ideal, though. He gave up six earned runs on five hits and had only one strikeout. </p>\n<p>The Cubs will call on the rookie, Hayden Wesneski (1-1, 3.12 ERA). Wesneski was a part of the Yankees minor league system until he was traded to the Cubs for Scott Effross. His debut was on September 6 against Cincinnati and has pitched in one other game against San Francisco. </p>\n<p>Wesneski’s debut against Cincinnati went well for the rookie. He pitched five complete innings giving up only two hits, no earned runs. In that game he had an impressive eight strikeouts. His outing against the Giants was not quite as clean. He pitched 3 2⁄3 innings and gave up three earned runs on four hits, two of which were home runs. </p>\n<p>The Rockies will need to find a way to jump on the rookie early. Hopefully they’re able to find hits instead of strikeouts. And Ureña needs to channel the quality performance we saw against the Diamondbacks. </p>\n<p>On a fun note, today the Rockies’ rookies had their annual “get coffee and donuts in full uniform” excursion in Wrigleyville. </p>\n\n\n<p>Annual Rockies Rookie coffee run in Wrigleyville✅ pic.twitter.com/RUwWVSK47h</p>— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The best rookie tradition… rookies walk to go and get coffee/donuts for the whole clubhouse in full uniform before the game   pic.twitter.com/fUq5SxIJwN</p>— Kelsey Wingert-Linch (@KelsWingert) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>First Pitch: 12:20 PM MDT</p>\n<p>TV: AT&amp;T Sports Net Rocky Mountain; MLB.tv</p>\n<p>Radio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM; KNRV 1150 (Spanish)</p>\n<p>Lineups:</p>\n\n\n<p>Lineups: pic.twitter.com/S0sYzn1QGG</p>— Purple Row (@PurpleRow) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Here is today's #Cubs starting lineup against the Rockies. pic.twitter.com/F7dsgcFj85</p>— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

Pratto was hitting just .184/.271/.386 with seven home runs in 49 games with a 36 percent strikeout rate. </p>\n<p>The 23-year-old had been struggling in particular as of late, going just 4-for-39 (.103) in the month of September, striking out 40 percent of the time. Still, Pratto was providing solid defense at first base, and his 10.4 percent walk rate is fourth-best on the team. Pratto was sent to Triple-A Omaha, who will play until September 28. </p>\n<p>The Royals made the move to activate Edward Olivares, who had been out since July 22 with a quad strain. Injuries have robbed Olivares of most of this season, and he has appeared in just 36 games with the Royals, hitting .303/.358/.434 with three home runs. </p>\n<p>The Royals demoted Pratto instead of cutting ties with Ryan O’Hearn, who continues to occupy a roster spot despite hitting .221/.273/.295 in 132 plate appearances. </p>\n<p>Ryan O’Hearn is constant.</p>\n<p>Ryan O’Hearn is eternal.</p>\n<p>Ryan O’Hearn is forever.</p>",

For storm information specific to your area outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK ---------------------- Data from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that Fiona's center has re-formed farther east. At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Fiona was located near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 63.5 West. Fiona is moving toward the west near 8 mph (13 km/h). A west-northwestward motion at a similar forward speed is expected to begin later today, followed by a turn toward the northwest by Sunday evening. On the forecast track, the center of Fiona is expected to move near or south of the Virgin Islands this evening, approach Puerto Rico tonight, and move near or over Puerto Rico Sunday night. Fiona should then move near the Dominican Republic on Monday. Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and Fiona is expected to become a hurricane by Sunday or Sunday night while moving near Puerto Rico. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km) from the center. Data from the reconnaissance aircraft indicate that the minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND ---------------------- Key messages for Tropical Storm Fiona can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT2.shtml. WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected on Puerto Rico Sunday and Sunday night and are possible in the U.S. Virgin Islands tonight. Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in the Dominican Republic Sunday night and Monday. Tropical storm conditions will continue across portions of the Leeward Islands within the warning area through this afternoon. Tropical storm conditions will reach the U.S. and British Virgin Islands this afternoon, spread westward across Puerto Rico tonight, and reach portions of the Dominican Republic Sunday night. Tropical storm conditions are possible across the watch area in the Dominican Republic Sunday night. RAINFALL: Fiona is forecast to produce the following rainfall: Leeward Islands and Northern Windward Islands: Additional 2 to 4 inches. British and U.S. Virgin Islands: 4 to 6 inches with local maximum of 10 inches possible. Puerto Rico: 12 to 16 inches with local maximum of 20 inches possible, particularly across eastern and southern Puerto Rico. Dominican Republic: 4 to 8 inches with local maximum of 12 inches possible, particularly on the far eastern coast. Haiti: 1 to 3 inches with isolated maximum totals of 4 inches. Turks and Caicos: 4 to 6 inches. These rains are likely to produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, particularly southern and eastern Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic. STORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas in areas of onshore winds if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide... Southern coast of Puerto Rico...1 to 3 ft Vieques and Culebra...1 to 3 ft U.S. Virgin Islands...1 to 2 ft Localized coastal flooding is also possible elsewhere in Puerto Rico. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office. Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore winds in the Dominican Republic. SURF: Swells generated by Fiona are affecting the Leeward Islands, the northern Windward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas. These conditions could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.</p><p>Here’s the forecast track of Fiona, including the cone of uncertainty for the path of Fiona’s center:</p>Forecast track of FionaNWS National Hurricane Center<p>The National Hurricane Center will issue several Fiona updates today and through the coming days.</p><p>Weather nugget</p><p>So far this year, precipitation at International Falls is running one foot above normal. Precipitation is rainfall plus the water content of the snow that fell earlier this year. Duluth precipitation is running 2.11 inches above normal, and Twin Cities precipitation (measured at MSP airport) is 6.42 inches below normal so far this year.</p><p>Programming note</p><p>You can hear my live weather updates on MPR News at 7:35 a.m., 9:35 a.m. and 4:39 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.</p>",

But typically, it’s TikTok that’s being copied from, not the one doing the copying. That changed this week, however, when the company announced it was launching a fairly shameless BeReal clone in its app, which it calls “TikTok Now.”</p>\n<p>Similar to the hot Gen Z app BeReal, TikTok Now will prompt its U.S. users to take a front and back camera photo or 10-second video at a random time every day, which is then shared with friends in a new section labeled “Now” in the app’s main navigation — quite a prominent position for an unoriginal feature.</p>\n\n<p>TikTok just launched a BeReal clone called TikTok Now</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The addition initially seems like an odd one for TikTok, given its primary focus is on video entertainment, not friendship-focused social networking, which is what BeReal’s all about. But we have seen some signs in recent months that TikTok’s ambitions are aimed at taking on both areas. The company has been pushing more features designed to connect its users with their real-life friends on its app, for example by asking for access to users’ address books, and even swapping out its Discover tab for a Friends tab. Plus, as you browse your For You feed, you’ll also see recommendations of people to follow. Some users report that people they know have been finding their TikTok accounts thanks to what appears to be based on address book-based phone number matching, as well. (And they’re not all happy about it.)</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, TikTok hasn’t been entirely transparent about what it’s up to here, but this BeReal clone makes it a lot more obvious: it wants users’ friend graphs. It wants to be a social network, too.</p>\n<p>This reason is simple. Younger, Gen Z users are adopting new online behaviors when it comes to social networking. They’re moving away from older social networks, like Facebook, and have even begun to find Instagram increasingly crowded and annoying with its Reels focus. Gen Z instead is using video networking on apps like Yubo, and checking in on close friends through apps like BeReal. If TikTok doesn’t move into these areas, too, then this in-demand demographic will continue to take part in these new networking experiences in other apps, potentially impacting the time they have to spend on TikTok — which hurts its own business. It would also prevent TikTok from developing features that cater to real-world friends in the future, which could make its app more comprehensive than the video timewaster it is today.</p>\nMore\niOS 16 adoption is faster than iOS 15\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: Mixpanel</p><p></p>\n<p>According to data from Mixpanel (via iMore), there’s greater consumer demand for iOS 16 compared with the release of iOS 15 last year. After the first 24 hours, iOS 16 had been downloaded by 6.71% of users, versus 6.48% of users who downloaded iOS 15. However, both updates had trailed iOS 14, which reached 9.22% of users its first day. However, iOS 14 was a major consumer update, as it introduced Home Screen widgets for the first time. While iOS 16 brings another widget format — Lock Screen widgets — other features, like Live Activities, are still to come.</p>\n<p>As of Friday, Mixpanel notes iOS 16 has 16.76% adoption, but 72.98% of users are still on iOS 15 at this time; 10.26% of users are on an even older OS.</p>\nSocial media cos get grilled by the Senate\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images / Getty Images</p><p></p>\n<p>The social app makers were hauled into Congress for another hearing this week. After having to answer for their lack of minor protections in their apps last year, this time around the companies were testifying before the Senate Homeland Security Committee about what risks they may pose to national security. For Meta, the hearing was a much-needed reprieve as many of the senators had their eyes on TikTok instead — especially after reports that TikTok U.S. user data was accessed by employees in China.</p>\n<p>The companies were asked to disclose the number of full-time employees they have on their trust and safety teams, but all except Twitter refused to answer. Twitter, however, said it it has 2,200 people working on trust and safety across its platform, though it wasn’t clear if some did other work. Meta was asked how many of the 40,000 people it reportedly had on trust and safety were focused on non-U.S. users and non-English language issue, and the company didn’t answer.</p>\n<p>TikTok, meanwhile, was pressed hard on its relationship with the Chinese government. COO Vanessa Pappas denied the reporting from BuzzFeed about employee access to user data and dodged other questions — including one about how many of its employees were members of the Chinese Communist Party. She also said TikTok was not collecting U.S. users’ biometric data, even though the company had quietly updated its privacy policy last year to allow it to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Meta, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter dodge questions on social media and national security</p>\n<p></p>\nAdobe’s big bet on Figma\n<p>Adobe’s stunning $20 billion acquisition of digital design company Figma this week was a big bet that takes out one of its biggest rivals, even if it meant paying twice as much as Figma’s most recent private valuation. What does this mean for the company going forward, and what other design startups could be next? TechCrunch+ has the answers.</p>\n<p>This Week in Apps readers can take 15% off an annual pass to TechCrunch+ with the code “TWIA.” </p>\n\nAdobe makes a $20B bet on a collaborative future with Figma acquisition\nAfter the Figma-Adobe deal, which design startups are acquisition targets?\n\nWeekly Updates\nPlatforms: Apple\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: Apple</p><p></p>\n\niOS 16 debuted.

The startup is using Yoti’s age estimation technology, which uses the phone camera to take a photo and a short video of the user’s face, verifying ages with 98.9% accuracy. The company has 60 million users and had initially started verifying ages of those who said they were younger, like 13 or 14 years old.\n\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: Yubo</p><p></p>\n\nDiscord launched a new Forum Channels feature to help server owners better organize conversations. The feature involves sub-channels that can be used to branch off conversations about particular topics or to avoid having to create another channel for focused conversations.\nSnapchat for Web began to roll out to all users worldwide, after initial tests as a Snapchat+ feature. The web version allows users to send messages and snaps, chat via video and voice, and access the mobile app’s messaging features, like chat reactions.

The feature adds personalized hubs called “Stations” that group together content by topic, like news, music, sports and more.\nTikTok competitor YouTube Shorts launched a new feature that more closely integrates the feature with YouTube Music. Now, users can save songs they discover in Shorts to listen to later in YouTube Music, via a custom playlist, “Sounds on Shorts.”\nSpotify and Wattpad struck a deal to launch a series of exclusive podcasts in Indonesia and the Philippines to bring popular web novels to life, including “My Ice Girl,” which has 22 million reads on Wattpad; “The Four Bad Boys and Me,” which has 321 million reads; and “For Hire: A Damn Good Kisser,” which has 42.1 million reads.\nSpotify’s Live streaming platform is not going well. The company this week had to cancel a performance by Ghost, claiming the demand for the event had caused technical difficulties. (One Twitter user noted that may not have actually been the case, but rather the access password had leaked causing other users to pop up rooms with people who hadn’t been invited, they said.)\nYouTube’s video platform, Shorts, may soon offer creators to earn payments and place ads in their videos, The NYT learned. It expects to announce the changes on Tuesday.\nYouTube also this week introduced a new feature that would allow creators to make new Shorts directly from their video’s comments. The feature very much duplicates similar functionality on TikTok, where creators can turn comments into new videos allowing them to continue the conversation or respond to users’ comments with a rebuttal or further explanation of their own.\n\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: YouTube</p><p></p>\n\nAmazon announced its live radio app Amp, a sort of Spotify Live or Clubhouse competitor, would gain a new creator fund that will help reward creators who build engaging shows and attract a loyal audience. The company said it allocated “millions of dollars” for this fund, but declined to provide an exact figure.

Among the 73 new publishing licenses that were approved, 69 were for mobile games. Other developers also received licenses, including Zhong Qing Bao, Leiting, XD Inc. and CMGE Technology Group.\n\nHealth &amp; Fitness\n\nFollowing the overturn of Roe v Wade, the period-tracking app Flo launched a new “anonymous mode” feature on iOS which gives users the option to use the app without their name, email address or technical identifiers associated with their health data. The feature will come to Android next month.\n\nUtilities\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: Opal</p><p></p>\n\nOpal, a “digital well-being assistant,” rolled out a rebuilt version of its app designed to help individuals better monitor and manage their screen time usage. While most screen time apps are focused on helping parents manage their children’s screen time, Opal is aimed at anyone who wants to create better digital habits. The older version relied on a VPN to manage access to certain apps, but the new Opal now uses Apple’s Screen Time API to provide reports on screen time usage and temporarily block users from their distracting apps.\n\nGovernment &amp; Policy\n\nAn EU court backed the European Commission’s decision to fine Google over Android antitrust breaches, but lessened the fine from €4.34 billion to €4.1 billion.\nSouth Korea’s privacy regulator fined Google around $50 million and Meta $22 million for failing to obtain user consent when collecting behavioral data for showing tailored ads.\nCalifornia passed a new law on Thursday, the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, that will make it the first state to introduce legislation aimed at protecting the well-being, data and privacy of children using online platforms.

If clicked, the page may take users to download malware.\n\nFunding and M&amp;A\n<p> In a massive deal, Adobe announced plans to acquire UI design and prototyping tool Figma for around $20 billion, half in cash and half in stock. Figma CEO Dylan Field will continue to lead the company following the deal close.

        "description": "<p>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here.</p>\n<p>I first covered Launch House in Oct 2020, when the co-founders described a strong focus on inclusion when creating hacker homes. A co-founder said then, “I wouldn’t say we’re the next Y Combinator, but the next YC would look something like that.” The company soon went onto raise venture funding for its vision of what a next-generation entrepreneurial ecosystem looks like, combining remote work’s benefits with the rising mindshare around “community.” It won over investment dollars from Andreessen Horowitz, Lightship, CAA co-founder Michael Ovitz, Electric Ant’s Chris Ovitz, 6th Man Ventures’ Mike Dudas and other angels.</p>\n<p>Now, a Vox investigation this past week highlighted specific allegations around harassment, sexual assault and misuse of power at Launch House. The response has been complex. The irony with the “build in public” mindset is that, when allegations and scrutiny surface, privacy — or at least opacity — is back in vogue.</p>\n<p>As TechCrunch reports, some existing investors in the startup and its venture fund have issued public statements supporting the alleged victims and denouncing the alleged behavior described by Vox in its article about Launch House. Launch House, meanwhile, confirmed to TechCrunch via a spokesperson that it is launching an independent, third-party investigation through a retained law firm.</p>\n<p>Days after the investigation went live, Launch House held a town hall with some members of their community. Co-founder Michael Houck said that the startup “dropped the ball on responding to this quickly enough [and] with enough compassion … that isn’t reflective of the values that we’ve built this community on from day one and that we care about.”</p>\n<p>“Put more simply, we absolutely should have met with you all sooner than today,” Houck added, “What I can say now is that we’re ready to speak and we have a plan.” The conversation focused on three topics: what Launch House says it has done in the past, what it will do in the future and how it plans to build back trust with female founders in their cohorts.</p>\n<p>The Vox investigation, Launch House’s response both publicly and privately, as well as the community’s either outrage or silence over surfaced allegations is a reminder that community isn’t a buzzword. It’s a challenge. Some people may look at LH as a caricature of the “community-based VC-backed startup” trend, but this offers a real look at what happens when these “buzzy trends” meet a bull market, in a remote world, with limited checks and balances.</p>\n<p>For the full story of key details in the private town hall, read my story: “Launch House holds private town hall, says investigation is underway.” For the investor and community reaction, read my story with Rebecca Szkutak, “Launch House’s community reacts to misconduct and harassment allegations.”</p>\n<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’re talking about Y Combinator’s paranoia, fund manager shifts and a follow-up on one of the pandemic startups admitting it’s wrong. Make sure to read the whole thing as I’ve snuck in a TC+ discount code, especially for Startups Weekly readers, in the post.</p>\n<p>If you like this newsletter, do me a quick favor? Forward it to a friend, share it on Twitter, and tag me so I can thank you for reading myself!</p>\nY Combinator is still paranoid\n<p>Y Combinator’s Michael Seibel, managing partner and head of the accelerator, is one of the most influential people in startups. He joined Equity to chat about the point of demo day, diversity challenges and competition.</p>\n<p>Here’s why it’s important: Given the fact that YC doesn’t do a ton of press anymore, the interview clarified some misconceptions. More on TechCrunch+ tomorrow, but in the meantime, here’s how he described the utility of demo days.</p>\n<p>It’s hard for me to generalize on demo days. There’s a lot of different demo days out in the world, and I don’t really know how they work.</p>\n<p>I would say YC’s Demo Day has two functions. The first is the obvious one, which is: present the companies and drive leads. The second is as a forcing function to the founders, right? Just [as] YC doesn’t necessarily need an application deadline. In fact, we read applications all year ‘round. But as a forcing function to [say] “Hey, there’s this date that we want to accomplish this thing by and it’s important,” [it] really, really helps the founders get up to top speed faster, as opposed to a more generalized system.</p>\n<p>I would say [Demo Day] also helps the investors. If I’m an investor, and I’m talking to a company, and I know that they’re going to be raising [at] Demo Day in a week, I might make my decision a little faster. So one of the things we tell founders who go through YC is [that] different companies will leverage Demo Day differently. And that’s OK. It’s a tool and your job is to use it as best you can for your company.</p>\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: Bryce Durbin</p><p></p>\nFigma exits\n<p>Adobe snapped up Figma for $20 billion, reminding us that M&amp;A can, indeed, happen in 2022. As TC’s Ingrid Lunden reports:</p>\n<p>The idea now will be to create a seamless connection between these and Figma, essentially building it out as the native platform to bring them all together. Adobe, of course, already had something like this, in the form of AdobeXD. It’s not clear what will happen when this deal closes. Indeed, whether all this will raise the attention of antitrust authorities will be worth watching: Adobe is already dominant in so many of the tools that are used, and now it will be the dominant player as well in the platform to bring in and provision all of these tools.</p>\n<p>Here’s why it’s important: Massive acquisitions have a way with ripple effects. In this case, Adobe just joined forces with one of its biggest rivals in digital design. Figma will soon no longer be a private company and thus not have to share its specific financials, and Figma employees, assumedly, are going to be a whole new generation of angel investors. There are also a lot of investors who won out due to this exit; a homogenous bunch, another notes. </p>\n\nAdobe makes $20B bet on a collaborative future with Figma acquisition\nAfter the Figma-Adobe deal, which design startups are acquisition targets?\nHow about that $20B Figma-Adobe deal?\n\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: Firn (opens in a new window) / Getty Images</p><p></p>\nThe follow-up\n<p>I’m experimenting with a new section in Startups Weekly, where each week we follow up with an old story or trend to see what’s changed since our first look.

        "description": "Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Luis Severino’s long-awaited return is imminent, and it could do wonders for this team.</p> <p>After not appearing in the big leagues since mid-July, a surprising move to the 60-day injured list, and a handful of rehab starts, Luis Severino’s return finally seems to be right around the corner. Up until his lengthy stint on the IL, Severino pitched 86 innings with a 3.45 ERA, striking out 27.2 percent of hitters and walking 7.2 percent. Perhaps most importantly, he largely resembled the pitcher that was so effective for the Yankees during his breakout 2017-2018 campaigns. </p>\n<p>The righty made three rehab appearances in the minors and has looked solid, and his return could be a huge addition for the Yankees as they head toward the end of the season. Severino’s last rehab appearance was Thursday with the RailRiders. In his first, on September 1 in Single-A, the right-hander pitched two innings, facing the minimum and striking out three. Six days later in Double-A, he pitched four innings, gave up two runs and struck out four more. And finally on Thursday, the 28-year-old pitched 4.1 innings, gave up two earned, walked one batter, and fanned six. All in all, Severino threw 10.1 innings, gave up four runs, striking out 13 batters and walking just one. It was a fairly encouraging sample, in part because he flashed quality velocity at times:</p>\n\n\n<p>Luis Severino’s final strikeout of the night came on this 96-mph check swing. pic.twitter.com/th6LWfhovo</p>— Conor Foley (@RailRidersTT) September 15, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>It seemed possible previously that Severino might find himself in a bullpen role upon his return, but it appears he will slot back into the Yankees’ rotation, as the team made a point to stretch him out more than some anticipated in his rehab process. How exactly Severino’s return plays out, both in regards to his performance and the exact expectations from the team, obviously can’t be fully known. But, there are plenty of implications that can be drawn from the right-hander’s return to the roster. </p>\n<p>As far as the rotation is concerned, there is likely an odd man out, with five healthy starters already on top of the imminent return of Severino. He has gotten up to 56 pitches in his rehab appearances, and is projected to start on Wednesday against the Pirates, following Domingo Germán’s start Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Longer-term, it remains to be seen whether Severino’s return will mean Germán moving to the bullpen, or having a fluid role. It’s possible even Severino could shift between roles. Either way, adding an arm like Severino’s can really only help this team. If nothing else, it certainly raises the floor of the Yankee rotation. With Severino looking mostly ready to go, and Germán making a serious case for himself recently, there are much worse problems to have than too many useful starters.</p>\n<p>If this means that someone moves to the bullpen full-time or has a hybrid role, that would seemingly only add to the depth out there, which is never a bad thing to have. In essence, adding a good pitcher to a roster is a always a positive thing. </p>\n<p>Luis Severino is a great pitcher at his best. Adding a potential impact arm like that, whether it’s to the rotation or elsewhere at some point, in the middle of September is a big deal. It would seem that Severino has a spot in the rotation, and if he does what he’s capable of doing, then that’s where he belongs on the Yankee roster. The right-hander has shown that he can still be an impact arm when he’s been on the mound this year, and certainly raises the potential of this pitching staff. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>Enlarge (credit: Ars Technica)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It's the weekend, which means it's time for another Dealmaster. Our latest roundup of the best tech deals from around the web includes a small but noteworthy discount on a one-month Disney+ subscription. If you're a new or lapsed subscriber to the streaming app, you can currently grab a month of service for $2, down from the usual $8. Disney technically kicked off this promotion last week, but the offer is set to end on September 19, so consider this a last-minute PSA.</p>\n<p>This isn't a massive discount, clearly, but if you were already thinking of checking out the Ars-approved Thor: Love and Thunder (which landed on the service earlier this month), trying She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (which is set to conclude within this trial period), going on another Simpsons binge, or watching any other Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, National Geographic, or kid-friendly Disney show, this is a lower barrier of entry all the same. It also comes before Disney implements ads into this tier of service later this year. Just note that your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default, but the offer's terms say that you can cancel anytime without losing the discounted month. Unfortunately, the deal isn't available to current subscribers.</p>\n<p>If you don't want any more Disney, though, our roundup also includes several deals on recommended charging gear from Anker, a variety of discounts on well-reviewed video games, lower-than-usual prices on MacBook Pros and the M2 MacBook Air, and much more. You can find our full curated list of deals below.</p><p>Read 1 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/3646592-these-ground-shots-can-help-bidens-cancer-moonshot-soar/",
        "description": "<p>This week, President Biden doubled down on his commitment to end cancer as we know it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The President’s Cancer Moonshot aims to reduce the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years and to improve the experience of people living with the disease. We were proud to join the Cancer Moonshot Goals Forum a few months ago, which convened a cross-section of leaders and voices in cancer research, advocacy and patient perspectives.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ambitious goal is within reach thanks in part to robust private and public partnerships, particularly investment in cancer research. As a result, between 1991 and 2019, U.S. cancer deaths decreased by 32 percent. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, greatly frustrated this progress. As people stopped seeking routine screenings and visiting their doctors, patients missed an estimated 9.4 million screening tests that normally would have taken place in the United States in 2020. Average weekly new cancer diagnoses plummeted by 46 percent across major cancer types, including leading killers like breast and colorectal cancers. While diagnosis and treatment rates are rising again, COVID-19 continues to disrupt progress given the potentially lethal ramifications of delays in prognosis and treatment.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our country’s changing demographics also present challenges. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) project that cancer incidence rates will increase in the U.S. by almost 50 percent between 2015 and 2050 due to the growth and aging of the population. This number rises even higher among communities of color, particularly Black Americans, who have the highest death rates from cancer in the U.S., despite lower overall incidence.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Addressing these access and disparity challenges in the short term is paramount to achieving the Cancer Moonshot’s long-term goal of ending cancer as we know it. While the Cancer Moonshot Cabinet has developed priority action pillars, we believe that public-private cooperation around the following “ground shots” will play a critical role in improving the care available to patients today, as well as laying the groundwork for bringing a cure for all patients with cancer in the future.  </p>\n\n\n\nIncreasing access to screening and resulting follow-up cancer care. When we act early on cancer, patients have the best chance of continuing to live full lives. Prioritizing access to and through screening for those at risk, particularly in breast, cervical, lung, colon and prostate cancers, will increase the number of patients whose disease is caught early. This, in addition to supporting access to follow-up care, as well as creative ways to improve access to underserved patients such as mobile screening programs, best positions patients to overcome their disease.  \n\n\n\nBoosting HPV vaccination rates. The human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to cause six types of cancer, including nearly all cervical cancers as well as throat, anal, penile, vaginal and vulvar cancers. Since its approval over 15 years ago, the HPV vaccine was introduced and is highly effective at preventing more than 90 percent of these cancers. Through increasing vaccination rates in pre-teen boys and girls, it’s possible to eliminate many of these types of HPV  and the cancers caused by the virus.  \n\n\n\nInvesting in patient navigators. Navigating the health care system following a cancer diagnosis can pose an enormous challenge for patients. Patient navigators play a critical role in guiding patients through the care continuum — from screening to diagnosis, accessing care, undergoing treatment and follow-up. They also help patients and their families address a range of access challenges, such as pursuing financial assistance, securing transportation and caring for children or elderly relatives. Availability of these services is uneven across the health care system and, significantly, not a reimbursable expense with public and many private insurance programs. Making patient navigator services widely available and reimbursable will enable more equitable delivery of cancer care and improve patient outcomes. \n\n\n\nMaking equity more measurable to enable progress. To more easily identify gaps in care, as well as to enhance accountability, we propose establishing a scorecard with clear benchmarks and quantifying metrics on health equity needs. We must also ensure that cancer research reflects the patient population by investing in more diverse clinical trial participation, as well as ensuring the representation of minority groups among researchers.  \n\n\n\n<p>The White House’s Cancer Moonshot initiative should serve as a global impetus and vital convener to establish that best practices spread and ensure the dissemination of good ideas far and wide. To truly make progress against these goals, we need to work together — not just as a nation — but as a global cancer community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After hearing the President’s words this week, we are more committed than ever to collaborating with diverse stakeholders on this important mission. Our passion for defeating a disease that has taken far too many lives has never been stronger. Let’s align our focus to achieve this critical mission together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karen E. Knudsen, MBA, Ph.D., is CEO of the American Cancer Society. Dave Fredrickson is executive vice president, Oncology Business Unit, at AstraZeneca.  </p>",

        "description": "Benny Sieu-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Near three-way tie among fans about who should play center field down the stretch</p> <p>Welcome to SB Nation Reacts, a survey of fans across the MLB. Throughout the year we ask questions of the most plugged-in Milwaukee Brewers fans and fans across the country. Sign up here to participate.</p>\n<p>In this week’s Reacts survey, we asked fans what the Brewers should do about center field in the final few weeks of the season. The results were almost perfectly split, with 29% of fans wanting the Crew to call up Esteury Ruiz, 28% of fans wanting to call up Sal Frelick, and 27% wanting to see a split between Garrett Mitchell and Tyrone Taylor, the current big-league center fielders. The final 16% voted to start Taylor and have Mitchell enter as a defensive sub late in games.</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>While the survey closed earlier this week, there’s a chance the percentage voting for Mitchell may have increased after Friday night’s win over the Yankees. Mitchell, who entered the night hitting .138/.242/.276, went 2-for-4 with two singles and a walk, including the walk-off hit in the bottom of the ninth for a 7-6 win.</p>\n<p>Mitchell also saw a whopping 34 pitches across his five plate appearances, helping the Crew get Frankie Montas out of the game in the fourth inning after working a seven-pitch walk.</p>\n<p>Taylor is slashing .224/.281/.436 with 16 homers and 47 RBIs with the Brewers this season, earning most of the playing time in center after the DFA of Lorenzo Cain in June.</p>\n<p>Frelick and Ruiz have both had strong minor league seasons themselves. Frelick has slashed .328/.400/.467 with nine homers, 51 RBIs, and 21 steals across three levels while Ruiz has .336/.454/.541 with 16 homers, 58 RBIs, and 76 steals across AA and AAA. Ruiz also has limited major league experience this season, hitting .171/.194/.257 across 17 games.</p>\n<p>With just over two weeks to go in the season, the Brewers have plenty to consider heading into the postseason and 2023 with so many outfield options.</p>",

That's where the queen’s coffin is lying in state, draped in her Royal Standard and capped with a diamond-studded crown.</p><p>The numbers of mourners have grown steadily since the public was first admitted on Wednesday, with a queue that snakes around Southwark Park and stretches for at least 5 miles (8 kilometers).</p>Britain's King Charles III meets members of the public Saturday in the queue along the South Bank, near to Lambeth Bridge as they wait to view Queen Elizabeth II lying in state ahead of her funeral on Monday. Aaron Chown | Pool Photo via AP<p>Honoring their patience, King Charles III and his eldest son Prince William made an unannounced visit Saturday to greet people waiting to file past Elizabeth’s coffin, shaking hands and thanking mourners in the queue near Lambeth Bridge.</p><p>Later, all the queen's grandchildren stood by her coffin. William and Prince Harry, Charles' sons, were joined by Princess Anne’s children, Zara Tindall and Peter Philips; Prince Andrew’s daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie; and the two children of Prince Edward – Lady Louise Windsor and James, Viscount Severn.</p><p>William, now the heir to the throne, stood, his head bowed, at the head of the coffin and Harry at the foot. Both princes, who are military veterans, were in uniform. Mourners continued to file past in silence.</p><p>Harry, who served in Afghanistan as a British army officer, wore civilian clothes earlier in the week as the queen’s coffin left Buckingham Palace because he is no longer a working member of the royal family. He and his wife Meghan quit royal duties and moved to the United States in 2020. The king, however, requested that both William and Harry wear their military uniforms at the Westminster Hall vigil.</p><p>Before the vigil, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie issued a statement praising their “beloved grannie.”</p><p>“We, like many, thought you’d be here forever. And we all miss you terribly. You were our matriarch, our guide, our loving hand on our backs leading us through this world. You taught us so much and we will cherish those lessons and memories forever,” the sisters wrote.</p><p>People queuing to see the queen have been of all ages and come from all walks of life. Many bowed before the coffin or made a sign of the cross. Several veterans, their medals shining, offered sharp salutes. Some people wept. Others blew kisses. Many hugged one another as they stepped away, proud to have spent hours in line to offer a tribute, even if it lasted only a few moments.</p><p>Overnight, volunteers distributed blankets and cups of tea to people in line as temperatures fell to 6 degrees Celsius (43 degrees Fahrenheit). Despite the weather, mourners described the warmth of a shared experience.</p><p>“It was cold overnight, but we had wonderful companions, met new friends. The camaraderie was wonderful,'' Chris Harman of London said. “It was worth it. I would do it again and again and again. I would walk to the end of the earth for my queen.”</p><p>People had many reasons for coming, from affection for the queen to a desire to be part of a historic moment. Simon Hopkins, who traveled from his home in central England, likened it to “a pilgrimage.”</p><p>“(It) is a bit strange, because that kind of goes against my grain,” he said. “I’ve been kind of drawn into it.”</p><p>Saturday's vigil followed one on Friday in which the queen’s four children — Charles, Anne, Andrew and Edward — stood vigil at the coffin.</p><p>Edward said the royal family was “overwhelmed by the tide of emotion that has engulfed us and the sheer number of people who have gone out of their way to express their own love, admiration and respect (for) our dear mama.”</p><p>On Saturday, the new king was holding audiences with incoming prime ministers, governor generals of the realms and military leaders.</p><p>The Metropolitan Police arrested a man Friday night during the viewing for a suspected public order offense. Parliamentary authorities said someone got out of the queue and tried to approach the coffin.</p><p>Tracey Holland told Sky News that her 7-year-old niece Darcy Holland was pushed out of the way by a man who tried to “run up to the coffin, lift up the standard and try to do I don’t know what.” She said police detained the man in “two seconds.”</p><p>The lying-in-state continues until early Monday morning, when the queen’s coffin will be borne to nearby Westminster Abbey for a state funeral, the finale of 10 days of national mourning for Britain’s longest-reigning monarch. Elizabeth, 96, died at her Balmoral Estate in Scotland on Sept. 8 after 70 years on the throne.</p><p>After the service Monday at the abbey, the late queen’s coffin will be transported through the historic heart of London on a horse-drawn gun carriage. It will then be taken in a hearse to Windsor, where the queen will be interred alongside her late husband, Prince Philip, who died last year.</p><p>Hundreds of troops from the British army, air force and navy held an early-morning rehearsal Saturday for the final procession. As troops lined the picturesque path leading to Windsor Castle, the thumping of drums echoed in the air as marching bands walked ahead of a hearse.</p><p>London police say the funeral will be the largest single policing event the force has ever handled, surpassing even the 2012 Summer Olympics and the Platinum Jubilee in June celebrating the queen’s 70-year reign.</p>",

        "description": "Bradish will look to dominate the Jays the same way he’s been dominating every other team lately,  | Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Despite losing in game 1, the Orioles still have chance Saturday to make up ground in the AL Wild Card race. </p> <p>There was plenty of bad news that came out of Friday’s loss to the Blue Jays. The offense struggled again, and the Orioles continued to falter at opportunities to claw their way back into the Wild Card race. The good news, however, was that the Tampa Bay Rays—the O’s new competitor for the last AL Wild Card slot—also lost on Friday. This means the Orioles are no worse off heading into Saturday than they were when this series against Toronto started. </p>\n<p>Right now, the Rays are on a 90-win pace, meaning Baltimore will have to go 15-4 over their remaining 19 games to stand a decent chance of chasing down the Rays—or the Mariners, or the Blue Jays. While that doesn't seem exceedingly likely, getting a win over Toronto today would certainly help. </p>\n<p>The chances today are buoyed by the fact that Kyle Bradish gets the ball for the O’s. Bradish has been the hot hand in the Orioles' starting rotation over the last three weeks, as Baltimore is 3-1 in Bradish’s fourth start with the rookie posting a 1.44 ERA. Yes, that one loss came against the Jays and Bradish didn’t make it to the fourth inning in that game. Hopefully, the memory of that loss provides Bradish with plenty of motivation to come out hot against Toronto today. </p>\n<p>Offensively, the Orioles will likely need big performances from their three rookies if they are to get out ahead of Jose Berrios and the Jays. While the righty from Puerto Rico has struggled for most of the 2022 season, Berrios has put up much better numbers against Baltimore. However, rookies Adley Rutschman, Kyle Stowers and GUNNAR HENDERSON are a combined 7-15 off Berrios. With all three in the lineup today, they could provide a spark for an Orioles offense that, otherwise, has only hit Berrios at a .174 clip. </p>\nOrioles Lineup\n\nCedric Mullins (L) CF\nAdley Rutschman (S) C\nAnthony Santander (S) RF\nRyan Mountcastle (R) 1B\nGUNNAR HENDERSON (L) SS\nTerrin Vavra (L) 2B\nRougned Odor (L) DH\nRamon Urias (R) 3B\nKyle Stowers (L) LF\n\nBlue Jays Lineup \n\nGeorge Springer (R) CF\nVlad Guerrero Jr. (R) 1B\nBo Bichette (R) SS\nMatt Chapman (R) 3B\nTeoscar Hernandez (R) RF\nRaimel Tapia (L) LF\nDanny Jansen (R) C\nCavan Biggio (L) 1B\nSantiago Espinal (R) 2B",

        "description": "<p>Enlarge (credit: Ars Technica)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It's the weekend, which means it's time for another Dealmaster. Our latest roundup of the best tech deals from around the web includes a small but noteworthy discount on a one-month Disney+ subscription. If you're a new or lapsed subscriber to the streaming app, you can currently grab a month of service for $2, down from the usual $8. Disney technically kicked off this promotion last week, but the offer is set to end on September 19, so consider this a last-minute PSA.</p>\n<p>This isn't a massive discount, clearly, but if you were already thinking of checking out the Ars-approved Thor: Love and Thunder (which landed on the service earlier this month), trying She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (which is set to conclude within this trial period), going on another Simpsons binge, or watching any other Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, National Geographic, or kid-friendly Disney show, this is a lower barrier of entry all the same. It also comes before Disney implements ads into this tier of service later this year. Just note that your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default, but the offer's terms say that you can cancel anytime without losing the discounted month. Unfortunately, the deal isn't available to current subscribers.</p>\n<p>If you don't want any more Disney, though, our roundup also includes several deals on recommended charging gear from Anker, a variety of discounts on well-reviewed video games, lower-than-usual prices on MacBook Pros and the M2 MacBook Air, and much more. You can find our full curated list of deals below.</p><p>Read 1 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

However, in 2022, the same products are apparently being brought back by a different MLM company under a different name...<br /><br /> BlackOxygen Organics, a MLM, touted its products of fulvic acid as derived from natural Canadian peat bog, and can be used as food supplement or applied as facemask. During mid 2021, some BOO peddlers even claimed that consuming BOO products provided relief from COVID. <br />\n<br />\nChemically, fulvic acid is formed from organic matter decay (i.e. bodies and plants decomposing) and there is no compelling scientific evidence they have any benefits as a food supplement, merely some suggestions of benefits in Alzheimer's. <br />\n<br />\nBOO crashed hard in late 2021 when FDA warned the public about BlackOxygen Organics  because its powder and tablets contained elevated levels of lead and arsenic. The MLM company immediately shut down, as it also faced a class-action lawsuit from some former affiliates.  HealthCanada has a similar recall. <br />\n<br />\nHowever, it seems BOO won't stay dead. TINA.org reported that the entire BOO affiliate list was apparently sold to another MLM company, Youngevity, in early 2022, and all BOO affiliates are converted to Yougevity affiliates. And now, in September 2022, Youngevity is bringing back the same products but under a new name, \"Midnight Minerals\", and the former BOO affiliates, now Youngevity affiliates, are telling everybody that it's \"the same thing\".",

        "description": "Photo by Casey Sykes/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>This is a nightmare pitching matchup for the Braves, so they’ll be hoping the offense can come through big.</p> <p>The Braves won 7-2 on Friday night in the series opener against the Phillies, riding a big six run eighth inning to victory. While Friday was a very favorable pitching matchup for Atlanta, the opposite is true for Saturday’s game, as the Braves’ fifth starter, Jake Odorizzi, faces off against the Phillies’ top starter and Cy Young candidate, Aaron Nola. </p>\n<p>Nola has been fantastic this season, boasting a 2.80/2.63/2.84 FIP/xFIP/xERA slash-line over nearly 180 innings, although suffering a bit from the Phillies’ pitiful defense, ballooning his ERA to 3.31 (still a very strong number). Nola has had strong strikeout and walk rates, with 10.14 K/9 and 1.20 BB/9. He primarily pitches with four pitches, sprinkling in the occasional cutter as a fifth, with a four-seamer, sinker, changeup and curveball all being fairly effective pitches. The changeup is the most hittable of these, with his signature curveball being his most effective according to Statcast’s expected outcomes.</p>\n<p>Odorizzi has not been particularly popular among Braves fans, but is a pretty established pitcher at the major league level that is not out of place as a back-end starter for a good team, as our own Brad Rowland will point out.</p>\n<p>While this looks bad on paper, baseball continues to be a sport of high variance and the Braves absolutely have the talent to get to Nola. Winning this game is likely to be challenging but could be big in the divisional race.</p>\nGame Info\n<p>Date: Saturday, September 17, 2022</p>\n<p>Time: 7:20 pm EDT</p>\n<p>Location: Truist Park, Atlanta, GA</p>\n<p>TV: Bally Sports Southeast</p>\n<p>Radio: 680 AM/93.7 FM The Fan, La Mejor 1600/1460/1130 AM</p>\n<p>XM Radio: Ch. 182</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

        "link": "https://torrentfreak.com/isp-hopes-to-defeat-record-labels-piracy-liability-claims-at-trial-220917/",
        "description": "<p>Three years ago, several of the world’s largest music companies including Warner Bros. and Sony Music sued Internet Provider Grande Communications.</p>\n<p>The recording labels accused the ISP, which is owned by Astound, of not doing enough to stop pirating subscribers. Specifically, they alleged that the company failed to terminate repeat infringers.</p>\n<p>Since the complaint was filed, both parties have gone back and forth in court with various arguments and accusations. The legal battle will soon go to trial and both parties filed preparatory documents in court this week.</p>\n<p>As part of the jury selection process, the record labels and the ISP have submitted their statement of claims, which provide a clear and concise overview of the issues at stake. </p>\nGrande Denies Liability\n<p>Grande Communications believes that it shouldn’t be held liable for the alleged copyright infringements committed by its subscribers. The company portrays itself as a neutral service provider that never encouraged any type of piracy. </p>\n<p>“Grande disputes the plaintiffs’ claim that Grande is liable for acts of copyright infringement allegedly committed by its subscribers. Grande asserts that it is merely an internet service provider and never induced or encouraged anyone to infringe the plaintiffs’ copyrights.”</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The ISP calls out the record labels’ piracy monitoring service Rightscorp which, according to Grande, cannot accurately or reliably identify copyright infringements. In addition, the piracy tracking company allegedly destroyed or failed to preserve key evidence. </p>\n<p>As a result, the copyright infringement notices that Rightcorp sent via email were insufficient to warrant any drastic measures, Grande suggests. Therefore, the company firmly believes that it shouldn’t be held liable.</p>\n<p>“Rightscorp’s emails to Grande were flawed and unreliable, because of defects in Rightscorp’s system and because the emails lacked any supporting or verifiable evidence,” the ISP notes. </p>\nRecord Labels Seek Millions\n<p>The statement of claim from the record labels argues the polar opposite. According to the music companies, it’s clear that the ISP is liable, alleging that Grande willingly profited from pirating subscribers. </p>\n<p>With 1,422 sound recordings at stake, the amount of potential statutory damages that the jury can award exceeds $213 million.</p>\n<p>At trial, the labels plan to show the jury that Grande was aware of this piracy problem since the early 2000s. Initially, it responded by terminating accounts of subscribers, but as time progressed the ISP changed course.</p>\n<p>“[B]eginning in 2010, in an effort to increase profits, Grande eliminated its termination policy and chose instead to allow its subscribers to infringe copyrights freely with no consequences,” the labels write. </p>\n<p>After this decision, the music companies sent over a million piracy notices and they allege that Grande failed to terminate even a single account in response. </p>\n<p>“Yet despite knowing of, or deliberately avoiding learning about, specifically identified repeat infringements by its customers, Grande continued to provide those customers the internet service essential to their continuing their unlawful conduct,” they write.</p>\n<p>The lack of terminations allegedly allowed the Internet provider to increase its profits while causing significant damage to the labels and their artists. </p>\nDo You Read TorrentFreak?\n<p>In addition to the statements of claim, both sides will also ask prospective jury members to answer a series of questions. These can help to detect biases and other issues that might make a person unfit to sit on the bench. </p>\n<p>The labels’ questions are similar to the ones we’ve reported on the past. They want to know how familiar candidates are with file-sharing and whether they ever downloaded something from The Pirate Bay or other torrent sites. </p>\n<p>There are also questions about the use of stream-ripping services and support for the EFF. In addition, TorrentFreak gets a mention as well, together with Ars Technica, another news site. </p>\n<p>“Have you ever read or visited Ars Technica or TorrentFreak? If so, for what type of material?” the labels plan to ask potential jury members.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These questions could theoretically steer potential jurors in a certain direction. Even those who have never heard of TorrentFreak may be intrigued by the question and start reading it going forward. But that’s probably not the goal here.</p>\n<p>The music companies are not the only ones asking questions of course. Grande Communications has also prepared a list, hoping to signal bias or other disqualifying factors.</p>\n<p>The ISP asks, for example, if the candidates are musicians or have ever worked at a record label, and whether they believe it’s an ISP’s responsibility to monitor and police online piracy.</p>\nMoving Forward\n<p>After the jury members are selected the case will move to trial in a few weeks. Both parties expect to need a total of 10 days to present evidence and argue their case.</p>\n<p>This isn’t the first case between record labels and an ISP that’s been scheduled to go to trial this year. Charter Communications and Bright House were in the same position but both companies signed a settlement agreement instead. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a group of independent filmmakers recently filed new piracy liability lawsuits against Verizon, AT&amp;T and Comcast so the U.S. federal courts are not done with these repeat infringer lawsuits just yet.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>Copies of the record labels’ statement of claim and voir dire questions are available here (1,2) and Grande’s versions can be found here (1,2)</p>\n<p>From: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Right-wing attempts to ban books are showing no sign of slowing down, according to a report released Friday by the American Library Association — and in fact have reached an unprecedented level, with libraries and bookstores increasingly facing legal threats over the materials on their shelves.</p>\n<p>The organization, which has been tracking book-banning efforts for more than 20 years, found that so far in 2022, parents and other community members have “challenged” 1,651 different books and have issued 681 complaints across the country.</p>\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>681 challenges to books in the first eight months of this year, involving 1,651 different titles. #UniteAgainstBookBans #BannedBooksWeek https://t.co/0K4rmd13F7</p>\n<p>— American Library Association (@ALALibrary) September 16, 2022</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In 2021, 1,597 individual books were the subject of challenges, which can include written complaints, forms provided by and submitted to a library, or social media posts in which people demand books be removed from a library’s collection. </p>\n<p>Friday’s report showed that right-wing groups like Moms for Liberty have escalated their attacks on library patrons’ right to access certain books, with 27 police reports having been filed so far this year over accusations that librarians are providing inappropriate or “pornographic” material to children. </p>\n<p>“We’re truly fearful that at some point we will see a librarian arrested for providing constitutionally protected books on disfavored topics,” Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the Office of Intellectual Freedom at ALA, told The New York Times.</p>\n<p>Book challenges this year have mainly focused on titles that center Black or LGBTQ+ characters, according to the Times.</p>\n<p>The graphic novel Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe, a memoir about the author’s coming of age as a nonbinary person, has been the most frequently targeted book so far this year.</p>\n<p>The book was at the center of a vote in Jamestown Township, Michigan last month in which residents rejected essential funding for the town’s library, prompting concerns that the library will be forced to close within the next year.</p>\n<p>Parents in a town in Washington also filed police reports against the school district for including Gender Queer in a school library’s collection, and a Republican lawmaker sued Barnes &amp; Noble to prohibit it from selling the book to minors — a lawsuit that was dismissed last month.</p>\n<p>ALA president Lessa Kanani’opua Pelayo-Lozada said the group’s report “reflects coordinated, national efforts to silence marginalized or historically underrepresented voices and deprive all of us—young people, in particular — of the chance to explore a world beyond the confines of personal experience.”</p>\n<p>Banning books that discuss racial inequality or LGBTQ+ issues “denies young people resources that can help them deal with the challenges that confront them,” added Pelayo-Lozada. “Efforts to censor entire categories of books reflecting certain voices and views shows that the moral panic isn’t about kids: It’s about politics.”</p>",

Jake Auchincloss, Bill Keating, Jim McGovern, Seth Moulton, Ayanna Pressley, and Lori Trahan sent a letter to the department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) given the governor’s use of the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (SLFRF) “to cruelly relocate vulnerable immigrants from Florida to other states across the country.”</p>\n<p>The lawmakers suggested the state’s “inhumane program” violates federal law and urged the OIG to not only investigate but also “take all necessary action — including potentially rescinding any misused funds — to stop this abuse of coronavirus relief programs.”</p>\n<p>Reportedly lured in by the false promise of jobs, one migrant from Peru and 49 from Venezuela — including children — were flown to the Massachusetts island community on Wednesday. While residents welcomed them and rushed to provide food, clothing, and shelter, DeSantis has faced intense criticism for what the lawmakers and others have denounced as a “political stunt.”</p>\n\n<p>.@GovRonDeSantis’s relocation program isn’t just bigoted and inhumane, it’s illegal—misusing federal COVID-19 relief funds for a cruel political stunt that unjustly and severely harms already disadvantaged people. @USTreasury must investigate. pic.twitter.com/FDMEWM430d</p>\n<p>— Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) September 16, 2022</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To pull it off, the lawmakers’ letter explains, “DeSantis tapped a $12 million program that the Florida Legislature created earlier this year to allow the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) to ‘facilitate the transport of unauthorized aliens out of Florida.'”</p>\n<p>The letter highlights that “the $12 million was funded through ‘the interest earnings associated with the federal Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund,’ effectively using Covid-19 relief to score political points by exploiting vulnerable immigrants.”</p>\n<p>This conflicts with Congress’ intent for the SLFRF, which was established with the American Rescue Plan Act, the letter argues:</p>\n\n<p>As explained in the Treasury Department’s final rule implementing the Fund, the SLFRF was intended to “fight the pandemic and support families and businesses struggling with its public health and economic impacts; maintain vital public services, even amid declines in revenue resulting from the crisis; and build a strong, resilient, and equitable recovery by making investments that support long-term growth and opportunity.” That rule further identified a limited set of uses for SLFRF funds, including replacement of lost public sector revenue, responding to the far-reaching public health and economic impact of the pandemic, providing premium pay for essential workers, and investing in water, sewer, and broadband infrastructure.</p>\n<p>While the rule was designed to provide flexibility to state and local governments, Congress neither intended to allow, or authorized, state governments to use the SLFRF funds for immigration enforcement. Nothing in the American Rescue Plan Act or Treasury’s final rule appears to allow states to use SLFRF funds to remove or relocate immigrants. Florida therefore appears to be illegally using taxpayer money for theatrics intended to criminalize and stigmatize immigrants in search of a better life in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>The seven Massachusetts Democrats aren’t the only high-profile figures calling for a probe.</p>\n<p>DeSantis’ Democratic challenger for governor, Charlie Crist, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat, have both openly supported involvement by the U.S. Department of Justice, with the latter suggesting in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland that the Florida Republican’s actions could qualify for kidnapping charges.</p>\n<p>White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Friday compared DeSantis and GOP Texas Gov. Greg Abbott relocating asylum-seekers to actions of human smugglers.</p>\n<p>“These vulnerable migrants were reportedly misled about where they were headed — told they would be headed to Boston, misled about what they would be provided when they arrived, promised shelter, refuge, benefits, and more,” Jean-Pierre said. “These are the kinds of tactics we see from smugglers in places like Mexico and Guatemala. And for what? A photo-op.”</p>\n\n<p>The White House rips into GOP governors’ ‘political stunts’ with migrants:</p>\n<p>‘These are the kinds of tactics we see from smugglers … And for what? A photo op? Because these governors care about creating political theater [rather] than creating actual solutions’ pic.twitter.com/FkxdozwwAl</p>\n<p>— NowThis (@nowthisnews) September 16, 2022</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Axios reported that flight records indicate the planes chartered by DeSantis flew from San Antonio, Texas to Florida’s panhandle before landing in Massachusetts. After spending two nights at a Martha’s Vineyard church, the migrants on Friday were offered temporary housing on Joint Base Cape Cod.</p>\n<p>“We are grateful to the providers, volunteers, and local officials that stepped up on Martha’s Vineyard over the past few days to provide immediate services to these individuals,” said Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican. “Our administration has been working across state government to develop a plan to ensure these individuals will have access to the services they need going forward, and Joint Base Cape Cod is well-equipped to serve these needs.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in Florida, faith and immigrant leaders came together Friday to call out DeSantis.</p>\n<p>“Why does this feel so wrong?” Florida Immigrant Coalition (FLIC) spokesperson Stephanie Wall asked of the governor’s stunt just weeks away from his election. “Because it is wrong. Gov. DeSantis, this is anti-family, anti-freedom, anti-faith, and anti-opportunity.”</p>\n<p>HOPE CommUnity Center founder Sister Ann Kendrick said that “I think Jesus would be crying” and thanked the “good, hard-working people of Martha’s Vineyard… for stepping up and helping those immigrants who were lied to.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic still ongoing and monkeypox now deemed a public health emergency in the U.S., we are now officially in the midst of two viral-disease crises. Public health experts know what it takes to get a disease outbreak under control — widespread identification/testing, treatment and prevention. However, systemic issues with the financing and operation of health care in this country have created a public health system that is reactive instead of proactive. As a result, our public health system is chronically underfunded, understaffed and, in some areas, being stripped of its legal powers.</p>\n<p>Key federal public health preparedness and response programs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement, the Hospital Preparedness Program, and the Prevention and Public Health Fund — are not getting the resources they need. The CDC budget, a major source of funding for state and local health departments, has only risen by 11 percent over the past decade, after adjusting for inflation. The Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement and Hospital Preparedness Program have experienced cumulatively budget decreases of 48 percent and 61 percent, respectively, when accounting for inflation between the early 2000s and 2022. These programs experienced an influx of emergency funding in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, yet they were still operating well below pre-pandemic highs. The Prevention and Public Health Fund was established as part of the Affordable Care Act but has faced constant threats from policy makers trying to use it to offset costs for other administration priorities. Meanwhile, funding for state and local health departments has remained flat or declined over the past decade, while the health department workforce shrank 23 percent between 2008 and 2019.</p>\n<p>The way in which U.S. health departments are funded contributes to their workforce shortage issues and is one of the reasons why 50,000 public health jobs lost during the Great Recession of 2008 were never replaced. Many departments rely heavily on disease-specific grant funding, creating unstable and time-limited positions. The problem with this type of discretionary funding is multifactorial. It takes time and resources to apply for these grants, which is something most health departments are already lacking. Additionally, because funding is generally limited to use within a single fiscal year, recruitment of qualified personnel is challenging. In the face of comparatively low pay and uncertain funding year-to-year, more and more public health graduates are turning to the private sector for employment.</p>\n<p>As it stands, more than 40 percent of public health workers may leave their jobs during the next five years, according to results from the 2021 Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey. While the public health workforce is underpaid and overworked, the politicization of the COVID-19 pandemic response brought with it new issues that contributed to worker burnout, including negative public attention.</p>\n<p>Most public health officials have been accustomed to relative anonymity as they went about their work, but in recent times some have had to contend with armed protesters or threats to themselves or personal property. According to a study in the American Journal of Public Health, 57 percent of local health department reported experiencing harassment during the COVID-19 pandemic, which pushed 256 officials to quit between March 2020 and January 2021.</p>\n<p>This exodus of skilled public health workers will slowly erode the skills in governmental public health agencies and weaken their ability to respond to future emergencies. This comes at a time when current estimates show state and local public health departments need an 80 percent increase in their workforces to provide the minimum set of public health services (e.g., communicable disease control, chronic disease and injury prevention, assessment and surveillance, policy development and support, etc.) — according to a report from the de Beaumont Foundation. In times of simultaneous public health emergencies, like we are currently experiencing now, even more staffing is needed to provide the necessary “people power” for effective case investigation and contact tracing to slow down disease transmission.</p>\n<p>Additionally, many conservative state legislatures are rolling back the authority of public health agencies or officials to institute policies that protect the public’s health. At least 26 states have passed laws limiting public health powers. These have included legislative attempts to undermine the authority of public health agencies to close businesses in the name of public safety, institute mask mandates, vaccine requirements or quarantine infected individuals. Political pressure has also included threats to pull or redirect public health funding. Collectively, this will weaken local, state and national efforts to address the next pandemic.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, public health is often a victim of its own success. No one can see the disasters that are thwarted through preparedness, so it is easy to neglect the invisible. This feeds into a boom-and-bust cycle of public health spending in the face of emergencies.</p>\nNo one can see the disasters that are thwarted through preparedness, so it is easy to neglect the invisible.\n<p>The purse strings of public health funding are controlled by politicians who are voted into positions of power by the voters. Research has shown that U.S. voters view politicians more favorably for delivering disaster relief spending, like the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, compared to preparedness funding, with a significant relationship between increases in relief spending and additional votes. This incentivizes lawmakers to continue the reactive funding practice.</p>\n<p>Monkeypox has shown us that the next pandemic can occur before we have properly controlled the previous one. It is thus imperative that we improve the public health system in this country and better prepare ourselves for yet another pandemic that could strike at any moment.</p>\n<p>A more proactive approach to funding public health in this country doesn’t just involve spending more, it also involves changing how we appropriate these funds. One option would be for the government to increase the proportion of public health spending that is mandatory instead of discretionary, which would reduce the year-to-year funding variability that adversely affects state and local health departments.</p>\n<p>A second option would be for the government to replace siloed or categorical funding and instead provide more general funds that give public health agencies the flexibility to spend according to their priorities or emerging community needs.</p>\n<p>A third option would be for the government to award funding based on a measure of community need, like an “area deprivation index.” Doing so would be more equitable than awarding funding through competitive grant programs, which can further disparities by rewarding agencies with the resources and skills to submit successful grant applications at the expense of those in poor or underserved communities. No single policy can fix public health in this country, but these are some policies that can improve it.</p>",

        "link": "https://truthout.org/articles/right-wing-disinformation-campaigns-are-imperiling-access-to-trans-health-care/",
        "description": "<p>Trans health care is under attack on multiple fronts in the U.S., from direct anti-trans legislation, to cuts to vital resources, to the targeting of gender-affirming care providers.</p>\n<p>While dozens of states have proposed bills attacking trans health care in 2022, currently, three U.S. states already have passed laws restricting trans-affirming health care for minors: Alabama, Arizona and Arkansas. Alabama is the only state in which it is now a felony to provide certain care to minors. (Tennessee bans hormone replacement therapy for pre-pubertal children, even though such treatment is not actually practiced anywhere in the country.) Each of these three laws is under intense legal scrutiny. Arkansas’s law has been blocked by a federal judge from taking effect, and Arizona’s law doesn’t come into effect until 2023. The Williams Institute estimates that if all the bills filed against trans-affirming care for youth were passed in 2022, nearly 60,000 of the country’s 150,000 high school-aged trans youth would lose access to the care they need.</p>\n<p>While Florida does not currently ban trans-affirming care for anyone in the state, trans Floridians may not access Medicaid funds to cover the costs of their care. Medicaid is a state and federal partnership that covers the health care costs of low-income and disabled people. Transgender people are disproportionately low income, due to housing and employment discrimination, making this ban on coverage for low-income Floridians especially harmful.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile in Texas, the Republican governor and attorney general have been hard at work making it painful and dangerous for the families of trans children to live in the state. In February 2022, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a nonbinding legal opinion holding that some forms of trans-affirming care for minors constitute child abuse, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott followed the statement with a chilling announcement that the state’s Department of Family and Protective Services would be investigating the families of trans children to determine if they met these new life-threatening standards. Three families sued the state with the help of Lambda Legal and the ACLU of Texas. A Texas judge agreed with the parents’ assertion that the law could cause irreparable harm to their children and ordered an injunction of the directive, pausing investigations while the case proceeds.</p>\n<p>However, in the brief months during which the Texas governor’s directive was permitted to stand, children, parents and families were subjected to invasive and humiliating investigations and interrogations. By May, at least nine families were under active investigation by the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, according to the Texas Tribune.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the injunction has not meant the end of interrogations. In a recent addition to the suit against the state, one mother revealed that her 13-year-old son was removed from his classroom in late August and interrogated by department officials, while his responses were recorded. The eighth grader had been distressed by his state’s attacks on trans-affirming care at the beginning of the year but had calmed down for the start of the new school year, according to his mother, who is identified using the pseudonym Carol Koe in her signed declaration. Then the interrogation happened. The Washington Post reported: “He had a ‘meltdown’ after the meeting and asked his mother to pick him up, his mom said. He’s missed more classes and has frequent anxiety attacks, Carol Koe wrote. School for him is no longer the safe space it used to be, she claims.”</p>\n<p>The Koes’ story is just one of many in this larger landscape of attacks on trans-affirming care and thus trans lives themselves. Like Koe’s eighth-grade son, many other children and teens across the United States are suffering acute mental health impacts and diminished capacity to feel safe and well at school due to these laws and bills. Some youth are being denied affirming care, and those who do access care are enduring increased fears of persecution that severely impact mental health.</p>\nThe Williams Institute estimates that if all the bills filed against trans-affirming care for youth were passed in 2022, nearly 60,000 of the country’s 150,000 high school-aged trans youth would lose access to the care they need.\n<p>In additional to legislative measures, attacks on providers of gender-affirming care are also ramping up. Throughout the summer, Twitter account LibsofTikTok focused the ire of the anti-trans internet toward a number of children’s hospitals providing gender-affirming care, such as support for the parents of trans kids and guidance for families and schools supporting youth through social transition. Under the guise of concern for the children receiving this care, LibsofTikTok (the online face of former real estate agent Chaya Raichik) posted dozens of tweets to its million-plus followers, spreading dangerous lies about “pedophiles” and “groomers.” Raichik’s influence was thrown into clear view when Boston Children’s Hospital in Massachusetts began receiving bomb threats and death threats for providing trans-affirming care. And Raichik’s disregard for children’s actual health became all the more apparent when she refused to end her campaigns, even as the Boston Children’s Hospital had to briefly close its doors to visitors due to bomb threats.</p>\n<p>The impacts of campaigns like Raichik’s cannot be understated. Boston Children’s Hospital, like every children’s hospital, focuses on providing specialized care for children with health needs that are serious, rare and difficult to treat. The attacks on these hospitals make it very clear these anti-trans activists are comfortable sacrificing the health of thousands of children with serious illnesses, even terminal illnesses, in order to reduce the care available to trans children.</p>\n<p>The reality of trans-affirming care for youth in the United States is that it is difficult to access, and the vast majority of trans youth never do access it. In fact, research shows that there is a huge disconnect between trans youth and their providers: gate-keeping, wait lists and insurance refusals mean that many trans youth are not accessing the care they need. Meanwhile, each attack on health care makes it more difficult for youth and their families to access the lifesaving support they need.</p>\n<p>For trans youth, this lack of health care is often accompanied by a lack of other essential resources. According to the Trevor Project, a national LGBT suicide prevention organization, over one-third of transgender youth report having experienced homelessness or housing instability. Transgender youth comprise a precarious population of young people who rely on one another for resilience and survival, who live on the street and crash on one another’s couches, who don’t have access to routine medical and dental care, much less trans-affirming care, and who face violence and discrimination at many turns in their lives.</p>\n<p>The attack on trans health services in the United States will only exacerbate this lack of care, support and resources. And the disinformation campaigns appear to be at least partly working: Public opinion on trans health care is slipping, with 46 percent of American adults now agreeing that it should be illegal for health care professionals to offer trans-affirming care to minors. Just one year ago, a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll found that only 28 percent of Americans supported laws that “prohibited gender transition related medical care for minors.”</p>\n<p>Advocacy against trans-affirming care persists despite overwhelming medical consensus that trans-affirming care is evidence-based and lifesaving. The American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly endorse trans-affirming care for youth. Within the trans community itself, many underfunded organizations are spending their scarce resources on supporting trans lives on the ground and beating back negative laws and policies rather than pushing for expanded health care access.</p>\n<p>We have a crisis here in the United States that is endangering trans children’s lives. These consistent persistent attacks on trans health care will not stop with attacks on youth. Gov. DeSantis’s revocation of Medicaid coverage for trans adults makes that very clear. Unless and until we have strong leadership in support of trans-affirming care for everyone, more states will pass laws making it impossible for families to access care for their children, and the anti-trans lobby will move to banning trans-affirming care for adults, too.</p>",

        "description": "<p>German Marquez rebounded and Ryan McMahon homered.</p>\n<p>But the “Friendly Confines” were decided unfriendly for the road-challenged Rockies in a 2-1 loss to the Cubs on Friday afternoon at Wrigley Field.</p>\n<p>Cubs right-hander Marquez Stroman, who was winless at home entering Friday’s game, took a no-hitter into the sixth inning before McMahon hit a two-out solo homer to center.</p>\n<p>“(Marquez) threw well because he had to,” Rockies manager Bud Black told reporters in Chicago. “Their guy was really good. It was a pitcher’s duel, obviously, even in good conditions to hit. German settled in with a good breaking ball — the slider and the curve — and kept the ball down. Just a couple of mistakes.”</p>\n<p>Stroman, who entered the game 0-5 with a 7.11 ERA at Wrigley — the highest home ERA in the majors for pitchers with at least nine starts — dominated the Rockies. He pitched seven innings, allowing three hits, striking out five and walking two.</p>\n<p>“He had good movement on all of his pitches,” Black told reporters. “I think the fastball had life to it, with exceptional movement, which he has when he’s on.”</p>\n<p>McMahon, who’s started to hit with more power of late, launched Stroman’s 0-1, 93 mph sinker, 433 feet to center for his 17th homer of the season. The third baseman has hit safely in six of his last seven starts with three multi-hit games and four home runs.</p>\n<p>Marquez, coming off a poor start against Arizona at Coors Field where he gave up a season-high nine runs over just four innings, pitched seven innings, allowing two runs on six hits with two walks and our strikeouts. Marquez gave up one run in the first on a leadoff triple to Zach McKinstry, followed by an RBI single by Ian Happ. McKinstry’s solo home run in the fifth turned out to be the difference in the game.</p>\n<p>“My job was to keep the ball down, this is a small ballpark,” Marquez told AT&amp;t SportsNet. “I think I just missed a couple of pitches, but I feel good about my whole outing.”</p>\n<p>The Rockies slid to 22-48 on the road, a major-league worst .314 winning percentage that puts them on pace to finish the season with 25 wins away from Coors Field.</p>\n<p>Bryant update. Left-fielder Kris Bryant, who’s been on the injured list since Aug. 1 as he battles plantar fasciitis in his left foot, said he’s making progress, but there is no still timetable for his return. He’s played in just 42 games and the Rockies have just 18 games remaining in their season.</p>\n<p>“I feel much better than I have,” Bryant told reporters prior to Friday’s game. “I got the PRP (platelet-rich plasma) shot a couple of weeks ago and I never thought it would work as good as it has, so that’s a good feeling.</p>\n<p>“I’m finally able to do some baseball stuff. I ran for the first time today and it felt good so, hopefully, we’re kind of moving in the right direction.”</p>\n<p>Bryant, who played the first six-plus seasons of his career with the Cubs, was asked by Chicago media about his injury-filled season after signing a seven-year, $182 million contract with Colorado. He also was asked by members of the media from Chicago about living up to the seven-year, $182 million deal he signed in the offseason to join the Rockies.</p>\n<p>“I feel like I generally handle things pretty well,” Bryant said, according to Rox Pile. “You ask me that question while we’re at a place where we are today. I think playing here helped me handle certain expectations and pressures that this game brings.”</p>\n<p>Bryant said that 2023 has certainly been challenging.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a weird year for me, starting all the way back in November with things shut down (during the lockout) and then finding a team real quick, then being hurt and having twins,” he said. “Just a lot of life changes you know, but everybody here has been unbelievably supportive and I’ve established some really good relationships here. It’s going to help me in the future because I’m going to be here a while.”</p>\n<p>Davis called up. Right-hander Noah Davis was recalled from Double-A Hartford Friday, taking the roster spot left vacant when the Rockies released veteran right-hander Jhoulys Chacin on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Davis was 8-8 with a 5.54 ERA over 26 starts for the Yard Goats this season. He was obtained from the Reds during last year’s trade deadline. He has not made his big league debut yet.</p>\n<p>Black told MLB.com that Davis, 25, will be used out of the bullpen for the rest of this season but will compete for a rotation spot in spring training. Davis, however, is expected to begin the 2023 season at Triple-A Albuquerque.</p>\n\n<p>On Deck<br />\nRockies RHP Jose Urena (3-6, 5.81 ERA) at RHP Hayden Wesneski (1-1, 3.12)<br />\n12:20 p.m. Saturday, Wrigley Field<br />\nTV: AT&amp;T SportsNet<br />\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM</p>\n<p>Urena, in charge of his breaking ball for the first time in several starts, is coming off a solid outing against Arizona at Coors Field, allowing just one run across 5 1/3 innings, limiting the Diamondbacks to five hits while striking out five and walking two. He last faced the Cubs on April 9 as a reliever for the Brewers, pitching 1 1/3 scoreless innings, though he did walk three. In eight career games (seven starts) vs. Chicago, he’s 2-2 with a 4.58 ERA.</p>\n<p>Hayden, who made his big-league debut Sept. 6, will be facing the Rockies for the first time. He’s coming off a loss vs. San Francisco on Sunday when he gave up three runs on four hits (two home runs) in 3 2/3 innings. In his debut against Cincinnati, he became the first reliever in major league history (since 1901) to debut with at least five scoreless innings, two hits or less surrendered and eight strikeouts. He was traded to the Cubs from the Yankees on Aug. 1 for right-hander Scott Effross.</p>\n<p>Trending:  Daniel Bard notched his 30th save of the season Wednesday against the White Sox. At age 37 years and 81 days old, Bard became the fourth-oldest player in major league history to reach 30 saves in a season for the first time.</p>\n<p>At Issue: Ryan McMahon’s solo home run on Friday was just the 41st homer hit by the Rockies on the road this season, by far the fewest road homers in the majors. Detroit has hit 47.</p>\n<p>Pitching probables:<br />\nSunday: Rockies RHP Ryan Feltner (2-8, 6.12) at Cubs RHP Javier Assad (1-1, 2.53), 12:20 p.m., ATTRM<br />\nMonday: Giants RHP Jakob Junis (4-6, 4.15) at Rockies RHP Chad Kuhl (6-9, 5.33), 6:40 p.m., ATTRM</p>",

        "link": "https://reason.com/volokh/2022/09/17/prof-david-ardia-guest-blogging-on-first-amendment-limits-on-state-laws-targeting-election-misinformation/",
        "description": "<p>I'm delighted to report that Prof. David Ardia (UNC) will be guest-blogging this week about this new article, which he cowrote with Evan Ringel (Park Doctoral Fellow at the UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media). The abstract:</p>\n<p>The last two presidential election cycles have brought increased attention to the extent of misinformation—and outright lies—peddled by political candidates, their surrogates, and others who seek to influence election outcomes. Given the ubiquity of this speech, especially online, one might assume that there are no laws against lying in politics. It turns out that the opposite is true. Although the federal government has largely stayed out of regulating the content of election-related speech, the states have been surprisingly active in passing laws that prohibit false statements associated with elections.</p>\n<p>Prompted by concern about the impact of misinformation on the American electorate, we set out to assess the extent to which existing state and federal laws limit election misinformation and the prospect that these laws will survive First Amendment scrutiny. In doing so, we reviewed more than 125 state statutes that regulate the content of election-related speech, ranging from statutes that prohibit false and misleading factual statements about candidates to laws that indirectly regulate election-related speech by prohibiting fraud and intimidation concerning elections.</p>\n<p>What we found is that state statutes regulating election misinformation vary widely in the types of speech they target and the level of fault they require, with many statutes suffering from serious constitutional deficiencies. Statutes that target defamatory speech or speech that harms the election process, is fraudulent, or that intimidates voters are likely to be permissible, while statutes that target other types of speech that have not traditionally been subject to government restriction, such as statutes that target merely derogatory speech, will face an uphill battle in demonstrating that they are constitutional. Furthermore, statutes that impose liability without regard to the speaker's knowledge of falsity or intent to interfere with an election are especially problematic.</p>\n<p>Political speech has long been viewed as residing at the core of the First Amendment's protections for speech. Yet it has become increasingly clear that lies and other forms of misinformation associated with elections are corrosive to democracy. The challenge, of course, is in developing regulatory regimes that advance the interest in free and fair elections while at the same time ensuring that debate on public issues remains uninhibited, robust, and wide-open. This is no easy task. Regardless of whether individual statutes survive First Amendment scrutiny, it is useful to understand the breadth and depth of state attempts to deal with lies, misinformation, intimidation, and fraud in elections. As we point out, any legislative approach to combatting election misinformation must be part of a broader societal effort to reduce the prevalence of misinformation generally and to mitigate the harms that such speech creates.</p>\n<p>The post Prof. David Ardia Guest-Blogging on \"First Amendment Limits on State Laws Targeting Election Misinformation\" appeared first on Reason.com.</p>",

        "description": "Listened VR, the metaverse and education by Edtech Innovators from anchor.fm\nThis episode, you are blessed to hear Ian Stuart talk to me about his journey from teaching on remote Scottish islands (Jura and Isla) to being an edtech innovator.. On his Twitter @IanStuart66, it says this: Formerly an Engineer, then an Educator, Consultant, Microsoft Edu. Now Head of Education with @AvantisEd. \n\n<p>I listened to VR, the metaverse and education by Edtech Innovators which interviewed my pal Ian Stuart.</p>\n<p>Apart for a little dip into Google Expeditions a few years back (eek!) I’ve not really paid much attention to VR.</p>\n<p>Of course I’ve read a lot of tweets from Ian who is now working in the VR field, but not dug in. So I was interested to listen Ian talking on this podcast. It is well worth a listen, a quick 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>I liked the way Ian linked VR to his previous use of technology. Ian insisted that the technology should be developed in response to classroom needs as opposed to the repurposing of business software. Ian had some nice examples of the use of VR and touched upon its use as part of project based learning.</p>\n<p>Ian also mentioned an experience from his Islay past, when project based learning needed a fair bit of scaffolding to get off the ground.</p>\n<p>VR does not come naturally to me. I did see how engaging it was for my class using Google cardboard back in 2016. We didn’t have the time to get past engaging to learning but Ian explained some of the ways it could be added to real learning.</p>\n<p>Ian pointed to Eduverse The World’s First K-12 Metaverse  where there is a fair bit of free content to explore even without a headset. I’ve only had a short browse in my browser, but I think I’ll see how well it runs on our iPads on the school network.</p>\nSide notes:\n\nOne of the things that puts me off is word Metaverse, it is so linked to Facebook I naturally balk.\nAnchor/Spotify is a pain to winkle podcasts out of. I add episodes of show I want to listen to, as opposed to sub to the whole series, with Huffduffer, it relies on an mp3 being linked to in the episode.\nIan should have had a blog for all these years he has been involved in interesting things.",

        "description": "Listened VR, the metaverse and education by Edtech Innovators from anchor.fm\nThis episode, you are blessed to hear Ian Stuart talk to me about his journey from teaching on remote Scottish islands (Jura and Isla) to being an edtech innovator.. On his Twitter @IanStuart66, it says this: Formerly an Engineer, then an Educator, Consultant, Microsoft Edu. Now Head of Education with @AvantisEd. \n\n<p>I listened to VR, the metaverse and education by Edtech Innovators which interviewed my pal Ian Stuart.</p>\n<p>Apart for a little dip into Google Expeditions a few years back (eek!) I’ve not really paid much attention to VR.</p>\n<p>Of course I’ve read a lot of tweets from Ian who is now working in the VR field, but not dug in. So I was interested to listen Ian talking on this podcast. It is well worth a listen, a quick 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>I liked the way Ian linked VR to his previous use of technology. Ian insisted that the technology should be developed in response to classroom needs as opposed to the repurposing of business software. Ian had some nice examples of the use of VR and touched upon its use as part of project based learning.</p>\n<p>Ian also mentioned an experience from his Islay past, when project based learning needed a fair bit of scaffolding to get off the ground.</p>\n<p>VR does not come naturally to me. I did see how engaging it was for my class using Google cardboard back in 2016. We didn’t have the time to get past engaging to learning but Ian explained some of the ways it could be added to real learning.</p>\n<p>Ian pointed to Eduverse The World’s First K-12 Metaverse  where there is a fair bit of free content to explore even without a headset. I’ve only had a short browse in my browser, but I think I’ll see how well it runs on our iPads on the school network.</p>\nSide notes:\n\nOne of the things that puts me off is word Metaverse, it is so linked to Facebook I naturally balk.\nAnchor/Spotify is a pain to winkle podcasts out of. I add episodes of show I want to listen to, as opposed to sub to the whole series, with Huffduffer, it relies on an mp3 being linked to in the episode.\nIan should have had a blog for all these years he has been involved in interesting things.",

Hope you all had a fantastic week doing something other than watching the Diamondbacks get destroyed pretty much every day since the last episode! I know I have! The Diamondbacks must have liked some of your suggestions for what they should do in the offseason, cause they sure seem to be trying to get there faster now...</p>\n<p>Lots of red entries this week, which I always love to see. Even our third place contestant this week brings a red comment to the podium with them, and that third place winner is SpencerSpice with 4 recs!</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>Is that what I’m doing wrong with growing my beard out? I’ve got to try some of those meat balls...</p>\n<p>In third place, we find NikT77 and gzimmerm with 5 recs each!</p>\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n<p>Sometimes the answers just write themselves folks!</p>\n<p>And rounding out our podium this week is kilnborn with 6 recs!</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>Sadly, I think the day of two sport athletes has come and gone, but this sure would be cool to see...</p>\n<p>With that second place finish, NikT77 moves into first place with a five rec lead, which I believe is the biggest lead so far in the second half! gzimmerm slides to third place, just six points behind Nik and a single point behind Jack for second place. With just two more prompts left this season, it’s going to be a tight race to see who joins Jack in the Finale this season!</p>\n\n<p>For better or for worse, and whether we like it or not, MLB is making a lot of changes to the game we all know and love. We’ve already addressed rule changes this season, so let’s take a different route. Another focus of change has been the playoff format, with the playoffs being fairly significantly expanded and a whole new series being added to the postseason. But this new format still requires the teams to play the games, which too many people find boring and cumbersome. Your challenge this week is to come up with a new and exciting way to determine which of the playoff teams is named the World Champion. Go!</p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who sees things this way:</p>\n<p>Stubbornly high inflation has Wall Street worried that the Federal Reserve will respond by raising interest rates until the United States tumbles into recession, taking the weakening global economy with it.</p>\n<p>The Fed and other central banks are tightening credit to fight historically high inflation even as three of the world’s main economic engines — the United States, Europe and China — are sputtering.</p>\n<p>....“I don’t really get the sense that many or any central banks are paying huge attention to how their policies are affecting the rest of the world,” said Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California at Berkeley, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.</p>\n<p>Here's a quick summary of the US economy since the start of 2022:</p>\n<p>Labor force participation is up slightly, but everything else is down. And have I mentioned that the yield curve inverted a month ago?</p>\n<p>The global economy is not booming or overheated. It's in rickety shape, and right now it needs help. It's already started to roll down a hill on its own and the last thing it needs a big push to get it barreling over everything in its path.</p>\n<p>And one other thing. Larry Summers says that no one really understands inflation, and at least in the modern US context he's right. In fact, it's worse than that. Take a look at this long-term chart showing the inflation rate over the 70 years since the end of Korean War:</p>\n<p>In this entire period there has been only one major inflationary episode aside from our current one: 1973-83. We know what caused that one, and we know—or think we know—that big interest rate increases and a sharp recession were the only cure.</p>\n<p>But that's it: In the US for the past 70 years, we have n=1. And even that single n is nothing like our current situation, which was fundamentally caused by a global pandemic and its effect on supply chains and business lockdowns. We don't have any experience at all to tell us the best response to this, so instead we're doing what we always do: looking back at the '70s and panicking that it's happening all over again. Don't do what Richard Nixon and Arthur Burns did! It took Paul Volcker to fix that!</p>\n<p>But we're not doing that. This time around there's no Nixon, no Burns, and no circumstances even remotely like the one they created. But we're putting out the call for the Volcker playbook anyway. Why? A little humility would go a long way right now.</p>\n<p>POSTSCRIPT: John Maynard Keynes allegedly warned that \"The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\" He was talking about asset bubbles, but the same idea is true of other things. Team Transitory originally thought that our current round of inflation would last a few months, and when it kept going beyond that they gave up and decided we must be replaying the '70s.</p>\n<p>I doubt it. I just think that things like inflationary episodes (and pandemics) can last longer than you think. This is why I remain stubbornly on Team Transitory. At most the Fed should be slowly and calmly raising interest rates. At best they should probably be doing nothing while we wait to get a better idea of how everything is going to play out. After all, inflation is already subsiding before anything they've done has had any effect, and I'll bet it will continue to. But watch out for 2023 when all those interest rate hikes suddenly kick in just when we don't need them.</p>\n\nFacebook  \nTwitter \nEmail\nPrint",

After all, if your opposition has to dip into their bullpen early, it restricts what they can do in the second game.</p>\n<p>The Twins elected not to adhere to this maxim, and Cleveland ace Shane Bieber did ace-like things, tossing eight brilliant, economical innings, and setting up the Guards to knock their second-closest rival down another peg.</p>\n<p>Louis Varland was greeted by a Jose Ramirez bomb in the first inning to set the tone. The momentum — if you believe in such a thing — was on Cleveland’s side from the get-go, as the Guardians received quick innings on defense and got to work scoring early against Minnesota.</p>\n<p>Amed Rosario would add another run for the home team with a third-inning single; Owen Miller singled in two more in the fourth — the same inning in which the Twins finally recorded their first hit off Shane Bieber.</p>\n<p>It was a dominant performance from Cleveland’s two-time All-Star, who was tagged just once in what wound up being the most interesting storyline of the afternoon. In his major-league debut, Matt Wallner launched a deep solo shot into the right-center bleachers, notching the first knock of his MLB career in majestic fashion.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Much to the chagrin of the TV booth, the Cleveland fan who caught the ball went on to engage in a multi-inning negotiation period that dominated the rest of the telecast for lack of anything better to watch. The negotiation involved Twins personnel, stadium security, and text messages from Justin Morneau, and was not yet finished at the time of the game’s conclusion.</p>\n<p>According to Dan Hayes, the reason for the hitch appeared to be that the fan was requesting something out of the scope of the Twins organization:</p>\n\n\n<p>Heard the fan with the Matt Wallner home run ball wants a Matt Wallner signed bat and to throw out a first pitch at a #Guardians game. Twins have no control over the latter.#MNTwins</p>— DanHayesMLB (@DanHayesMLB) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>It was a smooth top of the ninth for Emmanuel Clase, who was tabbed by manager Terry Francona to return to close things out after finishing last night’s ballgame.</p>\n  \n        \n      \nCOURTESY: Baseball Savant\n  \n<p>In the most crucial stretch of the 2022 season, the Twins have lost five straight head-to-head matchups with the Cleveland Guardians, who open their lead over Minnesota to six games, and their lead over the Chicago White Sox to 4.5.</p>\n<p>The Twins will need to win tonight to return to where they were just hours ago.</p>\n<p>STUDS:</p>\n<p>RF Matt Wallner (1-for-3, R, RBI, HR)</p>\n<p>DUDS:</p>\n<p>Most</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>See you in a bit!</p>",

        "description": "<p>BELGRADE — Gloomy weather and pouring rain — coupled with weeks of institutional hurdles and nationalist threats — did not stop the EuroPride parade from filling central Belgrade with rainbow-colored umbrellas and bright raincoats on Saturday evening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is the most important EuroPride that’s been held in 30 years. The banning and un-banning of the Pride, the terrible opposition it has faced from the government and ministries and political parties in the last few days makes its importance clear,” the president of EuroPride, Kristine Garina, told POLITICO Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only Saturday morning did the Serbian government give the go-ahead for the parade, following weeks of controversy and international pressure after President Aleksandar Vučić canceled the event last month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With rainbow flags tied around their shoulders — or even used as shields from the rain — the participants in the march hugged each other and spoke in elated tones as more and more people gathered in front of the Constitutional Court in Belgrade. The decision to start the parade in front of the court was emblematic of the decades-long fight of LGBT activists in Serbia to secure legal rights for their events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“With EuroPride, our goal is to bring more international attention and to get European commissioners and parliamentarians involved,” Garina said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least two dozen European politicians attended the parade, including the EU commissioner for equality, Helena Dalli, and MEP Vladimir Bilcik — who said in his capacity as the European Parliament’s rapporteur for Serbia that the challenges EuroPride faced in Belgrade will leave a significant mark on the country’s annual report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In late August, President Vučić announced his intention to cancel the pan-European pro-LGBT event due to ongoing political tensions between Serbia and Kosovo, sparking outrage in Serbian society as well as among EU representatives. Vučić later tried to counter the criticism over the cancellation by claiming that he has a lesbian family member and would “never disown her despite those who want to beat her up.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Far-right groups held protests and Eastern Orthodox religious processions — known as litije — ahead of the scheduled parade date and protested en masse on Saturday chanting “Kill the gays” and throwing flares at the police on one of the main boulevards in Belgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a communal prayer last Sunday, Patriarch Porfirije, head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, said EuroPride was “desecrating traditional family values” and promoting “unnatural unions as a substitute for marriage.”</p>\n\n\n\nThe parade went ahead despite controversy | Andreea Campeanu/Getty Images\n\n\n\n<p>The parade itself had to be heavily cordoned by riot police. At one point, hooligans and anti-Pride protesters charged the police with sticks and batons as clashes were witnessed along the route. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The government said 5,200 workers from the ministry of internal affairs, mainly police officers, were on the scene to maintain security. More than 60 people were arrested and 10 police officers were injured, it said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the parade on Saturday, upbeat music blaring from moving speakers was mixed with threatening chants from the sidelines, where a combination of nationalist and religious protesters gathered and held up anti-Pride banners as well as wooden crosses and images of Serbian Orthodox religious icons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Church bells were rung in opposition to the parade from St. Mark’s, the main Orthodox church along the route.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We always knew it would be difficult, but what we witnessed goes beyond the level we expected. This was the first time we faced such intense conspiracy theories and opposition,” Garina said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Serbia has faced continuous criticism since the renewed invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February, particularly because it refuses to apply sanctions against Moscow despite being an EU candidate country and for allowing rhetoric similar to that promoted by Putin to be promoted in mainstream media outlets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The head of the far-right Zavetnici, or Oathkeepers, party, Milica Đurđević Stamenkovski, which is currently part of the Serbian parliament, said that the last-minute decision of President Vučić and Prime Minister Ana Brnabic to allow the Pride parade to take place is “proof that foreign ambassadors are above the laws of our country.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers of the parade have been accused by many in Serbia — including the pro-government media — of acting under the influence of the West. Garina said the “organizers and activists put together a monumental effort” in the face of such opposition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>The Royals announced today that outfielder Edward Olivares was reinstated from the 60-day injured list, with first baseman Nick Pratto getting optioned in a corresponding move. Olivares went on the IL in mid-July due to a left quad strain. The club already had a vacancy on its 40-man roster, meaning no corresponding move was required in that department.</p>\n<p>The injury was ill-timed for Olivares, 26, as he seemed on the verge of a breakout prior to that. In 36 games this year, he’s hit .303/.358/.434 for a 125 wRC+. With just over two weeks remaining until the offseason, he will try to get back into a groove and go into the winter with a strong finish. He’ll jump into the outfield mix with Michael A. Taylor, Drew Waters, Kyle Isbel, Hunter Dozier and Nate Eaton, with catcher MJ Melendez occasionally heading onto the grass as well.</p>\n<p>Other injury updates from around the league…</p>\n\nThe Reds announced that right-hander Hunter Greene was reinstated from the 15-day injured list. He is slated to start the second game of today’s doubleheader. Fellow righty Raynel Espinal was optioned in a corresponding move, while righty Kyle Dowdy is serving as the “29th man” for the twin bill. One of the top prospects in the game coming into this year, Greene hasn’t exactly been dominant in his MLB debut. He has a 5.26 ERA through his first 102 2/3 innings in the big leagues, though with a very strong 28.8% strikeout rate. Since the Reds have traded away established pitchers like Sonny Gray, Luis Castillo and Tyler Mahle this year, they will need the prospects to step up and form the core of the next rotation. It’s possible there’s already a decent nucleus in place, with Greene, Nick Lodolo and Graham Ashcraft all showing some signs of promise this year.\nThe Phillies have been without Zack Wheeler for almost a month but he could return this week without a rehab assignment, reports Matt Gelb of The Athletic. The tentative plan is for the righty to start Wednesday’s game against the Blue Jays, though probably not for very long. His most recent work was throwing two innings in a simulated game, which he will be gradually building on over the final two weeks of the regular season. As Gelb notes, Wheeler could potentially be lined up to start the first game of the Wild Card playoff round, but the Phils will have to make it there first. The club is in decent position to make the postseason since they are currently in possession of the second of three NL Wild Card spots, 1.5 games ahead of the Padres and 3 ahead of the Brewers. Getting Wheeler back will be tremendously helpful, assuming he doesn’t have any rust from his absence. Through 138 innings on the season, he has a 3.07 ERA, 26.7% strikeout rate, 5.9% walk rate and 44.1% ground ball rate.",

        "description": "<p>A former White House aide told the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack that Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) sought a pardon from former President Trump over the Department of Justice's (DOJ) investigation into sex trafficking allegations against him, The Washington Post reported on Saturday, citing sources familiar with the testimony.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former Trump aide Johnny McEntee said Gaetz told him he had asked former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows for a preemptive pardon, the Post reported. McEntee told the committee that he understood the pardon to be in connection with the DOJ probe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Justice Department is investigating allegations that Gaetz paid for sex, paid for women to travel across state lines to have sex and had a sexual relationship with a minor. Gaetz denies the allegations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The committee previously showed McEntee saying in a videotaped deposition that Gaetz told him he asked Meadows for a pardon during a June hearing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also presented testimony from other former Trump aides naming Gaetz as one of several Republican lawmakers who sought pardons from Trump. Gaetz and Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) advocated for a \"blanket pardon\" for lawmakers who participated in a December 2020 meeting where efforts to overturn the election were discussed, former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson testified. When asked by the committee if Gaetz was seeking a pardon, Eric Herschmann, a former Trump White House attorney, responded in a taped deposition that he believed so and that Gaetz's pardon request was “for any and all things.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), a member of the committee, also presented an email from Brooks in which the Alabama congressman requested presidential pardons for himself, Gaetz, and lawmakers who objected to the Electoral College vote for Arizona and Pennsylvania.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, McEntee’s testimony as reported by the Post is the first to indicate that Gaetz sought a pardon in connection with the Justice Department’s investigation into the sex trafficking allegations, though there has been speculation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The New York Times reported in April 2021 that Gaetz had sought a blanket pardon from Trump in the last weeks of his presidency, noting this came as the congressman was being investigated by the DOJ for allegedly violating sex trafficking laws. Trump denied the allegations that Gaetz had directly asked for a blanket pardon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Congressman Matt Gaetz discussed pardons for many other people publicly and privately at the end of President Donald Trump’s first term,” a spokesperson for Gaetz said in a statement. “As for himself, President Trump addressed this malicious rumor more than a year ago stating, ‘Congressman Matt Gaetz has never asked me for a pardon.’ Rep. Gaetz continues to stand by President Trump’s statement.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Jan. 6 committee and Trump's team did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/3647635-yeshiva-v-yu-pride-alliance-and-its-tax-exempt-status-backstory/",
        "description": "<p>The Supreme Court’s Wednesday ruling upholding, for now, a New York judge’s decision requiring Yeshiva University to officially recognize an LGBTQ+ student group keeps the New York City school at the intersection between separate legal precedents: On one hand religious entities have sovereignty over matters related to their religious teachings. On the other, government has effectively exercised authority against discrimination on college campuses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The case is expected to go before a New York state appeals court. Meanwhile, Yeshiva, which describes itself in the court filing as a “deeply religious Jewish university,” is required to designate YU Pride Alliance as a bona fide campus organization. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At issue is the distinction of Yeshiva University as a “school” by virtue of its charter in New York and not as a religious institution, which otherwise might be better able to sustain its objections on religious grounds. As a school, however, Yeshiva is not in compliance with the New York City Human Rights Law, which prohibits discrimination based on “actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeshiva had asked the Supreme Court to overrule the lower court on the theory that religious protection under the First Amendment should override that human rights law. In the filing, the university calls the LGBTQ club a “government-enforced establishment” that is “irreparably damaging” to what the school calls its religious mission. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawyers representing the student group said a previous court had already “correctly ruled” that Yeshiva must grant equal accommodations to all students on campus and called it “disheartening” that Yeshiva will not join other major religiously affiliated universities to allow LGBTQ students to create safe spaces for themselves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind the scenes of this case is the tax-exempt status of the school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Officially a 501c3 charitable organization, Yeshiva adheres to the status as a school for its public charity recognition. While this tax-exemption status is not inherently any different than meeting any other charitable cause within 501c3, it does afford the school access to governmental grants and advantages to their students, for example, access to student loan programs and tax credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now tax-exempt schools are bound by a prior Supreme Court decision, Bob Jones University v. United States, 461 U.S. 574 (1983). In that case the Supreme Court adopted the “Public Policy Doctrine” denying Bob Jones University tax-exemption due to racially discriminatory policies that it had at the time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, the Supreme Court there upheld the IRS’s position that entitlement to tax exemption depends on meeting certain common law standards of charity and public policy not specified by Congress when it enacted Section 501(c)(3).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A key element in this ruling is recognition of the concept that tax-exemption is not a fundamental right but rather a status granted to organizations that serve the public good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That decision underlined that tax exempt 501(c)(3) organizations must serve a charitable public purpose in the common law sense and cannot be operated in a manner contrary to established public policy. The Court noted that over the previous 25 years, every Supreme Court decision and many federal statutes and executive orders displayed a firm national policy to prohibit racial segregation and discrimination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should be noted that prior to 1970, universities were routinely granted tax exemptions as educational institutions despite having admissions policies that were racially discriminatory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An IRS revision of tax regulations in 1970 began to require that universities have admissions policies that were not racially discriminatory to qualify for tax exemption under Section 501(c)(3).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 1983 Bob Jones University case revoking that school’s tax-exemption, the Supreme Court concluded that the government has a fundamental overriding interest in eradicating racial discrimination in education, and that this interest substantially outweighs whatever burden the denial of tax benefit places on the University’s exercise of religious beliefs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, the Supreme Court held that the University’s policies practicing racial discrimination were contrary to established public policy and the IRS’s revocation of Section 501(c)(3) tax exemption was warranted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the Bob Jones case concentrated on racial discrimination, the Supreme Court focused more on matters of public policy. As a result, it has been academically pondered as to whether the doctrine of marriage equality is a matter of fundamental public policy. Obergefell v. Hodges found that government prohibition of same-sex marriage is unconstitutional on equal protection and due process grounds and has seemingly been widely accepted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since this ruling, 501(c)(3) organizations that oppose marriage equality based on religious grounds wonder whether their exemptions are now at risk for challenge by the IRS under the Public Policy Doctrine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bob Jones case does not provide the IRS with discretion to make judgment calls on what is and is not public policy. The Court noted that all branches of government were in unanimous agreement regarding this national policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, many of the cases striking down racial discrimination were unanimous (Brown v. Board of Education, Loving v. Virginia). Splitting the hairs of what is in unanimous agreement from a public policy standpoint is never so clear, so where should the line be drawn?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notwithstanding, the Bob Jones case specifically excluded churches and purely religious 501(c)(3) organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This underlines, again, the challenges involved in conferring the status of a “school.” Without that status, Yeshiva would not be entitled to certain other government programs and advantages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, with that status, they may find themselves at a crossroads between their inherent religious tenants and freedoms deemed important by most of society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samuel Handwerger, CPA, is a full-time lecturer in the Accounting and Information Assurance Department at the University of Maryland’s Robert H.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/technology/3646920-how-state-attorneys-general-are-leading-the-fight-against-big-tech/",
        "description": "<p>State attorneys general are leading efforts to crack down on the power of big technology firms, as highlighted by California's suit filed this week against Amazon and a Texas-led coalition's measured win in its fight against Google. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cases are just two in a long line of state-led efforts to rein in the power of tech giants that are showcasing the bipartisan angst at Big Tech and momentum on the state level to take on the industry's most dominant companies while congressional efforts to do so are stalled. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Whether you're Republican or Democrat, people can see what's going on with these big companies, Big Tech companies and the power and the levers that they exert over everyday Americans, is a little bit scary,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) told The Hill. “I think people are realizing, the attorneys general are realizing, that if we don't address this soon it may be too late, you may never be able to stop it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly every state is suing Google and Meta, Facebook’s parent company, between three cases filed against the companies in the past two years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unified efforts help state enforcers pool their resources to give them a chance against the mammoth firms. But they’re still facing an uphill battle to take on the country’s most prosperous businesses while using a rulebook critics say is outdated to go after the new age industry titans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It gives them more ground troops to fight for battle,” said Bill Baer, former head of the Department of Justice Antitrust Division and former director of the Federal Trade Commission Bureau of Competition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It's still very, very expensive, and the cost of hiring outside experts to come in and do economic analysis, and analysis of the technology, is enormously resource intensive and expensive,” he added. “Coordinating or banding together as a group of enforcers helps with that problem. They still are outpersoned, and don't have the dollars that a private company — a successful private company — has at its disposal, but it does come closer to leveling the playing field.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser (D), who is leading one of the multistate cases against Google, is no stranger to the antitrust enforcement world. He served in the Department of Justice (DOJ) antitrust division under the Obama administration. But he said he didn’t necessarily plan on actively enforcing antitrust laws when he assumed his role as Colorado attorney general in 2019. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It was more that the issues [rose in] importance,” he said. “And it was obviously not just me — states across the nation have seen … levels of concentration today that are manifestly unhealthy. And what that means is consumers are more vulnerable to being squeezed.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The case Weiser is leading was branded as a bipartisan effort from the start. Weiser was joined by Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson (R), Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery (R) and Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller (D) in December 2020 when they announced the case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lawsuit alleges Google illegally maintains monopoly power over search engines and search advertising markets through anticompetitive contracts. Google has denied the allegations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The states further contend Google is trying to expand its alleged monopoly in the mobile market into new sectors, like the automobile industry, as search becomes integrated into more products.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The idea is if you have a connected car and you say to your car, ‘Find me a Chinese restaurant,’ what powers that search? Google is entering into restrictive contracts with carmakers that basically mirror the restrictive contracts they've had in mobile,” Weiser told The Hill.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We obviously are looking forward. The last decade things happened as they happened. There's going to be some second guessing, ‘Could antitrust enforcers have acted sooner?’ What I would just say is, you're always in a delicate position when you're dealing with markets in their incipient [stage],” he added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google’s market power in advertising is targeted in a separate case led by Paxton. The coalition of 16 states and Puerto Rico that filed that lawsuit had a win earlier this week when a judge ruled to allow most of the case to proceed, striking down just one portion of the case that alleged collusion based on an advertising deal between Google and Facebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, e-commerce giant Amazon is emerging as the latest target for state antitrust enforcement action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta (D) sued Amazon Wednesday, alleging the company has stifled competition and caused higher prices for consumers over anticompetitive contracts with third-party sellers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine (D) made similar allegations in a case tossed out by a judge in March. Racine filed a notice of appeal last month in an attempt to revive the case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What we've seen is that they exercise massive market power on the platform to make it nearly impossible for sellers and creators of products and services to offer prices at a lower price than Amazon does because of the restrictions that Amazon mandates that sellers comply with in order to have access to their platform,” Racine told The Hill. “We think that is illegal and we are confident that at the end of the day a court will agree with us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon denied the allegations in both the D.C. and California cases. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Meta, 48 attorneys general filed a lawsuit against the company in December 2020 in an attempt to unwind roughly decade-old acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram that the complaint alleges were an attempt to squash emerging rival apps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meta has denied the allegations, and noted that regulators approved the acquisitions at the time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Issues on timing are a key factor in antitrust cases, Weiser said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Critics can't have it both ways. They can't say, ‘Oh, you're too quick to see a monopoly everywhere. You're bringing cases right and left based on what you think might happen.’ And then to say, which is what's happening and Instagram and WhatsApp, ‘Oh, you're too late,’” he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>States have been struggling in their case against Meta. A judge ruled to dismiss the case last year, arguing the states filed the complaint too late against the 2012 and 2014 acquisitions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>State attorneys general filed a motion to appeal in January. A hearing on their appeal is scheduled for Monday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These efforts by state enforcers — as well as those of federal regulatory agencies — to sue tech giants come as critics argue antitrust laws need to be updated to target the technology companies. For example, proposals to update the laws use language to define dominant firms in part based on the number of users, a factor that could help legislation apply to the modern-day titans operating in the digital world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Congress has been mulling legislative action to revamp antitrust laws to better address the tech industry since the release of a wide-ranging House report in 2020 alleging Amazon, Google, Apple and Meta, then known as Facebook, stifled competition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report led to a series of bipartisan bills to update antitrust laws in a way that supporters say better suits the modern age. For example, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) are lead sponsors of the American Innovation and Online Choice Act, which aims to prohibit companies from preferencing their products over rivals', a core allegation in state complaints against companies like Google and Amazon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even the proposals on the issue that have advanced out of Senate and House Judiciary Committees with bipartisan support are stalled without a floor vote scheduled in either chamber ahead of fast approaching midterm elections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think it's important that Congress step up and modernize the laws and create better protections for consumers and residents and Americans,” Racine said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Part of the reason for being behind [other countries] is this assumption that we have in Congress where there's just total gridlock,” he added. “And in that breach it's incumbent on attorneys general to step up and use all the tools in the toolbox, including lawsuits and other actions, in order to ensure that residents are protected.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>DFL Gov. Tim Walz is ahead of Republican challenger Scott Jensen by seven percentage points with less than two months to go in their race, according to a new MPR News/Star Tribune/KARE 11 Minnesota Poll that also shows a majority approves of the incumbent’s job performance.</p><p> The Walz lead over Jensen stands at 48 to 41 percent. </p><p>Ten percent told the Mason Dixon Polling and Strategy firm that they hadn’t made up their minds and a tiny fraction said they would opt for a third-party candidate. </p><p>It gives Jensen, a doctor and former state senator, room to catch Walz if he can convince virtually all of the undecideds to come his way. </p><p>The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points in the poll of 800 registered voters conducted September 12-14.</p><p>Meanwhile, about 52 percent say they approve of how Walz has done his job. That’s a better showing than Democratic President Joe Biden, who got a positive mark from just 46 percent and was viewed negatively by 49 percent. The rest were unsure. </p><p>Walz has been at the helm through a pandemic, civil unrest and a roller coaster economy.</p><p>“I think he's a straight shooter. And he's done a good job,” said Mike Casey of Duluth, who was among respondents willing to be interviewed by a reporter after answering the poll. </p><p>“Through the pandemic, I felt he was very transparent. He did a lot of work to try to keep us as safe as we could. They say you vote for who you like, not necessarily everything else,” Casey said. “He just really comes across to me as an upstanding gentleman and doing a great job. And besides that, his opponent is just the complete opposite who might ever consider being a governor.”</p><p>Mary Williamson of Carver opposes Walz and the actions he took during COVID-19.</p><p>“All I would see from Walz was more pressing in on school closings, and ‘Oh, isn't this a shame and boy we're trying hard.’ He was on soap boxes every day with you know, the education people, and it was awful,” Williamson said, adding that she trusts Jensen and is aligned with his values.</p><p>Williamson said her children and others shouldn’t have been kept out of school buildings for as long as they were. </p><p>“My children have suffered. I mean, suffered. And the children of the state have suffered. And I cannot support a man who just looks blindly into the eyes of this whole state and refused to stand up for what was right,” she said of Walz. “I cannot back him. I cannot. He’s a hot mess.”</p><p>The poll asked about the top issues for voters: Nearly a third of poll respondents said jobs and the economy. That was followed by crime and abortion at about 24 percent and 22 percent respectively. But Walz and Jensen supporters ranked those concerns in different orders.</p><p>Walz has a 20 point lead among women while Jensen has an edge about half that size among men. </p><p>A Minnesota governor hasn’t been booted by voters since 1990. How incumbents fare depends to a big degree on the case they make for themselves and the case their opponent makes against them.</p><p>“I think my biggest thing is with Walz,” said poll respondent Monica Nelson of Prior Lake.</p><p>She said she intends to vote for Jensen, in part because she’s upset with Walz. She said the governor reacted tentatively to the upheaval following George Floyd’s killing by police.</p><p>“And I don't like the way that he handled the Lake Street incident,” Nelson said. “They didn't follow protocol. Protocol for anything like that was all hands on deck.”</p><p>But Walz and allies are using millions of dollars in TV ads to hammer Jensen. They’ve criticized him for comments he’s made on education funding and limiting abortion access.</p><p>The messages around abortion have resonated with Nadine Garcia of Crystal, whose vote for Walz would be as much a vote against Jensen.</p><p>“It's more about preventing what Scott Jensen would do to me. I haven't had much chance to be too caught up in politics recently when it comes to the tighter elections, the more local ones,” Garcia said. “But I am very worried about making sure we still have a right to our own bodies.”</p><p>If Walz prevails, it would be the fourth straight term of a Democratic governor — something that hasn’t happened since Minnesota achieved statehood in 1858.</p><p>He’d also have to overcome voter perceptions of Biden, whose approval rating is considerably lower than the 52 percent vote share he had in Minnesota in 2020.</p><p>Biden’s standing is one factor in the election environment that could determine who controls Congress and the state Legislature. The party of first-term presidents often struggle in the midterm election.</p><p>Nikhil Joglekar of West St. Paul is willing to give Biden the benefit of the doubt despite the ongoing pandemic and persistent inflation.</p><p>“Honestly, what else would you do? I mean, like the Federal Reserve is doing what they can do right now. They're probably going to increase rates again next week,” Joglekar said. “And I think that President Biden is doing a really good job, you know, in light of all the challenges.”</p><p>For additional findings from the September MPR News/Star Tribune/KARE 11 Minnesota Poll, including notes about methodology and sample characteristics, see https://www.apmresearchlab.org/minnesota-poll-sept-2022 </p>",

        "description": "Photo by Abbie Parr/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>With two weeks left in the season, the Royals are still making questionable roster moves.</p> <p>Good afternoon. Before we get to the matchups I wanted to mention the roster move the Royals made earlier today. Edward Olivares is finally returned from the IL. That’s good! Before he got hurt this year, he was hitting well and his defense isn’t going to get any better if he doesn’t play. Unfortunately, to make room on the roster for Olivares the Royals chose to demote first baseman and outfielder Nick Pratto back to Omaha.</p>\n<p>Pratto was struggling a bit at the big league level, it’s true. Still, it seems unlikely that he has much more work to do at the AAA level. The simplest way for him to improve would be for him to reduce his strikeout rate. But that’s been a problem throughout his career. Going back to AAA and seeing worse pitchers doesn’t seem likely to significantly impact things. Pratto also had the second-highest ISO on the team, behind only Salvador Perez. So it’s not like he wasn’t finding some successes, too.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, fan-favorite punching bags Ryan O’Hearn and Hunter Dozier are both still on the big league roster. It’s true that neither of them is striking out as often as Pratto but it’s also true that between them they’ve hit one home run (Dozier, July 31) since Pratto was promoted - and in more combined total at-bats. Nick Pratto has been worth -0.3 fWAR since his promotion, which isn’t good, but Hunter Dozier has been worth an astonishing -1.4 fWAR over the same period. Dozier now has a career negative fWAR despite his excellent 2019 campaign.</p>\n<p>It’s safe to say at this point that Nick Pratto might have a future on this team while Dozier and O’Hearn should not. But the latter two will finish the year on the big league roster and Pratto will not.</p>\n<p>As for the matchups, Brady Singer is pitching today, so that bodes well for the Royals. The Red Sox are sending out Rich Hill. Hill is in his 18th season at age 42. He has a 2-2 career record against the Royals with an ERA of 5.76. He made two starts against them last year and gave up six runs in ten innings. He can be beaten.</p>\nLineups\n\n\n<p>Here's how we're taking the field behind Brady Singer this afternoon vs. the Red Sox.#TogetherRoyal pic.twitter.com/ukd0AJ09Ws</p>— Kansas City Royals (@Royals) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Our Saturday plans: pic.twitter.com/cwMz3jgGdv</p>— Red Sox (@RedSox) September 17, 2022",

        "description": "Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Just keep winning</p> <p>Anything can happen, but the future is firmly in the Guardians’ own hands. With mere weeks of the season left, all they have to do is continue to win games and they will be playing extended baseball in October. If Game 1 of today’s doubleheader against the Twins is any indication, they are prepared to do just that.</p>\n<p>Today’s scoring started with José Ramírez hitting a ball 421 feet in the first inning. The swagger that followed is indescribable. </p>\n\n<p>At 107 mph it was the hardest hit ball of the day, and it wouldn’t be the last one the Guardians offense blasted. Amed Rosario, Josh Naylor, Myles Straw, Oscar Gonzalez, and Andrés Giménez all registered at least one hit scored at over 100 mph, and only two didn’t fall for hits. </p>\n<p>Rosario’s four hits extended his hitting streak to a modest four games, but he appears to be heating up at just the right time after a slow start to September. The same goes for Owen Miller (nine-game hitting streak) and Straw (five-game hitting streak). The hitters you’d expect to hit are hitting, and everyone else is humming along, too. This is exactly what you want to see out of your baseball team down the stretch. </p>\n<p>The Guardians offense struck out just four times combined and drew three walks. Everyone but Austin Hedges recorded at least one base hit, and Straw drew a pair of walks in addition to his sixth-inning single. </p>\n<p>The numerous hard hits were nice, but the Guardians story of the day was pitching, namely Shane Bieber absolutely shutting the Twins down for most of eight innings. His only blemish was a cutter that didn’t cut enough and gave Matt Wallner a home run in his first career game. He was brilliant otherwise: 8.0 innings, six strikeouts, no walks, and four hits. He was in line for a Maddux until the homer and still finished with only 93 pitches before Terry Francona made the call to go Emmanuel Clase in the ninth inning of a 5-1 game. </p>\n<p>That seems weird on the surface, but I’m having a hard time getting too worked up about it. Plenty of times we’ve seen Tito leave a starter in too long, panic, and pull him the second he gives up a baserunner. In this case — with what is on the line and a doubleheader starting in a few hours — I’m fine just skipping that and going straight to Clase. Don’t even mess around and throw someone else out there who might collapse and give the Twins a window. Use your closer and have the rest of the bullpen ready to go for the nightcap. You’ll probably need them. </p>\n<p>It was the extremely safe decision to win this one game, but with a growing lead over the rest of the division, they can afford to be safe and keep winning one game at a time. </p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "Photo by Cole Burston/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Pinch-running is a quietly important part of the postseason; who among the bench players offers the most upside?</p> <p>Baseball is somewhat of an outlier among American sports in that the game-by-game strategy for personnel usage changes drastically when the postseason begins. Most notably, pitcher usage shifts dramatically, with the best and hardest-throwing pitchers working nearly every single important inning in October. The game slows down, and offense is typically at a premium.</p>\n<p>Part of the impact of the shifts in October is a renewed emphasis on pinch-running. Teams rarely utlize pinch-runners outside of obvious spots during the regular season, typically opting to keep their best bats in as long as possible. But with so many high-leverage spots in October which feature a team trying desperately to tally just a single run, pinch-running often takes the spotlight. As a consequence, an effective pinch-runner can be the difference between winning and losing a tight playoff game. So, who would be the best option to pinch-run on the Yankees’ roster?</p>\n<p>The Bombers have a number of options off of the bench that could potentially provide some solid running ability. Of course, this analysis will highly depend upon how they eventually decide to construct their playoff roster. The most likely candidates for pinch-running are, in some order, Marwin Gonzalez, Aaron Hicks, and Tim Locastro (I am assuming that Harrison Bader makes it onto the postseason roster primarily as the center fielder, not as a bench piece). Let’s take a look at these players bonafides as the club’s primary high-leverage pinch-runner.</p>\nMarwin Gonzalez\n  \n        \n      Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n  \n<p>Gonzalez has played a lot of good baseball in his career, but unfortunately he has never been known for his speed. Unsurprisingly, he hasn’t gotten any faster as he’s aged. Baseball Savant has his sprint speed pegged at 26.3 feet per second, which gives a fairly pedestrian 4.55 seconds from home plate to first. For some context, this kind of speed is in the bottom 30 percent of the league. With these kinds of numbers, he stands as more of defensive replacement than a pinch-runner on the Yankee playoff roster. </p>\nAaron Hicks\n  \n        \n      Photo by Duane Burleson/Getty Images\n  \n<p>A lot has been made of Hicks and his struggles this year, but one thing he has been able to rely upon has been his speed. He’s by no means an elite speedster, but he’s at the very least solid. His sprint speed comes in at a respectable 27.8 feet per second, with 4.29 seconds time from home to first. This puts Hicks in the top half of the league in speed at the 61st percentile.</p>\n<p>That said, Hicks has only attempted 17 steals across the last three seasons, coming out successfully 13 times. He profiles as a fine secondary pinch-runner if the need calls for it, but the Yankees likely would be best served by tabbing as their top pinch-runner:</p>\nTim Locastro\n  \n        \n      Photo by Elsa/Getty Images\n  \n<p>Let’s be honest here, Tim Locastro was always going to be the best pinch-runner in the postseason for the team. His speed stands out as his most important trait as a player, and it’s the reason why he has managed to continue playing in the major leagues without much ability to hit (.155/.214/.308 triple slash line in 2022). His  sprint speed of 30.2 feet per second is truly top of the line, fifth fastest in all of baseball this season.</p>\n<p>Locastro hasn’t been perfect on the bases this year, getting caught twice on nine attempts. This should engender some caution not to rely too heavily on his ability to steal a base. That said, he did start his career with a record stretch of stolen bases without getting caught, and his 38-for-43 overall. Ultimately, he is the best option on the roster to send out as a pinch runner. He has the speed, and the ability to steal bases with some consistency. </p>\n<p>The Yankees should strongly consider including him on their playoff roster for the tactical opportunities pinch-running Locastro could create late in games. He can’t hit much, but when the chips are down in a tight October matchup, the ability to swap a bag could swing a game. Locastro is the best man for that particular job.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

Let’s just drop right in, shall we?</p>\nmost read\n\nCutbacks at Area 120: Area 120 is Google’s in-house incubator, meant to let Googlers with potentially big ideas tap the mega company’s resources to turn said ideas into something real. This week, however, Google confirmed that it’s slashing half of the Area 120 projects currently in development, with the incubator “shifting its focus” to AI projects. Impacted employees are being given until early 2023 to find a new job within Google.\nAdobe buys Figma: In one of the biggest tech acquisitions of all time, Adobe announced this week its intent to buy the collaborative/web-based design tool Figma for a whopping $20 billion. Figma saw ridiculous growth throughout the pandemic, as many, many tech teams went remote and adjusted their workflows accordingly. Even for a company as big as Adobe, winning that part of the workflow back would’ve been tough.\nLayoffs at Twilio: Twilio confirmed this week that it’ll lay off roughly 11% of its workforce — somewhere between 800 and 900 people — as the company focuses on reaching profitability in 2023.\niOS 16 goes live: As expected, iOS 16 rolled out to Apple devices this week. Want our thoughts on it? Find Romain’s review here. Want to know all of the not-so-obvious new features hiding within the update? Check out Ivan’s list. Most of our readers seem to be looking for interesting ways to use those new Lock Screen widgets.\nSouth Korea issues an arrest warrant for Terraform Labs’ founder: “A court in South Korea has issued an arrest warrant for Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs,” writes Manish, “escalating its probe into the crypto ecosystem whose two tokens lost $40 billion in value in a span of days earlier this year.”\nUber hack: Late Thursday night, Uber confirmed that it’s “responding to a cybersecurity incident” after a hacker seemingly breached the company’s internal network, with the hacker reportedly announcing their presence (and protesting how Uber pays its drivers) right within Uber’s Slack.\n\naudio roundup\n<p>If you like TechCrunch for your eyes, check out TechCrunch for your ears. This week in TechCrunch podcast land, the Equity team talked about how Y Combinator has evolved in recent years, the Chain Reaction crew “dug into the institutional embrace of blockchains by stodgy financial powerhouses,” and the Found team went all “greatest hits” by revisiting an interview with Figma founder Dylan Field from earlier this year.</p>\ntechcrunch+\n<p>Want to know what TC+ members are reading most behind the paywall?

        "description": "<p>The transportation of undocumented immigrants from multiple southern border states to sanctuary cities and the Justice Department’s (DOJ) appeal to access some of the materials it obtained from Mar-a-Lago last month will likely dominate this week’s Sunday talk show circuit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republican Govs. Ron DeSantis (Fla.), Greg Abbott (Texas) and Doug Ducey (Ariz.) have sent migrants to northern cities run by Democrats with more lax undocumented immigration policies in opposition to President Biden ending Title 42, a Trump-era policy that prevented migrants from seeking asylum amid the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abbott sent a bus of migrants from the southern border to Chicago at the end of last month and sent two buses of migrants to the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., the residence of Vice President Harris, earlier this week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ducey has sent 1,800 migrants to D.C. since May, the Associated Press reported. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis confirmed on Wednesday that he had two planes containing about 50 migrants in total fly them to Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. The flights originated in San Antonio but made several stops on the way, Massachusetts state Sen. Julian Cyr (D) told The Hill. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>New York City has been one of the main locations that the governors have sent the migrants. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mayor Eric Adams (D) said in remarks at the city’s Asylum Seeker Resource Navigation Center on Thursday that the city has received more than 11,000 asylum-seekers in the past few months, an “unprecedented” amount. He said more than 8,000 are being housed in the city’s shelter system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We will continue to welcome asylum seekers with open arms and provide them the services they need,” he said. “And we are seeking to get additional resources.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adams, who will appear on ABC’s “This Week” and CNN’s “State of the Union,” said he communicated with the White House on Tuesday to request the resources that the city needs and is working with federal, state and local lawmakers. He has previously called for federal assistance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This country was built on immigrants and by immigrants. And we're going to honor the tradition, born here in New York City,” he said. “We are going to have open doors to them, not close the doors in their faces like we're seeing in other parts of this country.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adams has accused Abbott of using the migrants as “political pawns to manufacture a crisis.” An Abbott spokesperson told The Hill that Adams should call on Biden to “take immediate action to secure the border.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) represents a congressional district along the southern border with Mexico that includes outskirts of San Antonio. Cuellar, who will appear on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” is one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress and joined Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) last year in calling on the Biden administration to appoint a border czar to oversee the number of migrants coming across the border. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Face the Nation tweeted that Cuellar will discuss the migrant buses the GOP governors have sent and if it is a political move to “spotlight” a policy challenge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.) has joined a chorus of Democrats in slamming the moves by the three governors. Durbin led unsuccessful immigration reform negotiations with Republicans earlier this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Durbin said Abbott’s action sending the migrants to Chicago without any coordination with local authorities was “cruel and inhumane.” He said the flood of migrants has strained Chicago’s social welfare services, and officials have set up cots at the Salvation Army rescue center for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Durbin will appear on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest development in the Mar-a-Lago saga will also likely be a subject of discussion. The DOJ filed an appeal on Friday to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, requesting that the court overturn a judge’s ruling that prevents federal investigators from reviewing the more than 100 classified documents it obtained from former President Trump’s Palm Beach, Fla., property while a special master reviews the other materials. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judge Aileen Cannon ruled in favor of Trump’s request earlier this month for a special master to review if any of the materials are protected by attorney-client or executive privilege. The DOJ responded by asking Cannon to overturn the ruling regarding the classified documents it obtained and said it would appeal to a higher court if she did not do so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannon denied the DOJ’s request and appointed a special master that both Trump and the DOJ agreed to on Thursday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>John Ratcliffe, the former director of national intelligence for Trump, has raised questions about the DOJ probe, telling CBS in an interview last month that nothing he saw in the partially redacted affidavit that the FBI used to obtain a search warrant of Mar-a-Lago justified what seemed like an “extreme” approach by federal investigators. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ratcliffe will appear on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DOJ has said that classified documents were likely concealed from Mar-a-Lago in an attempt to obstruct the investigation. Multiple news outlets reported Friday that a Trump attorney told the National Archives last year that the boxes Trump took from the White House only contained news clippings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graham, who will appear on “Fox News Sunday,” warned last month that there would be “riots in the streets” if Trump is indicted over his alleged mishandling of classified and sensitive documents. He later defended the comment after he received pushback, saying that he was trying to “state the obvious.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is the full list of guests scheduled to appear on this week’s Sunday talk shows: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>ABC’s “This Week” — New York City Mayor Eric Adams; Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova </p>\n\n\n\n<p>NBC’s “Meet the Press” — Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.); Joe O’Dea, Republican Senate nominee in Colorado </p>\n\n\n\n<p>CBS’ “Face the Nation” — Rep.

        "description": "<p>President Biden on Friday signed a bill that will eliminate the statute of limitations for people who were sexually abused as minors to file civil claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eliminating Limits to Justice for Child Sex Abuse Victims Act was passed by the House by voice vote on Tuesday after passing the Senate by unanimous consent in March.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill eliminates time constraints for survivors to file civil claims related to sex abuse crimes against minors, including forced labor, sex trafficking, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, minors who survived such abuse were able to file federal claims until they reached the age of 28 or until a decade after the violation or injury was discovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No federal statute of limitations was in place for criminal claims regarding child sex abuse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill was initially introduced by Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and co-sponsored by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The science of trauma is clear: it often takes years for victims to come forward,” Durbin said in a statement after the House passed the bill. “Our bipartisan bill honors the basic notions of justice for survivors, and I was proud to work with Senator Blackburn and our colleagues in the House to lead it across the finish line. By signing this legislation into law, we can finally help survivors have their day in court and a moment of healing—when they are ready.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>The White Sox have placed Michael Kopech on the 15-day injured list, as the right-hander is dealing with right shoulder inflammation.  Righty Davis Martin has been called up from Triple-A to take Kopech’s spot on the active roster.</p>\n<p>Though Kopech hasn’t pitched since September 13, there wasn’t any retroactive date attached to Kopech’s IL placement, and thus his 15-day clock starts today.  That means Kopech will be out of action until at least October 2, and it is quite possible his season could be over if his shoulder issue isn’t healed.  White Sox GM Rick Hahn told reporters (including MLB.com’s Scott Merkin) that tests didn’t reveal any structural damage, but while Kopech’s injury isn’t a long-term problem, his absence will hamper a Chicago team fighting to get into the 2022 postseason.</p>\n<p>In his first full season as a starting pitcher, Kopech has a 3.54 ERA over 119 1/3 innings, but also a much less-flattering 4.73 SIERA.  A tiny .229 BABIP has helped Kopech overcome below-average strikeout and hard-hit ball rates, as well as an 11.5% walk rate that is only in the tenth percentile of all pitchers.</p>\n<p>This is Kopech’s second IL stint of the season, as he previously missed the minimum 15 days while recovering from a knee sprain in late August and early September.  Since Kopech missed all of 2019-20 and then only threw 69 1/3 innings in 2021, there was some question about how much Kopech would pitch this season, and he has only hit the seven-inning threshold in two games.  However, assuming that this shoulder injury is indeed just inflammation, Kopech has been relatively healthy in the wake of his increase in workload, and should be on pace for more of a normal starter’s routine in 2023.</p>\n<p>Martin is the logical candidate to fill in for Kopech, and Martin will actually take the hill today against the Tigers — regular starter Johnny Cueto has been scratched due to a non-COVID illness.  Martin has a respectable 4.09 ERA over 44 innings in his first MLB season, though counting on a rookie down the stretch isn’t an ideal situation for Chicago.  After the Guardians’ win today, Cleveland holds a 4.5-game lead over Chicago in the AL Central, and the White Sox are also 6.5 games back in the wild card race.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Thursday I visited the first day of the two day Netherlands WordCamp that, after a 6 year hiatus, took place again. Some observations:</p>\n\nThe venue was fun, in the middle of Burgers Zoo in Arnhem. From the room where I presented you looked out over the enclosure where the giraffes and rhino’s were. The entrance to the venue was through the tropical jungle greenhouse, with unseen birds and other animals making lots of noises somewhere above in the foliage.\nThe atmosphere was excellent, very laid back as well as open and curious to engage in conversation\nIt was my first time at WordCamp and somewhere above a third of the participants were as well, meaning there was a good mix of new people and old hands. A mix that helps set the atmosphere and tone of an event.\nSustainability was a big theme. Multiple speakers explored how WP web developers can reduce the footprint of the sites they create. Heard several things (reduce the number of URLs WP exposes, find ways of limiting hits generated by crawlers and bots, reduce the size of various elements in your WP site etc.) that I can follow up on. Also made me think again about running a RSS-only, otherwise completely headless website. Though given another takeaway further down the list, that isn’t a good idea.\nThe organising team had also focused on sustainability, and I was happy they went the same route as is the custom at IndieWeb events: all catering was vegetarian. I also learned that all food that wasn’t used was donated, pre-arranged with the local foodbank.\nIt was fun to meet several people in person that I’ve known online for a long time, such as Roel Groeneveld and Gerard van Enk, and co-organisers Marcel and Remkus. Others I had met before, like Bert Boerland. Plus I met some new people.\nI think my presentation was well received.\nI was a bit the odd one out, as I am a non-professional blogger who is a WordPress user, not a developer. It was a WordCamp, by the WP community and ecosystem, so the audience was largely commercially oriented. Web agencies, SEO, UX design etc. I am also someone who has a longer history with WordPress than some others, having seen it start as a blogging tool.\nThe WordPress community is large and densely connected, I’m an outsider to it, although I know quite a few people who are part of it. So this wasn’t ‘my’ crowd, but the energy from people meeting in person again after several years was palpable.\nWhen the opening speaker asked ‘who here still reads RSS’ and only 5 or so raised their hands, in line with his expectations, was surprising to say the least. People either ditched RSS when Google Reader went away in 2013, or if they were younger never started with RSS. How do people read at volume if not through feeds? Actually going to websites and newsletters is the answer apparently.\nOnly a few people had ever heard of IndieWeb, although there definitely were some.\nOne of the volunteers I chatted with never heard of BarCamp. Nor realised that the Camp in WordCamp speaks of its lineage. This is akin to how in 2021 the supposedly first Dutch BarCamp was going to take place.\nThose last three things underline what E and I have been chatting about in the past months regularly. How it is needed to keep talking about, writing about and transfer to others these things, repeatedly that we think are ‘just normal’ and essential. For things to be used, and be useful, you can never assume that telling the world about it is ever done. Which brings me back to why I was at WordCamp in the first place, talking about IndieWeb.\n\n<p><br />My first encounter with WordPress, at BlogTalk 2006 in Vienna.

        "link": "https://reason.com/volokh/2022/09/17/why-the-florida-and-texas-social-media-laws-violate-the-takings-clause/",
        "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Yesterday, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld Texas' law banning major social media websites from using most forms of content moderation. The decision is at odds with a recent Eleventh Circuit ruling striking down Florida's similar law (written by prominent conservative Trump appointee Judge Kevin Newsom). In May, the Supreme Court signaled that at least five justices believe the law to be unconstitutional, when it overturned a previous Fifth Circuit ruling lifting a trial court injunction against implementation of the Texas law.  For reasons I summarized here, I agree with the Eleventh Circuit's approach, and believe the Texas and Florida laws violate the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech. In this post, I argue that these laws also violate the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The Takings Clause bars government from taking \"private property\" without paying \"just compensation.\" In its 2021 ruling in Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid, the Supreme Court ruled (correctly, in my view) that even a temporary government-mandated \"physical occupation\" or invasion of private property counts as a per se taking, automatically requiring compensation.  Thus, the Court struck down a California law requiring agricultural growers to grant access to their property to union organizers. The Court emphasized that \"[t]he right to exclude is universally held to be a fundamental element of the property right,\" and that violations of that right presumptively qualify as takings.</p>\n<p>The Florida and Texas social media laws are also blatant attacks on the right to exclude. No one doubts that the Twitter site and its various features are Twitter's private property. And the whole point of the Florida and Texas law is force Twitter and other social media firms to grant access to users and content the firms would prefer to exclude, particularly various right-wing users. Just as the plaintiffs in Cedar Point wanted to bar union organizers from their land, so Twitter wishes to bar some content it finds abhorrent (or that might offend or annoy other users).</p>\n<p>To be sure, there are obvious differences between virtual property, such as a website, and more conventional physical property, like that involved in the Cedar Point case. But the Taking Clause nonetheless applies to both. If Texas decided to seize the Twitter site, bar current users, and instead fill it with content praising the state government's policies, that would pretty obviously be a taking, much like if California decided to seize the Cedar Point tree nursery's land.  In the same way, requiring Twitter to host unwanted content qualifies as an occupation of its property, no less than requiring a landowner to give access to unwanted entrants. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that intellectual property is protected by the Takings Clause. Websites present similar issues.</p>\n<p>One could argue that forcing a website owner to host unwanted users isn't really a \"physical occupation,\" because the property is virtual in nature. But websites, including the big social media firms, use physical server space. Other things equal, a site with more user-generated content requires more such space than one with less. Even aside from the connection to physical infrastructure, it seems to me that occupation of virtual \"real estate\" is analogous to occupation of land. Both are valuables forms of private property from which the owner generally has a right to exclude.</p>\n<p>In Cedar Point, the Supreme Court did note some exceptions to the rule that government-mandated occupations of property qualify as takings. The one most relevant to the social media case is that for locations \"generally open to the public,\" such as shopping malls. In his majority opinion in Cedar Point, Chief Justice John Roberts used this theory to distinguish the Supreme Court's 1980 decision in Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins, which held that a shopping mall could not bar people who wanted to leaflet on its property.</p>\n<p>For reasons outlined in a two articles by Prof. Gregory Sisk (see here and here), I think Pruneyard was a bad decision and should be overruled. But, in the meantime, it is readily distinguishable from the Texas and Florida social media laws. Despite appearances, sites like Twitter and Facebook are not \"generally open to the public\" in the sense that anyone who wants to can post content on the site. Rather, they are only open to those who agree to the sites' terms of services. As Twitter's terms of service, for example, make clear, \"[y]ou may use the Services only if you agree to form a binding contract with Twitter and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction.\"  The contract in question includes acceptance of Twitter's content moderation rules. Few if any shopping malls have similar access restrictions!</p>\n<p>Cedar Point outlines a few other exceptions to the rule that physical occupations are per se takings. Examples include regulatory health and safety inspections. By similar logic, websites that, for example, sell potentially dangerous goods and services, might be required to post warnings about the possible risks. In addition, the \"police power\" sometimes creates a general exception to takings liability, as when police must enter a property to execute a search warrant. But none of these other exceptions even come close to justifying the Florida and Texas social media laws.</p>\n<p>If government imposition of unwanted content on websites does not qualify as a taking, it would have dire implications for a wide range of websites, not just social media providers. The government could similarly force a wide range of other sites to accept unwanted content. Unscrupulous politicians and interest groups could take the opportunity to force all kinds of websites to promote their preferred content, or at least bar them from excluding content that the site owners disapprove of. Such a regime would be a serious menace to online property rights, though the consequences would be far less dire if the social media firms prevail in the current free speech litigation.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Eleventh Circuit decision holding that the Florida social media law violates the First Amendment, a ruling that such a law violates the Takings Clause wouldn't necessarily bar states from enacting and enforcing such legislation. The could still do so, so long as they paid \"just compensation,\" which usually means the \"fair market value\" of the property taken.</p>\n<p>Calculating the amount of compensation due in a case like this might be complicated. In the case of many would-be users (those with few potential followers), the market value of a Twitter or Facebook account could be very low. But the aggregate compensation for forcing social media firms to accept large numbers of unwanted users could still be very large, perhaps large enough to deter states from passing such legislation in the first place.</p>\n<p>The present litigation against the Florida and Texas laws does not involve Takings Clause claims. But such claims could potentially be filed in the future, especially in the Texas case, where the law seems likely to go into effect, unless and until the Supreme Court reverses the Fifth Circuit ruling on the First Amendment issue. If social media firms choose to pursue this issue, they could well prevail - and certainly deserve to do so.</p>\n<p>The post Why the Florida and Texas Social Media Laws Violate the Takings Clause appeared first on Reason.com.</p>",

        "description": "<p> The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has been reconnected to the national electricity grid after engineers repaired one of the four main external power lines damaged during the Russian invasion of the country, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Saturday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nuclear facility’s “power status has improved over the past week,” but the general situation at the plant “remains precarious,” IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement. “While there has been no recent shelling at or near the ZNPP, it continues to occur in the wider area,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zaporizhzhia facility, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has not been providing electricity since September 5, the agency said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.N. nuclear watchdog has had monitors at the site since late August, following a visit by a team of IAEA experts. Russia seized the facility in March, but it has continued to be operated by Ukrainian staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IAEA on Monday set out plans for a security protection zone around plant. The agency would ensure that the security perimeter is respected, Grossi said. The proposal is being discussed with Ukraine and Russia, Grossi said, adding that he has “seen signs that they are interested in this agreement.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis earlier this week said the international community must secure the Zaporizhzhia plant by completely expelling Russian forces from the area. </p>",

        "description": "<p>President Biden is telling everyone he plans to run for a second term, but with about 50 days to the midterms, most Democrats aren’t sure he will follow through on that plan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cedric Richmond, the former Democratic lawmaker and Biden White House official, said definitively this week that it’s on when it comes to Biden and 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He’s running and we’re building an infrastructure for him to run and win,” Richmond told NBC. “Right now, it’s all an early investment in 2024 while we’re helping 2022.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite such statements, a lot of Democrats have their doubts even as their overall optimism for the fall midterms rises as Biden’s approval ratings inch up and polls and voter registration numbers offer evidence of voter anger with the Supreme Court’s abortion decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Democrats lose the House, as most still expect, but keep the Senate majority, will Biden decide to stick with his stated plans and be the party’s nominee?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If things go more poorly and Democrats lose the House and the now evenly divided Senate, will it be the kind of political blow that changes Biden’s mind about running for president?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite his insistence, will age ultimately end up being a factor? Biden will turn 81 in November 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if former President Trump runs again and looks like an odds-on favorite to win the GOP nomination, will Biden put everything aside to run again?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind the scenes, Democrats are talking, and talking about the possibilities, debating the pros and cons of a Biden run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think a lot of the mystery is we're all beholden to the never-ending political news cycle, and Trump announced for reelection like three minutes after taking office, but it's not unusual for a president to be waiting until after the midterms to announce,” said Democratic strategist Eddie Vale, urging Democrats to stay calm.<br /><br />“I think a lot of people who were speculating about him not running were bed wetting because of insanely far out poll numbers and/or have a different preferred candidate, but every indication seems to me he's running,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden has repeatedly said he intends to launch another presidential bid for 2024. As recently as June, he said he “would not be disappointed” to face Trump in a rematch. Last week, Vice President Harris — largely considered the front-runner if Biden should step aside — also reiterated that view. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The president has been very clear that he intends to run again,” she told Chuck Todd on NBC’s \"Meet the Press.\" “And if he does, I will be running with him proudly.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sources say Biden has also begun to quietly examine what a 2024 campaign might look like, while testing out messages during the midterms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beltway pundits have parsed every cue and nuance — however slight— to solidify their views. When first lady Jill Biden said this week on NBC’s \"Today\" that she and her husband had “not yet” discussed another run, some took that as a sign that it isn’t happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Age is a major reason for doubts about Biden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I love the guy. I think he’s done a good job as president, but I also can’t see the likelihood of a guy in his 80s running again,” one strategist said. “Like it or not, he’s old.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is rare for a sitting president to not run for reelection. The last time that happened was with Lyndon Johnson at the height of the Vietnam war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the nation has never had a president as old as Biden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The president is also the only Democrat to actually defeat Trump in the Electoral College race. That will be a factor; few Democrats see another candidate in their ranks who is widely seen as having a stronger change against Trump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, noted that Biden faces questions beyond his age — including his handling of the economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Biden took a victory lap this week for the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, he had to contend with a split screen on cable news showing a falling stock market reacting to the news that consumer prices rose in August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden has said he feels he is the only one in the Democratic Party who can defeat Trump, who turned 76 in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if Trump doesn’t run, Biden could face an opponent like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who Democrats fear could put up a good fight. Age would be a contrast and possibly a factor in a Biden match-up with DeSantis, who is 44.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Every presidential election is high stakes but after four years of the Trump presidency this feels more real than ever before. Combine all of these [factors] and the questions don't go away,” Zelizer said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those questions continued to loom around the Biden presidency earlier this year as his poll numbers fell sharply and survey after survey showed that voters largely said the country was heading in the wrong direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More recently, after scoring a few legislative wins, Biden has rebounded. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A New York Times-Siena College survey, published Friday, showed Biden with a 42 percent approval rating, up from 33 percent in the last poll in July. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The president’s numbers were boosted largely by Democrats who are more optimistic about his leadership, as he faced major crises in recent months including the Russian war in Ukraine, soaring gas prices and record-high inflation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There was always a path for the president to get back to a politically strong position and it’s because a lot of the loss of support was from some Democrats,” said Democratic strategist Joel Payne. “He has clearly been able to rebuild that over the summer and that bodes well for him going into a 2024 reelection campaign.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, others are more skeptical that Biden will be able to pull off another victory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He’s had an amazing run, probably one of the best stories in the modern political era,” said one Democratic donor. “But you have to know when it’s time to hang up your hat, even for your own legacy.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other Democrats scoff at the naysayers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I find it interesting that all of these so called 'experts' won’t go on the record,” said Democratic strategist Rodell Mollineau. “It’s likely because when he does run and wins, they’re going to look foolish.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mollineau added: “I suspect these are the same people who didn't think he was going to win the first time.”</p>",

        "description": "Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>With one roster spot left, the Lakers are finally targeting a wing in free agency. </p> <p>After signing Dennis Schröder to a veteran’s minimum contract, the Lakers have one roster spot left for the 2022-23 season, barring any other significant moves over the next week.  </p>\n<p>On the first episode of the Cole Swider show, Swider — who is presently on a two-way contract with the Lakers — said that he has seen significant interest from free agents trying to join the Lakers before training camp because several of them have shown up at the team practice facility: </p>\n<p>“Training camp’s coming up, we have two open roster spots, and everyone in the league wants to play for the Lakers. So we’re having all these guys come in for free agent workouts and everything like that. So when they see two open roster spots on the Lakers, a lot of people are interested, playing with Lebron, playing on that stage.” </p>\n<p>(Note: This episode came out before the Schröder signing, which is why Swider says the Lakers have two roster spots left.)</p>\n<p>The good news for Lakers fans is that the front office actually appears to have the right archetype in mind for player no. 15. Per reporting from Michael Scotto of HoopsHype, the Lakers have brought in at least four wings for workouts: Jeremy Lamb, Dwayne Bacon, Miye Oni, and Shabazz Muhammad. </p>\n\n\n<p>Sources: The Los Angeles Lakers brought in several free agents for workouts, including former lottery picks Shabazz Muhammad and Jeremy Lamb. Dwayne Bacon, Miye Oni and others also worked out for the Lakers, @hoopshype has learned.</p>— Michael Scotto (@MikeAScotto) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Lamb is by far the most intriguing name of the four. At 6’5, he looks like a 2-guard, though his 6’11 wingspan allows him to play up a position defensively. He’s an excellent rebounder for a wing and blocks shots at an extremely high rate. Offensively, his best skill is his floater but he doesn’t get to the rim particularly often, and he’s only been a league-average three-point shooter about once every four years. Lamb has stuck in the league for ten seasons, suggesting that he’s doing something right, but his lack of spacing could be a problem on this Lakers roster. </p>\n<p>If Lamb’s shooting is suspect, then wait till you get to Bacon, who is probably best known for Rick Cho accidentally calling him Dwyane Wade in his introductory press conference in Charlotte. At 6’7, Bacon has some good size, and he’s still just 27 years old. Unfortunately, his effective field-goal percentage has ranked in the bottom 10 percent of wings in three of his four seasons, per Cleaning the Glass. Other than not turning the ball over, it’s hard to find much of anything that Bacon excels at. </p>\n<p>Oni doesn’t have the problem of a poor track record, but that’s because he’s only played 672 minutes over three seasons in Utah. He took all of nine shots in the 2021-22 season, making one of them. He hasn’t even suited up in the G League since 2019-20, so Oni would be a pure flier considering what a blank slate he’s been in his NBA career. </p>\n<p>At least Oni has been tangentially a part of the league over the last three years, because Muhammad hasn’t played for an NBA team since 2018. His best trait was as a volume scorer and he never really did that efficiently, which makes him an odd fit on a Laker team where he wouldn’t have the ball in his hands. But he’s 6’6, which was apparently the only barrier of entry for this particular workout. </p>\n<p>Although it’s nice to see the Lakers recognizing a position of weakness and trying to address it, at this point in free agency, there are slim pickings. The Lakers can’t even really create a training camp battle because they already have 19 players on their camp roster unless they choose to waive Wenyen Gabriel, who is on a non-guaranteed deal, or one of the two-ways. </p>\n<p>The best opportunity to find a quality wing to play next to LeBron James and Anthony Davis would have come in July, and the Lakers struck out then. Now, they’re hunting in the bargain bin. The only way out of this mess would be acquiring a wing via trade, which would solve more than one of the team’s current problems.</p>\n<p>For more Lakers talk, subscribe to the Silver Screen and Roll podcast feed on iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher or Google Podcasts.

Aaron Nola takes the mound for the Phillies and he has been a legit Cy Young candidate this season. Meanwhile the Braves’ fifth starter Jake Odorizzi gets the start for Atlanta. You can read more about this pitching matchup here in our game preview.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, after a fairly long lull, the Braves offense really needed that big eighth inning on Friday. William Contreras has continued to be a spark this year, and he is once again in the lineup tonight, as the designated hitter. Matt Olson has not been very good for the last few weeks, so him heating up would be big, as he continues to bat cleanup. Eddie Rosario gets the call as the left-fielder, as Ronald Acuna continues to play right field after an extended “break” of playing DH. Ozzie Albies starts at second again, as Vaughn Grissom is once again on the bench. See the Statcast breakdown of the lineups below.</p>",

        "description": "<p>DFL Gov. Tim Walz has agreed to two debates next month leading up to the Nov. 8 general election. The first is being hosted by KTTC-TV in Rochester, and airing on its fellow Gray Television-owned stations that serve Minnesota: KBJR in Duluth, KEYC in Mankato and KXJB in Fargo/Moorhead. </p><p>The second debate will air on MPR News on Oct. 28. </p><p>Both will be streamed on the internet. </p><p>“The additional debates will bring the total number of debates for the campaign to three, including FarmFest,” the Walz campaign said in a statement. “This is the same number of debates that were held in the U.S. Senate elections won by Amy Klobuchar in 2018 and Tina Smith in both 2018 and 2020.”</p><p>But Scott Jensen, Walz’s Republican challenger, called the agreement “too little, too late.” He said the two debates will happen after the start of early voting in Minnesota, which begins on Sept. 23.</p><p>“None of the debates Tim Walz has agreed to will be in front of Minnesota voters and none will even air on metro television,” Jensen said in a statement. “Let me repeat: Tim Walz has not agreed to a single debate that will air on Twin Cities television.”</p><p>If the number remains at three, it would be the fewest number of scheduled debates in a gubernatorial race in several cycles.</p><p>Correction (Sept. 18, 2022): An earlier version of this story provided the wrong date for the start of early voting.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Vice President Kamala Harris accused Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) of “dereliction of duty” over their recent transports of migrants to Democratic-led cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think it is the height of irresponsibility … frankly, a dereliction of duty, when you are an elected leader, to play those kinds of games with human life and human beings,” Harris said in an interview with Vice News. “If you think there is a problem, be part of the solution.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Abbott has bused thousands of migrants to Washington, D.C., New York City and Chicago since April, he and DeSantis have recently made more dramatic moves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two buses of migrants from Texas arrived at Harris’ home in Washington, D.C. on Thursday. Abbott said he sent the buses to Harris’ doorstep in response to a statement she made last Sunday on “Meet the Press,\" calling the border \"secure.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis sent two planes of migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard on Wednesday, in his first foray into transporting migrants to Democratic-led cities. The Florida governor promised on Friday that this is “just the beginning” of his efforts to relocate migrants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Abbott and DeSantis have blamed Biden’s immigration policies for current issues at the border, Harris instead placed the blame on the Trump administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Under the previous administration, they decimated a system that was designed to address immigration,” Harris told Vice News. “And so we have been spending, in the last 18 months, an incredible amount of time and work and resources to reconstruct that system.” </p>",

        "description": "<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an address to the Ukrainian people on Friday that the country’s officials pitched to world leaders the idea of creating an ad hoc international tribunal to punish Russia for war crimes it has committed during its invasion of Ukraine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zelensky said the proposal was made during a meeting of a group working to advance Ukraine joining the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental association of democracies with market-based economies that work to stimulate economic growth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is an extremely important direction, which is important both in the context of European integration and in the context of the internal transformation of our state,” Zelensky said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said ambassadors from the G-7, a forum of the world’s seven largest economies, and other partner states were present at the meeting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine have been recorded since Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country began in February. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian officials found a mass burial site in the recaptured city of Izyum this week, and Zelensky said in his Friday address that “torture chambers” where civilians were abused were found in areas of the Kharkiv region that were liberated from Russian occupation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United Nations said on Friday that investigators already in Ukraine will examine the mass burial site in Izyum. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mass burial sites were also found in the city of Bucha, north of the capital Kyiv, after Russian forces withdrew earlier this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine has been seeking to integrate itself further with the rest of Europe since the war started. The country applied to join the OECD in May and became an official candidate to join the European Union in June.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In between games of their doubleheader with the Reds today, the Cardinals activated left-hander Steven Matz from the 15-day injured list.  Taking Matz’s spot on the 15-day IL is Jordan Hicks, as the right-hander has been sidelined by both arm fatigue and neck spasms.  Hicks’ placement is retroactive to September 15.</p>\n<p>After signing a four-year, $44MM free agent deal during the winter, Matz’s first season in St. Louis has largely been lost to injury — first a shoulder impingement, and then a torn left MCL suffered in his first game back aftr that prior IL stint.  Given the initial concern following the MCL tear, it is somewhat remarkable that Matz is back at all in 2022, but he will be able to work out of the bullpen rather than as a fully built-up starting pitcher.</p>\n<p>Beyond just the health woes, Matz’s misfortune extended to his work on the mound.  Despite a very good 4.8% walk rate and 27.4% strikeout rate over his 42 2/3 innings of work this season, Matz has only a 5.70 ERA.  His 3.13 SIERA is far more favorable, yet Matz hasn’t received much batted-ball luck, as evidenced by his .336 BABIP.</p>\n<p>Those struggles will be just a memory, however, if Matz is able to contribute as a reliever for a Cardinals team that looks bound for the playoffs, thanks to an eight-game lead in the NL Central.  Getting Matz in the bullpen may help make up for the loss of Hicks, who also missed about five weeks earlier this season due to a flexor strain.</p>\n<p>Injuries have plagued Hicks in the past, including a Tommy John surgery in 2019 and a lengthy absence due to elbow soreness last season.  His flexor strain this year ended the Cardinals’ experiment with Hicks as a starting pitcher, and while his advanced metrics are better since his move back to the bullpen, he has only a 4.50 ERA over 34 innings as a reliever, after posting a 5.47 ERA over 26 1/3 innings out of the rotation.  It all adds up to a 4.92 total ERA, and one of the league’s worst (13.6%) walk rates.  Between this performance and now the injury concern, it remains to be seen if the Cards will include Hicks on their postseason roster.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Frankie Montas is going to undergo an MRI after feeling some discomfort in his right shoulder during yesterday’s game.  Montas told the New York Post’s Jon Heyman and other reporters that he is “feeling optimistic about” the injury and “I don’t think it’s anything crazy,” yet naturally any type of shoulder issue is a potential problem, especially this late in the season.  Montas also missed time with shoulder soreness back in July when he was still a member of the Athletics, as he went 18 days (including the All-Star break) between starts while resting up.</p>\n<p>An injury would only continue what has been a difficult beginning to Montas’ tenure in the Bronx.  The Yankees acquired Montas in one of the most notable pre-deadline trades, yet the right-hander has posted a 6.35 ERA over eight starts and 39 2/3 innings in the pinstripes.  Even if the MRI reveals nothing severe, the Yankees could opt to skip Montas for a turn in the rotation, or perhaps even place him on the 15-day injured list in order to get him fully recovered and perhaps on track in general heading into the postseason.</p>\n<p>More from around the AL East…</p>\n\nIn better injury news for the Yankees, Anthony Rizzo is tentatively slated to return to the lineup on Sunday, The Athletic’s Chris Kirschner tweets.  Rizzo hasn’t played since August 31 due to a epidural he received to try and alleviate nagging back pain, and Rizzo also had to deal with migraine headaches as a side effect of that epidural.  With only a .200/.282/.371 slash line over his last 78 plate appearances before going on the 10-day injured list, it was clear Rizzo’s back was hampering his play, as the veteran has otherwise been one of New York’s top hitters all season.  A healthy and productive Rizzo would be a huge boost to the Yankees in their push for a World Series title.\nAlejandro Kirk has missed the Blue Jays’ last four games due to hip tightness, but interim manager John Schneider told reporters (including Sportsnet’s Shi Davidi) that Kirk did some running and other baseball activities today.  It is possible Kirk could return to action on Sunday, when Alek Manoah is the scheduled starter — Kirk has been behind the plate for every pitch Manoah has thrown this season.  This brief absence could also serve as something of a reset for Kirk, whose big first half earned him an All-Star nod, but the catcher has a modest .261/.352/.338 slash line over 182 PA since the All-Star break.\nInitial x-rays were negative on Ryan Mountcastle’s left elbow after the Orioles first baseman was hit by a Jose Berrios pitch in the second inning of today’s game.  Mountcastle was removed in the bottom half of the frame with what the team described as an elbow contusion.  While Mountcastle’s .243/.295/.429 numbers over 542 PA represents a dropoff (especially in slugging percentage) from his 2021 production, his 103 wRC+ is still above the league average, and he has hit 22 homers this season.\nThe Red Sox are facing a 40-man roster crunch this winter, and The Boston Globe’s Alex Speier takes a look at some of the names (some a lot more certain than others) to be added to the roster in advance of the Rule 5 Draft.  For some of these players on the borderline, the remaining two-plus weeks of the regular season will serve as a chance to catch the eye of Red Sox brass.",

        "link": "https://www.denverpost.com/2022/09/17/charlie-blackmon-rockies-beat-cubs/",
        "description": "<p>Charlie Blackmon busted his slump in a big way.</p>\n<p>The Rockies’ veteran designated hitter ripped an RBI triple into the right fielder corner in the ninth inning to score pinch runner Garrett Hampson and produce the go-ahead run in a 3-1 victory over the Cubs on Saturday afternoon at Chicago’s Wrigley Field.</p>\n<p>“Now was a good time to get a hit,” Blackmon told AT&amp;T SportsNet. “It was a good job by Buddy (manager Bud Black) of putting a speedy guy in right there.”</p>\n<p>The Rockies had produced only four baserunners through the first eight innings until C.J. Cron coaxed a one-out walk out of reliever Adbert Alzolay. Hampson came in for Cron and scored easily on Blackmon’s fifth triple of the season.</p>\n<p>Colorado scored a cushion run on Elias Diaz’s single up the middle to bring home Blackmon and make it 3-1.</p>\n<p>Blackmon entered the game hitting .122 (5-for-41) in 11 games in September and was hitting just .217 (35-for-161) since the All-Star break. Yet Blackmon has remained cool in the clutch. Since July 1, he’s hit .390 (23-for-59) with runners in scoring position, the sixth-highest average in the majors.</p>\n<p>“That is always the expectation with Charlie and I’ve seen it so often,” Black told reporters. “Team-wide, with the expectation of (Yonathan) Daza, it’s been a little bit of a struggle for a number of weeks. For most of our players, it’s been a struggle, so that was big from Charlie.”</p>\n<p>Struggle, indeed. Before beating the Cubs, Colorado had lost 13 of its last 17 road games, averaging 2.2 runs per game with a .198 team batting average.</p>\n<p>Black said that the players were thrilled for Blackmon.</p>\n<p>“One of the great things I like about this team is the camaraderie and the unselfishness of the guys pulling for each other,” Black said. “The group pulls harder for Charlie than anybody because of what he means to the guys and the great example that he sets every day, about how to be a pro and how to go about the job.”</p>\n<p>Closer Daniel Bard gave up a single to Yan Gomes in the ninth but was never in trouble and he recorded his 31st save in 34 opportunities.</p>\n<p>Right-hander Jose Urena, commanding all of his pitches, gave the Rockies six strong innings, yielding just one run on seven hits. He struck out four and walked two.</p>\n<p>“He got some big outs, with two outs, for sure,” Black said. “He got some groundballs and his stuff was good. I liked his fastball, and his changeup came into play today, which is really encouraging. I liked that a lot.”</p>\n<p>Urena’s performance certainly gives the Rockies food for thought as they contemplate whether or not to attempt to bring the right-hander back for next season. Urena, 30, is scheduled to become a free agent.</p>\n<p>“He’s trying to make an impression, like a lot of guys,” Black said. “We’ll have some decisions to make with our roster … But he’s doing everything he can to put himself out there in a good position.”</p>\n<p>The Cubs clawed out a 1-0 lead in the fifth off Urena. Ian Happ stroked a one-out single to right-center, advanced to third on Alfonso Rivas’ single, and scored on P.J. Higgins’ infield single to third baseman Ryan McMahon. Higgins just barely beat McMahon’s throw to Cron at first.

        "description": "Photo by Quinn Harris/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The recently-acquired righthander was outstanding in his first MLB start.</p> <p>I don’t know about you, but I think the Cubs have found a member of their 2023 starting rotation.</p>\n<p>Just how good Hayden Wesneski will be in his MLB career remains to be seen, of course, but he was dazzling in his first MLB start, throwing seven innings and allowing three hits and a run.</p>\n<p>This sums things up for me regarding Wesneski:</p>\n\n\n<p>Hayden Wesneski was brilliant today. All 3 hits and the run allowed were basebally nonsense.</p>— Matt Clapp (@TheBlogfines) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Think about it, Matt Clapp is right. Wesneski retired the first Rockies hitter, then Yonathan Daza lined a ball just fair down the right field line that bounced into the seats for an automatic double. Then Wesneski retired the next 16 Rockies in a row before Ryan McMahon hit a ball that Zach McKinstry nearly made a great play for an out, but it wound up an infield single.</p>\n<p>In the seventh, C.J. Cron hit another ball just fair down the RF line for yet another automatic double, and one out later this “basebally nonsense” happened [VIDEO].</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Two bad throws were made during that sequence, but no error was charged, because that was basically a fielder’s choice that allowed the tying run to score. Wesneski got out of the rest of that inning for a stellar first MLB start. He’s certainly earned the chance for more of those this year.</p>\n<p>I mentioned that was the tying run. Here’s the sequence on which the Cubs took the lead, in the fifth. Ian Happ singled with one out and one out later, Alfonso Rivas singled him to third. Rivas took second on the throw into the infield, so runners were on second and third for P.J. Higgins.</p>\n<p>Then this happened [VIDEO].</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>If that ball gets through, two runs score and Higgins is still on first. Unfortunately, it didn’t, and after Happ scored, Rivas tried to score and was thrown out.</p>\n<p>Could have been significant later in the game, but we’ll never know.</p>\n<p>What I do know about later in the game is this: I wish, fervently, that the Cubs would stop thinking about Adbert Alzolay as a multi-inning reliever. He made his season debut in this game and struck out the first three hitters he faced, retiring the side in order in the eighth. That took 19 pitches, several of which hit 97 on the Wrigley pitch speed meter. That’s good!</p>\n<p>So why send him out for the ninth? He clearly didn’t have it, walking the second batter he faced in the ninth and then allowing a long triple into the corner by Charlie Blackmon that made it 2-1 Rockies, and then a single by Elias Diaz made it 3-1. Sure, Alzolay then struck out two more Rockies to end the inning — but no more 97, his velocity was around 93-94 by the time the ninth ended. If he hadn’t struck out Eleuris Montero to end the inning, Jeremiah Estrada was going to enter the game.</p>\n<p>Alzolay threw 41 pitches. In my opinion, that’s way too many for him for one outing. He should be a one-inning guy — that way, perhaps a future closer. Perhaps you disagree, but that’s how I see it. He sees it that way too, incidentally:</p>\n\n\n<p>Alzolay struck out 5 in 2-inning return from injured list. Allowed 2 runs in 9th inning (walk, triple, single), but all things considered, good to see the pitcher back.<br /><br />He's open to relief in '23, if needed.<br /><br />\"That allows the team to go and be aggressive during the offseason.\"</p>— Jordan Bastian (@MLBastian) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The Cubs did get the tying run to the plate in the bottom of the ninth after Yan Gomes singled with one out, but McKinstry flied to left and Happ grounded out and that, as they say, was that.</p>\n<p>Alzolay and new infielder Esteban Quiroz (who pinch-hit and struck out in his MLB debut in the ninth) make 64 players who have been Cubs this year. Barring some sort of injury or COVID outbreak (which we hope doesn’t happen), they’re not going to challenge the record of 69, set last year.</p>\n<p>The day, though, belonged to Wesneski despite the loss; that was one of the best starts by any Cub in 2022. I mean... look at this pitch!</p>\n\n\n<p>Hayden Wesneski, White Castle Special.      pic.twitter.com/ZkcyK5AGtv</p>— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The Cubs will go for the series win Sunday at Wrigley Field. Javier Assad will start for the Cubs and Ryan Feltner will go for the Rockies. Game time is again 1:20 p.m. CT and TV coverage will be via Marquee Sports Network.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Dodgers left-hander Tyler Anderson has delivered all season, a first-time All-Star and rotation anchor who leads the team in innings. Now, he’ll get a few days off for another delivery.</p>\n<p>Anderson was placed on paternity leave on Saturday, with he and his wife Taitym welcoming their third child. </p>\n<p>The left-hander is 15-3 with a 2.62 ERA that ranks fifth in the National League. Anderson has 119 strikeouts and 32 walks in his 27 games and 161⅔ innings, the latter leading the Dodgers. Paternity leave, by rule, is a minimum of three days and a maximum of seven, so Anderson will be out until at least Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Anderson was in line to pitch Monday against the Diamondbacks at Dodger Stadium, but that won’t happen now. With Michael Grove inserted as a sixth starter last Wednesday plus Thursday’s scheduled off day, the team has plenty of room to maneuver the rotation. For instance, Clayton Kershaw last pitched Tuesday, and would still be on extra rest if he starts on Monday.</p>\n\n\n<p>Clayton Kershaw threw his bullpen session yesterday, good chance #Dodgers ace pitches Monday on 5 days rest. https://t.co/ictp5FXIDO</p>— David Vassegh (@THEREAL_DV) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The Dodgers have a split doubleheader against the D-backs on Tuesday. Grove would be on five days rest to start one of those games.</p>\n<p>In the interim, the Dodgers recalled Andre Jackson as an extra arm in the bullpen. This is the  fourth stint in the majors for Jackson, who was optioned to Triple-A on Wednesday. </p>\n\n<p>Jackson has pitched once for the Dodgers this season, throwing two scoreless innings last Sunday to close out a win in San Diego. The right-hander has struggled this year in Triple-A with a 5.00 ERA and 61 walks in 75⅔ innings to go with his 76 strikeouts. Though in his last seven outings with Oklahoma City, Jackson posted a 3.26 ERA and while his 19 walks in 30⅓ innings is still high, his 14.1-percent walk rate during that stretch is a marked improvement over his 19.1-percent walk rate in his first 14 games.</p>\nNotes\n<p>As foretold on Friday, Gavin Lux is starting at second base for the Dodgers on Saturday, batting ninth. It’s the first game since September 1 for Lux, who has been battling neck issues.</p>\n<p>Trayce Thompson gets the start in centerfield and Joey Gallo in left field for the Dodgers. John Brebbia starts for the Giants in what is expected to be a bullpen game for the home team.</p>\n<p>San Francisco made a few roster moves before the game. Pitcher Sean Hjelle was recalled from Triple-A Sacramento, with the 6’11 right-hander likely to take down innings on Saturday. Heliot Ramos was also called up from Triple-A, and starts in right field for the Giants.</p>\n<p>Pitcher Luis Ortiz, who recorded five outs in relief on Friday, and old friend Willie Calhoun were optioned to Sacramento.</p>",

        "description": "Benny Sieu-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>The Yankees look to get back on track against one of the Brewers’ studs</p> <p>Last night was a dumb loss for the Yankees, and even dumber when you factor in the assignment for the lineup tonight. Brandon Woodruff would be the best starter on a lot of teams in the game, and Aaron Judge and Co. have their work cut out for them in the second game of this weekend’s three-game set.</p>\n<p>Woodruff isn’t quite as dominant this season as he was last, but a 3.39 ERA with 3.22 FIP is nothing to sneeze at. If there’s been a chink in his armor this year, it’s a higher walk rate than last year, as he’s struggled at times to control the strike zone with his fastball. The Yankees are a disciplined team, but Woodruff is a tough matchup for them tonight.</p>\n<p>Jameson Taillon counters for the Yankees, still the platonic ideal of the average pitcher, with a 102 ERA- and 100 FIP-. His walk rate is impressive, but his biggest problem this season has been keeping the ball in the yard. The Brewers have hit the third-most home runs in the game, and being able to neutralize that power threat is likely the key to Taillon’s outing today.</p>\n<p>Jose Trevino, after leaving the game last night, is out of the lineup with Kyle Higashioka taking over behind the back plate. Oswald Peraza will make his first appearance since last Friday.</p>\n<p>Location: American Family Field— Milwaukee, WI</p>\n<p>First pitch: 7:10 pm ET</p>\n<p>TV broadcast: YES Network, Bally Sports Wisconsin, MLB Network (out-of-market only)</p>\n<p>Radio broadcast: WFAN 660/101.9, WADO 1280</p>\n<p>Online stream: MLB.tv (out-of-market only)</p>\n<p>For updates, follow us on Twitter and Instagram, and like us on Facebook.</p>\n\n\n<p>Saturday Showdown. #RepBX <br /><br />Presented by @Hilton pic.twitter.com/iAEvHbsPiC</p>— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Right back to it.<br /><br /> : @BallySportWI/@MLBNetwork <br /> : @620wtmj @fleet_farm | #ThisIsMyCrew pic.twitter.com/N88hrlwccu</p>— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

It’s still pretty impressive that he has put up a zero in 46 of the last 47 innings he has thrown. There’s also a case to be made that he has put up the best 10-game streak in franchise history, having gone 8-0 with a sub-one ERA (0.97) in that time. If you push it back one game, his ten games before the Colorado outing had an even lower ERA (0.82), though his record was 7-0. Either way, he’s the only starter with a sub-one ERA over ten consecutive starts for Arizona. The previous low was 1.09 by Randy Johnson, covering his last two games in 1999, then eight in 2000.</p>\n<p>Of course, there’s something to be said for the Big Unit’s streak too. Those ten games covered 82.1 inning, so on an average day he was working into the ninth inning! Five of them were complete games. In other words, during a ten-game period, Randy Johnson worked more “true” complete games i.e. excluding shortened ones, than the D-backs have thrown since the end of April 2017, a spell of more than nine hundred contests. Oh, yeah: and Randy had a totally different 10-game spell, in April and May 2000, where he also had five complete games, and a 1.25 ERA. He struck out 111 batters over 79.1 innings. That’s more than MadBum has fanned over all 29 of his starts this year (107). </p>\n<p>One area where Gallen does beat Johnson is in WHIP, where Zac’s 0.662 is better than Randy’s best of 0.777. The previous lowest for Arizona actually belonged to Dan Haren, who was at -.720 over ten starts in the 2009 campaign. Gallen’s is also the best in the majors this season, but is still a long way above Jacob DeGrom’s run last season. Over ten games in April-June, he allowed only nineteen hits - so averaged fewer than two per outing - and eight walks in 58 innings, for a WHIP of 0.466. That’s the best figure in recorded baseball history. But have one last contender: Bob Gibson in 1968. Ten starts. Ten complete games. 10-0 record. Eight shutouTwo earned runs in 90 IP. 0.20 ERA. Hard to beat that. </p>",

Time and again Kopech could have been skipped a day or a turn, to extend him and keep him strong for the season, but no. He was INJURED in warmups before his last IL stint and was sent out to the mound to pitch. Kopech has a nine-figure arm, but doesn’t have the organization to protect him. I’d say back to the bullpen for 2023, Michael, but we have ZERO starters ready to step up in 2022 beyond Dylan Cease/Lucas Giolito (sort of)/Lance Lynn (um), so, sorry, get strong in the offseason, buddy!</p>\n<p>Davis Martin is up with the team is starting today.

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/mariners-place-eugenio-suarez-on-10-day-injured-list.html",
        "description": "<p>The Mariners have placed third baseman Eugenio Suarez on the 10-day injured list due to a fracture in the tip of his right index finger, manager Scott Servais told reporters (including The Athletic’s Corey Brock, The Seattle Times’ Ryan Divish, and MLB.com’s Daniel Kramer).  Utilityman Dylan Moore has been activated from the 10-day IL to take Suarez’s roster spot, with Moore returning after about three weeks missed due to an oblique strain.</p>\n<p>More will likely be known about Suarez’s timeline after he visits a specialist on Monday, but for now, there is optimism that the fracture is minor enough that he’ll be able to return before the regular season is over.  However, he might be limited to designated hitter work if he is able to come back, as throwing is the biggest question mark for the right-handed Suarez.</p>\n<p>Losing Suarez is a big setback for a Mariners team that has been on a dream run for the last few months, positioning themselves to win a wild card and reach the postseason for the first time since 2001.  Beyond just making the playoffs, the M’s were looking to make a deep run into October, yet that will be a lot more difficult if Suarez is limited or perhaps unable to play whatsoever.</p>\n<p>After struggling in both the 2020 and 2021 seasons, Suarez became an expendable piece for the cost-cutting Reds, who dealt Suarez and Jesse Winker to Seattle in March for a package of four younger players.  Ironically, Winker was seen as the big get at the time, as Suarez’s inclusion in the deal was largely seen as a contract the Mariners had to absorb in order to pry Winker out of Cincinnati.</p>\n<p>As it has turned out, Winker has delivered roughly league-average offense in 2022, while Suarez has bounced back to become one of the Mariners’ top bats.  The third baseman has hit .235/.335/.470 with 31 home runs over 594 plate appearances, translating to a 133 OPS+/135 wRC+.  Though Suarez has a league-high 183 strikeouts, he has been crushing the ball when he has made contact, and his 12% walk rate is in the 90th percentile of all players.  Beyond the offensive production, Suarez has also been something of an unexpected benefit at third base, with positive grades (+1 Outs Above Average, +3 Defensive Runs Saved, +2.1 UZR/150) from several public defensive metrics.</p>\n<p>Only 25 position players have a higher fWAR than Suarez’s 4.4 number, making him a difficult player for the Mariners to feasibly replace.  If he is able to return as a DH and keep on hitting, the M’s would be more than pleased with that outcome — given how Carlos Santana has been inconsistent as the team’s regular designated hitter, Suarez might even be an upgrade in the role.</p>\n<p>Third base is another story, as Moore and Abraham Toro figure to be the top options in the short term.  Servais said that Jake Lamb will also get some work at the hot corner, and regular first baseman Ty France also took some grounders at third base today.  France has past experience as a third baseman but he hasn’t played the position at all this season, and made only 11 appearances at third base in 2020-21.</p>",

        "description": "The performance from GUNNAR HENDERSON and his fellow rookies was the bright spot Saturday.  | Photo by Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>While the bats were far from quiet Saturday, the O’s still couldn’t muster enough offense to get past the Jays. </p> <p>Before September started, the feeling around Birdland was that the Orioles were good enough to overtake to Blue Jays in the wild card race. The O’s continued to prove that feeling wrong Saturday, losing for the fifth time in six September games against Toronto. </p>\n<p>The storyline that’s haunted Baltimore throughout the last month is the way their bats have gone quiet at the worst possible times. The scoreline may not have reflected it, but the bats were hardly quiet on Saturday. </p>\n<p>In the first inning alone, the O’s put good wood on the baseball three times. Leading off the game, Cedric Mullins hit a ball to left field that looked like it might leave, before Raimel Tapia snagged it against the fence. Adley Rutschman followed by rocketing a ball through the infield for a single, only for Anthony Santander to hit sharply into a double play. </p>\n<p>That was the story of the day offensively for the Orioles: plenty of good contact, spraying the ball all over the field, but often ending the inning with nothing to show for it. In each of the first five innings, Baltimore had a runner on with one or fewer outs. In only one of those innings did the Orioles score. </p>\n<p>In fact, in both the second and third, the Birds had exactly the same scoring threat: runners on second and third, only one out. In the second, the bats completely fell flat. Rougned Odor popped out to second before Kyle Stowers struck out to end the inning. </p>\n<p>In the third, two of the newest Orioles showed Birdland this team is still capable of timely hitting. After Jesus Aguilar reached on catcher’s interference, rookie sensation GUNNAR HENDERSON hit a laser through the right side of the infield—scoring two, leaving the O’s with first and third, and only down 3-2. Fellow rookie Terrin Vavra then lifted a ball to center field, but it wasn’t deep enough for Aguilar to score from third. </p>\n<p>On the day, the rookie bats certainly outshined the veterans by a wide margin. After HENDERSON opened the scoring in the third, Vavra pushed across the only other Orioles run (scoring HENDERSON) with a single in the eighth. Rutschman, HENDERSON and Vavra each registered two hits, the latter two both collecting a double. Outfielder Kyle Stowers was the only rookie in the lineup that didn’t register a hit. </p>\n<p>In stark contrast, the six veteran bats the Orioles sent to the plate Saturday combined to go 3-19 (.158) with only one extra-base hit. This showing from the vets also came with noted Blue Jays masher Ryan Mountcastle leaving the game in the third after being hit by a pitch in the elbow. </p>\n<p>Knowing that the offense is usually slow to get going, most Oriole fans hoped that starter Kyle Bradish could keep this Blue Jays offense at bay early on. That is not what happened. The rookie right-hander gave up singles to the Jays’ first two batters, and George Springer came around to score on a Teoscar Hernandez single in the first. Things did not get better for Bradish in the second. After giving up two singles, Springer launched a chest-high fastball 393 feet, barely missing a three-run HR and instead settling for a two-run double. </p>\n<p>Bradish would settle down in the third and fourth, getting through the Blue Jays lineup 1-2-3 in both frames. Despite the rough start, the rookie looked to truly be turning the afternoon around—until Brandon Hyde gave him a questionable early hook. </p>\n<p>In the fifth, Bradish would have put up his third consecutive 1-2-3 inning, except for a Ramon Urias error that allowed Vlad Guerrero Jr. to reach base. Instead, with two outs, Bradish walked Matt Chapman to put runners at first and second with Teoscar Hernandez coming to the plate. Instead of leaving him to face Hernandez, Hyder pulled his starter and brought in sidewinder Jake Reed from the bullpen. Reed would go on to walk the bases loaded, before giving up a bases-clearing double to Tapia, leaving the O’s down 6-2. </p>\n<p>It’s hard not to wonder if the game might have stayed close if Bradish stayed in to face Hernandez. He had only thrown 80 pitches to that point, struck Hernandez out in his first AB and seemingly deserved the benefit of the doubt given his recent performances. Instead, Bradish got stuck with a loss, and a scoreline—4.2 innings pitches, 5 runs (three earned)—that doesn’t speak to the true impact Bradish made on Saturday. </p>\n<p>In keeping with the trend of rookies outshining veteran players, DL Hall gave the Orioles a strong relief appearance in the sixth inning. The flame-throwing lefty worked a clean inning, striking out one and showing strong command of his breaking pitches. HENDERSON also turned an excellent double-play in seventh on a ball hit sharply up the middle. </p>\n<p>While the Labor Day Letdown in Baltimore put the O’s playoff chances on life support, losses in these first two games in Toronto are probably the losses that pull the plug. Still, when your rookie class shines as brightly as Rutschman, HENDERSON, Vavra and Bradish did Saturday—even in a loss—it’s enough to keep Birdland hopeful amidst this disappointment. </p>\n<p>The O’s probably won’t be playing deep into October this year. And yet, with the foundation they’ve already established in 2022, this time next year should bring a very different story. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "Photo By Winslow Townson/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The Red Sox do not look like a good team.</p> <p>Stop me if you’ve heard this before. Actually, don’t, because you’ve heard it a bunch of times this year, but Brady Singer pitched very well again today. His ERA as a starter this year is now at 2.93. At what point do we stop saying it’s a small sample size? At what point do we stop adding caveats so that we can insist he isn’t an ace? Six shutout innings with five strikeouts and only one walk and five hits. That will play every day of the week.</p>\n<p>He only had one inning that saw him in any kind of danger; in the third he loaded the bases with no outs but induced a popup, a strikeout and another pop out to escape the jam entirely unscathed. He still looked plenty strong in the sixth inning, too, but didn’t come back for the seventh. There are a multitude of reasons as to why that was a good decision, but don’t hold it against Singer that he only pitched six today.</p>\n<p>After only scoring one run last night, the Royals’ offense came to life with the re-addition of Edward Olivares. Seven starters had at least one hit (and six had two or more,) six hitters scored at least one run, and five drove in a run. The Royals top four were 10-for-20 on the day. There weren’t any home runs and there were a lot of singles, but more than one of those would have been doubles or triples in any other stadium.</p>\n<p>At the top of the TV broadcast, the Royals announcers informed us that the Royals’ reasoning for sending Nick Pratto back to AAA was because he needed to be getting regular at-bats and, darnit, he just wasn’t getting those in the big leagues. Of course, none of the Royals’ leadership has any control over things. And Michael A. Taylor and Hunter Dozier proved how important they were to the lineup by going a combined 0-for-9 with a walk and a run scored. Thems the breaks, I guess.</p>\nNotes\n\nMJ Melendez became the first Royals catcher in history to score four runs in a single game. The TV broadcast announced that he was probably the first catcher to lead-off and score four runs in the same game in baseball history, but didn’t come up with a definitive answer before the end of the game.\nEdward Olivares continues to do nothing but hit, adding two more in his first game since going to the 60-day-IL with a leg injury.\nVinnie Pasquantino tacked on three hits and three RBIs including a double and a pair of singles through the shift.\nIf you wanted a preview of what baseball might be like, next season, with the pitch clock look no further than the first four innings of this game. Brady Singer and Rich Hill were both pitching at very fast tempos and we completed those innings less than an hour after first pitch. I don’t know about you, but I enjoyed getting to watch more baseball in a smaller amount of time for those first four innings.\nBrad Keller and Carlos Hernández both added scoreless innings in relief. So did Anthony Misiewicz but the first two had struggled after first converting out of the rotation and have looked more impressive lately. They’re both still failing to strike out batters, however.\n\n<p>The Royals will look to win the series tomorrow afternoon at 12:35 CT. Kris Bubic will try to follow the strong starts of Brady Singer and Jonathan Heasley. The Red Sox will send journeyman Nick Pivetta to the mound.</p>",

        "description": "“One must face the despicable vanity which is at the root of all this niggling and haggling.”\n\n<p></p><p>“The most regretful people on earth,” Mary Oliver wrote as she distilled a lifetime of wisdom on creativity, “are those who felt the call to creative work, who felt their own creative power restive and uprising, and gave to it neither power nor time.” </p>\n<p>Nearly a century before her, the young Virginia Woolf (January 25, 1882–March 28, 1941) was yet to wander through her garden and arrive at her flower-fomented epiphany about what it means to be an artist. She was already making a living by her pen, but she was catering rather than creating, writing book reviews and essays for various literary journals — miniatures of her mind, which pulsated with something larger, with its “own creative power restive and uprising,” leaving her raw with self-doubt, the way we always are in those threshold moments before some great leap into our own depths. </p>\nVirginia Woolf\n<p>In the springtime of her twenty-ninth year, long before To the Lighthouse and Orlando were but ink drops of thought at the tip of her pen, Virginia writes in her diary:</p>\n<p>Well, you see, I’m a failure as a writer. I’m out of fashion: old: shan’t do any better: have no headpiece: the spring is everywhere: my book out (prematurely) and nipped, a damp firework.</p>\n<p>With an eye to the commercial work syphoning her energy and talent — the era’s equivalent of “content” — she resolves:</p>\n<p>I shan’t become a machine, unless a machine for grinding articles. As I write, there rises somewhere in my head that queer and very pleasant sense of something which I want to write; my own point of view. I wonder, though, whether this feeling that I write for half a dozen instead of 1500 will pervert this? — make me eccentric — no, I think not.</p>\n<p>Long before Bertrand Russell reflected on how to grow older contentedly, counseling that you must “make your interests gradually wider and more impersonal, until bit by bit the walls of the ego recede, and your life becomes increasingly merged in the universal life,” Virginia adds:</p>\n<p>One must face the despicable vanity which is at the root of all this niggling and haggling. I think the only prescription for me is to have a thousand interests — if one is damaged, to be able instantly to let my energy flow into Russian, or Greek, or the press, or the garden, or people, or some activity disconnected with my own writing.</p>\n<p>These fragments appear in A Writer’s Diary (public library) — the magnificent posthumous volume that gave us Virginia’s reflections on the relationship between loneliness and creativity, what makes love last, the consolations of growing older, the creative benefits of keeping a diary, and her arresting account of a total solar eclipse.</p>\n<p>Couple with Keith Haring on self-doubt, then revisit the story of how John Steinbeck used the diary as a tool of creative self-actualization, paving his own way to the Nobel Prize, and Whitman on the discipline of creative self-esteem. </p>\ndonating = loving<p>For a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the unbearable name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years). It has remained free and ad-free and alive thanks to patronage from readers. I have no staff, no interns, no assistant — a thoroughly one-woman labor of love that is also my life and my livelihood.

        "description": "<p>Jamelle Bouie: “The conceit of this dehumanizing bit of political theater was that the liberal denizens of Martha’s Vineyard would reject the migrants out of hypocrisy, thus proving that Democrats aren’t actually interested in welcoming immigrants into their communities. To DeSantis and his amen corner, asylum seekers are disposable, and they believe that liberals will want to dispose of them too.”</p>\n<p>“What happened, instead, was that residents of Martha’s Vineyard rallied to provide food, shelter, clothing and services. The asylum seekers are now on their way to Cape Cod, to receive further assistance. The stunt failed to make its intended point.”</p>\n<p>“The same was true of a previous stunt, in which DeSantis touted the arrests of 20 former felons for election fraud. The intended message was that Florida, and presumably the entire country, needed to be on constant alert to block fraudulent voters. But in the days and weeks after the arrests, an investigation by The Tampa Bay Times found that the state had actually cleared those residents to vote.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the weeks following the Supreme Court striking down Roe v. Wade, cruel and heartbreaking stories have dominated the headlines. From women who have experienced a miscarriage and could not get timely treatment, to a 10-year-old rape victim who had to flee her state to receive life-saving medical attention, to countless others who can no longer make fundamental decisions about their health care. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stories illustrate our grim new reality: without federal protections in place, your ability to access reproductive care now depends on where you live. Key electoral battlegrounds like Michigan and New Mexico tell the tale of two Americas. In one, abortion access hangs in the balance; in the other, it’s protected. For Democratic state lawmakers like us, these stories also serve as powerful reminders of what’s at stake in state legislative races across the country this fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one end of the spectrum, Republican state lawmakers are aggressively carrying out their assaults on reproductive rights and health care. In places like Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, and Texas, where Republicans have a stranglehold on state legislatures, abortion bans have already passed, threatening the freedom and safety of millions of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In stark contrast, Democratic legislatures in New Mexico, Colorado, and New Jersey have taken crucial steps to protect the rights of their citizens. In these safe havens, abortion and all other reproductive health care services remain legal. Some clinics have even announced plans to relocate to these states to provide care for those who live there and people who must travel from red states. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In New Mexico, this is only possible because, in 2021, our Democratic legislative majority and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) repealed an abortion ban that had been on the books since 1969, ensuring it would not become enforceable again if Roe fell. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We cannot overstate the importance of this victory. If we had not removed this ban, New Mexicans at any stage of pregnancy could have been denied health care, and anyone who performed an abortion or assisted with the process could have been charged with a crime. And in the most extreme circumstances of need, patients might have been forced to beg a panel of strangers for permission to have an abortion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In far too many states across the country, this nightmare scenario is on the verge of becoming reality. Take Michigan, for instance. While the state leans blue, Republicans narrowly control the state legislature. Despite the brave leadership of our Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Republican lawmakers are working relentlessly to restrict reproductive care and enforce an outdated and deeply unpopular abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest, a ban that has been on the books since 1931. The Republican majority has even introduced new legislation that would send doctors who provide abortion care to jail for 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, Michigan Democrats are fighting back. We are working to strike the extreme 1931 ban from the books, pass the Reproductive Health Act to affirm and protect abortion rights, and support a citizen-led ballot measure to protect reproductive freedom. We are also working to elect great candidates like Carol Glanville — a reproductive rights champion who won a special election earlier this year in a district Donald Trump won by 16 points and is running for reelection this fall against an anti-abortion candidate. With candidates like Glanville, we have the potential to shift the direction of our state legislature and ensure Michiganders’ rights are protected.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poll after poll — and the overwhelming defeat of an anti-abortion amendment in ruby-red Kansas —  show that a majority of Americans want abortion to remain safe and legal. But a vocal and well-funded right-wing minority has poured dark money into state legislative races for far too many years, creating gerrymandered legislative majorities to try and inoculate Republicans from public opinion. We must keep fighting back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abortion access and so many other critical issues are on the ballot this fall. States have the power to protect reproductive rights, voting rights, and our environment. We cannot afford to sit this election out while Republicans undermine the will of the people by abolishing our fundamental freedoms state by state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian Egolf is speaker of the New Mexico House and Donna Lasinski is Michigan House Democratic leader.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Juan Ocampo/NBAE via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>It does not seem like Isaiah Thomas is bound for a third stint in purple and gold.</p> <p>Earlier on Saturday, Michael Scotto of Hoopshype broke the news that the Los Angeles Lakers had finally realized they’re a little short on wings, and had thus brought in free agents Jeremy Lamb, Dwayne Bacon, Miye Oni and Shabazz Muhammad for workouts recently. Shortly afterward, he followed that up with another report that Isaiah Thomas, Armoni Brooks, Sharife Cooper and Mychal Mulder had also worked out for the team.</p>\n<p>Normally this would be pretty standard, dead days of the offseason news as teams look to fill out their final roster spots. The one complication in this specific case? Thomas soon took to Twitter to deny he ever participated in such a workout:</p>\n\n\n<p>No I didn’t workout for the lakers!!!! What SOURCE told you that?? Smh https://t.co/KY0mOZgY2j</p>— Isaiah Thomas (@isaiahthomas) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>That makes sense in some ways, because the Lakers have already had Isaiah Thomas on their team twice with Rob Pelinka as general manager, once when they traded for his contract to clear cap space for LeBron James in 2018, and once on a 10-day contract while the team was ravaged by health and safety protocols absences last season. It would be pretty weird if they needed to see him in an open gym setting to evaluate what he could or couldn’t bring at this point. </p>\n<p>Still, this is the team that has hosted approximately 97 workouts and recruiting dinners for Darren Collison, so who knows. Maybe Pelinka just really loves watching tiny guards play. It would certainly explain why the Lakers continue to sign so many.</p>\n<p>But I digress. I tried to think about possible reasons for literally anyone to lie about an Isaiah Thomas September free-agent workout in 2022 and now my brain hurts, so we’ll just chalk this up to Schrodinger’s workout, since it’s unlikely to mean much of anything either way.</p>\n<p>All that aside, do any of these names excite you at all for the team’s final open training roster spot? Feel free to sound off in the comments below. </p>\n<p>For more Lakers talk, subscribe to the Silver Screen and Roll podcast feed on iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher or Google Podcasts.

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/athletics-to-promote-jordan-diaz.html",
        "description": "<p>Sep. 18: The A’s have announced the promotion of Diaz, with outfielder Ramón Laureano headed to the 10-day injured list with a right hamstring strain in a corresponding move. The severity of the injury isn’t clear, but with just over two weeks remaining on the schedule, it’s possible that Laureano’s season is over. He returned from serving an 80-game PED suspension in May and has hit .211/.287/.376 this year with 13 home runs and 11 stolen bases.</p>\n<p>Sep. 17: The Athletics are preparing to call up prospect Jordan Diaz, according to Daniel Alvarez-Montes of El Extrabase (Twitter link).  Oakland already added Diaz to the 40-man roster during the offseason, so they’ll just need to make one move to add Diaz to the active roster.</p>\n<p>The 22-year-old Diaz will be making his Major League debut, six years after signing with the A’s for a fairly modest $275K bonus during the 2016-17 international signing period.  After showing flashes of his potential at the plate in 2017-19, Diaz returned from the lost 2020 minor league season to hit .288/.337/.484 with 13 homers over 365 plate appearances at high-A ball in 2021.  Beginning 2022 in Double-A, Diaz has just kept on hitting, with a combined .326/.366/.515 slash line with 19 home runs at Double-A Midland (407 PA) and Triple-A Las Vegas (120 PA).</p>\n<p>This hitting prowess has been Diaz’s calling card, with evaluators impressed by his polish and his increasing power, though he doesn’t take walks all that often.  Diaz has yet to settle into a defensive role, as he began his career as a third baseman but has increasingly seen more time at first base (plus a handful of games as a second base and left fielder).  If Diaz is just a first base/DH-only type, he’ll need to deliver even more at the plate to make up for these defensive limitations.  The A’s will probably give him at look at both corner infield spots over the final two weeks of the regular season.</p>\n<p>MLB Pipeline ranks Diaz eighth on its list of Oakland’s top prospects, while Baseball America is a bit less bullish in rating Diaz 17th.  Also of note, BA’s scouting report writes that “opposing teams have coveted Diaz in trade talks in the past,” so it’s fair to assume that rival scouts will be paying some extra attention to Diaz’s first exposure to Major League pitching.  The rebuilding A’s are more in a position to be adding rather than subtracting any quality youngsters from their organization, though Billy Beane’s front office has been known to swing some creative deals.</p>",

To DeSantis and his amen corner, asylum seekers are disposable, and they believe that liberals will want to dispose of them too.”</p>\n<p>“What happened, instead, was that residents of Martha’s Vineyard rallied to provide food, shelter, clothing and services. The asylum seekers are now on their way to Cape Cod, to receive further assistance. The stunt failed to make its intended point.”</p>\n<p>“The same was true of a previous stunt, in which DeSantis touted the arrests of 20 former felons for election fraud. The intended message was that Florida, and presumably the entire country, needed to be on constant alert to block fraudulent voters. But in the days and weeks after the arrests, an investigation by The Tampa Bay Times found that the state had actually cleared those residents to vote.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>My old friend and former Home and School colleague Heather Mullen is running for school trustee in Charlottetown:</p>\n\n<p>Today I went outside my comfort zone to become a candidate for a public election. I did this because the public education system in PEl is very important to me. I will be running in the Charlottetown area (I moved to town this spring) however my time with PEI Home and School Federation has taught me the importance of representing the needs of students, schools, and staff across PEl and I will continue to listen to those concerns. I hope wherever you live in PEI, you would consider being involved in the Public Schools Branch election, either as a candidate or by voting.</p>\n\n<p>Heather is a dynamo: smart, progressive, organized, compassionate. She took the school food program baton handed to her when she became President of the PEI Home and School Federation and, with enormous dedication, expenditure of her own time, and deftly building a focused team of others, took it to the finish line. </p>\n<p>I’ve every confidence she’ll take the same energy and passion to her role as school trustee. </p>\n<p>The process for voting in this election is more involved than you might expect it to be: all electors need to apply for a mail-in ballot before October 9, 2022. It’s not difficult and will only take a moment. It’s worth it to ensure we have a school board with a strong mandate. </p>",

        "description": "iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max have started to arrive to customers around the world. For those who have upgraded to one of the devices, we have put together a list of 10 useful settings that are worth checking out below.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome of the settings are exclusive to the iPhone 14 Pro models, while others were introduced in iOS 16 for a wider range of iPhones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNew Settings for iPhone 14 Pro Models\r<br />\nEnable 48MP ProRAW Photos\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 14 Pro models feature an upgraded rear camera system that can shoot 48-megapixel photos, but only in ProRAW mode, which can be enabled in the Settings app under Camera → Formats → Apple ProRAW with the resolution set to 48MP. In the Camera app, a button labeled RAW will appear in the top-right corner to easily turn ProRAW on or off.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nProRAW photos retain more detail in the image file for more editing flexibility. 48-megapixel ProRAW photos are very large files that clock in at around 75MB each or higher, so be mindful of your iPhone's storage space if shooting photos in this mode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEnable 4K Cinematic Mode\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn all four iPhone 14 models, Cinematic mode videos can now be recorded in 4K. To enable the higher resolution in the Settings app, tap Camera → Record Cinematic and choose 4K at 24 frames per second or 4K at 30 frames per second.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIntroduced with the iPhone 13 lineup, Cinematic mode features a depth effect with automatic focus changes for \"cinema-style\" videos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOptimize Action Mode for Lower Light\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four iPhone 14 models feature a new Action mode that adjusts to significant shakes, motion, and vibrations for smoother-looking video. Apple says the feature can be used to record video while off-roading in a vehicle, filming a runner, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA button for Action mode can be found in the top-left corner of the Camera app for video. In the Settings app, Action mode can be optimized for lower-light conditions by navigating to Camera → Record Video → Action Mode Lower Light. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nTurn On a Startup Sound\r<br />\n<p>iPhone 14: Startup &amp; Shutdown Chimes! pic.twitter.com/ThOaLgO045</p>— Martin Nobel (@MartinNobel_) September 17, 2022 \r<br />\nAn optional new accessibility feature allows all iPhone 14 models to play a sound when powered on and powered off. The feature can be enabled in the Settings app under Accessibility → Audio/Visual → Power On &amp; Off Sounds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTurn Off the Always-On Display\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 14 Pro's new always-on display mode is enabled by default. It can be turned off in the Settings app under Display &amp; Brightness → Always On.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlways-on display mode dims the entire Lock Screen, but still shows the time, date, widgets, wallpaper, and unread notifications. Once you raise the iPhone, tap or swipe up on the bottom of the screen, or press the side button, the display returns to normal brightness.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNew Settings in iOS 16\r<br />\nTurn On Haptic Feedback for Keyboard\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 16 added a new haptic feedback option for the iPhone's stock keyboard. Similar to many Android smartphones, the iPhone can make a slight vibration after each key that you press while typing, providing physical confirmation that the key was tapped.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the Settings app, the feature is under Sounds &amp; Haptics → Keyboard Feedback → Haptic.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAdd a Battery Percentage Icon to Status Bar\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 16 finally reintroduced the option to view a battery percentage icon in the status bar on the iPhone X and newer, eliminating the need to swipe down to open Control Center to see the percentage. To enable the new icon on iPhone 14 Pro models, open the Settings app and navigate to Battery → Battery Percentage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAutomatically Send Messages With Siri\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSiri normally asks for confirmation before sending a message to someone, but in iOS 16, there is a new option to skip the confirmation step. To enable this in the Settings app, tap Siri &amp; Search → Automatically Send Messages.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe feature can also be enabled when an iPhone is connected to headphones or CarPlay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAsk Siri to Hang Up a Phone Call\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith iOS 16, you can say \"Hey Siri, hang up\" during a phone call to end the call in a hands-free manner, but note that the command can be heard by others on the call. In the Settings app, this feature can be enabled under Siri &amp; Search → Call Hang Up.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nView Wi-Fi Passwords\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can finally view the password of a Wi-Fi network that you have previously connected to on iOS 16. In the Settings app, tap Wi-Fi → tap a network → tap the password field and authenticate with Face ID to view the password.Related Roundups: iOS 16, iPadOS 16, iPhone 14 ProBuyer's Guide: iPhone 14 Pro (Buy Now)Related Forums: iOS 16, iPhone<br />This article, \"10 Settings to Check Out on iPhone 14 Pro\" first appeared on MacRumors.com<br /><br />Discuss this article in our forums<br /><br />",

        "description": "<p>Officials concluded their investigation into the car accident that killed Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.) last month, determining that the car her staff member was driving was responsible for the crash. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Elkhart County Sheriff’s Office said in a release on Friday that the cause of the accident was that the Toyota RAV4 that staffer Zachery Potts was driving northbound when he veered into the southbound lane while trying to pass a flat-bed truck. The Toyota collided with a Buick traveling southbound as Potts attempted to pass the truck. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The office also concluded that excessive speed played a role in the accident. Evidence from the reconstruction of the crash showed that the Toyota was traveling at 82 miles per hour about five seconds before the collision occurred. The vehicle was “coasting” and dropped to 77 miles per hour milliseconds before the airbags deployed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The crash occurred on Aug. 3 around 12:30 p.m., killing Walorski, Potts and Emma Thomson, Walorski’s communications director. The driver of the Buick, Edith Schmucker, was also killed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Elkhart County coroner ruled that Walorski’s death was accidental and caused by the dislocation of the cervical spine as a result of the accident. Potts, Thomson and Schmucker died from multiple injuries sustained in the crash, the coroner ruled. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police changed their initial description of what happened one day after the crash, announcing that the car Walorski was a passenger in crossed the state highway’s centerline and caused the head-on crash. Officials had originally said Schmucker’s car crossed into the Toyota’s path. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sheriff’s office release states that airbag control module data shows that Potts steered the Toyota to the left just before the crash. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investigators did not find any evidence of cell phones being used prior to the crash after reviewing cell phone information from all occupants of both vehicles. They also did not find any evidence of mechanical failures. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“All of the evidence and information gathered is consistent with someone attempting to pass another vehicle on a two-lane roadway,” the release states. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sheriff’s office consulted with Indiana State Police for an independent review of the evidence, and the police department came to the same conclusions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walorski had represented Indiana’s 2nd Congressional District since 2013 and was running for reelection this year. A special election will be held in November to fill her seat for the remainder of the term simultaneously with a general election to determine who will hold the seat for the next two years.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Starling Marte attempted to start some baseball activities a few days ago, but the outfielder told reporters (including MLB.com’s Anthony DiComo) that the hitting and throwing drills were stopped since Marte’s fractured right middle finger “was still bothering me a good amount.”  Since Marte’s injured-list placement was retroactive to September 7, he won’t be activated after just the minimum 10 days, and it isn’t yet certain when or even if Marte could be back before the end of the regular season.</p>\n<p>For his part, Marte feels he will be able to play again, though manager Buck Showalter was more circumspect about the possibility.  Naturally, getting Marte back onto the field as soon as possible would be ideal for all parties, especially if he can get some swings under his belt to ensure that his finger is fully healed heading into the playoffs.  But, with a postseason trip all but officially assured, the team isn’t going to rush Marte back, since a re-aggravation of the injury could threaten his availability for October.</p>\n<p>The Mets are trying to hold off the Braves for first place in the NL East, and the division crown carries even more importance given the new playoff format.  While a late surge from the NL Central-leading Cardinals can’t be ruled out, the NL East winner is likely to finish with the second-best record in the National League, and will thus earn a first-round bye.  That bye is valuable for countless reasons, including the fact that getting over a full week off would allow a team more time to get its players (like Marte) rested and recovered from injuries.  Of course, not having Marte available will make it all the more difficult for New York to stay ahead of Atlanta down the stretch.</p>\n<p>While Marte’s status is still a question mark, the Mets are at least getting some reinforcements back on the pitching side.  Max Scherzer is tentatively scheduled to be activated from the 15-day IL in time to start Monday’s game against the Brewers, and Tylor Megill is also slated to be activated from the 60-day IL when the series begins in Milwaukee.</p>\n<p>Megill suffered a shoulder strain in mid-June, and after starting all 27 games of his brief MLB career, the righty is being targeted for a bullpen role upon his return.  Between his shoulder injury and another long-month IL stint due to biceps inflammation, Megill has barely pitched in 2022, with just 41 1/3 innings over his nine appearances.  While his SIERA is an impressive 3.28 and his strikeout and walk rates are both above-average, Megill’s real-world numbers include a 5.01 ERA.</p>\n<p>The Mets also welcomed righty reliever Stephen Nogosek back from the 15-day IL today, and played Mychal Givens on the injured list in the corresponding move.  There was no stated reason for Givens’ placement, indicating that the right-hander has been placed on the COVID-related version of the IL.  It isn’t known if Givens has tested positive for COVID-19, or is just suffering from symptoms.</p>\n<p>Nogosek has missed the last four weeks due to an oblique strain.  Now in his third MLB season, Nogosek has a career-high 19 1/3 innings, and a solid 2.79 ERA.  New York has shuttled Nogosek up and down from Triple-A on multiple occasions this year, but with the Triple-A season almost over, Nogosek figures to stick in the majors and provide more depth in the Mets’ bullpen.</p>",

More than 440 bodies have been discovered by Ukrainian officials, with some found with their hands tied behind their backs.</p><p>Satellite imagery has emerged of the recently discovered mass grave site near Izium. The images, released by Maxar Technologies, show the “Forest Cemetery” entrance from March to August of this year.</p><p>One of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant’s four main power lines has been repaired and is supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid two weeks after it went down, the UN nuclear watchdog has said. Even though the six reactors at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, have been shut down, the plant needs electricity to keep them cool.</p><p>US president Joe Biden urged Russian president Vladimir Putin to not use tactical nuclear or chemical weapons in the wake of setbacks in Ukraine. Asked by CBS what he would say to Putin if he was considering using such weapons, Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. It would change the face of war unlike anything since world war two.” Biden said the US response would be “consequential,” but declined to give detail. </p><p>Indian prime minister Narendra Modi told Putin on Saturday that “today’s time is not a time for war” when the pair met during a regional Asia summit in Uzbekistan. Putin told Modi he knew of India’s “concerns” about the conflict, echoing language he had used with Chinese president Xi Jinping the day before. “We will do our best to end this as soon as possible,” Putin said, while accusing Kyiv of rejecting negotiations.</p><p>Speaking to reporters later, Putin vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine despite Kyiv’s latest counteroffensive and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces target facilities in Russia. Associated Press reported that the Russian president said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. “We aren’t in a rush,” he said after the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting in Samarkand.</p><p>Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, told leaders at the summit that efforts were being made “to finalise the conflict in Ukraine through diplomacy as soon as possible”. Putin told Erdogan, who has been a key broker in limited deals between Russia and Ukraine, that Moscow was keen to build closer ties with Turkey and was ready to “significantly increase” all exports to the country.</p><p>Activists from environmental group Greenpeace on Saturday blocked a shipment of Russian gas from unloading at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in northern Finland, the terminal owner and Greenpeace said. The activists demanded Helsinki stop importing Russian gas after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.</p><p>The security service of Ukraine said that Russia’s federal security service (FSU) officers tortured residents in Kupiansk, a city in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The Kyiv Independent reports that when FSU officers were in then-occupied Kupiansk, they tortured residents and threatened to send them to minefields and kill their families.</p> Continue reading...",

To fill the vacant 28-man roster spot, Rylan Bannon has been called up from Triple-A Gwinnett. Bannon has bounced around this season, having begun the year with the Orioles before being placed on waivers and claimed by the Dodgers and then the Braves in mid-August. In 81 at-bats at the Braves’ top-level affiliate, the righty has slashed .323/.432/.477, good for a .909 OPS.</p>\n<p>SEPTEMBER 17TH: In just his second game back since being activated off the 60-day injured list, Braves second baseman Ozzie Albies suffered a fractured right pinky finger in tonight’s game against the Phillies.  The injury occurred during a slide into second base in the fourth inning, and Albies was replaced by Vaughn Grissom at second base for the top of the fifth.</p>\n<p>The severity of the injury isn’t yet known, though the fact that initial x-rays determined the problem before the game was over could indicate more than just a small fracture.  It would seem like Albies’ 2022 season could be over, perhaps even if Atlanta made another run to the World Series.</p>\n<p>Albies was a big contributor to last year’s championship team, earning his second career All-Star and Silver Slugger honors while also finishing 13th in NL MVP voting.  However, Albies was off to a relatively slow start over the 2022 campaign’s first two months before he suffered a left foot fracture on June 13 and had to undergo surgery.  As noted, Albies was sidelined until just yesterday, when he went 1-for-4 with two RBI in Atlanta’s 7-2 win over Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>The Braves have managed to thrive even without Albies for much of the season, and Grissom has somewhat unexpectedly stepped up as an immediate contributor after being promoted from Double-A a little over a month ago.  Grissom has hit .304/.355/.482 over his first 121 plate appearances in the majors, leading to some speculation that the Braves would try Grissom in left field in order to keep his hot bat in the lineup.  However, it seems as though opposing pitchers have started to adjust to Grissom, as the rookie has only a .607 OPS over his last 67 PA.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, in the wake of Albies’ injury, it would seem like Grissom will now again be the top choice at second base for the remainder of the regular season and postseason.  Orlando Arcia is also on hand to provide depth, and Ehire Adrianza is also on hand, but currently on the IL himself due to a quad strain.  Pat Valaika, Hernan Perez, and Ryan Goins are some of the Triple-A options with MLB experience, though Atlanta could have to add any of those players to the 40-man roster.</p>\n<p>It was less than a year ago that the Braves overcame the odds by winning the World Series despite losing a star player (Acuna) to injury for much of the season and throughout the playoffs.  While the book isn’t yet closed on Albies’ possible availability in the postseason, his absence for at least a few weeks will make it harder for the Braves to overtake the Mets in the NL East, and potentially capture a first-round bye.  The NL East runner-up is all but guaranteed to be the NL’s top wild card team and thus is set to host all three games (if necessary) of the Wild Card Series, yet Atlanta would obviously love to avoid those extra games and an extra chance of elimination.</p>",

Space is hostile to life, with its incredibly low temperatures, intense vacuum, and high levels of ionizing radiation.  Recently, scientists grew a cabbage plant called “rocket” on The International Space Station. Unfortunately, the rocket cabbage did not perform as expected during growth and experimentation, so the researchers then set their sights on understanding what was going on inside the plant cells that made this happen. Dr. Chandler and his coworkers, at Royal Holloway University in the UK, answered this ...<br />\nRead in browser »<br />\n <br />\n<br />\n\nA Beef-Loving SciMom’s Guide to Eating Less Meat\nBy Layla Katiraee on Aug 15, 2022 09:34 am<br />\nWhy is there such push back against dietary changes to support climate change?

Every year, about 15 million metric tons of plastic enter the oceans, equal to the weight of two million elephants! Around three-quarters of this debris ends up in the deep oceans. Scientists are concerned about the effects these deep sea plastics may have on marine ecosystems. However, deep-sea plastics are difficult to study and expensive to sample. Two geochemists from China recently took the manned submersible Shenhaiyongshi to the bottom of the South China ...<br />\nRead in browser »<br />\n <br />\n<br />\n\nNew research could make lithium

        "description": "Photo by Rey Del Rio/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The Tigers played a solid game, but the offense couldn’t come through late. </p> <p>After winning in extras on Friday, the Tigers were on the losing end Saturday after a pretty well played game from both sides, falling 4-3 in 11 innings.</p>\n<p>Eduardo Rodriguez got the ball in this one, while Johnny Cueto was scratched due to illness in favor of right-hander Davis Martin. The Tigers lefty was really good until the last three batters he faced, somewhat undoing what should have been a stellar outing.</p>\n<p>Rodriguez had really good command for most of the evening. He allowed a one-out double to Yoan Moncada in the first, and a leadoff single to Andrew Vaughn in the second, but from that point on retired 16 in a row, issuing no walks and striking out seven through six scoreless innings.</p>\n<p>However, Martin held his own. The Tigers didn’t get a man past first base until Akil Baddoo tripled down the right field line with two outs in the third. Riley Greene’s ground ball to first stranded Baddoo, and it would be a while until anyone crossed the plate.</p>\n<p>Rodriguez worked his fastball with precision to both sides of the plate, mixing some cutters in on right-hander’s hands, and getting whiffs and weak contact with changeups down and away. </p>\n<p>Finally, after struggling with Martin all game, Tucker Barnhart broke the spell with a double to center field to lead off the bottom of the sixth. Akil Baddoo lined out to Elvis Andrus at short, and White Sox second baseman Romy Gonzalez made a slick barehanded pick and throw to get Riley Greene on a chopper after a review overturned the initial safe call. It was last night’s hero, Victor Reyes who came through with a single to right field to plate Barnhart and give the Tigers the first lead of the night. Harold Castro then reached on an error by Gonzalez at second, but Spencer Torkelson popped out on the first pitch to end the inning.</p>\n\n\n<p>After getting the walk-off sacrifice fly Friday night, Victor Reyes comes through again, this time with a two-out RBI single to give the #Tigers a 1-0 lead. #DetroitRoots pic.twitter.com/tfixqGePoc</p>— Bally Sports Detroit (@BallySportsDET) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The wheels finally came off Rodriguez’s outing in the top of the sixth. Jose Abreu smashed a grounder to shortstop and Ryan Kreidler picked it on a short hop, dropped it momentarily, but stayed with it to get the out. Rodriguez got ahead of Eloy Jimenez 0-2, but then hit him in the backside with a cutter, and suddenly the command went haywire. Andrew Vaughn and Yasmani Grandal walked back-to-back and AJ Hinch went to Jason Foley with the bases loaded. Foley got a ground ball from AJ Pollock, but it was well placed into center field for a two-run single. Foley struck out Luis Robert, and Gonzalez lined out to Baddoo in left to end the inning, but now the Tigers faced a one run deficit.</p>\n<p>The Sox went with Joe Kelly, who struggled badly on Friday night, and this time he had no issue putting the Tigers down in order in the bottom of the seventh. Will Vest retired the Sox 1-2-3 in the top of the eighth with some help from Kreidler, who picked another hot shot from Abreu moving behind second base and got him on the 270 degree spin and throw.</p>\n<p>Kendall Graveman came on in the bottom half and got Barnhart on a ground out. However he then walked Baddoo on four pitches. That’s a huge mistake, as Baddoo’s problem is getting on base. Once he’s there, he’s a nightmare for an opponent. Graveman threw over three times in a row trying to hold him at first, and then Sox pitching coach Ethan Katz and the trainer came out to check on Graveman. Satisfied that he was alright, they retreated to the bench. </p>\n<p>Baddoo took the opportunity to steal second easily with Riley Greene at the dish. The Sox were preoccupied holding him at second, with Elvis Andrus creeping in behind him, and that opened a hole on the left side of the infield. Down 0-2, Greene grounded one perfectly into the vacant terrain and while Andrus made a nice play running out onto the grass to snare it, that fact didn’t stop Baddoo from roaring around from third to score without a pause. Probably he should have held at third, but it worked out as Andrus had to get up and quickly fire home and the throw went wide. Greene took advantage and slid into second just ahead of Yasmani Grandal’s throw, and the Tigers had tied it up. Unfortunately, they couldn’t do any more as Reyes flew out to left and Harold Castro struck out.</p>\n\n\n<p>Riley Greene gets the infield single and the speedy Akil Baddoo scores to tie the game, 2-2! #DetroitRoots@Greene21Riley | @AkilBaddoo pic.twitter.com/ztTXSq1H14</p>— Bally Sports Detroit (@BallySportsDET) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Jose Cisnero looked good in the top of the ninth, running his fastball up to 98 mph. He struck out Eloy and Adam Engel, while Kreidler made a really nice diving play to snare a Grandal line drive headed into right center field to end the half inning. The Tigers were now in the walkoff zone, but would have to get it done against Reynaldo Lopez.</p>\n\n\n<p>Flyin' @Ryan_Kreidler!  ‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/f5DpOpLeIF</p>— Detroit Tigers (@tigers) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>They did not get it done against Reynaldo Lopez. Torkelson flew out. Carpenter watched three high 90’s heaters in a row to strike out, and Schoop popped out to send us to extras for the second straight night.</p>\n<p>Alex Lange took over in the 10th and did a really nice job with some excellent defensive work helping him out. Pollock’s tapper was picked by Barnhart, who tried to backpick Leury Garcia, who started the inning at second. Garcia took off for third and Schoop caught the throw and fired to Harold at third to cut him down. Pollock made it to second on the play. Luis Robert grounded out to third, and Harold held Pollock at second before firing to first. Lange carved up Gavin Sheets with some truly nasty changeups and was FIRED UP about it as he came off the field. </p>\n\n\n<p>Hide your brick walls. pic.twitter.com/4P5aTFGZ9b</p>— Detroit Tigers (@tigers) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Schoop was replaced by Willi Castro as a pinch runner starting the inning on second. However, they were now facing one of the best relievers in the game in closer Liam Hendriks. Kreidler moved Castro to third with a sac bunt. However, Barnhart’s fly ball to center was too shallow to tag and score on, and Baddoo couldn’t catch up to Hendriks’ gas, taking a called strike three to send it to the 11th.</p>\n<p>Gregory Soto came on for the Tigers, with catcher Seby Zavala on second for the White Sox. Andrus dropped down a bunt single to move Zavala to third, and Moncada slapped a grounder into left to score him. </p>\n<p>Soto struck out Abreu for the first out of the inning, but the White Sox pulled off a double steal and a fly ball from Eloy Jimenez brought Andrus home. Engel flew out to end the inning but the Tigers now needed two to tie against lefty Aaron Bummer, with Baddoo starting the inning at second base.</p>\n<p>Riley Greene grounded out, moving Baddoo to third with one out, but Victor Reyes struck out swinging at a Bummer slider. Hinch put in Javier Báez to pinch hit, and the shortstop got it done, lining a fastball away down the first base line. Unfortunately, it bounced into the wall where it juts out, and with an ailing knee Báez had to put on the brakes. Kody Clemens came on to pinch run, and that left it up to Spencer Torkelson. The first baseman hit a rocket on a line to Robert in center field, and that was that.</p>\n\n\n<p>Javier Báez was scratched from the lineup with knee soreness but comes through with the pinch-hit RBI single in the 11th! #DetroitRoots@javy23baez | @AkilBaddoo pic.twitter.com/OEb7hObBwB</p>— Bally Sports Detroit (@BallySportsDET) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The rubber match will start at 12:05 p.m. EDT on Sunday with Drew Hutchison going for the Tigers. The White Sox haven’t announced a starter, but if Cueto is feeling better, that would be my guess.</p>\nErie SeaWolves update\n<p>After losing on Friday night to Richmond to fall a game behind the Bowie Baysox, the SeaWolves got an absolutely dominant outing from Wilmer Flores to win 5-1 and re-tie the division race with one game left in the season. Flores one-hit Richmond over six innings with two walks and eight strikeouts. A fifth inning Andrew Navigato home run was the difference in this one.</p>",

Time for more Davis Martin! He should be pretty well known at Charlotte Douglas International Airport at this point.</p>\n\n\n<p>Prior to tonight’s game at Detroit, the #WhiteSox placed right-handed pitcher Michael Kopech on the 15-day injured list with right shoulder inflammation and recalled right-hander Davis Martin from Class AAA Charlotte.</p>— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Anyways, here’s today’s lineup, look at the replies at your own risk. </p>\n\n\n<p>Tonight's #WhiteSox starters in Detroit.<br /><br />⏰: 5:10 p.m. CT<br /> : @NBCSChicago <br /> : @ESPN1000 <br /> : @FDSportsbook <br /> : O/U 4.5 CWS Total Runs pic.twitter.com/DybLR9BfkW</p>— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Same Jacki. Same.</p>\n\n\n<p>Time to go hatewatch this dumbass team that I can’t stop loving.</p>— jacki likes football now (@zombie_jacki) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Yoán Moncada sends a double into right field and his hot stretch continues.</p>\n\n\n<p>Yoan Moncada has looked good swinging right-handed recently.</p>— Josh Nelson (@soxmachine_josh) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>In good news, we have Chrystal and Elizabeth in Detroit representing South Side Sox.</p>\n\n\n<p>oh, her? pic.twitter.com/TbSGhWfIgr</p>— Chrystal O’Keefe (@chrystal_ok) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>We also have Trooper’s cat here as a support animal for this roller coaster of a season.</p>\n\n\n<p>Catbearpig waiting for the White Sox to show up in the division race. pic.twitter.com/yNvCs8Btth</p>— Trooper Galactus (@TrooperGalactus) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the Twins fail to help the White Sox as they lose to the Guardians. Again. </p>\n\n\n<p>never seen less dawg in a team my god</p>— SoxOptimist (@OptimistSox) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Comfort food helps make the team more tolerable. </p>\n\n\n<p>How do I keep watching the 2022 White Sox, you ask?<br /><br />I got that dog in me. pic.twitter.com/NtyZvD91YI</p>— White Sox Twitt3r VII: Remake (@SoxTwitt3r) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Love seeing the hottest hitter on the team bunting.

Needed a replay for it to be an out — but it is an out.</p>\n\n\n<p>It is overturned. Phenomenal play by Romy Gonzalez</p>— Scott Merkin (@scottmerkin) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>But the Tigers put up the first run of the game. </p>\n\n\n<p>Damn it.</p>— Josh Nelson (@soxmachine_josh) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>And now there’s a defensive miscue by Romy. Thankfully José Abreu can catch, and the Sox don’t suffer.</p>\n\n\n<p>Can the White Sox maybe catch the ball?</p>— Chrystal O’Keefe (@chrystal_ok) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Followed by a not so good one https://t.co/JhKJ13XZNY</p>— Ali White (@aliwhitesox) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>This team has brought us to hoping the Bears can beat the Packers on Sunday Night Football.</p>\n\n\n<p>Folks, you know what time it is:<br /><br />Bear down<br /><br />Also, it's Gunner hours.</p>— Cheap Seats Pod (@cheapbbpodcast) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>And after three walks, the White Sox have loaded the bases with one out and Eduardo Rodríguez is out. Jason Foley is in.</p>\n\n\n<p>Talk about things changing quickly: Rodriguez had retired 16 straight before hitting Jimenez. Now Jason Foley faces Pollock with the bases loaded</p>— Scott Merkin (@scottmerkin) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>And the White Sox take the lead on an AJ Pollock single.</p>\n\n\n<p>FINALLY</p>— Trooper Galactus (@TrooperGalactus) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There we go!  AJ Pollock with a 2-run single.  White Sox take the lead 2-1.</p>— Chuck Garfien (@ChuckGarfien) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>POLLOCK DOING SOMETHING USEFUL CHALLENGE COMPLETE!</p>— Cairo’s boys don’t quit (@NorthSideSoxPod) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>After that excitement, Martin is out, Joe Kelly is in. Also welcome Adam Engel to the game as a replacement.</p>\n\n\n<p>Davis Martin on short notice: 6 IP, 3 H, ER, BB, 5 K, 0 HR, 57 of 85 pitches for strikes, with seven swinging strikes.<br /><br />He has a 3.78 ERA in the first 50 big league innings of his career.<br /><br />Joe Kelly in, Adam Engel in for Andrew Vaughn on defense</p>— James Fegan (@JRFegan) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s three up, three down for Kelly.</p>\n\n\n<p>That might have been the best Joe Kelly has looked this season.</p>— Josh Nelson (@soxmachine_josh) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>And Graveman may or may not be hurt. That’s the 2022 White Sox for you.</p>\n\n\n<p>Trainer, Cairo, Katz out to see what's up with Kendall Graveman.<br /><br />They talk, turn around and go back to dugout.<br /><br />Tigers have tying run on first with one out in the eighth.</p>— Daryl Van Schouwen (@CST_soxvan) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>And thanks to horrible defense, this game is tied. My and others’ thoughts:</p>\n\n\n<p>WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT DEFENSE?????</p>— Dante (@DontizzleJones) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>HOW DOES HE SCORE FROM A GROUND BALL TO SHORT</p>— Liddle Tina (@liddle_ktina) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile in Cleveland it’s 4-0 in the 5th...</p>\n\n\n<p>The Minnesota Twins are an inept baseball team. They’re just getting steamrolled by the Guardians when it counts. They win an awful division sometimes, only to get boat raced in the playoffs, usually by the Yankees. They are a waste of everyone’s time. Cancel the franchise.</p>— Patrick Nolan (@SoxMach_pnoles) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Reynaldo López being great out of the bullpen, we go to extras for the second straight night.</p>\n\n\n<p>The rebirth of Reynaldo Lopez has been one of the few bright spots of 2022 for me.</p>— Trooper Galactus (@TrooperGalactus) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>FREE BASEBALL</p>— WST Mom (@WhiteSoxJoy) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Oh we really gonna lose the same game two nights in a row.</p>— Cairo’s boys don’t quit (@NorthSideSoxPod) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The collective baseball IQ has to be the lowest in baseball. They consistently beat themselves (and Reese isn’t with the team anymore)</p>— Herb Lawrence (@Ecnerwal23) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>And Hendriks comes in for the 10th inning like last night, and this time the game is still tied at the end of it. To the 11th!</p>\n\n\n<p>Hendriks pitches out of it, as Baddoo looks at strike 3.</p>— Scott Merkin (@scottmerkin) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We love a happy Liam scream</p>— whitest sox u'know (@god_of_Flannel) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>White Sox water torture via extra innings.</p>— White Sox Twitt3r VII: Remake (@SoxTwitt3r) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Gregory Soto is in and promptly allows two hits — and the second one, from Moncada, takes the lead. </p>\n\n\n<p>Clutchcada</p>— Ali White (@aliwhitesox) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Live look in to me in front of our living room tv pic.twitter.com/KM0o4cCjsD</p>— jacki likes football now (@zombie_jacki) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>And there’s that insurance run that everyone was praying for via an Eloy Jiménez sacrifice fly. Also, there was a double steal.</p>\n\n\n<p>That's how you manufacture two runs-- bunt, single, double steal, sacrifice fly. 4-2 White Sox in the 11th</p>— Scott Merkin (@scottmerkin) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>That was Moncada's first stolen base this season</p>— Scott Merkin (@scottmerkin) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Out for the save is Aaron Bummer. </p>\n\n\n<p>Aaron Bummer will seek his second save of the year. His first came in this ballpark.</p>— James Fegan (@JRFegan) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>And Javier Báez comes in as a pinch-hitter and singles to make it 4-3 with two outs in the 11th. </p>\n\n\n<p>Baez singles to right to score a run. 4-3 White Sox, and Torkelson is the game-winning run.</p>— Scott Merkin (@scottmerkin) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>But it means nothing, as Spencer Torkelson hits one right at Luis Robert, and this ball game is OVAH. </p>\n\n\n<p>I love how mad Spencer Torkelson gets</p>— Cairo’s boys don’t quit (@NorthSideSoxPod) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Ayyyyyye pic.twitter.com/A9oLMpedtN</p>— jacki likes football now (@zombie_jacki) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>White Sox win, 4-3, and we get to wake up to White Sox baseball tomorrow with an 11 a.m. CT start for the rubber match. </p>",

The Astros took the lead right back from them with three home runs in the bottom of the inning to make it 4-1. Aledmys Diaz (12), Kyle Tucker (28), and Trey Mancini (18) all went deep for a three-run Houston lead. </p>\n\n\n<p>Stay hot. pic.twitter.com/W3ztFFWYPE</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Back. pic.twitter.com/CjgvwbMaC5</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To back. pic.twitter.com/6LTZ4KpVUB</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Oakland spent the rest of the game chipping away at Houston’s pitching. Vimael Machin notched a third-inning sacrifice fly, Chad Pinder smacked a fourth-inning solo homer to right, and Seth Brown hit a three-run shot in the fifth with the eventual game-winner for a 6-4 Oakland lead. </p>\n<p>Brown added an RBI-double in the seventh before Yordan Alvarez (37) hit a solo home run in the eighth to cut into the Oakland lead.

He gave up six runs on seven hits and a pair of walks, striking out six and getting 64-of-93 over the plate. He’s now 13-7 with a 3.96 ERA. \nAlex Bregman, Christian Vázquez, and Mancini notched multiple hits in the loss. \nAfter topping out at a mid-season high of 1.110, Alvarez’ OPS has been steadily dropping ever since. That is, at least until the past few games. From a season-low .974 on September 7, he’s back up to a mark of 1.035. \nJose Altuve and David Hensley were the only Houston players to go hitless in the contest. \nHector Neris pitched a perfect eighth, and collected one strikeout. \n\n<p>Even with the loss, the Astros magic number sits at three for a division title and nine for HFA. As it stands, they’re already the only American League team with a postseason clinch. </p>",

Nola only allowed a d’Arnaud double through the first two innings, but the newly reunited dynamic duo of Ozzie Albies and Ronald Acuna got to him in the third, as Ozzie drew a rare walk and Ronald blasted a monstrous opposite field homer  to give the Braves a 2-0 lead. </p>\n\n\n<p>.@ronaldacunajr24 with a BLAST!#ForTheA pic.twitter.com/SG0esSZNWR</p>— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The Phillies threatened with one out in the fourth, with a single from Alec Bohm and an error from Matt Olson on a Bryce Harper grounder that allowed runners on second and third. JT Realmuto hit a moderately deep fly ball to Michael Harris, whose reputation for having a cannon arm held Bohm, before Odorizzi got another flyout to end the inning unscathed. </p>\n<p>William Contreras led off the bottom fourth with a scalded line drive single before Ozzie poked a ball four inches below the plate to the left side of the infield, beating the shift. Eddie flew out for the first out, but some really nice baserunning from Albies and Contreras put them on second and third for Ronnie. Ozzie showed some discomfort in what looked like his right pinky finger but stayed in the game as a baserunner. Given the same situation that Philly failed to score from, Ronald made no mistake and pulled a double down the third base line for another two RBIs. Ozzie left the game after the half-inning, replaced by Vaughn Grissom, with what was later reported to be a fractured right pinky.</p>\n\n\n<p>2B Ozzie Albies left tonight’s game with a right pinky finger fracture.</p>— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>A walk and a soft single sparked danger in the top fifth, resulting in runners on the corners with one out. A sac fly ended Odorizzi’s evening, as Dylan Lee entered the game in relief, although Ronald Acuna made it a close play at the plate. Kyle Schwarber blooped in a single with two outs to create another situation of runners on the corners, this time with two outs and for Alec Bohm. Lee walked Bohm, loading the bases for Bryce Harper, which is exactly what you do NOT want to do against this Philly team. Bryce Harper pulled a line drive to right field, but Ronald Acuna made a spectacular diving grab to save at least two runs. </p>\n\n\n<p>.@ronaldacunajr24 is doing a little bit of everything tonight! pic.twitter.com/gqpgNWBuKR</p>— MLB (@MLB) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>After three popouts from Atlanta hitters in the fifth, Collin McHugh came in for the sixth and worked an easy 1-2-3 inning. After another toothless inning from the Braves offense, McHugh wasn’t as good in the seventh, as he allowed a single and a double to score a run, exiting the game with one out and a man on second. AJ Minter was the reliever of choice for the situation, and he escaped the inning with two pitches, from a flyout and a groundout. Nola had a dominant seventh and final inning, striking out Acuna, Swanson, and Riley. </p>\n<p>Minter got the eighth, as one would expect, especially with Harper as the leadoff batter. After a good battle, Harper hit a .470 xBA double to right center, and that was the end of Minter’s night as Raisel Iglesias entered the game. After a hard-hit flyout from Realmuto, a Brandon Marsh single failed to score Harper, due to the fear of Ronald Acuna’s arm from right field. A Bryson Stott single does score Harper, however, cutting Atlanta’s lead to one run. A popout mercifully ended the inning. Brad Hand entered in relief for Nola and Matt Olson crushed a fly ball to deep center to lead off the eight that just fell short of the wall for an out, but a was good sign for Olson, who has been struggling. Travis d’Arnaud reached on a hard hit single before Harris struck out. William Contreras grounded out to end the inning, sending the game to the top of the ninth with a one run lead for Kenley Jansen, who has struggled recently. Kenley had a nice clear 1-2-3 inning, assisted by a great hustle play by Dansby Swanson to catch a pop fly right up against the foul netting. </p>\n<p>Join us tomorrow as the Braves try to sweep the Phillies at 1:35 PM ET. </p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "Michael McLoone-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Just a boring, lifeless effort in Milwaukee</p> <p>This is another one of those games that’s hard to write about. The Yankees didn’t just play badly, they played boringly. If this was some titanic, 10-8 back-and-forth affair, or if someone forgot how many outs there were and tossed the ball into the stands allowing a run to come across, that’s at least interesting and something worth talking about. There’s really no greater sin in my eyes than being boring, fail spectacularly if you must fail, don’t bore me.</p>\n<p>Instead, the starter tonight was bad but not horrifically so, the lineup was wholly uninterested in doing anything, and Aaron Judge had one of the few nights this season where he wasn’t the star of the show, and it all added up to a 5-1 Yankees loss.</p>\n<p>After Frankie Montas burst into flames last night, there was some fair conversation around whether you’d rather have him, or tonight’s starter Jameson Taillon, on the hill in a playoff game. We’ll need to wait and see about Montas’ health, but Taillon did himself no favors in his outing tonight.</p>\n<p>He wasn’t as bad as he could possibly be, but he threw way too many pitches and struggled with any kind of putaway pitch. He got just seven whiffs all night, only one on his four-seam fastball, as every single plate appearance seemed to take 5-6 pitches, and seemingly every Brewer getting one pitch to drive.</p>\n<p>Not all of them did, and indeed, the real difference in the game was a single mistake to Willy Adames:</p>\n\n<p>Christian Yelich added an RBI double to give Taillon his four earned runs against, but the four strikeouts against the two walks was the real problem. Taillon can’t have both — he’s sacrificed some swing and miss in order to avoid walks, but if he walks guys AND allows barrels, that approach falls apart really quickly. Montas was worse yesterday, but Taillon had a chance to move up in the pecking order tonight and couldn’t do it.</p>\n<p>Marwin González left the game in the third after a rather bizarre injury:</p>\n\n\n<p>Marwin Gonzalez has exited tonight's #MLBNShowcase following this play. pic.twitter.com/Qh7aQj9StU</p>— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Marwin went down immediately and was evaluated for some time. After leaving last night’s game with dizziness, you hope there wasn’t some kind of serious head injury, but taking a ball off the unprotected side of your head is definitely a scary thing.</p>\n<p>Brandon Woodruff is a very good pitcher, but he is not so good that you can’t pull the trigger on 97 center-cut. Giancarlo Stanton, and indeed, the rest of the lineup, disagreed, with Stanton in particular having a terrible night, with the golden sombrero. Gleyber Torres had a double in the first inning, Judge had a double of his own, and Josh Donaldson homered for the second straight game.</p>\n<p>After that, there was almost nothing done at the plate, as Woodruff carved through the order with 10 Ks against a single walk. The Yankees didn’t even have an inning with multiple runners on base at the same time, and bounced into a pair of double plays and nearly a third. Awful, listless performance.</p>\n<p>Gerrit Cole is going to be called upon to be the stopper tomorrow. The Yankees need to find a way to salvage a game in this series, but the big trouble with Cole this season has been the long ball, and only two teams in baseball hit more home runs than Milwaukee. The final game of this series kicks off at 2:10pm Eastern tomorrow, and hopefully is far less boring.</p>\n<p>Box Score</p>",

        "description": "FanGraphs\n    \n\n  <p>In a game of almost-deja vu, Davis Martin leads the South Siders to an extra-inning W</p> <p>With yesterday’s extra-inning loss against the Tigers, today was pretty much do-or-die after the Guardians picked up the first game against the Twins in their doubleheader. This game felt like deja vu, but this time the Good Guys game out alive, winning the game, 4-3, in 11 innings.</p>\n\nThe Starters\n<p>Michael Kopech went on the IL today, and Johnny Cueto was feeling sick, so tonight we turned to Davis Martin, who would have been taking Kopech’s turn tomorrow. The White Sox spot-starter extraordinaire sure did deliver! Over six innings, he relied on his fastball the majority of the time, though his curveball was quite active and had a 35% CSW (called strike plus whiff rate). He gave up just three hits while fanning five and walking one. </p>\n<p>Martin’s 85-pitch outing looked like this:</p>\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \n<p>On the other half of the rubber, Eduardo Rodríguez had his own success against a dumbfounded White Sox lineup. The offense was struggling hard against Rodríguez, who fooled the South Siders continuously on his sinker and changeup, which he threw the majority of the time. He ultimately struck out seven Sox hitters, while giving up two runs on his 87 pitches.</p>\n<p>Rodríguez’s outing looked like this:</p>\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \n\nPressure Play\n<p>Eduardo Rodríguez worked himself into a jam in the top of the seventh, leaving Jason Foley to come in and attempt to clean up his mess. AJ Pollock singled to center to score Eloy Jiménez and Yasmani Grandal to take the lead, 2-1. The LI on the play was 5.07.</p>\n\nPressure Cooker\n<p>Liam Hendriks faced the most pressure in back-to-back nights, topping yesterday’s pLI with a 4.02. Things got dicey in the bottom of the 10th after a pair of fly balls, but the second didn’t have the distance, and Liam got himself out of the inning unscathed this time.</p>\n\nTop Play\n<p>Elvis Andrus made a fantastic stop on a ground ball to Riley Greene in the bottom of the eighth; however, he seemed to be stunned that Akil Baddoo was actually running from second to home on an infield single, and made an off-mark throw home that allowed the Tigers to tie the game. The WPA was .302. Between Baddoo and Andrus, you can decide who the bigger airhead was on this play.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Performer\n<p>Liam Hendriks and Alex Lange were the top performers today, at .304 WPA. Lange got out of a super-tough spot in the 10th, striking Gavin Sheets out to get out of the inning. Liam technically faced the most pressure and successfully got out of it, though, and his team won the game, so Hendriks is the winner in my book. ;) </p>\n\n\n\n\n\nSmackdown\n<p>Hardest Hit: José Abreu had the hardest hit back-to-back nights, this time on a ground out in the seventh that left the bat at 111.3 mph.</p>\n\n<p>Weakest Contact: Elvis Andrus’ bunt in the third was the softest contact today, leaving the bat at just 41.6 mph. He also had the third-weakest contact on a base hit in the 11th at just 45.9 mph. Sometimes, it works!</p>\n\n<p>Luckiest Hit: Yoán Moncada’s go-ahead single in the 11th had an xBA of .210.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Toughest Out: Once again, that would be Yoán Moncada, who was robbed by Akil Baddoo in the sixth. This ball had an xBA of .900. And it was his dinky grounder that was a hit and an RBI (above) — go figure.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><br />Longest Hit: Jonathan Schoop’s fly out in the second traveled 369 fit. Nice.</p>\n\n\nMagic Number: 4\n\n<p>The White Sox are still four games behind the Guardians (pending the outcome of the Cleveland-Minnesota nightcap), but do just enough to keep the AL Central lead within reach, stringing us all along. </p>\n\nGlossary\n<p>Hard-hit is any ball off the bat at 95 mph or more<br />LI measures pressure per play<br />pLI measures total pressure faced in-game<br />Whiff a swing-and-miss<br />WPA win probability added measures contributions to the win<br />xBA expected batting average</p>",

Kenley Jansen tossed a perfect ninth to end the game.

        "description": "Chase Solesky made the most of his final appearance of 2022, whiffing six batter in three innings for Birmingham. | Tiffany Wintz/South Side Sox\n    \n\n  <p>Charlotte rallies for a win that brings it back to just 30 under .500, while Birmingham forgets to pack the bats</p>   \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n<p>Charlotte makes a valiant comeback to win and pull to just 30 games under .500, as the Knights pen Locked It Down for five innings (except Kade McClure, who ironically was awarded the win). After the Tides had turned a tie game into a 4-3 lead after the seventh-inning stretch, Charlotte craftily drew no-out walks to load the bases, and was almost thwarted by a textbook 5-2-3 Carlos Pérez GIDP! But the eventual GWRBI came with two outs and off of the bat of Yolbert Sánchez, who singled his way to two runs, and glory:</p>\n\n\n<p>THE LEAD is OURS! <br /><br />Yolbert Sánchez with a two-run single in the 8th! pic.twitter.com/3DTGcRRc57</p>— Charlotte Knights (@KnightsBaseball) September 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p> Charlotte was 4-for-15 with RISP and left 14 on, so the buzz wears off of the giddiness right quick. But hey, 55-85, let’s just all go out and party.</p>\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n<p>The very nature of Project Birmingham is that the Barons will not play out the string, even on the second-to-last game of the season, right? Well, zero runs and two hits might lobby otherwise. Luis Mieses and Wilfred Veras, the two players who have proved most worthy of this premature call-up to Double-A, had hits. Also, 14 Ks, zero BBs. Woo-hoo?</p>\n<p>But on the pitching side, Birmingham was aces. Drew Dalquist, star-crossed yet this season, ended on a terrific note, throwing 60 pitches over four innings of one-(unearned) run, one-hit ball, with six strikeouts. </p>\n<p>(Now, for the bad news: That unearned run, well, it was Drew’s fault, as he hit the leadoff man in the fourth, missed on a pickoff throw that pushed him to second, induced a grounder that sent him to third, and then saw the game-deciding run score on a sac fly. Sigh.)</p>\n<p>Chase Solesky saw the gauntlet Dalquist threw down and topped it, with no runs on two hits with six Ks over just three innings. And Fraser Ellard, well, he was running out of game in which to match his teammates, but hey, two Ks in one inning, that’ll do.</p>",

        "description": "Inside the $100 Billion Mission to Modernize America's Aging Nuclear Missiles. \"Walking into Moffett's capsule at Alpha-01 is like walking into the past. Banks of turquoise electronics racks, industrial cables, and analog controls have been down here since the U.S. military installed the equipment decades ago. Look closely at the machines and you'll find names of manufacturers like Radio Corp. of America, defunct since 1987, and Hughes Aircraft Co., defunct since 1997. Some systems have been updated over the years, but these advances are unrecognizable to anyone who lived through the personal-computer revolution, let alone the internet age. The entire ICBM fleet runs on less computational power than what's now found inside the smartphone in your pocket. When something breaks, the Air Force maintenance crews pull parts from warehouse shelves, pay a contractor to make them to specifications, or even occasionally scavenge them from military museums.\"",
