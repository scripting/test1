        "description": "Stephen Brashear-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Max Fried allowed two homers and the Braves weren’t the team to snap George Kirby’s streak of incredibly awesome pitching as they fell out of the NL East lead with a loss that snapped their winning streak.</p> <p>Sometimes, you’re the team that hits a bunch of homers in a win. Sometimes, you’re the team whose fly balls don’t do much of anything while you get outhomered 2-0, and lose a close game to drop out of the NL East lead... for the moment. Sometimes, that last thing even happens when you’re riding an eight-game winning streak. It happens!</p>\n<p>This game started out as a pretty cool duel between the extremely-effective pitching of Max Fried and George Kirby. Through four innings, both hurlers allowed just a couple of singles — Fried’s both came in the first but led to no damage, while Kirby erased one on a double play in the first, and stranded the other on second after a stolen base. After Kirby’s 1-2-3 fifth, however, the Mariners struck first when Sam Haggerty guessed very right on a first-pitch slider (?) and smashed it into left field for a long home run. In the sixth, it was kind of a repeat: the Braves again went 1-2-3 against Kirby, and with two outs, Eugenio Suarez destroyed a first-pitch sinker (again, question mark) to make it 2-0. Fried finished his six frames with a 6/0 K/BB ratio (he did graze a batter at one point, apparently), but those two longballs were the difference in the game.</p>\n<p>Kirby started the seventh, where he encountered some trouble that wasn’t his fault. Dansby Swanson led off the frame with a single, and Austin Riley followed with a bouncer to short that should have been an easy double play ball. But, for whatever reason, J.P. Crawford goofed and had the ball bounce past him, putting the tying runs on the corners with none out. That was it for Kirby, whose air ride completely flummoxed the Braves: he had six weakly-hit air balls against him to go with a 6/0 K/BB ratio of his own, continuing his streak of homerless, one-walk-or-fewer starts, which is now at 11. </p>\n<p>The Mariners got out of the jam by deploying firethrower Andres Munoz. Matt Olson greeted Munoz with a weak grounder to second that scored Swanson but forced Riley at second. Olson advanced a base on a weird tapper by Travis d’Arnaud that was ruled a groundout at first because d’Arnaud got in the way of a potential throw. The Braves couldn’t tie the game, though, as Munoz eviscerated Michael Harris II with four straight sliders low or below the zone. Harris took the first for a ball, and then had three wacky, “I have no idea what’s going on” swings at the next three to end the frame and the Braves’ chances in this one.</p>\n<p>Since the score was not in Atlanta’s favor despite the one-run deficit, it was apparently time for the rear end of the bullpen contingent, so Jesse Chavez came in and ended up extending said deficit. Chavez got two quick outs, but somehow walked pinch-hitter Adam Frazier, and then gave up a crushed low-liner double to Julio Rodriguez that scored Frazier from first. </p>\n<p>In the eighth, the Mariners deployed their other now-super-awesome relief arm, Erik Swanson, who retired the side on nine pitches, including two more easy flyouts. Kirby Yates, not to be confused with the other Kirby in this game, worked around a leadoff walk in the bottom of the eighth to keep it a 3-1 game.</p>\n<p>The Braves had the top of their order up against Paul Sewald in the ninth, but didn’t do anything. A nubber and then back-to-back four-pitch strikeouts ended the game, dropping the Braves half a game out of first place in the NL East.</p>\n<p>This game was played under a pallor of haze from wildfires in the area, and while that might seem appropriate set dressing for the weak offensive effort from Atlanta’s bats in this game, keep in mind that short of Jacob deGrom-directly-to-Edwin Diaz, this game featured probably one of the toughest pitching slates the Braves could face all year. George Kirby, Andres Munoz, Erik Swanson, and Paul Sewald are a pitching force, and the Braves should have an easier path tomorrow against the decidedly not-forceful Marco Gonzales.</p>",

Moving on.</p>\n<p>Madison Bumgarner’s pitching line tonight: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6 IP, 6 H, 3 BB, 1 K, 1 WP, 4 ER</p>\n<p>Madison Bumgarner’s earnings for his outing tonight, calculated by innings pitched:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$937,500</p>\n<p>Weirdly, perhaps, Bum was actually quite good through his first five innings of work. He put up zeros through those innings, surrendering only two hits and a walk and facing only three batters more than the minimum. I had been bracing myself for more of the usual suckage, but it wasn’t happening. That was nice. While it lasted.</p>\n<p>He faced off against Rockies’ righthander Jose Ureña, who entered the game with an ERA just above 6.00, so it wasn’t unreasonable to think that we might be able to tee off against Ureña. Sadly, we didn’t.</p>\n<p>Jake McCarthy, who continues to cement his position as my absolute favorite new position player for the Diamondbacks, drew a leadoff walk with two outs in the top of the first. Nothing came of it, though, and he was the only one of the good guys who reached base until the top of the fourth, when he became the second of the good guys to reach base, and the first to notch a hit.</p>\n<p>With one out, Jake stroked a grounder into right for a single. Christian Walker singled to left to advance him to second. Ketel Marte, once again DH-ing, I suspect because that’s the position where he can do the least harm to the team, succeeded in not ending the inning by grounding into a double play, and in fact hit a ground ball to right for a single that allowed McCarthy to score from second. </p>\n\n\n<p>Ketel Marte gets the offense rolling with an RBI single! pic.twitter.com/iaraDoRCoE</p>— Bally Sports Arizona (@BALLYSPORTSAZ) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Emmanuel Rivera came to the plate then, and perhaps feeling like Marte had dropped the ball with his customary inning ending duties, picked him up by grounding into a 5-4-3 double play to shut that silliness down. Still, we had a lead. 1-0 D-BACKS</p>\n<p>[And yes, that is your sole video highlight of the game. Sorry. It is what it is.]</p>\n<p>That little eruption of potential offense contained, we settled down and went in order in the top of the 5th, while Bumgarner continued to cruise. Then the top of the sixth rolled around.</p>\n<p>Bumgarner was actually in good shape going into the sixth. He’d thrown only 69 pitches, put up five zeros, and while there had been an awful lot of fly-ball outs (8 of 15 at that point), they had all stayed in the yard. The longest AB anyone had hung on him up to that point was 6 pitches. </p>\n<p>On the third pitch of his sixth inning, though, Randall Grichuk, Colorado’s right fielder, doubled off the wall in the left-center gap to lead things off. Had the launch angle been just a bit different, it would have been in the seats. Bum then walked Yonathan Daza, the Rockies’ CF, on seven pitches, and promptly unleashed a wild pitch that allowed both runners to advance, taking the double play possibilities off the table. Didn’t matter anyway, though, as CJ Cron, inspiration for countless “Wrath of Khan” memes, inspired yet another of those memes by launching a no-doubt dinger over the center field wall. A single and a double later, Bum finally recorded the first out of the inning. He then walked another batter, loading the bases, before getting out of it finally on a sacrifice to center that brought in another run and an infield popout to get us off the field. 4-1 Colorado</p>\n<p>And yeah, that was pretty much it. We were already into the Rockies’ bullpen by that point, but we did nothing against them, managing only a leadoff walk in the eighth by Cooper Hummel. Meanwhile, Taylor Widener got into and then pitched out of trouble in the seventh, and then Mark Melancon did pretty much the same thing in the eighth. They both put up zeros, but so did we, and that’s your ballgame. </p>\nWin Probability Added, courtesy of Fangraphs\n\n  \n        \n  \n<p>Arnold Palmer: Nobody, sadly, as nobody managed better than a +7.6% WPA tonight.Phil Mickelson: Emmanuel Rivera (0 for 3, -13.2 % WPA), The Bum Himself (pitching line above, -11.6% WPA)</p>\n<p>We had a pretty well-attended Gameday Thread tonight, with 203 comments at time of writing. Not too shabby, especially given how lackluster this game wound up being in terms of excitement. Comment of the Game goes, without question, to redsedona, who made this bold and frankly implausible prediction early on, only to see it come true:</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>Stop by tomorrow to see if we can maybe avoid the indignity of getting swept by the Colorado Cellar-Dwellers. If you don’t care about that, still, you should stop by, because Zac Gallen is taking the mound with only one more scoreless inning needed to become the new Diamondbacks team record holder for most consecutive scoreless innings pitched. If he has another outing like his last several, and goes as deep as he has been going lately, he might even catch up with Don Drysdale and get into the highest levels of the MLB record books. History in the making, people. You don’t want to miss it. </p>\n<p>First pitch is slated for 12:10pm AZ time. Some guy named Ryan Feltner is pitching for the Rockies, if you care. Hope you can join us.</p>\n<p>Anyway. As always, thanks for reading. And as always, go Diamondbacks!</p>",

We were descending the steep face of a mountain dominating one of our largest lakes when we saw 200ft below us on an earthy scree an animal whose reddish brown coat glistened gloriously in the sunshine. The radiance of the fur was the impression which remained long after we dwelt with wonderment upon our great good fortune. Brush, almost as long as the body, was outstretched behind. It was carried as a fox carries his brush when he is hunting. We had seen a stoat some hours previously as we made our way up a ghyll between the mountain sides. This creature was of the stoat tribe. But it was almost twice as large.</p><p>The pine marten, for this was the beast we saw, was leisurely making his way down the mountain. He neither saw nor winded us, and had we known that it was to disappear over a bank, and that we should never set eyes on it again, we should have alarmed it in the hope that the creature would turn round to examine the intruders on his haunts. But we caught a glimpse of the creamy-white breast and of the sharp-pointed triangular head. The pine marten was far away from a coombe which is supposed to be the stronghold of the remaining members of its race. We are encouraged, therefore, to believe that the woodland beast is increasing. No pine martens have been trapped for years in the district.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p>LONDON — As Britain mourns the death of its longest-serving monarch, frantic preparations are already underway in London for what is shaping up to be one of the century’s biggest diplomatic occasions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hundreds of current and former heads of state and government will join scores of other dignitaries descending upon Britain next week for the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, who died Thursday after 70 years on the throne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have already confirmed they will attend the funeral, which Buckingham Palace announced Saturday will be held on September 19, at 11 a.m. at Westminster Abbey. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The historic church, with capacity for 2,000 people, was the setting for Queen Elizabeth’s marriage to Prince Philip in 1947, and for all but two British coronations since 1066.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also likely to attend the funeral are Japan’s Emperor Naruhito — who may travel alongside Empress Masako and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida — Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and French President Emmanuel Macron, among many more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spain is likely to be represented by King Felipe VI, who has blood ties to the British royal family dating back to the 19th century. Members of other European royal families including from Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden will also travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It would not be surprising if all the crowned heads of state from Europe come, as well as heads of state and heads of government in other countries,” said a former Cabinet minister who was in government at the time of another major funeral, that of former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 2013. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It will be a huge diplomatic event,” they added. “Her majesty’s last contribution to the wellbeing of our country is to provide an excuse for a huge diplomatic get-together.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This will be a funeral like no other, or few other,” agreed John Kampfner, director of the “U.K. in the World” initiative at the Chatham House think tank. “There have been great state funerals before — of American presidents, of Nelson Mandela and others. But quite simply the queen was the most famous person in the world, and as a result I think there will be an attendance list that will be unprecedented.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most notable — albeit unsurprising — absence will be that of Russian President Vladimir Putin, after the Kremlin said his attendance is not an option. In gossipy diplomatic circles, just as important as who’s coming is simply who is receiving an invitation, with embassy officials eager to discover whether Chinese President Xi Jinping will be offered the chance to attend.</p>\n\n\n\nWorking around the clock\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, diplomats are fretting over the sheer scale of what is about to unfold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The preparations for the funeral represent a colossal logistical, security and diplomatic task, with tens of thousands of people expected to travel to London over the coming days. Foreign embassies are already handling hundreds of calls from private citizens enquiring whether it would be possible to land in the capital on the same day of the funeral, and rushing to book flights and accommodation.</p>\n\n\n\nThe hearse makes its way past Downing Street during the Ceremonial funeral of former British Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher on April 17, 2013 | Gareth Cattermole – WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\n\n\n<p>“It will be a huge challenge from many perspectives: protocol, security, sensitivities,” said Ioannis Raptakis, Greek ambassador to the U.K., who agreed it will be of a similar magnitude to Nelson Mandela’s state funeral in 2013 or the COP26 U.N. climate change summit in Glasgow last year, in terms of the sheer number of world leaders likely to attend. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Almost every country will make an effort to be represented. But I have full trust in the British protocol experts — they have the experience of organizing COP26 recently, which was like a rehearsal.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others are more concerned. “We are very worried about the logistics,” one diplomat said, pointing to a perceived lack of organization during the G7 summit in Cornwall last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the morning of the funeral itself, the queen’s coffin will be carried in a procession to Westminster Abbey from 900-year-old Westminster Hall, where the public will have had several days to pay their respects. The nation will observe a two-minute silence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the one-hour funeral service, a large ceremonial procession will accompany the coffin to nearby Hyde Park, where it will be transferred from gun carriage to state hearse. The coffin will then travel 20 miles west of central London, to Windsor Castle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following a committal service at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor, the coffin will finally be lowered into the royal vault on the castle grounds, beside that of the queen’s late husband Prince Philip, who died in April 2021.</p>\n\n\n\nMore than just a funeral\n\n\n\n<p>Official protocol dictates that invitations will be offered to the head of state from each country, and their spouse or partner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Major funerals are strange moments for world diplomacy, combining solemn periods of mourning with inevitable opportunities for bilateral and multilateral encounters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last state funeral to be held in the U.K. took place in 1965, following the death of former Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Dignitaries from an unprecedented 112 countries — including the likes of Dwight Eisenhower, Charles de Gaulle and Queen Elizabeth herself — attended the service at St. Paul’s Cathedral, which was followed on TV and radio by an estimated 350 million people around the world. Despite the funeral being held at the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union sent its deputy prime minister to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diplomacy around such events is undoubtedly possible. In 1979, immediately after the funeral of Louis Mountbatten — a relative of the queen who was murdered by the IRA — Thatcher held a summit with her Irish counterpart John Lynch at a time of high tensions between the two countries. The meeting became a “sort of prelude” toward the Good Friday / Belfast peace agreement, according to the former Cabinet minister quoted above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Kampfner said that this time leaders will have to proceed discreetly with any private conversations or encounters, with the protocol for a head of state’s funeral stricter than for any other such service — and especially since Queen Elizabeth was no ordinary figurehead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“All heads of state and others will be very cautious about being seen to be overly engaging in any direct diplomacy on an occasion like that,” said Kampfner.</p>\n\n\n\nSouth Africa President at the time Jacob Zuma gives a speech during the funeral ceremony of South African former president Nelson Mandela | Pool photo by Odd Andersen/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n<p>Leaders will also need to be careful not to accidentally overshadow the late monarch, or steal attention with actions that might be considered disrespectful. Memories are still fresh of the beaming selfie taken by former Danish Premier Helle Thorning-Schmidt with former U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron and ex-U.S. President Barack Obama at the Johannesburg memorial service for Mandela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, what incidental moments there are between leaders will be of keen interest to seasoned observers, Kampfner said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was the case with the famous handshake between Obama and Cuba’s Raul Castro at Mandela’s funeral, a brief moment interpreted as evidence of a warming relationship between Washington and Havana.</p>\n\n\n\nTruss under the spotlight\n\n\n\n<p>For Liz Truss herself, the occasion will offer “polite getting-to-know-you moments” with key leaders which should prove valuable for a prime minister only appointed earlier this month, Kampfer said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he warned that the new U.K. premier “won’t want to be seen engaging in any discussions about the many problems that the world faces, because of the sensitivity of the moment.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certainly, Downing Street is adamant the U.K.’s 10-day mourning period is to be rigorously observed, which means formal meetings between Truss and other international leaders will not be scheduled until politics resumes. For more substantial conversations, Truss will therefore have to wait for the U.N. General Assembly taking place in New York later that week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I would think if a president or a prime minister came up and expressed their real condolences about her majesty and how much she was appreciated, and they talk at that level, they will have a big impact,” said Conservative MP Peter Bone, who attended Thatcher’s funeral. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If they say — ‘we want a free trade agreement,’ that will be totally inappropriate.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article was updated to include new detail of the funeral arrangements and protocol.</p>",

        "description": "Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis promised increases in pensions and the minimum wage as part of a €5.5 billion relief package announced Saturday that aims to cushion the impact of the energy crisis and inflation.\n\n\n\nThe pensions increase would be the first since the country&#8217;s financial crisis erupted more than a decade ago. It would benefit some 1.5 million pensioners.\n\n\n\nThe minimum wage would rise next year, most likely in May 2023, Mitsotakis said.\n\n\n\nGreece&#8217;s has increased the minimum salary twice in 2022 with the monthly gross minimum wage currently at €713 per month, still lower than the level it was before the crisis. The country lags behind most advanced economies in offering well-paid jobs, according to the OECD.\n\n\n\nThe country is facing high inflation, which remained in double-digits for a fifth consecutive month in August at 11.4 percent.\n\n\n\nMitsotakis made the announcement while speaking to an audience of businesspeople and politicians at the annual trade fair in Thessaloniki, Greece’s second-biggest city, after Athens. The ruling New Democracy government faces elections in 2023 and the speech was largely seen as a kick-off for the pre-election period.\n\n\n\n“I know that the months ahead are election months,” Mitsotakis said. “I will therefore make no secret of the fact that our big choices are now clearer than ever: Either we keep moving forward or we turn back.”\n\n\n\nThe €5.5 billion cost-of-living relief package also includes, among other things, a one-off handout of €250 for vulnerable households, a €300 million increase in a heating subsidy for 1.3 million homes, and a €1.8 billion plan to help young people rent or purchase a house.",

        "description": "<p>The musician and writer have turned hours of lockdown phone conversations into a book. Here, Cave talks movingly about how the loss of his son affected his songwriting, and how the kindness of strangers helped </p><p>In the early, anxious weeks of the first Covid lockdown in March 2020, Nick Cave and I spoke regularly on the phone. I have known Nick for more than 30 years, but in that time our paths tended to cross only fleetingly, often backstage at his concerts or when I was asked to interview him. The pandemic changed all that. With time on our hands and the world out of kilter, our phone chats turned into extended conversations about all manner of subjects, both esoteric and everyday. In that strange and heightened moment, the idea for a book was born.</p><p>Faith, Hope and Carnage is the end result of nearly 40 hours of recorded phone conversations that happened, off and on, between August 2020 and the summer of 2021. In the chapter that follows, Nick talks about the predictive, even uncannily prophetic nature of certain songs, the vulnerability that attends songwriting, and his working relationship with his collaborator and friend, Warren Ellis. He speaks candidly about the capsizing nature of grief, but also the small, but transformative, acts of kindness that he experienced from strangers in the wake of the death of his son, Arthur, and the “impossible realm” he entered while making his acclaimed album, Ghosteen. </p> Continue reading...",

In the past, the pair, who are based in Paris, have staged their work in Calgary, Canada, and on the Canary Island of Fuerteventura. Their latest series, The Timeless Story of Moormerland, now on show in Paris, is set in a small German town near the Dutch border. Parra and Benaïnous lived in several villages in and around Moormerland for a month in the spring of last year. They chose houses to stay in that had a kind of vintage charm, or flowery claustrophobia, depending on your point of view. They used these homes as backdrops to bring to life various characters – teenagers, young lovers, fathers, housewives – and narratives from the 1950s onwards.</p><p>This picture, of the pair embracing on a jetty, is typical. The embrace is ambiguous, the staging a little too perfect. The symmetry of the couple in their pastels picking up the upside-down reflections of the waterfront demands that the viewer supply a storyline. The scene is ghostly silent, though its drama is amplified by the picture’s title: The Sound of the Bell Tower. The more you look the more you can hear that bell ring across the water.</p><p>Elsa &amp; Johanna: The Timeless Story of Moormerland is at the MEP, Paris until 6 November</p> Continue reading...",

The state is now a stage, and those who strut and fret on it think of power as a licence for self-indulgence. Rudy Giuliani’s managerial style when he was mayor of New York pointed the way: as Andrew Kirtzman says in his biography, Giuliani replaced prudent governance with “over-the-top drama” and delighted in spectacularly “blowing things up”. Kirtzman’s phrase knowingly anticipates the scenario of 9/11, when al-Qaida operatives toppled the World Trade Center: ill-tempered and incendiary, Giuliani in his small way reigned through terror.</p><p>Chronicling Giuliani’s “rise and tragic fall”, Kirtzman picks apart the “hero narrative” that once exalted a man who these days seems so mentally befogged and physically seedy. His leadership on 9/11 made Giuliani seem “godlike”; one worshipful New Yorker upped the ante by gasping “He is God!”. He came to be known as “America’s mayor”, a stalwart guardian envied by communities everywhere, and during a global victory lap he received an honorary knighthood from the Queen. Off duty, he exchanged glory for glitz: after the investiture at Buckingham Palace, he schmoozed with Simon Cowell and Andrew Lloyd Webber in Richard Branson’s Babylonian roof-garden restaurant.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Colson Montgomery’s first Double-A home run was a grand slam. | Birmingham Barons\n    \n\n  <p>Charlotte rides a seven-run inning to victory, Colson Montgomery finally has a good game in Double-A with a homer, and Kannapolis’ bullpen has a day to forget</p>   \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n<p>Even if it works out, like it did today for Charlotte for a 8-5 win, the way the Knights go about their business is just very annoying. They really only have two or three real starters in their rotation right now, and it is a bullpen game for half of the team’s starts. Today was a bullpen game, and it started out terrible, with Chris Blewett allowing three runs in four outs. Yoan Aybar allowed two more runs in the fourth, and the Knights were down, 5-0, heading into the bottom half of the inning. But there, the offense exploded for seven runs to take the lead, and the pen held it for the rest of the game. They combined for five no-hit innings with Lincoln Henzman starting the effort and going two. Andrew Perez had 1-2-3 ninth for his second save.</p>\n<p>That seven-run fourth was off the back of three homers. Zach Remillard had a solo homer to start the inning. Craig Dedelow hit a three-run homer three batters later.</p>\n\n\n<p>GONE BABY GONE!@Craig_DEEDS goes YARD!!! pic.twitter.com/s3dQLpVuCj</p>— Charlotte Knights (@KnightsBaseball) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Carlos Pèrez had the third and final homer of the inning, his 20th of the season, a two-run shot. He and multiple other hitters had at least two hits on the day. It was kind of an offensive explosion with 15 hits on the day for the Knights.</p>\n\n\n<p>Post-polls side note: Reliever Hunter Schryver, who had a 3.89 ERA in 33 games with the Knights this season, his best at Triple-A in his career, announced his retirement today. He had pitched as recently as September 8, and if it’s his final pro outing, it ended on a bad note: two innings, six hits, five runs/four earned. In the past three years, the southpaw moved up from No. 63, to 48, to 45 on our SSS Top 100, and he would have been in the mix for an injury call-up as soon as this month.</p>\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n<p>All the Barons needed today were the arms, and Colson Montgomery. Birmingham threw a shutout, as Garrett Schoenle started and went the first four innings. Kohl Simas took over and issued the staff’s only walk today, but he still did not get into much trouble. </p>\n<p>Where Colson Montgomery comes in is for four of the five runs scored. He hit a grand slam, plus a single. His slam was the first Double-A homer of his career.</p>\n\n\n<p>Colson Montgomery with a grand slam! 5-0 #Barons. #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/H0kUXWutaW</p>— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Montgomery has really struggled during Project Birmingham, with a .154 batting average and a .427 OPS. He is not walking much and is striking out much more than normal for him. He could move back down to Winston-Salem to start 2023. Oscar Colás has been very good over his Double-A stint, and he had a couple hits today. His double was the second of the two extra-base hits for Birmingham. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Due to inclement weather, the Winston-Salem Dash have postponed today's game. The Dash will play a double header tomorrow starting at 11am. All gates will open at 10am. Tickets for today's game can be redeemed for tomorrow, Sunday 9/11, or any game in April/May of '23. pic.twitter.com/eAdG5E0ikE</p>— Winston-Salem Dash (@WSDashBaseball) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n<p>It was a very rough game for the bullpen, offense, and the defense — well for at least three CBs fielders. Jose Jimenez had the start, and was brilliant over his five innings. He didn’t allow a run, and struck out three. He relied on fly balls to get through his stint, and it worked for him, as he left the game with a 1-0 lead. The bullpen gave it away pretty quickly, though, with Bowen Plagge allowing five runs over two innings and Drew McDaniel allowing four in the eighth to make the loss a blowout. </p>\n<p>The offense did not do much outside of one lone extra-base hit from Victor Torres. It was his seventh homer of the season. </p>\n\n\n<p>Victor Torres goes deep and gives the #Ballers the lead 1-0.  It’s the 5th and the lead still stands.  #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/IUeLaWDxhm</p>— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Brooks Baldwin had a good day, too, with two singles. But nobody drove him in, and there were not many opportunities to drive in runners when he was at the plate.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Toronto film festival: Rian Johnson’s entertaining follow-up brings back Daniel Craig and the same, if less potent, cocktail of twists and mystery</p><p>The hugely deserved enthusiasm that met Rian Johnson’s crafty, infectious 2019 whodunnit Knives Out was of such frenzied intensity that it didn’t just launch a franchise, it helped relaunch a genre, one that had been mostly dormant for decades. It was the secondary proof, after the flat but more obviously commercial remake of Murder on the Orient Express hit big that crowds were eager to keep playing detective, even when expert puzzler Agatha Christie wasn’t setting the clues. Only Murders in the Building, See How They Run, The Afterparty, the upcoming Reunion and Retreat, all following.</p><p>Inevitably, more knives would be dragged out as well, the easy-to-franchise setup of same detective, different location providing Johnson with limitless possibilities, a liberating sense of creative freedom after the shackles of the Star Wars universe. In his absurd and absurdly titled sequel Glass Onion, Daniel Craig’s idiosyncratic sleuth Benoit Blanc heads to a private island with a new set of suspects and a murder that Johnson himself has already insisted critics keep quiet. Unlike the original, it would be a spoiler to even mention whose death is being investigated, an even twistier plot requiring an even more secretive review. What can be shared is that it involves an ostentatious tech mogul, played by Edward Norton, who invites a group of old friends, including Kate Hudson, Janelle Monae, Leslie Odom Jr, Kathryn Hahn and Dave Bautista, to his luxury retreat for the weekend so they can take part in a murder mystery game.</p> Continue reading...",

In the wake of the original Crimes of the Future, Cronenberg would effectively invent, refine and then move on from “‘body horror” cinema, leaving a genre-defining canon of fantasy films (Shivers, Rabid, The Brood, Scanners, Videodrome, The Fly) that used the mutations of the flesh to discuss matters of life and death. Since 1988’s Dead Ringers, the Canadian auteur’s preoccupations have been more psychological (notwithstanding the mugwumps of Naked Lunch and the quirky genre return of eXistenZ); from the sexual pathology of Crash, through the stagey Freud/Jung melodrama of A Dangerous Method to the biting Hollywood satire of Maps to the Stars.</p><p>This new Crimes of the Future (the script for which dates back to the late 90s) plays like a throwback to Cronenberg’s earliest outre genre outings and also a greatest hits compilation of familiar scrungy themes and fleshy sci-fi motifs from his back catalogue. It may not be vintage fare, but if anyone’s going to do a slightly creaky tribute to the films that once made Cronenberg an icon of thoughtful horror, it might as well be him.</p> Continue reading...",

She talks about the timeliness of her roles – and trusting her wife to kill off her characters</p><p>Samira Wiley is a confident person. “Extremely,” she says, with a grin that immediately grows into a full-throated laugh. In the depths of the National Theatre in London, in a meeting room so featureless and business-bland that a member of staff apologises for it, Wiley is a big, bright presence. She talks with her hands. When she listens, she leans back in her chair, arms hanging down at her sides, opening herself up, and when she really wants to make a point, she stretches forward and slaps her palms on the table, holding eye contact. “I am confident. Sometimes to a fault,” she says. “If I’m not totally sure about something, I’m like, I will bet you $500…” She laughs. “I can admit when I’m wrong, though.” She leaves it a beat, then, still grinning, sinks back into her chair. “Sometimes.”</p><p>At 35, Wiley is famous for two big TV roles. One, her first real acting job, was in the prison series Orange is the New Black. For four years, she played fan favourite Poussey Washington. After that, she played Moira, an activist turned handmaid turned activist again in the TV adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale. But she trained as a theatre actor and is about to make her British stage debut in the National Theatre’s revival of Blues for an Alabama Sky. She plays Angel, a down-on-her-luck showgirl in Depression-hit 1930s Harlem.</p> Continue reading...",

Here’s three recent howlers</p><p>As a scientist who is fascinated by horticulture, I am often deeply torn by gardening advice. Sometimes, I feel we are incredibly constrained by established rules that lack any real basis in evidence and which can not only put people off growing but actively set them up for failure. Breaking free of these, and embracing the fact there are as many gardening techniques as there are gardeners, is therefore essential to progress the art form.</p><p>However, just when I start putting myself firmly in the “horses for courses” camp, something inevitably comes up – usually starting on social media, then swiftly recycled in slots on daytime telly – that gets the geeky pedant in me exploding in Hulk-like fury.

        "description": "<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said enduring 90 days of an energy standoff with Russia over this winter would prove more “crucial” than anything the European Union has faced in its entire history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, he predicted the West would prevail and called upon the EU to begin its membership talks with Kyiv in the spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There are 90 days ahead, which will be more crucial than 30 years of Ukraine’s independence; 90 days that will be more crucial than all the years of the existence of the European Union. Winter will determine our future and the risks,” he said in a speech delivered at the Yalta European Strategy meeting late on Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zelenskyy predicted Russia would sever gas supplies entirely, but he told Europeans not to fall for the Russian “illusion” that they could make a trade-off by compromising on their values to secure cheaper energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Referring to Ukraine’s unexpectedly rapid advances around Kharkiv, he vowed to fight on to victory and not to strike a compromise deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, though he accused some unidentified fellow world leaders of telling him to do exactly that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We cannot afford to stop. This is my main message to anyone out there who is thinking about something,” he said. “Even to some of the leaders that are pushing us somewhere, into someone’s inappropriate embrace. No, we cannot afford to stop.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Casting the showdown with Putin as the defining conflict to protect “freedom and fundamental values for any person in the world,” Zelenskyy said the West needed to continue to supply weapons, arms and finances to Ukraine. He made a special appeal for air defense systems, predicting a Russian missile onslaught against key industrial and energy plants this winter.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also called for seizures of Russian assets abroad, the expulsion of Russian propagandists from democratic countries and for a “maximum” visa ban on Russian visitors, who could disseminate propaganda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having survived the winter, however, Zelenskyy gave every sign that he was going to prove a big headache for several leading Western European countries, who are scoffing of Ukraine’s right to a place at the EU table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Zelenskyy, the moral argument was incontrovertible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Completing the unification of Europe is impossible without Ukraine,” he said.  </p>",

        "description": "<p>This 500-year survey of art by women is an inspiring, beautifully written corrective</p><p>The Royal Academy of Art has never hosted a solo exhibition by a woman in their main space. The National Gallery was founded in 1824 and held its first major solo exhibition by a female artist, Artemisia Gentileschi, in 2020. The first edition of EH Gombrich’s supposedly definitive The Story of Art featured no female artists in its first edition in 1950 – and one woman in its 16th edition. In 2015, the curator and art historian Katy Hessel “walked into an art fair and realised that, out of the thousands of artworks before me, not a single one was by a woman”.</p><p>And so she created this positive, beautifully written corrective, which should become a founding text in the history of art by women. Starting in 1500 and shooting through to artists born in the 1990s, The Story of Art Without Men brings centuries-old figures to life while giving form and gravitas to emergent voices and covering every substantial movement from dadaism to civil-rights-era antiracist art along the way.</p> Continue reading...",

The boy is bewitched by the car ferry and keeps asking to see the captain, in the manner of a food critic asking to see the chef so he can stand up and shake his hand. Spotting the gruff, smoking man in an orange jacket who might meet this description, I decide he might puncture his mythical regard for this notional figure and tell him the captain is too busy charting our course with his lieutenants to speak with us right now. When given the option between fact and legend, like any Irish person who finds themselves working involuntarily for the Irish Tourist Board, I decide I must print the legend.</p><p>By the time you’re reading this, my son will have started primary school. There, in the real world, he may already have come home in flames, started speaking in dockworkers’ slang, or undergone a tattooed induction into a local biker gang. But, here and now, in the blissful past, we are enjoying a week’s holiday in Wexford, in Ireland’s southeast.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p>(Dead Oceans)The usually lovelorn New Zealander is sunny side up on an album that embraces his inner synth-pop heart-throb</p><p>Appreciators of the dulcet-voiced Marlon Williams will know him as a country folk singer from New Zealand whose balladry often skews sombre and bittersweet. No longer. Williams’s third solo album, My Boy, packs in old timey joy as well as old timey sorrow, then adds surprisingly contemporary touches. The title track is replete with beatific “doot-doot-doos”, a sweet love song that’s a far cry from his other ode to a boy, 2015’s Dark Child (that one dies tragically young). Easy Does It, urges another tune – backed up by a video worthy of the New Zealand tourist board of Williams and friends splashing about on the coast. His Māori heritage is felt, either through language, or through the rhythmic strum of the guitars.</p><p>Williams recently toured with Lorde. The pandemic seems to have prompted an increased appreciation of their homeland, and chilling out in general, in these two Kiwi artists. And when he’s not channelling good vibes, Williams seems to be embracing his inner synth-pop heart-throb. There are blooping keys and retro drum machines on River Rival; Thinking of Nina feels like a long-lost hit from the 80s. Even better is Soft Boys Make the Grade, a tune that relocates Williams’s gothic bent into a killer soft-rock tune in which he sidles into someone’s direct messages. </p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p>Sadler’s Wells; Theatre Royal Drury Lane, LondonAnne Teresa de Keersmaeker creates a revelatory response to Bach, while a gala celebrating the dance legend is full of bravura dancing</p><p>A week of contemplating dance legends began with a bravura gala in celebration of Rudolf Nureyev and ended with an austere meditation on Bach’s Goldberg Variations from the visionary Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker. Though the links between them were not much in evidence (the gala went very much for classical showing-off rather than the pioneering curiosity that also shaped Nureyev’s career), the dancer who regarded Bach as sacred would much have admired the seriousness of De Keersmaeker’s response to the composer’s late masterpiece.</p><p>The Goldberg Variations is a revelatory piece. De Keersmaeker (in sheer black dress) and the Russian pianist Pavel Kolesnikov (in shorts and white vest) enter in semi-darkness and in silence. The stage, designed by Minna Tikkanen, has a pile of crumpled gold foil on one side, a panel of silver foil on the other, and the piano prominent towards the front. Her lighting shifts beautifully, sometimes casting De Keersmaeker in shadow and sometimes illuminating her.</p><p>Nureyev: Legend and Legacy is at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, London WC2, until 12 September and on Marquee TV from 16 September</p> Continue reading...",

The photographs allude to the way certain sites are historically respected whilst other places remain quiet and overlooked. The images attempt to portray a coastline that is shaped by both respect and contempt, where the natural and the industrial are often at odds with one another — however the images also emphasise the pleasures of the often unwitting and eccentric quirkiness of human intervention.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You can see more photos from the project here.</p>",

The National Gallery was founded in 1824 and held its first major solo exhibition by a female artist, Artemisia Gentileschi, in 2020. The first edition of EH Gombrich’s supposedly definitive The Story of Art featured no female artists in its first edition in 1950 – and one woman in its 16th edition. In 2015, the curator and art historian Katy Hessel “walked into an art fair and realised that, out of the thousands of artworks before me, not a single one was by a woman”.</p><p>And so she created this positive, beautifully written corrective, which should become a founding text in the history of art by women. Starting in 1500 and shooting through to artists born in the 1990s, The Story of Art Without Men brings centuries-old figures to life while giving form and gravitas to emergent voices and covering every substantial movement from dadaism to civil-rights-era antiracist art along the way.</p> Continue reading...",

Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said that it was an “absolute imperative” to create “a nuclear safety and security protection zone” around the site, stressing that a nuclear power plant “can never be a pawn of war.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The facility was seized by Russian forces in March but has continued to be operated by Ukrainian staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Energoatom said that the plant’s in-house needs “will be powered by diesel generators, the service life of which is limited by the technological resource and the amount of available diesel fuel.” The operator added that it is taking “all possible measures to organize the supply of additional batches of diesel fuel” to the facility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In order to prevent an emergency situation at the power plant, it is necessary to stop the Russian shelling of the transmission lines linking the ZNNP to the power system and establish a demilitarized zone around it,” Energoatom said.</p>",

And if you’re a casual fan, being able to see the journey in one sitting is illuminating. Most people seem to be very pleased that I didn’t try to explain him. I didn’t do interviews, I just let it be adventurous. Moonage Daydream is a creative endeavour - it’s not a corporate endeavour.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Judge a Ruthian figure; Rizzo rejoins Yankee dugout; Trivino ups the cutter; Guzmán DFA’d</p> <p>New York Daily News | Mike Lupica: With a little less than a month to go in the season, Aaron Judge’s pursuit of history has him on a level of dominance equal to the greatest players to ever don pinstripes — and the star power to match. Despite everything Shohei Ohtani is doing out west, Judge is the biggest draw in the game, and as he chases down Babe Ruth and Roger Maris, his star is going to, somehow, burn even hotter.</p>\n<p>New York Post | Peter Botte: Anthony Rizzo is still on the IL for a few days, but he was back in the dugout for Saturday’s win over Tampa Bay. Although been a hodgepodge of issues for the Yankees’ first baseman, with back problems and headaches from treatment for the back pain, he’s become a team leader in his year and a half with the club and a valuable piece to have even in limited capacity. Aaron Boone is hoping that if Rizzo’s headaches remain at bay, he can begin to ramp up activities again and rejoin the Yankees sometime on their upcoming road trip through Boston and Milwaukee.</p>\n<p>FanGraphs | Ben Clemens: The Yankees have become notorious for being able to take bad, or even decent, relievers and turning them into studs for the better part of a decade. Since acquiring Lou Trivino from the Athletics at the deadline, they’ve tried to do the same, and while it hasn’t exactly worked out, there clearly is a plan. He’s dropped his four-seam and changeup usage, and used his sweeping slider in their place.</p>\n<p>MLB Trade Rumors | Darragh McDonald: The Ronald Guzmán experiment is over in the Bronx, as the first baseman was DFA’d Saturday morning to make room for Josh Donaldson’s return from paternity leave. Despite a strong year at Triple-A Scranton, Guzmán struck out five times in six MLB plate appearances, failing to justify his spot on the roster, and unfortunately making him the easy choice to be replaced by Donaldson. Marwin Gonzalez will continue to get the lion’s share of starts at first base with Rizzo out.</p>",

What was going on?</p><p>I began using HRT patches at 42, after a seemingly catastrophic breakdown that resulted in my climbing into a Sainsbury’s fish-finger freezer. My mental health was horrendous. I felt totally outside my own skin, dissociated, and that I’d lost my sense of self. I told a therapist that I related to Mrs Dalloway, a chronically depressed – and arguably narcissistic and bourgeois – fictional Virginia Woolf character. She suggested that these feelings could all be down to perimenopause, a term I’d only heard of vaguely, in passing, even as a former nurse. Perimenopause, she told me, can be an extremely rocky road, lasting up to a decade before menopause itself.</p><p>My GP didn’t bat an eyelid at my bizarre symptoms, but offered me low-dose HRT patches and described the side-effects as minimal in most people. Some women experience breast tenderness or feeling sick, or headaches but, she said, this usually settled down. I hoped the patches would lead to fewer perimenopausal symptoms and a balancing out of my mood, some comfort and at least some realism.</p> Continue reading...",

        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/free-speech-rushdie/671403/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "<p>Discovering a point of agreement with a colleague is always alarming. The Atlantic wants more readers rather than fewer, after all, and agreement is poisonous for a subscription base, just as it is for intellectual culture. But here we are: Adam Serwer, in a counterargument to Caitlin Flanagan’s essay and my essay after last month’s attack on Salman Rushdie, agrees that the attack was ghastly and an assault on free speech. Luckily he disagrees with us on everything else, in particular the association Flanagan and I drew between censorious attitudes in the United States and the rather more lethal censoriousness in Iran.</p><p>“Americans simply do not live under anything resembling the kind of repression in which people are killed for blasphemy with state or popular support,” Serwer writes. Phew! But there are ways to suppress free thought, other than with a knife to the eyeball of a novelist, or with laws that limit what can be said in schools. Like many others, he is willing to fight for speech against threats of government coercion. But when the threats come from other sources, he leaps out of the trenches and leaves Flanagan and me fixing our bayonets alone.</p><p>If I write a detestable column (again, some might say), how might colleagues react? They might stand by me unconditionally and refrain from public criticism. Or they might adopt a stance of neutrality, with nary a word to criticize nor to defend. Or they might, as Serwer has, disagree with me in writing. (Flanagan and I have been in separate trenches before: She signs open letters; I toss them.) Finally, they might—as Serwer has not—call for censorship or my firing, or try to keep my views out of the magazine by seeking to block the hire of anyone similarly deluded.</p><p></p><p>None of these reactions implicates “free speech” in the legal or physical sense that alarms Serwer. And at a magazine of ideas, only one of these reactions is useful, unless we want to chloroform our readers with harmony. Rancor is good; offense is good; writing a retort, as my colleague did, is good. Trying to get your opponents to shut up or go away is intellectual cowardice. And if you can see why these first two qualities are desirable, perhaps you can also see why the Rushdie attack is indeed related to censorious attitudes by “snowflake libs”—not a phrase I’d ever use, but if Serwer wants to, fine.</p><p>Serwer says Rushdie’s persecutors and these libs are different because they use different means. I say they resemble each other because they have the same ends—namely, to eradicate rather than encourage disagreement. Whether one does so by firing squad or just plain firing is a distinction that matters. Most college students, according to a FIRE report published this week, do not believe that speakers who hold various conservative beliefs should be allowed on campus; I am grateful that these students do not (yet) run a whole country, as the ayatollahs do. But each group is striving to purify itself, to scare off deviance, to mark dissent from its orthodoxy as so vile that it cannot even be discussed, and must instead be rendered nonexistent. The Khomeinists call this dissent “blasphemous,” and the American equivalent is “offensive,” which in certain quarters carries a similar weight: unutterable, unpublishable, to be erased rather than argued against. If you find that someone’s writing, or film, or speech, or play offends and provokes you, do you want more of it or less? The ayatollahs and the snowflakes answer in the same pathetic way. “Cancel culture”—another term I find myself forced to use—is this impulse not to critique one’s enemies but to make them go away, shut up, or seek employment elsewhere. It is not critique; it is the absence of critique.</p><p>At the core of my disagreement with Serwer is a distinction that goes back at least as far as John Stuart Mill, between coercive threats to free thought and more subtle and insidious ones. Mill knew that government censorship is only part of the problem (but a major one, given that the government can lock you up). In On Liberty, he noted that a deeper—and characteristically modern—problem is self-imposed mental fetters, the inability to think freely because of niggling doubts about how one will be thought of by peers and superiors. “Conformity is the first thing thought of; they like in crowds; they exercise choice only among things commonly done: peculiarity of taste, eccentricity of conduct, are shunned equally with crimes,” he wrote. “Thus the mind itself is bowed to the yoke.”</p><p>And is there any doubt that the minds are yoked together in sprawling teams, plowing the fields of academia and media today? No one is saying, as Jimmy Carter did in 1989, that Rushdie had committed a great evil by offending Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. But that is because they still have a sense of shame, and the near-murder has silenced them. Rushdie’s sin is decades old. A fresh evil, unaccompanied by bloodshed, would attract a freshly craven response, dinging the author for the offense caused and if possible banishing his novel to the great reject pile in the basement of Random House. The shock at the Rushdie stabbing is shock at the stabbing, not at the belief that some speakers are so awful that their vile utterances must be stopped, rather than argued against. FIRE found that on some university campuses, one in five students thinks speakers should be shouted down or otherwise prevented from speaking—not just peppered with hard questions, or subjected to protests, but actually stopped. Pity the students, all five of them. Universities, like magazines, should be kinky: bastions of a kind of intellectual sadomasochism, where we willingly subject ourselves to the arguments of those we most despise, and then retaliate, pitilessly, with our own arguments. None of that happens if they do not speak at all.</p><p>Ultimately Serwer accuses me of making “not an assertion of the right to free speech so much as a right to monologue,”—that is, to speak without having to hear a response. But I never questioned the right of PEN members to speak, or their right to suggest that the hurt felt by a few readers of Charlie Hebdo might be weighed against the hurt felt by the eight members of the Charlie Hebdo staff who had their brains blown out by assassins. I do not tell others to shut up, or try to stop them from saying what they want to say. I would not dream of doing such a thing; when my opponents speak, they bless me: I am the beneficiary of their errors. What troubles me when the censorious types speak is not that they speak but that their response is to call for less speech. They can solve the supposed problem of an offensive speaker for themselves with an application of wax to their ear canals. But when they turn their campuses and magazines and theaters and cultures into safe spaces, the resulting inoffensive blandness offends me, too.</p><p>“The culture of free speech is always under threat,” Serwer writes. No one ever said this fight was a new one. Fix bayonets. As with school library shelves, there are those who want more books and those who want fewer; there are those who want more speech, and those who want less. On the shelves, I think Serwer and I agree. On speech in general, I am a bit less sure, although we at least prefer dialogue to soliloquy, which is a good start.</p>",

        "description": "<p>“I’m sorry for participating in the deaf apocalypse.” For a hearing friend and me, this line, delivered in sign language, became a running gag early in the pandemic. She and I had moved in as temporary “corona-roomies” during the spring of 2020. When we left our apartment and pulled our masks over our mouths, she would apologize for having to make communication even harder for me. As we ventured out into the new world of obscured faces, we joked about the deaf apocalypse again and again.</p><p>Apocalypse—such a dramatic word! Yet as The New York Times, NPR, and many other news outlets noted at the time, face masks can create challenges for deaf and hard-of-hearing people who communicate through lipreading. I was one of those people. Seemingly overnight, my long-standing approach to visual communication became unworkable. Friends’ mouths vanished. I roamed shops and streets suddenly filled with featureless people, their speech now as indecipherable as that of Charlie Brown’s invisible schoolteacher: wah wah wah wah wah. Whenever I saw the masks and thought of all they had erased, I felt dismay.</p><p>More than two years later, masks have somewhat receded from public life. Yet because of my experience during the pandemic, I now occupy my deafness differently. COVID has confronted everyone, hearing or otherwise, with our own fragility—and our own creativity. I’ve had to try out new ways of expressing myself. When I meet hearing people who don’t know sign language, we’ve had to improvise forms of communication that don’t depend on speech. The results have been revelatory.</p><p>[Read: When is a caption close enough?]</p><p>Once, that first pandemic summer, I took my bicycle into a repair shop and used my smartphone to chat with the mechanic there. On my screen, I typed, “FYI, I’m deaf, here for an appointment and have a few questions for you.” The technician, a hip-looking, tattooed guy in his mid-30s, took his phone out and typed, too. Our conversation was as easy as texting.</p><p>“I’m going to look at your bike chain and gears to make sure everything is working,” he tapped into his Notes app.</p><p>“Sounds good!” I replied.</p><p>He returned and updated me on what he’d found. Then he checked in about every step of the tune-up and ended our visit by asking: “Can I help you with anything else today?”</p><p>Wow, I thought, this was so much clearer than trying to read his lips. Part of me still felt uneasy as I gazed at his impenetrable face, at all the other masked faces in the shop around me. But I hadn’t misunderstood anything that the bike-shop guy had said to me that day, and I felt his courteous smile behind his mask. We’d had our conversation in a way that felt more mutually accessible than if either or both of us had had our mouths uncovered.</p><p>Lipreading has always been a misnomer for me. As I’ve discussed elsewhere, lips are not books, and deducing what that random stranger might have asked you in the coffee shop isn’t “reading.” Even for an experienced lipreader, certain bits of spoken English always wind up blurred or missing; some spoken words sail in through one eye and out the other. Lipreading involves plenty of guessing.</p><p>Still, I have a lot of practice. Given a familiar speaker and context, I can get the gist of everyday conversations. I attended speech therapy for my entire childhood. Though I would prefer to sign with others than try to lipread, I am reasonably good at passing—that is, at seeming as much like a hearing person as possible. Most of the time before the pandemic, for non-crucial interactions at least, I could get by.</p><p>In 2020, all of this changed. Suddenly, lipreading became flat-out impossible. Mask wearing affected my use of sign language as well: The facial expressions so important for conveying grammatical meaning in ASL had also vanished behind walls of fabric. I wandered the grocery-store aisles that first pandemic spring and searched the other shoppers’ faces more than the shelves, trying to figure out if anyone had said anything, even a polite “excuse me.” Missing information wasn’t the only problem deaf people worried about during those tense early months. As the novelist Sara Nović wrote at the time, hearing people “too often default to impatience or anger” when we do not understand or respond as quickly as we are expected to. I did not want to rouse any unintelligible sharp voices in the middle of the produce section. My chest would clench as I wheeled my shopping cart. I practiced my smizing and waving—or else I avoided all eye contact with other people.</p><p>[Read: When police don’t know about the ADA]</p><p>Soon enough, I realized that passing was no longer a viable strategy. To survive this lipreader’s apocalypse, I needed to explain—even insist upon—my deafness in every single interaction.</p><p>At first, I practiced this disclosure awkwardly. I gestured “deaf,” my hand on my ear, followed by motions for writing things down. I started refusing to speak aloud in public. I remembered the resourcefulness many of my deaf friends already had, and I took heart. My masked interlocutors and I pointed and mimed. Some people signed “thank you” back or tried spelling out words with their fingers. I started to see what happened when lipreading was no longer an option, when hearing strangers needed to incorporate deafness into their world, too. Even if they didn’t quite know what to do, they had also glimpsed, as the bike-shop mechanic did, an opportunity to communicate differently.</p><p>Masks still feel like forbidding ramparts to me. Yet masks have also forced us to be more inventive in the ways we communicate with each other. They remove some of the onus that has long been placed upon deaf people to lipread, to pass, to catch up, to work harder, to compensate. Hearing people too must adjust their behavior. I have beckoned numerous coffee-shop baristas and airline check-in agents to write their questions to me on paper. I have downloaded the app Cardzilla, popular among deaf people for displaying large and easy-to-read text—and for inviting others to respond in text. My phone is now full of notes I've typed to past strangers. I have asked office receptionists to talk into a speech-recognition app; we gaze at my phone together as it transcribes their words. I spend less time trying to assemble spoken fragments into coherent meaning, more time considering everything my body can say.</p><p>[Read: The life and death of Martha’s Vineyard sign language]</p><p>In environments where masks remain in use, I spend less energy answering the common question “Can you read my lips?” Masks make it obvious when I can’t. They help banish the idea that one person can single-handedly overcome the challenges of deafness.</p><p>As the pandemic wore on, I saw nuanced conversations emerge among hearing friends and acquaintances who in the past had frequently relied on my willingness to try to read their lips. Some hearing friends have told me that they also struggle, though to a far lesser extent, to understand people when they cannot see their face. Other hearing friends have taken their extra time at home to learn more ASL, either informally or through classes on Zoom, or they’ve started following more deaf-related accounts on social media. Many of them have done so on their own, without my nudging them.</p><p>Now, as we return to an everyday existence where more human faces are more routinely visible, I still use my lipreading skills. But I don’t always. Sometimes, especially during customer-service interactions or conversations with people I do not know very well, I still pull out my phone and let my hearing interlocutor know that I am deaf and I’d rather type back and forth. I am more practiced at it now. They are less often taken by surprise.</p><p>To be sure, the deafness-disclosure dance can be exhausting. It does not always work like I want it to. I’ve had masked moments when, no matter how hard I tried to inform a restaurant server that I did not understand and they should write down their question, they just kept talking. I’ve missed plenty of remarks from well-intended strangers in airports, then signed “deaf” and received blank or pitying stares in return. I’ve wished that, instead of me needing to pull my phone out or search for pen and paper in my bag, the person in front of me knew ASL. I’ve walked out of coffee shops without ordering anything at all, simply because I couldn’t cut through the wah wah wah wah wah. We already have so many ways to communicate with our bodies: nodding, pointing, miming, fingerspelling. Why do some people fixate so strongly on speech?</p><p>And yet. In my experience, such spoken-language frustrations have become generally less common, perhaps because of everything the past couple of years have brought to the surface. I’ve seen the stores, including my local REI, that have started providing pen and paper near their entrance doors for anyone who prefers to write to their staff. Some state parks display signs encouraging visitors to let a park ranger know if they need more visible communication. Baristas at random coffee shops see me write down my order, and then use some ASL in response. One told me that her mother is hard of hearing and taught her how important clear communication is.</p><p>More so than in stores and other public places, masking has persisted in medical settings. But they too are adapting. This summer, I visited my doctor’s office for a routine appointment. I’d called in advance, using the video relay, to request an ASL interpreter. All went smoothly: I showed up to find my interpreter waiting by the reception area. She had a clear-paneled mask on—and, as I soon found, so did everyone else. Even the receptionist, who I only talked with for around 30 seconds, whipped one on as soon as I approached.</p><p>The gesture felt profound. “Thank you guys so much,” I said as I checked out. “You clearly all came prepared.”</p><p>“No problem,” I saw the receptionist say, her smile visible behind the plastic. “It’s really the least we can do.”</p><p>The pandemic raised many questions about equity that are far from resolved, and we should not pretend that the coronavirus has passed us by and we can return to our old ways of interacting. I never did have an end-of-pandemic mask-burning party, as an ASL-interpreter friend and I once joked we would. The masks we wore to protect ourselves reminded us of other responsibilities we have to one another. They showed us that language is a two-way street. And when everyone recognizes that language is fluid, we can all pursue richer, deeper, and fairer ways of communicating.</p>",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the years following 9/11, anti-Muslim sentiment grew in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2000 to 2009, hate crimes against Muslims spiked 500 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuslim Americans coalesced and in 2020 out of the 1.5 million registered to vote, 71 percent cast a ballot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe political and cultural power of Muslim Americans has grown in the past 20 years as a result of an expanding voter base and record numbers of candidates running for office at both at the local and national level. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the rise in political power has come with its difficulties. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nSince the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks carried out by Al Qaeda on American soil, Muslims living in the U.S. have experienced political and cultural firsts along with an exponential rise in hate crimes, bullying, harassment and racial profiling. \n\n\n\nIn the years following 9/11, anti-Muslim sentiment grew in the United States.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nWa’el Alzayat, CEO of Emgage, a Muslim American civic group, explained to Changing America that Muslim Americans could have stayed silent in the aftermath of 9/11 as a “way to defend their interests and their freedoms” because of hostile rhetoric. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut eventually, Alzayat said, the community warmed to a more affirmative agenda, engaging in political discourse and becoming an active voter block in U.S. elections. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 2020, a record number of Muslim Americans voted and were running for elected office.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEmgage found there were 1.5 million registered Muslim American voters in 2020 and that well over half — 71 percent — cast a ballot. The figure was four percentage points higher than the national average of about 67 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe country has also seen an increase in the number of Muslim candidates and elected officials. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (D) was the first Muslim elected to Congress in 2007. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn addition, Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) became the first Muslim women to be elected to Congress. The progressive “squad” members are two of the most prominent Muslim voices in American politics, elected in the “blue wave” 2018 midterms during the Trump administration.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA record 81 Muslim American candidates ran for office in 2020 across 28 states and Washington, D.C., according to a report by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut these milestones&nbsp;have been accompanied by a growing rise in Islamophobic incidents in the U.S.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nData from Brown University revealed that from 2000 to 2009, hate crimes against Muslims spiked 500 percent. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBeyond former President Obama’s presidency, critics contend that former President Trump’s policies exhibited animosity toward the community including his travel ban, which included predominately Muslim countries.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2020, the Justice Department (DOJ) found there were 110 anti-Muslim incidents in the U.S., the second highest after anti-Jewish acts. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe DOJ&nbsp;also found that religion was the second-most common reason for single-bias incidents in the U.S.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Pew Research survey found Republicans increasingly associated Muslims and Islam with violence, with 72 percent of Republicans in 2021 believing Islam was more likely than other religions to encourage violence.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmong Democrats, 34 percent felt the same.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAbdullah Hammoud, the first Muslim American mayor of Dearborn, Mich., told Changing America that there was a sense of urgency among members of the Muslim American community to step up and push back against Islamophobia in a post 9/11 America.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBefore becoming mayor,&nbsp;Hammoud ran for a seat in Michigan’s&nbsp;state legislature. He shared that doors were “slammed in his face” when he introduced himself.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I knocked on a neighbor, who was a primary Democratic voter, two blocks from my house at the time. And when I said, ‘I’m Abdullah Hammoud and I’m running for office, he replied, ‘I'm disgusted that you're my neighbor,’ and slammed the door in my face.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHammoud told Changing America that one of the first questions his parents asked him when he shared his intentions to run for elected office was if he would run on the name “Abdullah”.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Many told me I would never win with a name like Abdullah and told me to change my name to Abe Hammoud,” he shared.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTlaib and Omar have previously shared that they’ve received&nbsp;violent threats&nbsp;during their brief time in Congress. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring a press conference, Omar played a voicemail she received in which the caller characterized her as a “f—ing Muslim piece of shit” — one hellbent on “taking over our country.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOmar has also received attacks from&nbsp;congressional colleagues including Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who described her as&nbsp;a member of the “jihad squad”&nbsp;and even suggested she&nbsp;was a “terrorist sympathizer.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Minnesota Democrat&nbsp;published a statement&nbsp;last year that called out the Republican party for not holding their members accountable for anti-Muslim hate and harassment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is not about one hateful statement or one politician; it is about a party that has mainstreamed bigotry and hatred. It is time for Republican Leader McCarthy to actually hold his party accountable,” the 2021 statement said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHatem al-Bazian, Director, Islamophobia Research and Documentation Project at University of California, Berkeley said that both Omar and Tlaib experience “constant assault” on their status, personhood and more.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The attacks are not only from the Republicans but sometimes even from centrists or establishment Democrats, so you can see this in how Islamophobia is the ‘big elephant’ or the ‘big donkey’ in politics and has no party affiliation,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAttacks on both Omar and Tilab fit into this sense of defining “who is an American” and who's not, according to al-Bazian.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It's constantly trying to delegitimize who they are and in essence their religion and constant demonization because of their religion,” he added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut despite these challenges, Muslim Americans are not only increasing their presence in politics but also in American pop culture.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMarvel Studios showcased its first Pakistani-American character in its Ms. Marvel series while Netflix has featured Palestinian-American comedian Mo Amer’s scripted show and Indian-American Hasan Minhaj’s stand up specials.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAl-Bazian said that despite representations in cinema and entertainment, they are not a sign prejudice against Muslims has been eradicated. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“For any community to have the space to be able to articulate and narrate stories about themselves is a positive development,” he said. “But if we take inclusion on the screen, and in different settings, as a sign that racism and Islamophobia is at an end, then the Black and Jewish community’s strides in cinema would show that the strong currents of racism still persist.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe added that there’s still an “avalanche” of negative content out there in both television shows and movies where Muslims are portrayed as terrorists.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHammoud says that he hopes these “firsts” of Muslim representation are not the last. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The hope is that they're not the last to hold that office or to have their own TV shows and films. What I hope is that if my daughter Maryam decides to run for office, I hope that her name is welcomed and it's not challenged because of who she is,” he added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“That if somebody with an accent runs for office, people aren't apprehensive. I think that there's no office that's out of sight for Muslim Americans,” he said.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Former Attorney General William Barr has emerged as one of the most prominent conservatives to suggest former President Trump may be in serious legal jeopardy over his handling of sensitive materials, underscoring the growing divide between the former president and his onetime staunch ally.\n\n\n\nBarr has become a regular presence on Fox News over the past few weeks, weighing in on the FBI search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and subsequent court battles over what the Department of Justice (DOJ) can do with what it found.\n\n\n\nIt’s not the first time Barr, a frequent target of criticism from Democrats as attorney general, has broken with Trump. Nor is he the first former Trump Cabinet member to become critical of the former president.\n\n\n\nBut he has stood out recently for his willingness to undercut not just Trump’s own defense but the preferred narrative of Trump’s allies and wide swaths of the Republican Party.\n\n\n\n“Bill Barr has been a real law and order kind of guy and has been strongly protective of national security interests and Department of Justice interests,” said Alan Morrison, a law professor at George Washington University.\n\n\n\n“And I think he’s always seen himself as being on that side: Tough on people who violate criminal laws, and I think his remarks here are in keeping with that. He’s trying to protect the Justice Department, which he headed not once but twice,” Morrison said.\n\n\n\nBarr has in fact just done that, offering defenses of the Justice Department and the legitimacy of its investigation into Trump in a series of Fox News appearances over the past two weeks.\n\n\n\nThe former attorney general earlier in the month pushed back on various defenses Trump and his team have offered in response to the FBI raid, telling Fox News he was skeptical that Trump had declassified everything he took to Mar-a-Lago as the former president had claimed.\n\n\n\n“Let me just say, I think the driver on this from the beginning was loads of classified information sitting in Mar-a-Lago. People say this [raid] was unprecedented — well, it's also unprecedented for a president to take all this classified information and put them in a country club, okay,\" Barr said.\n\n\n\nBarr has also been critical of Trump’s push for a special master to review the documents taken by the FBI. The former attorney general called the legal strategy a “red herring” since federal authorities likely had already sifted through most of the seized materials.\n\n\n\nBarr urged the Justice Department this week to appeal Judge Aileen Cannon’s ruling in favor of appointing a special master, calling the decision “deeply flawed in a number of ways.”\n\n\n\nIn an appearance on Fox on Thursday, Barr said he believes the Justice Department is “getting very close” to the point where they could indict someone in the case, including potentially Trump.\n\n\n\nThe comments were notable coming from a man who Democrats and some legal experts criticized throughout his latest tenure as attorney general, accusing him of viewing himself as the president’s lawyer rather than the country’s.\n\n\n\n“I think it’s partially a repudiation of Trump but it’s much more in wearing his law and order hat than a repudiation of Trump,” Morrison said.\n\n\n\nBarr’s Fox News appearances undercutting Trump are the latest example of what has been a steadily growing divide between the two men.\n\n\n\nOne former Trump administration official said there is no love lost between Trump and Barr, and the relationship had been steadily deteriorating since the 2020 election, when Trump was irked that his attorney general publicly said he hadn’t found evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n\n\n\nBarr was a key witness for the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, with recordings of his closed-door depositions featuring prominently in the panel’s public hearings.\n\n\n\nBarr told the panel he believed Trump’s claims about election fraud were “bullshit,” “nonsense” and “idiotic.” One hearing featured video of Barr saying he worried Trump had become “detached from reality” as he raised the false premise that voting machines were designed to rig the election.\n\n\n\nTrump, who has frequently derided his former attorney general as a “RINO,” or “Republican in Name Only,” used the same insult in response to Barr’s commentary on Fox in which he said authorities likely had good evidence to pursue its search of Trump’s home.\n\n\n\n“Bill Barr had ‘no guts,’ and got ‘no glory,’” Trump wrote on Truth Social last week. “He was a weak and pathetic RINO [Republican in name only], who was so afraid of being Impeached that he became a captive to the Radical Left Democrats.”\n\n\n\nWhile the vast majority of conservatives have lined up behind Trump to offer shifting defenses of the former president and criticize the Justice Department as politicized, a few conservatives and former Trump officials have joined Barr in publicly recognizing the seriousness of the matter.\n\n\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, who is viewed as laying the groundwork for a 2024 bid, said in New Hampshire late last month that he was “deeply troubled” by the search but added the public needs to “let the facts play out” and condemned attacks on law enforcement.\n\n\n\nTy Cobb, who served as a lawyer in Trump’s White House during the Russia investigation, told CBS News on Friday he believes Trump is “in serious legal water,” not just because of the ongoing investigation into his handling of classified documents, but because of efforts to change the outcome of the 2020 election in Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania and elsewhere.\n\n\n\nLike Barr, Cobb told the news outlet he believes the possibility of Trump being indicted is “very high.”",

        "description": "Dan Brink\n    \n\n  <p>The hits keep coming for Aaron Judge, but the homers are lagging a bit.</p> <p>Welcome back to the Aaron Judge Home Run Record Tracker! We’re taking a daily look at where Aaron Judge’s monster season tracks compared to some of the other historic single-season home run leaders in anticipation of Judge potentially joining their ranks. We’ll be going by Team Game because not every player’s seasons were in sync with the calendar days and everyone didn’t play all of the team’s games, which makes this our universal standard. Now, onto Game 140:</p>\nAaron Judge through Game 140 of 2022: 55 HR\n<p>Team Game 140: 9/10 — 3-for-4, 1 RBI, 1 K</p>\n<p>Aaron Judge increased his pursuit of a possible late Triple Crown run yesterday, but while he collected a trio of hits, none of them went for extra bases. He was held in check for the fourth game in a row, which has put him firmly behind Mark McGwire’s 1998 pace with 1961 Roger Maris on his heels. I have no doubt that Judge will take the trade-off for the blowout win, but he needs the dingers to pick up again. Maybe improved offensive support in the lineup will help him see more pitches if his teammates can be more consistent.</p>\nRoger Maris through Game 140 of 1961: 54 HR\n<p>Team Game 140: 9/6 — 1-for-4, 1 HR, 1 RBI, 1 BB, 1 GIDP</p>\n<p>After nearly a week without a homer, Maris got back on the board with an assist from the good ol’ “First in war, first in peace, last in the American League” Washington Senators. Maris broke a scoreless tie against right-hander Tom Cheney (of 21-strikeout fame) with a shot into the bullpen that out in right at field at the original Yankee Stadium. That broke the dam for the Yankees, who eventually won by a score of 8-0 with four more long balls (two from catcher Johnny Blanchard) and a shutout by Whitey Ford.</p>\n\nBabe Ruth through Game 140 of 1927: 52 HR\n<p>Team Game 140: 9/13 (2) — 1-for-4, 1 HR, 1 RBI, 2 K</p>\n<p>Maris needed that circuit clout to stay ahead of Babe Ruth’s pace because the Bambino just kept clubbing bombs left and right in September 1927. He dingered for the third game in a row and for the second time in this doubleheader against Cleveland, launching one off Scranton-born southpaw Joe Shaute for No. 52. The Yankees swept the twin bill with matching 5-3 victories.</p>\nBarry Bonds through Game 140 of 2001: 59 HR\n<p>Team Game 140: 9/5 — 0-for-2, 1 BB, 1 K</p>\n<p>Facing the eventual champion Diamondbacks, Barry Bonds actually got to Curt Schilling for three homers in his record-setting 2001 season, but the playoff hero was the one who had the last laugh in this one. Schilling dominated the Giants for his 20th win of the year (a runner-up Cy Young campaign to teammate Randy Johnson), overpowering Bonds on a first-inning strikeout and inducing a routine fly in his only other official at-bat.</p>\nMark McGwire through Game 140 of 1998: 59 HR\n<p>Team Game 140: 9/2 — 2-for-3, 2 HR, 4 RBI, 1 GIDP</p>\n<p>For the second consecutive game, McGwire went deep not once, but twice, as he stepped on the gas in his pursuit of Maris’ record. The hapless 1998 Marlins were brutalized by “Big Mac” in this series after miraculously holding him hitless in the opener. It was already a 9-0 Cardinals blowout when he came up to bat in the seventh on September 2nd with most of the 45,170 still in attendance, hoping to see the home run race rage on.</p>\n<p>McGwire made the wait worth their while, as he sailed No. 58 into the distant left-field upper deck at Pro Player Stadium. At the time, it was measured at 497 feet. A tiny part of reliever Brian Edmondson had to be glad that he was not the only Marlins pitcher victimized by McGwire on the night, as one inning later, the larger-than-life slugger moved past Hank Greenberg and Jimmie Foxx for third place on the single-season record roll call with No. 59 off Rob Stanifer. It was the most ever hit by a right-handed batter.</p>\n\nSammy Sosa through Game 140 of 1998: 56 HR\n<p>Team Game 140: 9/2 — 2-for-4, 1 HR, 1 RBI</p>\n<p>Poor Sammy. He probably thought that he might chip away at McGwire’s home run lead when he send an opposite-field missile over the right-field wall at Wrigley Field against former All-Star Jason Bere. That tied him with the Cubs’ single-season home run king Hack Wilson at 56 and put him one behind McGwire (who just dethroned Wilson of his all-time National League crown the previous day). But somehow, he ended up losing pace when the Cardinals’ superstar clubbed two bombs in Miami. Tough crowd. At least he got to savor a come-from-behind 4-2 Cubs win over the Reds.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Royal &amp; Derngate, NorthamptonFive actors play more than 100 roles as Tati’s 60s satire is transformed into a meet-cute comedy of quick-change physical comedy</p><p>The late, great Observer film critic Philip French, writing in 2009, described Jacques Tati’s 1967 film Playtime as a “satire on soulless, conformist modernity”. Modern life’s mechanical rigidity, all straight lines and sharp edges, is gradually subverted by the bumbling human behaviours of Tati’s trademark character, Monsieur Hulot. The co-directors of this new stage version see the film differently. For Valentina Ceschi (who also performs) and Thomas Eccleshare, Playtime is about “walking down the street and being alive to the other people sharing your space”. In their very free adaptation, Tati’s satire is bubblegummed into a sort of meet-cute comedy. A chance encounter – cue long looks and pink clouds – between Hulot (Enoch Lwanga) and an American tourist called Barbara (Yuyu Rau) becomes the main thread along which the action is strung.</p><p>Tati’s plot becomes a pretext for a demonstration of performance techniques, centring around lightning characterisations, quick changes, physical comedy and sight gags. As in the film, there is no actual text: words are used for their sound effects rather than for communication. The skills on display are admirable. Five actors play more than 100 roles, each one distinct and, usually, credible (cod-French behaviours, overplayed, come across as trite); notable cameos include Martin Bassindale’s Brief Encounter-style lover and Abigail Dooley’s maitre d’.</p><p>Playtime is at Royal &amp; Derngate, Northampton, until 17 September</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Bookmarked A vision of life beyond burnout (ABC Religion &amp; Ethics)\nThe Protestant work ethic that persisted into the post-industrial era helped create the vast wealth of the very countries that are today most concerned about burnout. But it also valorised a destructive ideal of working to the point of martyrdom. To overcome burnout, we have to get rid of that ideal and create a new conception of how work fits into a life well lived.\n\n<p>In an excerpt from The End of Burnout: Why Work Drains Us and How to Build Better Lives, Jonathan Malesic suggests that the answer for burnout relates to moving dignity back to the individual rather than being dependent on work.</p>\n<p>So many workers are at risk for burnout because the degraded reality of our jobs since the 1970s coincides with a too-lofty ideal of work. The gap between our ideals and our experience at work is too great for us to bear. That means, if we want to halt the burnout epidemic, we need to close the gap, both by improving working conditions and lowering our ideals. Because our burnout culture results as much from our ideas as from the concrete facts of our jobs, we will need different ethical and spiritual expectations for work as much as we will need better pay, schedules, and support. In fact, we will need a new set of ideals to guide us as we construct those conditions.</p>\n https://www.abc.net.au/religion/jonathan-malesic-vision-of-life-beyond-burnout/14039320\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Referring to the work of Henry David Thoreau, Malesic talks about the importance of genius.</p>\n<p>We have all read the standard advice on business and wellness websites for how to prevent or heal your burnout. Get more sleep. Learn to say no. Organise your tasks by urgency and importance. Meditate. These are all basically superstitions: individual, symbolic actions that are disconnected from burnout’s real causes. Our workplaces and cultural ideals contribute more to our burnout than our personal organisation methods do. Still, individuals are not powerless in the face of burnout. We do have a role to play in aligning our ideals with our reality at work. And Thoreau, the individualist who preached self-reliance, can help us identify it.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Too much work and too little autonomy contribute to burnout; Thoreau’s program limits work in order to foster self-determination. Thoreau’s individualistic streak means he undervalues community. But he wants to create conditions in which people who recognise their own dignity can follow their genius and thus perform a higher labour: to harmonise themselves with their supreme sense of value.</p>\n https://www.abc.net.au/religion/jonathan-malesic-vision-of-life-beyond-burnout/14039320\n\n<p></p>\n<p>This reminds me of John Spencer’s discussion of personal genius hour. I am guessing this may have been the source of 20% time for companies like Google.</p>\n<p>Malesic talks about the notion of work, what constitutes burnout and the challenge of our self-impossed penance with Waleed Aly and Scott Stephens on The Minefield podcast.</p>The post 📑 A vision of life beyond burnout first appeared on Read Write Collect.",

        "description": "<p>It wasn’t exactly a shock. The ancient and beloved Queen, who had reigned much longer than most of her subjects had lived, was 96 and visibly failing. Leaning on a stick, she managed a smile last week as she invited Liz Truss, Britain’s new prime minister, to form a government. And within 48 hours, she was dead.</p><p>A huge and complex contraption of official mourning, rehearsed to exhaustion over the past 15 years, lurched into action. Public events were canceled. The media uncorked a day-and-night flow of solemn eulogy and familiar images. Rain fell, cold and heavy, on Londoners gathering with umbrellas outside Buckingham Palace. Before the announcement, nobody could imagine—wanted to imagine—quite how they would feel. But when it came, they felt only a slow, numbing sadness, and fear.</p><p>Elizabeth II’s life and reign had formed a sort of weatherproof awning, sheltering a long carpet of years. This carpet of continuity led all the way back to the Second World War, to the foundation myth of modern Britain, when “we stood alone” against fascism. Now that carpet is being rolled up. The Queen and her kingdom were pictured as almost unchanging through those 70 years on the throne. But today her subjects look around and admit that, in reality, almost everything had been changing all through her reign. And they ask themselves: Are we the same people?</p><p>In a sense, the Queen did little. She traveled indefatigably, smiling and encouraging, but unlike most of her forebears, she sought no political agency. Instead, she invaded and colonized imaginations. Up to a third of the British population (including anti-monarchists) has confessed to dreaming about her; typically, she drops in for a cup of tea to ask you—such a relief to be talking to a normal, sensible person!—what to do about her children or her savings or her garden. As the Scottish philosopher Tom Nairn has written, she has been an “enchanted glass,” a mirror in which her subjects see themselves reflected as united, brave, and kindly, loved and respected by the giant spread of the outside world that was once the empire and is now the Commonwealth.</p><p>[Read: No one performed Britishness better than Her Majesty]</p><p>That was what the British were encouraged to see in 1952, when this beguiling young woman ascended to the throne and a “new Elizabethan age” was proclaimed. But nothing of that sort followed. The first Elizabeth had launched English colonists and conquerors across the oceans. The second Elizabeth had to sit and watch Great Britain diminish in the world, as its colonies struggled to their feet and marched off to independence. That enchanted glass has turned out to be a distorting mirror. But the Queen projected a calm assurance that nothing had really changed, that Britain was still the same world-leading, stable old country that had emerged after the defeat of Hitler. This soothing story has kept her people comforting themselves in that false reflection.</p><p>With her passing, the deepest-laid question is exposed: What is Britain?</p><p>Elizabeth II kept Britain going, in the sense that English people, who comprise roughly 80 percent of Britain’s population, looked into her mirror and saw a multiple United Kingdom, a nation whose “family” (to use her word) reached across distant continents and oceans. But to many Scottish or Welsh people, England, Scotland, and Wales are the nations, and the U.K. is the state that incorporates them. The Crown itself has helped disguise an often overbearing Englishness as British. And with the Queen’s departure, the fissures papered over by this mystification of an overarching British identity are bound to widen.</p><p>During the latter part of her reign, Elizabeth was unable to hide her anxiety over the growing movement for Scottish independence. Even the grant of devolved autonomy to Scotland and Wales in 1999, which gave each its own national Parliament with limited powers, was known to worry her. Her subsequent joy that the Scots narrowly rejected independence in the 2014 referendum also became public. Now, however, the political tensions gradually pulling the United Kingdom apart have no plausible image maker to restrain them.</p><p>In her person, Elizabeth bore up a tradition of English aristocratic culture—horses, dogs, country houses, a shooting estate in the Scottish Highlands—that is rapidly dying out (and with which her son King Charles III seems uncomfortable). But she proved to be far more than the epitome of posh. Decades ago, she managed to subdue her peculiar 1930s upper-class accent (“hice” for house, “ket” for cat), which was inviting mockery. Endlessly patient and empathetic as she shook a million hands and asked a million kindly questions, she could be coldly intolerant when members of the royal family showed bad manners or succumbed to emotional crises or, worse, scandal.</p><p>The limit to her capacity or willingness to extend sympathy brought the most dangerous moment of her reign in 1997, when Princess Diana was killed and the Queen declined (at first) to return from her Scottish holiday. For a few days, the passionate crowds burying the memory of their “People’s Princess” in heaps of bouquets and soft toys condemned the monarchy for unfeeling arrogance. But beyond that moral severity, the Queen could be high-spirited, even sharply witty. (When a courtier suggested that she was giving TV cameras too much access to her private life, she retorted: “I have to be seen to be believed!”). Seventy years of Privy Council meetings and discussions with 15 successive prime ministers gave her—so her visitors discreetly hinted—an unmatched store of political experience and wisdom.</p><p>[David Frum: How she did it]</p><p>A pity for historians that those conversations could not be recorded—and perhaps that we cannot be sure which prime ministers she liked best. Margaret Thatcher clearly grated on her. Insofar as the Queen’s political views were discernible, they seem to have been close to an old-fashioned, “one nation” caring conservatism rather than the neoliberal dogmas that captured the Tory Party.</p><p>Initially, little will change. The new King Charles III faces months of gaudy English pageantry—heralds trumpeting, golden state coaches, full-dress military parades, a funeral, a coronation—before he can get down to work. He has made an unexpectedly confident start, but, despite dalliances with environmental issues and the like, he is hardly the rebel. He is unlikely to separate the monarchy from its bizarre financial, legal, and constitutional privileges, which include exemption from laws affecting royal income or estates and the right—long disused but still on the books—to fire a government. The Queen’s reign was—for England, above all—a long, tranquilizing slumber. But waking up, a far less deferential people, far more willing to challenge power, faces two linked emergencies.</p><p>One is territorial; the other is constitutional. First, King Charles’s United Kingdom shows signs of breaking up. The national assemblies in Scotland and Wales—the former ruled by a Scottish National Party majority, the latter by a Labour Party one—have been overruled for more than decade by Tory governments in London that owe their electoral mandate to the U.K.’s English populace. This is not a sustainable partnership, and the independence movements grow stronger. In Northern Ireland, the recent electoral victory of the nationalist Sinn Fein party is an indication that, sooner or later, the province will probably quit the United Kingdom for a united Ireland (and for membership in the European Union). The last time a British monarch truly intervened in politics was over this very Irish question, when in 1921 the late Queen’s grandfather George V pushed the British government into ending the bloodshed in Ireland and opening negotiations for an independent Free State.</p><p>Britain’s unwritten constitution is profoundly monarchical—not because a hereditary king or queen is head of state but because it embodies an antique idea of absolute authority. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, England overthrew royal absolutism—ending, once and for all, the supposed “divine right of kings”—but then transferred that absolute power to Parliament. The archaic English doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty means that, in theory, a prime minister with a House of Commons majority can impose their will, unhindered by any bill of rights.</p><p>[Read: The second Elizabethan age has ended]</p><p>The Enlightenment concept of popular sovereignty, of power leased upward from below, is alien to English-dominated British governance. Power in this old country still flows from the top down. The system is almost designed for tyrants, yet politicians over the years have hung democratic drapery (universal suffrage, free speech, independent judiciary) over this autocratic armature. Today, that compromise is looking threadbare. A less reflexively respectful generation has watched recent British governments trample over the conventions supposed to constrain executive power, most conspicuously during the Brexit debates, when Boris Johnson illegally attempted to shut down Parliament with a “prorogation.”</p><p>The Elizabethan years assured the people that Britain remained a good, sound country, in spite of many a crisis, under the blessing of its monarchy. They are no longer so sure. They want more rights, more control, less advice to be quiet and keep believing. For the moment, a rock-solid residue of faith in the House of Windsor abides, especially in England. But when the tide of grief recedes, in dire economic times, royal privilege and royalty itself will be questioned, starting at the United Kingdom’s periphery and working inward.</p><p>Elizabeth II tried to preserve the mystery cult of the Crown but ended up being loved and revered for the person she was. Dangerous! The mirror of monarchy then loses its enchantment. If the symbols of the sovereign matter less than the mortal who wears them, Charles III will reign unprotected except by his own merits. If he or a successor stumbles and falls, the Crown—the monarchy itself—might fall with them.</p>",

        "description": "<p>One of Donald Trump’s biggest effects on American politics has been bringing ideas that used to be considered fringe into the mainstream. Although the most glaring examples include things like election subversion or cozying up to white supremacists, this summer has seen another previously outré idea become more common: prosecuting a former president.</p><p>For more than two centuries, law-enforcement agencies have shied away from or otherwise been able to avoid criminal investigations of former presidents. That’s not because they were models of probity. Warren Harding had the good sense to die before the Teapot Dome scandal broke. Richard Nixon, who said he was not a crook, was one but benefited from a pardon from his successor, Gerald Ford. Bill Clinton struck a deal to resolve his legal difficulties in the closing days of his presidency. Going after a former president has been seen as a move that is divisive at best and at worst could create a norm of persecuting political opponents. Until recently, even many consistent Trump critics have rejected the idea of charging him with crimes.</p><p>[Paul Rosenzweig: Trump has justified breaking one of America’s most sacred norms]</p><p>No more—now it is another taboo discarded. Over the summer of 2022, the conventional wisdom among pundits seems to have shifted from skepticism or agnosticism about criminally investigating Trump to support for investigations and a sense that an indictment is not only ever more likely but possibly even preferable. In late August, the New York Times editorial board wrote that prosecuting Trump was “a necessary first step” toward fixing “the greatest crisis in American democracy since the Civil War.” Commentators who have previously worried about the downside of a prosecution now see it as both likely and justified. Even the Times columnist Ross Douthat, a staunch Trump critic but stauncher conservative, is resigned to criminal cases against Trump while warning that the Justice Department must not make any errors.</p><p>The shift is primarily a product of the explosive disclosures about Trump removing public records from the White House, including highly sensitive ones, then allegedly lying about handing them over and attempting to obstruct the investigation. Compared with some of Trump’s previous scandals, this one is relatively easy to understand. The presence of classified info may rattle the former national-security officials who make up much of the legal commentariat in a way other controversies did not. Also, unlike other scandals that Trump has defused by misbehaving in the open, his subterfuge here creates an aura of guilt.</p><p>But the shift began even before the classified-documents scandal broke, with the slow corrosion of Trump’s standing with Republicans and the public inflicted by the House committee investigating his attempts to overturn the election. The committee’s hearings have demonstrated the depth and tenacity of the president’s efforts to subvert the results of the race before January 6 as well as his exhortation and approval of the riot that happened that day. These revelations have shaken even conservative commentators who are wary of prosecuting Trump.</p><p>Some people long ago decided Trump is a proper focus for law enforcement. In October 2020, the veteran Republican lawyer Paul Rosenzweig argued in The Atlantic that Trump should not be immune from criminal investigation and, if merited, prosecution, after he left office. Although many Democratic voters likely agreed with him, the position placed Rosenzweig outside the mainstream of legal commentary, which, like the judicial system, tends to put great faith in precedent. “There are no easy answers here,” he conceded before concluding, “It would be too great an affront to law for a president to have perpetual immunity.” (Rosenzweig has warned against expecting the justice system to solve the political problem posed by Trump, as have I, but this is separate from whether investigations are the right thing to do.)</p><p>[Adam Serwer: If it were anyone else, they’d be prosecuted]</p><p>Both the Mar-a-Lago fiasco and the January 6 hearings have changed opinions because they have shown that, whatever the downsides of acting, Trump’s behavior has been lawless and poses a continuing danger. As my colleague Adam Serwer writes, it’s clear that giving him a free pass will not work, because the country has tried that and he’s kept misbehaving.</p><p>Yet even after Trump’s sustained attempt to subvert the election results and his incitement of the January 6 riot, and even after the Senate failed to convict Trump in an impeachment trial (despite majority support), hesitation to pursue criminal investigations has persisted. The common thread among the skeptical arguments—setting aside the sycophantic defenses of Trump—is worry about provoking the former president’s masses of fans, as the journalist Jonathan Katz notes.</p><p>This argument for caution has some conceptual flaws. Primarily, it gives weight to the speculative danger of backlash to accountability, while downplaying the already concrete harms of allowing Trump to go untrammeled. Beyond that, it grants undue deference to the small faction of Trump fans who might react violently—though as the January 6 insurrection showed, the fears of violence are reasonable. But this amounts to granting a heckler’s veto to extremists, when majorities of the public consistently support greater scrutiny of Trump.</p><p>In February 2022, when news of Trump removing documents first emerged, 56 percent of people in a Suffolk/USA Today poll agreed that it was “a serious issue of governance that warrants further investigation.” In June, a similar portion—58 percent—supported charging Trump over his role in the insurrection, in an ABC News poll. The following month, a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll found smaller but still majority support for charges. (Only a third believed he’d face charges, though.) Last month, 57 percent in an NBC News poll voiced support for continued investigations. And in a Wall Street Journal poll released Thursday, 52 percent said the FBI had acted properly in the search.</p><p>Finally, this argument assumes that the damage here can still be avoided. It cannot. Criminally investigating and even prosecuting a former president was once unthinkable; it is now very much thinkable. The person most responsible for this is Trump himself. The situation is, at bottom, a tragedy for the country. America would be better off—and indeed was better off—if there were no need to seriously consider prosecuting a former president. His behavior has placed the country in a painful catch-22: If he does not face accountability, the rule of law will suffer and the presidency will become a haven for criminality. If he does, future administrations will likely try to punish their political opponents with prosecution. Trump might face consequences for mishandling public records or trying to overturn the election, but this is a wound to the republic that cannot be redressed.</p>",

        "description": "Queen Elizabeth II’s coffin left Balmoral Castle early Sunday, traveling through Scotland on the first leg of a journey that will culminate in her funeral in London next week.\n\n\n\nThe royal family said the queen’s coffin was accompanied by Princess Anne, Elizabeth’s daughter, and Anne’s husband, Sir Tim Laurence.\n\n\n\n“The Wreath on the coffin features Dhalias, Sweet Peas, Phlox, White Heather and Pine Fir from the Balmoral Estate,” the royal family said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe coffin was en route to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, the British monarch’s official residence in Scotland.\n\n\n\nElizabeth died on Thursday, ending the 70-year reign of Britain’s longest-serving monarch. Her death was quickly met with messages of mourning from the British people and leaders across the globe.\n\n\n\nThe queen’s passing set in motion Operation London Bridge, a plan in place for decades that spans the mourning period.\n\n\n\nSunday’s travel from Balmoral to Edinburgh was the first of multiple legs the queen’s coffin will take over the next week.\n\n\n\n\"A sad and poignant moment as Her Majesty, The Queen leaves her beloved Balmoral for the final time,\" tweeted Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland. \"Today, as she makes her journey to Edinburgh, Scotland will pay tribute to an extraordinary woman.\"\n\n\n\nOn Monday, King Charles III and the royal family will escort her coffin from the Palace of Holyroodhouse to St. Giles’ Cathedral, which is located down the street from the palace. The queen’s coffin will lie in the cathedral until Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe Royal Air Force will then fly the coffin from Edinburgh to RAF Northolt, a base located west of London, so her coffin can be taken to Buckingham Palace.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Elizabeth’s coffin will be taken during a procession to the Palace of Westminster, the meeting place of the British Parliament, where a short service will take place.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe public can pay their respects as the queen lies in state for four days at the Palace of Westminster.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe coffin will be taken to Westminster Abbey the following Monday for the queen’s funeral. President Biden said he plans to attend the funeral.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/3634042-as-with-911-your-government-has-failed-you-again/",
        "description": "“Your government failed you.” With that dramatic testimony before the 9/11 Commission, Richard Clarke, counterterrorism coordinator at the White House during the Clinton and Bush administrations, laid bare the raw truth of the government’s failure to prevent the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 Americans.\n\n\n\nIt was shocking. It was cathartic. It was also true.\n\n\n\nIt — or something like it — has been sorely lacking from the government’s accounting for the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\nDon’t hold your breath. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced they will be taking a hard look at their handling of the pandemic, political officials of both parties have transitioned seamlessly from swearing that they were going to “beat this virus” to discussing the virus as “endemic,” with little to no explanation for the failures to prevent, contain, and even to mitigate the virus’s deadly spread.\n\n\n\nComparisons of the preparedness and response to 9/11 and COVID are inevitable, and were made, in fact, in the earliest days of the pandemic, when a government official, echoing CIA Director George Tenet’s warning prior to 9/11, said that the public health care system had been “blinking red” since January 2020.\n\n\n\nThat comparison no longer seems hyperbolic; in fact, the scope of our nation’s failure to care for its most vulnerable people during the pandemic has been orders of magnitude worse than on 9/11. Ranked in November 2019, on the eve of COVID’s zoonotic spread, as the nation best resourced in the world to confront a pandemic, the United States has the highest mortality rate among the wealthiest nations in the world, and among the highest of all nations. More than one in 400 Americans has died from COVID-19. The pandemic has revealed the nation considered the best resourced in the world to confront a pandemic to be the worst in marshaling those resources to respond.\n\n\n\nContrary to the widespread popular and now bipartisan resignation over our situation, it didn’t have to happen. So why did it? Again, a 9/11 comparison is apt.\n\n\n\nThe national security apparatus in place prior to 9/11, and the public health infrastructure rated the world’s best prior to the pandemic, were the product of trillions of dollars of investment for the same bedrock purposes: to provide a multi-layered early warning system against a surprise attack and to support the institutions that could combat and mitigate the effects of an attack if it occurred.\n\n\n\nBoth seemed formidable prior to the critical events. But in both cases the systems failed dramatically and catastrophically, and for the same fundamental reasons: consistent failures in planning to consider the possible ways the threat could be manifested, and to plan for a response that would align decision-making responsibilities to meet real-world demands.\n\n\n\nBoth crises have exposed as unwarranted the assumptions on which planning had occurred. There were, for example, detailed plans drawn up prior to 9/11 for how the civilian and military authorities would handle cockpit security and hijackings. Hijackings were assumed to be political statements, in which demands would be made in return for an exchange of hostages. In other words, there would be time to react.\n\n\n\nWhen, on 9/11, the hijackers breached the unlocked cockpits, killing the pilots, and turned off or scrambled their transponder signals and disappeared into the radar clutter, and when it became clear that their goal was not to seek to have demands met and land the planes but to use them as weapons of mass destruction, existing plans had to be discarded immediately and the response had to be improvised.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, in the early days of the pandemic, despite evidence of unexplained transmission, government scientists assumed that as a coronavirus, the new disease would be only modestly contagious, like the SARS virus. This assumption led to an early decision that only symptomatic people who had been exposed would be tested. As former CDC Director Robert Redfield put it later, “That whole idea that you were going to diagnose cases based on symptoms, isolate them, and contact-trace around them was not going to work. You’re going to be missing 50 percent of the cases.” Dr. Deborah Birx’s memoir, “Silent Invasion,” recounts her agonizingly frustrated efforts to persuade the CDC that the virus was spreading asymptomatically, and that testing needed to be expanded dramatically (“The CDC was operating in a bubble it had itself created”).\n\n\n\nThe failure to test asymptomatic people who were exposed to COVID early in the pandemic’s spread allowed the virus to disappear from the disease surveillance capability as surely as the hijacked planes had disappeared from primary radar on 9/11,&nbsp;hiding in plain sight as it spread silently, ravaging the population.\n\n\n\nBoth attacks, moreover, exploited the fault lines among bureaucracies. The 9/11 hijackers moved freely in the gaps of communication between and among international intelligence agencies — the FBI and CIA, the FBI and state and local law enforcement, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and NORAD, the FAA and the State Department, and the National Security Agency and critically important agencies.\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 exploited similar silos of bureaucracy, spreading effortlessly in the first instance in the gaps of communication among world governments, beginning with China’s criminal suppression of the truth about the virus as it lost containment and continued to deny evidence of human transmission.\n\n\n\nOnce the virus had reached the United States, there was persistent confusion among the states and the federal government about who was responsible for what. As Lawrence Wright puts it in his account, “The Plague Year”: “It was a national problem, but there would be no national plan. The pandemic was broken into 50 separate epidemics and dumped into the reluctant embrace of the surprised and unprepared governors.”\n\n\n\nBy late 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci, ​​director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, concluded that this state-centered response to the COVD-19 pandemic was probably misguided: “When you’re dealing with a pandemic that doesn’t know the difference between the border of New Jersey and New York, or Florida or Georgia, or Texas and Oklahoma you have to have a degree of consistency in your response… .”\n\n\n\nJust as 9/11 required a major rewiring of our national security structure to account for the reality of transnational terrorism, so our failed COVID response makes imperative a structural realignment of government roles and responsibilities to manage pandemics.\n\n\n\nOur Constitution is the essential touchstone. As long as a pathogen can be contained, states should take the lead in containment measures; federal government agencies are there to support them. Once containment is lost, and the potential for mass fatalities across boundaries becomes clear, it is no longer appropriate for the states to take the lead; in its transformation from an epidemic to a pandemic, it also has been transformed from a public health emergency to a crisis requiring that we provide, as the Constitution’s preamble puts it, a “common defense.”\n\n\n\nA crisis that, by its nature, calls for a “common defense” — the very justification for the creation of federal power under the Constitution — should be met with a unified and empowered federal response.\n\n\n\nThis would require a major realignment of responsibilities that should be defined by act of Congress. But before it can be accomplished, someone — a president, perhaps, or an association of governors? — must lead. Someone must step forward and galvanize reform by calling the pandemic response what it has been: a colossal failure of government. The pandemic needs, in other words, its Richard Clarke moment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe question raised by 9/11 and the pandemic response is stark and ultimately existential: Must we accept large-scale institutional failure during crises as inevitable in our republic, costing thousands or millions of American lives?\n\n\n\nJohn J. Farmer, Jr., a former Attorney General of New Jersey and current university professor and director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, served as senior counsel to the 9/11 Commission. His book, “The Ground Truth,” exploring the similarities of the preparedness and response to 9/11 with the preparedness and response to Katrina, was a New York Times Notable Book. His book “Way Too Fast: An American Reckoning,” was published in 2022.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/defense/3636890-heres-how-biden-has-shifted-the-war-on-terror/",
        "description": "More than 20 years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President Biden has shifted the way America fights the war on terror&nbsp;by&nbsp;launching&nbsp;fewer&nbsp;drone strikes, embracing an over-the-horizon approach to killing terrorists in Afghanistan and leveraging alliances.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFollowing last year’s pullout of U.S. forces from Afghanistan —&nbsp;ending&nbsp;a war that the 9/11 attacks tipped off — Biden has placed more emphasis on working with and through allies to target both new and long-standing foreign terrorist groups.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Biden is also prioritizing&nbsp;keeping a light footprint abroad,&nbsp;including&nbsp;by using&nbsp;drones and special forces.&nbsp;This marks&nbsp;a major shift from the large numbers of American service members sent overseas to fight the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, as well as&nbsp;to&nbsp;far-flung locations including Syria and Somalia.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut as the Biden administration&nbsp;pushes forward with its counterterrorism strategy,&nbsp;it will have to balance its efforts&nbsp;to combat&nbsp;foreign terrorists&nbsp;with&nbsp;addressing the threat of domestic extremism, experts say.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think this is the challenge that the Biden administration is juggling — I'd say generally&nbsp;[it]&nbsp;is doing well,” said Bruce Hoffman, a senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Certainly, I think [he’s] taking this range of threats quite seriously. But part of it I think is not being lulled into a sense of complacency that very resilient and determined long-standing adversaries like al Qaeda have disappeared, even ISIS have disappeared and no longer pose a threat,” he continued.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn keeping its footprint small in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Middle East, the U.S. maintains about 900 troops in Syria to counter ISIS in the country and has re-deployed troops to Somalia to counter al Qaeda affiliate al-Shabaab — a reversal of former President Trump’s decision to withdraw the 700 troops that were there.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe administration sought to prove that it could still fight terrorists from afar&nbsp;while maintaining that small footprint&nbsp;in early August, when it conducted an&nbsp;over-the-horizon&nbsp;drone&nbsp;strike — which&nbsp;didn’t involve troops directly on the ground — that killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. But whether the over-the-horizon approach works is still up for debate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Al-Zawahiri was tracked to Kabul, but he was hiding in plain sight. I’m not sure that it's proof of the over-the-horizon strategy working. That's disrupting major terrorist plots and taking out the mid-level commanders, and the operations personnel,” Hoffman said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome terrorism experts see Biden shifting toward a broader, longer-term strategy to approaching counterterrorism that isn’t very reliant on boots on the ground, but rather one&nbsp;that focuses on zeroing in on how terrorist groups grow.\n\n\n\nAudrey Kurth Cronin, a professor in the School of International Service at American University, said a big part of this is the Department of Defense’s&nbsp;recent efforts to mitigate civilian harm resulting from U.S. military activities.&nbsp;The Pentagon unveiled the Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan on Aug. 25, which directs sweeping changes in military planning, training, doctrine and policy for future conflicts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNot only would a plan like this protect local civilians — who are always impacted by terrorism — but it helps when dealing with&nbsp;terrorist&nbsp;groups that rely on mobilizing grassroots support.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The only way that you can end groups that rely on mobilization — groups like al Qaeda and also ISIS — is to reduce the number of people that are likely to either actively or passively support them,” she said. “One way to do that ... is to absolutely minimize the impact on civilians and to be very transparent with how you do that.”\n\n\n\nOthers see the&nbsp;move&nbsp;as a direct reaction to the political fallout of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, which included surging troops to the&nbsp;countries&nbsp;by the thousands with no clear ending in sight.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“My strong sense is that the lesson in every subsequent administration has been to try and keep military action off the front pages as absolutely as much as possible,” said Ret. Army Col. Gregory Daddis,&nbsp;a professor of U.S. military history at the San Diego State University who served in Iraq.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the U.S.,&nbsp;the administration has looked to combat domestic terrorism, which&nbsp;the FBI defines as&nbsp;violent, criminal acts committed by people or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House&nbsp;released a strategy&nbsp;in June 2021 to combat domestic terrorism,&nbsp;centered around&nbsp;federal agencies enhancing and improving how they&nbsp;share&nbsp;domestic terrorism-related&nbsp;information, preventing&nbsp;domestic terrorists from mobilizing Americans, disrupting their activities before they yield violence and addressing the long-term issues that contribute to domestic terrorism.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCronin warned that domestic terrorism is difficult&nbsp;to&nbsp;address&nbsp;because efforts to do so can easily&nbsp;bleed into&nbsp;current domestic polarization&nbsp;by giving the appearance of making largely political choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It's a situation in the United States where our domestic laws are much more difficult to align with, compared to the laws that we use in order to fight international terrorism,” she said. “That’s for a good reason — we're protecting domestic rights, we have a Constitution, [it's] very tricky to define exactly what terrorism means domestically without becoming very political.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMoving forward, experts say that Biden will have to be able to allocate resources wisely as he deals with multiple counterterrorism challenges — particularly as acute threats caused by Russia, China and the pandemic&nbsp;emerge.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think the American public and republics of many countries throughout the world, not just in the West, are tired of the War on Terror the same way they're tired of the global pandemic, and they want to put&nbsp;both of them&nbsp;in the rearview mirror. I think the main challenge for the Biden administration is to be able to develop a flexible and adaptive security strategy that enables us to focus on the array of&nbsp;really unprecedented&nbsp;threats that a presidential administration faces now,” Hoffman said.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

        "description": "Painting, essay, and photograph by Robert Beck.\n<p>Artist Robert Beck takes time to consider those little birds in the park.</p>\n<p>By Robert Beck</p>\n<p>I used to go into the park three or four times a day for dog walks when Jack was alive. Now it’s just a few times a week to stretch my legs. Jack was a large and very handsome dog, often mistaken for George Clooney. He had a way of identifying people who had treats in their pockets and politely sitting in front of them with his tail sweeping the ground and a big smile on his face. It always worked. Sometimes twice.</p>\n<p>This past week had a couple of four-star weather days that found me working inside the apartment. I could see the branches on the trees at the park swaying gently, and finally decided I could gather my thoughts there just as well as at my desk. I grabbed a pen and copybook and slipped out for an off-site.</p>\n<p>I walked into the park to one of those long rows of green benches on a path removed from the more traveled road. About a dozen properly-distanced people were reading and looking at their phones. A lady conveniently got up just as I arrived, so I didn’t have to break the spacing rhythm. I sat down, opened the book on my leg, and surrendered to the sunlight and late summer breeze.</p>\n<p>My thoughts were lazily adrift when a little bird appeared on the fence across the path, then three. By the time I focused on them, there were seven, lightly perched on one of those wire mesh barriers that doesn’t stop anybody from doing whatever they want. The birds jumped down to the ground in front of my feet, were replaced by more, and joined from the sides until three or four dozen small, brown, twitching featherballs were spread out in front of me, also equally distanced, and keen on keeping me in sight. Not interested in any of my benchmates, though; just me.</p>\n<p>I don’t know a Junko from a Nuthatch. To me, they all look like small brownish birds, except some have stripes on their heads, yellow bits on their tails, or dark hoods. I think these were sparrows. We regarded each other for a while, me motionless, them hopping and flitting, always keeping one eye in my direction. I suppose they were looking for food, but they didn’t display the suave charm that Jack had used to great success.</p>\n<p>Then, by unanimous agreement, it was decided they needed to be somewhere else. The flock lifted off the ground as one, and scooted down the path in a flurry, into the trees and out of sight. Someplace to go. Something to do. Someone else to examine.</p>",

        "description": "Basic goal for the Orioles: Don’t have the game end with a Red Sox victory handshake line. | Photo by Greg Fiume/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Submitted: It is bad for the Orioles to give up 17 runs in one game.</p> <p>Hello, friends.</p>\n<p>The Orioles sure picked a bad time to have their most lopsided defeat of the season. At this point, they can’t give away any no-chancer games, and that’s exactly what they played yesterday. There’s nothing quite like trailing 4-0 before the starting pitcher even records an out. When the dust settled, the O’s fell to the Red Sox, 17-4. That’s pretty bad. Check out John Beers’s recap for the not-so-lovely totals.</p>\n<p>The loss leaves the Orioles at 73-66. It’s a fine record. If they close out the season at that pace, they’ll end up at 85-77. When you think about where we all believed the team would be for this season back in April, that’s an amazing accomplishment. The only thing that hurts about it is that they got close enough to make us think maybe they were even better than that, and then it turned out that maybe they aren’t. </p>\n<p>If they are, they’re going to have to get back to showing it quickly. Though the Orioles do remain in the top challenger spot for a wild card, so at least there’s nobody else in the way, they now look up at a five game deficit to the Seattle Mariners for the third and final spot. Making up five games in the span of 23 is a tough ask. It remains theoretically possible. </p>\n<p>The elimination number for the Orioles - their losses, or Mariners wins - stands at 19. So the O’s need to go like 17-6 and the Mariners can’t do better than 12-11. Except it’s even worse than that because Seattle holds the tiebreaker over the O’s, so the Orioles must finish one win better. The five game deficit is really six games. It’s just... very unlikely, especially with the Mariners having a near-cakewalk schedule remaining. </p>\n<p>The Red Sox await again this afternoon at 1:05. Both Maryland-based professional football teams kick off their week 1 games at 1:00, so who knows how many people will even be tuning in to watch the Orioles try to keep things from slipping entirely away. Kyle Bradish pitches for the O’s, with Rich “The Blister” Hill taking the mound for the Red Sox.</p>\nAround the blogO’sphere\n<p>Notes on Bautista, Henderson, Hays, and others (School of Roch)The big thing to be aware of from yesterday was manager Brandon Hyde saying that the reason he didn’t have closer Félix Bautista pitch in Friday’s win is that Bautista was still suffering from some arm fatigue after his two inning outing on Tuesday. The Orioles went the wrong way about making sure he wasn’t needed on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Orioles notes: Ownership, Elias, Rutschman, Offseason (MLBTR)The good folks at MLBTR had some thoughts on some recent Orioles news, including the latest round of court filings in the Angelos family drama. These filings state that GM Mike Elias reporting directly and only to John Angelos is written into his contract, and that it was now-disfavored brother Louis who was responsible for Brady Anderson hanging around. Nothing public about this court stuff has made me feel like Louis should be the one in charge.</p>\n<p>Orioles’ offseason should be interesting (Baltimore Baseball)For the first time since Elias has been in charge, it feels like there could and should be some significant activity to actually add pieces to the major league team. I hope he’s better at this part of the process than Dan Duquette was.</p>\nBirthdays and Orioles anniversaries\n<p>Today in 2019, Jonathan Villar hit a three-run home run in the seventh inning that broke a 2-2 tie against the Dodgers on the way to a 7-3 victory. The home run was significant for being the 6,106th home run hit in MLB that year, setting a new record. The league went on to finish with 6,776 combined homers. </p>\n<p>The 2019 Orioles, of course, did more than their part to set this record, since O’s pitchers allowed a record 305 home runs. Before yesterday’s games, there had been 4,451 home runs hit in MLB this year. The Orioles had allowed 147 of these.</p>\n<p>There are several former Orioles who were born on this day. They are: 2021 infielder Domingo Leyba, 2018-20 reliever Evan Phillips, 2019-21 reliever Shawn Armstrong, 2018-19 pitcher Andrew Cashner, and 1957-58 four-game infielder Eddie Miksis.</p>\n<p>Is today your birthday? Happy birthday to you! Your birthday buddies for today include: novelist D. H. Lawrence (1885), college football coach Bear Bryant (1913), singer-songwriter Moby (1965), actress Taraji P. Henson (1970), and rapper Ludacris (1977).</p>\nOn this day in history...\n<p>In 9, the Roman Empire was beaten by an alliance of Germanic tribes in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. One effect of the battle is that Rome decided to make the Rhine River its northern border.</p>\n<p>In 1792, during the French Revolution, a number of crown jewels were stolen, including the diamond now on display in the Smithsonian, the Hope diamond. Believed to be more than twice as large but more crudely cut at this time when it was the “French Blue”, the Hope appeared in its modern recognized form in 1839 and was donated to the museum in 1958.</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>And that’s the way it is in Birdland on September 11. Have a safe Sunday. Go O’s!</p>",

Time after time, his attorneys have been asked to testify as witnesses to potential crimes — or evaluated as possible criminal conspirators themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“While the consequences his lawyers faced were extraordinary when Mr. Trump was in the White House, the dangers have only intensified since he left office and have become increasingly acute in recent weeks, as the former president has come under scrutiny in two different Justice Department investigations and has been forced yet again to find lawyers willing to represent him.”</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Bob Levey/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The league had some wild results last night.</p> <p>The Yankees got a must-win game against Tampa Bay, assuring that they’ll have the season series in hand with a game to go — something that could unfortunately matter with how suddenly close this division has gotten. In the meantime, the rest of the league had some high-scoring affairs to check in on, so let’s do just that:</p>\n\nToronto Blue Jays 11 (78-60), Texas Rangers 7 (59-79)\n\n<p>This game was dictated by the bottom of the Blue Jays’ lineup dealing massive damage to the Rangers’ pitching. Santiago Espinal and Raimel Tapia combined to go 4-for-9 with six RBI and a home run from the latter, leading the charge in Toronto’s four-run first and five-run third innings. Kevin Gausman did not have his A-game by any stretch of the imagination, but it didn’t matter when Rangers starter Kohei Arihara’s line read three innings with 11 runs on 12 hits with five walks, one strikeout and two homers. Ouch. The rest of Texas’ bullpen did yeoman’s work giving the team six shutout innings and giving them an outside shot once the team scored four in the sixth, but it was too little, too late.</p>\n\nLos Angeles Angels 6 (61-78), Houston Astros 1 (89-50)\n\n<p>The Astros were denied their first attempt at being the first AL team to 90 wins, thanks to an early onslaught from the Angels. Los Angeles jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the first, and after Houston tied things in the bottom frame they grabbed the lead right back in the second. The Halos loaded the bases with no outs and got an RBI groundout from Andrew Velazquez, followed by an out at home on the contact play. In stepped Mike Trout, and the future Hall of Famer launched a three-run shot to break the game open. It was Trout’s sixth-straight game with a homer, bringing him up to 34 on the year and one ahead of his teammate Shohei Ohtani for second in the American League.</p>\n\nAtlanta Braves 1 (87-52), Seattle Mariners 3 (78-61)\n\n<p>Rookie George Kirby continues to assert himself as a playoff-caliber starter for Seattle, tossing six innings of one-(unearned)run ball against the defending champs. The Mariners got their lead in the middle innings, getting a pair of solo shots from Sam Haggerty and Eugenio Suarez as well as an RBI double from Julio Rodriguez. Atlanta had a chance to swing the game back in their favor in the seventh after a leadoff single and an error gave them runners on with no-one out, but they could only push across a single run before succumbing to the Mariners’ bullpen.</p>\nOther Contenders\n\n\nBoston Red Sox 17 (68-72), Baltimore Orioles 4 (73-66): The wind beneath Baltimore’s Wild Card push is beginning to stall after a sweep by the hands of the Blue Jays, and now the bottom dweller of the AL East is playing spoiler to them. Rafael Devers had a monster day, starting with a first-inning grand slam to open an absurd offensive performance from the Sox in this one.\n\nCleveland Guardians 6 (72-65), Minnesota Twins 4 (69-69): Somehow, the Twins have found themselves in third place and breaking even at .500 in the span of a week. The score in this one is deceiving, as Cleveland was in control the whole way — Minnesota’s runs all came in the ninth inning down to their last out, but it became sticky enough of a situation that Emmanuel Clase had to be summoned for the save.\n\nChicago White Sox 10 (72-68), Oakland Athletics 2 (50-90): Sure, it’s against one of the teams in the basement of MLB’s standings, but the White Sox have given themselves a second life with the run that they’ve been on of late. Elvus Andrus continued his torrid pace since getting released from the A’s, hitting a three-run homer to do in his former employers.",

        "description": "Photo by Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Colorado Rockies news and links for Sunday, September 11, 2022</p> <p>Last month, Justin Wick did a phenomenal deep-dive into Kyle Freeland’s recent sinker usage. Freeland’s newfound reliance on this offering has produced mixed results so far this season. Many of his best starts have heavily featured his sinker, with Justin highlighting his July 25th road start against the Milwaukee Brewers where he tossed seven scoreless innings while recording seven strikeouts without issuing a walk, limiting the Brew Crew to just four hits along the way.</p>\n<p>His sinker usage eclipsed the 30% mark in that start and he followed that outing with an even higher sinker output, topping 40% in a start for the first time in five years during his August 10th home contest with the St. Louis Cardinals. But the results were less optimal, as Freeland allowed six runs and ten hits over 4 ⅓ innings in that outing.</p>\n<p>Since that article, Freeland has posted a strong performance in four of his last five outings, with the one flop coming at home against the San Francisco Giants on August 21st. But there is nuance to that start, as Freeland rolled through the first six innings before getting bitten by an Evan Longoria grand slam in the seventh.</p>\n  \n        \n      baseballsavant.mlb.com\n  \n<p>In those five starts, Freeland has continued to ride his sinker at least 20% of the time, peaking at 37% on August 27th against the New York Mets. This shows a growing confidence in the pitch, a development that has taken some time for the Rockies left-handed starter.</p>\n<p>“My rookie year, I was very heavy two-seam. Then, 2018 after talking with Chris Iannetta, and run that we had, he came to me and like, ‘Hey, we’re gonna start throwing the four-seam.’” Freeland said. “But after that, and the rough 2019 I had, I kind of had to take a step back, look at my entire arsenal and, not relearn how to pitch with it, but learn how to use it to my advantage.”</p>\n  \n        \n      baseballsavant.mlb.com\n  \n<p>This adjustment has been years in the making, as Freeland’s sinker usage is back up to 22% this season after cratering to under 10% in 2019. The metrics of the pitch have not undergone a dramatic change, as his spin-rate, whiff percentage and average movement with the pitch are consistent with previous seasons. What has changed is when Freeland elects to utilize the offering, not how.</p>\n<p>“I rely (on the sinker) a little more on the road just because it’s gonna be able to grab that air a little bit better than it will at home, although I have been throwing it more at home lately.” said Freeland. “When I can locate it down in the zone, I can get quick outs…it’s a pitch that I’ve learned to use in a lot of different ways. You know, front hip on righties. That’s one of my favorite pitches to use, with that two-seam. It’s a great setup pitch to get to and then, at the same time, you go down and away to righties where they see fastball spin and then it just darts away at the last second for a weak ground ball.”</p>\n\n\n<p>Kyle Freeland6 IP2 H1 R1 BB8 Ks pic.twitter.com/PcbdT7Fw5J</p>— RoxGifsVids (@RoxGifsVids) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The proof is in the numbers for Freeland. He is using his sinker 31% of the time to start an at-bat this year, a 16% increase from last season. He has shown a similar spike in usage to get to two strikes in at-bat, especially in 0-1 counts where his jump in pitch usage has been almost identical as the beginning of at-bats. This is resulting in more weak contact on batted balls where he is ahead and more two strike counts, which leads into his put-away breaking balls.</p>\n<p>This is the latest evolution for Kyle Freeland, a pitcher that has had to transform numerous times over the course of his career. Whether it be mechanical changes to his delivery, adjustments to the grip of his slider, or an alteration to the sequencing of his two fastballs, Freeland knows pitching is always a work in progress. He is not the pitcher he was in 2018, and will likely never be on that level again. But the same applies to the pitcher he was in 2019. The adaptability Freeland has shown is what helped him find stability between those two extremes, and the progress he has shown in his sinker during the 2022 is the latest example of that.</p>\n<p>★ ★ ★</p>\nMLB, MLBPA finalize card-check agreement as minor leagues move closer to unionization, sources say | ESPN\n<p>MLB and the Players Association finalized a final step in the unionization of minor league players on Saturday. In the agreement, the MLBPA will present union-authorization cards next Wednesday to be counted by a neutral arbiter. These cards will recognize the Players Association as the bargaining representative of over 5,000 minor league players. This is a formal step in the league’s voluntary recognition of minor league players desires to unionize with the MLBPA, paving the way for collective-bargaining negotiations this off-season for minor league players.</p>\n<p>★ ★ ★</p>\nOn The Farm\n<p>Triple-A: El Paso Chihuahuas 10, Albuquerque Isotopes 9</p>\n<p>The Chihuahuas took an early lead on a solo home run off starter Logan Allen in the second inning, but Albuquerque responded quickly with three off their own thanks to RBI singles from Ryan Vilade and Jimmy Herron and a run-scoring double off the bat of Coco Montes. That solo homer is all El Paso would get off Allen, who threw five innings without allowing additional runs or hits. D.J. Peterson tacked on one run to the lead with single in fifth, followed by a run crossing home on a wild pitch in the sixth. Things fell apart in the eighth, though. Julian Fernández was the initial culprit, walking three and giving up two hits on his way to surrendering five runs without recording an out. Ashton Goudeau took his place but didn’t fare much better, getting just one out while allowing four more runs to cross. The Isotopes added two runs in the ninth, but the comeback fell one run short.</p>\n<p>Double-A: Somerset Patriots 8, Hartford Yard Goats 6</p>\n<p>Starter Noah Gotsis came down with an unfortunate case of the long-balls against Somerset, surrendering a two-run home run in the third inning before coughing up a solo shot in the fifth. All told the Patriots put up five runs in four innings against Gotsis before getting two more off reliever Michael Baird in the fifth. The Yard Goats rallied, however, posting three runs in fourth on RBI singles from Daniel Montano, Julio Carreras and Hunter Stovall. They added two more in the fifth, highlighted by Aaron Schunk’s 13th homer of the season, and one more in the sixth, but it wasn’t enough as they were shut out the rest of the way. Grant Lavigne had three hits in the loss.</p>\n<p>High-A: Spokane Indians 7, Tri-City Dust Devils 4</p>\n<p>RBI singles from Colin Simpson and Mateo Gil along with a sacrifice fly off the bat of Trevor Boone got Spokane out to an early 3-0 lead in the first inning. For a while, that looked like it may be enough as starter Case Williams cruised through the first three innings. But he ran into trouble in the fourth, coughing up a walk and four hits which resulted in a tie game entering the fifth inning. The Indians used the two singles and a double formula from the first to plate another three runs in the top of the fifth. That proved to be enough, as they held the two teams traded runs in the final four innings to bring the game its eventual 7-4 final.</p>\n<p>Low-A: Fresno Grizzlies 4, San Jose Giants 3</p>\n<p>The big news in the system was the Fresno debut of 2022 first round selection Gabriel Hughes. It was an impressive debut for the Gonzaga product, allowing just one hit while registering one strikeout over three scoreless innings. Left fielder Juan Guerrero got Fresno on the board first with a sole home run in the fourth inning. That lead wouldn’t last long, however, as the Giants plated two runs off reliever Gabriel Barbosa in the bottom half of the inning to put Fresno behind by a run. The score would stay that way until the eighth when newly drafted Sterlin Thompson drove in the game-tying run, setting the table for a bases-loaded walk by A.J. Lewis to put the Grizzlies ahead by one. They’d tack on one more off a wild pitch, the eventual winning run of the ballgame.</p>\n\n\n<p>B3 | The 1st punchout of @GHughes128's pro career! @Rockies @MiLB @MLBPipeline  ⚾️  #RaisetheBear pic.twitter.com/CqsnJj12Ha</p>— Fresno Grizzlies (@FresnoGrizzlies) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>★ ★ ★</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind our Purple Row Community Guidelines when you’re commenting.

        "link": "https://www.denverpost.com/2022/09/11/jerry-weinstein-rockies-catching-guru/",
        "description": "<p>Jerry Weinstein is one of the Rockies’ hidden treasures.</p>\n<p>Fans might not know who he is, but plenty of players do. For scouts, managers and coaches throughout baseball, Weinstein is an icon. In 2020, he was presented the prestigious Wilson Lefty Gomez Award in recognition from the American Baseball Coaches Association as “an individual who has contributed significantly to the game of baseball locally, nationally and internationally.”</p>\n<p>Weinstein, who turns 79 on Nov. 9, currently works as the Rockies’ special assistant in scouting and player development. He’s earned a reputation as a catching expert, immersed in the details of baseball’s most-demanding position. But Rockies general manager Bill Schmidt, who’s known Weinstein for more than three decades, sees him as so much more.</p>\n<p>“People talk about Jerry as this catching guru, because he does a lot of clinics and videos and technical things,” Schmidt said. “And now he’s big into Twitter, too. But first and foremost, he’s a baseball coach and a teacher. To me, he’s always been a baseball guy.”</p>\n<p>Schmidt first knew Weinstein when Schmidt was a high school coach and Weinstein was a well-known figure at Sacramento City College. Weinstein was the head coach there for 23 seasons, guiding the Panthers to 16 conference championships, two co-conference titles, a state title in 1988 and a national championship in 1998. He was honored as the National Community College baseball coach of the year in 1988 and 1998.</p>\n<p>Weinstein joined the Rockies organization in 2007 when he took over as manager of High-A Modesto, where he managed Nolan Arenado in 2011. He was Colorado’s major-league catching coach from 2012-13 and the Rockies’ offensive coordinator in 2014. His last season managing a minor league team was in 2017 with Double-A Hartford.</p>\n<p>“Jerry is very tough on you, and he’s a hard (expletive), but in the very best way,” said Rockies third baseman Ryan McMahon, who played for Weinstein at High-A and Double-A. “You will never meet somebody with better intentions and with a genuine desire to make you better.</p>\n<p>“I credit Jerry for a lot of my success and I think he’s a big reason why I got better defensively. He always pushed me. Nothing was ever good enough, and at the time, I needed that.”</p>\n<p>Every major league team searches for catchers who are technically sound behind the plate, productive with the bat, and come to the ballpark every day with the attitude of a gladiator. So it does Weinstein’s heart good to know that the Rockies’ current corps of catching prospects is talented and promising.</p>\n<p>“First of all, I have to give credit to Mark Strittmatter for developing these guys because I’m really just an extension of him,” Weinstein said of “Stritty,” who’s been the franchise’s catching coordinator for the past nine years before he expanded his role this year to include field coordinator.</p>\n<p>“Our current group, as a whole, is one of the best in baseball, maybe the best,” Weinstein continued. “Obviously, you always like your own guys. But I think I’ve been around long enough, and I’m really objective enough to be accurate about that. And I think that most of the people in the industry that see our guys would tell you the same thing.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Rockies’ list is Drew Romo, the 35th overall pick of the 2020 draft who’s currently playing for High-A Spokane. Baseball America lists the 21-year-old Romo as Colorado’s third-best overall prospect.</p>\n<p>Hunter Goodman, a fourth-round pick out of Memphis in 2021, is now turning heads at Double-A Hartford, having smashed 34 homers at three levels of the minors this season. Some of the other young catchers flashing potential are Willie MacIver (Double-A), Braxton Fulford (Low-A Fresno) and Daniel Cope (Double-A).</p>\n<p>“I would agree with what Jerry said because we have some quality catching depth developing in the organization,” Schmidt said. “A lot of people are talking about Romo, who has a chance to be a very good player in the majors. Hunter Goodman is probably more of an offensive guy now and we’ve been using him some at first base at Hartford. We’ll see how he pans out behind the plate.”</p>\n<p>Weinstein lives in San Luis Obisbo, Calif., and he still goes to the beach every morning. That is, when he’s not on the road checking out catching prospects or hosting clinics.</p>\n<p>He first started coaching in 1966 for the freshman team at his alma mater, UCLA. Since then, he’s coached and managed at virtually every level, from high school and community college to the Olympics, Cape Cod League, rookie ball, and Low-A all the way to the majors.</p>\n<p>In 2017, Weinstein managed Israel in the World Baseball Classic. Israel stunned the baseball world by winning Pool A with a 3-0 record and advancing to the last eight. The team, built around MLB-affiliated Jewish Americans, beat South Korea, Chinese Taipei and the Netherlands.</p>\n<p>After more than 56 years of coaching, he’s still going strong. Next year, he’ll travel to Cologne, Germany, to participate in a baseball clinic.</p>\n<p>“I’m still feeling great,” he said. “I work out every day and I read a lot and that keeps my mind sharp.”</p>\n<p>Early in his career, he began using video technology to discover what his players were doing biomechanically and how they could improve. His use of this technology has evolved over the years, and Weinstein now produces baseball videos and has more than 25,000 followers on Twitter.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t a great player, but I always loved the game, so early on I started learning and studying,” he said. “I’ve been an information junkie my entire life.”</p>\n<p>During the season, Weinstein watches almost every game played in the Rockies organization on television, from the major-league team to the low-A team in Fresno. Often, he watches two games at once, then sends in his charts and reports to Strittmatter and the Rockies’ front office.</p>\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies’ Ryan McMahon homers again, but seeks consistency\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies’ four-game winning streak ends with ugly loss to D-backs\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tC.J.

The catcher is vital.</p>\n<p>“Of course, the starting pitcher is important, but he’s only out there every fifth day. The catcher is behind the plate every game.”</p>\n<p>In a rapid-fire sequence, Weinstein rattles off the attributes a catcher must possess if he’s going to make it to the major leagues.</p>\n<p>“You have to be tough and you have to have a thick skin,” he said. “You’re expected to hit but you’re also expected to spend time preparing for the game. You have to have the trust of the pitchers, you have to have a personality, and you have to be strong and athletic, and quick. And you have to be mobile.</p>\n<p>“The catcher is the quarterback on the field and the lead singer of the band. Where he goes, the team goes. I firmly believe that.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>At first, Damon DuBois’s fantasy-football league kept the punishment for the last-place finisher fairly tame. The loser would have to let the champion select their team name for the following year, take care of the housekeeping at the next draft, or, at worst, sport an I suck at fantasy football license plate all off-season. Nothing crazy.</p><p>But by the final weeks of each season, league members already eliminated from playoff contention were checking out. DuBois wanted to raise the stakes. So about five years ago, he put the question to the group: What would be a good last-place punishment? And before long, an answer emerged: cheese shoes. “One of our league mates, he just started saying it, and we were like, Dude, what?!” DuBois told me. “And he was like, Yeah! Let’s just dump a bunch of cheese in our shoes!”</p><p>Ever since, the loser has gotten “cheese-shoed” at the live draft DuBois hosts each year where the league members select NFL players for their made-up teams. “We’ve tried different varieties,” he said: sliced cheese, spray-can cheese, queso dip. The main rule is just that the loser wear the cheese shoes (sockless, to be clear) for the full duration of the draft—usually about four hours. Initially, the plan was to use a single pair of shoes season after season, but it soon became clear that the inaugural cheese shoes were beyond salvage. One year, a loser opted for breathable running shoes, which promptly extruded cheese through the mesh. Of all the fantasy-football punishments out there, DuBois said, “cheese shoes, without a doubt, is the best!”</p><p>But, boy, is there a lot of competition. Last-place punishments have long been an essential part of fantasy-football culture for the more than 40 million Americans who are part of a league. Most of them play for money and the sheer fun of it all, cosplaying as general managers who have to construct rosters and field teams each week, but many leagues add punishments to keep members invested all season long. In this sense, they are to fantasy sports what fantasy sports are to real sports, John Fortunato, a Fordham University professor who studies fantasy sports, told me: If the point of fantasy sports is to inject extra suspense into otherwise meaningless real-life games, then the point of the punishments is to inject extra suspense into otherwise meaningless fantasy games.</p><p>But over the years, fantasy punishments have outgrown their ostensible purpose and in the process seem to have gotten progressively more absurd. What started as a practical mechanism to keep leagues competitive has evolved, or devolved, into something far more … involved. It’s not rare nowadays for onlookers witnessing some bit of bizarre or humiliating public behavior to simply assume it must be a fantasy-football punishment. These days, you really, really don’t want to lose your league.</p><p>[Read: A fantasy-football league unafraid to commit to the bit]</p><p>Nothing, it seems, gets a certain type of American’s creative juices flowing like the task of designing novel ways to humiliate or torment a good friend. Fantasy football has gotten so big that it’s an industry unto itself, sustained by oceans of online analysis, whole talk shows devoted to it on the biggest sports channels, and endless forum discussions. If you spend time scrolling through those discussions, you’ll start to see the same punishments mentioned over and over. The most canonical of them even spawn their own subgenres. Many leagues do the now-infamous Waffle House challenge, wherein the loser must spend 24 hours in a Waffle House but can subtract an hour for each waffle consumed. See also the IHOP edition (pancakes instead of waffles), the bar edition (12 hours instead of 24, shots instead of waffles), and the elevator edition (just 24 hours riding up and down, up and down—that’s it). One loser told me he had to watch an entire 24-hour season of the TV show 24 in 24 hours.</p><p>Other leagues require the loser to take the SAT or ACT, usually with some sort of twist—say, that the test taker must show up drunk or high or dressed in a full soccer kit, complete with cleats and shin guards (and must retake the test if they don’t score high enough). Also popular are making the loser do the grueling drills professionals do at the NFL combine, perform at a stand-up-comedy club, or re-create an ESPN The Body Issue photo shoot. Another classic: The loser must take a giant teddy bear (or, in some versions, a sex doll) on a dinner date to a fancy restaurant. And that’s not even to mention the most hardcore punishments: eyebrow shavings, belly-button piercings, and tattoos.</p><p>No one seems to be quite sure when exactly these punishments started, but they’ve been around for at least a decade, and probably a lot longer. Brody Ruihley, a professor at Miami University in Ohio who studies fantasy sports, thinks the emergence of social media probably played some role in creating the phenomenon, whether by making visible the punishments leagues were already imposing, encouraging those leagues to make their punishments more outlandish, inspiring other leagues to impose punishments of their own, or, most likely, all three. “When we start seeing other people do things, we get ideas,” Ruihely told me. “And then those ideas tend to spin out of control.”</p><p>[Read: Sports streaming makes losers of us all]</p><p>Sometimes, the most innovative ideas are genuinely hilarious: One league makes last place live-stream themselves counting to 10,000; another is considering having this season’s champion select a costume for the loser, who must then go trick-or-treating on a day that’s not Halloween until they get candy from three houses. With the new NFL season—and the new fantasy-football season—kicking off in earnest today, we are in all likelihood about to see the wildest batch of punishments yet.</p><p>Other times, the results are just disgusting. Not infrequently, fantasy punishment discourse devolves into X-rated trolling or actual sadism. On Reddit, an impassioned debate rages on over the merits and demerits of defecation-themed punishments. Another common theme is abject sexism—no great surprise, given the demographics of fantasy football, which, according to Ruihley, skew heavily male. Worst punishment imaginable? “Go to [sic] WNBA game alone without your phone,” one fantasy enthusiast suggests on Twitter. Dozens of leagues do some version of “pretend to be a woman”—wear a dress, paint your nails, play the role of “beer bitch” at the draft party. To the extent that fantasy-football punishments constitute any sort of representative portrait of the average fantasy-football player, it is not a flattering one. Think of them as fraternity-hazing rituals for adults.</p><p>Last month, the hazing came for DuBois. His top four draft picks the previous season had all been “absolutely wretched,” and so this year, for the first time ever, he found himself clomping around the draft party in cheese shoes. He went with the spray can, but “that actually was a terrible idea,” he said. He was constantly sliding around in his shoes, and when the cheese started to harden—because that, it turns out, is what spray-can cheese eventually does—things got quite unpleasant. “My feet were, like, hurting. Like, grinding. It was really disgusting.”</p><p>Draft-day discomfort notwithstanding, DuBois likes the look of his team this year. But if things unexpectedly go south again, he’ll line his shoes with sliced cheese this time, plus queso “for maximum cheesiness.” That, he thinks, would be better. Really, though, he’d rather not find out.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/3637363-biden-continues-to-stiff-arm-the-press/",
        "description": "<p>\"Journalists uncover the truth, check the abuse of power, and demand transparency from those in power. They are indispensable. And, at a time when the truth is increasingly under attack, our need for accurate, fact-based reporting, open public conversation, and accountability has never been greater.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was President Biden in a statement on National Press Day not long after taking office in 2021. Hard to argue with the sentiment: Journalists are indispensable to a functioning democracy. The need for accountability has never been greater. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, as we're learning when it comes to so many things regarding the 46th president, words and deeds are two very different things. Joe Biden has been anything but transparent. And journalists seeking to uncover the truth have been shunned and ignored by this president. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It began during the 2020 campaign, when Biden did all he could to avoid the press. But candidate Biden is now President Biden. And that kind of power requires facing the hard and pertinent questions, for example, from journalists in sit-down interviews. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accountability doesn't get to hide in the basement. But that appears to be the strategy from the president's handlers, who seem not to want him anywhere near this kind of setting before the midterms and likely even after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of what you thought about former President Trump and his verbal treatment of the press, he was extremely accessible, sometimes to his own determent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For comparison, Biden had held 17 press conferences and done 22 media interviews in his first 20 months in office, while Trump held 36 press conferences in his first 20 months. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the question is: If Biden has all the momentum many in the media have been saying he has, and if he has such a winning message that is turning everything around for Democrats heading into the midterms, why hasn’t he sat down for a TV interview in more than 210 days? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You read that correctly. The last time the president of the United States did a real TV interview was with NBC’s Lester Holt on Super Bowl Sunday in February.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Is he dodging us?\" RealClearPolitics correspondent Phil Wegmann asked White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The president loves talking to you all. He takes your questions all the time,\" she replied. \"He took [Fox News White House Correspondent] Peter [Doocy]'s question last Friday. I'm sure Peter was excited about that.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How condescending. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and don't bother making the argument that his appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! counts as a TV interview. That was a foot massage by a supporter with a studio audience, not an actual Q&amp;A. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There’s a lot of major things we’ve done,” Biden told Kimmel at one point. “But what we haven’t done is we haven’t been able to communicate it.”“Look at how the press has changed,” the president added. “With notable exceptions, even the really good reporters, they have to get a number of clicks on the nightly news. So instead of asking a question ... it’s just, everything gets sensationalized.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hubris is something to behold. So, Biden, who refuses to speak to reporters one-on-one, is frustrated about not being able to share all the good things he says the administration has done. And he also says really good reporters are slaves to clicks so must sensationalize everything, so therefore he isn’t going to talk to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also noteworthy that Biden has not done an interview with journalists at any major print newspapers since taking office. (That’s nearly600 days.) The president did do a June interview with the Associated Press, but that's a wire service. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Axios's Jonathan Swan, who sat down with then-President Trump in August 2020, just three months before a presidential election, explained why Biden's handlers will never agree for him to be challenged in a one-on-one interview. \"I say this as somebody who has tried repeatedly to get a one-on-one interview with Joe Biden. He won’t do it,\" Swan tweeted in July. \"And there’s no convening power on planet earth that could compel him to do an interview that his advisers deem to be unsafe. This is of course true of many politicians.”What happened to the transparency Biden promised? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the president’s handlers are so petrified because if Biden sat down with a decent journalist, it’s certain he would be asked how he plans on paying for this trillion-dollar student loan forgiveness program. Or how the $750 billion Inflation Reduction will actually reduce inflation. Or why he refuses to visit the U.S. Southern border as millions of migrants continue enter the country illegally, along with fentanyl, which is killing Americans at an alarming rate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or – and this is a long shot given how little this is discussed and scrutinized by traditional media – about his son Hunter and the damning contents of his laptop showing alleged influence peddling-for-profit that launched a federal investigation into his dealings in China and Ukraine. That certainly would not go well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's been 210 days since Biden’s last interview. There are people who have walked across the entire continental United States in less time. Seven months is a very long time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost all news outlets would be up in arms if a Republican administration stiff-armed the press so blatantly. But a Republican administration isn’t in power. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Free passes are all the rage, especially when it comes to Team Biden, which talks a good game about press freedom while squashing it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe Concha is a media and politics columnist.</p>",

        "description": "<p>NEW YORK — Americans remembered 9/11 on Sunday with tear-choked tributes and pleas to “never forget,” 21 years after the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil.</p> \n<p>The loss still feels immediate to Bonita Mentis, who wore a necklace with a photo of her slain sister, Shevonne Mentis.</p> \n<p>“It’s been 21 years, but it’s not 21 years for us. It seems like just yesterday,” she said before reading victims’ names at the World Trade Center to a crowd that included Vice President Kamala Harris and husband Doug Emhoff. Mentis’</p> \n<p>At the Pentagon, which also was targeted on 9/11, President Joe Biden vowed that the U.S. would continue working to root out terrorist plots and called on Americans to stand up for “the very democracy that guarantees the right to freedom that those terrorists on 9/11 sought to bury in the burning fire, smoke and ash.” First lady Jill Biden spoke at the third attack site, a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.</p> \n<p>On Sept. 11, 2001, conspirators from the al-Qaida Islamic terror group seized control of jets to use them as passenger-filled missiles, hitting the trade center’s twin towers and the Pentagon. The fourth plane was headed for Washington but crashed near Shanksville after crew members and passengers tried to storm the cockpit.</p> \n<p>The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people, reconfigured national security policy and spurred a U.S. “war on terror” worldwide. Sunday’s observances came little more than a month after a U.S. drone strike killed a key al-Qaida figure who helped plot the 9/11 attacks, Ayman al-Zawahri.</p> \n<p>Pierre Roldan, who lost his cousin Carlos Lillo, a paramedic, said “we had some form of justice” when a U.S. raid killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.</p> \n<p>“Now that al-Zawahri is gone, at least we’re continuing to get that justice,” Roldan said.</p> \n<p>The self-proclaimed mastermind of the attacks, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, still awaits a long-postponed military tribunal. An attorney for one of Mohammed’s co-defendants this week confirmed ongoing negotiations toward a potential agreement to avoid a trial and impose lesser but still lengthy sentences.</p> \n<p>The Sept. 11 attacks stirred — for a time — a sense of national pride and unity for many, while also subjecting Muslim Americans to years of suspicion and bigotry and engendering debate over the balance between safety and civil liberties. In ways both subtle and plain, the aftermath of 9/11 ripples through American politics and public life to this day.</p> \n<p>But like some other victims’ relatives, Jay Saloman fears that Americans’ consciousness of 9/11 is receding.</p> \n<p>“It was a terrorist attack against our country that day. And theoretically, everybody should remember it and, you know, take precautions and watch out,” said Saloman, who lost his brother, Wayne Saloman.</p> \n<p>By tradition, no political figures speak at the ground zero ceremony. The observance centers, instead, on relatives reading aloud the names of the dead.</p> \n<p>Like a growing number of readers, firefighter Jimmy Riches’ namesake nephew wasn’t born yet when his relative died. But the boy took the podium to honor him.</p> \n<p>“You’re always in my heart. And I know you are watching over me,” he said.</p> \n<p>Nikita Shah wore a T-shirt that bore the de facto epigraph of the annual commemoration — “never forget” — and the name of her father, Jayesh Shah. She was 10 when he was killed.</p> \n<p>The family later moved to Houston but often returns to New York for the anniversary to be “around people who kind of experienced the same type of grief and the same feelings after 9/11,” said Shah.</p> \n<p>Readers often add personal remarks that form an alloy of American sentiments about Sept. 11 — grief, anger, toughness, appreciation for first responders and the military, appeals to patriotism, hopes for peace, occasional political barbs, and a poignant accounting of the graduations, weddings, births and daily lives that victims have missed. A few readers note recent events, this year ranging from the still ongoing coronavirus pandemic to Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p> \n<p>Some relatives also lament that a nation which came together — to some extent — after the attacks has since splintered apart. So much so that federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, which were reshaped to focus on international terrorism after 9/11, now see the threat of domestic violent extremism as equally urgent.</p> \n<p>“It took a tragedy to unite us. It should not take another tragedy to unite us again,” said Andrew Colabella, whose cousin, John DiGiovanni, died in the 1993 bombing World Trade Center bombing that presaged 9/11.</p> \n<p>Beyond the attack sites, communities around the country marked the day with candlelight vigils, interfaith services and other commemorations. Some Americans joined in volunteer projects on a day that is federally recognized as both Patriot Day and a National Day of Service and Remembrance.</p> \n<p>Others observed the anniversary with their own reflections.</p> \n<p>More than 70 of Sekou Siby’s co-workers perished at Windows on the World, the restaurant atop the trade center’s north tower. He had the day off because another cook asked him to switch shifts.</p> \n<p>The Ivorian immigrant wrestled with how to comprehend such horror in a country where he’d come looking for a better life. And Siby, now president of restaurant workers’ advocacy group ROC United, said ahead of the anniversary that the attacks made him wary of becoming attached to people when “you have no control over what’s going to happen to them next.”</p> \n<p>“Every 9/11 is a reminder,” he said, “of what I lost that I can never recover.” </p>",

But it seems that an alternative point of view may now be abroad. Read the opening pages of A Visible Man, and you’ll find that its author, Edward Enninful, the editor-in-chief of British Vogue, is in grave danger of believing himself to be the burning star around which our planet revolves.</p><p>Why has Enninful written an autobiography? It seems that the urge, fierce and momentous, came upon him in the summer of 2020, when the pandemic was at its height and the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis had filled streets with protesters. The world having “tilted on its axis as the most significant social justice movement in decades met the worst international health crisis in a century”, Enninful felt “a familiar gnawing sensation” somewhere deep inside himself. “The world had stopped,” he writes. “Then it had exploded. It was time.” He would now respond to those who’d long begged him to tell his story, and carefully take stock of his career in fashion, scrutinising it against “the backdrop of a world I helped to change too, in my way”.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p>The kids were back to school on Wednesday this week so it felt like I was back at work ‘properly’. Things are still slowly revving-up after the summer break, though, and it was a bit of a rollercoaster of a week, emotions-wise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, I went to see the doctor about the weird thing that happened to me last Friday. He referred me to the stroke clinic, thinking I’d had a TIA. That evening, they phoned me up and invited me in for an appointment the next day. I went along, and they gave me the all-clear, but are booking me in for an MRI over the next couple of weeks just in case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel fine. To be honest, I’m more concerned about the hamstring I pulled on Wednesday and which I’ve only just got back to running on (gently). Relatedly, I’ve realised that while I enjoy being connected to people on Strava, the focus is too competitive for me, so I’m going to continue my efforts with exercise.cafe and try and create a space which is a bit more chill.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The Queen, or to give her the proper title ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’, died this week. As someone I follow commented, she achieved the remarkable feat of convincing the world that the monarchy’s raw power and wealth is actually a duty and a burden. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I just wish we got to have a referendum on having a monarch at all. Might it be worth pausing before we continue into the future with a King and a House of Lords? I’d suggest that the structure of the whole vestigial edifice, along with the attempted silencing of anyone who criticises it, is part of white supremacist culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, now we’re in a ‘period of mourning’ which will have massive negative economic implications which we can’t really afford as a country. Especially right now. And, annoyingly, the football was off this weekend 🙄</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> Here, I published:</p>\n\n\n\nMigraines and TIAsCode of Conduct for exercise.cafe\n\n\n\n<p>Over at Thought Shrapnel:</p>\n\n\n\nAd-free urban spacesCDNs are not phone booksPaying it forward\n\n\n\n<p>And on the WAO blog:</p>\n\n\n\nCreating a culture of recognition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>On the work front, Laura and I planned Season 5 of The Tao of WAO podcast, and have invited some awesome guests to contribute. I had a really interesting conversation about badges with Co-operatives UK, and caught up with some people from the CoTech network who have haven’t talked to over the summer. I had a chat with Ivan and Mayel about user research and prioritisation for Bonfire, and talked to John about user research for the project WAO is doing with Happy Porch and Common Knowledge for the Wellbeing Economy Alliance.    </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Laura and Anne, I continued to work on the Keep Badges Weird project, and we caught up with Mark, Julie, and Don from Participate to plan the next bit of work. I booked my ticket, travel, and accommodation for the ePIC conference in Lille next month. I’ll be doing a short presentation on the KBW project, and it looks like Julie might be coming over for it, too. I’m quite excited to be getting the Eurostar for the first time!   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s another project that we work on that I’m under an NDA for, which is annoying as it’s a pretty innovative and high-stakes one. Laura leads that, and it might never be something we can talk openly about. Needless to say, though, that it takes up brainspace (in a good way!) each Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In other news, Hannah and I celebrated our 19th wedding anniversary this week, which is ‘bronze’, apparently. I got her a bracelet and… some bronzer(!) as well as some flowers. She got me some bronze-coloured whisky 😉</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We went out for dinner and cocktails on Tuesday night, which was a double celebration in a way because I had been getting increasingly concerned before the stroke clinic appointment that my forties could be my last decade. Our kids are at an age where we can leave them for a couple of hours, which is nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking of them, our daughter went for the second trial for the Newcastle United ETC (Emerging Talent Centre). It was ridiculously wet on Friday, with the ball skidding everywhere. Apart from a couple of standout talents, they might as well pull the names out of a hat, to be fair. We’ll see.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Next week, I’m back to a normal working week. I’m not attempting to take any full days off any more, but rather to try and work sustainably from Monday to Friday. In practice, that looks like doing mostly non-WAO work on a Friday, and working intensely for about five hours per day while the kids are at school. I then have time to tinker around in the evenings or (more likely) in the early mornings before anyone else is up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d quite like to do some wild camping, and would potentially have gone this evening. However, it looks like heavy rain overnight, and I’ve got a planning meeting at our house late this afternoon for neighbours. We’re discussing whether we want to form some form of organisation to take control of the land between our houses and the new development behind them. The devil, as ever, is in the details.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Image created by DALL-E 2 (“runner drinking coffee”)</p>The post Weeknote 36/2022 first appeared on Open Thinkering.",

A book of condolence had been opened in the foyer. The EIIR monogram on the Opera House curtains had been blacked out. People sang God Save the King after a minute’s silence. I wondered whether Strauss’s tragedy of uncontrolled desire might seem incongruous or surreal in the context. In fact, its emotional extremism felt even more cathartic than usual.</p> Continue reading...",

It turns out Blue lives right around the corner from Bustan, on West 83rd Street, and had bolted out two hours earlier when his owner opened the door. He turned up under a table at Bustan, where he won the hearts of the staff, who were deciding who would take him home after the manager called 311 and was told that nothing could be done. Blue was put in the dining shed while his future was debated, and that’s where his owner spotted him, literally, the doggie in the window.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> </p>",

The Mets chased Pablo López from the game early and put up an eight-run inning in the fourth inning with a grand slam by Mark Canha being the exclamation mark. The Mets hit three total long balls in the game; Francisco Lindor and the red-hot Eduardo Escobar also went deep.

Time after time, his attorneys have been asked to testify as witnesses to potential crimes — or evaluated as possible criminal conspirators themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“While the consequences his lawyers faced were extraordinary when Mr. Trump was in the White House, the dangers have only intensified since he left office and have become increasingly acute in recent weeks, as the former president has come under scrutiny in two different Justice Department investigations and has been forced yet again to find lawyers willing to represent him.”</p>",

        "description": "Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Judge is pacing the American League in multiple offensive categories.</p> <p>Aaron Judge came into the 2022 season as one of the premier hitters in the game, a three-time All-Star, former Rookie of the Year, with multiple top-5 MVP finishes. The Yankees’ superstar was firmly established in the upper echelon of the sport.</p>\n<p>With all of that in mind, it speaks volumes that no matter how one chooses to look at it, Judge’s performance in 2022 completely blows even the most absurd of high expectations that anyone could’ve had for him out of the water.</p>\n<p>It is the type of campaign that goes down in history. This level of play is special, even in the context of Hall of Fame careers. There is no such thing as a modern career with an OPS+ above 200; it simply does not happen in this day and age. A single year at that level is a special thing, even for the elite of the elite. Among active hitters, only Bryce Harper and Mike Trout have topped out at 198, in very special seasons.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, we could be here for days spitting out different stats to state the nonpareil greatness of Aaron Judge, but there’s a specific point to focus on — especially as he has remained scorching hot, but without the home runs in the past few days.</p>\n<p>With a 3-for-4 afternoon on Saturday, Aaron Judge became the first Yankee since Mickey Mantle in 1957 to reach base three or more times per game over a seven-game span. Interestingly enough, that’s also the last season in which a Yankee had an OPS+ above 200.</p>\n<p>This recent run has allowed Judge the opportunity to at least dream of a Triple Crown, most recently captured by Miguel Cabrera in 2012, which was the only such win in the past 54 years. That frankly would be more of an icing on the cake, rather than any sort of validation of his season or anything like that.</p>\n<p>As of right now, Judge has a .307 batting average that sits fourth in the American League behind:</p>\n\nSS - Xander Bogaerts: .318\n2B - Luis Arraez: .316\n1B - José Abreu: .309\n\n<p>As for the other two categories of the classic Triple Crown, Judge has a firm grip on them, leading in homers with 55, a whopping 21 more than second-place Mike Trout (yes, even in just 99 games), and his 120 RBI also lead the world. José Ramírez is second with 109.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it is still rather unlikely that Judge will surpass those three hitters in batting average, but perhaps a more analytical look can acknowledge Judge as the winner of the modern Triple Crown.</p>\n<p>The Yankees’ superstar may not lead the AL on average, but as of right now, he leads the league in OBP with a .412 mark, and is likely to hold that No. 1 spot through the end of the year. Judge is easily the most dangerous hitter in baseball this year, and his 342 total bases lead the world. The simple fact is that he does more damage than anyone else, while also reaching base more than anybody else.</p>\n<p>Winning the traditional Triple Crown would be the cherry on top, but honestly, looking at his level of play, it’s primarily a matter of semantics more than anything else.</p>\n<p>It does not matter that Judge’s No. 1 OBP has a big part to do with his high walk rate and that there are a handful of hitters or so with more total hits than him, not when Judge’s hits amount to more damage in every imaginable way, whether it’d be runs scored, runs driven in or ISO.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of context, combining runs scored and RBI, Judge has a total of 232 on the year. The second closest is Bo Bichette with 164. These might be team-dependent stats, but it’s impressive to chronicle regardless.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

That’s currently held by the 1899 Brooklyn Superbas at 101-47 (.6824), narrowly ahead of the 1953 Dodgers at 105-49 (.6818). To beat that this year, the Dodgers need 111 wins, which would require a 16-8 finish.</p>\nMost MLB wins in a season\n<p>Outside of their team records, the Dodgers also have an outside chance at reaching the most wins in a season by any MLB team, though it would require a furious finish.</p>\n<p>The 1906 Cubs went 116-36, and the 2001 Mariners were 116-46. For the Dodgers to match that win total, they need a 21-3 finish. Don’t hold your breath.</p>\n<p>But if the Dodgers at least get reasonably close to that record, they could at least accomplish something notable along the way. The Big Red Machine in 1975 and the 1986 Mets each won 108 games. But no National League team has won more than that since the 1909 Pirates were 110-42.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers this year are on pace for 112 wins.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by G Fiume/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>It was a two-win day for the farm, with an exciting walk-off for Bowie and an 11-run rout for Delmarva.</p> Triple-A: Memphis Redbirds (Cardinals) 4, Norfolk Tides 1\n<p>The Tides’ lone run came in the ninth inning when Colton Cowser (#5) doubled, then later came in to score on a sacrifice fly from Kelvin Gutierrez. It was part of a 2-for-3 day for Cowser. Of the remaining ranked prospects, only Joey Ortiz (#24-T) had a hit, a double. Jordan Westburg (#6-T) did draw a walk and steal a base.</p>\n<p>Starting pitcher Denyi Reyes was pretty good in four innings pitched. He gave up three hits with the lone run being on a homer. Beau Sulser wasn’t as good. He gave up seven hits, two walks, and three runs in just 1.2 innings. </p>\n<p>Box Score</p>\nDouble-A: Bowie Baysox 2, Richmond Flying Squirrels (Giants) 1\n<p>It was a walk-off win for the Baysox thanks to some good old fashioned small ball. Cesar Prieto (#14) walked and moved to third on a single to the right side by Hudson Haskin (#22). From there he was able to tag up and score the winning run on a fly ball from Andrew Daschbach. </p>\n<p>Bowie’s first run scored on a bases-loaded walk by Darell Hernaiz (#24-T). At the top of the lineup, Connor Norby (#12) and Prieto each had a hit and a walk . Haskin went 2-for-4, the only Baysock with more than one hit. </p>\n<p>Brenan Hanifee made the start and pitched five shutout innings with just three hits. He struck out four without walking a batter. The Squirrels scored their run on an RBI double off of reliever Jensen Elliott. </p>\n<p>The Baysox win, combined with a lost by the Erie SeaWolves, puts the Baysox in sole possession of first place in the Eastern League. </p>\n<p>Box Score</p>\nHigh-A: Jersey Shore BlueClaws (Phillies) 11, Aberdeen IronBirds 5\n<p>Starting pitcher Daniel Federman racked up eight strikeouts in 4.1 innings. That was the good news. The bad news is that he also gave up four runs on eight hits. Two of those runs scored after he left the game, with Daniel Lloyd allowing them to score along with four runs of his own over 2.2 innings. </p>\n<p>Luis Valdez and Jud Fabian (#17-T) had big nights at the top of the lineup. Leadoff batter Valdez had two hits including a home run, and stole his MiLB leading 71st base. Fabian reached base three times with a single, a double, and a walk. Heston Kjerstad (#9) went 1-for-5. </p>\n<p>Box Score</p>\nLow-A: Delmarva Shorebirds 11, Down East Wood Ducks (Rangers) 4\n<p>The Shorebirds picked up 12 hits and a whopping 11 walks in their beat down of the Wood Ducks. Leading the way was Isaac Bellony, who went 3-for-4 with a walk and knocked in four runs. Douglas Hodo and Adam Crampton, both 2022 draft picks, also had two hits apiece. Wilkin Grullon only had one hit, but it was a two-run homer. </p>\n<p>Jackson Holliday (#3) had the day off. </p>\n<p>Starting pitcher Keegan Gillies had a forgettable start in which he gave up four runs on a pair of two-run homers, but the relief trio of Cameron Weston, Reese Sharp, and Randy Beriguete combined to pitch the final six innings without allowing a hit. </p>\n<p>Box Score</p>\nSunday’s Scheduled Games\n\nNorfolk @ Memphis, 3:05.

The entire school day everyone was just watching the tvs in the classroom. I remember the look on the girl I had a crush on’s face at one point. I remember a teacher, dont even remember what she taught, being choked up and saying “all I want to do right now is go home and hug my daughter.”</p>\n<p>The next year we had a thing where we honored some of the vitims and I picked a little girl that was killed on Flight 77.

She was 8 in 2001, her family was flying to a vacation.</p>\n<p>This day in baseball:https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/September_11</p>\n<p>2001 - All major league baseball games are canceled due to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, Flight #93, and the Pentagon. Games will not resume until September 17th. The Blue Jays take a 12-hour bus ride from Baltimore back to Toronto, and Yankee Stadium is evacuated as a precautionary measure. Former minor league players Marty Boryczewski, Mark Hindy, Mike Weinberg, and Brent Woodall are killed in the attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Squeaky floors were the best home security in 17th century Japan.</p>\n<p>You’d expect Japanese feudal lords to live in pristine houses with the sturdiest materials – and that is mostly true, save for their squeaky, creaky floors. Nightingale floors were flooring systems that “chirped” when somebody walked on it. They were installed in temples and palaces to alert of intruders. The floors were built in a way that the flooring nails rub against jackets or clamps, causing squeaking noises.Insects are attracted to light because of the moon.</p>\n<p>Bug behavior can be especially strange, but scientists predict that night insects (like moths) are attracted to lights because they used the light of the moon to navigate the Earth way before artificial lights were made.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Vice President Harris expressed concern over threats to voting rights and democracy in an interview with NBC’s \"Meet the Press\" aired on Sunday, during which she emphasized the importance of getting out the vote for the midterm elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Everything is on the line in these elections in just less than two months,” she said while discussing voting rights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris stressed that the issue is high on the Biden administration’s agenda and that the president will “not let the filibuster get in the way” of signing bills into law that make it easier to vote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Because what is happening in our country … they are passing laws making it more difficult for people to vote,” said Harris.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris specified President Biden’s support for the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. Both bills have been approved by the House but blocked in the Senate by Republican filibusters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vice president said that after Biden was elected in 2020 “you almost saw, almost immediately, so-called extremist leaders around the country starting to pass laws making it more difficult for people to vote.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think that scared some people that the American people were voting in such large numbers,” she said, referencing the record voter turnout that year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris also addressed election deniers running for secretary of state around the country and some lawmakers' refusal to condemn the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, voicing concern over how the country is handling \"attacks from within.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked by anchor Chuck Todd whether current internal threats to American democracy are “equal or greater than what we faced after 9/11,” Harris said that the two are “different.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Each are dangerous and extremely harmful, but they're different,” said Harris.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She continued: “When I think about what we have been seeing in terms of the attacks from within, I wish that we would approach it … as Americans, instead of through some partisan lens.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris claimed that threats to democracy from within the U.S. affect relations with other nations by indicating that America is not “valuing what they talk about.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I'm very concerned about it. Because there are so many issues going on in the world that I think require, at least how we as Americans have traditionally thought about what is right, what is good, what should be fought for, what should be human ideals, and certainly the ideals of democracies,” said Harris.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And I think that through the process of what we've been through, we're starting to allow people to call into question our commitment to those principles.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Todd also asked the vice president how she might deal with disputes about the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, saying, \"Have you thought about how you might handle a certification that did not reflect the outcome of the popular vote in the state?\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I haven't gotten to that point yet,\" Harris told him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I have to believe that the United States Congress and all the people who have taken an oath to defend our democracy will ensure and will stand up against anyone who tries to destroy or circumvent the rules and the practices and procedures that we've had in place that have allowed a peaceful transfer of power since the inception of our nation and the founding of our nation,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Todd also broached the topic of a potential prosecution of former President Trump, who is currently facing multiple investigations, to which Harris responded that she \"wouldn't dare tell the Department of Justice what to do.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris appeared to push back against the argument, raised by Todd, that it would be “too divisive for the country to prosecute a former president,” however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said that “the unthinkable has happened” before in U.S. history in situations “where there has been a call for justice, and justice has been served.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And I think that's potentially going to always be the case in our country that people are going to demand justice and they rightly do,” she said.</p>",

        "description": "<p>(NEXSTAR) – Beer tourism. It’s a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beer enthusiasts across the world are likely familiar with the concept of a “beercation,” or an excursion planned with the intention (at least in part) of visiting the local breweries or taprooms. Interest in “beercations” has actually become so prevalent, in fact, that Travelocity debuted a “Beer Tourism Index” in 2019 after a survey of just over 1,000 users found that over three-quarters showed interest in booking a trip that included local beer tastings or brewery tours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognizing this growing trend, the analysts at HomeToGo — a vacation rental platform — sought to determine America’s best “beer towns” using a \"Beer Lovers Index\" based on the number of brewpubs, breweries and top-rated bars, as well as the average prices of beer and the median cost of nightly accommodations for travelers hoping to spend a few nights in the city.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCheers! These are America’s 10 most popular beers\t\n\n\n\n\n<p>After researching hundreds of cities, HomeToGo settled on a ranking of the top 17 destinations for beer buffs looking for a quick, boozy getaway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Topping HomeToGo’s rankings is Chicago, Illinois, a city which scored high for its abundance of breweries and well-reviewed bars, as well as the affordability of pints and overnight stays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The brewery scene has taken off over the past few decades with Goose Island Beer Company opening in 1988,” writes HomeToGo, which noted that Chicago boasts 50 breweries. “Other local brewers like Two Brothers, Half Acre Beer Company, and Metropolitan Brewing have also become tremendously popular over the years.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rounding out the top five were Portland, Oregon, which boasts 52 breweries; Milwaukee, which earned a perfect score for affordable accommodations; Denver, which hosts the annual Great American Beer Festival; and Seattle, whose oldest brewery dates back to 1854, HomeToGo noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full list of the best “beer towns,” according to HomeToGo, are ranked as follows:</p>\n\n\n\nChicagoPortland, OregonMilwaukeeDenverSeattleNew York CityAsheville, North CarolinaAustinTampaMyrtle Beach, South CarolinaSan DiegoDaytona Beach, FloridaCharleston, South CarolinaBirmingham, AlabamaPortland, MaineBostonKey West, Florida\n\n\n\n<p>In researching each city, HomeToGo utilized data from the Brewers Association.

        "description": "<p>Boosted by endorsements from former President Trump, MAGA Republicans won many primaries in the spring and summer. For the general election, some of them have doubled down on their extremist pronouncements. Some have tried to walk them back and conceal evidence they ever made them. Most are doing all of the above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extremists and hypocrites, these candidates have handed Democrats plenty of material for a compelling campaign narrative that can energize their party’s base, while attracting independents and moderate Republicans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To date, the MAGA gifts keep on giving:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kari Lake, the Republican candidate for governor of Arizona, continues to insist that the 2020 presidential election was “corrupt and stolen.” Lake suggested the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects owners of rocket launchers. She has told women, “God did not create us to be equal to men.” She declared that the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago demonstrated that “our government is rotten to the core.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, although she supported the Texas law that bans all abortions except those that save the life of the mother before she was nominated, Lake has now endorsed the current Arizona law allowing abortions for the first 15 weeks of a pregnancy, which she says she “didn’t know was on the books.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of the Arizona primary for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, Blake Masters’ campaign website asserted, “if we had a free and fair election, President Trump would be sitting in the Oval Office today.” These days, the website says only, “We need to get serious about election integrity.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the spring, Masters supported a constitutional amendment that affirms “unborn babies are human beings that may not be killed.” These days, references to a “federal personhood law” have been scrubbed from his website, which now indicates that that he favors programs “that make it easier for pregnant women to support a family and decide to choose life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An extremist even among extremists, Doug Mastriano, the Republican candidate for governor of Pennsylvania, remains a fervent election denier. He also believes the separation of church and state is a myth; same sex marriage should “absolutely not” be legal; abortion should be banned from conception, with no exceptions; mask mandates are “child abuse” and that the Islamic faith is not compatible with the U.S. Constitution. In April 2022, Mastriano attended a convention hosted by two QAnon activists, which began with a video claiming that George H.W. Bush and Angela Merkel were part of a “Nazi succession,” controlled by a satanic cult engaged in “ritual child sacrifice.” Until recently, he appeared frequently on Gab, a white nationalist platform that has been condemned as a “cesspool of bigotry and antisemitism.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mastriano’s campaign also paid “consulting” fees to Gab. Its founder and CEO, Andrew Torba, boasted that neither he nor Mastriano conduct interviews with reporters from news outlets that are not Christian. “This is an explicitly Christian movement because this is an explicitly Christian country,” Torba asserted. In a video, Torba said, “We’re not bending to the knee of the 2 percent anymore,” an apparent reference to Jews. “We’re taking back our country. We’re taking back our government. So, deal with it.” Mastriano publicly praised Torba for “giving us a platform for free speech… Thank God for what you’ve done.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to the ensuing firestorm, Mastriano released a statement indicating that he rejects anti-Semitism “in any form” and that Torba “doesn’t speak for me or my campaign.” He did not repudiate Torba or Gab. Instead, Mastriano blamed the controversy on the media and Democrats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mastriano’s deletions — more than a dozen Facebook videos and 50 tweets with QAnon hashtags he has shared — have not kept up with his extremist pronouncements. But since the primary, he seldom mentions abortion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate primary, Donald Trump was ubiquitous in the ads and Twitter account of Dr. Mehmet Oz. Since Oz has become the Republican nominee, he rarely mentions Trump. “He has removed Trump’s endorsement from his site,” a student at Bloomsburg University, who attended the former president’s rally in Wilkes Barre, told a reporter. “So, I’m iffy on him.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Georgia, Herschel Walker has a different problem. Walker’s uninformed and incoherent comments about major political issues cast doubt on his qualifications to represent Georgia in the U.S. Senate. Following the mass shooting in a public school in Uvalde, Texas, Walker advocated “a department that can look at young men that’s looking at women that’s looking at social media.” He declared that the climate change provisions of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act don’t help Americans because “a lot of money is going to trees, and we have enough trees.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Walker has also practiced a political version of the hidden ball trick. He deleted from his website false claims that he graduated from the University of Georgia. Before the primary, Walker demanded that “Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin vote again” for president and claimed the Jan. 6 rioters were actors. After he was nominated, Walker was asked if he believed the 2020 presidential election was stolen. “I don’t know whether President Trump said that,” he replied. “He never said that to me.” When the Fox News reporter indicated that Trump “says it over and over,” Walker shot back, “No, no, no, no. I’ve never heard President Trump ever say that … I think something happened. I don’t know what it was — but something happened because people are angry.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This survey by no means exhausts the list of MAGA extremists who now are scrambling to convince voters they are in the political mainstream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In March, Scott Jensen, Minnesota’s Republican gubernatorial nominee, said he did not support exceptions for rape and incest in anti-abortion laws. He has now reversed himself, explaining that his previous comments were “clumsy.” And in an ad that appeared last week, Jensen holds a baby and says: “abortion is a protected, constitutional right, and no governor can change that, and I’m not running to do that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan Cox, Maryland’s GOP gubernatorial candidate, called on Trump in late 2020 to “seize federal voting machines [there are no “federal” voting machines] in states where fraud was overwhelmingly rampant.” He believes the search of Mar-a-Lago was “nothing short of communist Stasi police state tactics.” If elected, Cox promises to use the Maryland State Police and National Guard to “stand against all rogue actions of this out of control and tyrannical Biden administration.” Characterized as a “QAnon whackjob” by Larry Hogan, Maryland’s popular Republican governor, Cox has deleted more than 1,000 posts from his social media accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although with these extremist Republican candidates, substantive legislative accomplishments during the summer, and the Supreme Court decision overthrowing Roe v. Wade have improved Democrats’ prospects in November, they remain underdogs. The party that controls the White House rarely does well in midterm elections, and a majority of Americans do not approve of Biden’s performance in office and are deeply concerned about inflation and a potential recession. The outcome of races in battleground states will depend on turnout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the intensification of threats to our democracy, legitimized by the former president and some Republican politicians, a lot is at stake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glenn C.

        "description": "<p>Vice President Harris said in an interview broadcast on Sunday that she would again run on President Biden’s ticket in 2024 if he decides to seek reelection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The president has been very clear that he intends to run again,” Harris told host Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And if he does, I will be running with him proudly,” Harris added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden and his aides have insisted the president plans to run for reelection if his health allows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But some Democrats have dodged questions about whether they would support another White House bid by Biden, the oldest president in U.S. history, who also faces low approval ratings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His approval rating, however, has made gains in recent days following a string of recent legislative victories for Democrats and easing inflation, although it still remains underwater.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris also told Todd she was “very proud” to serve as Biden’s vice president.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We talk about family a lot,” she said. “We talk about our hopes, we talk about our dreams, we talk about the things that concern us, that worry us, the things that keep us excited about everything we are doing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It's a real friendship. We have a real friendship, and I cherish that,” Harris added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Biden decides to run for a second term, his candidacy could lead to a rematch of the 2020 contest against former President Trump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former president has remained active in Republican politics since departing the White House, in particular focusing on endorsing candidates in the midterm elections who support his unfounded claims of mass election fraud. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has said he already made a decision on whether he would mount a third White House bid, but he has not yet made a formal announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Yahoo-News-YouGov poll released last week found that Biden had a 6-point lead in a hypothetical rematch between the two presidents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forty-eight percent of registered voters said they’d vote for Biden, compared to 42 percent who said they’d vote for Trump. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The poll also found that an increasing percentage of Democrats want Biden to run in 2024, now outpacing those who say he shouldn't run. The pollster last month found a plurality of Democrats did not want Biden to seek reelection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A separate USA Today-Ipsos poll last month found that more than half of Democratic voters — 56 percent — indicated they did not want Biden to run for a second term.</p>",

        "description": "<p>We accept as self-evident that each of us is free to think and form our own opinions, that we have autonomous selves. Western societies and institutions are founded on this spirit of individual freedom and self-determination. But it is becoming clear that this very core of Western democratic culture is being undermined—be it by Russia’s cyber interference in elections or the widespread dissemination of fake news on social media. Many people assumed that they were at least in control of decisions over their own bodies, until the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade in June. Next up might be the reversal of the legalization of same-sex marriage and even a return to the criminalization of consensual gay sex.</p><p>All of these assaults on autonomy make it even more important to understand the beginnings of the modern self, the origins of that hard-won freedom. I spent the past several years looking for where this idea—taken for granted today, but once quite radical—first emerged and was surprised to discover that it was in a quiet university town called Jena, some 150 miles southwest of Berlin. It was there that, in the 1790s, a small group of rebellious playwrights, poets, and writers revolutionized the way we think of ourselves and the world.</p><p>I call them the “Jena Set,” and they are the subject of my new book, Magnificent Rebels.  Among them were some of Germany’s most brilliant minds—the poets Novalis and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; the playwright Friedrich Schiller; the philosophers Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Schelling, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel; the young scientist Alexander von Humboldt; the combative Schlegel brothers; the formidable Caroline Böhmer-Schlegel-Schelling. These thinkers began to seriously consider a number of existential questions: How do we have control over our own lives? Can we trust the knowledge produced by our minds? And perhaps most importantly, what does it mean to be free?</p><p>What happened in Jena in the 1790s that brought these questions to the fore? And why Jena? Why Germany? At the end of the 18th century, Germany wasn’t yet a unified nation; rather, it was a patchwork of more than 1,500 states—constituting the Holy Roman Empire—ranging from tiny principalities to powerful dynasties such as the Hohenzollern in Prussia and the Habsburgs in Austria. One unintended advantage of such fragmentation was that censorship was far more difficult to enforce than it was in large, centrally ruled nations such as France and England. Every German state, no matter how small, had its own set of regulations and laws. Germany was small, splintered, and inward-looking. And Germans seemed particularly enamored of the written word. The publishing trade was four to five times larger than that in England. Germans were voracious readers—and books, newspapers, pamphlets, and articles spread new ideas across the population.</p><p>Jena was only a small town of 4,500 inhabitants, but it was home to an important university. Because of complicated inheritance rules, the institution was nominally controlled by at least four Saxon dukes. In reality, no one was truly in charge. As a result, a broad scope of subjects could be taught. “The professors in Jena are almost entirely independent,” Schiller wrote. There was no university like it in Europe. Drawn by this openness, thinkers who had been in trouble with the authorities in their home states came to Jena. The last decade of the 18th century seemed to find more famous poets, writers, and philosophers living in Jena’s small confines, in proportion to its population, than in any town before or since—the makings of an intellectual hothouse.</p><p>[Read: When philosophy becomes therapy]</p><p>Picture the largest auditorium in Jena in the summer of 1794. It was noisy with the sound of several hundred students fighting for seats. They spilled out into the corridors, clambered onto benches in the back; some even climbed onto ladders at the windows to listen to their new professor, Fichte. The air was stale and hot. Fichte stood at the lectern in riding boots with spurs, holding his whip. More bull than racehorse, he was of average height but muscular, with a forceful presence. There was nothing gentle about him. He thundered, insulted, and shouted. He stomped rather than walked, every step an affirmation of his very existence. He ate his snuff tobacco rather than inhaling it.</p><p>Philosophy was not just the domain of philosophy students, he insisted, but of society at large. “I am a priest of truth,” Fichte shouted from his lectern. Confident and self-assured, he wanted nothing less than to teach the world how to think. There were no God-given or absolute truths, Fichte said; the only certainty was that the world was experienced by the self—by the Ich, as the Germans say. The Ich, he explained, “posits its own being”—in other words, the self brings itself into existence. Not only that, but through this powerful initial act, it also conjures up the so-called non-Ich—the external world that includes nature, animals, other people, and so on. Fichte didn’t say that the self creates (or controls) the world but rather that it creates our knowledge of the world.</p><p>In the mid-17th century, the French philosopher René Descartes shifted emphasis to the self when he famously asserted, “Cogito, ergo sum”—“I think, therefore I am.” But he had been troubled by how the immaterial mind could be joined to a material body. His philosophy was one of dualism, of a division between mind and matter. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant had also given the mind a more important role. He asserted that we are essentially citizens of two worlds, occupying both the internal world of our own perception (the “thing-as-it-appears-to-us”) and the external world (his “thing-in-itself”). Kant explained that we will never truly understand the thing-in-itself, because we’ll always comprehend the external world through our senses and the categories of our mind, such as time, space, and causality.  They are like tinted spectacles through which we understand the external world.</p><p>Fichte’s starting point for everything was the self, but not Kant’s twofold view of the thing-in-itself and the thing-as-it-appears-to-us. He criticized Kant for not having overcome Descartes’ dualism, in which the external world exists independently of the mind. Not only did Fichte overcome this divided world (when he asserted that our knowledge of the external world was produced by our self) but his Ich was powerful: If the Ich brings itself into existence, it must be free. The Ich, not God or monarchs, was the first principle of everything. At a time when most German rulers demanded complete subordination from their subjects, Fichte gave the self the most exciting of all powers: free will.</p><p>This was an idea lit by the fire of the French Revolution—an event so pivotal that no one in Europe was unaffected. When the French revolutionaries declared all men equal, they promised a new social order founded on freedom and the power of ideas. Philosophy left the ivory tower and provoked ordinary people to action. Words and ideas could change the world more fundamentally than could weapons and monarchs. “Things are becoming reality,” the poet Novalis wrote in 1794, “which, ten years ago, would have gone straight to the philosophical madhouse.”</p><p>Fichte’s idea of the Ich as the first principle of everything was as revolutionary as any of the political changes witnessed in France. “My system is, from beginning to end, an analysis of the concept of freedom,” Fichte declared—and this radically new concept of a free self carried the potential for a different life. A person “should be what he is,” Fichte told his students in Jena, “because he wants to be it and is right to want to be it.” His own life was proof of the power of his philosophy. Born the son of a poor ribbon weaver in a small village in Saxony, Fichte became the most famous German philosopher of his time, after Kant. He used his mind—his will—to abandon a seemingly predestined path.</p><p>Fichte electrified his students and his contemporaries—they called him the “Bonaparte of Philosophy.” More than half of Jena’s 800 students came to his lectures, and many declared him their idol. For the 24-year-old poet Friedrich Hölderlin, the philosopher was the “soul of Jena.” For Hegel, he was a “Titan fighting for humanity.” Schiller and Goethe went to Fichte’s lectures, and Schelling believed Fichte’s ideas to be a “revolution brought about by philosophy.”</p><p>But there were also critical voices. Fathers feared Fichte’s influence on their impressionable sons; other observers worried about what they called the “lawless capriciousness of the current zeitgeist.” This new addiction to the Ich, they said, would inevitably lead to egotistical self-absorption. Meanwhile, the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder accused Fichte of “disgustingly playing with himself—a masturbation of pure-impure reason.” But whatever people said, it soon became obvious that students and thinkers were not philosophizing anymore, but “fichticizing.” The self had become the starting point of everything.</p><p>Jena and its most famous residents—Fichte, Goethe, and Schiller—seemed to exert a magnetic pull. Soon, a new generation of young thinkers arrived in the small university town, including Friedrich and August Wilhelm Schlegel, two brothers who fought the literary establishment. Turning against the polished refinement and rigid metric patterns of earlier 18th-century poetry, they were the first to use the term romantic in its new literary meaning. “We have to believe in the power of words,” Friedrich Schlegel declared. Within the next few years, they founded their own magazine and launched Romanticism onto the international stage. Their lives became the laboratories for Fichte’s Ich-philosophy: They defied social conventions, and the emphasis on individual experience became their guiding light.</p><p>Friedrich Schlegel lived with his lover, the divorced writer Dorothea Veit, in his brother’s house in Jena. He called himself a “Dictator-Critic,” a literary critic with a pen as sharp as the French guillotines. He took the obsession with the self to another level when he wrote Lucinde, an erotic autobiographical novel in which he invited readers into his bedroom to watch him and Dorothea make love.</p><p>[Read: What we gain from a good-enough life]</p><p>Meanwhile, August Wilhelm Schlegel and his wife, Caroline, had come to the highly unusual arrangement of an open marriage—“an alliance that between ourselves we never regarded as anything but utterly free,” she explained. Before marrying August Wilhelm, Caroline had been imprisoned for being a sympathizer of the French Revolution and had found herself pregnant by a young French soldier, possibly after a one-night stand at a ball. But why, she asked, should her life be destroyed by “one little foolishness” that would have meant nothing had she been a man? She was educated, beautiful, witty, and self-confident. She assumed the role of editor for the Schlegel brothers’ literary magazine, wrote reviews under her husband’s name, translated with him 16 Shakespeare plays (which still make up the standard edition in Germany today), and gave the Jena Set a place where they could think, talk, laugh, and write. And though she didn’t contribute theoretical treatises or essays, she lived and breathed this new Ich-philosophy. She was the embodiment of the empowered free self.</p><p>The Jena Set felt invincible. They were embroiled in endless fights with the literary establishments and later with each other. They walked a fine line between free will and selfishness, self-determination and narcissism—a balancing act that seems all too familiar today. Maybe it’s not that surprising to find inflated egos, infighting, and self-absorption in a group of strong-willed men and women who believed in the supreme rule of the self. Freedom brings with it both responsibilities and dangers. The friends in Jena struggled with that, just as we do today. From the moment this seismic shift toward an empowered self rippled out of Jena, people have had to deal with the perils. But Fichte himself never intended his ideas to be a celebration of narcissism. On the contrary, he always insisted that our freedom is tightly bound to our moral obligations. “Only those are free,” he told students during his first lecture series, in 1794, “who will try to make everyone around them free.” Freedom always brings its twin: moral duty. How can we live a fulfilled life in which we follow our dreams while also being a morally good person? How do we reconcile personal liberty with the demands of society? Are we too selfish? Are we treading on someone else’s liberty?</p><p>The self, for better or worse, has remained center stage ever since Fichte put it there. The French revolutionaries changed the political landscape of Europe, but Fichte and the friends in Jena incited a revolution of the mind. We may have forgotten Fichte, and we might not talk about his self-determined Ich any more, but we have internalized it. We are this Ich. We’re still empowered by the Jena Set’s daring leap, by the absolute importance they placed on personal freedom. And at a time when we find our democracies hollowed out and threatened by liars, despots, and reactionary politicians, it is up to us to determine how much we want to fight for this legacy.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Hillary Clinton on Sunday said there are “lessons still to be learned” from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, noting the country’s unity following the terrorist attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have also, I think, been reminded about how important it is to try to deal with extremism of any kind, especially when it uses violence to try to achieve political and ideological goals,” Clinton said during an interview with co-anchor Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union” on the 21st anniversary of the attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So I'm one who thinks that there are lessons still to be learned from what happened to us on 9/11 that we should be very aware of, during this time in our country and the world’s history.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Biden, Vice President Harris and other senior officials traveled to remembrance ceremonies at the World Trade Center and Pentagon on Sunday morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clinton at the time of the attacks served as a U.S. senator from New York and years later served as secretary of State during the Obama administration, managing the country’s foreign policy during U.S. interventions in the Middle East spurred by the attacks.The ex-first lady reflected on the country's response to the attacks on CNN, lauding former President George W. Bush's commitment to helping rebuild New York after the collapse of the Twin Towers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I feel grateful that we were able to come together as a country at that really terrible time,” Clinton said. “We put aside differences. I wish we could find ways of doing that again.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added that she hopes the country could unite again, touting Biden’s legislative record on issues like climate change, health care and gun violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are in a funny position, Dana, because there's a small but very vocal, very powerful, very determined minority who wants to impose their views on all the rest of us,” Clinton told Bash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And it's time for everybody regardless of party to say, no, that's not who we are as America,” Clinton added.</p>",

        "description": "Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>The starting pitchers for Mississippi and Augusta shined on Saturday evening.</p> <p>It was a fun night down in the Atlanta Braves’ farm system as their farm affiliates went a combined 2-1 with Rome getting a game cancelled due to rain. Darius Vines and JR Ritchie were both excellent on the mound, the Augusta offense went wild, and Mississippi...tried their very best. Let’s get into the games.</p>\n<p></p>\nGwinnett Stripers 4, Buffalo Bisons 1\n<p>Box Score</p>\n\nRyan Casteel, C: 1-3, HR, 2 RBI, BB, .808 OPS\nHernan Perez, RF: 2-4, BB, R, .752 OPS\nDarius Vines, SP: 5 IP, 5 H, 1 ER, 2 BB, 3 K, 2.91 ERA\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The Stripers took advantage of a strong start from Darius Vines and managed to stitch together enough offense to secure a 4-1 victory on Saturday evening. Vines was coming off a stretch where he hadn’t completed the fifth inning or more since 8/14, so it was nice to see him pitch deep enough to “qualify for the win”. We still have not seen him miss bats like he was at Mississippi, but we have noticed some lack of sharpness on his offspeed stuff as well as his command backing up a little bit which both could be attributed to late season fatigue. The Gwinnett bullpen got the job done as Ferguson, Webb, Cruz, and Tonkin combined for four hitless innings of relief with seven strikeouts (although the five walks between them were less than ideal).</p>\n<p>The biggest swing of the night came from Ryan Casteel who connected for a two-run homer in the sixth inning. That was his 16th homer this season and raised his season OPS .808 despite his less than great .214 batting average. Hernan Perez was the only Striper to have a multi-hit game, although Taylor Motter, Rylan Bannon, and Delino DeShields joined him and Casteel as players that reached base multiple times. </p>\n<p></p>\nMississippi Braves 1, Biloxi Shuckers 9\n<p>Box Score</p>\n\nJalen Miller, DH: 1-4, 2B, RBI, .740 OPS\nJustyn-Henry Malloy, LF: 1-3, BB, R, .862 OPS\nNolan Kingham, SP: 5 IP, 9 H, 5 ER, 0 BB, 5 K, 6.43 ERA\n\n<p></p>\n<p>We won’t linger longer here as Nolan Kingham had given up five runs by the end of the third inning and the Mississippi offense went cold as the Braves fell by the score of 9-1. Nolan Kingham got the start for Mississippi and he continued his 2022 struggles that ended up getting him demoted back to Mississippi in the first place. He has thrown 15 innings total in his last three starts and has given up 14 runs while walking five and striking out 12 batters. There is certainly some unfortunate BABIP stuff happening with him, but the four homers he has given up over that same span plus the usual eye test stuff seems to indicate he isn’t fooling guys as a starter. We liked how his stuff played up as a reliever and we hope he ends up back in that role to set him up better for success.</p>\n<p>On offense, yeah...it was a tough night. Mississippi only managed to get four hits in the game with the only extra-base knock coming via a double for Jalen Miller. Justyn-Henry Malloy wasn’t going to be denied as he reached base twice. Malloy is doing in September pretty much what he did during his particular hot month of August with the notable exception of not hitting for power at the moment as he has just one extra-base hit this month. We are talking about a small sample here in an environment that is known to suppress power, but this is at least something to keep an eye on.</p>\n<p></p>\nRome Braves, Hickory Crawdads - Cancelled\n<p>Rain sucks</p>\n<p></p>\nAugusta GreenJackets 9, Kannapolis Cannon Ballers 1\n<p>Box Score</p>\n\nEthan Workinger, 1B: 2-5, 3B, 2 RBI, R, .855 OPS\nNacho Alvarez, 3B: 2-4, BB, SB, 3 R, ,883 OPS\nStephen Paolini, RF: 1-2, 2B, 2 BB, HBP, .662 OPS\nJR Ritchie, SP: 4 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 0 BB, 6 K, 2.70 ERA\n\n<p></p>\n<p>JR Ritchie continues to improve and impress in his first season as a pro and the Augusta offense went wild on their way to a 9-1 win. After not having his best command last week, Ritchie got back on track on Saturday as he gave up zero free passes and made it through four innings on 49 pitches while striking out six batters. So far as a pro, the Braves’ 35th pick in the 2022 draft has averaged about a strikeout an inning while walking just five batters (three of which came last week). The Augusta bullpen took the ball and ran with it as they combined for five shutout innings with one walk and eight strikeouts.</p>\n<p>On offense, it was a team effort as every hitter in the lineup other than Francisco Floyd recorded a hit in the game and Francisco did reach via a walk and score a run. Nacho Alvarez, Drake Baldwin, Ethan Workinger, and EJ Exposito each had multi-hit games with others reaching multiple times with the help of some walks and, in Stephen Paolini’s case, HBP. Workinger, in particular, has been quite hot in September as he has slashed .308/.345/.615 in seven games this month.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Enlarge (credit: Ars Technica)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It's time for another Dealmaster. Our latest roundup of the best tech deals from around the web includes a limited-time promotion on HBO Max subscriptions. As of this writing, new and returning customers to the video streaming service can take 30 percent off a one-year subscription when they pay for the 12 months in advance. This brings the ad-free version of the service down from $150 to $105 (or just under $9 a month) and the ad-supported tier down from $100 to $70 (or just under $6 a month). The promotion technically went live a few weeks ago, but HBO Max says the deal will be available through October 30.</p>\n<p>To put the offer into context, new HBO Max owner Warner Bros. Discovery recently started culling content from the service as part of a major cost-cutting drive, even going so far as to cancel high-profile features like Batgirl before their scheduled release. Last month, the company also announced plans to merge HBO Max with the Discovery+ streaming service by the summer of 2023, though it hasn't clarified what that service will cost or how the merger will affect existing subscribers. The promotion here, then, looks to be a way to stem subscriber losses and lock in more customers for the year ahead.</p>\n<p>That said, this is still a fairly sizable discount. And even after shedding dozens of titles, HBO Max still has plenty of worthwhile binge fodder, including Ars-approved series like Hacks, His Dark Materials, and The White Lotus, newer well-reviewed titles like The Rehearsal and Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon, and well-known fare like The Sopranos, Sex and the City, and Curb Your Enthusiasm. If you aren't fatigued by the glut of streaming services asking for your attention these days, or if you've been looking to give the service a try anyway, this is a decent deal. Just note that the offer can not be used to extend an existing membership.</p><p>Read 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

        "description": "<p>The fourth novel by the chatshow host is a darkly comic Irish domestic drama that has emotional depth but is undemanding</p><p>When Graham Norton surprised the literary world with his adept fiction debut, Holding, adroitly adapted into a Kathy Burke-directed television series earlier this year, the amiable narrative spun around a body uncovered in a sleepy Irish hamlet and the secrets the community held close to their hearts. Six years and three novels later, there’s again a gruesome discovery in a domestic basement and a litany of rumours and family upheavals in a quiet Irish town to unpick. Formulaic? Let’s just say Norton is really good at undemanding, popular fiction with emotional weight and something to say about the vagaries of contemporary life.</p><p>Actually, he promises that Forever Home is both the “funniest and darkest” story he’s written thus far. Whether he gets that balance right is a moot point. At its heart is Carol, a quietly heroic late-fortysomething divorcee who finds love again with the much-older Declan. He’s seemingly revelling in a second chance at a relationship, too, given the wife of his two adult children mysteriously disappeared years ago. Naturally, all cannot be well. Declan is soon moved into a nursing home, his untrusting and clearly messed-up children booting Carol out of their house so they can secure a quick advance on their inheritance.</p><p>Forever Home by Graham Norton is published by Coronet (£20).

        "description": "Nathan Ray Seebeck-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>With Marwin Gonzalez two positions away from playing everywhere this season, let’s look at some other Yankee who had stints all over the diamond.</p> <p>In the eighth inning of last Friday’s 9-0 loss to the Rays at the Trop, the Yankees turned to a position-player pitcher for the first time this season and sent in Marwin Gonzalez to pitch. The veteran got the final out of the inning from the only batter he faced, Harold Ramírez.</p>\n<p>Beyond the general notability of a position player pitching, Gonzalez’s stint on the mound also added something notable to his season. Including the couple times he’s technically been the Yankees’ DH when coming in as a pinch-runner, Gonzalez has now played all but two positions possible for the Yankees this season: catcher and center field. For his career, he’s never played behind the plate and has just three innings in center, so it’s unlikely that he’ll check off the full set, unless things get really weird in one game.</p>\n<p>If Gonzalez somehow does end up at one of those positions, he would become a first in Yankees history. No player in franchise history has played at all nine positions in the field, plus DH. Even if you take out the DH part, no Yankee has played at all nine fielding positions so far. However, there are a number of Yankees who have played all over the diamond over their careers in pinstripes. Let’s take a look at those guys.</p>\n<p>Eight different Yankees played at least once at all seven of the non-pitcher/catcher positions. That group ranges from a Hall of Famer in Mickey Mantle (a minor-league shortstop who cameoed all around the infield on random whims from Casey Stengel), all the way down to Bill Stumpf, he of a 47 OPS+ in 1912-13.</p>\n<p>There’s only two from the group of eight who also then got appearances at DH: Randy Velarde and Clay Bellinger. Despite Bellinger playing just 181 games overs parts of three seasons with the Yankees, he racked up at least 18 innings at the seven non-pitching/catching fielding position, and at least 48 if you factor out right field.</p>\n  \n        \n      SetNumber: X63685 TK1 R7 F11\n      Clay Bellinger\n  \n<p>Going off his whole career, Hal Chase played every single position on the field except catcher, but on the Yankees specifically, he fell one position short of that feat. The legendary, um, “character” was known as an excellent defensive first baseman, but he traveled all around the diamond over his career in New York from 1905-13. Although he didn’t get a game in right field while a Yankee/Highlander, he did play every other non-catcher spot, including facing a single batter on the mound in 1908.</p>\n<p>As one might expect, catcher is the big outlier position. Especially in recent years, the utility guys who play lots of positions occasionally get sent to the mound to eat up an inning or two in a blowout. However, catching is a specialized skill. While the Yankees have been willing to do it this season, teams sometimes won’t pinch-hit or replace their catcher mid-game, not wanting to risk an injury and having to use an emergency player at that position.</p>\n<p>As a result, there aren’t a ton of players who caught and also ventured all the way around the diamond. Sure, there are some backstops who aw games at first base and maybe another spot, but not many who caught and then played a bunch of infield spots and also the outfield. One notable exception is Jim Leyritz. While he didn’t play the two other most notable defensive positions (shortstop and center field), he did everything else except pitch, including play DH, manning 7 of 10 spots over the course of his Yankee career. One occasion in 1990 led to disaster for poor Andy Hawkins.</p>\n\n<p>The most fun combination might belong to another catcher: Rick Cerone. Over the course of his Yankee career, Cerone got games at first, second, and third bases in addition to his normal spot behind the plate. Plus in two different games in the 1987 season, he was sent in to pitch. Going off the position numbers, over his two stints as a Yankee, Cerone played the 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 spots.</p>\n<p>There are a couple players from history who have played all nine positions in one game before, but no Yankee has come close to that yet. Although maybe for the hell of it, they should let Marwin try.</p>\n<p>All data courtesy of Baseball Reference Stathead</p>",

It is now seeking to cut about 4,000 jobs in an effort to boost capital reserves and profitability.

She actually asked a lot of questions about our domestic politics,” she added. “And she was unbelievably informed and always gracious and warm.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Britain's longest-serving monarch died on Thursday at the age of 96. There were 14 different U.S. presidents and 15 British prime ministers during Elizabeth's 70-year reign.</p>",

And those twin themes of loss and renewal, I think, go backwards and forwards in people's minds.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pierce, who has served as ambassador to the U.S. since March 2020, previously served the U.K. as its ambassador to the United Nations and Afghanistan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also said the queen was “incredibly interested” in American politics and believed strongly in the strong U.K.-U.S. ties, often described as a special relationship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She read the embassy’s cables, she would talk to me about American politics,” Pierce said. “And that's an incredible thing to be able to chat with the queen, who has seen it all, about what's happening.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about what the queen meant for women and girls in Britain, Pierce called Elizabeth the “ultimate role model,” adding that the queen was honored to receive a women in leadership award named after Ruth Bader Ginsburg late last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There might be lots of men between you and the queen,” Pierce said on CNN. “But at the end of the day, there was the queen, which was fantastic.”</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/3636322-rocket-lab-to-conduct-first-private-mission-to-venus/",
        "description": "<p>One benefit of the commercial space launch revolution has been the lower cost of planetary missions. Launch systems such as the SpaceX Falcon 9 have enabled public-private partnerships such as the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program in which NASA has partnered with small businesses to launch probes to the lunar surface as part of the Artemis moon-exploration program. The costs of these missions are a fraction of the past NASA-only missions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, Rocket Lab, a launch company that is rapidly becoming a competitor to SpaceX, is taking cheap robotic space exploration one step further. The joint American-New Zealand company is sending a probe to search for life in the upper atmosphere of Venus, the second planet from the sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Venus would seem to be a strange target for a search for extraterrestrial life. Its surface is a hell of crushing CO2 and sulfuric acid with an atmospheric pressure 90 times that of the Earth’s surface and a temperature of roughly 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists believe that Venus was once a world much like Earth but, because of natural processes, underwent a runaway greenhouse effect that made the planet what it is today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Venus, 50 kilometers above the hellish surface, above the sulfuric acid clouds, the planet is a relatively benign place. The temperature and atmospheric pressure are very close to Earth normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, scientists thought they had detected phosphine in the upper atmosphere of Venus. Phosphine is a gas that is only created in nature by microbes. The discovery sparked speculation that microbes trapped in droplets of water are floating 50 kilometers above the surface of Venus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other scientists have since disputed the discovery. Nevertheless, Rocket Lab is sending a privately financed probe that will dip into the Venusian atmosphere to find out for sure. The probe, called the Venus Life Finder (VLF), would be launched on a Rocket Lab Electron, according to Ars Technica, in May 2023. The Electron’s Photon upper stage would raise the VLF probe’s orbit until it achieves escape velocity. Some months later, in October 2023, the VLF would plunge into Venus’ atmosphere and spend three minutes looking for life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The VLF represents the second development that promises to revolutionize planetary exploration. The probe, developed by scientists at MIT, weighs just 50 pounds. When it plunges into Venus’ atmosphere it will use an instrument called the “autofluorescing nephelometer” that will use a laser to illuminate organic molecules that may or may not exist 50 kilometers above the planet’s surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the VLF probe finds signs of life in the upper atmosphere of Venus, the discovery will be a historic event. Scientists have been trying to find microbial life on Mars for decades. Extraterrestrial life may reside in warm oceans beneath the ice layers of Jupiter’s moon Europa or Saturn’s moon Enceladus. Venus might be the last place that anyone expected to find the first lifeform to have evolved on — or above — another world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if the VLF does not find life in the upper atmosphere of Venus, just putting the probe where it needs to be to look for it will open all sorts of possibilities for Rocket Lab and any other company that cares to take advantage of them. Tiny, light-weight robotic probes combined with cheap launch systems could usher in a new era of solar system exploration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when the launch system is monstrously expensive, tiny space probes can take advantage of ridesharing opportunities. The Artemis 1 mission, currently stuck on the launch pad, contains 10 such cube satellite probes, called “CubeSats,” that will be deployed along with the uncrewed Orion spacecraft once the expensive and complex Space Launch System gets off the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CLPS program is another example of small, privately developed space probes using modern, inexpensive launch vehicles, in this case to explore the lunar surface in advance of the first Artemis missions. The Intuitive Machines Nova-C and the Astrobotic Peregrine are due to launch to the moon in December 2022. NASA is partly financing these missions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rocket Lab, which has already launched numerous satellites to low-Earth orbit, has also boosted the CAPSTONE CubeSat to a lunar orbit. However, the success or failure of the Venus Life Finder mission will likely determine that company’s role in exploring the solar system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark R. Whittington is the author of space exploration studies “Why is It So Hard to Go Back to the Moon?” as well as “The Moon, Mars and Beyond” and “Why is America Going Back to the Moon?” He blogs at Curmudgeons Corner.</p>",

        "description": "Robert Kalich at his writing desk at his penthouse apartment on Central Park South. Photograph by Daniel Krieger.\n<p>by Daniel Krieger</p>\n<p>Many years ago, at the age of 33, Robert Kalich hit a bad losing streak. He was dead broke. He was in debt $40,000 from gambling. He was stuck in a toxic marriage to a woman he couldn’t get along with but couldn’t keep his hands off of. Nothing was working out. And it was the one and only time in his entire life that he moved away from the Upper West Side to the Upper East Side, which he hated. Then his wife threw him out and he moved in with his parents on West End Avenue. Heartbroken, he decided he was going to show her he could make it.</p>\n<p>“I was a degenerate until I was 33,” he says, matter-of-factly, during a recent interview. But 33 was a turning point. That was when he figured out how to break the losing streak thanks, Kalich says, to his burning ambition, a deep understanding of basketball and his facility with numbers.</p>\n<p>Leaning back in a carved wooden chair in his rent-stabilized Central Park South penthouse, where he’s lived since 1972, Kalich talks openly about his charmed and exuberant life. He is now 85, with a paunch and a full head of slightly disheveled white hair. He’s wearing a Georgia Tech T-shirt, Adidas sweatpants and black sneakers. The north-facing window of his 21st-floor apartment has a sweeping view of Central Park. Each room, the kitchen included, is lined with books, about 10,000 in total, all literature, from all over the world. Most of the furniture in the densely-packed (but very orderly) four-room space is built by the master craftsman Richard Rothbard.</p>\n<p>Blunt, brash, sarcastic, plainspoken, playful and impatient with my ignorance, Kalich sounds like an old school ‘New Yawka’ dropping his r’s and taking little time for niceties. He’s what my mother, who grew up in Queens, would’ve called, “a real charactah.”</p>\nA display case on the terrace that shows some of Kalich’s books, including his two other auto-fiction novels — “The Handicapper” and “David Lazar,” which along with his new novel, “Impossible to be Human,” will be published next month as a trilogy. Photograph by Daniel Krieger.\n<p>What else is Robert Kalich? He is a novelist whose fourth novel, a fictionalized memoir called “Impossible to be Human,” comes out in October, completing his auto-fiction trilogy that concludes the story of “The Handicapper” (1981) and “David Lazar” (2019). He is also a non-fiction writer of a half dozen books. He is a professional gambler — more specifically, a “handicapper.” And it was his genius at gambling that turned things around when he hit rock bottom. By studying and analyzing college basketball in order to gain an edge, which is what a handicapper does, he cracked the code and began winning at gambling, creating a lucrative industrial-size operation, he says.</p>\n<p>“I’ve had a big life,” he says, surveying his eight decades on earth. “And I never had a small ego. I wanted to own the city. I was as big as you get and I knew everybody.”</p>\n<p>His friends in the 1960’s, 70’s and 80’s spanned a who’s who of luminaries in theater, film, government, sports, finance, real estate – you name it. He used to host summer parties with 150 guests on his 3,000-square-foot terrace; guests included the likes of Robert De Niro, Ed Koch, Barbra Streisand, Dick Barnett, Al Pacino, La Toya Jackson, Earl Monroe.</p>\n<p>Kalich grew up on 106th Street and West End Avenue. His dad, Kalman Kalich, was a renowned cantor at the Ohab Zedek Synagogue on West 95th Street, but Kalich thought religion was “inane” and his dad an “ignoramus” who never got a proper education.</p>\n<p>His mother was a professor of psychology at Barnard College, and it was she who raised Kalich and his identical twin brother, Richard, to be worldly men of letters in a household chock-full of culture. Kalich says he always wanted to be a novelist and from childhood read voraciously. “When I read Dostoyevsky,” he says, “I thought I could be Dostoyevsky.”</p>\n<p>The Jewish enclave on the Upper West Side was a great place for a kid to grow up in the 1940s and 50s, he says, calling it “much more humane, not like today with the digital culture where you have nothing but alienation and spiritual impoverishment.”</p>\n<p>After graduating from NYU, in 1960 he got a job at The Daily Mirror, a tabloid published by William Randolph Hearst. He started as a copy boy and moved up to obit writer. Then he covered nightlife, like Tony Curtis in the film, “The Sweet Smell of Success.” “I was Broadway Bob,” he says, “and I was getting to know the most gorgeous girls in the city. I loved that job.” But he quit shortly before the paper went under in 1963 and became a social worker in Harlem due to the demands of his first wife who wanted him to earn more money.</p>\n<p>On two subjects, Kalich shows some modesty. The first is his twin brother, Richard, who is also a novelist and lives down the street. They talk several times a day and are, as Kalich puts it, two sides of the same coin — the same yet different. “All I can tell you about my fucking eccentric, neurotic, completely crazy brother is that there’s never a day I’m with him when I don’t learn something,” Kalich says. “He is the consummate intellectual. I’m not an intellectual like him. He is totally pure. Without any corruption. I’ve had nothing but corruption in my life since the age of 33.”</p>\n<p>The second subject that he speaks of with modesty is his sixth wife, Brunde Broady, a philanthropist, businesswoman and writer who spends most of her time at their estate in North Salem, NY, in Westchester, where Kalich goes on weekends. They have a son, Knute, who studies at Georgia Tech.  “When I met my wife, I was ready to settle down and live a domesticated life, to a certain extent,” he says. “The best 25 years of my life have been the past 25 years with her.”</p>\nThe view of Central Park from Kalich’s writing desk. Photograph by Daniel Krieger.\n<p>Looking back on his eventful journey through life with its ups and downs, good fortune, twists and triumphs, Kalich is quite pleased with how things turned out. Standing on his terrace under the late summer sun, surrounded by abundant lush greenery and with the sprawling expanse of Central Park in the background, he turns to me and says: “I’ve had a great life, and you know what? I’d like to do it all over again.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>3:26PM: LeMahieu discussed his toe injury with Rivera and other reporters, saying that he had yet to begin any baseball activities since he isn’t able to rotate his right foot.  LeMahieu is hopeful he might be able to return when the Yankees begin a homestand on September 20, though Boone wasn’t quite as optimistic about that potential return date.</p>\n<p>9:25AM: The Yankees were largely able to avoid the injury bug in the early part of the year but it’s caught up with them here in the latter part of the schedule. The club currently has 15 players on the IL, which includes five position players and 10 pitchers. Marly Rivera did a thorough roundup at ESPN, including comments from manager Aaron Boone.</p>\n<p>First baseman Anthony Rizzo has been out of action for over a week now but seems to be trending towards a return to baseball activities. A lingering back issue led to him getting an epidural as treatment, but that had the unfortunate side effect of giving Rizzo migraines. Rivera reports that Rizzo received a blood patch to try to alleviate the migraines, which Boone characterized as a success. “Immediately, they had him moving around and walking,” Boone said. “And I think it freed him up right away. Headaches are gone so far.”</p>\n<p>Boone then added that if Rizzo feels good today, they will start ramping up baseball activities. While that sounds like good news, the next steps are still a bit murky. Though Boone is hoping for Rizzo to be back in the lineup within a week, it will depend on how things progress. “It’ll kind of depend on how the ramp-up goes. Hopefully, we’ve gotten through what we need to, and now we can start building that process. We’ll just pay attention to how he’s doing and how long it takes him to get rolling.”</p>\n<p>With Rizzo and DJ LeMahieu out of action, the Yanks took a shot on Ronald Guzmán, though he was designated for assignment after just a few days. Marwin Gonzalez is holding down the position for now, with Rivera reporting that rookie Oswaldo Cabrera currently penciled in as the backup. Cabrera definitely has versatility, having played a lot of second base, third base and shortstop in his career, as well as some outfield work. He’s never played first base, however, though that doesn’t seem too concerning to the Yanks. Rivera reports that Cabrera has been practicing his work at first, getting a nod of approval from infield coach Travis Chapman.</p>\n<p>There could be reinforcements coming for the outfield as well, with Harrison Bader inching closer to his Yankee debut. Acquired from the Cardinals on deadline day, Bader was on the IL at the time with plantar fasciitis and hasn’t been able to officially don the pinstripes just yet. He is going to start a rehab assignment today, though only serving as designated hitter initially. “It’s really just a matter of getting on a baseball field, checking off boxes in terms of feeling comfortable physically at game speed, and once those are checked, I’m going to go and be a winning player for this team,” Bader said.</p>\n<p>Giving more details about the rehab, Boone said that Bader will DH today for the Double-A Somerset Patriots, who then have an off-day on Monday, with Bader building up after that. “It’ll probably be at least a week,” Boone said. “If we get through that week, and the buildup is going fine, he could be in play then when we start the homestand.” The homestand Boone referred to begins on September 20, which would give Bader a chance to contribute over the final two weeks of the regular schedule.</p>\n<p>As for the pitching staff, the Yanks could have many options over the horizon, as a whole fleet of arms are rehabbing and nearing a return. Aroldis Chapman, Miguel Castro and Zack Britton are all scheduled to pitch for the Patriots today, with Chapman and Castro potentially returning for the same homestand as Bader. Scott Effross isn’t quite at the rehab stage but is gearing up to it. Additionally, Luis Severino is ready for launch but will make one more rehab start since the big league club has a couple of off-days that negate the need for his services in the short term.</p>\n<p>The health of all these players, and the roster in general, will be hugely important for the Yankees in the final few weeks of the season. Not so long ago, it seemed that they were in cruise control, leading the AL East by as much as 15 1/2 games in July. This pile of injuries has helped slow the team down and whittle their lead over the Rays to just 4 1/2 games as of today, with the Jays just half a game behind Tampa. With just over three weeks left in the regular season, the Yanks will be hoping to fend off their competitors and keep the division title, which would be hugely important for their postseason chances. Whoever wins the East will almost certainly get a bye through the first round, whereas those who settle for a Wild Card slot will have to survive a best-of-three series to stay alive.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Tim Hardaway took the stage and told a story of his early days in the NBA, when Golden State teammates Mitch Richmond and Chris Mullin would often ask him the same question.</p><p>“They would ask me, ‘Tim, how great do you want to be?’” Hardaway said.</p><p>They have their answer. So does everyone else. He’s a basketball immortal.</p><p>Hardaway, Manu Ginobili, Swin Cash, Bob Huggins, Del Harris, Lindsay Whalen, Marianne Stanley, Theresa Shank Grentz and George Karl all delivered their enshrinement addresses as new members of the Basketball Hall of Fame on Saturday night in Springfield, Massachusetts.</p><p>“A kid from the east side of Chicago made it all the way to Springfield, Massachusetts,” Hardaway said. “Incredible.”</p><p>Such was the theme throughout the night: how an honor that none of the new Hall members imagined has now come their way, each of them thanking those who helped them reached the pinnacle.</p><p>Ginobili was presented by Tim Duncan, already a Hall of Famer himself, and next year the third member of San Antonio’s legendary Big 3 of players — Tony Parker — will be eligible for selection.</p><p>“The Spurs were one big, strong, supportive family for me,\" Ginobili said.</p><p>Someday, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich will be in the Hall as well; the NBA's all-time wins leader doesn't want to be considered until his career is over. Ginobili reserved special tribute for him.</p><p>“Pop, what can I say? You've been so, so important for me and my family, on and off the court, that'll I never be able to thank you enough,\" Ginobili said, his voice cracking.</p><p>Cash — an NCAA, WNBA and Olympic champion — also paid tribute to her coach at UConn, Hall of Famer Geno Auriemma and her Huskies teammates, including the group that went 39-0 for her senior season in 2001-02.</p><p>“If anyone's debating the greatest basketball team ever, ask about us,\" said Cash, who now works in the front office of the New Orleans Pelicans.</p><p>Duncan and Ginobili weren’t the only teammates in the building. Stanley and Shank Grentz were teammates at Immaculata in the 1970s, before going on to coaching careers — and now, the Hall, together.</p><p>“It's the privilege of a lifetime,\" Stanley said.</p><p>Added Shank Grentz, who, like all inductees, learned of her selection in April: “I am still overwhelmed.\"</p><p>Whalen, whose legendary playing career has been followed by her returning to alma mater Minnesota and coaching there, might have had a Hall of Fame first by thanking a fast-food company.</p><p>“Thank you, Burger King,” Whalen said.</p><p>To explain: When Whalen — a converted hockey player — was going to her first basketball camp, she was anxious, crying, not wanting to go into the gym. But her parents had paid for camp and weren't going to let her back out, so negotiations quickly took place. The agreement was eventually struck; if Whalen would go to camp, she’d get a Whopper Jr., with cheese, for the ride home.</p><p>“I ended up having a great time,” Whalen said.</p><p>Her parents not wanting her to play hockey was her twist of fate. For Harris, his was a professor encouraging him to take a year to coach a junior-high basketball team before joining the seminary.</p><p>Harris was going to be a pastor; ironically, basketball’s founder, Dr. James Naismith, also was a pastor. Instead, Harris followed in another set of Naismith’s footsteps, as a coach.</p><p>“After that year, I knew what I wanted to do with my life,” said Harris, who coached at just about every imaginable level — high school, college, the NBA, international teams and at the FIBA level.</p><p>His path to the Hall came from modest beginnings, just like Huggins — who now coaches at his alma mater, West Virginia and has won more than 900 games in his collegiate career — and Karl, who got emotional when he paid tribute to his college coach at North Carolina, Dean Smith, and got laughs when talking about the challenge of coaching a Hall of Famer like Gary Payton.</p><p>“This is really incredible for a guy from Penn Hills, Pennsylvania,\" Karl said. “This is a ‘wow' moment for me.\"</p><p>Huggins even did a little coaching as he paid tribute during his speech to Jerry Colangelo, the chairman of the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame.</p><p>“You’re allowed to clap, I think,” Huggins said. “I’m not real sure of the rules, but what the hell, let’s just make them as we go.”</p><p>Hardaway, Richmond and Mullin formed the trio known as “Run TMC,” which remains popular today. Mullin entered the Hall in 2011, Richmond three years later. And they were on the stage Saturday night, seated just to Hardaway’s left, when his wait finally ended.</p><p>“Legendary, baby,” Hardaway said. “We was legendary.”</p><p>Also honored were seven more new Hall members, all deceased: one of NBA’s first Black referees in Hugh Evans, six-time All-Star Lou Hudson, former coach Larry Costello, international great Radivoj Korac and a trio of former Harlem Globetrotters in Wyatt “Sonny” Boswell, Inman Jackson and Albert “Runt” Pullins.</p><p>And special tribute was paid to two-time Hall of Fame inductee Bill Russell, who made it in as a player, then as a coach. Russell died earlier this year, and the ceremony Saturday began with Hall of Famers Jerry West and Alonzo Mourning paying respect to the 11-time champion.</p><p>“Bill was the ultimate competitor on the court and a remarkable human being off of it,” West said. “And in his own way, he made all the lives he touched a little better. That’s why he’ll be missed, especially by those who were fortunate enough to know him.”</p><p>Added Mourning, who spoke of Russell’s work as a champion of social justice: “Rest in power, my friend.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>Sadler’s Wells, LondonA crusader and a Saracen have a fateful encounter in this richly layered work by Shobana Jeyasingh Dance, set to Monteverdi and a plangent score by Syrian-American composer Kareem Roustom</p><p>Each man kills the thing he loves, though rarely on the battlefield. Shobana Jeyasingh’s richly layered new dance work draws on a 16th-century epic poem in which the crusader Tancredi kills a valiant Saracen only to discover it’s Clorinda, the woman he loves.Monteverdi’s scena about this episode is a 20-minute wonder. First staged in a Venetian palazzo in 1624, its driving rhythms represent a musical leap forward – pizzicato conjures metallic sword blows, agitated strings spit sparks for the heat of combat. And Robert Hollingworth’s musicians are suitably bristling.Darting and lunging through Merle Hensel’s set of slender glass pillars, Jemima Brown makes Clorinda unpredictable, while Jonathan Goddard’s Tancredi is almost foppishly correct, fencing rather than slashing. These exceptional dancers create an electric charge – they leap, kick, roll into exhaustion. With a courtly flourish, Tancredi requests Clorinda’s name; she withholds it, thrusting an elbow to his sternum. Enraged, he delivers the fatal blow with a hug.Who frames Clorinda’s story? In Monteverdi, a narrator has the lion’s share, and Jeyasingh pushes this further, having tenor Ed Lyon also singing the combatants’ lines. Fervent, fatigued, sorrowing, he voices the encounter’s shifting atmospheres. He crouches like a war reporter as the warriors wrestle and swerve – but is Clorinda’s ecstatic last-breath conversion to Christianity the tale she’d choose to tell?</p><p>In a less taut second section, scored by Syrian-American composer Kareem Roustom, four women become avatars of a current Clorinda, scurrying at speed for safety. Unforgiving projections show a devastating, unnamed middle-eastern conflict. The pillars, previously banded with Lee Curran’s rich emerald light, turn dark or fill with scarlet. This is how a crusade looks to those caught up in it, less glamorously chivalric than in Monteverdi’s work.A plangent recorded mezzo sings in Arabic. Goddard and Lyon reappear as a cameraman and sound operator, advancing dispassionately as the women swirl and fall. They too resist being known, arms held over faces, heads turned aside. A line of unknowability, they stride forward in profile, advancing in emphatic jumps. The strings glide, woozy with fatigue, but the women continue. A fable about conversion now concludes in defiance.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Sunday described the Queen Elizabeth II she knew, calling her “an engaging and lively conversationalist.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The queen died last week at the age of 96.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of her on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Clinton added: “She asked great questions. She was interested in what was going on in the United States, elsewhere in the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clinton also said she appreciated the queen’s warmth and sense of humor and fondly recalled time spent on a royal yacht with her during commemorations for the 50th anniversary of D-Day in 1994. Clinton’s husband, Bill Clinton, was one of 13 presidents with whom the queen met during her long reign, starting with President Harry S. Truman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former first lady also said that she admired the queen’s dedication to her obligations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I admired her devotion to duty and her sense of obligation to the people of her nation,” she said, “and she was never wavering from what she said when she first became a very young queen.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Host Dana Bash asked Clinton if the two had ever discussed what it was like to be a female leader in a world full of so many male presidents and prime ministers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I can’t say that I talked at any length,” she said. “Sometimes there would be, you know, a wry exchange about how, as a woman leader, you always had to have your hair done. Of course, she always looked perfect, unlike some of us. She had a sense of style that really stayed with her.”</p>",

Valera went 3-for-5 with a three-run homer and two singles.</p>\nTriple-A Oklahoma City\n<p>Oklahoma City is doing their best to fall out of the top spot in the PCL East. The Dodgers scored two late runs to make it close but they fell 4-3 to Tacoma (Mariners).</p>\n<p>The eighth loss in their last 10 games, combined with a win for both El Paso (Padres) and Round Rock (Rangers), drops OKC out of first and into a tie for second place with Round Rock.</p>\n<p>After trading runs in the first inning, OKC found themselves down 4-1 heading into the bottom of the seventh. Michael Busch singled home a run in the seventh and Jason Martin did the same in the eighth. But they would go in order in the ninth to take the loss.</p>\n<p>Busch finished his night 3-for-5 with the RBI-single, while Edwin Ríos singled in the run for the Dodgers in the first, going 2-for-4 out of the cleanup spot.</p>\n<p>Tommy Kahnle tossed another inning in the boxscore but he didn’t record all three outs in the same inning.

It was different but they still lost 5-4 to West Michigan (Tigers) in extra innings.</p>\n<p>Aldrich De Jongh made sure the Loons scored by hitting a solo homer in the second inning.

It was mostly Lake Elsinore from that point on as the Quakes allowed 13 runs when they resumed Saturday, sending Rancho to a 15-12 loss.</p>\n<p>The two clubs combined for seven home runs and several lead changes along the way. Kyle Froemke and Dalton Rushing hit their home runs Friday night to help the Quakes to a four-run lead.

        "description": "Kamil Krzaczynski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Stroman’s rough second inning leads to a 5-2 loss</p> <p>Saturday, what most of us have known or at least suspected most or all year long. The Cubs cannot and will not finish with a winning record. They lost their 81st game Saturday. With 23 games left, it’s reasonable to guess that 92 losses are very much in play (11-12 the remainder of the way) and that 95 losses (9-14 or worse) is a very real possibility. </p>\n<p>It looked for a while like this team had turned a corner. But the losses are once again mounting. On August 20, the Cubs had reached 52-67, just 15 games under .500. The Cubs are 6-14 in the 20 games since then. Once again, they seem just overmatched all too often. Even in some games on this homestand against teams like the Reds and Giants who are also just playing out the string. In other games, they had some production in one phase of the game only to be let down in other phases. </p>\n<p>Saturday, the bullpen was pretty decent. Three Cubs pitchers combined to allow one run on four hits and a walk over five innings. You never want your bullpen to have to throw five innings, but if they do, you have to take that result. We’re generally very happy as fans of starters if the allow one run every three innings. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the offense was inept. Just seven hits and one walk isn’t going to win a ton of games. Thanks to a pair of doubles and a triple, they did manage two runs, but again, that’s not the kind of output that wins a ton of games. And that is especially true when the starter allows four runs in just four innings of work. It all adds up to not good enough. </p>\n<p>On the positive side, we start with Ian Happ. Ian had a pair of doubles and the only run driven in for the Cubs on the day. Al’s been covering the developing story that is the 38 doubles by Ian Happ this year. He’s on his way to a 40-plus double season. </p>\n<p>Alfonso Rivas also had a pair of hits. One of his was a triple, after which he scored a run. Even with the good night at the plate, he’s only got a wRC+ of 89. At a key offensive position like first, even with strong glove work, that’s just not good enough. </p>\n<p>When I’m highlighting a reliever, it’s usually going to be a perfect inning. But I can certainly make an exception when he needs only 10 batters to record nine outs. He also struck out three in three innings of work. </p>\n<p>Let’s turn our attention now to the Heroes and Goats from Saturday’s loss. </p>\n<p>Game 139, September 10: Giants 5 at Cubs 2 (58-81)</p>\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs\n  \n<p>Reminder: Heroes and Goats are determined by WPA scores and are in no way subjective.</p>\n<p>THREE HEROES:</p>\n\n\nSuperhero: Alfonso Rivas (.116). 2-4, 3B, R, K\n\nHero: Sean Newcomb (.109). 3IP (10 batters), H, 3K\n\nSidekick: Ian Happ (.101). 2-4, 2-2B, RBI, K\n\n<p>THREE GOATS:</p>\n\n\nBilly Goat: Marcus Stroman (-.236). 4IP (20 batters), 7H, BB, 4R, 4K, WP, BK (L 3-7)\n\nGoat: P.J. Higgins (-.162). 0-4, K\n\nKid: Seiya Suzuki (-.091). 0-4, K\n\n<p>WPA Play of the Game: The Giants were leading 2-1 in the second when Joey Bart took Marcus Stroman deep, giving the Giants all of the runs they needed. (.169)</p>\n<p>*Cubs Play of the Game: Ian Happ doubled with a runner on second with two outs in the first. The run scored and the Cubs had the game’s first run. (.102)</p>\n\n<p>Rizzo Award Cumulative Standings: (Top 5/Bottom 5)</p>\n<p>The award is named for Anthony Rizzo, who finished first in this category three of the first four years it was in existence and four times overall. He also recorded the highest season total ever at +65.5. The point scale is three points for a Superhero down to negative three points for a Billy Goat.</p>\n\nDavid Robertson +22.5\nNico Hoerner +17.5\nScott Effross +17\nChristopher Morel +14\nPatrick Wisdom +13.5\nDaniel Norris/Frank Schwindel -9.5\nRowan Wick -10.5\nYan Gomes -13\nJason Heyward/Rafael Ortega -15.5\n\n<p>Up Next: The third and final game of the series, the seventh and final game of the season between these two teams. The Giants have already won four and therefore the season series, but the Cubs can still win this series. Wade Miley (1-0, 3.13) will make his second start since coming off of the injured list. Of course, his last start was notable due to the relief work of Hayden Wesneski. That could be a side story in this one. The Giants will start John Brebbia (6-1, 2.93), who’s a reliever likely serving as an opener. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>On the anniversary of 9/11, the 21 years since the horrible attack on our nation reminds us that we still have a great deal of work to do, particularly to protect our country from global catastrophic threats. I was honored and privileged to serve President Bush and Homeland Security Advisor, Gov. Tom Ridge, in the post 9/11 White House, a dramatic and uncertain time to say the least. After Gov. Ridge left Pennsylvania to take leadership of Homeland Security at the White House, he and our team were greeted on Day One by a burgeoning anthrax attack. We had many more questions than answers and quickly realized that our global catastrophic risk capabilities were seriously flawed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, I served as a deputy assistant to the president for Homeland Security, and as part of my responsibility, I spent time in the situation room for a year being briefed every day on national security threats as they related to the homeland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My friends would often ask me what “scared” me the most, and I would always answer: biological threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these years later, the COVID-19 pandemic reminded all of us about the ramifications of our nation and the world still not being prepared to act decisively with a well-planned federal response to global catastrophic events. The human suffering and the staggering economic costs should be a clarion call for global catastrophic risk strategies to become an actionable, and properly funded, national priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the original blueprint for the creation of the Department of Homeland Security — and in the authorizing statute — was the establishment of the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA). The vision was for HSARPA to perform necessary research and transform that research into necessary solutions to our homeland security challenges, based on the model of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which has been critical to informing the best national security team in the world. DARPA is known for being visionary, first and foremost. It also is organized in a way that allows the team to have not only management roles, but also robust funding and flexibility in procurement to maximize their success. However, for a myriad of reasons, HSARPA has come nowhere close to emulating this model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many think tanks, legislators, and former DHS employees have commented that HSARPA has lacked a particular focus. While biodefense must involve HHS and DOD components, DHS needs to be a significant part of this threat matrix team, and HSARPA should be considered a leader and a critical link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With its recently released “First Annual Report on Progress towards implementation of the American Pandemics Preparedness Plan,” the Biden administration cites among its priorities an increased investment in research and development dollars for biodefense. Additionally, Congress is currently considering ways to sharpen the mission of the office for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction at DHS. But — to date — there has been a lack of focus on HSARPA and the challenges within the Science and Technology Directorate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, HSARPA should conduct a net mission assessment of HSARPA that evaluates the current threat landscape and provides direction, vision, and a new mission statement for HSARPA. Projects are funded but not in the context of meeting a specific strategy. Developing strategies for long-term professional management and procurement strategies, similar to DARPA, are also a key to future success. And of course, Congress will need to provide much more funding if we are to accomplish the goal that was intended by HSARPA by our DHS founders.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still consider DHS a new federal bureaucracy that needs to be able to adapt based on lessons learned. The concept of creating HSARPA was a good idea in 2001, but we need to do more as a country to make its goals a reality so that we can better protect the American people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark Holman, a partner at Ridge Policy Group, served as deputy assistant for homeland security to President George W. Bush after the 9/11 attacks.</p>",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/drew-pomeranz-likely-done-for-2022-season.html",
        "description": "<p>San Diego Padres reliever Drew Pomeranz’s 2022 season will almost certainly go down as a lost season, with Kevin Acee of the San Diego Union-Tribune (article link) reporting that the southpaw is continuing to experience discomfort in his left elbow. Acee adds that while a recent MRI shows no new structural damage, Padres manager Bob Melvin is pessimistic regarding the lefty’s chance of successfully rehabbing and making his 2022 debut.</p>\n<p>Since signing a four-year, $34 million contract with the Padres prior to the 2020 season, Pomeranz has been a steady fixture in the bullpen, posting a sub-2 ERA with a handful of saves over 44 1/3 innings during the 2020 and 2021 seasons. However, Pomeranz underwent flexor tendon surgery in August 2021, finishing the season with a 1.75 ERA in 27 appearances, and was expected to return to the mound late this season. Nevertheless, continued soreness during rehab has led to stalled progress.</p>\n<p>This is not the first time Pomeranz has lost most of a season to injury. He pitched only 74 innings (11 starts) in 2018 with bicep and forearm injuries. Additionally, in 2016 when the Padres traded Pomeranz to the Red Sox, Padres General Manager A.J. Preller was suspended 30 days for the improper handling of players’ medical files.</p>\n<p>As for the Padres, they are currently in the thick of the NL Wild Card race with a 77-63 record – half a game behind the Phillies and three games ahead of the Brewers. Their bullpen has been solid, ranking 13th in ERA with a collective 3.80 and 12th in WHIP with a collective 1.23. The team attempted to address their slightly above-average bullpen at the trade deadline, in a more under-the-radar move compared to the Juan Soto trade, with the swap of Taylor Rogers and Dinelson Lamet for three-time National League Relief Pitcher of the Year Josh Hader. However, Hader has floundered since arriving in San Diego, with the usually dominant reliever posting a 13.50 ERA and 2.423 WHIP in 8 2/3 innings after the trade, resulting in the removal from his traditional closing role.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Padres still have control of Pomeranz for one more season. If he has a healthy and productive Spring Training, it would not be surprising to see Preller extend the southpaw with the Padres farm system considerably thinned out in recent years.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Americans remembered 9/11 on Sunday with tear-choked tributes, and pleas to “never forget,\" 21 years after the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil.</p><p>Bonita Mentis set out to read victims' names at the ground zero ceremony wearing a necklace with a photo of her slain sister, Shevonne Mentis, a 25-year-old Guyanese immigrant who worked for a financial firm.</p><p>“It’s been 21 years, but it’s not 21 years for us. It seems like just yesterday,\" Mentis said. \"The wounds are still fresh.”</p><p>“No matter how many years have passed, nobody can actually comprehend that what happened that very day,” she added.</p><p>Victims’ relatives and dignitaries also convened at the other two attack sites, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania.</p><p>More than two decades later, Sept. 11 remains a point for reflection on the hijacked-plane attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people, reconfigured national security policy and spurred a U.S. “war on terror” worldwide. Sunday's observances, which follow a fraught milestone anniversary last year, come little more than a month after a U.S. drone strike killed a key al-Qaida figure who helped plot the 9/11 attacks, Ayman al-Zawahri.</p><p>Pierre Roldan, who lost his cousin Carlos Lillo, a paramedic, said “we had some form of justice” when a U.S. raid killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.</p><p>“Now that Al-Zawahri is gone, at least we’re continuing to get that justice,” Roldan said.</p><p>The Sept. 11 attacks also stirred — for a time — a sense of national pride and unity for many, while subjecting Muslim Americans to years of suspicion and bigotry and engendering debate over the balance between safety and civil liberties. In ways both subtle and plain, the aftermath of 9/11 ripples through American politics and public life to this day.</p><p>But like some other victims' relatives, Jay Saloman fears that Americans' consciousness of 9/11 is receding.</p><p>“It was a terrorist attack against our country that day. And theoretically, everybody should remember it and, you know, take precautions and watch out,\" said Saloman, who lost his brother.</p><p>Like a growing number of those who read names at ground zero, firefighter Jimmy Riches’ namesake nephew wasn’t born yet when his relative died. But the boy took the podium to honor him.</p><p>“You’re always in my heart. And I know you are watching over me,” he said after reading a portion of the victims’ names.</p><p>More than 70 of Sekou Siby's co-workers perished at Windows on the World, the restaurant atop the trade center's north tower. Siby had been scheduled to work that morning until another cook asked him to switch shifts.</p><p>The Ivorian immigrant wrestled with how to comprehend such horror in a country where he'd come looking for a better life. And he found it difficult to form friendships as close as those he'd had at Windows on the World. It was too painful, he'd learned, to become attached to people when “you have no control over what’s going to happen to them next.”</p><p>“Every 9/11 is a reminder of what I lost that I can never recover,” Siby said in the leadup to the anniversary. He's now president and CEO of ROC United, a restaurant workers' advocacy group that evolved from a post-9/11 relief center.</p><p>Speaking at the Pentagon on Sunday, President Joe Biden recalled seeing smoke rise from the stricken U.S. military headquarters on 9/11, when he was a senator.

        "description": "<p>Triston McKenzie turned in another postseason-worthy performance in another pivotal game for the Cleveland Guardians.</p><p>Whether or not this proves to be a tune-up for October, he sure was sharp.</p><p>McKenzie pitched seven shutout innings, Amed Rosario hit a two-run homer and the AL Central-leading Guardians held on to beat the Minnesota Twins 6-4 Saturday night.</p><p>“The vibe in the clubhouse right now is these are must-win games,” McKenzie said. “Second place in this division doesn’t make the playoffs, so I think that’s all that’s on our mind.”</p><p>José Ramírez went 3 for 4 with two runs, a walk and an RBI for Cleveland, which improved to 13-5 in its last 18 road games and stayed 1½ games ahead of Chicago in the three-team division race. Minnesota dropped 3½ games back and fell to .500 for the first time since April 24.</p><p>The Guardians, who are 8-5 against the Twins this year, would complete their second series sweep since the All-Star break with a win Sunday. They won all three games at Detroit on Aug. 9-11.</p><p>After turning a 7-0 deficit into a one-run loss Friday night, their rally finally halted in the eighth inning with the potential tying run on second base, the Twins again snapped to life late. They trailed 6-0 before a four-run ninth that got tense enough for All-Star closer Emmanuel Clase to be summoned for the final out.</p><p>After a sacrifice fly by Gio Urshela, an RBI double by Jake Cave and an RBI single by Luis Arraez — whose two earlier doubles were wasted — Carlos Correa greeted Clase by reaching on an infield single. The errant throw from Ramírez at third base allowed Arraez to score. But after one more hit, by Jose Miranda, Clase retired Max Kepler on a grounder for his 33rd save.</p><p>“We’ve got to figure out the end a little better. It’s getting a little hairy there,” Guardians manager Terry Francona said.</p><p>McKenzie (10-11) won for the first time in four starts, with six hits and two walks allowed and five strikeouts. The slender right-hander's breakthrough year has made him a strong candidate to complement two-time All-Star Shane Bieber in a playoff-series rotation if the Guardians can fend off the White Sox and injury-ravaged Twins, who have lost eight of 10.</p><p>“The big games is the key. I don’t care who you are, what your ERA is. If you’re a young guy or even a veteran, you pitch in a big game there’s some emotions that take over,” Guardians catcher Luke Maile said. “He came out and dominated.”</p><p>Even if the AL Central winner is on track for the worst record of the 12 qualifiers in Major League Baseball's expanded postseason field, the Guardians are carrying a confidence about them that belies their failure so far to pull away from the pack.</p><p>McKenzie had a spring in his step all night as he ended each inning on the mound. First baseman Josh Naylor and second baseman Andrés Giménez pumped their fists upon completion of a double play in the fifth on a grounder by Miranda after the Twins put runners at the corners.</p><p>Left fielder Will Benson leaped at the wall in the eighth for a highlight-reel catch on Kepler’s fly ball. In the third, Giménez, shifted into shallow right field, made a diving catch to steal a hit from Kepler to end that inning and strand runners at the corners.</p><p>“My immediate thought is, ‘Wow, that’s a hit, maybe a run,’ and then I look over and he’s midair making the catch,\" McKenzie said. \"I don’t think there’s a better feeling.”</p><p>The Twins have scored just 29 runs in nine games this month.</p><p>“We've got a good team,” Miranda said. “I'd still say we've got to take it day by day.”</p><p>Twins starter Chris Archer (2-8) lasted only two innings because of tightness in his right pectoral muscle, and the game spiraled out of control — literally — when Cole Sands relieved for the third. The rookie right-hander threw only 16 strikes in 39 pitches that inning, giving up two runs on four walks and two hit batters — without a hit.</p><p>“It’s pretty hard to come back and win those types of ballgames,” Minnesota manager Rocco Baldelli said.</p><p>The Twins are 1-10 in Archer's last 11 starts, a span in which he has a 6.35 ERA.</p><p>Up next</p><p>Guardians: Bieber (9-8, 2.96 ERA) will pitch Sunday afternoon. He's 5-2 with a 1.79 ERA over his last eight starts.</p><p>Twins: Rookie RHP Josh Winder (4-3, 3.77 ERA) is expected to be called up from Triple-A St. Paul to take the mound for the final game of the series.</p>",

        "description": "Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Aaron Judge’s 2022 campaign embodies everything that is great about modern baseball. </p> <p>“Genius is not replicable. Inspiration, though, is contagious, and multiform — and even just to see, close up, power and aggression made vulnerable to beauty is to feel inspired and (in a fleeting, mortal way) reconciled.” —David Foster Wallace, “Roger Federer As Religious Experience” (2006)</p>\n<p>Four months ago, I borrowed Wallace’s terminology to try to put into words just how spectacular Aaron Judge’s development has been over the course of his career. What could easily have been a career relegated to little more than Herculean power and gale force whiffs, based strictly on his intimidating physical presence and penchant to hit a ball further than most humans are capable of, turned instead into a genuinely excellent all-around ballplayer with a habit of producing jaw-dropping moments on both sides of the ball.</p>\n<p>Two months after that article went live, Judge’s bat went ballistic and made us realize that his pursuit of the American League home run record — a record that has stood for 61 years, conveniently enough — wasn’t going to be a fluke. His run inspired me to return to the religious metaphor I borrowed from Wallace in my original article, despite originally having had no intention to do so, to explore why I found Judge’s talent so hard to capture in words. Much like Federer’s brilliance, Judge’s talent is not something that you watch, it’s something that you experience. His game is filled with otherworldly, surreal, improbable moments, where you will likely see something that you didn’t realize was humanly possible. A religious experience, if you will.</p>\n<p>Now, some six weeks after publishing that essay, I’m back to talking about the religious experience of Aaron Judge and how his 2022 campaign has turned the modern game into a spectacle. </p>\n<p>In his original essay from 2006, Wallace writes:</p>\n<p>“In the same emphatic, empirical, dominating way that Lendl drove home his own lesson, Roger Federer is showing that the speed and strength of today’s pro game are merely its skeleton, not its flesh. He has, figuratively and literally, re-embodied men’s tennis, and for the first time in years the game’s future is unpredictable.”</p>\n<p>This is precisely what Aaron Judge has done this season. In a three-true-outcome era of the game, where sluggers and teams alike are often content with high strikeout rates so long as they coincide with high on-base percentages and high power output, Judge has found a way to not only dominate that style of play, but to also transcend the perceived limitations of it, both technically and stylistically. </p>\n<p>Entering the final stretch of what has been a remarkable season, Judge finds himself in prime position to be discussed amongst the most dominating seasons of all-time when all is said and done. Here are some of the statistics* that make that statement true: his 55 home runs lead the entire league, with Kyle Schwarber’s 37 a distant second place; his 120 runs batted in also lead the entire league, with Paul Goldschmidt, a likely MVP in his own right, 11 behind; his .410 on-base percentage trails Goldschmidt’s by a margin of just a single point for the league lead; and his .683 slugging percentage is 76 points higher than the next highest in the league. And that’s not even mentioning the advance stats, where he is well on his way to a 204 wRC+ season that would put him in truly elite company and where his 9.3 fWAR (through the start of play on Saturday) blows the competition out of the water.</p>\n<p>But stating these facts without the context of these numbers doesn’t do Judge’s season justice. When I wrote the first two essays in this series, the Yankees were the best team in baseball by a fairly significant margin, thanks in large part to Judge’s first half. From Opening Day until July 31, when I published the second piece in this series, Judge slashed .297/.383/.671 with 42 home runs and a 194 wRC+. And somehow, despite the Yankees’ second-half collapse, he has actually played better since then. From the beginning of August until the first game in the Tampa Bay Rays series, he has slashed .325/.487/.718 with 13 home runs and a 231 wRC+, despite the fact that the vast majority of the lineup around him has either been injured or entirely ineffective. He’s also done this while swiping bases at a career high clip, playing outstanding defense, chasing a home run record, and, now, hunting down a potential triple crown. </p>\n<p>Technical discussions of the game aside, though, Judge has also managed to overcome the stylistic limitations of the modern game that some fans, both traditional and analytically-inclined alike, struggle to reconcile. Three-true-outcome baseball has become a painstaking topic of conversation amongst fans in recent years, as some blame high strikeout rates and a lack of the ever-elusive “situational hitting” for the slide in popularity that baseball is experiencing while others extol the benefits of trading strikeouts for guys who hit the snot out of the baseball. Though I, admittedly, fall in the latter camp, even I have to admit that, at times, this type of strategy isn’t the most aesthetically pleasing on-field product.</p>\n<p>But then there’s Judge, who has found a way to translate his game of high strikeouts — when Saturday began, he found himself 21st in the majors with a 25.5 percent strikeout rate — physics-defying strength, and a preternatural ability to work a walk into spectacle. Since the middle of April, every Aaron Judge at-bat has been must-see television, even when the Yankees were beating up on their opponents at a historic rate or, later, when they found themselves collapsing at a historic rate. It’s become commonplace to wait with bated breath for Judge’s spot in the lineup to come up, no matter the game situation, and you can almost feel a palpable energy through the television when his 6-foot-7, 282-pound frame steps up to the plate, as if something magical is guaranteed to happen.</p>\n\n<p>I genuinely cannot remember the last time a spectacle of this nature existed in Yankee Stadium, the hallowed grounds of arguably the most storied sport in North America.</p>\n<p>I’m way over my word count, unfortunately, but I want to return to Wallace’s words just once more. Genius of Aaron Judge’s caliber is simply not replicable. He has turned himself into a one-of-one talent, a one-man wrecking crew capable of feats I didn’t think that I would ever see again in my lifetime, who knows the game on such an intricate level that his utter domination of it becomes so much more than simple entertainment. To watch Aaron Judge step up to the plate in 2022 is to see, up close, the game of baseball reconciling with itself and, in turn, the best player in the game re-define our experience of it. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.) said on Sunday that a congressional briefing to get a damage assessment of the classified documents potentially mishandled by former President Trump is on hold since a judge allowed a special master to review what was seized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My understanding is there is some question because of the special master appointment by the judge in Florida whether they can brief at this point,” Warner told CBS “Face the Nation” moderator Margaret Brennan. “We need clarification on that from that judge as quickly as possible because it is essential that the intelligence community, leadership at least, get a briefing of the damage assessment.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warner, along with the committee’s vice chairman, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), have requested more information on the classified documents obtained during an FBI search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property in August, seeking both the documents seized and an assessment of any national security threats posed by potential mishandling of the information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon granted Trump's request last week to appoint an independent special master to review materials seized by the FBI after he raised concerns that some of the information obtained as part of the Justice Department's investigation into the former president was protected under attorney-client and executive privileges. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warner said the congressional request in no way sought to hinder the DOJ's ongoing investigation and sidestepped questions by Brennan about information shared with Congress being more likely to leak to the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I believe that it’s our congressional duty to have that oversight,” Warner said. “Remember what’s at stake here is the fact that if some of these documents involved human intelligence and that information got out, people will die,” noting that years of work could be “destroyed.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Senate Intelligence Committee, which Warner called the “last functioning bipartisan committee, I believe, in the whole Congress” had an obligation to review any potential security dangers to the country and its intelligence gathering capabilities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I do want the damage assessment of what would happen to our ability to protect the nation,” Warner said, adding that the request by the intelligence leaders sought to “assess whether there’s been damage done to our intelligence collection and maintenance of secrets capacity.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Updated 11:32 a.m.</p>",

A debt that can never be repaid, but we’ll never fail to meet the sacred obligation to you.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also referenced the killings of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011 and his successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, at the end of July, saying the United States \"will not rest.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Al-Zawahiri’s killing came almost a year after the United States withdrew its military presence in Afghanistan as the Taliban retook control of the country. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden has touted the operation as proof the United States can still fight terrorism in Afghanistan without troops on the ground, a sentiment he echoed on Sunday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We'll continue to monitor and disrupt those terrorist activities wherever we find them, wherever they exist, and we will never hesitate to do what's necessary to defend the American people,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The president also leveraged the anniversary to speak about democracy, a topic he has increasingly referenced as the midterm elections approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have an obligation, a duty, a responsibility to defend, preserve and protect our democracy,” Biden said. “The very democracy that guarantees the rights of freedom that those terrorists on 9/11 sought to bury in the burning fire, smoke and ash.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden has cast former President Trump and “MAGA Republicans” as threats to the republic in recent speeches. But on Sunday, he vowed to maintain America’s democratic system while not directly attacking Trump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It's not enough to stand up for democracy once a year or every now and then,” Biden said. “It's something we have to do every single day. So this is a day not only to remember, but a day of renewal and resolve for each and every American.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>--Updated at 11:11 a.m.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/3636356-ending-telehealth-cuts-off-a-vital-tool-against-opioid-addiction/",
        "description": "<p>The opioid crisis is a national tragedy. In the last 12 months, over 108,000 Americans were lost to drug overdoses, the most on record, with over three-quarters of those untimely deaths involving opioids. Shockingly, illicit drugs are now the number one killer of Americans between ages 18 and 45 — more than firearms, car accidents and COVID-19 — and a major contributing factor to a sharp decline in U.S. life expectancy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As bad as the crisis has been, it has the potential to grow even worse as several important tools in the fight against drug addiction and abuse are set to expire in the coming months. Among these is the expansion of telemedicine to treat those suffering from opioid use disorder (OUD).   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) loosened restrictions to allow DEA-registered practitioners to issue medication-assisted treatment (MAT) to patients without first conducting an in-person evaluation. These drugs, including buprenorphine and methadone, are considered the “gold standard” in treating OUD, with far better outcomes than other treatment options. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The government initially granted this exemption to promote social distancing and ensure continuity of care during the unprecedented COVID-19 health emergency, but it had the added advantage of reducing the stigma and other barriers to obtaining in-person treatment, especially for vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations that often lack access to quality healthcare.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the impact of this change is difficult to quantify, it has undoubtedly saved lives. Indeed, recent studies have shown patients taking buprenorphine are over 60 percent less likely to suffer a fatal overdose than those not taking medication for OUD, and that prescribing buprenorphine via telemedicine is at least as effective, and sometimes more effective, at keeping patients in treatment.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, the telemedicine exemption will lapse at the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration, currently set to expire on October 2022, at which point new and existing patients will lose access to these potentially life-saving services. Although the Biden administration is likely to extend the public health emergency at least until January, that still only leaves precious few months for the notoriously slow wheels of bureaucracy to turn.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clock is ticking, and while the DEA has signaled its intention to make these regulations permanent, it is unclear whether they will be able to meet the looming deadline. And while some members of Congress have urged the DEA to fulfill this pledge “as soon as possible,” they too must be prepared to act with new legislation.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Telemedicine is not without risks, and some practitioners have expressed valid concerns that remote healthcare may lead to increased misuse or diversion of MAT from its intended purpose. However, with the U.S. drug crisis reaching truly epic proportions, the benefits of greater access to treatment significantly outweigh any potential harm. A recent study of over 500 opioid-involved deaths found only one was solely attributable to buprenorphine. Another found that increased use of telemedicine during the pandemic did not lead to an increase in misuse or overdose of methadone.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while some claim prescribing medication-assisted treatment merely “substitutes one opioid for another,” the truth is that medically-prescribed buprenorphine is far less dangerous than illicitly manufactured drugs like fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid more than 50 times stronger than heroin. Certainly, both have the potential for misuse, but if prescription MAT is a single lit match, illicit fentanyl is a raging four-alarm fire. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of MAT is much preferable to illicit drugs found online or on the street, and telemedicine is an important step to improving access to treatment and helping to unwind the Gordian knot of the U.S. opioid crisis. The goal of drug treatment programs should be to eliminate drug use, but for many suffering from OUD, recovery is an iterative process, and quitting may not be possible, at least not right away. In the meantime, drugs like buprenorphine and methadone can help curb withdrawal symptoms and cravings while dramatically reducing the likelihood of overdoses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the COVID-19 public health emergency draws to a close, it is imperative policymakers move quickly to make these effective, commonsense changes permanent so healthcare professionals can continue to reach those most in need. The risk of inaction is simply too great. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jim Crotty is an associate vice president at The Cohen Group, a strategic advisory firm in Washington, D.C.

        "description": "<p>(NEXSTAR) — Even though the state of California ranks among the least polluted states in the U.S. according to U.S. News and World Report, many of its cities rank among the most polluted in the nation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The American Lung Association's 2022 State of the Air report measures air pollution across the U.S. to find the cleanest and the most polluted places to live. The rankings are broken down into three categories, by ozone (smog), and particle pollution (soot) conditions both year-round and in the short-term. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDoorDash customer says delivery driver ate his chicken wings, left surprising note in bag\t\n\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the Golden State's biggest metros make up the Most Polluted Cities list, which, according to ALA, can increase likelihood of harmful health effects. Risks of breathing polluted air include asthma, child birth defects, and various lung cancers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All cities are in California unless otherwise specified. </p>\n\n\n\nBy ozoneBy year-round particle pollutionBy short-term particle pollution1.

        "description": "<p>The Texas Rangers announced that right-hander Kohei Arihara has been designated for assignment. The move opens up a roster spot for reliever Tyson Miller who has been selected to the roster.</p>\n<p>Arihara, 30, joined the Rangers after the 2020 season on a 2-year, $6.2MM contract, with an additional $1.24MM spent on his posting fee to the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. He posted a poor 6.86 ERA in 40 2/3 innings during the 2021 season and followed it up with a weaker 9.90 ERA in 20 innings this season. He fared better in the minors, logging a 4.88 ERA in 72 innings in the hitter-friendly Pacific Coast League this year. That’s come with a 20.4% strikeout rate, 5.8% walk rate and 52.8% ground ball rate.</p>\n<p>With the trade deadline now passed, the Rangers will have no choice but to put him on outright waivers or release waivers. Since he was outrighted earlier this year, he’ll have the right to refuse another outright assignment and elect free agency. If he signs a new contract with another team, that club will only have to pay him the prorated league minimum salary. The Rangers would be on the hook for the remainder of his salary.</p>\n<p>Miller, 27, makes his return to the show after he was briefly up with the team earlier this year as a COVID replacement, pitching three innings over two games. Since he was a COVID replacement, he was able to be removed from the roster without being placed on waivers. The rest of his season has been spent at Triple-A, throwing 83 2/3 innings with a 4.73 ERA. He has a strong 29.5% strikeout rate but a worrisome 10.4% walk rate. Since he’s been largely working as a starter, he’ll give Texas an option in the bullpen for a multi-inning outing.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Enlarge / The Atlantic hurricane season peaks on September 10. (credit: NOAA)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To state the obvious: This has been an unorthodox Atlantic hurricane season.</p>\n<p>Everyone from the US agency devoted to studying weather, oceans, and the atmosphere—the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration—to the most highly regarded hurricane professionals predicted a season with above-normal to well above-normal activity.</p>\n<p>For example, NOAA’s outlook for the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, predicted a 65 percent chance of an above-normal season, a 25 percent chance of a near-normal season and a 10 percent chance of a below-normal season. The primary factor behind these predictions was an expectation that La Niña would persist in the Pacific Ocean, leading to atmospheric conditions in the tropical Atlantic more favorable to storm formation and intensification. La Niña has persisted, but the storms still have not come in bunches.</p><p>Read 9 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

        "description": "<p>California will determine whether Democrats retain their majority in the House of Representatives. Conventional wisdom holds that the outcome of the midterm elections is a fait accompli in which Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will surrender her gavel to fellow Californian Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, but the actual outcome is far less foreordained, and the Golden State will have a big say in which Californian presides over the chamber in January 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason so many believe that Democrats are doomed to lose power is the historical trend in which the party that controls the White House typically loses seats in midterm elections. California is on the cutting edge, however, of a countervailing national trend — the country’s demographic revolution — and that trend is poised to scramble the midterm electoral calculus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans need to oust four Democratic incumbents this fall in order to capture control of the House. California changes the math — because it has five Republican incumbents in racially diverse districts where Democrats have an excellent opportunity to win. By concentrating on and flipping those seats, Democrats could put the elusive prize of power further out of Republican reach and require Republicans to win more than twice as many seats across the rest of the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big part of the reason that pundits underestimate the significance of the California contests is that they fail to factor in the implications of the demographic revolution. It’s a simple statistical fact that years of exit polling data affirm the reality that three-quarters of people of color nationally consistently vote Democratic (a fact which isn’t surprising when the opposing political party’s power is predicated on stoking white racial resentment). In California, the majority of eligible voters — 55 percent — are people of color, and Biden received 78 percent of their votes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of the leading political analysts, however, incorporate racial realities into their assessments and predictions. The race-neutral approach of Cook Political Report, for example, has resulted in the determination that just two California Republican-held seats are toss-ups (out of seven nationally), while they also put two Democratic Golden State seats in that category (out of 26 nationally).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve spent the past several months working with a talented team of data scientists to devise a ranking system, the New Majority Index (NMI), that deepens the data pool by also analyzing the racial composition of a district and the voter turnout patterns by racial group. The NMI shows a different picture that is much more promising for Democratic prospects — if they take a smart and race-conscious approach. When diversity data is incorporated, it shows that five Republican-held seats could certainly be flipped this November if voter turnout is maximized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the racial diversity of California, success in its electoral contests requires significant cultural competence and a deep understanding of the priorities and interests of the respective groups of color that comprise the state’s population. In two of the vulnerable Republican seats, Asian Americans will play pivotal roles. Orange County, California — the political launching pad for Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan — was long a Republican stronghold when it was a majority white. But — depictions in popular television shows aside — whites are now a distinct minority, just 38 percent, of the county’s population. In California as a whole, 76 percent of Asians backed Biden, but in two congressional races, Calif.-40 and Calif.-45, Asian American voter turnout was lower than that of whites. Addressing that racial voter turnout gap will be key to Democrats capturing those two seats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, Republicans have shown greater awareness of racial dynamics and acted on that knowledge by backing a Vietnamese woman, now-Congresswoman Young Kim (R-Calif.), as their standard-bearer in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the other three Republican-held competitive seats, it’s the Latino vote that will play kingmaker. Latinos cast 75 percent of their votes for Biden, but in these seats, the racial voter turnout gap is quite pronounced, with whites voting at a higher rate by an average of 11 percent. That’s tens of thousands of potential Latino votes not coming into play in each of the competitive seats, two of which were decided by less than 1 percent in 2020. This racial vote gap points the path to power for Democrats if they will open their eyes and look at the data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the potential is evident, like a garden that could yield bountiful fruit, it requires the deployment of significant time, energy and resources to get the garden to blossom. Unfortunately, too few in the Democratic establishment understand the math or map to flipping the House. The standard Democratic modus operandi is to craft and broadcast ads that proceed from the premise that most voters have fickle political allegiances that are susceptible to commercials extolling the virtues of President Biden and the Democrats. House Majority PAC has announced plans to spend $121 million, but almost all of its money is focused on running television ads focused on trying to fight for the affection of the largely white cluster of voters seen as “swing voters.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fundamentally, smart spending means moving millions of dollars to the organizations and leaders with strong track records of moving voters of color to the polls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The history of political races involving Republican Rep. David Valadao, who represents the state’s heavily Latino Central Valley, is instructive. In 2018, progressive donors moved hundreds of thousands of dollars to Communities for a New California (CNC), an organization with roots in the state’s vaunted farmworker movement, and CNC hired teams of community-based canvassers to knock on doors and make phone calls to 40,000 voters, most of whom were Latino. As a result, Valadao was ousted, by a margin of 862 votes. Two years later, the urgency had dissipated, the progressive investments dried up, and Valadao was able to recapture the seat, winning by less than 1 percent. This year, he is running in a district that is 59 percent Latino and facing a Latino opponent, Rudy Salas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news for progressives is that California has a robust civic engagement infrastructure across the state with strong electoral organizations in the counties where the vulnerable Republican members are — Orange County, San Bernardino, the Central Valley and even Los Angeles. In addition to CNC, organizations such as OC Action, IE United, CHIRLA Action Fund have deep ties, long histories and solid track records of helping voters of color overcome the myriad obstacles to voting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the party and the country’s Democratic donors invest in bringing that infrastructure to scale and party leaders unapologetically champion their support for and defense of multi-racial democracy, they can flip the seats in California that will enable the party to keep control of Congress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve Phillips is the host of Democracy in Color with Steve Phillips, a color-conscious podcast about politics.

        "description": "<p>President Biden on Sunday touted the killings of two al Qaeda leaders following the 9/11 attacks as he marked the 21-year anniversary of the attacks during a ceremony at the Pentagon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The enduring resolve of the American people to defend ourselves against those who seek us harm and deliver justice to those responsible for the attacks against our people has never once faltered,” Biden said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It took 10 years to hunt down and kill Osama bin Laden, but we did, and this summer I authorized a successful strike on [Ayman] al-Zawahiri,” he continued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Al-Zawahiri, bin Laden's deputy, took control of al Qaeda after bin Laden's killing in 2011 and died in a U.S. drone strike in late July.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden completed the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer, ending a roughly 20-year presence that began in 2001 shortly after the attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The withdrawal came as the Taliban quickly regained control of the country, leading to troubling scenes at the Kabul airport where thousands attempted to flee the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thousands hoping to escape still remain trapped in Afghanistan or in other countries as they attempt to reach the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now more than one year following the withdrawal, Biden is leveraging the killing of al-Zawahiri as proof that the U.S. retains an ability to fight al Qaeda and other terrorist groups without any ground forces in Afghanistan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Afghanistan is over, but our commitment to preventing another attack [against] the United States is without end,” Biden said at the Pentagon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our intelligence, defense and counterterrorism professionals in the building behind me and across the government continue their vigilance against terrorist threats that [have] evolved and spread to new regions of the world,” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others have noted that al-Zawahiri lived in Afghanistan's capital when he was killed, casting doubt on the Taliban's commitment to not allow al Qaeda to operate in areas the Taliban controls under the Doha Agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden on Sunday vowed to not hesitate and to disrupt terrorist activities “wherever they exist.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What was destroyed, we have repaired,” Biden said. “What was threatened, we fortified.

        "description": "<p>Weeks of falling gas prices are dulling what had previously been a sharp Republican weapon, giving Democrats another glimmer of hope ahead of the midterm elections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Months ago, sky-high gas prices were a major reason why Democrats’ prospects looked bleak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as candidates hit the homestretch ahead of the Nov. 8 midterms, the lower gas prices are giving reasons for Democrats to think they can be more competitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It takes a lot of the effectiveness out of a cudgel when people aren’t seeing and feeling it as much,” Democratic strategist Eddie Vale said of gas prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since hitting a June peak of $5.02 on average across the country, U.S. gasoline prices have fallen by $1.28 and are averaging about $3.74 per gallon as of Friday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s still relatively high and up about 56 cents from a year ago. It’s about $1.18 higher compared to the same day in 2019, prior to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the prices are going in a better direction for consumers and the party in power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans have sought to make the election about inflation — with gas prices being a heavy target. But some polls suggest voters are now looking at other issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent poll from Marist, fewer Americans cited inflation as their top voting issue than in a previous poll, indicating that at least some focus is shifting onto other topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Marist found that 30 percent of Americans still consider inflation to be their top voting issue, that number is down from 37 percent of respondents who said the same in July. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Marist poll also found the number of those surveyed who said abortion was their top issue was growing, from 18 percent in July to 22 percent in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democrats have zeroed in on abortion rights as a key midterm issue ever since the Supreme Court struck down the Roe v. Wade decision in June. The party has won two special House elections since the court’s decision amid some evidence that more women are registering to vote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cook Political Report also cited lower gas prices as the second-biggest reason why Democrats appear in a better political position than they were a few months ago, writing that the fall is “taking some bite out of Republicans' ‘Biden-flation’ message.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be sure, Democrats still face some serious hurdles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, the party that holds the presidency has lost congressional seats during midterm elections. And while President Biden’s approval ratings have started to rise in some polls, more than 50 percent in several recent polls say they disapprove of his policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Low approval ratings for a president are generally a serious drag on lawmakers in that president's party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, while Democrats remain the underdog to hold on to the House majority, they are starting to feel better about cutting into their potential losses in the lower chamber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the party is feeling much better about retaining its Senate majority as candidates in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin show signs of strength.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Supreme Court’s abortion decision is seen as the biggest reason why the future looks brighter for Democrats, and why the party pulled off key wins in those special House elections in New York and Alaska last month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Vale said the gasoline price drop is also having significant political impacts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s something that people feel every two days, five days, seven days depending on how long your commute is,” he said. “Even if you’re not filling up your tank, you’re driving by like 10 gas stations with the signs every day, so it’s very front-of-mind.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans argue that they still have the upper hand on the issue given where prices stand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Voters still care that gas prices are through the roof,” said Michael McAdams, communications director of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party’s campaign arm for House races. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s undeniable that the most important issue for every voter – doesn’t matter where you live whether it’s in Oregon or Florida — [is] the rising cost of everything,” McAdams said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>GOP strategist Doug Heye similarly said in a statement that Republican candidates should continue to hammer their Democratic opponents on gasoline prices and inflation more broadly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Even as [prices] have fallen and Democrats try to take credit, that money — or the money families spend on eggs, ground beef and vegetables, or housing — is not going back in their pockets,” Heye said in an email. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is still the #1 issue for Republicans and Independents. GOP candidates should spend all day every day reminding voters of those things,” he added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In their own messaging on the issue, Vale said that Democrats need to strike a balance between acknowledging that the country is still grappling with inflation and trying to take credit for downward price trends. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Since you’re seeing a lot of the inflation soften or even decrease in some areas, you can take credit broadly speaking,” he said. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Former Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) said on Sunday that she believes the Democratic Party has an age problem as November’s midterm elections loom. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” McCaskill, who is now a political analyst for NBC News and MSNBC, told moderator Chuck Todd that she believes her party is struggling with the issue of age among its leaders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McCaskill noted people she considers “ancient” are running the party. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“But I will tell you I do think the Democratic Party is struggling with an issue that is real and that is all of our leadership,” McCaskill said during the roundtable discussion. “And I'm saying this as somebody who's ancient, you know, a lot of us are running the Democratic Party now in every part of the Democratic Party.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>McCaskill, who was defeated in her reelection bid by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) in 2018,  also said that her party needs to establish an initiative to have more younger people in the forefront, citing the importance of the 2024 election. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think the Democratic Party will benefit from really doing some navel-gazing about how can we get more young people to the forefront because young people are going to be really important to us in 2024,” McCaskill added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>McCaskill’s remarks come after Vice President Harris told Todd in a separate interview that aired Sunday that she will run again with Biden if he intends to run for reelection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Listen, the president has been very clear that he intends to run again. And if he does, I will be running with him proudly,” Harris told Todd. “Proudly. I’m very proud to be his vice president.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>After the post-2020 election fiasco, with Donald Trump trying to overturn a legitimate election, there is more focus on state election officials with electoral and voting responsibilities, governors and secretaries of state — and state supreme courts, which in a number of battleground states are elected: Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, to cite a few. Other than Pennsylvania, they are in play this year with big political implications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Redistricting and voting rights have been major legal controversies in these states. With the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June to end 50 years of federal abortion rights, turning the issue back to the states, these courts could play a critical role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans say they're geared up, realizing as a spokesman declared, these courts \"will affect the redistricting process for the next decade.\" Democrats, who were caught napping a decade ago on state legislative redistricting, insist they're ready this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good place to start is North Carolina. The Democrats on that supreme court have rejected the right-wing Republican legislature's repeated racial and partisan gerrymandering on congressional and state legislative districts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Democrats’ 4-3 majority is endangered this year, as two of their members are up for reelection, including Sam Ervin IV, the grandson of the legendary Watergate Senator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the GOP wins one of those seats, it's expected to bring back a new map for congressional districts in 2024 that will be even more partisan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That wouldn't be necessary if they win the \"independent legislature\" case they brought to the U.S. Supreme Court. Basically, this would cut state courts out of redistricting, and maybe election challenges altogether, giving a blank check to the state legislature. What had been considered a fringe view may find receptivity from this Republican Supreme Court.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On abortion, North Carolina’s Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has countered some Republican efforts to curb protections. But the GOP hopes to pick up enough state legislative seats to override any Cooper veto. It then would go to the state courts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months ago, Republicans were confident they could win those two supreme court elections. But Mac McCorkle, a Duke professor and former top Democratic strategist, says the environment has changed. \"Ever since Dobbs (the U.S. Supreme Court decision), there has been a palpable move towards Democrats in North Carolina.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stakes also are big in Ohio, where there are three seats up on the state court and Democrats probably have to win two of them to take control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ohio court, with the Republican chief justice joining three Democrats, twice threw out blatant gerrymandering of both state and congressional districts. The Republican legislature basically ignored these orders and ran out the clock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rule of law in what has become arguably the most corrupt state in America, is an inconvenience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the GOP justices on the Ohio supreme court is the son of the governor and votes on issues affecting his father. Another justice has compared the 1973 Roe abortion rights decision to slavery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans have the advantage in the Buckeye state, with Gov. Mike DeWine headed to reelection, although the U.S. Senate race there is a tossup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no better contemporary example of the political significance of a state supreme court than Michigan. In 2020, the Democrats won a majority for the first time in more than two decades. \"That has been a huge deal,\" notes Bill Ballenger, publisher of the Ballenger Report on Michigan politics. He expects the two justices up for election this year — one a Democrat the other a Republican — will win, with Democrats retaining their 4-3 majority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Dobbs decision, Michigan was slated to revert to a 1931 law banning abortions. That was thrown out by a Michigan judge. A few days ago, the Michigan supreme court, over the objections of some Republicans, approved putting an abortion rights referendum on the November ballot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a state that is overwhelmingly pro-choice, that's a big boost for Democrats, from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on down the ballot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, in one heavily Democratic state, Illinois, there are two state court seats up in October; if Republicans win both, they would take control of the court and be positioned to thwart Democratic initiatives. That may be uphill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several other states, including Montana and Kentucky, feature a direct contest between a pro-choice Democrat and an anti-abortion Republican.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The outcome of a number of these races may be affected by the national political climate this fall. One Republican edge is well-heeled business support in states like Ohio. But in most of the competitive contests, Democrats are fielding women candidates, which this year may be a real advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Al Hunt is the former executive editor of Bloomberg News.

        "description": "Photo by Kyle Rivas/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Can Detroit get the brooms out and tie up the season series with a three-game sweep against Kansas City?</p> <p>It’s that magical time of the year when you can choose to watch the Detroit Tigers lose or choose to watch the Detroit Lions lose on any given Sunday. Okay, maybe you’d prefer a win from both teams like myself, but beggars can’t be choosers.</p>\n<p>Putting football aside for a second, the Tigers have been on fire lately, outscoring the Kansas City Royals 18-6 over the last two games. Those two wins not only set up the chance for a road sweep of the Royals but also gives the Tigers a shot at tying the season series. A quick glance at both teams’ records also tells us that this matchup could help decide who finishes last in the AL Central.</p>\n<p>The recent offensive spark has been a team effort. The young guys, Spencer Torkelson, Riley Greene and Kerry Carpenter have found a bit of a groove, and even guys like Eric Haase are seeing the ball well. These are the kind of late-season improvements that can carry over to next year, and even though it sounds cliche, these last 22 games are incredibly valuable for the young core that’s going to lead this team through years six, seven, eight and nine of this rebuild.</p>\n<p>Detroit Tigers (54-85) at Kansas City Royals (56-84)</p>\n<p>Time/Place: 2:10 p.m., Kauffman StadiumSB Nation Site: Royals ReviewMedia: Bally Sports Detroit, MLB.TV, Tigers Radio NetworkPitching Matchup: LHP Tyler Alexander (3-9, 5.23 ERA) vs. RHP Brady Singer (7-4, 3.38 ERA)</p>\n\n<p>On the pitching side of things, the Tigers will throw lefty Tyler Alexander. He’s been replaceable this season with an ERA of 5.23 and FIP of 5.04 to match. His negative WAR comes as no surprise, and his slow stuff isn’t generating the same swing-and-miss rates it once was. That’s a problem for a pitcher like Alexander who tops out at around 91 or 92 mph.</p>\n<p>In 2021, Alexander’s changeup generated a 26.5% whiff rate. This year it’s down to 14.9%. The same goes for his slider from 2021 to 2022. He dropped from 24.4% to 13.9%. They’ve figured him out, and that could mean we’ll see less and less of that beautiful mustache in 2023, but the numbers do not lie. Alexander has been the definition of replaceable, and he’ll have to bounce back somehow to prove that he still deserves a spot in the rotation when the new general manager comes to town.</p>\n<p>Alexander hasn’t lasted five innings over his last three starts, so this could be that bounce-back game for him.</p>\n<p>On Kansas City’s side, former Florida Gator Brady Singer continues to improve in year three of his major league career. The strikeouts have always been there for him, but now he’s learning to go deeper into games while keeping things close. His last time out against Detroit in July, Singer struck out nine Tigers but only lasted 4 2⁄3 innings after giving up a trio of runs. Knocking him out early is key for Detroit this Sunday, but that’s easier said than done.</p>\n<p>Singer features a 94 mph sinker and an 85 mph slider that fools people often. Seriously, his slider has a 34.7 whiff percentage, which is way up from 29.1% a year ago. He’s found his put-away pitch, and it’s looking dangerous.</p>\n<p>If the Tigers can get to the bullpen early, the chances for a sweep are high. Baseball can be a streaky sport, and this is as good as we’ve seen Detroit hit it all year. Hopefully, the luck keeps up and the Tigers and Lions end the day with a win.</p>\n\n\n<p>No PPR, but we're looking to flex in the finale. pic.twitter.com/MvlaeLCFQS</p>— Detroit Tigers (@tigers) September 11, 2022",

Atlanta managed just three hits and an unearned run against George Kirby and the Seattle bullpen Saturday night. The loss dropped the Braves back into second place in the NL East standings, a half game behind the New York Mets.</p>\n<p>Jake Odorizzi will return to the Braves rotation Sunday after having his spot skipped while he dealt with some arm fatigue. He completed a bullpen session earlier this week without any problems and will make his sixth start in an Atlanta uniform Sunday. Odorizzi, who the Braves acquired from Houston at the trade deadline, struggled in his first three outings allowing 22 hits and nine earned runs in 13 2/3 innings. He pitched better in his next two starts allowing three runs combined in 11 2/3 innings. He tossed five scoreless innings in his last start against the Cardinals, but came back out for the sixth and gave up two runs before exiting. </p>\n<p>The Mariners will counter with lefty Marco Gonzales who will be make his 28th start of the season Sunday for the Mariners. Gonzales has been a workhorse for Seattle piling up 153 2/3 innings to go along with a 3.98 ERA and a 5.00 FIP. He allowed four hits, including two homers, and three runs over seven innings in his last start against the White Sox. </p>\n<p>Braves outfielder Michael Harris went hitless in Saturday’s loss snapping his 15-game hitting streak. Since August 1, Harris is hitting .357/.404/.635 with seven home runs and a 186 wRC+. Vaughn Grissom had one of Atlanta’s three hits Saturday night. After a slight lull to end August, Grissom has heated back up in September going 11-for-28 with two doubles and two home runs over his last eight games. </p>\n<p>Sunday’s game is scheduled to get underway at 4:10 p.m. ET and can be seen on Bally Sports Southeast. </p>\nGame Info\n<p>Game Date/Time: Sunday, September 11, 4:10 p.m. ET </p>\n<p>Location: T-Mobile Park, Seattle, Washington</p>\n<p>TV: Bally Sports Southeast</p>\n<p>Streaming: MLB.tv</p>\n<p>Radio: 680 AM / 93.7 FM The Fan</p>",

While at Lancaster House, foreign leaders will be able to deliver a tribute to the late queen lasting up to three minutes, which will be recorded for the media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the day of the funeral, the heads of state and their partners will arrive at Westminster Abbey in escorted coaches from a location in west London, where “because of tight security and road restrictions” they will be required to leave their own cars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Multiple and comprehensive layers of security will be in place across London and at all the official venues used for the state funeral and associated events,” a second FCDO document detailing the logistical arrangements for those traveling from overseas states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In line with the rules of the government’s mourning period, and “because of the extensive ceremonial programme related to the state funeral and the logistical challenges, requests for bilaterals will not be considered on this occasion,” the FCDO warned in the note.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the funeral service, foreign leaders will be escorted on foot to Dean’s Yard, still within the grounds of the abbey, to attend a reception hosted by Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, after which they will return by coach to west London to collect their cars.  </p>\n\n\n\nNo private jets, please \n\n\n\n<p>“Where possible,” the FCDO advised, foreign leaders should arrive in the U.K. on commercial flights, warning that London Heathrow airport will not be available for private flight arrangements or aircraft parking. Those leaders insisting on traveling by private jet should head for “less busy airports” around London, the FCDO added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of helicopter transfers between airports and venues has been banned “due to the number of flights operating at this time,” the department said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in a message all-too-familiar to weary passengers using U.K. airports this year, the FCDO also warned that “unforeseen events may require commercial and private flights to divert from the intended airport of arrival.”</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover the London Playbook newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>What’s driving the day in Westminster.

Pavely-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Stephenson and Crowe stumble late, blow 3-0 lead</p> <p>The Pirates looked like they were on cruise control early in this one. Rodolfo Castro and Jack Suwinski homered, Cardinals starter Jack Flaherty was walking guys like he was getting paid bonuses for them, and there were hits too. </p>\n<p>But, as has happened all season, the Pirates couldn’t hold the three-run lead, and the Cardinals, getting help from all up and down their battery, took the victory, 7-5.</p>\n<p>JT Brubaker seemed in control, despite walking lead-off batter (and former Pirate) Corey Dickerson to begin the game. He was getting groundouts and double plays. Of course, it helped that Rodolfo Castro solo-homered in the bottom of the first. In the second, Ke’Bryan Hayes walked, and Jack SuWINski homered, like so:</p>\n\n\n<p>Jack-Jack! pic.twitter.com/KDliQUy36J</p>— Pittsburgh Pirates (@Pirates) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>But the Cardinals are good and shook off the cobwebs that seemed to envelop them Friday night. Brendan Donovan homered in the fifth to erase the goose egg, then Albert Pujols had to jack one to add to his number and tie the game at three in the sixth, as well as Alex Rodriguez’s homers numbers, as Brubaker had given up a double to Tyler O’Neill earlier.  But then there was this Cruz Missile off Cardinals reliever Jo Jo Romero:</p>\n\n\n<p>CRUZ HITS MISSILES pic.twitter.com/iCXO0fbTvk</p>— Pittsburgh Pirates (@Pirates) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>But then the sails deflated on the Pirate Ship—Albert Pujols showed that he only needed to hit a single to help tie things up after a Nolan Gorman double off Stephenson in the eighth, and Wil Crowe loaded the bases in the ninth and paid for it.</p>\n<p>This is the most frustrating thing about the Pirates in my opinion—they never seem to run regularly on all cylinders. If the pitching is on, the hitting or defense dies, and vice versa. But today the closest person the Pirates have had to an ace this season, Mitch Keller, is on the mound today against former (and possibly future) Pirate Jose Quintana. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

That loss pushed them to five games back of the AL’s final wild card spot, a gap they haven’t experienced since July.</p>\n<p>It was an ugly game that you wouldn’t expect a “playoff contender” to put forth in mid-September. But ultimately it has the same impact on the Orioles’ playoff hopes as a 1-0 loss would have. At least you could turn off last night’s game relatively early and do something else with your Saturday evening.</p>\n<p>Today brings with it another battle for your attention. Identical start times for the Orioles, Ravens, and Commanders likely means that for, many readers of this site, your TV remote will be getting a serious workout.</p>\n<p>The decision of which team gets more attention could become easier over the next week. The Orioles really need to go on a winning streak to stay close in the playoff race. Winning today to take this series from the Red Sox feels like a requirement, as does a quick sweep of the Nationals mid-week.</p>\n<p>But first things first: Stay dry, get Kyle Bradish back on track, and snag the win today, hopefully while a few other teams lose.</p>\nOrioles Starting Lineup\n\nRyan McKenna, CF\nAnthony Santander, RF\nRyan Mountcastle, 1B\nRamon Urías, 3B\nJesús Aguilar, DH\nAustin Hays, LF\nJorge Mateo, SS\nRougned Odor, 2B\nRobinson Chirinos, C\n\n<p>Kyle Bradish, RHP (3-5, 5.30 ERA)</p>\nRed Sox Starting Lineup\n\nTommy Pham, LF\nAlex Verdugo, RF\nXander Bogaerts, SS\nRafael Devers, 3B\nTrevor Story, 2B\nJ.D.

        "description": "<p>Written by Sara Herschander, Waging Nonviolence</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the first day of school at Norman High School last month, English teacher Summer Boismier covered up her classroom bookshelves with paper that said “Books the state doesn’t want you to read.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The coverings were a response to Oklahoma’s HB 1775, a state law enacted in May that restricts what educators can say about race and gender. She also posted a QR code leading students to Brooklyn Public Library’s Books Unbanned Project, which allows young people free access to books that might be restricted in their schools. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’re being forced into — to use a banned book reference — a catch-22,” said Boismier, who resigned after a parent complained about her teaching. “It’s either your paycheck or your principles.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the country, as students of all ages and educators return to the classroom, they’ve been fighting back against the unprecedented assault on antiracist and LGBTQ-inclusive teaching. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oklahoma isn’t the only state attempting to curb classroom conversations and resources around race, gender and sexuality. According to PEN America, school districts in 26 states have banned or opened investigations into more than 1,100 books in the past nine months alone. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Florida Teacher Shows #BucksCounty Educators How To Fight Back Against Book Banning | After ordered to take a Vonnegut classic off the shelves, this teacher raised over $25K to put “Slaughterhouse-Five” &amp; other challenged books into the hands of students. https://t.co/ideJoMRMLj pic.twitter.com/U3dHFTEdcu</p>— BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) June 13, 2022\n\n\n\n\n<p>“These laws are silencing many of these important conversations, chilling speech and restricting student access to these identity-affirming texts,” said Boismier, who has had to leave her home after experiencing harassment and threats for her outspoken opposition to HB 1775. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oklahoma Education Secretary Ryan Walters also called for the revocation of Boismier’s teacher’s certificate, and claimed that the LGBTQ-inclusive books available to students through Brooklyn Public Library amounted to “pornographic material.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have state leadership who are describing stories centering marginalized communities, specifically associated with race and gender, as obscene or pornographic,” Boismier said. “I cannot imagine what it must be like for a student in one of these communities to hear an individual in the highest office in the state refer to their stories — their experiences — as obscenity.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In several schools and universities, the attacks on antiracist and LGBTQ-inclusive education go beyond book bans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Texas this week, around 100 students at Grapevine High School walked out of class over new district policies targeting the LGBTQ community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Brigham Young University, a dozen counter-protesters dressed as angels to shield queer community members from hundreds of anti-LGBTQ protesters during a back to school pride night in Provo, Utah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maddison Tenney — a senior at BYU and founder of the Raynbow Collective, which supports LGBTQ students at the university — came up with the idea for the angel counter-protests after watching a TikTok video of the ‘angels’ who showed up against anti-LGBTQ protesters during the trials of Matthew Shepard’s killers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I knew this was what we had to do — this is how we show that there are more people with us than against us,” Tenney said. “And, to make a statement about the power of religion and the queer community, and to show that it can’t be weaponized to hurt us anymore.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaliah Jambalaya, a local student and drag queen who organized and performed at the event, was touched by the outpouring of support from other community members and allies. Drag performers at the event were the primary targets of the far-right protesters, as part of a broader series of attacks and protests against drag across the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’ve only been out of the closet for a year and a half, so seeing those people put themselves between me and the people that hate me meant a lot to me,” Jambalaya said. “I never thought somebody would do that for me growing up.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Like @centralyorksd students, #BucksCounty youth must rise up to defend education from the far-right's attempts to ethnically cleanse curricula of Black and Brown voices—from @PennridgeSD – #Pennsbury. #BannedBooksWeek2021 @CYBannedBooks  https://t.co/dZjgLtrYGJ via @couriertimes</p>— Cyril Mychalejko (@cmychalejko) September 30, 2021\n\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, students at Central High School in Pennsylvania returned to school with a victory. Last fall, members of the school’s Panther Anti-Racist Student Union, or PARU, successfully forced district leaders to reverse a decision to ban a list of antiracist resources and literature, built to educate teachers and students about Black history. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reversal came after students and teachers organized deliberate and targeted walk-outs at the school, which attracted media attention and put pressure on administrators. It’s a strategy that Ben Hodge, a teacher and faculty advisor for PARU, hopes that other teachers and students can replicate as they struggle against their own book bans across the country. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I would encourage educators and students who are dealing with book bans and legislation to stay the course and not give up,” Hodge said. “Connect with other people, find your support, and rally together — we are so much stronger together.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sara Herschander is a freelance journalist and audio producer based in New York City.

        "description": "<p>Former MLB pitcher Andy Pettitte said on Sunday that competitive sports are still one way that could unify a politically divided U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” anchor Shannon Bream asked Pettitte for his thoughts on some aspects of sports becoming too political.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, headlines of prominent athletes using their platforms to speak on societal and inequality issues have dominated the news such as former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick's protest during the national anthem. There have been a host of athletes using their platforms to speak up against racism, particularly during the summer of 2020. There was also Japanese tennis star Naomi Osaka and U.S. gymnast Simone Biles stepping away from their competitive sports to focus on their mental health. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Well, I think so. I mean sports have always been just, you know, something that unified us,” Pettitte told Bream, sharing experiences from his childhood of attending sports events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pettitte, a three-time All-Star selection and five-time World Series champion with the New York Yankees, also noted how sports helped unify the country in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attack, describing how the country proudly supported both the Yankees and Mets, New York's famed based baseball teams and bitter rivals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And in the sense of 9/11, just what an opportunity that was and that we saw, you know, as the players, the way that everyone rallied around us, you know, and rallied around as a team,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And then whether you were a part of the Yankees or the Mets at that time, or you were just a fan, what 9/11 really did was make you feel like you – we were all a part of the same team. And so, as we move forward, of course we need to remember for sure, but continue to try to unify our country and unify each other. And I think baseball and the sports is a great way to do that,” he concluded. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pettitte's remarks come as Sunday marked the 21st anniversary of 9/11, which took the lives of more than 3,000 Americans. </p>",

I think it is very dangerous. I think it is very harmful and it makes us weaker,\" Harris told host Chuck Todd on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" during a discussion on domestic threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vice president noted that the U.S. historically has had the \"honor and privilege\" of exemplifying a \"great democracy,\" which has given the country the grounding to champion democratic principles throughout the world and act as a \"role model\" for democracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Harris warned that recent events, such as some elected officials denying the results of the 2020 presidential election and other refusing to condemn the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, cause countries around the world to question the United States' \"commitment\" toward democracy, and said that she is \"very concerned.\" </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>WATCH: @VP Harris says she’s “very concerned” about the message the U.S. is sending on democracy.“There are 11 people right now running for secretary of state, the keepers of the integrity of the voting system of their state, who are election deniers.” pic.twitter.com/gDfpBy9YTL</p>— Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\n<p>Todd, noting the 21st anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on Sunday, asked if domestic threats are \"equal of greater than what we faced after 9/11.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris replied that she has taken many oaths of office, vowing to defend and uphold the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic, adding that \"we don't compare the two in the oath, but we know they both can exist and we must defend against it.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The fact is having served under the Senate Intelligence Committee and now as vice president, I can tell you the nature of domestic threat versus a foreign threat— they're very different,\" Harris said. \"Note, both are harmful and extremely dangerous, but they're very different.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"When I think about what we have been seeing from the attacks from within, I wish that we would approach it the same way as Americans instead of through some partisan lens,\" she added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

I was in the middle of a political campaign and suddenly, the differences with my opponent seem very small in comparison and our country came together,\" Warner said on CBS “Face the Nation” with host Margaret Brennan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The stunning thing to me is here we are 20 years later, and the attack on the symbol of our democracy was not coming from terrorists, but it came from literally insurgents attacking the Capitol on Jan. 6.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warner lauded the nation’s unity and progress in the face of international terror threats, and said he hopes the country can similarly rally in the face of domestic challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I believe our intelligence community has performed remarkably. I think the threat of terror has diminished … But I do worry about some of the activity in this country where the election deniers, the insurgency that took place on Jan. 6, that is something I hope we could see that same kind of unity of spirit.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warner leads what he called “the last functioning bipartisan committee,” the Intelligence Committee, along with vice chairman Sen.

The club already had a vacancy on their 40-man roster.</p>\n<p>Archer, 33, started yesterday’s game but was removed after two innings and 40 pitches due to this pec issue. Park relays that Archer is confident he can return after the 15-day minimum, though it’s still a noteworthy development for the club. With just over three weeks remaining in the season, even a minimum stay on the IL will keep Archer out of action until there’s only about a week remaining.</p>\n<p>With Tyler Mahle also landing on the IL about a week ago, the club’s rotation has taken a couple of blows at a crucial time of the year. The Twins are 3 1/2 games behind the Guardians in the AL Central race, with the White Sox in between. Minnesota will be trying to play catch-up in the home stretch with a diminished pitching staff. Josh Winder was recalled today and will take a spot in the rotation next to Dylan Bundy, Sonny Gray and Joe Ryan. That four-man crew will need reinforcements as the club has an off-day on Monday before embarking on a stretch of 14 games in 13 days, with a doubleheader on September 17.</p>\n<p>Archer is taking on a significant workload for the first time since 2019, as he missed the 2020 season entirely and only logged 19 1/3 innings last year. Through 102 2/3 frames this season, he has a 4.56 ERA, though his 19.2% strikeout rate and 11% walk rate are both career worsts. He’s likely returning to free agency this winter, as his deal with the Twins has a mutual option for 2023, with those rarely being executed by both sides.</p>\n<p>Cotton, 30, has already been designated for assignment by the Twins three times this year, each time accepting an outright assignment to St. Paul and getting selected back to the roster later. He’s pitched well when called upon, registering a 2.83 ERA in 35 big league innings on the year. A .182 BABIP and 89.7% strand rate are likely putting a little shine on that, however, with advanced metrics like FIP and xFIP pushing over 5.00.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Athletics announced that they have selected the contract of right-hander Collin Wiles. Fellow right-hander Domingo Tapia was designated for assignment in a corresponding move.</p>\n<p>Tapia, 31, came to the A’s on a waiver claim in April and has been shuttled back and forth between Triple-A and the big leagues all year. In 27 2/3 innings for the Las Vegas Aviators, he has a 1.95 ERA, 21.8% strikeout rate, 8.4% walk rate and 51.9% ground ball rate. However, he hasn’t been able to bring that kind of performance up to the show with him, registering an ERA of 8.47 in 17 MLB innings, along with a 13.3% strikeout rate and ghastly 15.6% walk rate.</p>\n<p>He’ll be placed on outright waivers or release waivers in the coming days, since the trade deadline has passed. He’s never previously been outrighted and has less than three years of MLB service time, meaning he wouldn’t have the ability to reject an outright assignment in favor of free agency.</p>\n<p>Wiles, 28, was originally drafted by the Rangers, getting selected 53rd overall in 2012. He worked his way up the minor league ladder but never got the call to the big leagues, reaching free agency after 2021. He signed a minor league deal with the A’s and has spent his entire season in Triple-A so far. In 143 1/3 innings over 26 starts for Las Vegas, he has a 5.40 ERA. His 17% strikeout rate isn’t great but he’s only walking 4.3% of batters faced. Since he’s been working as a starter in the minors, he’ll give the A’s a bullpen option who should be capable or working multiple innings. He’ll be making his MLB debut as soon as he gets into a game.</p>",

        "description": "Gregory Fisher-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>The Yankees go for the crucial series win.</p> <p>After one rough loss and one fun win, the Yankees and Rays square off today to see who will take this oh-so-important series. The Rays remain 4.5 games behind the Yankees as they did when the three-game set started — this will decide who gains or loses ground in the division. It will also be the last time they square off in 2022, unless the postseason has other plans.</p>\n<p>The Yankees are starting Domingo Germán on short rest, after the rainout on Tuesday threw a wrench into their normal rotation. With three offdays coming off in the next week, Germán might not start again for a bit, so Boone suggested he take another turn today, according to Lindsey Adler of The Athletic. </p>\n<p>Germán is coming off a solid start in the first game of Wednesday’s doubleheader against the Twins. He gave up three earned runs over six innings while striking out six, though you’d be forgiven for forgetting about that aspect of that 12-inning game. </p>\n<p>The Rays counter with Luis Patiño. The 22-year-old hasn’t started much this year for the Rays, having dealt with oblique and blister issues and spent time in the minors. He’s stepped into the rotation following the injury to Shane McClanahan, however, and he did decently enough last time out, with three earned runs over five against the Red Sox. He’s only thrown 18.2 MLB innings this season, but he’s shown a big problem with walks, having issued nine.</p>\n<p>The Yankees play a similar lineup to the ones they’ve been forced to lately. Aaron Judge is still leading off and playing center, with Oswaldo Cabrera in right. Miguel Andújar will play left — still no Hicks after Friday’s disaster. </p>\n<p>Jonathan Aranda at first and Christian Bethancourt at catcher will start today for the Rays after not doing so yesterday. Randy Arozarena will play right after being DH yesterday, with Yandy Díaz taking that role today. Taylor Walls will play third base in his place. </p>\n<p>Note that there is some rain in New York at the moment and that the Yankees have already said that there will be a delay.</p>\n\n\n<p>Please be advised that today's game will not start on time. We will provide you with more information as it becomes available.</p>— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>First pitch is scheduled for approximately 3:20pm.</p>— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>How to watch</p>\n<p>Location: Yankee Stadium — Bronx, NY</p>\n<p>First pitch: 1:35 pm ET</p>\n<p>TV broadcast: YES Network, Bally Sports Sun, MLB Network (out-of-market only)</p>\n<p>Radio broadcast: WFAN 660/101.9, WADO 1380</p>\n<p>Online stream: MLB.tv</p>\n<p>For updates, follow us on Twitter and Instagram, and like us on Facebook.</p>\n\n\n<p>Sunday Series Finale. #RepBX Presented by @Hilton pic.twitter.com/x39McxxjF0</p>— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>#Rays lineup vs. #Yankees, with Aranda starting … pic.twitter.com/Ra3ch0mBi1</p>— Marc Topkin (@TBTimes_Rays) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) on Sunday said the Department of Justice (DOJ) has “a pretty good chance” in its appeal of an order for a special master to look over the documents seized by the FBI  at former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think the Justice Department's chances are pretty good,” Christie said on ABC’s “This Week.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump team had argued for the special master, alleging some seized documents were protected by executive privilege, and the Trump-appointee judge overseeing the case granted the request, preventing the DOJ from moving forward with its own review of the materials.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There's only one executive who can assert the privilege, and that's the one who is the current executive, Joe Biden. A previous executive can't assert executive privilege. They're not the executive any longer,” Christie said Sunday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Biden will not assert executive privilege over these documents. And I think the idea that some of these documents are somehow attorney-client privilege is going to be a bit of a reach ... So I think, for one, I think the DOJ probably has a pretty good chance on appeal.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christie on Sunday also defended the DOJ’s much-critiqued move to search Mar-a-Lago and seize the materials, saying the department \"had no choice.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It's not only the nature of the documents. We now have a good idea of the timeline. This has been 16 months that the Department of Justice has been saying please, asking nicely, negotiating with his attorneys, taking up partial production, seeing a non-response to a subpoena. They had no choice, in my view, but to go in and take them, because of the nature of the documents.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Newly unsealed records show FBI agents found more than 100 classified documents at the Palm Beach, Fla., resort — as well as dozens of empty folders marked as classified in Trump's personal office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christie recalled working with highly sensitive information, the likes of which were found at Mar-a-Lago, during his tenure as a U.S. attorney in New Jersey. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When I had to review that in the post-9/11 era, I had to go into a special room called the SCIF to review it. I couldn't take pictures. I couldn't take anything with me. [Trump] had that in the top drawer at Mar-a-Lago in his desk. That's a problem. I don't think he'll be prosecuted for it, but we ought to get those documents back.”</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3635075-putins-strategy-to-weaponize-winter/",
        "description": "<p>As the summer war in Ukraine transitions into autumn and the harvesting of sunflowers begins, repeated Russian military setbacks in the Donbas region and Kherson Oblast are forcing Vladimir Putin to show his hand. Impatient to reverse course on the battlefield, the Russian president is signaling that Moscow fully intends to weaponize Europe’s winter energy needs — for not just Ukraine but the entire European Union. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the current circumstances, though, Russian ground forces may not make it to winter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky possesses the Valyrian Steel sword; he just requires the Biden administration’s full confidence and support to wield it decisively and bury Putin’s “special military operation” in the fields of Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite long-range weather forecasts to the contrary, Putin is gambling on a brutally cold and snowy winter like that of 1941, which helped derail the German army’s attack on Moscow during Operation Barbarossa. Theoretically, the Kremlin’s strategic aim is to produce an energy crisis in the dead of a European winter to break the will of NATO from continuing to militarily and economically support Kyiv. The underlying assumption is that Europeans would choose warmth and comfort over Ukraine’s independence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin couldn’t be more wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S., NATO and the EU need to put on their best game face and shut down this course of action now. Putin is in trouble and the alliance has a small window of opportunity to drive Russia out of Ukraine before winter sets in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Russian offensive largely has stalled and, according to the Institute for the Study of War, the “Ukrainian counter-offensive is making verifiable progress in the south and the east. Ukrainian forces are advancing along several axes in western Kherson Oblast and have also secured territory across the Siverskyi Donets River in Donetsk Oblast.” Russian ground forces are digging in; however, their supply lines cannot sustain them, and they are losing ground. Putin is still intent on capturing Donetsk, extending his deadline for that to Sept. 15, but his commanders on the ground lack sufficient combat power. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin neither understands, nor appreciates, the condition of his soldiers, as evidenced by a United Kingdom Ministry of Defense intelligence report claiming a unit from the Luhansk People’s Republic delivered a “declaration outlining their refusal to be deployed as part of offensive operations in Donetsk Oblast.” The report specified that they had “done their duty securing the Luhansk Oblast” but were unwilling to fight in Donetsk. Another report said the 127th Regiment, a unit stood-up in April with men forcibly mobilized from Donetsk and Luhansk, refused to fight over a “lack of vital supplies.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, Putin’s war is largely limited to holding terrain and attempting to push through referendums to join Russia as expeditiously as possible, a reality not lost upon Moldova’s prime minister, Natalia Gavrilita, who, fearing the same, acknowledged, “If a country can start an annexation war without any regard for international law, then in this sense, nobody is safe.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Russian 3rd Army Corps, composed mostly of minimally trained volunteer battalions, is being sent to the front to shore up defenses and buy time, but it may take until November to get them and their decrepit equipment in position. While they await a cavalry, Russia once again will turn to its artillery to keep Ukraine’s military at arm’s length and continue the reign of terror against unarmed civilians in Kharkiv, Odesa and other towns in southern Ukraine. The undermanned, ill-equipped, and shell-shocked Russian forces tasked to “die in place” cannot survive without artillery support, and if it comes down to a close fight, their courses of action are fight, flight or surrender. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) provided by the U.S. and increased range of munitions provided by Germany make the latter two courses of action more likely. Ukrainian fighters continue to suppress Russia’s artillery and maneuver to close in on an army whose will largely has been broken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lynchpin to Putin’s “winterization” strategy, though, is energy — natural gas, and nuclear-powered electricity — and he needs a cold winter to play it. He built European dependence on Russian gas brilliantly over the past decade and is prepared to use it as leverage against NATO and EU countries supporting Ukraine. On Sept. 3, Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom announced it was shutting down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which distributes natural gas to Europe through Germany, and that “the pipeline will not resume in full until the collective West lifts sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact will be felt throughout Europe. The EU needs a plan to offset this supply issue now, not in November or December. The plan must include reinvestment in fossil fuels and nuclear power, and a Pattonesque type of prayer, the “Weather Prayer” composed and delivered by Catholic chaplain James Hugh O’Neill at the request of Gen. George S. Patton, to stop the rains and allow his Army to defeat Adolf Hitler at the Battle of the Bulge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin’s most viable course of action, the one he appears to be implementing now, is the weaponization of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP). It won’t win the war; it’s more akin to a desperate criminal who, cornered, grabs a hostage to negotiate this escape. The plant lost connection to its last external power line on Sept. 4 during shelling while International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors were present. Only one of its six reactors remains in operation. The ZNPP generates revenue for Ukraine, which exports electricity to Moldova, Romania, Slovakia and Poland. Ukraine recently offered to export electricity to Germany to help end its dependency on Russian energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither the German Blitz nor the Battle of Britain were able to force England to negotiate with or surrender to Hitler. Nor will Putin’s efforts to “freeze out” Europe this winter bring Ukraine or the EU to the negotiating table. Germany and Belgium recently announced measures they emplaced to “get through the winter,” and Liz Truss, the UK’s new prime minister, has proclaimed, “As strong as the storm may be, I know the British people are stronger.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, it will be an uncomfortable winter, but the people of Ukraine, the Baltic States, Poland, Moldova, Georgia and other countries once under Russia’s thumb understand the alternative. They are prepared to go the distance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU must impose measures to lessen the blow of Putin’s plan to weaponize winter. Belgium Prime Minister Alexander De Croo perhaps said it best: The EU needs to “stop the bleeding” of high energy prices. Its energy ministers must work with Ukraine, NATO and the IAEA to prepare for the possibility of a nuclear disaster at the ZNPP, its containment and clean-up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This war is bigger than Ukraine and victory can be secured only through offensive action. The Russian military is approaching its most vulnerable moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan Sweet, a retired Army colonel, served 30 years as a military intelligence officer.

There’s Tim Freedman’s distinctive voice; somehow as plaintive and clear as when he started singing, despite now pushing 60 years old. Then there is the wry cleverness of the lyrics, often focused on long nights (and mornings) out on the plonk, chasing elusive women and troubled friends. And Freedman leading from his piano, which feels almost old-fashioned for an alternative rock band – though that label has never felt like a comfortable fit for a group that dips in and out of blues, jazz and pop, from song to song.</p><p>I was six when their breakthrough album, Eternal Nightcap, came out; You Sound Like Louis Burdett will always hold a fond place in my heart for allowing me to say “fuck” in front of my parents for the first time. They are the first band I ever saw live and by far the band I have seen perform most often. That is to say: I have never felt so prepared to write a piece, or agonised over one so much.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p>This week, Google announced a roundup of new features that are in the process of rolling out to Android tablets, including a redesign of the widgets for Google Drive and Keep. Additionally, other Workspace app features had also been teased back in July that would improve the experience on tablet devices running Android 12L. One of these is the ability to run multiple instances of Docs, Sheets, or Slides, which is just now rolling out. However, a new feature has also just been announced that supercharges the usefulness of Google Keep.</p>\n\n\n\nDual pane view on Google Keep\n\n\n\n<p>As a follow up to drag and drop functionality while split screen is active, Google is now introducing Dual pane view on Keep. Unlike a regular split screen, this new feature allows you to browse one instance of Keep notes on the left side of your screen, while editing content on the right side of your screen.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Dual pane view for Keep began rolling out to Rapid and Scheduled Release domains on September 8, 2022 and will continue at a gradual pace that will last up to two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\nMulti-instance support on Docs, Sheets &amp; Slides\n\n\n\n<p>Multi-instance support on Docs, Sheets &amp; Slides was announced in July, however, the roll out scheduled specified that feature wouldn’t be ready until September. According to the latest Workspace release notes, this began rolling out to Rapid and Scheduled Release domains on September 7th, 2022 and will continue its gradual roll out for another two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Multi-instance effectively allows you to have two windows side-by-side of the same app. This can be done in Drive by tapping the three-dot menu on any file, choosing “Open in new window”, and then navigating through each Drive window independently.</p>\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Photo by Norm Hall/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Can Zac Gallen set a new franchise record?</p> \n\nToday's Lineups\n\n\n\n\nDIAMONDBACKS\nROCKIES\n\n\n\n\nJosh Rojas - 2B\nRyan McMahon - 2B\n\n\nDaulton Varsho - CF\nYonathan Daza - CF\n\n\nJake McCarthy - RF\nC.J.

He needs just to get through the first frame at Coors Field this afternoon, to set a new record for a Diamondback, the previous record being the 42.0 inning streak by Brandon Webb in 2007. If Gallen goes further, he'll continue to move up the rankings. He starts the day with the 8th longest scoreless streak in the live-ball era - here are the details of each of those.</p>\n\nOrel Hershiser, Dodgers, 59 IP, Aug. 30-Sept. 28, 1988\nDon Drysdale, Dodgers, 58 IP, May 14-June 8, 1968\nBob Gibson, Cardinals, 47 IP, June 2-26, 1968\nZack Greinke, Dodgers, 45 2/3 IP, June 18-July 26, 2015\nCarl Hubbell, Giants, 45 1/3 IP, July 13-Aug. 1, 1933\nSal Maglie, Giants, 45 IP, Aug. 16-Sept. 13, 1950\nBrandon Webb, D-backs, 42 IP, July 20-Aug. 17, 2007\nZac Gallen, D-backs, 41 1/3 IP, Aug. 8-Sept. 4, 2022\n\n<p>You can see, a scoreless outing like its predecessors for Zac, and he could potentially end the day in third spot. However, there is likely no worse spot to try and sustain a scoreless streak than Coors Field. There have been 146 starts in Denver this season, but only 15 of them (5 by the Rockies, 10 by visitors) have not allowed a run, so barely 10%. The odds are not in Gallen’s favor. However, against that, Zac is actually one of those 15, having blanked Colorado earlier in the streak. He tossed seven scoreless innings against the Rockies on August 13, so clearly knows how to pitch there. He has yet to lose in five Coors starts, possessing a 2.03 ERA in the ballpark. </p>\n<p>That is actually tied with former Diamondback Taijuan Walker for the best ERA there, by any pitcher with 5+ starts at Coors. Both men have allowed 7 ER over 31 innings, but Gallen’s K:BB of 29:5 is better than Walker's (30:12), so he probably wins the tiebreaker. If Zac can avoid defeat today, he'll join Adam Wainwright and Jordan Zimmermann as the only pitchers to go more than five career starts at Coors, without having taken an L. Of course, Gallen has an ongoing lossless streak across all outings, now at 15. Dodging defeat here would tie him with Robbie Ray's 2007-08 run of 16 starts, for 4th best with Arizona. So, a lot potentially to look forward to in this contest!</p>",

There’s Tim Freedman’s distinctive voice; somehow as plaintive and clear as when he started singing, despite now pushing 60 years old. Then there is the wry cleverness of the lyrics, often focused on long nights (and mornings) out on the plonk, chasing elusive women and troubled friends. And Freedman leading from his piano, which feels almost old-fashioned for an alternative rock band – though that label has never felt like a comfortable fit for a group that dips in and out of blues, jazz and pop, from song to song.</p><p>I was six when their breakthrough album, Eternal Nightcap, came out; You Sound Like Louis Burdett will always hold a fond place in my heart for allowing me to say “fuck” in front of my parents for the first time.

We forgot this vast and wonder-filled universe, of which we are each but a tiny and transient wonder.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We forgot that all creative work — be it music or mathematics, poetry or physics, anything we might call art — is a hand outstretched in the dark, reaching not for visibility but for the light that lives between us. Reaching for connection.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We forgot what Whitman knew even as he proclaimed “I celebrate myself!” — that “every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.” No word appears in Leaves of Grass more times than you.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We are living through a pandemic of selfing — rampant self-celebration that mistakes applause for connection, likes for love. Social media companies are capitalizing on our native need for affirmation, exploiting our compromised immunity to manipulation at every turn: algorithms prioritizing selfies over sunflowers, algorithms amplifying the word I, algorithms doping us on the dopamine of being noticed, seducing us into forgetting the art and joy of noticing — that crowning glory of consciousness. And somewhere, in the quiet core of our being, this frantic hunt for likes is making us like ourselves less.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There must be another way — a way to unself just enough to remember each other, to grow a little more awake to this world that shimmers with wonder, of which any one self is only a fleck.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Whatever that way is, it is not some new technology.

And if you don’t feel that warm glow of generosity, that good glad feeling of making another’s day, or simply the relief of a small sabbatical from the tedium of the self, then you can always go back to the old way.\n    </p>\n<p>Wherever you land, it will not have been a wasted month.</p>\ndonating = loving<p>For a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the unbearable name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/education/3637979-how-to-reduce-youth-violence/",
        "description": "<p>There’s a new violent tragedy seemingly every day in our communities, whether a mass murder in Sacramento, a school shooting in Highland Park or Uvalde, or a suicidal death of despair. Our children and young adults are struggling.A tragedy within this tragedy is that we know how to prevent children from growing up to be violent, but we haven’t done enough about it. A Secret Service study found almost two-thirds of school shooters had problems getting along with peers — including being bullied — in the period prior to the shooting. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has invested heavily in research over the past 30 years and researchers now know a great deal. Our research group has learned that efforts to support children, families and schools can change children’s paths from school failure, early drug use and delinquency to a positive outcome. One program is Fast Track, an NIH-funded project that started in 1990 in four U.S. communities. Scientists worked with high-risk first-grade children to develop the skills, knowledge and attitudes to have healthy relationships with others and make smart decisions when faced with life’s challenges. The research revealed that children assigned to Fast Track grew up to spend less time in prison, have fewer problems of substance abuse and are less of a financial burden to society. Fast Track is just one example of carefully tested evidence-based programs to reduce violent and mental disorder as well as promote healthy functioning in children and youth. The Blueprints Program is other exemplar programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development of social competence is like the development of literacy: It is not simply a matter of free will, but a lifelong process that involves learning specific component skills and attitudes accompanied by a love for social connectedness. As with literacy, we know the required skills: emotion understanding, self-control, social problem solving, self-awareness, executive function, delay of gratification and more. As with literacy, we know that a love for social connectedness begins at birth through caring interactions with parents and other caregivers and continues through interactions with peers and structured group experiences in school. As with literacy, this path can be tragically interrupted by abusive trauma or failure experiences.We now have ways to build social competence in our children. The path to a peaceful and fulfilling social life begins at birth through a secure parent-infant bond, and we have resources to support this relationship. We now have peer coaching programs to help kids develop strong peer relationships. We know social competence gets legs with structured, social-emotional learning programs offered in elementary school and is buttressed by more intensive social skills training for those who need extra support. We need a coordinated, all-out effort to eliminate disparities in outcomes across race and income groups. We would not stand by idly until a child becomes 18 and then throw that child in prison because he or she cannot read. Instead, we have created universal public schools, classroom curricula enhanced by targeted special education programs, as well as a culture of literacy development that begins at birth with books in the home, computer-assisted skills learning and more. But with social competence, we do very little, and then, indeed, we will throw an 18-year-old child in prison for acting incompetently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broad use of these programs to support children should be one part of a larger strategy that includes eliminating structural inequities, poor quality housing and other community resource limits experienced by many children and families. To make healthier communities, we need both effective programs for individual children and structural changes that reduce inequities. We propose an approach that supports children’s mental health and well-being from birth onward that focuses on the important aspects of a child’s life. The approach must help parents connect with their child in the first years of life. It must support high-quality universal early childcare and education experiences. It must re-craft schooling to incorporate social-emotional learning curricula and peer connections as central goals. It must include regular screening across the lifespan to identify those in greater need so that targeted interventions can support children. It must be integrated with traditional education to create synergies between learning to read and learning to get along. Engineering such a comprehensive approach requires collaboration across health and education sectors. The ball could get rolling through leadership from the executive branch and governors.Maybe, just maybe, a coordinated all-out effort to make the next generation of children socially competent could prevent violent tragedies like those we see today and promote a generation of healthy, productive and engaged citizens.Mark Greenberg is the founding director of the Edna Bennett Pierce Prevention Research Center and is emeritus professor at Penn State.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kenneth Dodge is the William McDougall distinguished professor of public policy and professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are researchers representing the Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The A’s announced that right-hander Brent Honeywell Jr. has been outrighted to Triple-A Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>Honeywell, 27, was drafted by the Rays in 2014 and spent years being considered one of the best prospects in the game. He cracked Baseball America’s top 100 list for five straight years from 2016 to 2020. He stayed on that list for so long both because of his talent and because repeated injuries prevented him from exhausting his prospect status.</p>\n<p>Honeywell required Tommy John surgery in early 2018, which wiped out that entire season. In June of 2019, he fractured a bone in his right elbow while working his way back to the mound, making it two straight lost seasons. In May of 2020, while the pandemic had put the season on pause, he underwent a decompression procedure on his right ulnar nerve. That eventually made it three consecutive campaigns without Honeywell taking the mound in an official game of any kind.</p>\n<p>In 2021, he finally was healthy enough to pitch, making his MLB debut for the Rays. They only let him throw 4 1/3 innings at the big league level, however, leaving him in Triple-A most of the year. He threw 81 2/3 frames there with a 3.97 ERA, 20% strikeout rate and 7.2% walk rate.</p>\n<p>Those weren’t eye-popping numbers, though it probably would have been unrealistic for Honeywell to just jump to ace-like results after three lost seasons. The A’s acquired him from the Rays in November, hoping that another healthy year could perhaps allow Honeywell to rediscover some of the form that made him such a hot prospect in previous years. Unfortunately, he was dealt another injury setback, diagnosed with an olecranon stress reaction in his elbow in March. That landed him on the 60-day IL to start the year, where he’s been until today. The club didn’t announce that Honeywell had been designated for assignment but they evidently passed him through waivers in recent days.</p>\n<p>Since he was on the 60-day IL, Honeywell wasn’t occupying a spot on the 40-man roster. He was about to, however, as he began a rehab assignment August 16. Rehab assignments for pitchers come with a 30-day maximum, meaning Honeywell was nearing his activation point. Instead, the A’s put him on waivers and passed him through. This is his first career outright and he has less than three years of MLB service time. He will stick with the A’s without retaking a spot on the roster. In 11 2/3 innings as part of his rehab, he logged an ERA of 8.49, though likely somewhat marred by a .405 BABIP. He’s struck out 19.3% of batters and walked 7% in that small sample.</p>",

        "description": "Mark Vientos | Photo by Rob Tringali/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Vientos will be called up today with Starling Marte being placed on the Injured List.</p> <p>Long before he was mashing home runs and making a name for himself as a professional, Mark Vientos was doing the same as a teenager, establishing his name on the exhibition and showcase circuit and earning praise from scouts and evaluators as early as 2013, when he was just 14 years old. For three years, he played ball at Charles W. Flanagan High School in Pembroke Pines, Florida, but in 2016, he switched schools and began attending American Heritage High School in Plantation, a few miles south. Vientos only appeared in 26 games for the American Heritage High School Patriots, missing some time in the spring due to a quad injury, but he made his time on the field count, hitting .417/.467/.523 with one home run and four stolen bases in six attempts. The 17-year-old was considered a borderline first-round talent, but the lost time from the quad injury coupled with his commitment to the University of Miami caused multiple teams to pass over him in the 2017 MLB Draft. The Mets were among the handful of teams that had scouted the teen, and with their second round pick, the 59th overall pick, they selected Vientos. The negotiations moved fairly quickly, and the two sides agreed to a $1.5 million signing bonus, slightly above the MLB-assigned slot value of $1,094,700. Very few young boys who grow up playing baseball get the opportunity to play baseball professionally, and even fewer still get to do so for the team they grew up rooting for. The son of a Dominican immigrant who left the island nation for New York City, Mark Vientos had his Mets fandom passed down from father-to-son. </p>\n<p>The Mets assigned Vientos to the GCL Mets to begin his professional career and he held his own as one of the youngest players in the league, hitting .259/.316/.397 in 47 games, earning a token promotion to the Kingsport Mets and the end of the season. That winter, Amazin’ Avenue ranked Vientos the Mets’ fifth-best prospect. He spent the entire 2018 season with Kingsport, and once again as one of the youngest players in the league, Vientos not only held his own but excelled, hitting .287/.389/.489 in 60 games for Kingsport, slugging 11 home runs, stealing 1 base in as many attempts, and walking 37 times to 43 strikeouts. That winter, I ranked Vientos the third-best player I saw that season, and Amazin’ Avenue ranked him the Mets’ third-best prospect.</p>\n<p>The Mets were aggressive with the third baseman in 2019, skipping him over the Short-A Brooklyn Cyclones and promoting him to the Low-A Columbia Fireflies, where he was the second youngest player in the South Atlantic League. While his season was a bit of a disappointment in terms of the expectations placed on him, Vientos did have a respectable year. All in all, he hit .255/.300/.411 in 111 games with 12 home runs, 1 stolen base in 5 attempts, and drawing 22 walks to 110 strikeouts. Most noteworthy about his season was how vast the difference was between the results from his first half and from his second half; in the first half of the season, Vientos hit .240/.286/.364 with 5 home runs and a 12:58 walk:strikeout ratio and in the second half hit .270/.315/.464 with 7 home runs and a 10:51 walk:strikeout ratio. Despite seeing him during literally his worst stretch of the season, I ranked Vientos the third-best player I saw that season, and Amazin’ Avenue ranked him the Mets’ fifth-best prospect.</p>\n<p>As was the case with everyone else, Vientos missed the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but he did get to play a bit unlike many others, getting invited to the Coney Island alternate site and impressing many in the organization. When minor league baseball returned in 2021 and Vientos was once again given a tough assignment, jumping from Low-A baseball to Double-A, getting assigned to the Binghamton Rumble Ponies. His 2021 season mirrored his 2019 season a great deal, in that he was the second-youngest player to play in the Eastern League, and that he once again struggled early on but hit his stride later in the season, eventually earning a promotion to Syracuse at the end of the season. On the whole, he hit .281/.352/.581 in 83 games total, 72 in Binghamton and 11 in Syracuse, with a combined 25 home runs and 33 walks to 100 strikeouts. Of note, he missed time in August and September due to MiLB health and safety protocols related to COVID-19. Over the winter, Amazin’ Avenue ranked the 21-year-old the Mets fourth-best prospect.</p>\n<p>The Mets assigned Vientos to the Triple-A Syracuse Mets to begin the season, and for a third year in a row, he started his year off cold but got hotter and hotter as the season went on. In 19 games in April, he hit .164/.257/.312 with 1 home run, 7 walks, and 21 strikeouts. In 18 games in May, he hit .328/.408/.642 with 6 home runs, 8 walks, and 25 strikeouts. In 17 games in June, he hit .242/.375/.515 with 6 home runs, 13 walks, and 24 strikeouts. In 21 games in July, he hit .317/.353/.595 with 6 home runs, 5 walks, and 21 strikeouts. In 19 games in August, he hit .338/.400/.558 with 4 home runs, 8 walks, and 18 strikeouts. Through 7 games in September prior to his call-up, Vientos hit .250/.323/.357 with 1 home run, 3 walks, and 9 home runs.</p>\n<p>Vientos stands upright and has wide stance at the plate, holding his hands high and wrapping his bat behind his head. He has a minimal load and swings with a toe tap and/or small leg kick. When he makes solid contact, the ball explodes off his bat, a combination of his bat speed, the natural loft from his swing, and torque from utilizing his lower half effectively. His swing gets long and shows susceptibility to premium stuff thrown inside, though he has great pull power and can really punish inside pitches when he is able to get ahold of them. He shows power back up the middle and to the opposite field as well, perhaps a biproduct of his apparent guess strategy. Throughout his career, Vientos has shown vulnerability to breaking balls and pitches thrown down-and-away, but when he accurate predicts these pitches, he is able to really put a jolt on the ball and post 100 MPH+ exit velocities to all fields, particularly to the opposite field.</p>\n<p>Though initially drafted as a shortstop, Vientos does not have the ability to play up the middle. He was moved to third base in 2018, and at the present is stretched even there. While not unathletic, Vientos is a low-energy guy that lacks explosive quick twitch muscle, resulting in a slow first step and below-average lateral quickness. His average-to-above-average arm and solid instincts allowed him to handle the routine plays fine at third fine initially, but the pace of the game increased as he worked his way up the minor league ladder, and Vientos is a well-below-average defender at third base as a professional at the highest level. He played limited innings in the outfield in 2021 as the Mets explored the best way to give both him and Brett Baty playing time, but the experiment ended and was not resumed in 2022; while there is enough data to make any conclusive, definitive remarks about his ability there, based on how he looked visually along with the fact that he has not played in the outfield at all in 2022, it is safe to conclude that the experiment will not be resumed again. Instead, the Mets actually have shifted Vientos down the defensive spectrum, giving him more play at first base and DH this season than ever before. </p>",

        "description": "Photo by Dustin Bradford/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>A sweep is a tall order as the Rockies play the Diamondbacks for the final time in 2022.</p> <p>Though some of your minds may be focused on the first Sunday of the NFL season, or seven hours of commercial free football, the Colorado Rockies have one singular focus. They must defeat Zac Gallen and the Arizona Diamondbacks and cement the sweep in their final matchup of the season.</p>\n<p>The Rockies sealed a season series win against the Diamondbacks last night with their 4-1 win and are riding high with a four game win streak, but the order today is significantly taller. They must conquer a pitcher they have had no answers for this season.</p>\n<p>Zac Gallen has emerged as a potential National League Cy Young candidate with his 2.42 ERA and 0.917 WHIP over 26 starts this season. He has pitched 41 1⁄3 consecutive scoreless innings coming into today’s ballgame on the back of his dangerous arsenal of well commanded pitches. His curveball has a whiff rate of 32.9%, and if that doesn’t get you his changeup will. In four starts and 25 innings against the Rockies this season he has a 2.52 ERA and a 0.920 WHIP. He’s struck out 24 batters and issued just six walks. He’s only given up two runs. The Rockies have struggled against the Arizona ace, but that will need to change today. The first order of business will be snapping that scoreless streak as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>The rookie Ryan Feltner will take the mound for the Rockies this afternoon as he continues to learn and look for his place in the future of the organization, Feltner has had an up-and-down season with a 5.85 ERA over 14 starts and 15 total appearances. In 11 of his 15 outings he’s given up at least one home run. However, he’s also starting to put the pieces together and might finally be tapping into his potential. His sinker is a thing of beauty and he’s being given the opportunity by manager Bud Black to start as many games as possible heading towards the season’s conclusion.</p>\n<p>First Pitch: 1:10 AM MDT</p>\n<p>TV: AT&amp;T Sports Net Rocky Mountain; MLB.tv</p>\n<p>Radio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM; KNRV 1150 (Spanish)</p>\n<p>Lineups:</p>\n\n\n<p>Game 139. pic.twitter.com/U5WHg6zBUx</p>— Arizona Diamondbacks (@Dbacks) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>#Rockies lineup against Zac Gallen: pic.twitter.com/3P0TMoL3pl</p>— Danielle Allentuck (@d_allentuck) September 11, 2022",

        "description": "<p>Toronto film festival: the director goes back to his childhood for an endearing, if overlong, film with an Oscar-tipped Michelle Williams as his mother</p><p>Steven Spielberg’s uncharacteristically personal drama The Fabelmans is a string of character-defining memories, rare insight into the world’s most famous director who has usually kept us at arm’s length. While his 30-plus movies have mostly traded in warmth and big, IMAX-sized emotion, there’s been an otherness, successfully synthetic (he’s a film-maker who rarely misses) but only allowing us a vague idea of who he is as a professional rather than a person.</p><p>His formative years are molded into something semi-fictionalised here – this is The Fabelmans, not the Spielbergs – but the vague details are roughly the same, the story of a boy discovering his love for film as his family splinters around him. We start with his first experience at the cinema, as Sammy, in terrified awe of The Greatest Show on Earth and then haunted by what he’s seen. Determined to recreate the train crash that has filled his nightmares, to control and understand his fear, he begins a journey of home movies, both encouraged by his parents while reminded that a hobby should only take over so much of his time. As he grows, we spend the majority of the film with his teenage self, played by an excellent Gabriel LaBelle, as he wrestles with his passion while grappling with the slow decay of his parents’ marriage, played by Paul Dano and Michelle Williams.</p><p>The Fabelmans is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released in the US on 11 November</p> Continue reading...",

And yet pre-release hype for James Cameron’s forthcoming sequel to the highest-grossing film of all time, Avatar: The Way of Water, has been bogged down with a general sense that we have seen this all before, that a return to the world of the N’avi is less exciting than it was in 2009, when Cameron’s fantasy epic seemed primed to usher in a whole new universe of stereoscopic film-making.</p><p>At Saturday’s D23 panel for Disney offshoots Marvel, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox, audiences were treated to the world’s first glimpse of actual footage from the movie itself. A giant Cameron – the film-maker is currently in New Zealand finishing the movie – gazed down from the big screens on an auditorium of 7,000 people at the Anaheim Convention Centre in Southern California, while cast members Zoe Saldana (Neytiri), Sam Worthington (Jake Sully), Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang talked about the new movie’s focus on the importance of family. Then the footage was unleashed, and all of a sudden we were reminded of exactly why Avatar made such a buzz in the first place: that glorious supercharge to the senses that comes from 3D film-making zooming above the stratosphere.</p> Continue reading...",

We just cannot allow Russia to continue the same occupation that they started back in 2014.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine has mounted a counteroffensive across the south and east in recent days, including in the southern region of Kherson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zelenskyy referred to Russia’s occupation as “cannibalism,” but said the source of Ukraine’s strength lies in its willingness to hold out. He met with host Zakaria in an outdoor walking interview, which Zakaria pointed to as significant, given the threats on Zelenskyy’s life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have no other way, and it’s not our weakness. I believe it’s our strength. Because Russia does have a way out. They can go back home. We have only this home to defend,” Zelenskyy said of his nation’s military efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The war stretched to its 200-day mark Sunday, following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion in February.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I would like to immediately state that I’m grateful to President Biden and the White House and the bipartisan support,” Zelenskyy told Zakaria, adding: “Without this support, we will not be able to return our lands.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>The mayor of Jackson, Miss., Chokwe Antar Lumumba (D), said on Sunday that federal infrastructure funding is “insufficient” to address \"30 years of deferred maintenance and accumulated challenges\" associated with the city's water system.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During an appearance on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” moderator Margaret Brennan noted that Jackson received $42 million from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) last year, adding that President Biden stressed during the signing of the bill the importance of preventing a reoccurrence of water crises in cities such as Jackson and Flint, Mich.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have committed the grand majority of our ARPA funds towards our infrastructure, not only at the water treatment facility, but distribution lines,” Lumumba told Brennan. “We've spent $8 million on one pipe alone to South Jackson, which is disproportionately affected. It is also critical for people to know that the city of Jackson didn't get $42 million at one time, merely a little over a month ago, we got our second tranche of the funds.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lumumba told Brennan that his administration is committing the \"overwhelming majority\" of the city's funding to address the current water crisis. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“However, it is insufficient to meet the great need of 30 years of deferred maintenance and accumulated challenges,\" he added. \"And so it will take a coordinated effort on not only the local state, but federal levels as well.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lumumba’s remarks come after Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R) declared a state of emergency last month for areas, including Jackson, that were hit by major flooding. The city's 150,000 residents were left without potable water to drink. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During a press conference last week, Reeves said that he is open to numerous long-term options in an effort to restore Jackson’s water system, noting that transferring the system to a private company is “on the table.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>A new book by former Trump aide Peter Navarro claims that the former president was supportive of an attempt to remove his son-in-law Jared Kushner from having control over his 2020 campaign and replace him with Stephen Bannon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Navarro in the book, obtained by The Guardian, describes the plan as a “coup d’état,” but the change never occurred because Kushner refused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And that was that. And the rest is a catastrophic strategic failure history,” Navarro wrote, according to The Guardian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Navarro, a critic of Kushner, will later this month release the book, titled “Taking Back Trump’s America: Why We Lost the White House and How We’ll Win It Back.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump, while supportive of the move, feared “family troubles if [he] himself had to deliver the bad news to … the father of his grandchildren,” so he did not bring up the subject with Kushner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, the president asked Home Depot founder Bernie Marcus, a prominent GOP donor, to tell Kushner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kushner at first skipped a call from Marcus and then later told him, “things were fine with the campaign, there was no way he was stepping down and, in effect, Bernie Marcus and his big moneybags could go pound sand,” according to Navarro's account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hill has reached out to a Trump spokesperson for comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Navarro has lashed out at Kushner in the past. After Kushner revealed in his book that he was treated for thyroid cancer while serving in the White House, Navarro said during a Newsmax interview that the revelation “came out of nowhere” and accused Kushner of trying to get “sympathy to try to sell his book.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Navarro has also come under scrutiny in recent months over his defiance of subpoenas issued by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A federal grand jury indicted Navarro this summer on two counts of criminal contempt of Congress. In court following his arrest, Navarro lashed out at Congress and federal law enforcement.Earlier that week, the former Trump trade adviser filed a civil complaint challenging the House panel’s authority, also revealing he received a grand jury subpoena as part of the Justice Department’s Jan. 6 investigation.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3636406-how-international-law-should-guide-post-roe-america/",
        "description": "<p>The abortion restriction free-for-all, set in motion by the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 2022 decision in Dobbs vs Jackson Women’s Health Organization, is now coming into focus. While some state laws protect abortion in ways compliant with, or beyond, Roe and Casey, over a dozen states now criminalize abortion with few, if any, exceptions. Some of these laws force people to remain pregnant whether those pregnancies are the result of rape or incest, or in cases where their own health or that of the fetus is endangered.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority opinion in Dobbs dubiously claimed that most countries in the world restricted abortion access after 12 weeks, making the U.S., under Roe and Casey, an outlier among nations. Dobbs, it would follow, restores the U.S. to its proper place in the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Supreme Court’s assumption could not be farther from the truth. Nations that restrict abortion after 12 weeks provide broad grounds for post-12-week terminations. And unlike several states in our country, in over 70 percent of countries, abortions are legal when a pregnant person’s health is at risk; over 60 percent when pregnancy is due to rape or incest, or in cases of fetal impairment.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>State laws that run afoul of this international consensus include Texas and Idaho, which only permit abortion when necessary to save a person’s life. Physicians have delayed necessary, life-preserving, care to patients experiencing miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies out of uncertainty about the laws and fear of criminal prosecutions or loss of their medical licenses. New abortion bans also place states at odds with their ethical obligations to “do no harm” and follow the established standard of care.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Biden administration has intervened to clarify the meaning and application of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), which arguably should supersede state abortion bans governing emergency situations. Two appellate courts have disagreed: a federal judge held that Texas law, not EMTALA, governed physician conduct (leaving them vulnerable to criminal prosecution) whereas a different federal court ruled that Idaho’s physicians could not be prosecuted for performing emergency abortions. Both decisions will surely be appealed to their respective federal circuit courts and then to the U.S. Supreme Court. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the limits to what states can do when it comes to abortion?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We should turn to international law to provide a national standard in the absence of our Constitution. The international human rights legal system consistently has brought countries to task for using criminal law to regulate abortion, as well as for passing laws that threaten the health and life of pregnant people. It has also induced countries such as Ireland to liberalize abortion access. While the U.S. often has seen itself as an outsider to international law, it is nonetheless part of this international system of nation-states.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. has signed and ratified three international human rights treaties: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention Against Torture. By signing and ratifying these treaties, the U.S. has assumed international duties in two ways. First, it has obligated its agencies, branches, national and sub-national jurisdictions (e.g. its 50 states) and territories to ensure its laws and policies do not violate the provisions articulated in those treaties. Second, treaties to which the U.S. is a party are considered “the supreme Law of the Land” under the U.S. Constitution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, the provisions of these international human rights treaties are part of U.S. federal law. All three of these treaties have been interpreted to limit state regulation of abortion.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rights to life and health are articulated in the foundational treaties comprising the “International Bill of Rights”— documents the United States played an influential role in drafting. In the context of abortion — these human rights treaties could not be clearer, as emphasized by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, interpreting the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: “[R]estrictions on the ability of women or girls to seek abortion must not, inter alia, jeopardize their lives, subject them to physical or mental pain or suffering.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite what the Supreme Court’s majority Dobbs opinion claims about the U.S.’s place in comparative abortion law, the laws of some states place our country on the periphery of what is internationally acceptable. If the U.S. does not change course, it will be the subject of international critique and sanction, as evidenced by the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination’s most recent comments regarding the effects of Dobbs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being out of compliance with human rights laws may not persuade those with anti-abortion beliefs to temper their legislative excesses that put lives at risk. But the rights to life and liberty guaranteed to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S. must not be conditioned upon a zip code. Up until this point, the starkness of the post-Dobbs U.S. in the global community has been underexplored and barely mentioned. But our federal government could position the United States as a human rights leader, using the leverage that international law provides.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dropping formal obstacles to the domestic application of international human rights will take political will and a dramatic change in course. The U.S. has maintained that treaty provisions are only legally enforceable after Congress passes implementing legislation — a step it has seldom taken, and its failure to do so has met international criticism. Congress, under pressure from the administration, could, of course, remove the reservations, understandings and declarations to U.N. human rights treaties that hamstring treaties’ application and make it a priority to pass implementing legislation so that it would make real its human rights obligations.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even without such additional legislation, there is a normative force to the obligations the U.S. assumed as a member of the international community. Beyond those long-term measures, as a blueprint for advocacy, the language of human rights provides legitimacy and solidarity for the kind of social movement action that fosters political change. Post-Dobbs advocacy needs to reflect new strategies and build new solidarities; the international human rights system could provide some direction to those efforts.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel Rebouché is the interim dean of Temple University’s Beasley School of Law and the James E.

        "description": "<p>Over the past six days, Ukraine’s armed forces have broken through the Russian lines in the northeastern corner of the country, swept eastward, and liberated town after town in what had been occupied territory. First Balakliya, then Kupyansk, then Izium, a city that sits on major supply routes. These names won’t mean much to a foreign audience, but they are places that have been beyond reach, impossible for Ukrainians to contact for months. Now they have fallen in hours. As I write this, Ukrainian forces are said to be fighting on the outskirts of Donetsk, a city that Russia has occupied since 2014.</p><p>[Phillips Payson O’Brien: Ukraine is waging a new kind of war]</p><p>Many things about this advance are unexpected, especially the location: For many weeks, the Ukrainians loudly telegraphed their intention to launch a major offensive farther south. The biggest shock is not Ukraine’s tactics but Russia’s response. “What really surprises us,” Lieutenant General Yevhen Moisiuk, the deputy commander in chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, told me in Kyiv yesterday morning, “is that the Russian troops are not fighting back.”</p><p>Russian troops are not fighting back. More than that: Offered the choice of fighting or fleeing, many of them appear to be escaping as fast as they can. For several days, soldiers and others have posted photographs of hastily abandoned military vehicles and equipment, as well as videos showing lines of cars, presumably belonging to collaborators, fleeing the occupied territories. A Ukrainian General Staff report said that Russian soldiers were ditching their uniforms, donning civilian clothes, and trying to slip back into Russian territory. The Ukrainian security service has set up a hotline that Russian soldiers can call if they want to surrender, and it has also posted recordings of some of the calls. The fundamental difference between Ukrainian soldiers, who are fighting for their country’s existence, and Russian soldiers, who are fighting for their salary, has finally begun to matter.   </p><p>That difference might not suffice, of course. Ukrainian soldiers may be better motivated, but the Russians still have far larger stores of weapons and ammunition. They can still inflict misery on civilians, as they did in today’s apparent attack on the electrical grid in Kharkiv and elsewhere in eastern Ukraine. Many other cruel options—horrific options—are still open even to a Russia whose soldiers will not fight. The nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia remains inside the battle zone. Russia’s propagandists have been talking about nuclear weapons since the beginning of the war. Although Russian troops are not fighting in the north, they are still resisting the Ukrainian offensive in the south.</p><p>But even though the fighting may still take many turns, the events of the past few days should force Ukraine’s allies to stop and think. A new reality has been created: The Ukrainians could win this war. Are we in the West really prepared for a Ukrainian victory? Do we know what other changes it could bring?</p><p>Back in March, I wrote that it was time to imagine the possibility of victory, and I defined victory quite narrowly: “It means that Ukraine remains a sovereign democracy, with the right to choose its own leaders and make its own treaties.” Six months later, some adjustments to that basic definition are required. In Kyiv yesterday, I watched Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov tell an audience that victory should now include not only a return to the borders of Ukraine as they were in 1991—including Crimea, as well as Donbas in eastern Ukraine—but also reparations to pay for the damage and war-crimes tribunals to give victims some sense of justice.</p><p>These demands are not in any sense outrageous or extreme. This was never just a war for territory, after all, but rather a campaign fought with genocidal intent. Russian forces in occupied territories have tortured and murdered civilians, arrested and deported hundreds of thousands of people, destroyed theaters, museums, schools, hospitals. Bombing raids on Ukrainian cities far from the front line have slaughtered civilians and cost Ukraine billions in property damage. Returning the land will not, by itself, compensate Ukrainians for this catastrophic invasion.   </p><p>[George Packer: Ukrainians are defending the values that Americans claim to hold]</p><p>But even if it is justified, the Ukrainian definition of victory remains extraordinarily ambitious. To put it bluntly: It is hard to imagine how Russia can meet any of these demands—territorial, financial, legal—so long as its current president remains in power. Remember, Vladimir Putin has put the destruction of Ukraine at the very center of his foreign and domestic policies, and at the heart of what he wants his legacy to be. Two days after the launch of the failed invasion of Kyiv, the Russian state-news agency accidentally published, and then retracted, an article prematurely declaring success. “Russia,” it declared, “is restoring its unity.” The dissolution of the U.S.S.R.—the “tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history”—had been overcome. A “new era” had begun.</p><p>That original mission has already failed. There will be no such “new era.” The Soviet Union will not be revived. And when Russian elites finally realize that Putin’s imperial project was not just a failure for Putin personally but also a moral, political, and economic disaster for the entire country, themselves included, then his claim to be the legitimate ruler of Russia melts away. When I write that Americans and Europeans need to prepare for a Ukrainian victory, this is what I mean: We must expect that a Ukrainian victory, and certainly a victory in Ukraine’s understanding of the term, also brings about the end of Putin’s regime.</p><p>To be clear: This is not a prediction; it’s a warning. Many things about the current Russian political system are strange, and one of the strangest is the total absence of a mechanism for succession. Not only do we have no idea who would or could replace Putin; we have no idea who would or could choose that person. In the Soviet Union there was a Politburo, a group of people that could theoretically make such a decision, and very occasionally did. By contrast, there is no transition mechanism in Russia. There is no dauphin. Putin has refused even to allow Russians to contemplate an alternative to his seedy and corrupt brand of kleptocratic power. Nevertheless, I repeat: It is inconceivable that he can continue to rule if the centerpiece of his claim to legitimacy—his promise to put the Soviet Union back together again—proves not just impossible but laughable.</p><p>To prepare for Putin’s exit does not mean that Americans, Europeans, or any outsiders intervene directly in the politics of Moscow. We have no tools that can affect the course of events in the Kremlin, and any effort to meddle would certainly backfire. But that doesn’t mean we should help him stay in power either. As Western heads of state, foreign ministers, and generals think about how to end this war, they should not try to preserve Putin’s view of himself or of the world, his backward-looking definition of Russian greatness. They should not be planning to negotiate on his terms at all, because they might be dealing with someone else altogether.</p><p>[Anne Applebaum: ‘Lukashenko is easier to unseat than Putin’]</p><p>Even if they prove ephemeral, the events of the past few days do change the nature of this war. From the very beginning, everybody—Europeans, Americans, the global business community in particular—has wanted a return to stability. But the path to stability in Ukraine, long-lasting stability, has been hard to see. After all, any cease-fire imposed too early could be treated, by Moscow, as an opportunity to rearm. Any offer to negotiate could be understood, in Moscow, as a sign of weakness. But now is the time to ask about the stability of Russia itself and to factor that question into our plans. Russian soldiers are running away, ditching their equipment, asking to surrender. How long do we have to wait until the men in Putin’s inner circle do the same?</p><p>The possibility of instability in Russia, a nuclear power, terrifies many. But it may now be unavoidable. And if that’s what is coming, we should anticipate it, plan for it, think about the possibilities as well as the dangers. “We have learned not to be scared,” Reznikov told his Kyiv audience on Saturday. “Now we ask the rest of you not to be scared too.”</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/3637154-religion-and-samuel-alitos-time-bomb/",
        "description": "<p>An irresponsible sentence that Justice Samuel Alito wrote eight years ago may now excuse religious people from nearly every legal obligation they have, so long as a hypothetical, nonexistent government program could substitute for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That became clear this week when Judge Reed O’Connor declared in Braidwood Management v. Becerra that employers with religious objections may offer health plans without drugs that prevent transmission of HIV, contraception, the HPV vaccine and screenings and behavioral counseling for STDs and drug use. The employers claim that providing such coverage makes them complicit in homosexual behavior, drug use and sexual activity outside of marriage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plaintiffs obviously were shopping for a favorable judge when they brought their case to O’Connor, who has repeatedly stretched the law in ways that disrupt ObamaCare. Here, however, his extravagant conclusion may well be sustained by the Supreme Court, which has embraced an increasingly extreme account of religious liberty. (He also hamstrung the statute in a different way, involving the administrative capacities of agencies, as Ian Millhiser has explained.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand what just happened, it is necessary to look back to a 2014 Supreme Court decision, Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores. There the court allowed a for-profit corporation with religious owners to deny contraceptive coverage to its employees. The court relied on the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which exempts religious objectors to federal law unless the burden on them is necessary to a compelling government interest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was already an accommodation for religious nonprofits, which used an alternative mechanism to guarantee workers the disputed coverage. If that program were extended to Hobby Lobby Stores, Justice Alito wrote for the court, the impact on its employees would be “precisely zero.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Alito did not stop there. His opinion mused that the “most straightforward way” of providing coverage “would be for the Government to assume the cost of providing the four contraceptives at issue to any women who are unable to obtain them under their health-insurance policies due to their employers’ religious objections.” He rejected the Obama administration’s claim that “RFRA cannot be used to require creation of entirely new programs.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The court split 5-4, and the swing vote, Justice Anthony Kennedy, declared that he was skeptical about the “imposition of a whole new program or burden on the Government.”  In Hobby Lobby, he declared, there happened to be “an existing, recognized, workable, and already-implemented framework” for accommodating the religious objection. This fact “might well suffice to distinguish the instant cases from many others in which it is more difficult and expensive to accommodate a governmental program to countless religious claims based on an alleged statutory right of free exercise.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Justice Ginsburg, dissenting, was similarly skeptical: “[W]here is the stopping point to the ‘let the government pay’ alternative? Suppose an employer's sincerely held religious belief is offended by health coverage of vaccines, or paying the minimum wage, or according women equal pay for substantially similar work?” She might have enumerated other costly mandates, such as landlords’ obligations to keep premises safe, or employers’ duty to purchase expensive safety equipment. And what about religious people who object to paying taxes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kennedy has since retired, replaced by Neil Gorsuch, who has never voted to deny any religiously based claim. He is willing to expose frail patients to COVID-19 for the sake of religious liberty. Alito now proposes, on the basis of weak originalist evidence, to constitutionalize RFRA and require religious exemptions for all laws, state and federal alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alito’s dictum was the basis for Judge O’Connor’s decision last week. Quoting “Hobby Lobby,” O’Connor wrote that the Biden administration had not “shown that the government would be unable to assume the cost of providing [HIV preventive] drugs to those who are unable to obtain them due to their employers’ religious objections.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was that. With this one sentence, the employees’ coverage disappeared.  Gone are Kennedy’s concerns about the difficulty and expense of demanding entire new programs. Or the certainty that those programs will not in fact ever be enacted, so that the employees must simply do without. And a majority of the new, extremely conservative court appears likely to agree with Alito.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve focused at length on what Alito wrote in Hobby Lobby because O’Connor’s decision shows that it was a time bomb, one now in the process of exploding. It is available in any case where any obligation could imaginably be fulfilled by the government. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ginsburg was right that there is no stopping point. Perhaps emergency rooms in religious hospitals can turn away women hemorrhaging from failed pregnancies, because government could always build emergency rooms of its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is today a serious danger to religious liberty. But it is coming from the Supreme Court, which has been construing it to mean a right to hurt people. If this is now its authoritative meaning, then the longstanding, broad consensus that supported it will collapse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrew Koppelman, John Paul Stevens Professor of Law at Northwestern University, is the author of “Burning Down the House: How Libertarian Philosophy Was Corrupted by Delusion and Greed” (St. Martin’s Press, forthcoming).

        "description": "<p>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Sunday said the threats facing the U.S. in the 21 years since the Sept. 11 attacks have shifted from worries about foreign terrorists to growing concerns about domestic extremism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The threat landscape has evolved considerably over the last 20 years,” Mayorkas said during an appearance on MSNBC's “The Sunday Show with Jonathan Capehart.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Back when 9/11 occurred, in those years we were very focused on the foreign terrorist, the individual who sought to do a severe harm to enter the United States and and do us harm,” Mayorkas continued, speaking at the site of the World Trade Center.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, Mayorkas said officials are becoming “more and more” concerned about U.S. residents radicalized by foreign terrorist ideologies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are seeing an emerging threat, of course, over the last several years of the domestic violent extremist,” Mayorkas said. “The individual here in the United States radicalized to violence by a foreign terrorist ideology, but also an ideology of hate, anti-government sentiment, false narratives propagated on online platforms, even personal grievances.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mayorkas has previously called domestic extremism the country’s greatest terror-related threat, comments that came less than three months after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mayorkas is one of many Democrats who have sounded alarm bells about domestic extremist threats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vice President Harris in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” which also aired on Sunday, called domestic terrorism “very dangerous,” saying it makes the country “weaker.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked if domestic threats are equal or greater than those the U.S. faced after 9/11 from foreign terrorists, Harris said “we don’t compare the two in the oath” to protect the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, said on Sunday that he worries about domestic threats while the threat of terror in his view had “diminished.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The stunning thing to me is here we are 20 years later, and the attack on the symbol of our democracy was not coming from terrorists, but it came from literally insurgents attacking the Capitol on Jan. 6,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”The House in May passed a bill nearly along party lines that would create domestic terrorism offices throughout the federal government. Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) was the sole House Republican to vote in favor of the legislation, while others in his conference argued the bill would unfairly target Americans.</p>",

        "description": "<p>On the morning of Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2001, our nation and the world were forever changed. That day, nearly 3,000 innocent people lost their lives, and we were plunged into a war that would define the next two decades of American foreign policy. Much has happened in the 21 years since the Sept. 11 terror attacks, but as we reflect on the fear, sadness, and uncertainty every American felt that day, so too should we remember our collective resolve to come together and support one another. On that day, and in the weeks and months after, Americans from all walks of life stood side-by-side in common purpose.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is this common purpose that we—a Nebraska Republican and California Democrat—try to uphold every day. As an Air Force veteran and Marine Corps veteran respectively, public service has always been a guiding principle for our careers. It is what prompted us to join the military and what drives us to serve our constituents and the nation today. Working together as chair and vice chair of the For Country Caucus, a bipartisan group of military veterans, we are committed to bringing together members from across party lines to improve the lives of our citizens here at home and strengthen U.S. policy abroad. We are proud of the work and the mission of the caucus—veterans in Congress are uniquely positioned to put our country ahead of rigid political ideology. It is how we operated in uniform, and we carry these principles with us to the halls of the Capitol today. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you do not need to join the military or run for Congress to serve your country. Acts of service in your local communities can be just as impactful. That’s why we are proud to support AmeriCorps’ 9/11 Day of Service initiative to encourage the next generation of leaders to be active in their communities. No matter how small a deed, 9/11 Day of Service is an opportunity to help your neighbors while honoring first responders and all those who were lost that day. Whether you are volunteering at the local soup kitchen, creating care boxes for currently deployed servicemembers, or assembling emergency preparedness kits for families in need, service to your community strengthens the bond between strangers, fosters greater civic engagement, and lifts up the vulnerable. We can think of few better ways to memorialize the victims of 9/11 than to spend the day in service to others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, on the 21st anniversary of 9/11, let us remember the lives lost, commemorate the first responders, and recommit ourselves to each other as we did in the aftermath of that fateful day. We should not need a crisis for Americans to find common ground. Through programs like AmeriCorps’ 9/11 Day of Service, every American can give thanks, give back, and build a better community in service to each other. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Representative Don Bacon is a retired Air Force General and Republican representing Nebraksa’s Second District.

        "description": "<p>I’ve spent much of the summer developing a new course for undergraduate students at UMass, titled “The Digital Public Sphere”. One of my three department chairs challenged me to build a class that would be compelling to undergraduates, could be taught as a large lecture class and could serve as an intro to “whatever it is that you do”. It’s an “experimental” class at UMass this semester, with the hope of scaling it up in the coming year. (I will post the syllabus, but not quite yet – I’m still tinkering with some of the late semester classes.)</p>\n<p>As I thought through the hundreds of ideas I wanted to share over the course of twenty-something lectures, I’ve centered on three core concepts I want to try and get across. The first is simple: democracy requires a robust and healthy public sphere, and American democracy was designed with that public sphere as a core component. </p>\n<p>Second – and this one has taken me more time to understand – the public sphere includes at least three components: a way of knowing what’s going on in the world (news), a space for discussing public life, and whatever precursors allow individuals to participate in these discussions. For Habermas’s public sphere, those precursors included being male, wealthy, white, urban and literate… hence the need for Nancy Fraser’s recognition of subaltern counterpublics. Public schooling and libraries are anchored in the idea of enabling people to participate in the public sphere.</p>\n<p>The third idea is that as technology and economic models change, all three of these components – the nature of news, discourse, and access – change as well. The obvious change we’re focused on is the displacement of a broadcast public sphere by a highly participatory digital public sphere, but we can see previous moments of upheaval: the rise of mass media with the penny press, the rise of propaganda as broadcast media puts increased control of the public sphere in the hands of corporations and governments.</p>\n<p>These moments of transition always involve tradeoffs. Broadcast models of the public sphere could reach broader audiences than those based on print, but broadcast concentrated discursive power in the hands of the wealthy and powerful, and made it much harder for individuals to challenge dominant narratives. A shift away from broadcast towards participatory media has similarly brought about tradeoffs. Many people are deeply disconcerted by a public sphere in which gatekeepers are less powerful, speech is less controlled, and mis/disinformation plays a larger part in our information ecosystem. This is a reasonable set of concerns: without a shared set of facts about COVID, climate change or the 2020 US elections, it’s hard to imagine meaningful deliberation in the public sphere.</p>\n<p>It’s worth remembering that recent information disorder has an interesting and directly related upside: a massive diversification of points of view expressed within media. There’s been a fascinating illustration of this phenomenon in the past week, in reactions to the death of Queen Elizabeth II.</p>\n<p>“the chief monarch of a thieving raping genocidal empire”. Twitter removed the comment, her university condemned her statement, and thousands of social media users – including Jeff Bezos – lined up to criticize her reaction.</p>\n<p>It’s worth offering some context for Dr. Anya’s harsh words. Dr. Anya’s parents were survivors of the Biafran war, a brutal conflict in which Igbo Nigerians sought an independent state, reacting to religious violence that killed thousands of Igbo living in northern parts of Nigeria. The Biafran separatists were defeated by Nigerian forces, supported and armed in part by the United Kingdom. Referring to this past, Dr. Anja explained:</p>\n\n<p>If anyone expects me to express anything but disdain for the monarch who supervised a government that sponsored the genocide that massacred and displaced half my family and the consequences of which those alive today are still trying to overcome, you can keep wishing upon a star.</p>\n<p>— Uju Anya (@UjuAnya) September 8, 2022</p>\n<p>  </p>\n<p>I don’t know enough about Britain’s role in the Biafran war to evaluate whether I agree with Dr. Anya’s characterizations. What I do know is that my undergrad students, mostly white kids from eastern MA, had an excellent discussion in class on Friday about the legacy of colonialism and the power of counterspeech. Questions about whether it’s disrespectful to use the moment of a monarch’s death to remind the world about colonialism and its legacies sound a bit like complaints that discussing gun control after a massacre is “politicizing” an event. Unfortunately, we don’t discuss gun control in the US, except in the wake of shootings. And unfortunately, we don’t spend much time talking about the legacies of colonialism and their lasting impacts on postcolonial nations like Nigeria.</p>\n<p>In the age of participatory media, a predictable event like Queen Elizabeth’s death has at least three acts. There’s the pre-ordained reactions, the obituaries written years before they needed to run, the reactions from world leaders and luminaries. In the second act, there’s a set of unanticipated reactions to a news event, as people who weren’t booked years in advance take advantage of the event to promote narratives they feel are important, hooking an oped to the news hook, or using the historical moment to remind people of an underexplored chapter of history. And then there’s a third wave, in which we debate whether or not speech in the second wave is acceptable in a democratic society. Karen Attiah, in a column in the Washington Post, does a good job of explaining why writers like Dr. Anya seize the moment in wave two, and defending plurality in the wave 3 discussions:</p>\n<p>“It shouldn’t take the death of a monarch to bring this colonial history to light, but this is where we are. The public relations imagery of a dedicated, elderly grandmother devoted to her corgis, and the Hollywood-ification of the royal family, serves all too well to blunt questions about empire. When the opportunity comes to surface truth, it must be seized.”</p>\n<p>This three-act structure –  a dominant narrative, subaltern narratives and a debate about the role of dialog itself – is a reminder that we’re in transition between an older vision of the public sphere and a newer one. I suspect that we will begin to anticipate both the counternarratives that social media will surface regarding events as they unfold, and anticipate unexpected reactions that will gain traction and attention. Over time, the third act – in which we fight over what we’re allowed to say – may dissipate. </p>\n<p>For now, I find myself wondering how much of the panic about mis- and disinformation is a reaction to the airing of narratives many of us are uncomfortable hearing articulated. I agree that American democracy is going to have a hard time navigating a period of time in which many people believe false things about the 2020 election. At the same time, I note that interest in information disorder began to rise in the wake of the 2016 election, when many Americans – myself included – were forced to conclude that many of our fellow citizens were sufficiently alienated from our political system that blowing up government as usual seemed like a worthwhile path. </p>\n<p>Jay Rosen observed that those who find their views outside the “sphere of legitimate debate” (as theorized by communication scholar Daniel Hallin) will “will experience the press as an opponent in the struggle for recognition.  If you don’t think separation of church and state is such a good idea; if you do think a single payer system is the way to go; if you dissent from the ‘lockstep behavior of both major American political parties when it comes to Israel’ (Glenn Greenwald) chances are you will never find your views reflected in the news. It’s not that there’s a one-sided debate; there’s no debate.”</p>\n<p>Social media means there’s _always_ debate, including debate about whether or not something should be up for debate. The interesting conversations have expanded beyond “How should we talk about a particular issue?” to “What perspectives can we discuss about a particular issue and still live within a democratic society?” It seems clear that we can talk about the Mau Mau rebellion and the Biafran war while mourning (or not) Queen Elizabeth’s death. What’s less clear is whether perspectives that deny others’ basic humanity – white supremacy, for example – push the capabilities of this new, pluralistic media sphere to their limits.</p>\n<p>The post The Monarchy, the Subaltern and the Public Sphere appeared first on Ethan Zuckerman.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Ukraine’s rout of the Russian army in the northeastern region of Kharkiv presents President Vladimir Putin with a political as well as military headache. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kremlin’s efforts to create a glowing propaganda narrative about its war in Ukraine are in tatters, as popular loyalist bloggers, think-tankers and even politicians start to ask uncomfortable questions about the defeat on the front lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, their anger is aimed exclusively at Russia’s senior military command, but Putin still needs to proceed with caution in the face of this unusual crackle of dissent. If he fails to react to the complaints against his commanders, political pressure could mount on his autocratic regime.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Sunday, Ramzan Kadyrov, the maverick and authoritarian leader of Russia’s Chechen Republic, accused Moscow’s military command of “mistakes” in the Kharkiv region, where Russian troops were hastily withdrawn from the strategically important town of Izyum and Kupiansk, a major railway junction near the border with Russia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Unless there are changes in the strategy for conducting the special military operation today or tomorrow, I will have to go to the leadership of the defense ministry, to the country’s leadership to explain the real situation on the ground,” he said in a recorded voice statement, published on his Telegram channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kadyrov’s own soldiers have a dire reputation, accused by the Ukrainians of war crimes in the town of Bucha early in the war and of making staged TikTok videos to promote their fabricated heroics, but the Chechen leader is significant because he is personally loyal to Putin and has proved his willingness to commit forces to the war. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is the highest level figure to openly slam the country’s top brass, but he’s far from alone.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sergei Markov, a Kremlin-connected political analyst and former parliamentarian with presidential ruling United Russia party, slammed Moscow’s anniversary celebrations on Saturday, during which Putin somewhat surreally inaugurated a new giant Ferris wheel before a night-time fireworks display, just as news of Ukrainian victories was spreading quickly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The celebrations now look like a political mistake. An equivalent of a feast in time of plague. It is clear that they [the Moscow authorities] did not want to cancel them, in order not to cause panic,” said the politician, who in previous years vigorously backed the separatist movement in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. “But the participation of the president speaks even more about the confusion of the authorities.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also said that the fireworks in Moscow “on the tragic day of a heavy military defeat for Russia” should have been canceled by the authorities, pointing to possible harm to Putin’s reputation in the eyes of his electorate. “The government should not celebrate when people are grieving.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sergei Mironov, leader of the A Just Russia party, which backs the Kremlin, cautiously joined the criticism of the celebration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He urged the Moscow authorities “to postpone” fireworks “until victory” over Ukraine. “This will be respectful of those who on this day, with weapons in their hands, risking their lives, defend all of Russia, all of its inhabitants thousands of kilometers away from their homes.”</p>\n\n\n\nDestroyed armored vehicles litter the road in Balakliya, Kharkiv region | Juan Barreto/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the anger of many Russian military bloggers was leveled against the clumsy information tactics of the Russian defense ministry, which refrained from making any comments on the situation in the Kharkiv region over the first days of Ukraine’s counteroffensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloggers also heavily criticized the Russian authorities for their inability to ensure a proper withdrawal from the Kharkiv region of those residents who backed the Russian occupation, and wanted to leave the region for Russia before the swift advance of Ukrainian troops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alexei Chadayev, a political think-tanker loyal to the Kremlin, believes that the Russian army “as a whole, as a structure, in its current form — to put it mildly — has limited suitability for modern warfare.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The key defects lie not in the ability to gather manpower, supply, weapons, and not even in management as such, but in the level of strategic thinking, the quality of understanding of the rhythm and logic of the confrontation,” he said on Saturday, commenting on Russia’s rout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that the latest defeat of Russian troops “is becoming more and more reminiscent” of the disaster which the Soviet Union’s Red Army faced in almost exactly the same territory in World War II. It was here that the Germans launched Operation Fredericus, delivering a major blow to the Red Army which was encircled and lost some quarter of a million killed and wounded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We either fight or surrender, there is no third option. So let’s decide. But if you ask me, I’m in favor of fighting,” Chadayev added.</p>",

        "description": "<p>STOCKHOLM — Sweden’s right-wing opposition bloc narrowly led a general election late Sunday, according to reports from the country’s 6,578 polling stations, edging in front of the incumbent Social Democrat-led government after a tightly fought election campaign dominated by the issue of rising gang violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a nail-biting count, which initially favored the incumbent center-left government, opposition parties supporting center-right Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson to form a new government secured 176 of 349 seats in parliament. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Parties supporting incumbent Social Democrat Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson won 173 seats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The extremely narrow gap between the two sides — 0.9 percent points or around 50,000 votes — means postal votes and ballots from abroad could still decide the election, so a final result might not be available until Wednesday, Sweden’s election authority said. Neither side claimed victory on the night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But late on Sunday, Kristersson was in pole position to form a new government. While his Moderate Party slightly underperformed its allies the far-right Sweden Democrats (SD), with 19 percent and 20.7 percent of the votes respectively, Kristersson has been backed by the right-wing coalition — which also includes the Christian Democrats and Liberals — to be the next prime minister. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I want to thank all of you who voted for us with a hope for change,” Kristersson said. “We Moderates are ready to lead that change.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a historic development for Sweden, SD, which was ostracized for decades within Swedish politics because of its roots in neo-Nazi groups, now stands on the verge of real influence in Swedish politics for the first time, either within an eventual Kristersson government or as a support party to it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>SD leader Jimmie Åkesson said that if there is a power shift, SD will have a “central role.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For her part, incumbent Prime Minister Andersson said her Social Democrats had enjoyed a strong election, securing 30.5 percent support, making it the country’s biggest party. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is a great result and we have run a fantastic campaign,” she told supporters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Social Democrats have led the Swedish government for the past eight years, but an intense focus on gang criminality and immigration during the election campaign was seen as a challenge to a party whose strengths are traditionally welfare provision and workers’ rights. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In front of cheering supporters, Moderate leader Kristersson acknowledged the campaign between his Moderate Party and the Social Democrats had at times been tough, but called on the country to now come together to meet challenges ahead, including an ongoing application to join NATO and a looming six-month presidency of Council of the European Union, which Sweden is due to assume from January 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a result won’t be known before Wednesday, Kristersson said that if his political group maintains its advantage in the count, he stands ready to take over as prime minister.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am ready to do all I can to form a government for all of Sweden’s citizens,” Kristersson said. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Ten years ago millions of people from all over the world spoke out against a U.S. bill that would’ve allowed courts to take problematic domain names offline.</p>\n<p>When that SOPA law failed to pass, many internet users celebrated a victory for free speech. </p>\n<p>A decade later, Internet curation is still a hot topic. However, many people who rallied against SOPA are now calling for companies, individuals, and websites to be ‘canceled’ online. Apparently, viewpoints have changed quite a bit. </p>\n<p>There is no denying that the web is full of despicable content that deserves to be taken offline. But by whom and on what basis are unanswered questions. </p>\nCloudflare &amp; Kiwi Farms\n<p>Last week, Cloudflare took a stand. The company said that in order to shield itself from escalating removal demands, including plain censorship, it would no longer terminate customers without a court order. This was already the company’s policy, a policy it had deviated from twice by kicking out Daily Stormer and 8Chan. </p>\n<p>Cloudflare’s comments were triggered by increasing calls to terminate the account of the controversial Kiwi Farms site, which does indeed contain terrible content. Ironically, Cloudflare’s firm stance was defeated just days later, when it terminated the troublesome forum, citing death threats as the reason. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Other companies decided to take action as well. DDoS-Guard, for example, swiftly followed Cloudflare’s example after Kiwi Farms attempted to move there. In addition, Google appears to have intervened as it no longer shows Kiwi Farm’s domains in the top search results. Even the Internet Archive has purged its archives of the controversial site.</p>\n<p>Mission accomplished!?</p>\nPirate Bay is OK\n<p>The people who called on Cloudflare to boot out Kiwi Farms will be pleased. Without any court intervention, they got their desired result. This is something some of the largest Hollywood companies and record labels failed to do with The Pirate Bay; a site that still uses Cloudflare to this day, despite its founders receiving criminal convictions in Sweden. </p>\n<p>Kiwi Farms had plenty of deeply disturbing content but this is not an isolated incident. Cloudflare will receive more calls to kick out sites and this recent episode will be cited in court as well, where the company will have a harder time maintaining a content agnostic stance. </p>\nDomain Registrars, Registries &amp; ISPs\n<p>The challenges won’t stop at Cloudflare either. As noted earlier, Google appears to have demoted the domain already, although that’s not officially confirmed. But what about Bing and DuckDuckGo? What is their role? Should they voluntarily take action against problematic sites?</p>\n<p>We haven’t even mentioned the elephants in the room, including domain registrars and domain registries.

        "description": "<p>The Orioles announced that they have claimed catcher Cam Gallagher off waivers from the Padres and optioned him to Triple-A Norfolk. He was designated for assignment by the Friars on Friday. Right-handed pitcher Rico Garcia was designated for assignment in a corresponding move.</p>\n<p>Gallagher, 29, was drafted by the Royals and spent most of his career backing up Salvador Perez. On deadline day this year, he was sent to the Padres for Brent Rooker but the Friars kept him in the minors until designating him for assignment. He has a career batting line of .240/.302/.355 in 171 career games, all with KC.</p>\n<p>Defensively, he’s racked up 12 Defensive Runs Saved in that time, a fairly strong mark for what is barely over a full season of work. For context, only three MLB catchers have more than 12 DRS so far this season. His 171-game career has also resulted in a 10.2 FRM, which is the framing metric at FanGraphs. Jose Trevino is the only catcher who has posted an FRM higher than that this season.</p>\n<p>Due to his backup role, Gallagher has never played more than 48 games in a season, so it’s hard to say whether or not he could sustain those solid defensive numbers over a lengthier stretch. He may not have to though, as the O’s are likely considering him for a backup role behind rookie catcher Adley Rutschman. It was recently reported that the O’s are looking to add a backup catcher this offseason, which makes sense as Robinson Chirinos is a free agent this winter. It’s possible that this claim gives them a chance to cross that off their to-do list early, or at least provide them with a backup plan in the event they don’t find an offseason move to their liking.</p>\n<p>Garcia, 28, was signed by Baltimore to a minor league deal in the offseason and has logged just eight innings in the majors this year but has solid numbers in the minors. Through 41 frames on the farm the season, he has a 1.76 ERA with a 32.3% strikeout rate and 9.8% walk rate. He will still have one more option after this year and still has less than one year of MLB service time. If any team feels he can sustain those strong results from this season, they could put in a claim and retain his services at little cost.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Red Sox have released right-hander Hirokazu Sawamura, per Pete Abraham of the Boston Globe. Sawamura asked for his release to pursue other opportunities, according to Chris Cotillo of MassLive.</p>\n<p>Sawamura, 34, pitched in Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball for ten years before crossing the Pacific. He signed a two-year deal with the Red Sox prior to the 2021 season and had a solid debut that season. He threw 53 innings with a 3.06 ERA, 26.2% strikeout rate and 51.8% ground ball rate, though a very worrisome 13.7% walk rate.</p>\n<p>His performance took a bit of a downward turn here in 2022, however, with his ERA jumping up to 3.73 and his strikeout rate dropping to 18.1%. He was designated for assignment in August, later clearing waivers and being outrighted to Triple-A.</p>\n<p>Sawamura’s contract guaranteed him $3MM with a $1.2MM salary both last year and this year, as well as a $600K buyout on a club option for 2023. That club option came with $3MM base but a series of escalators based on the number of appearances Sawamura made. If the club declined their option, Sawamura would then have a player option that also had a value tied to appearances. He had already pitched enough to get the player option up to $1.9MM and would have made it an even $2MM with one more game before he was cut from the roster.</p>\n<p>When Sawamura was outrighted, it was reported that the option was still active. However, Sawamura will collect the $1MM buyout and head to free agency instead. He only made a single appearance in Triple-A between the outright and today’s release.</p>",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/how-to-switch-lock-screen-clock-styles",
        "description": "<p>Android 12 introduced a double-line clock on the lock screen that turned out to be a bit controversial as some users preferred the simpler, one-line design of the old clock. This new larger clock style appeared on the lock screen if there were no notifications and would revert back to the old one-line style if a notification came through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in one of the early Android 12L betas, a toggle was found that would make this two-line design optional which continued throughout the later betas as well. The same was found in the Android 13 betas, but as usual with beta builds, we weren’t sure if it would make it to the official Android 13 release.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld lock screen one-line clock style vs new two-line clock\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, it did. Android 13 came with this toggle which now makes it possible to use your desired clock style in the lock screen. Since Android 13 has yet to roll out to devices other than the Google Pixel phones, these instructions and screenshots below on how to use this are specific to the Pixel launcher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To toggle between the two clock styles, go to your device’s Settings, then scroll down to “Display.” In display settings, select “Lock screen,” then scroll down to “Double-line clock.” The setting for the double-line clock will be on my default, but here you can toggle this setting off to go back to the old style one-line clock.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just want the steps!\n​\n   Go to your device’s Settings\n   Scroll down to Display\n   Select Lock screen\n   Scroll down to Double-line clock and toggle the feature on or off",

Ross Cameron-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Cairo’s Boys are after their fifth straight win in today’s finale</p> <p>The Bears are opening their season at Soldier Field, and Tony La Russa is back with the White Sox, sans managerial duties. So, if you're here and you're excited about White Sox baseball, you're a real one. Thanks for enjoying the ride with us – you're among friends here.</p>\n\n\n<p> ⬇️Let’s go, @ChicagoBears! pic.twitter.com/c1RT5AUjRB</p>— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The White Sox are in Oakland this afternoon to wrap things up against the Athletics, whom they have outscored 29-7 over the first three games. The South Siders are 9-3 during interim manager Miguel Cairo's reign and have clawed their way to 1 1⁄2 games behind the first-place Cleveland Guardians. It looks like this season might go down to the wire.</p>\n<p>On the bump for the White Sox today is Johnny Cueto, who rides his majestic steed into today's action with a 7-7 record 2.87 ERA. The last time Cueto saw the A's, he went seven solid innings but left with a no-decision. Then again, that was back when the White Sox were only allowed to hit singles, so I'm hoping Cueto's record will fare a little better today.</p>\n<p>Not faring well today is Josh Harrison, who was a late scratch due to flu-like symptoms. (Get well soon, Josh!) Luis Robert remains on the phantom IL today, having not played since getting hit by a pitch in the hand in Seattle. Our Elizabeth Gonzales has seen La Pantera taking (two-handed!) batting practice in Oakland, so maybe he will play again in 2022.</p>\n\n\n<p>Lineup change: García for Harrison, straight up. Harrison has been scratched with flu-like symptoms.</p>— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Oakland lines up like this:</p>\n\n\n<p>Sunday starters⚾: 1:07pm PT vs. White Sox : NBCSCA : Bloomberg 960 AM : https://t.co/M834H8sLrm : https://t.co/sssl73aCEn Starting pitcher: Irvin pic.twitter.com/Z9our7Y628</p>— Oakland A's (@Athletics) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>You can catch the game locally starting at 3:07 pm CT in the usual places. Let’s go get a sweep!</p>",

An oblivious toddler chattered into the silence on Ballater main street, where the country’s longest-serving monarch shopped for barbecue sausages at the local butcher.</p><p>It was a typically Highland farewell to the woman those lining the village streets considered a treasured neighbour: deeply felt but understated in its expression. There was no applause, no spontaneous chorus of anthem or hymn as the coffin passed by sedately and all eyes were pulled to the east to follow it beyond sight. Then, as though released from trance, the bystanders turned to nod to friends and disperse promptly, leaving behind the metal crowd barriers, taking home the weight of their loss.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p>While watching the Ubisoft Forward event which took place yesterday (yes, Stadia was taken off of the Assassin’s Creed Mirage blog post for some reason), I saw an advertisement for something called Mythic Quest. Some of you may have already heard of this awesome show about a fake game studio making a fake game, but I hadn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Googling the show and subsequently its cast, I discovered on one of my accounts that the knowledge graph for Google Search is displayed in an entirely new format. In fact, it displayed in Material Design! Check it out below – each segment relating to the actor in question shows in a colorful box with rounded corners.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In typical Material Design 2 fashion, Google is using a gradient background as a backdrop to each of the “cards”, all of which show the actor’s spouse, height, biography, and related pictures or videos. The standard “smart chips” still appear above this graph, showing movies and TV shows he has worked on, as well as the overview you see above, news related to him, and videos and interviews he appears in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you search for your favorite celebrity or really anything, you’ll find that your knowledge graph panel looks quite plain, and this is in fact a new design. I’m not sure if it’s being A/B tested, or if I just got lucky and encountered it before others, but it is pretty slick, wouldn’t you say?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the old design, and it’s look very 2021 Google with plain text, hyperlinks, and simple separators for each bit of information. Let me know what you think in the comments below about the new Material Design (or is it Material You?) knowledge graph panel. I wonder what will get the “Google touch” next!</p>\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "<p>Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) on Sunday dismissed concerns about the quality of Republican candidates for Senate as a number of candidates in key swing states backed by former President Trump struggle to create separation from their Democratic opponents. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The players are on the field. They’re eight weeks away, which is kind of like saying we’re in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter. So, the truth is, who we have on the field is who we’re going to play,” Scott said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m excited about the candidates that we have overall, because I do believe it gives us opportunity to win back the majority and to return sanity in Washington, which will reverberate around the country.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) last month said Republicans have a better chance of retaking the House than they do the Senate, due in part to “candidate quality,” a comment seen as a jab at Trump-backed candidates like Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, Herschel Walker in Georgia and J.D. Vance in Ohio. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fox News host Sean Hannity slammed McConnell for the remarks, saying he was leaving candidates “out to dry and fend for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A week later, McConnell hosted a fundraiser for Oz, Walker and Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.), who is running for Senate in North Carolina, and said the trio of candidates each have a “good chance of winning.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Rick Scott (Fla.) in a recent Washington Examiner op-ed bashed Republicans who engage in “trash-talking” their party’s candidates as “treasonous to the conservative cause,” though he later denied he was responding to McConnell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Carolina’s Scott on Sunday said Walker, Vance and Oz were \"gaining ground,\" while the GOP is \"in a pretty solid position with Ted Budd.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott last month sidestepped questions about whether he wants Trump to run for reelection in 2024, a shift from his stalwart support of Trump last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July, the senator’s new memoir was published with a note claiming he was making his own 2024 presidential bid. Scott refuted the error, which his team said editors had made without his knowledge.</p>",

Muncy hit three home runs in his last two games played against the Giants.  </p>\n<p>Manager Dave Roberts had told the media scrum on Saturday that Muncy would start at third base but perhaps to give his knee a little more time, Muncy starts at designated hitter today.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers will try to go five-for-five in their regular season series against the Padres today and even with 11 wins in 15 games, that is underplaying how these teams have played against each other this season.  </p>\n<p>The Dodgers have outscored the Padres 89 to 39 which means there is a 4-run differential per game so far this season.  The Dodgers are hitting .256/.330/.490 while the Padres have managed to go .189/.263/.298 in the first 15 games against the Dodgers.</p>\n<p>Joe Musgrove pitched well in his only start against the Dodgers this season, going seven innings and allowing three runs while striking out 10.

        "description": "<p>(13/13) “In prison there was a pill cart. They’d wheel it out at 5 PM, and they’d shout: ‘pill line!’ And everyone would get in line for pills. I wouldn’t do it. I told the warden: ‘I’d rather die. Either I keep my pills in my locker, or I’m not taking them.’ It’s been an obsession my whole life, keeping that secret. I gave a draft of this story to my bosses; just to let them know what was coming. Since then it’s been nothing but texts: ‘We love you, John. We’re proud of you.’ I guess it was a much bigger deal to me than everyone else. Last Friday was my birthday. Before the shift I could see everyone sneaking around. I thought: ‘They made me a cake, whatever.’ But it wasn’t just a cake. It was racks and racks of Philly Cheesesteaks. And an entire ice cream bar: hot fudge, sour patch kids, gummy bears. All my favorite stuff. The whole staff sang Happy Birthday, which I fucking hated. I’ve hated that song since the age of two. But then one of my bosses Maya gave a speech. She said: ‘John drives us fucking crazy, but we love him. And when his story comes out, you’ll realize he’s an even better human being than we realized.’ For her to say that: after knowing everything. I never knew. I just never knew people could feel that way about me. I grew up not knowing how to express. Then the HIV put me in a downward spiral of paranoia. Meth made it four levels deeper. And prison, prison threw dirt on the casket to make sure I’d never feel again. They almost got me. When they were singing that fucking song, they almost had me crying. But I said: ‘Listen guys, 5 more minutes to celebrate my birthday. Then it’s time for the show.’ The next day I drove out to New Jersey, to see my 86-year old mother. She can’t hear too well, so I read the story to her slow. She’s always been the one pushing me to get therapy. My whole life, I’ve been begging her: Stop worrying about me, Mom. Stop worrying if I’m ever going to be happy.’ But she’s relentless. It’s an obsession. But as I read the story to her, I could see it all drain out of her. Years and years of obsessive worry: gone. When I finished the last page, she said: ‘Johnny, maybe this can be the end. Maybe now you can let it go.’”</p>",

        "description": "<p>(12/13) “I spent the 4th of July alone in my new place. It’s a nice one-bedroom, overlooking the river. I cooked my favorite meal. Hard shell crabs, spread over pasta. I sat on the balcony and watched the fireworks. And suddenly I start crying like a baby, thinking about what they symbolize. The next morning I put on my suit, looked in the mirror, and called myself a pussy. My boss tells me I’m too intense. I get it. I’m too intense for myself; but there’s only one right way. One right way to be the best. And until it’s right, it’s not enough. It will never be enough; never, ever. I was supposed to die of AIDS in prison. That was supposed to be my legacy. They counted me out. A lot of people counted this restaurant out too. When we opened 20 years ago: Madonna was here, this star, that star, James Beard Award. But the New York dining culture moves on fast. Maybe some people thought we weren’t relevant anymore. Then the pandemic came. We were supposed to die. But look at us now: setting records, month-over-month. I wasn’t the only one to make it happen. It’s our whole team. It’s the way we make people feel. But it was my responsibility. I found every vendor that was overcharging us. I put an extra banquette on the wall, for thirteen more seats. I’ve got a list of 7,000 birthdays. And every person is getting an email, one week before, inviting them to celebrate at Craft. I’ll do whatever it takes. It will never be enough. Don’t tell me to let it go. Fuck you. That’s what everyone does; they let go of the anger. Don’t you understand? That’s what they want you to do. If they thought everyone was going to come home and be a motivated motherfucker asshole like me, maybe they’d fix the system. So your little brother, or your father, or your son, won’t have to deal with the same shit. How about you, Mr. Politician? When your son develops a drug problem because of your drive for power; maybe then you’ll care about the 2.2 million sons rotting away in prison, too ashamed to speak to their own fathers. You’ll be glad then that 56134066 didn’t let go. Not me, I’m never letting go. Never. Not until every single one of them says: ‘Wow, that motherfucker really did it.’</p>",

During the pandemic: alone in my room all day, no job, collecting food stamps, another year of my life down the drain. I slipped. But each time I’d think of Obama: how they ridiculed this man, and crucified him, for giving opportunities to people like me. What kind of payback would that be to him? I thought of every brother and sister in prison, waiting for their own Obama moment. What would that do to their chances? I knew it couldn’t just be about me. I’ve been there; I know where that leads. When it’s about me, I lose. After six months the halfway house wanted to discharge me into the NYC shelter system; I didn’t know what to do. It would have broken me. It was another inmate that suggested I meet with Iris. She was a case manager at Mt. Sinai hospital, working out of a 6x6 office. Nothing on the walls. I went there wanting to hate her, but I couldn’t. She was like Oprah: her voice was calm and comforting. We started going over my health questionnaire, and my entire history was in there. She wanted to know everything. No judgement. She just seemed interested; that’s all. Afterward she told me her own story. She’d gone to prison for her boyfriend’s drugs. Sixteen years; almost the exact same time as me. Now she was raising five kids. Youngest daughter died of cancer. Yet here she was: working 80 hours a week, in a 6x6 box, helping other people. She was one of the givers. Iris got me an apartment. She arranged my hip surgeries. She got me into a job training program. In the program they teach you to be up front about your history: tell them before they ask. I had a whole speech memorized. I scheduled six different in-person interviews, and six different times I couldn’t go inside. But the seventh time I made myself do it. I walked in those doors. The manager that day was Raven Peters, that big ole peckerwood. I said: ‘My name is John Gargano. Before we begin, I want you to know there’s a 15-year gap on my resume, and this is why.’ He wouldn’t let me finish. He said: “John, I don’t care about any of that. We care about two things here: how you treat our guests, and how you make them feel.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>(10/13) “I was 48 years old when they let me out. Twelve years of incarceration. The HIV medication had decayed my bones so badly, I could barely walk. I needed two full hip replacements. When they were checking me out at Discharge, the guards made a joke. They said: ‘See you when you get back.’ Same joke they make with everyone. It’s what they want. They want you back. Because without inmates, there’s no funding. No free labor, no correction officer picnics, no paid overtime. They need you coming back; 78 percent of inmates are reincarcerated within 3 years. ‘See you when you get back.’ Not me, motherfucker. Not 56134066. You’re never seeing me again. I’ve lost too much time. I decided right then, limping across that parking lot, that I was going to beat these people. And there’s only one way to beat a system incentivized by your failure, and that’s by succeeding. They don’t lift a finger to help you. They let you out with no money, no clothes. No health coverage. Not even a fucking driver’s license. At least someone from the clemency initiative escorted me to a halfway house in the Bronx; most guys just get dumped at the bus stop. The halfway house is just another arm of the criminal justice system. So many rules that it’s nearly impossible to get a full-time job. Most guys just give up, but I tried. I sent out applications to restaurant after restaurant. I’d see the same ‘Help Wanted’ ads in the newspaper for weeks. But the moment they found out about my record, they didn’t want help from me. Not 56134066. I developed a phobia of telling people about my past. I couldn’t hear it one more time. It’s the same message, coming from everywhere: ‘You made your choice. You’ve chosen to belong to this class of people. Now stay there.’ The whole world is saying it: scumbag, scumbag, scumbag. Then somehow, all on your own, living off food stamps, despite all your regret, all your self-loathing, you’ve got to summon the fortitude to not believe them. While the whole time it’s right there. One sniff. One sniff to erase everything: the HIV, every year I spent in prison, every cop, every CO, every judge that made me feel like nothing. One sniff to feel invincible again.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>(9/13) “August 3rd, 2016. There was heat that took the breath out of you: Alabama, 150-degree, muggy, humid, nasty fucking heat. Thankfully I was the landscape clerk, so I had my own desk. I was sitting there when I heard this jive turkey redneck voice over the intercom, asking me to report to the warden’s office at 12:30. It sounded like I was in trouble. I went to lunch, asked a few people what was going on. But nobody knew. When I get to the office there’s like eight guys sitting on the bench outside. Nobody knows each other, nobody’s talking, nobody knows what’s going on. But at some point it hits me, and I ask: ‘Did everyone here apply for clemency?’ And they said yes. And I said: ‘Well guys, this is it.’ They got called in one-by-one. And one-by-one they came out, each one of them cursing and slamming the door. I’m thinking: ‘Fuck, this ain’t good.’ I was the last name called. The phone on the desk started ringing the second I walked in. The associate warden tells me to pick it up. Touching the warden’s phone means six months in the shoe, so I hesitated. He says: ‘That’s a direct order.’ So I pick up the phone, and a female voice says: ‘Is this Mr. Gargano?’ And I’m like, ‘yah.’ And the voice says: ‘We’re calling to let you know that President Obama signed your petition this morning. You’re going home in four days.’ I went completely numb. I don’t think I even gave her a proper thank you. The landscape clerk has a golf cart. So I sleepwalked to my golf cart, and I drove it to a courtyard. I’d planted some flowers there: it was part of my responsibility. I sat down on a bench, and I cried. I wanted to celebrate. I wanted to scream. There was a fucking 4th of July firework finale going on in my heart, but I kept it under a blanket. There were other guys around, who might be more deserving than me, and I wanted to be respectful. So I just cried. I cried for an hour. I stayed there until it was getting close to count time, then I walked back to my unit. I called my mom. She said: ‘Johnny, what’s wrong?’ I said: ‘Nothing’s wrong, Mom.’ She said: ‘Johnny, what is it? What’s wrong?’ I said: ‘Nothing’s wrong, Mom. I’m coming home. I’m coming home in four days.’”</p>",

        "description": "<p>(8/13) “I remember the night Obama got elected. Very few times in the history of my stay in prison, would something so earth-shattering happen, that it would lift the spirits of the whole compound. But it was one those nights. 11 o’clock is normally a dead time in prison. But everyone was gathered around the TV in the common area. And when he walked out on that stage in Chicago, and gave that speech, with Michelle and the kids at his side, every last inmate was silent. No dominos were being slammed. There was no hyperness, no activity. It was completely still. It was hope. That’s what his entire campaign had been about: ‘Hope, hope, hope.’ And we felt it. We felt, finally: a guy who understands what’s going on in here. The overcriminalization. The overincarceration. The racial disparities. Were we hoping he’d repeal the mandatory minimum? I’d be lying if I didn’t say that. But the clemency program was something. It was more than anyone else had done. Me and Dino finished that application in record time. I included all my petitions for appeal. I included letters from friends and family who knew me, before the meth. Then I included one final letter, to Obama. I appealed to the man himself, and my belief that he was a decent human being. I explained my diagnosis. I told my entire story, then I sent it off. I knew there wasn’t much of a chance. I was competing against every guy, in every facility, across the country. Every crack offender got sentenced to 100x the weight of cocaine. There were probably one hundred thousand more people deserving than me. And each petition was 100 pages long. They didn’t have time to study each one closely, I knew that. They’d be trying to find one reason to disqualify you. One single reason. A few months later I got a call from a lawyer at the clemency initiative. She said my file was about to be reviewed, but first they’d need an opinion from my sentencing judge: the scumbag with the golf club. They reached out to him, and a few days later they got his response. She read it to me over the phone: ‘Good conduct in prison is no reason for a sentence reduction. I recommend a firm denial.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>(7/13) “When I got this job, I started at the bottom. Serving beers in a beer garden for $10 an hour. But I’m relentless. I did whatever I had to do: show up thirty minutes early, look your best, act your best. Do jobs that aren’t yours. If the table is 95 percent clean, make it 105 percent clean. If the guest wants one thing, bring them three. Say good morning before they do. Say good night before they do. Whatever it takes: to be the most seen, the most heard, to be the best. I’m relentless. Been that way my whole life. In prison I was a store man. It’s like a human bodega. There were seven of them on our compound, but I was the best. I had twenty lockers filled with cokes, candy bars, and potato chips. Each time a new prisoner came off the bus, I’d be there to greet him. I’d give him a care package: shampoo, deodorant, toothpaste. All of it for free. So the next time he needs a store man, he’s coming to me. It’s all about how you make people feel. It applies whether you’re in an upscale restaurant, or whether you’re in prison. I was a model inmate. Never had a single write-up. Not one altercation. And after six years they transferred me to a minimum-security facility in Montgomery, Alabama. It’s what’s known as a ‘camp.’ It had dorms, and a library. I had the best job on the whole compound: mowing the warden’s lawn. Tiny, Napoleon-ass motherfucker. But he had the best-looking lawn in the federal prison system. I made sure of that. I happened to be mowing his lawn on April 23rd, 2014, when I noticed everyone running to the prison yard. I knew there must be a rumor. Cause every time there’s a rumor, everyone runs straight to the yard. Usually the rumor turns out to be bullshit. But this time it was true: The Obama Administration had just announced a clemency program. Every federal inmate could apply for a presidential pardon. There were 200,000 federal inmates. Better odds than a mega millions lottery ticket, but not much better. I found a jailhouse lawyer named Dino, and we got started on my petition that same afternoon. I knew it was going to be the biggest fucking stack of applications in the world. And 56134066 was going to be sitting on the very top.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>(6/13) “The other night I was having dinner on the patio with someone who was in prison with me. We were sitting under these $20,000 custom Swiss-made umbrellas. We ordered something simple. But when you’re the boss, they bring you everything. All of it served in copper plates from France: Shishito Peppers, Potato Gnocchi, Summer Squash. Everything hyper-seasonal. Everything fresh from the green market. At one point my friend says: ‘Isn’t this surreal?’ And it really was. Considering five years earlier we were standing in the cafeteria line with 950 inmates, wearing boxers and jumpsuits that 9,000 other people had worn. Inmate 56134066. There’s a saying in prison: one man, one armband. Because the number on your armband is the only thing that belongs to you. There’s 2.2 million people in the American prison system, and half a million of those are locked up for drug offenses. A lot of them were in the same boat as me: victims of the mandatory minimum. Passed by Congress in 1986, it’s the reason hundreds of thousands of nonviolent people, mostly black and brown people, are rotting in prison. Rotting like the baloney and cheese sandwiches they serve for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I did believe wholeheartedly in my petition for appeal; all of us did. But a prisoner filing an appeal is like a person buying a mega millions lottery ticket. Only 1 out of 100,000 get a post-conviction break. But it’s enough for the rest of us to torture ourselves with hope. You have no choice. You can’t survive without hope. I spent all my time in the legal library, crafting those appeals. None of it mattered. Denied by the District Court. Denied by the Third Circuit. The wheels of justice turn slow, that’s what my public defender used to say. I’d been in prison for ten years by the time my petition reached the Supreme Court. They were never going to accept my case; I knew that. They take like six cases a year, but it was the only hope I had left. I spent a thousand hours on that petition. It was 50 pages long. The rejection letter arrived three months later, in a tiny envelope. It said: ‘Shut the fuck up and do your time. And that was the end of hope. After that, there was nothing.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>(5/13) “I’ve tried therapy five times. And I’ve quit five times. They torture me with questions, just like you’re doing. How do you feel? How do you feel? There is no feel. My nerve tips have been incinerated. By HIV, by meth, by prison. The only thing I feel is the throttle in my hand when I’m cranking it. Maybe you have time to sit around, saying: ‘What if? What if?’ But I have a to-do list longer than Eighth Avenue. I can’t keep digging up the most shameful, the most aggravating part of my life. When I go back there, I start hating myself. And that leads to one place. That leads to meth. So after this, I’m done. No more interviews. No more therapy. In prison we had our own version of therapy. It was a track in the yard, if you could even call it that, 100 yards of pebbles and potholes. But whenever things got to be too much, instead of slapping your cellmate for farting all night, you put on your headphones and walk the track. Think about anything you want. Just don’t think about the future; it’s the only way to protect yourself. Because nothing is in your control. Three years into my sentence my father was diagnosed with cancer. My mom had to deal with the whole thing herself. With everything else she was going through, she took him to all his appointments. One time I called her and they’d just gotten back from chemotherapy. They were still in the car, because my father had shit himself, and she couldn’t get him out. They were waiting on my Uncle Tommy to come help. How humiliating is that? The man who provided you everything, sitting in his own shit, for forty-five minutes, and you can’t do a thing. How’s that for being a complete fucking failure? We had one final call, right before he passed. He said: ‘I’m not giving up on you,’ same as the other times. But this time was different. This time was goodbye. He said: ‘Johnny, my time is about up. Take care of your mother and sister.’ I told him I would. But I wasn’t coming home for 15 years. We both knew I wasn’t going to take care of anyone. It was nothing but a show. When I hung up the phone, I wanted to scream at someone. But there was nobody but me. So I put on my headphones, and went out to the track.”</p>",

When they closed the door of that cell, I remember looking at the graffiti all over the walls. Grime everywhere. Hair on the floor a quarter inch deep. And sitting in the middle of the floor was two sheets and a blanket. I didn’t have the meth anymore. It was just me, those sheets, and that mess. I spent all my time imagining what it would be like to die in prison. Every little cold, every little stomachache, I thought: This is it. And what kind of death would that be? Everyone wants to die with dignity. But there was no dignity here. I didn’t tell a soul about my diagnosis. Show vulnerability, in this place? I’m no dummy. But the guards knew, because they had a list with a code next to my name. They kept making little innuendos. Fucking infuriating. I didn’t even talk about my diagnosis with the phlebotomist who checked my blood. But one day we’re in there alone, and I finally got the courage to ask him: ‘What do you think? Will I make it out of here alive?’ I’ll never forget him; his name was Alex. He said: ‘With the new drugs now, you’ll live longer than the rest of these clowns.’ It was my first glimpse of hope in six years, but it came too late. When you’re in prison: you might as well be dead. You’re in a coma. You’re not making new memories. You wouldn’t even know time was passing if it wasn’t for the 13th of every month, when your phone minutes reset. My first call was always to my mother. It was an ebb and flow. Most days she was upbeat. Other days it was: ‘Why? Why? Why?’ But she never left my side. Sent me a letter every week. Visited whenever she could. My father never came to see me, but I didn’t take it personal. He didn’t come to my baseball games either. Sometimes my Mom would hand him the phone, and he’d say: ‘I’m not giving up on you.’ That was it; it’s just who he was. He was an old school onion farmer. If you wanted to get a beer after work, and stare at the Eagles game on TV, he’d be there. But ‘I love you?’ Nah, none of that. That was Mom. Supposedly he changed after I went to prison, and I’m happy for that. I really am. But I never got to see it.”</p>",

He pulls out a key and says: ‘sniff this.’ I’d never done a drug in my life, not even weed. Not even once. But I figured I’d be dead in two years anyway, so I said fuck it. One sniff. And that’s all it took. Meth makes you feel invincible. It erases all your insecurities. The perfect drug for a guy like me, hiding a secret like I was hiding. But it wasn’t cheap like today. And when you really want something, but you can’t afford it, there’s only one option. At first I was just selling to stay high, but I have to be the best at whatever I do. Not a bad quality when you’re managing a 5-star restaurant. Horrible quality when you’re selling meth. I went from a quarter-gram, to a gram, to an ounce, to a kilogram. Never violent, never hurt nobody. But the drug turned me into a sociopathic scumbag. I’d rip people off, and not give them their drugs. I’d get 57 parking tickets on a car I was borrowing. I withdrew from all my friends, all my family. My mother never gave up on me, I will say that. She’s relentless. It was four years of unanswered voicemails: ‘Why are you doing this? What are you running from? Why, why, why?’ There were no voicemails from my father. But I did see him once, at the garden shop. I’d lost 20 lbs. I hadn’t shaved. I hadn’t showered. He said: ‘Whatcha doin’ Johnny? You’re breaking your mother’s heart.’ And that was it. He could never tell me that I was breaking his heart too, because that would require an expression of emotion. But I didn’t care. I didn’t care about anything. I wasn’t even Johnny Gargano anymore; I was a taker. And every taker runs out of things to take, and people to take from. Takers end up in Room 911, with their face pressed against the carpet, and their hands cuffed behind their back. I’ll never forget when the Feds marched me out of the lobby, this 6’5” black guy walks up. He’s wearing a suit. He’s got a walkie talkie in his hand. He says: ‘Excuse me, are you John Gargano? You’re never allowed in a Lowes Hotel again.’ Even the cops laughed at that one. I said: ‘Bro, I’m going to jail for the rest of my life.’”</p>",

I hadn’t been in the room for 5 minutes when there was a knock on the door. A voice said: ‘Housekeeping.’ But I knew: ‘That’s not fucking housekeeping.’ Nine guys bust in carrying every type of gun known to man. And that was the end. Part of me was glad it was over. I’d become a scumbag. A complete, sociopathic scumbag. But before any of this happened, Johnny Gargano was a pretty good person. I really believe that. Not the most emotional guy. Not the most expressive guy, but certainly not a scumbag. I believed in right and wrong. I’d bring baskets of vegetables to my friends’ mothers. I was a freaking altar boy for ten years. Not saying that means anything, those child molesting fucks. But with all things considered: a pretty good person. Then one afternoon I’m taking a nap on the couch, and there’s a knock on the door. It’s the Fed-Ex guy, with a package from the health insurance company. It says my application for coverage has been denied. Now there were only six reasons you could be denied. The first five were crazy bugs in Africa. I was a farm boy from New Jersey; I’d never been to Africa in my life. So that left the sixth thing: HIV Positive. How did I get it? Some things in life are nobody’s business. Not then, not now. It’s taken me 25 years to even talk about my diagnosis. I come from an old school Italian family where nobody talks about nothing, especially the men. Everything gets swept under the rug. Could all of this been avoided with a conversation? Who knows. But I didn’t know how to have it. I couldn’t handle the stigma. I couldn’t handle the shame.  At the time I had a garden shop, with thirty greenhouses; I left them all behind. I packed up my shit and moved to Philadelphia. This was 1997; there were no miracle drugs back then. I thought 100 percent for sure I was going to die. I didn’t know exactly what was going to happen to me, but I knew it wasn’t going to be pretty. I felt like I’d just been ejected from a roller coaster, and I said: ‘Fuck it. I’m going to do whatever the fuck I want before I hit the ground.”</p>",

I tell that to every member of my staff, it doesn’t matter how you feel: you could be hungover, you could be facing eviction, your girlfriend could be home in bed with the neighbor. None of that has anything to do with the first guest who walks in the door, who chose this restaurant instead of 10000 others, because of its 21-year reputation for impeccable service. How do we make that person feel? That’s the essence of hospitality. And when you’ve spent a good portion of your life caged up like a monkey, eating food marked ‘not for human consumption,’ you might be a little extra attuned to how people feel. I’ll never forget the day of my sentencing. Worst judge in the Southern District. A living embodiment of the arrogance of the entire criminal justice system. First time I met him he had a golf club in his hands, and he’s putting golf balls across the courtroom floor. He says: ‘We going to trial today?’ Doesn’t even look up. It’s like I wasn’t even there. And after my trial, when that motherfucker said 240 months, I lifted my hands, started counting on my fingers, and divided 240 by 12. Twenty years. For a first-time offender. That’s when the rage started. But I didn’t know where to direct it. At Congress? For passing a mandatory minimum for drug offenses? At the scumbag with the golf club? I looked at my public defender, and she just shrugs. I look at the prosecutor, and she says: ‘I’m sorry Mr. Gargano, it’s the law.’ She wasn’t sorry. I was just another point on her scorecard. Bottled water, a day-old newspaper, meant to be thrown away. Inmate #56134066. That’s all I was to any of them. She’s going to come in here one day, the prosecutor who put me away. I’ve seen her name come up twice in our reservation system, but she’s cancelled each time. But one day she’ll come. I’ll walk up her to her table. I’ll say: ‘First time here?’, and I’ll hand her my card. I want to watch her face when she sees the name. She’ll probably say: ‘I heard what happened. I’m so happy for you.’ It’s nothing but a show. Really she’ll be thinking: ‘Wow. This motherfucker really did it.’”</p>",

I downloaded a dating app for seniors, called Our Time. I said: ‘Lord, you designed the body. I’m losing my ever-loving mind, so I hope you understand.’ I just wanted to see what was out there. And let me tell you, there’s a lot out there. I’ve tried all the flavors: Bangladesh, Egyptian, Hispanic, African. The whole smorgasbord. I’ve dated about seventy men. And I’ve had four marriage proposals, because what I bring to the table is rich. But right now I’m on a little bit of a break from romance. I’m taking time with myself. But that’s a romance too. It’s a love that’s lacy. It’s light filtering through the leaves. It’s not harsh sun, but it’s oh-so-warm. For 55 years I never liked myself much. But now when I hear people describe me, I like that woman. I’ve worked hard on her. I might be a little quirky. Truth be told I’ve sat down and pondered if I’m batshit crazy. But I decided no, I just hover over crazy, then I flit away. Like a hummingbird. Back in Arkansas I’d hang out feeders for the hummingbirds. I’d watch em’ all day. So I don’t mind being hummingbird crazy. I can be colorful, and dance, and sing, and make mistakes. I’m not hurting anybody. I’m not taking anybody else’s oxygen. I’ve got my own space. In the evening I like to set my chair out on the sidewalk, turn on my Bluetooth speaker, light my cigar. I never just stick the fire to it. I go around all the edges, and let it breathe a little. Until there’s no dead spots. Until I’ve pulled all the life into the it. Then I sit back, take a deep breath, and watch Harlem walk by. I smoke slow. It’ll take me two hours to finish. And I’ve made myself a playlist that lasts just that long: Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Bruno Mars. Everything has an order. And when that last song starts playing, it’s time to go home.

        "description": "<p>(14/15) “Lucas volunteered to bring up all my stuff from the storage unit in Arkansas. He was supposed to arrive on a Monday, so the following Sunday I scheduled a final performance of ‘One Woman’s Journey To Love.’ I wanted it to be a night to remember: my show, my songs, in my place, with my stuff. Unfortunately Lucas was delayed, and by the time he arrived we barely had time to get everything unloaded. On the night of the performance, the bathtub had stuff stacked up to the shower. Twenty-five people attended. The band set up in the kitchen, and I performed while standing in the hallway. There were some new songs in the mix: ‘My Way,’ and ‘Wild Horses,’ and ‘Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head.’ I sang a hymn for the first time. I’d never sang a hymn in my show before, because I hadn’t wanted to put people off. But it’s what I believe. So I sang ‘Lord I Need Thee Every Hour.’ At the end I gave a little monologue; I told the audience: ‘We are dealt so much in life that’s wrong. And we do so much that we wish we hadn’t. But you’re so much more than those things. You are beautiful, and you are needed in the world.’ Then I closed with ‘You Are So Beautiful,’ by Joe Cocker. Margaret stayed behind to drink a glass of wine after everyone left. We settled into the 14-foot sectional. And I started to look around, at all my stuff. Beneath my feet was the giant Oriental Rug my kids had given me one Christmas, they’d split the cost seven ways. There was my collection of antique Nancy Drew mysteries. There were my three pictures of curved bridges. The hurricane lamp, with a cardinal, that my daughter had given me. Because she knows how much I love little lights. My rooster plates, my rooster platter, the rooster lamp from Cracker Barrel. My upholstered coffee table. The drapes I’d sewn from my favorite fabric at Hobby Lobby. I’d waited weeks for it to go on sale. I never thought I could do a good job because we were so poor. But looking around at all this stuff, I realized something: it was beautiful. When it all came together, it was beautiful. Maybe I hadn’t been given many choices in life. But I always knew what beauty was. And even in the ugly, I created beauty.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>(13/15) “The first thing I did when I got a real paycheck was hire a real estate broker. I told him that I only had one requirement. He said: ‘Not in New York. Not at your price point.’ But I told him: ‘I’m a praying woman.’ Sure enough he called the very next day. He said: ‘You’re not going to believe this. But I found a place in Harlem.’ We went to see it that very night. It was a one-bedroom, right around the corner from a cigar shop. I walked straight into the living room, took out my tape measure, and measured the walls. 14 feet exactly, just big enough for my sectional. And I knew I was home. Lucas was so proud of me. And Garrison bought me a second charm for my bracelet. It was a little house, with ‘Home Sweet Home’ written on it. But my other children still weren’t speaking to me. After I moved in, I went on Facebook and printed out their photos. I put them all over the apartment. Because I wanted to feel like they were still part of my life. Their birthdays were always tough for me. So were the holidays. I’d never lived alone before, so I was dreading my first Christmas in the new apartment. I made sure to plan out my entire day: I was going to read all morning, cook some salmon for lunch, then crawl into bed at 4 PM to watch the Christmas Prince on Netflix. The plan was going great. When I finished my reading, I was so proud of myself. I thought: ‘I’m almost through Christmas Day.’ Then I looked at the clock and it was only 10:15 in the morning. And I lost it. I just lost it. I went through my whole apartment, and took down all the pictures of my children. I stuffed them in a drawer. I couldn’t face them. I felt like a horrible mother, and a hypocrite. For all those years I’d gone from church to church, teaching about marriage and motherhood. I told everyone: ‘Put Jesus first, others second, and yourself last.’ But that isn’t what I’d done. I moved to New York and put myself first. And now I had five kids that wouldn’t talk to me. The old feelings of guilt and shame started washing over me. I let myself go for a few minutes, but then I pulled myself back up. Jab with the left. Jab with the left. Cross with the right, and fuck that shit.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>(12/15) “I was still in the shelter at Christmastime, so Garrison flew in from Arkansas to be with me. We ate a Christmas meal together. We went and looked at the windows on 5th Avenue. And right before he left to go home, Garrison gave me a small box, with a bracelet inside. On it there was a single charm, with the skyline of New York City. He told me: ‘This is your New Life Bracelet. And I’m going to get you a charm for every new accomplishment.’ From that day on—whenever things got hard, I’d twirl that charm between my fingers, and trust that things would get better. Every morning the shelter guard would wake me up at 3 AM, so I could catch the train to Brooklyn. I worked the opening shift at Starbucks. But I never minded. Loving on people has always been my favorite thing to do. I knew all my customers’ names. I’d memorized their orders. My favorite thing was when I got to write their name on the cup. I’d always draw a special little curve underneath, just to let them know they were special. One of my favorite customers was a man named Eric. He sometimes came in with his husband. And he was quick to grin, so whenever I had a break we would get to chatting. I had no idea what he did for work. But I told him the same thing that I told all my favorite customers: ‘If you know anybody who’s looking for a receptionist, keep me in mind.’ It turns out that Eric was the CEO of a consulting company, and he asked me to put together a resume. All I’d ever done was church work. So there wasn’t much to put on there, but in the end it didn’t matter. The interviewer told me that the office printer wasn’t working. He said: ‘Let’s not worry about your resume. Tell me your story instead.’ When I finished he asked if he could give me a hug. And they ended up creating a position just for me: HR Assistant. My starting pay was $50,000 a year, with benefits. A few days after I got hired, Eric took me out to coffee. He told me: ‘I know you think I got you this job, but I didn’t pull any strings. I handed them your resume, and all I said was: I have an unorthodox candidate.’”</p>",

        "description": "<p>(11/15) “I’d always head straight to the gym after my shift at Starbucks. Martin trained me for free the entire time I was in the shelter. He told me that he was going to turn me into a fighter. He was hard on me. He said I had more problems than a math book. And if I ever complained, he’d call me a drama queen. One afternoon I came in upset, because I’d just gotten an email from my husband, saying I was outside the will of God. It had really shaken me. But when I told Martin what happened, all he said was: ‘Fuck that shit.’ He told me to get in the ring. And as he wrapped my hands, he said: ‘We’re going to do things a little different today. Every time you throw a cross, you’re going to say: ‘Fuck that shit.’ I laughed. I said: ‘Oh, no. I don’t talk like that.’ But Martin wasn’t laughing. He said: ‘You’ll talk like that today.’ I looked around the gym, and it was just me and him. So I gave it a try. Jab with the left. Jab with the left. Cross with the right, and: ‘Fuck that shit.’ Martin was wearing the pads on his hands; and he’s saying: ‘Louder. kid. Louder.’ He said: ‘Nobody fucks with you, nobody.’ Which wasn’t true of course, because I’d been fucked with my entire life. But I tried it again, this time even louder: ‘Fuck that shit.’ Louder. ‘Fuck! That! Shit!’ We did it for thirty minutes. With each punch, I got louder and louder until I was screaming. At first those words were just about my husband, and the email he had sent. But as I kept hitting the pads, those words became something else. It became my way of giving voice to everything that was done to me in the name of God. The psychological abuse in the marriage. The sexual abuse as a child. All the guilt I’d been made to feel, all the shame. Fuck. That. Shit. It was wrong. I’ve known it was wrong my whole life. But I never defended myself. Or if I tried, it was: ‘Get back in your place.’ But now I was doing something. I was fighting back. At the end of the day when I walked out the door, I felt relieved of so much pain.  Martin called me over to the desk. He said: ‘Listen, kid. From now on, every time someone tries to mess with you, or makes you feel less than, you gotta say it: ‘Fuck that shit.’”</p>",

        "description": "<p>(10/15) “My first night in the shelter I found a folding chair and sat with my back against the wall. I needed to feel something solid against my back. I didn’t know if there was going to be a bottom that I could hit, and bounce back up. Or if it was just going to be darkness and I’d never come out again. I was scared. But I was also angry. I felt like my identity had been stolen. From the time I was two years old, until the night I entered the shelter, somebody else had been in control of my life. Each day for ‘check-in’ the women would line up against a brick wall. But I never wanted to be in that line, so I would walk around the neighborhood until the last minute. One day I noticed that a boxing club had opened a few blocks down. They were offering trial lessons for $40, so I decided to go see what it was all about. There weren’t many athletic clothes in the shelter’s clothing closet. So I came to my lesson wearing faded blue men’s swimming trunks, an oversized T-shirt, and my black Starbucks work shoes. The owner’s name was Martin. And one thing about Martin, is that he’s always saying ‘kid.’ He took one look at me when I walked in the door, and said: ‘What’s your greatest fear kid?’ I told him I had a fear of defending myself. Because as a child I’d been abused by men in our church, over and over. And if I raised my arms to defend myself, they abused me worse. I asked Martin if we could maybe start with a speed bag. But he told me they didn’t have a speed bag. He threw me a towel, and said: ‘Get in the ring, kid. I’m about to change your life.’ He had me doing exercises named after animals: crab stuff, and bear stuff, and duck things. I thought I was going to die. The whole time he was telling jokes. They were bad jokes, but he kept me so scrambled that I forgot about my fear. That first day he taught me how to do the ‘jab, jab, cross.’ Two jabs with the left, and a cross with the right. And I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the hitting. When we finished Martin asked me when I was coming back. I told him I couldn’t, because I didn’t have any money. He said it didn’t matter. He called out to the person running the desk, and said: ‘Hey! Put this kid on my list!’”</p>",

        "description": "<p>(9/15) “It was magic that night. I didn’t miss any lines, or any beats. I sang seventeen of my favorite love songs: ‘Somewhere Over The Rainbow,’ Unforgettable,’ ‘Love Look What You’ve Done to Me.’ Toward the end of the show I sang ‘Dance With Me,’ by Orleans. I told the audience that for eight years I’d begged my husband to waltz with me, but he never would. He kept saying that I was too short. When I started to sing, the whole audience got up and danced with me. In that moment I could feel my chains breaking. It might have been the first time in my life I felt completely free. On the night of my performance, I’d been living in New York for just over a year. And a year is a long time to have someone living in your house. Lucas never made me feel like a burden, but I felt like a burden. For months I’d been praying to God: ‘Help me find a way out of here.’ And he answered that prayer. Just not in the way I was expecting. One morning Lucas told me that we needed to talk. He said that Margaret had been offered a job out-of-state, and she was going to take it. He invited me to come with them. I couldn’t bare the thought of starting all over again, in a new place. But most of all I didn’t want to be a burden. So I told him: ‘Thank you. I’m alive because of you, but I’m going to stay.’ When Lucas moved away, I lost the last bubble of protection between me and New York City. Garrison begged me to come live with him in Arkansas. He had an extra room in his apartment. But he was living in the town where I was born, and I just couldn’t do it. I told him: ‘If it gets bad, I’ll come live with you.’ And he said: ‘Mama, a homeless shelter is bad.’ I told him: ‘Not bad enough.’ I checked into a private shelter in Chinatown. There were thirty women in one room with fifteen bunk beds. On the night I was admitted, they made me have my picture taken for a photo ID card. I had to sign a piece of paper, to prove that I was homeless. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. When I put my signature on that line, I felt like I was sealing my doom.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>The final Pecker Checker of the season sees Fayetteville earn a victory.</p> The Low-A Fayetteville Woodpeckers played their season finale on Sunday afternoon. \n<p>The Houston Astros top 30 prospects are well represented here in the southern part of North Carolina, with eight of them making their current baseball home in Fayetteville. Namely, OF Drew Gilbert (2), OF Jacob Melton (6), OF Ryan Clifford (8), RHP Alex Santos (15), RHP Miguel Ullola (20), OF Logan Cerny (22), OF/SS/3B Tyler Whitaker (25), and RHP Alimber Santa (26). </p>\n<p>Carlos Calderon (4-6, 4.25) made the start for Fayetteville, opposite Lynchburg Hillcats starter Ryan Webb (1-1, 4.24). After the first pitch at 2:09 PM local time, Calderon worked a 1-2-3 first inning. In the bottom of the frame, Tyler Whitaker scored the first baserunner of the game with a two-out single, but was stranded there when Clifford lined out one batter later. </p>\n<p>In the second, Calderon allowed his first baserunner when he issued a one-out walk to Isaiah Greene. Greene erased himself a moment later when he was caught stealing on a bang-bang play, as backstop Ryan Wrobleski flashed his golden laser-powered rocket-rifle arm to good effect. </p>\n<p>In the bottom of the second, Peckers first baseman John Garcia hit a one-out double down the right-field line. It was notable in that the ball came off the bat at about 38 MPH (estimated). </p>\n<p>Aside from that, the first three innings came and went without either team making an impression on the scoreboard. Calderon was lifted at that point, having struck out three, walked two, and surrendered zero hits or runs. He put 28-of-45 pitches over the plate. Nolan Devos relieved, and after letting runners onto the corners with nobody out, went on to strike out the side. </p>\n<p>After an eventless bottom of the fourth, Devos again worked a 1-2-3 inning, collecting another pair of strikeouts. With the score still knotted at zero in the bottom of the sixth, Tommy Sacco got to first on a leadoff walk, then took second on a Wardquelin Vásquez wild pitch. Vasquez then issued a second walk, to Whitaker. What happened then was something that all 4,522 in attendance were waiting for:</p>\n\n\n<p>BOT 6: Ryan Clifford ending the season in style! His first home run in Fayetteville is a three-run blast for the lead!Woodpeckers 3 - Hillcats 0 pic.twitter.com/NPqnUFZVTJ</p>— Fayetteville Woodpeckers (@WoodpeckersNC) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Organizational number eight prospect Clifford went deep to center field for three runs off the already beleaguered Vásquez. </p>\n<p>With the three run lead, Fayetteville again turned to the bullpen, this time calling in Tyler Guilfoil. The six-four righty was Houston’s eighth-round choice a few weeks ago, and since turning pro now has 31 whiffs in 17 1⁄3 innings. He’s given up one run on five hits and seven walks for a 0.692 WHIP. He didn’t surprise anyone today, striking out three Hillcats on 12 pitches. He went on to total seven whiffs in three innings, allowing no runs, no hits, and two walks.</p>\n<p>Fayetteville didn’t have a very good season, finishing 55-75, but minor league baseball is never about wins and losses. It’s about two things, depending on where you’re sitting in the world. It’s about developing prospects, and it’s about taking pride in something so unabashedly American that it borders on camp. All that’s academic, though. Also, the good folks at MILB.TV caught an engagement on Kiss Cam!</p>\n\n\n<p>Segra Stadium caught an engagement on the Kiss Cam during the seventh-inning stretch. Go Woodpeckers! pic.twitter.com/8gdMtuStcp</p>— Astros prospects HQ (@AstrosProspects) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Although the minor league season is over for these guys, the Houston Astros still have a ways to go in their quest for a second World Series Championship. In the meantime, I’ll be starting an offseason-long series on every player (all 316) to appear in the system for the Astros through the 2022 season. It starts tomorrow, with players who appeared only below the Double-A level, and will run through February 16. </p>\n<p>I’d like to thank the good folks at Segra Stadium for making this season such a pleasure to cover, and the equally good folks who frequent the pages at Crawfish Boxes for reading. </p>",

Singer is now 8-4 on the year; his ERA is down to 3.21.</p>\n<p>The Royals’ offense: a Nick Pratto sac fly in the first, a Drew Waters two-run double in the second, and a Michael Massey home run in the fourth. </p>\n<p>It was Massey’s second home run of his career. Bobby Witt was the only Royals player to record multiple hits. Hunter Dozier, to everyone’s shock, went hitless. </p>\n<p>Anything else we really need to disclose? In a September game between two teams that are a combined 60 games under .500? Nah, didn’t think so.</p>\n<p>The Royals are 57-84.

        "description": "He was excellent today. At least he won’t be tagged with the loss. | Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Mitch Keller was Excellent Mitch, but much like last night, the winds went out of the Pirate Ship’s sails in the ninth.</p> <p>Admittedly, part of the problem just might be that the Pirates aren’t used to having leads.</p>\n<p>Chase De Jong gave up two homers in the ninth inning, including a two-run bomb by Albert Pujols (who’s officially ahead of A-Rod now) to destroy an excellent Mitch Keller outing and give the Cardinals the series, 4-3.</p>\n<p>Over seven innings, Keller only gave up two hits, walked three, and struck out six while shutting out the Cardinals. Oneil Cruz got the Pirates on the board first in the third inning with a forceout, bringing Greg Allen home after he singled off Jose Quintana and was moved up by a steal and a Jason Delay single. Derek Shelton also got tossed in the third after objecting to a third strike call on Bryan Reynolds.  Jack Suwinski hit a homer in the seventh to give the Pirates a 2-0 lead.</p>\n\n\n<p>Jack with a jack! pic.twitter.com/m6HQL0wj6C</p>— Pittsburgh Pirates (@Pirates) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>I imagine that Keller is on either a pitch count or an inning limit because he was yanked in the seventh in favor of Duane Underwood Jr., who pitched a scoreless eighth. Then Chase de Jong ruined any chance of Mitch buying him a postgame beer, promptly giving up two doubles to Tommy Edman and Corey Dickerson in the ninth. Dickerson brought Edman home, and Pujols bombed Dickerson home. And just like that, the Pirates were on the losing end. Some minor hope blossomed in the bottom of the ninth when Greg Allen homered, but too little, too late. To add insult to injury, former Pirate Chris Stratton got the win for the Cardinals. </p>\n<p>Well at least the Steelers won, so Pittsburgh didn’t do a total oh-fer this weekend.</p>",

There aren’t many more weasel words than learnings. It’s a word that’s popular with chin strokers, with LinkedIn loiterers, and with football coaches. In the past, there haven’t been many learnings (sorry) to take from the second week of finals. Semi finals are often a reordering of the top four, a reminder not to be seduced by the previous week’s winner.</p><p>But this weekend was different. This weekend taught us a lot. We learnt, for instance, that Melbourne simply isn’t good enough. After Round 10, they were the shortest priced premiership favourites in the history of the game. “Be very afraid,” David King said. “Melbourne are going at about 70 per cent of last year, and they’re already proving they are 50 per cent better than the rest of the competition.”</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>A Sunday afternoon at the ballpark of the Miami Marlins.</p> <p>In a mercifully easy game in Miami, the Mets took care of business and topped the Marlins 9-3. Taijuan Walker was excellent, the offense beat up on Jesus Luzardo, and the bullpen didn’t totally blow it. The only downer note was Mark Vientos, who went 0-for-5 with two strikeouts in his major league debut. </p>\n<p>This game started in a frustrating fashion - Brandon Nimmo was robbed of a triple on a terrible call by a terrible crew, then the Mets wasted first and second with nobody out. No matter, they scored three in the second, one more in each of the third and fourth, and two more in the fifth. Nimmo and Eduardo Escobar homered and Jeff McNeil had a nice day with an RBI single, but the biggest offensive star was Tomas Nido. Yes really. The Mets’ catcher had three hits, three RBI, and most importantly, his first home run of the season. </p>\n<p>On the mound, we got good Taijuan today, with the righty hurling seven innings of one run ball. The only blemish on the scorecard was a solo home run from Brian Anderson in the fourth. Seth Lugo came in for the eighth and surrendered a two-run homer, but the offense did enough to make that hiccup inconsequential.</p>\n<p>With the win, the Mets cling on to first by at least a half game over the Braves as they continue to fight tooth and nail for the division. Atlanta is headed to San Francisco for three with the Giants, while the Mets will host the Cubs. Chris Bassitt is scheduled to start, with Chicago’s starter TBD.</p>\nSB Nation GameThreads\n<p>Amazin’ AvenueFish Stripes</p>\nBox scores\n<p>MLB.comESPN</p>\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs.com\n  \n<p>What’s WPA?</p>\n<p>Big Mets winner: Brandon Nimmo, +35.0% WPABig Mets loser: NoneMets pitchers: +14.9% WPAMets hitters: +34.9% WPATeh aw3s0mest play: Brandon Nimmo hits a three-run homer in the second, +26.9% WPATeh sux0rest play: Brain Anderson homers in the fourth, -4.8% WPA</p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>Former big league reliever Anthony Varvaro died in a car accident this morning, according to multiple media reports.  The 37-year-old Varvaro became a New York/New Jersey Port Authority police officer after retiring from baseball, and the car accident took place while he was heading for duty at the September 11th memorial service today in downtown New York City.</p>\n<p>A Staten Island native, Varvaro’s pro baseball career began when the Mariners selected him in the 12th round of the 2005 draft.  Varvaro made his big league debut with the Mariners in 2010, and then spent the next four seasons pitching with the Braves before tossing 11 innings with the Red Sox in 2015, his final MLB season.</p>\n<p>Varvaro had some very solid numbers in the majors, posting a 3.23 ERA over 183 2/3 career innings.  He emerged as a workhorse in Atlanta’s bullpen in 2013-14, with 123 appearances and 128 innings over those two seasons (with an impressive 2.74 ERA).  The Red Sox acquired him during the 2014-15 offseason, though his work in 2015 and a would-be trade to the Cubs were both cut short by flexor tendon surgery.  After pitching with Boston’s Triple-A affiliate in 2016, Varvaro then decided to retire at age 31, and pursue a new career in law enforcement.</p>\n<p>We at MLB Trade Rumors send our condolences to Varvaro’s family, friends, and colleagues.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Athletics right-hander Daulton Jefferies underwent a Tommy John surgery on Friday, the team announced.  Jefferies had already undergone a season-ending thoracic outlet syndrome surgery in July, and now this TJ procedure will surely keep him out of action until the start of the 2024 season.</p>\n<p>It is a brutal turn of events for the 27-year-old right-hander, who now faces dual rehabs and a lot of uncertainty about his future.  This is also the second Tommy John procedure of Jefferies’ young career, as his first surgery wiped out most of his 2017 and 2018 seasons in Oakland’s farm system.  Given this checkered health history, it is fair to wonder if Jefferies will be able to return to the mound whatsoever, let alone return and become an effective Major League pitcher.</p>\n<p>The 37th overall pick of the 2016 draft, Jefferies was seen as one of the Athletics’ top pitching prospects on his way up the minor league ladder, and he has appeared in each of the last three MLB seasons.  After tossing two innings in 2020, Jefferies threw 15 frames in 2021 and then 39 1/3 innings this year, with a 5.75 ERA to show for his career to date in the Show.</p>\n<p>The A’s were hoping Jefferies could step into a regular role in the starting rotation this year, and things seemed promising early, when the righty had a 1.17 ERA over his first three starts and 15 1/3 innings.  However, batters then began to find a lot more success against Jefferies, whose 16.3% strikeout rate didn’t help his cause.  While Jefferies has some respectable strikeout totals in the minors, he hasn’t been able to miss many bats at the big league level.</p>\n<p>Jefferies will continue to amass big league service time while on the injured list, and while he is controlled through the 2027 season, that long-term view isn’t as important to the A’s as the more immediate need to just get Jefferies healthy.  With another rebuild taking place in Oakland, the Athletics were hoping that Jefferies could step forth as a potential cornerstone for the next winning A’s club.</p>",

Christian Yelich and Willy Adames both singled before Rowdy Tellez drove them in with a double to make it 2-0 quickly.</p>\n<p>Woodruff allowed the Reds to knot it up at 2-2 in the top of the second on two doubles and two singles, but the Brewers answered back with two outs in the bottom of the inning.</p>\n<p>Yelich singled home Jace Peterson, who had walked earlier in the inning, and Adames and Tellez followed that up with back-to-back homers to make it 6-2 after two.</p>\n<p>Both offenses settled down a bit from there, with the only other run before the seventh inning coming on Tellez’s second home run of the day in the fourth, a solo shot to make it 7-2.</p>\n<p>Woodruff was strong the rest of the day, allowing just the two runs across six innings on five hits and a walk while tallying 11 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Despite the strong start from Woodruff, the Brewers’ bullpen looked shaky and nearly gave the game away late. Peter Strzelecki took the ball in the seventh with a 7-2 lead but immediately gave up a single and a two-run homer to Alejo Lopez to cut the game to 7-4 Milwaukee.</p>\n<p>Strzelecki got out of the inning with three straight groundouts and Taylor Rogers struck out two in a scoreless eighth. While the Brewers had plenty of offense early, they couldn’t muster much after the fourth, spoiling a bases-loaded opportunity in the fifth and getting set down in order in the sixth, seventh and eighth.</p>\n<p>Devin Williams entered for a save opportunity in the top of the ninth but got into some trouble quickly, allowing a double and single to start the inning. A ground ball to Peterson at third that should have resulted in the first out of the inning instead turned into an error, cutting the lead to 7-5 and giving the Reds runners at second and third with no outs.</p>\n<p>Williams settled down under pressure, however, striking out Kyle Farmer and getting TJ Friedl to hit a sac fly to left center as Garrett Mitchell made a clutch diving catch for the second out. With a 7-6 lead and a runner still at second, Williams struck out Jonathan India to end the game.</p>\n<p>Tellez had his fifth multi-homer game of the season, going 3-for-5 with the two bombs and a double as well as four RBIs. Yelich went 2-for-5 and Adames went 2-for-4 with a homer of his own. Outside of the top three in the order, the Crew batted just 2-for-19, but the seven runs were enough for the win.</p>\n<p>Milwaukee finally gets an off day on Monday before traveling to St. Louis for a quick two-game series against the Cardinals.</p>",

Anthony Albanese says it’s not yet time to debate Australia becoming a republic, after the death of the monarch. Overnight the Queen’s coffin arrived in Edinburgh as thousands lined the streets. In Australia parliament has been suspended – but this could scupper the timeline of one of Labor’s core election commitments. And Ukraine has continued to push back Russian forces in the country’s east.</p><p>The prime minister has said “now is not the time” to discuss Australia becoming a republic. Albanese told the ABC, “now is a time for us to pay tribute to the life of Queen Elizabeth.” The comments came as Australia proclaimed the ascension of King Charles III, with hundreds of people lining the forecourt and streets around Parliament House to watch the formal ceremony. Elsewhere, residents of the town of Elizabeth in South Australia paid tribute to their home’s namesake.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p>The Conservative Party of Canada on Saturday picked populist Pierre Poilievre to lead the party and challenge sitting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poilievre, a lifelong conservative who first snagged a seat in Canada’s Parliament in 2004, supported the weeks-long “Freedom Convoy” of Canadian truckers protesting vaccine requirements and other COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up against four other candidates, Poilievre was declared the winner with 68 percent of the vote, according to the CBC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canada’s Conservatives have lost three elections to Trudeau, and are now rallying behind Poilievre’s potential to unseat the Liberal leader. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The party voted to oust former leader Erin O’Toole, who assumed the role in 2020, earlier this year after he worked to keep his party close to center on some issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Congratulations to @PierrePoilievre on his decisive victory in the @CPC_HQ leadership. Conservatives need to be united, strong and compassionate as we earn the trust of more Canadians to bring the country together,” O’Toole wrote on Twitter Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poilievre has positioned himself in opposition to what he sees as the Canadian establishment and Liberal policies on topics like the economy and the pandemic — and worked to appeal to Canadians frustrated with government \"calling the shots and dictating how you should live your life,\" according to his campaign site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Tonight begins the journey to replace an old government that costs you more and delivers you less with a new government that puts you first—your paycheck, your retirement, your home, your country,\" Poilievre said in an address Saturday, in video shared by CPAC. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An election date for a Poilievre-Trudeau matchup hasn't been set, and could be held off until as late as 2025, according to the Wall Street Journal, due to an agreement between Canada's New Democrats party and the minority Liberal government. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trudeau took to Twitter to congratulate Poilievre and note that “as Parliamentarians, we must work together to deliver results for people across the country. Canadians expect – and deserve – nothing less.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>Voters will be heading to the polls in New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Delaware next Tuesday to weigh in on some of the last primaries this year before turning their attention to November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the spotlight will be on New Hampshire’s Republican Senate primary, which will determine who takes on Sen. Maggie Hassan (D) in November, next week’s primaries will prove consequential in several gubernatorial and House races as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those primaries will determine whether Govs. Dan McKee (D) of Rhode Island and Chris Sununu (R) of New Hampshire prevail in their reelection bids, while several races in New Hampshire will determine who will take on two vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the House.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a look at the races we’re watching next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New Hampshire GOP Senate primary</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next week’s primary will be closely watched as Republicans determine which candidate they want to see go head to head with Hassan, who is vying for a second term in one of the year’s most competitive Senate races. She won her first term in 2016 by about a tenth of a percentage point, and Republicans are eager to see the seat flip. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the field has attracted close to a dozen GOP candidates, retired Army Gen. Don Bolduc and state Senate President Chuck Morse are seen as the leading candidates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bolduc has garnered controversy for previously supporting former President Trump’s claims that he won the 2020 election — claims from which Bolduc has recently backtracked — and for calling Sununu a “communist sympathizer.” He ran for Senate in 2020, losing the GOP nomination to Republican candidate Corky Messner. Messner later lost to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D) by a 15-percentage point margin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morse, considered the more establishment Republican, has focused on school choice, completing the wall at the southern border and reforming supply chain regulations. In a last-minute boost, Sununu announced on Thursday that he would be endorsing Morse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Republicans and Democrats have poured money into the race. Republicans have spent money airing ads criticizing Bolduc, whom some in the GOP worry would be a weak candidate against Hassan, while Democrats have aired ads targeting Morse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the seat as “lean Democrat.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New Hampshire GOP gubernatorial primary</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sununu is seeking his fourth run for office after dashing hopes held among some Republicans that he would run for Senate. While he’s competing against a handful of candidates in the GOP primary, recent polling shows he’s likely to prevail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among some of the candidates vying for the chance to take on Sununu include U.S. Marine Corps veteran Julian Acciard, “biker” candidate Jay Lewis, professional logger Richard McMenamon II, small business owner Thad Riley and Karen Testerman, who served in Franklin, N.H., as a former city councilor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite Republican candidates targeting him over his criticism of Trump and how he’s dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic, a University of New Hampshire Survey Center Granite State Poll released earlier this month shows Sununu on a likely easy reelection path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The poll found that Sununu received 72 percent support among likely Republican primary voters compared to Riley, who placed second at 7 percent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>New Hampshire 1st Congressional District GOP primary</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GOP primary to take on Rep. Chris Pappas (D.), who represents the state’s 1st Congressional District, has attracted a crowded field of candidates in a race that the nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates as a “toss up.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A University of New Hampshire Survey Center Granite State Poll released late last month showed two former Trump administration officials — former State Department official Matt Mowers (26 percent) and former White House assistant press secretary Karoline Leavitt (24 percent) — as the leading contenders among likely GOP primary voters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other candidates running in the race include journalist Gail Huff Brown — the wife of former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) — former state Sen. Russell Prescott and state Rep. Tim Baxter, among others. If Mowers wins reelection, it would set up a rematch with Pappas. The two went head to head in 2020, with Pappas prevailing by a 5-percentage point margin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Leavitt notches the GOP primary and wins the seat in November, she could be among the first Gen Z candidates to win office. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>New Hampshire 2nd Congressional District GOP primary</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voters will weigh in on seven Republican candidates next Tuesday eager to take on Rep. Ann Kuster (D) in November for the state’s 2nd Congressional District. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among those vying for the Republican nomination include bar manager and bartender Scott Black; Bob Burns, a former deputy state director for Newt Gingrich’s 2012 presidential campaign; stone craft artist Michael Callis; Keene, N.H., Mayor George Hansel; Jay Mercer, a department head at New Hampshire Technical Institute and Rivier University; Army veteran Dean Poirier and Lily Tang Williams, who serves as supervisor of the checklist in Weare, N.H.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A University of New Hampshire Survey Center Granite State Poll released late last month showed Burns leading his Republican contenders with 32 percent among likely Republican primary voters, followed by Hansel with 18 percent. Williams placed third at 10 percent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cook Political Report rates the seat a “toss up.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rhode Island Democratic gubernatorial primary</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gov. Dan McKee (D) is looking to win his first full term as governor after he was elevated to the post in 2021 after then-Gov. Gina Raimondo (D) left office to serve as Commerce secretary under the Biden administration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>McKee, who prior to his governorship served as the state’s lieutenant governor between 2015 and 2021, is facing four other challengers for the state’s top post: state Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, former state Secretary of State Matt Brown, former CVS executive Helena Foulkes and physician Luis Daniel Muñoz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 12 News-Roger Williams University Poll released in August showed McKee leading his Democratic contenders with 28 percent of support among Democratic primary voters in the state. Gorbea followed in second with 25 percent while Foulkes received 14 percent. Brown and Muñoz both received less than 10 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cook Political Report rates the seat as “solid Democrat,” meaning whoever wins on Tuesday will be the heavy favorite in November. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rhode Island 2nd Congressional District Democratic primary</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rep. Jim Langevin (D) announced earlier this year that he would not be seeking reelection after serving for two decades in Congress, leaving the seat open in a race that Cook Political Reports rates as a “toss up.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While only one Republican is running on the GOP side, five candidates are looking to secure the Democratic nomination. Those include state General Treasurer Seth Magaziner; former state lawmaker David Segal; former Commerce Department official Sarah Morgenthau; small business owner Joy Fox; and Refugee Dream Center founder Omar Bah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another Democratic candidate, Spencer Dickinson, suspended “the active part of his campaign,\" The Providence Journal reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 12 News-Roger Williams University Poll released in August shows Magaziner leading the pack by double digits with 37 percent support among Democratic primary voters in the state, followed by Segal and Morgenthau both with 8 percent. Fox, Bah and Dickinson both received less than 5 percent.</p>",

As reported by Leopeva64 on Twitter, you can see below that the right-click contextual menu shows the option for “Search bing in sidebar for “internet’s favorite”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, anything you hightlight would show in quotations in the menu and it will point you to Google’s Search engine and not Bing, but clicking this option would pop open the Side Panel we’ve spoken so much about lately and show you a Google search for that term.</p>\n\n\n\nCredit: Leopeva64 on Twitter\n\n\n<p>Search web in side panel</p><p>Displays right-click search results of a highlighted text in side panel – Mac, Windows, Linux, ChromeOS, Fuchsia, Lacros</p>#search-web-in-side-panel\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, you can highlight text, right click and perform a standard search for it, but this update allows it to appear in that panel without forcing you to leave the page or open a new tab in your browser. For those who prefer to avoid the jarring feeling of entering into a new environment every few seconds while doing research, this looks like it will be a welcome update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now though, the developer flag is available to toggle, but the contextual option remains absent. It’s likely this will appear automatically with time for those who have enabled said flag, so long as Google continues with this experiment. Because it’s already been implemented in Edge, I don’t see any reason why this won’t be the case!</p>\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through wars, economic hardship, and even pandemics, Americans consistently resist the urge to turn inward, and instead reach up and out to do whatever it takes to help those in greatest need. Sept. 11, 2001 was one of those moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On that day, thousands of innocent souls were lost during attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and in Shanksville, Pa. Innumerable other lives were forever changed after loved ones were senselessly torn away. However, the heroism of first responders and everyday citizens inspired countless individuals from all walks of life to refocus their efforts on serving others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some took the ultimate risk by serving as members of our armed forces. Many donated their time and resources to local organizations. Others chose to meet their community’s needs by serving in AmeriCorps. Through unity and service, every one of these Americans upheld the virtues of honor, sacrifice, and selflessness—principles that have always been the greatest source of our nation’s strength.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brendan Butler is an amazing example. He was nearly 3,000 miles away from Ground Zero as he watched our shared tragedy unfold on the TV screen. Brendan subsequently turned his despair into action by serving as an AmeriCorps member with the Central Maryland Red Cross.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Armed with the knowledge that he would be trained immediately and sent to work near Ground Zero, Brendan was dispatched as part of the AmeriCorps VISTA program in Edison, N.J.: a suburb from which many commuted to their jobs at the World Trade Center. More specifically, Brendan served as an outreach specialist and conducted home visits to support victims’ families. Brendan’s time near Ground Zero and his work with AmeriCorps inspired him to pursue a lifetime of service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also Victoria Sharp, who on 9/11, was serving on her second day as an AmeriCorps member with the Atlanta Red Cross National Preparedness and Response Corps. Her time working alongside first responders and providing support for grieving loved ones in New York and New Jersey compelled the would-be artist to follow a career in disaster preparedness. Victoria went on to pursue a role at the Centers for Disease Control in the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Victoria remembers it, “joining AmeriCorps in 2001 was indeed a life-altering experience. It’s a (time) of my life for which I am most proud and will forever impact me wherever I go.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we approach another solemn anniversary of 9/11, we should remember the unity, courage and resolve of those days—exemplified by Victoria, Brendan and so many others. Twenty-one years later, Americans are continuing to serve with kindness in ways that unite neighbors in honoring those we lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, we invite you to join them and seek opportunities to serve together. 9/11 Day of Service &amp; Remembrance projects range from food drives and home repairs to neighborhood cleanups and disaster preparation activities. In many areas, volunteers will choose to honor members of the U.S. military and first responders by collecting donations, assembling care packages and writing thank you letters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, over the last two decades since 9/11, another thing has become painfully clear—Americans are increasingly confronting toxic polarization and division. In fact, a recent NBC News poll found that 70 percent of Americans agree the nation “has become so polarized that it can no longer solve the major issues facing the country — and that those differences will only continue to grow.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We cannot allow polarization to become the defining characteristic of our era. Amid our challenges, we continue to believe that social cohesion is critical to a healthy, resilient democracy — exactly what we worked to nurture and protect in the face of hate 21 years ago. Service fosters a sense of common purpose and helps build strong and lasting interpersonal connections, including with those who may think differently from us. More specifically, we know that service — a pathway to civic bridgebuilding — helps strengthen relationships between communities, cultivates mutual respect, reduces polarization, and creates a culture of civic responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know all of this because we’ve seen it. We’ve seen how service creates opportunities for people to develop bonds of trust through their shared stories. We’ve seen how it strengthens communities and changes students’ lives. And we’ve read numerous reports citing the physical and mental health benefits of service and volunteerism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we roll up our sleeves together to do the hard work of rebuilding and repairing, we see each other’s humanity. That’s how, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, we disrupt division, transform communities and strengthen our nation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit americorps.gov/911Day to learn how to get involved in your community on this 9/11 Day and all year long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael D. Smith is the current Chief Executive Officer of AmeriCorps. Barbara Stewart is the former CEO of AmeriCorps and Trustee &amp; Executive Director of the Bowe Stewart Foundation.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Meteorologists have predicted that a “triple-dip” La Niña is expected to occur through the remainder of 2022 and possibly into early 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an update on Thursday, the National Weather Service reported a 91 percent chance of La Niña conditions in the months of September through November, decreasing to 54 percent January through March of 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Word Meteorological Organization (WMO), La Niña is a climate pattern caused by large-scale cooling of the ocean surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current La Niña has spanned three consecutive northern hemisphere winters starting in September 2020, making this the century’s first “triple-dip“ La Niña, WMO said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>La Niña is also the opposite of the widely-known El Niño, which only occurs when the Pacific Ocean water is higher than normal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The weather conditions will mean less rain and drier conditions this fall for most of the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WMO’s Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said the weather event is slowing the rise in temperatures around the globe, “but it will not halt or reverse the long-term warming trend.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every state in the U.S., apart from those closer to the Canadian border, are expecting to see above-average temperatures forecast through the fall season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another season of La Niña could spell trouble for California, which has suffered through intense, prolonged drought seasons in the past few years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>States such as New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Colorado are also expected to see hotter than usual temperatures during the fall season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to ABC News, La Niña has had a devastating impact outside the U.S., causing droughts in South America and eastern parts of Africa and floods in Asia.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, the first woman to clinch a major-party nomination for president, on Sunday responded to skepticism from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) that a woman could hold the nation’s highest office.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think that a woman will become our president at some point,\" Clinton said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I certainly understand all of the obstacles you have to overcome to get there. But I continue to tell young women and girls that if they feel motivated to pursue political office, they should do so, with their eyes wide open about how hard it is.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an interview with GQ earlier this month, Ocasio-Cortez — herself an oft-cited name as a potential future presidential candidate — said her experience as a congresswoman showed her “how deeply and unconsciously, as well as consciously, so many people in this country hate women.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Misogyny, Ocasio-Cortez said, “transcends political ideology,” and the patriarchy permeates all parties. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second-term congresswoman talked about hearing from girls who say they want to see her as president, saying, “I admit to sometimes believing that I live in a country that would never let that happen.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clinton, who won the popular vote against then-Republican candidate Donald Trump in 2016 but lost the electoral college count, acknowledged Ocasio-Cortez’s concerns, but said it was still worth fighting to get a woman winning the White House. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think it's sad that we have so many people who seem to either resent or oppose women in the public arena, whether it's politics and government or the media or anything else. That's something we have to keep standing up against and speaking out against,” Clinton said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Unfortunately, social media, with all of its misogyny, has made it more difficult, but we can't be bullied into silence or giving up on our own dreams. We have to continue to pursue them and encourage others to do the same.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clinton, who became former President Obama's secretary of state after losing to him in the 2008 Democratic primary for president, has been open about a number of her own battles with misogyny and sexism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She revealed last week that she started wearing her now-mainstay pantsuits after press circulated \"suggestive\" photographs shot up the then-First Lady's skirt. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On tour with daughter Chelsea to promote their women-focused docu-series “Gutsy,” Clinton also said last week that she won’t run again for president.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“But I’m going to do everything I can to make sure that we have a president who respects our democracy and the rule of law and upholds our institutions,” Clinton told CBS News. </p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/international/3638133-ukraines-latest-counteroffensive-fuels-optimism-about-russian-defeat/",
        "description": "<p>Ukraine launched a massive counteroffensive against Russian troops in the eastern region of the country last week, forcing the Russians to retreat from key cities and settlements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Russia continues to hold onto large parts of Ukraine, experts say the Ukrainian rout of Russian forces in Kharkiv could be a sign of a major shift in the war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN anchor Dana Bash the gains indicated a weakening Russian position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Let's see how this plays out,\" Warner said on \"State of the Union\" on Sunday. \"The Ukrainians are demonstrating their will to fight, and that's one of the things you can never fully estimate no matter how good your intelligence is. And, candidly, the Russians' inability and lack of supplies to their troops is playing out as well.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warner noted Russia had expected a counteroffensive in the south, not in the northeastern Kharkiv region, where its forces were forced out of at least 40 settlements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fighting continues in the regional cities of Kupiansk and Izium, according to an intelligence update from the United Kingdom's Defense Ministry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky remained optimistic on Sunday. Zelensky told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday that his troops are \"slowly, gradually moving forward\" until Ukraine reclaims all of the lost territory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We have no other way. And it’s not our weakness. I believe it’s our strength,\" Zelensky said. \"Because Russia does have a way out. They can go back home. We have only this home to defend.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The counteroffensive could provoke a more aggressive reaction from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who last week promised to \"carry it through\" to the end, in response to a question about the war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, tweeted Sunday that Russia attacked power stations and critical infrastructure in \"an act of desperation\" following \"immense losses and retreat in eastern Ukraine.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Even with their terrorist tactics, they are doomed to lose this war,\" Nikolenko wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine's counteroffensive offers the latest cause for optimism in its efforts to expel Russian forces. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, his forces launched a blitz offensive with attacks across the country. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine pushed Russian troops out of the capitol region of Kyiv within a few months, forcing Russia to regroup and concentrate on taking territory in the east. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Russia succeeded in taking over key eastern cities —  including large parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions — Ukraine's counteroffensive has erased significant gains achieved over the spring and summer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The regional head of the Luhansk tweeted Saturday that Ukrainian troops were headed into the city of Lysychansk, a major city Russia captured over the summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said Russia is likely losing the larger war effort because of \"unclear goals.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Russia needed to be able to defend an enormous front line and control the areas it was occupying. Not an easy task,\" Lee tweeted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"It was never clear how Russia could achieve conflict termination, especially since Ukraine had a morale advantage,\" he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mick Ryan, an adjunct fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a Twitter thread Sunday that if Ukrainians overtake Kupiansk, a key rail hub, that would \"compromise Russian operations on their eastern front.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan also said the surprise counteroffensive \"introduces a larger psychological issue with Russians fighting in the east.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The Russians, while not beaten, are in real trouble,\" Ryan said. \"Ukraine now has the initiative in this war, as well as tactical and operational momentum going into winter. The war is not over, but perhaps the tide is finally turning.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Editor's note: A previous version of this story misidentified the Sunday show on which Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) appeared. </p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3636412-jan-6-panel-set-to-re-emerge-with-eye-on-newt-gingrich/",
        "description": "<p>The House panel investigating last year’s attack on the U.S. Capitol is set to revive the public portion of its probe this month, eyeing at least two more hearings in the coming weeks to highlight former President Trump’s role in the deadly rampage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Publicly, the inquiry into the Jan. 6 attack has been overshadowed in recent weeks by the FBI’s extraordinary seizure of thousands of government documents, including those alleged to be highly sensitive, from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Florida last month — part of a separate Justice Department investigation into Trump’s potential mishandling of federal records. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But behind the scenes, the Jan. 6 select committee has spent Congress’s long summer recess plugging away, interviewing a number of new witnesses while seeking the cooperation of several more, including such prominent GOP figures as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.), former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Vice President Mike Pence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The work has continued against the backdrop not only of the legal battle surrounding the FBI search, but of Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) losing her primary battle against a Trump-backed candidate. Despite Cheney’s loss, many Democrats think the focus in the headlines on Trump is helping their party ahead of the midterms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the House returns to Washington this week, the panel is promising to air its new findings in at least one public hearing this month, with another perhaps to follow in October — a schedule that would put Trump and his GOP supporters on the defensive heading into November’s midterm elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exact timing of the hearings, as well as the witness list, remain works in progress, according to members of the committee. But a central focus of the investigation throughout August was the wide-ranging effort by a long list of Trump supporters — some of them on Capitol Hill — to install slates of fake electors in certain battleground states where Trump has claimed, falsely, that he prevailed over President Biden. Gingrich, the committee has found, was a part of that effort. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Former House Speaker Gingrich appears to have been involved in some of the planning around the counterfeit electors scheme, and efforts to substitute a fraudulent process for the actual process,” a member of the select committee said in an interview. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another member of the committee, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), said Gingrich’s campaign to keep Trump in the White House did not stop even after Congress voted to certify Biden’s victory in the aftermath of the failed insurrection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We also have information about his efforts to get the election overturned, even after the riot on the 6th,” Lofgren told CNN earlier this month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the chairman of the select committee, delivered a letter to Gingrich this month seeking his “voluntary cooperation.” The request cited Gingrich’s communications with several top Trump advisers — including Meadows, Jared Kushner and Jason Miller — about methods to reverse the election outcome and suggested Gingrich may have been in direct touch with Trump on the subject.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snippets of Gingrich’s emails obtained by the panel reveal he had suggested line edits for a post-election TV ad in Georgia, where Trump was defeated, promoting conspiracy theories around voter fraud. The message, Gingrich advised, should include reference to a “call to action.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The goal is to arouse the country’s anger,” Gingrich wrote to Kushner and Miller, adding that viewers “will then bring pressure on legislators and governors.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These advertising efforts were not designed to encourage voting for a particular candidate,” Thompson wrote to Gingrich. “Instead, these efforts attempted to cast doubt on the outcome of the election after voting had already taken place.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sept. 1 letter was a clear sign that the committee’s investigation is far from over, while raising new questions about what remaining figures could be implicated as its work continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meadows, it was already known, is one of them. While Trump’s former chief of staff had delivered thousands of text messages to investigators last year, he has refused to speak with the panel, even under subpoena. The House held Meadows in contempt of Congress last year, but the Justice Department declined to bring charges. The standoff remains under litigation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some members of the select committee are also interested in speaking with Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist and wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who had sought to overturn the 2020 election and solicited the help of several well-placed figures, including Meadows and John Eastman, a conservative lawyer who had drafted the dubious legal reasoning on which the “stop the steal” effort relied. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Speaking as one member and only as one member, I would say she has a relevant testimony to render, and she should come forward and give it,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), another member of the select committee, said earlier this month in an appearance on CBS’s “Face the Nation” program. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don't want to overstate her role — we've talked to more than 1,000 people,” Raskin continued. “But we'd like to hear from Gingrich and we’d like to hear from her, too.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still another figure of interest is Tony Ornato, a former Secret Service agent who doubled as Trump’s deputy chief of staff. Ornato has already spoken with investigators, but they want him back to clarify discrepancies in testimony surrounding Trump’s alleged clash with his security detail on the day of the Capitol attack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We do want to talk to him again,” Lofgren told CNN. “There are a lot of things that just don't add up, to me, on what the Secret Service has said and the material that we're getting.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also largely unexplored by the committee are Trump’s actions in the window between the Capitol attack of Jan. 6 and Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20 — a time period during which Trump’s own Cabinet members were considering invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The committee has hinted at that effort in clips shown of a conversation with Trump’s Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia — who penned a memo urging Trump to stop questioning the election results — as well as in a letter to Fox News host Sean Hannity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You appear also to have detailed knowledge regarding President Trump’s state of mind in the days following the January 6th attack. For example, you appear to have had a discussion with President Trump on January 10th that may have raised a number of specific concerns about his possible actions in the days before the January 20th inaugural,” the committee wrote to the popular pundit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The committee has also suggested it could imminently release a report on the National Guard’s hours-long delay in getting to the Capitol to defuse the violence on Jan. 6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But time is running short. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Democrats expected to lose control of the House in the midterms, the panel will have to wrap up its investigation before year’s end, or Republicans will pull the plug on it. With that in mind, the panel is expected to issue an interim report on its findings before November’s elections, with its final report to follow later in the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When the final report is released, the committee is dissolved,” Lofgren said earlier this summer. “And so, so long as information continues to come in, we want to avoid that result. We don’t want to prematurely cut off witnesses who want to be heard.”</p>",

The victory completes a weekend sweep of the once-division-leading Twins.</p>\n<p>Bieber entered the fifth inning having allowed two total baserunners. Then, Nick Gordon slugged a lead-off double. A strikeout and a groundout followed, the latter allowing Gordon to advance to third. He scampered home when Gary Sánchez pulled this nonsense:</p>\n\n\n<p>Ope! pic.twitter.com/Y8p9hT3Tw9</p>— Minnesota Twins (@Twins) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve seen a batted ball hit the bag. Four of them were this season! </p>\n<p>No more intervention, divine or otherwise, further blotted Bieber’s record. He finished the game with 6.1 IP, 5 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 7 K. It took a little bit of help from his friends, though.</p>\n<p>Sam Hentges answered the call in the seventh inning. Upon arrival, runners stood at first and third threatening Bieber’s ERA and the Guardians’ lead. A six-pitch battle with Jermaine Palacios ended with a lineout, then Hentges struck out Sánchez on three pitches. If the entire season is considered, this was likely one of the higher-leverage situations for the Guardians this year. Hentges did not flinch.</p>\n<p>He also retired the first batter in the eighth before Trevor Stephan downed two more on five pitches. Karinchak added suspense by walking two in the bottom of the ninth, but in his typical fashion he also struck out the side to win the game.</p>\nCorner Pieces\n\nOwen Miller’s defense at first base invites complaints so it is worth celebrating the excellent pick he made in the eighth. Amed Rosario nearly suffered from a one-cent throw after his million dollar play up the middle, but Miller’s quick reaction locked in the out.\nMyles Straw’s offense invites complaints so it is paramount to celebrate his three-hit afternoon. \nJosé Ramírez slugged his 40th double. It is unlikely that he’ll mash another fourteen bombs and reach the 40-40 plateau, but 30-40 seasons are cool, too. \nIt could have been an absolute blowout. The Guardians went 1-10 with runners in scoring position and stranded twelve runners overall.\n\nWait, What?\n<p>Josh Naylor’s double in the ninth inning should probably be revised to an error.</p>\n\n\n<p>Insurance like Progressive.#ForTheLand pic.twitter.com/q2kfB04kyR</p>— Cleveland Guardians (@CleGuardians) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>He put the ball in play and two runs scored so this is not at all a complaint about Naylor. I just... don’t let those defenders off the hook! Because they did not each receive an error on this play, I think we should all watch it loop about ten more times while chuckling. Sensibly, of course.</p>\nWhat’s next?\n<p>The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim send Reid Detmers to the mound to duel Konnor Pilkington. Weapon of choice is likely to be a baseball for each, but we’ll see.</p>",

        "description": "Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Offense was at a premium on a dreary, rainy day at Camden Yards.</p> <p>The Orioles postseason hopes took yet another hit on Sunday afternoon as the punchless offense wasted a terrific pitching performance from Kyle Bradish, leading to a 1-0 loss to the Red Sox at Camden Yards.</p>\n<p>Dreary weather in Baltimore caused an hour-long rain delay prior to first pitch. Perhaps this was a welcome respite on the first full day of the 2022 NFL season for those looking to avoid a constant jiggling of their remote’s “Previous Channel” button. It sure seemed like the hitters of both teams were in a rush to get back to the dugout and check in on their fantasy teams. The starting pitching combo of Rich Hill and Kyle Bradish stymied opposing hitters for most of the afternoon.</p>\n<p>Orioles manager Brandon Hyde deployed a lineup that had a JV feel to it. Adley Rutschman got the day off, as is typical for a catcher on Sunday afternoons. He was joined on the pine by Gunnar Henderson and Cedric Mullins. It was a conscious decision to go with an overwhelmingly right-handed lineup against the southpaw Hill. Unfortunately, that strategy failed.</p>\n<p>Hill needed 77 pitches to get through five scoreless innings. The Orioles did threaten to score on the veteran a couple of times, but nothing came to fruition. Their best opportunity presented itself in the fifth inning, when a hit by pitch for Rougned Odor and a walk to Robinson Chirinos flipped the lineup over with no outs. But a failed bunt attempt from Ryan McKenna followed by strikeouts from Anthony Santander and Ryan Mountcastle quickly fizzled that hopeful rally.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bradish kept his team right on the Red Sox heels. The only run allowed by the rookie came in the first inning. Tommy Pham led off the game with a single, stole second base, moved to third on a ground out, and then scored on a Xander Bogaerts sacrifice fly.</p>\n<p>It was one of those starts where Bradish was not blowing the ball by the Boston lineup. His fastball velocity was down quite a bit in the rain conditions. Instead, he pitched to contact and took advantage of three double plays to get out of trouble in the fourth, fifth, and seventh innings. Three of his last four starts have gone seven or more innings.</p>\n<p>This outing brought Bradish’s season ERA down to 5.01, more than two points lower (7.38) than it was before he went on the IL in mid-June. The Orioles want Bradish to be a rotation piece long term. That was becoming tougher to see a few months ago, but now he looks like a key cog in the rotation both now and moving forward.</p>\n<p>After Hill exited the game, the Orioles only threatened to score once. In the seventh inning, Odor led off with another hit by pitch. He moved to second on a balk and then swiped third. But once again the top of the lineup could not come through. McKenna grounded out, and Santander struck out.</p>\n<p>The trio of Henderson, Rutschman, and Mullins did all make appearances as pinch hitters. Henderson took Jesús Aguilar’s spot and ended up making two trips to the plate, including a walk. Mullins and Rutschman both entered in the ninth as a last gasp effort to snag a win. But it didn’t happen.</p>\n<p>The Orioles offense had just three total hits and four walks. They went 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position. Just as it has been for a few weeks nows, the lineup lacks any amount of pop. However, in an odd twist, Austin Hays managed multiple hits and a walk, perhaps breaking out of his lengthy funk at the plate.</p>\n<p>It’s tough to make a case for Aguilar’s continued inclusion in the lineup. Small sample sizes and all that, but he is 1-for-18 with six strikeouts and no walks in an Orioles uniform. Add in his struggles with the Marlins earlier in the year. It makes more sense to give his DH at-bats to someone like Kyle Stowers at this point, even against a left-handed pitcher.</p>\n<p>The Orioles aren’t sunk yet, but they are not trending in the right direction. They have lost two straight series and five of their last seven games. A two-game, midweek sweep of the lowly Nationals is a requirement.</p>\n<p>Following an off day on Monday, D.C. is the destination on Tuesday. Dean Kremer toes the slab for a 7:05 first pitch from Nationals Park.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

They must average 28,557 tickets sold for the 10 remaining dates to reach 2.6 million for the season. The last time the Cubs announced fewer than 2.6 million tickets sold in a full-capacity season (2020 and 2021 excluded) was 1997.\n\nHAPP-ENINGS: Ian Happ hit two doubles Saturday and now has 38 for the season. With two more doubles and four more home runs, he would become the seventh player in Cubs history to hit 20 HR and have 40 doubles in a season. The others: Javier Báez (2018), Anthony Rizzo (2013, 2016), Alfonso Soriano (2007, 2010), Aramis Ramirez (2008), Derrek Lee (2005, 2007, 2008) and Rogers Hornsby (1929).\n\nTHE NICO FILES: Nico Hoerner has gone 30 straight plate appearances without striking out. Hoerner has struck out just once every 9.31 plate appearances, which leads the NL. \n\nGOT TO HOLD THOSE LEADS: The Cubs have scored first in 82 games this season, including Saturday, but are just 41-41 in those games. The 82 games scoring first are third-most behind the Astros (83) and the Mets (83) and the 41 losses are most in the majors.\n\n<p>Here are today’s particulars.</p>\n<p>Cubs lineup:</p>\n\n\n<p>Here is tonight's #Cubs starting lineup for the series finale against the Giants. pic.twitter.com/DjcVciEiIj</p>— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The Giants lineup was not available at posting time.

It’s entirely possible that Miley will be piggybacked by Wesneski again tonight.</p>\n<p>Miley last faced the Giants May 19, 2021 and a fair number of those guys aren’t on the Giants anymore, so... feel free to ignore that boxscore link. Current Giants are hitting .227 (20-for-88) against Miley. Evan Longoria has homered three times against him.</p>\n<p>John Brebbia threw an inning in Saturday’s game so it’s clear he’s being used as an opener tonight. He’s done this four other times this year, including last Tuesday against the Dodgers, where he threw a scoreless first inning.</p>\n<p>He’s been one of the better middle relief guys in the NL this year and he leads MLB in appearances with 65.</p>\n<p>Other than that, let’s hope the Cubs get to him early. He’s a two-pitch pitcher (see below).</p>\n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \n<p></p>\n<p>Today’s game is on ESPN.</p>\n<p>Here is the complete MLB.com Mediacenter for today.</p>\n<p>MLB.com Gameday</p>\n<p>Baseball-reference.com game preview</p>\n<p>Please visit our SB Nation Giants site McCovey Chronicles.

The everso-patient New York lineup - which has seen the 5th most pitches on average per plate appearance at 4.69 - forced Luzardo to throw 91 pitches in his sub-4 inning outing.

        "description": "Tony La Russa may not be back in 2022, or in the dugout ever again, after more detail has been learned about his medical condition. | Aaron Josefczyk-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Both things can be true: Tony has been a lousy manager for the White Sox, and we want him to stay strong and stick around for his family</p> <p>Neither Tony La Russa nor the White Sox got ahead of this story to address it, but we now know the crux of La Russa’s medical issue: He was suffering from heart failure, and had a pacemaker installed.</p>\n\n\n<p>White Sox manager Tony La Russa confirms to me he had a pacemaker inserted for his heart. He is grateful for having undergone a relatively \"simple\" procedure and is coming along well, working to regain his strength. It's unclear when he'll be ready to manage again.</p>— Janie McCauley (@JanieMcCAP) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>It’s telling that La Russa confirmed this to a Bay Area media member and not to anyone covering the White Sox, and that the club did not have anything prepared in advance for the moment when it would be learned that its manager was nodding off in the dugout due to his heart running slow.</p>\n<p>Certainly, this news puts a different spin on Tony’s troubles this year, including the embarrassing footage of him falling asleep in-game. Perhaps if the team, or Tony, was a little more forthright with information dispensed to media and fans, folks (including us) would have been slower to grab our pitchforks and torches over this disappointing, middling ball club — or taken a more concerned tone.</p>\n<p>It’s not to say that Tony doesn’t merit criticism for the team performance this year, or his puzzling decisions and obstinate attitude when asked to defend his process since he has returned to the White Sox. But regarding the mockery we put out there on the White Sox, full-throated, for employing a manager falling asleep in the dugout, we understand better now and will not repeat it. </p>\n<p>We do want Tony to pay attention to what his body is telling him and to stay strong for his family, and want the White Sox to be responsible and prevent him from returning to the strain and stress of the big-league grind for the rest of this season. </p>\n<p>Just a day ago, Tony’s return to the game seemed to be coming as soon as Tuesday, with the White Sox hosting the Colorado Rockies. Now, it seems the smart course of action will be to have the mentor carry on with multiple conversations per day with acting manager Miguel Cairo, but remain out of the day-to-day scene.</p>\n<p>Best of continued health to La Russa, who despite a star-crossed return to the team, is a White Sox legend and family member.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>White Sox manager Tony La Russa has been on a health-related leave of absence since August 30, but he met with his team in person in Oakland this weekend.  La Russa was given the go-ahead by doctors to make the trip from his home in Arizona, as La Russa wanted to be in attendance when Dave Stewart had his number retired by the Athletics today.</p>\n<p>Meeting with reporters (including Janie McCauley of The Associated Press and Daryl Van Schouwen of the Chicago Sun-Times) today, the 77-year-old La Russa said it was still “uncertain” about whether or not he would be able to return to the White Sox dugout.</p>\n<p>“I don’t plan to be in uniform until [doctors] say it’s time to be in uniform,” La Russa said. “I don’t know if they want me at the park or not.  The most important thing for me is you don’t want to be a distraction.  I don’t want to be a distraction.  That’s why it’s best to let it run its course, and in the meantime [the team is] concentrating on the game they’re playing.”</p>\n<p>The exact nature of La Russa’s health problem wasn’t known, but he told McCauley that he had a pacemaker inserted.  The manager told the media that he also had a heart issue during Spring Training, and on August 30, doctors “had some information they needed to address” about the problem that required La Russa to immediately step away from the White Sox.  “They fixed it, now it’s a question of regaining strength….I’ve had my issue fixed, I’m mending,” La Russa noted.</p>\n<p>La Russa hasn’t entirely stepped away, as he said he still makes multiple calls per day to bench coach and acting manager Miguel Cairo.  The Sox have posted a 9-3 record in La Russa’s absence, a surge has kept Chicago in the hunt for the AL Central title and on the outskirts of the wild card race.  Apart from three games against the Padres and four games against the division-leading Guardians, the White Sox have one of the easier remaining schedules of any team in baseball, making them a team to watch down the stretch.</p>",

It is one of multiple social media posts purportedly of photos and videos of recently liberated Ukrainians celebrating the recent gains. </p><p>The deputy mayor of Izium, Volodymyr Matsokin, confirmed in a Telegram post that the armed forces of Ukraine are in the city, but said it's too early to say the city has been liberated. He says the military is working on it.</p><p>In his nightly address Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed that more than 30 settlements in the Kharkiv region had been \"liberated\" so far. </p><p>While Russia's Ministry of Defense and the Kremlin have not officially acknowledged the counteroffensive, Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov confirmed that Moscow's forces withdrew from the city of Izium — a key regional transportation and supply hub for the Russian military in Ukraine's east. </p><p>\"... to liberate Donbas it was decided to regroup the Russian troops in the area of Balakliya and Izium to scale up efforts in Donetsk direction,\" Konashenkov said in a video, even as Russian state media reporters on the ground insisted the move was taken to avoid a rout by Ukrainian forces.</p><p>Videos posted to social media showed long lines of cars piled up at the Russian border after occupying authorities called for a civilian evacuation.</p><p>A recent analysis by the Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington D.C., said that successes in the Kharkiv counteroffensive \"are creating fissures within the Russian information space\" and \"eroding confidence\" in Russian command.   </p><p>Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "Photo by Tim Warner/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>With Sunday’s showing, the Astros reached 90 wins!</p> <p>On Sunday, the Astros showed what their offense is capable of doing. They smacked five home runs, including a grand slam, to defeat the Angels 12-4 and took their final series of the season. Besides Alex Bregman’s bases-loaded bomb, Houston also saw homers from Mauricio Dubón, Trey Mancini, Yordan Álvarez, and Kyle Tucker. Houston is closing the campaign with a 13-6 record against the Halos.</p>\n<p>Astros’ starter Luis García got in trouble in the first two innings of the game, allowing two and one runs, respectively. Shohei Ohtani launched his 34th long ball of the season in the first while Andrew Velazquez hit his ninth to make it 3-0 in the third.</p>\n<p>However, the Astros were able to come back with a five-run third inning that featured Dubón’s solo shot (5) and Bregman’s slam (21). It was the first grand slam for Bregman since 2019 (also against the Angels) and the fourth of his career.</p>\n\n\n<p>On the board. pic.twitter.com/A6nHUdXl0w</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Breggy slam. pic.twitter.com/JU5gC8gmgQ</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Those two blasts only got the party started for Houston. In the fifth, after a walk to Kyle Tucker and a single from Yuli Gurriel, Trey Mancini clubbed his seventh dinger in 32 games as an Astro to give the team and García an even more comfortable 8-3 lead.</p>\n\n\n<p>Trey to the train tracks!   pic.twitter.com/NE2EH4l7gw</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>García picked his 12th win of the season (12-8) as he managed to complete five innings despite an awful start to the game – he surrendered a triple to Mickey Moniak, a Shohei Ohtani homer, and a Taylor Ward single. But after that, he allowed five hits across four scoreless innings to end his labor. </p>\n<p>In the eighth, Yordan Álvarez’s power appeared again after a long absence. Álvarez rocketed a 408-foot home run for his number 32 in 2022 – his second one since August 1. In the same inning, Tucker hit his 25th four-bagger of the season, a two-run shot that made it 12-3.</p>\n\n\n<p>Stros lead by a touchdown. pic.twitter.com/F1lCnKtsrB</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Crush city. pic.twitter.com/uMKPlZR45f</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>It was all a matter of time for the Astros to seal the win. With García gone after five, Bryan Abreu, Ryne Stanek, Will Smith, and Héctor Neris combined for three hits and one earned run over four innings to get the job done.</p>\n<p>From Monday to Wednesday, the Astros will visit Comerica Park to play a three-game series against the Tigers. Framber Valdez is the announced starter for Houston while the Tigers have yet to name theirs.</p>\n<p>VIDEOS AND BOX SCORE HERE.</p>",

        "description": "Gregory Fisher-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>An early home run barrage — though none by Judge — made this one a laugher after the rain subsided. </p> <p>A long rain delay, a starter going on short rest, a team that always seems to annoy the Yankees — today’s game could have been quite the slog. But the Yankees’ offense absolutely crushed the Rays’ Luis Patiño, led by two home runs from Gleyber Torres. New York had 10 runs by the end of the second inning, so the rest of the game was mostly an exercise in seeing if rain would end things early while observing steady work from the bullpen. </p>\n<p>In what was perhaps a bit of gamesmanship by manager Aaron Boone, starter Domingo Germán only pitched one inning, essentially acting as an opener. He allowed a leadoff walk, but no damage in his appearance on three days’ rest.</p>\n<p>It didn’t come on a barrage of singles, but the Yankees did stake a decent first-inning lead for the second day in a row. Aaron Judge led things off with a bloop single, then Patiño walked Giancarlo Stanton. Torres, who has been looking better of late, then gave the Yankees a quick three-run lead with a home run to left center.</p>\n\n\n<p>Gleyber Gone   pic.twitter.com/7I3k9WkhoO</p>— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Lucas Luetge emerged for the second inning as the second pitcher of the bullpen day. He allowed two soft singles and a force out, giving the Rays one run. Greg Weissert was brought on and got the final out.</p>\n<p>Patiño was clearly struggling with his command, but as the broadcast pointed out, the Rays didn’t have the luxury of pulling him too early. Unlike the Yankees, the Rays play tomorrow and have a doubleheader on Tuesday against the Blue Jays. In the second, that hurt them. </p>\n<p>Patiño walked Isiah Kiner-Falefa and Kyle Higashioka to start the inning, then allowed a smashed single to Marwin González to load the bases for Judge with no outs. A slam to bring him closer to 62 home runs would have been nice, but he hit a sacrifice fly to bring in the fourth run — still good.</p>\n<p>That brought up Stanton, who flicked the ball to right for a three-run home run. If he can start doing that again, that’ll be huge.</p>\n\n\n<p>Big G for three   pic.twitter.com/fOUeQTBQSa</p>— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>How about going back-to-back too? Torres got his second home run in as many innings, fouling off a lot of pitches before pulling one into the stands in left.</p>\n\n\n<p>G-absolute-Unit. pic.twitter.com/jbKn1idSJO</p>— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Patiño walked Josh Donaldson before finally being pulled by Kevin Cash. He was replaced by Calvin Faucher, who dished up Oswaldo Cabrera’s first big league home run!</p>\n\n\n<p>Watch it go, Oswaldo   pic.twitter.com/9dCZDnlNBA</p>— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Two innings in, 10 runs were on the board, and that was all she wrote. The Yankees thankfully made the rest of the proceedings almost entirely stress-free. Wandy Peralta easily pitched through the third and the fourth, as well as the first out of the fifth. He gave way to Lou Trivino, who completed the inning with an assist from a jumping catch by IKF to snare a line drive.</p>\n\n\n<p>Izzy bouncy? Yes, he is. pic.twitter.com/7cIrXo5MLu</p>— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The Rays did strike for two more runs in the top of the sixth. Trivino allowed a leadoff single to Randy Arozarena before being replaced by Ron Marinaccio. After Arozarena advanced to second on a David Peralta groundout, a Christian Bethancourt double down the left field line and a Taylor Walls single brought in two. Marinaccio did strike out Jonathan Aranda and Jose Siri to end the inning.</p>\n<p>Ryan Yarbrough was a lifesaver for the Rays, throwing five innings of relief with only two baserunners allowed. Meanwhile, Clarke Schmidt, back in his long relief role, was called on for the seventh and eighth. He allowed only one hit, striking out four. </p>\n<p>Clay Holmes, in need of work, came out for the ninth. He immediately walked Aranda, then struck out Siri. After a wild pitch allowed Aranda to advance to second, he scored on a single from Ji-Man Choi to make it 10-4. But Holmes followed up by freezing Isaac Paredes with good pitch on a corner for a strikeout looking, and Brandon Lowe lined out to wrap up the game.</p>\n<p>The Yankees are off tomorrow, then begin a two-game series in Boston on Tuesday night at 7:10pm ET. The Yankees haven’t announced who will start, but Nick Pivetta will go for the Sox.</p>\n<p>Box Score</p>",

        "description": "The Queen is the story, not the rudderless UK\n<p></p>\n<p>The media circus round Buckingham Palace has to be seen to be believed. TV networks from all over the world. My son Pete (who lives in London) cycled to the Palace on Friday out of curiosity and sent me a short video which gives you some idea of the scene. The death of no other monarch on earth, he surmised, would have attracted that kind of attention.</p>\n<p>He’s right. The Brexit crowd will doubtless interpret this level of attention as evidence for their conviction that the UK still really matters to the world. If so, it would be a be a serious misjudgement. The late Queen, not the UK, was the story – a head of state who played by the rules, even as they were being torn up by ‘her’ clueless Prime Ministers.</p>\n<p>Apropos that… after the Queen had passed away the current clueless PM stood outside Downing Street and said that she had been “the very spirit of Great Britain”, clearly unaware that Elizabeth II had been queen of the whole United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Which made one wonder (a) what the DUP loyalists over in Belfast made of their exclusion, and (b) how Truss will handle the upcoming crisis over the Northern Ireland Protocol which her predecessor signed and was trying to break before he left office.</p>\n\nQuote of the day\n\n<p>“In 1864 a notice was pinned to the rails of Buckingham Palace in the manner of an advertisement: “these commanding premises to be let or sold, in consequence of the late occupant’s declining business”.</p>\n\n\nDavid Cannadine in “The Context, Performance and Meaning of Ritual: The British Monarchy and the ‘Invention of Tradition’, 1820-1977”. \n\n\nLong Read of the Day\n<p>The short unhappy life of Elizabeth Windsor</p>\n<p>From Politico, the most interesting obituary I’ve read. It’s by ‘Otto English’ which is the pen name used by Andrew Scott, a writer and playwright based in London.</p>\n<p>TL;DR summary: To provide the United Kingdom with the monarch she felt it needed, Queen Elizabeth II sacrificed an ordinary life and the other things most of us take for granted.</p>\n<p>Worth your time.</p>\n\nMusical alternative to the morning’s radio news\n<p>Karl Jenkins | Benedictus | 2Cellos | Live, Zagreb</p>\n<p>Link</p>\n<p>Somehow, appropriate for this moment.</p>\n\nTesla gave us tech on wheels, so how come it forgot to include the service centres?\n<p>Yesterday’s Observer column:</p>\n\n<p>The first thing one learns when purchasing a Tesla, as this columnist did in December 2020, is that the neighbours immediately begin to hold one personally responsible for Elon Musk. The co-founder and now Supreme Leader of the company is, one finds, widely regarded by non-techies as a fruitcake with a bad Twitter habit, so it follows that anyone who buys one of his cars must be a devotee of the world’s richest nutter and therefore not properly earthed.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, there was a time, not so very long ago, 2005 to be precise, that this view of Musk was held by sensible German men in suits, who laughed at the idea of this jerk building automobiles. Didn’t he know that making cars is hard and that BMW, Mercedes, Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen, Toyota and the rest had spent the best part of a century figuring out how to do it profitably at scale? Sure, he might be able to produce expensive toys for Silicon Valley types – but real cars?</p>\n<p>The industry’s derisive scepticism reminds me of 2007, when Apple launched the iPhone…</p>\n\n<p>Read on</p>\n\nWhatever happened to Rudi?\n<p>Interesting NYT piece by Andrew Kirtzman on the accelerating self-destruction of the hero of 9/11.</p>\n\n<p>Rudy Giuliani led a terrified city through the deadliest attack in its history. As a reporter covering him from a few feet away that morning, I ran with him from the hurricane of ash and debris following the collapse of the World Trade Center’s North Tower, trekked a mile up a Manhattan avenue as he and his aides searched for safe harbor and watched his security detail break into a firehouse with a crowbar.</p>\n<p>He gave orders to aides calmly and decisively, reassured a frightened police officer, shushed a cheering crowd and spoke to the world from a tiny office. Like countless others, I was grateful that someone had taken charge, undaunted by the madness of the situation.</p>\n<p>These images often come to me when I try to reconcile that brilliant leader with the confused, widely ridiculed figure facing potential indictment for trying to subvert the 2020 election.</p>\n<p>Mr. Giuliani is virtually alone at this desperate hour…</p>\n\n<p>The thing that finally did for him, of course, was hooking up with Donald Trump. Sad but inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>This Blog is also available as a daily email. If you think that might suit you better, why not subscribe?

        "description": "<p>Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong is considering a bid on the Angels, according to Sportico’s Eric Jackson and Scott Soshnick.  The billionaire isn’t giving official comment, but Bill Shaikin of the Los Angeles Times heard that Soon-Shiong is indeed weighing the possibility of buying the franchise.  The 70-year-old Soon-Shiong is a former transplant surgeon who built a fortune in the medical technology and pharmaceutical industries, and his business holdings also include both the L.A. Times and San Diego Union-Tribune newspapers.</p>\n<p>This isn’t the first time Soon-Shiong has tried to get involved in baseball, as his ownership group was the runner-up bidder for the Dodgers in 2012 when Guggenheim Baseball Management bought the franchise.  Now, Soon-Shiong will apparently see if he can purchase the other Los Angeles area team, as Angels owner Arte Moreno said last month that he is considering a sale.  There is expected to be plenty of bidding on the Angels, and it seems quite possible that the price tag could end up approaching the $3 billion mark.</p>\n<p>More from around the AL West…</p>\n\nJustin Verlander threw a live bullpen session today, simulating one inning of work with some batters stepping in against the veteran righty.  Verlander has been on the 15-day injured list since August 29 due to calf discomfort, and he told MLB.com’s Brian McTaggert and other reporters that he hoped the session would give him more of a natural pitching feel, and allow him to “stop kind of thinking about the calf and just let my mechanics work…during rehab your throwing is very stagnant and robotic.”  Physically, Verlander said he is feeling “great,” and he is hopeful of a relatively quick return to the Astros rotation.  Since Verlander saw today’s outing as a pseudo-start day from a preparation standpoint, Verlander could potentially be back in action as early as September 16, provided that he doesn’t have any recovery issues from the bullpen session.\nThe Rangers will activate Jon Gray from the 15-day injured list on Monday, as interim manager Tony Beasley told reporters (including MLB.com’s Kennedi Landry) that Gray is slated to start the second game of Texas’ doubleheader against the Marlins.  Gray hasn’t pitched since August 1 due to an oblique strain, and he’ll return within the initial 4-6 week recovery timeline.  Between this oblique problem and previous IL stints due to a knee sprain and blisters, Gray has only pitched 103 1/3 innings in his first season with Texas, though he has a 3.83 ERA and solid peripherals.\nIn other Rangers injury news, the team announced that Spencer Howard will begin a rehab assignment at Triple-A today.  Howard has pitched only 37 2/3 innings in the majors this season, as he has been both in the minors and battling fingernail and blister problems before his most recent injury, a shoulder impingement.  This shoulder issue sidelined Howard about a month ago, and it remains to be seen if he can ramp up enough to make a return to the majors before the season is over.  The former top prospect has yet to show much at the MLB level, posting a 7.09 ERA over 111 2/3 career innings with the Phillies and Rangers.",

        "description": "Photo by Denis Poroy/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>That the Dodgers, owners of the best record in baseball, have qualified for the postseason, is not at all surprising. But in doing so Sunday, with a win over the Padres, the Dodgers became just the third MLB team to reach the playoffs ten years in a row.</p>\n<p>Before Sunday’s game, manager Dave Roberts said of making the playoffs, “It’s going to be an acknowledgement, it’s not going to be a celebration,” per SportsNet LA.</p>\n<p>With a magic number of only four to clinch the National League West, the Dodgers will earn their ninth division title in this 10-year run, only interrupted by a 106-win second-place season in 2021. The 10 straight playoff berths trail only the Braves, who won division titles in 14 straight completed seasons from 1991-2005, interrupted only by the 1994 strike; and by the Yankees, who made the postseason 13 straight years from 1995-2007.</p>\n<p>Over this 10-year run of success, the Dodgers are 916-580 (.612), with 72 (NYY) more victories than the next-best MLB team during that time.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers’ 96 postseason games played over the last nine seasons are far and away the most in MLB. The only team with more than half the Dodgers’ total is the Astros, with 79 playoff games since 2013.</p>\n<p>That .612 winning percentage is the second-best ten-year stretch in Dodgers franchise history. Brooklyn from 1946-55 won 61.4 percent of its games, a run that included a championship and six pennants in a time before divisional play. The current Dodgers stretch includes three pennants and a World Series win through the first nine years. This season will be the fourth time the Dodgers have the best record in the NL in the last six years.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers’ best 10-year stretch that included multiple championships was 1957-66, with a .560 win percentage and three World Series wins. </p>\n<p>With a little more than four weeks remaining in the regular season, these Dodgers still have time to capture the best 10-year winning percentage in franchise history. But it would require an 18-5 finish to this season, vaulting them to a .615 mark.</p>\n<p>The postseason starts on Friday, October 7 with the wild card series. Should the Dodgers retain their position among the top two records in the National League, they would earn a bye into the NL Division Series, which starts on Tuesday, October 11.</p>",

When you think he might be done, he reminds everyone of the offense his bat can still provide to the Dodgers.  </p>\n<p>After a mediocre first half, Turner has been hot in the second, hitting .330/.398/.524 in 118 plate appearances prior to today’s game.  On Sunday, Turner hit two home runs, one his second career grand slam, to lead the Dodger comeback for a 11-2 win.</p>\n\n\n<p>Is this why they call it Slam Diego? pic.twitter.com/YygNRXQHDm</p>— Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Justin Turner’s only other game with two home runs this season was also against the Padres and Joe Musgrove.  In that game, Turner hit both home runs against Musgrove.</p>\n<p>The win clinched a playoff spot and lowered their magic number to two as the Dodgers get ready to continue this three-city road trip in Phoenix.  It also meant the Dodgers had won all five series they have played against the Padres this season.  These two teams will play each other one more time at the end of the month in San Diego.</p>\n<p>At 96-43, the Dodgers are also 53 games over .500 for the first time this season.  </p>\n<p>Andrew Heaney started for the Dodgers and he got the win for his five inning outing.  Heaney did allow another home run, the 11th home run he had given up in Heaney’s last five starts.  </p>\n<p>Jake Cronenworth’s  solo home run in the second inning began the scoring in this game.  The Padres would make it 2-0 in the third inning.  Jose Azocar doubled off Justin Turner’s glove and would later score as Freddie Freeman could not field Juan Soto’ ground ball.</p>\n<p>Joe Musgrove seemed to be in a groove having pitched four scoreless innings.  But in the fifth inning, Justin Turner homered to center and one out later, Chris Taylor hit one over the left field wall to tie the game.</p>\n\n\n<p>Threatening with two homers. pic.twitter.com/UZ3AGyknT6</p>— Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>In the top of the sixth, Mookie Betts led off with a double and with one out, Freddie Freeman was intentionally walked.  Musgrove then hit Will Smith to load the bases.  Max Muncy followed with a two-run single to give the Dodgers their first lead of the game.</p>\n<p>That hit also sent the Padres starting pitcher to the bench.  Musgrove would pitch 5⅓ innings, allowing four runs and six hits.  </p>\n<p>Roberts Suarez would get the final two outs to limit the scoring to two runs.</p>\n<p>With the two-run lead, Alex Vesia relieved Heaney.  Heaney finished with five innings pitched, two runs (one unearned) and three hits allowed.  He would retire the Padres in order, striking out two.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers added on to their lead in the seventh.  Cody Bellinger singled to right and Betts hit his second double to put two runners in scoring position.  Trea Turner blooped a ball just out of Azocar’s and Bellinger beat the throw to make it 5-2.  </p>\n<p>After Freeman grounded out, Smith was intentionally walked to load the bases.  But then Muncy also walked to drive in another run.  All of those maneuvers were moot once Turner hit his second home run in the game to make it 10-2.</p>\n<p>The Padres had first-baseman Will Myers pitch the ninth inning and Trea Turner homered to push the final score to 11-2.  That home run meant Turner joins Davey Lopes and Pedro Guerrero has the two Dodger infielders to have at least 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases in a season.</p>\n\n\n<p>That stolen base was Trea Turner's 21st of the season. He also has 18 home runsOnly two Dodgers infielders had a 20/20 season:Davey Lopes (1979) 28 HR, 44 SBPedro Guerrero (1983) 32, 23https://t.co/fDvbVXgHqp</p>— Eric Stephen (@ericstephen) August 28, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Andre Jackson pitched the last two scoreless innings as the Dodgers will have yet another happy flight to their next destination.</p>\nSunday particulars\n<p>Home runs: Jake Cronenworth (16), Justin Turner 2 (13), Chris Taylor (9), Trea Turner (20)</p>\n<p>WP — Andrew Heaney (3-2): 5 IP, 3 hits, 2 runs (1 earned), 2 walks, 6 strikeouts</p>\n<p>LP — Joe Musgrove (9-7): 5⅓ IP, 6 hits, 4 runs, 1 walk, 5 strikeouts</p>\nUp next\n<p>The Dodgers will head to Phoenix to play their last series at Chase Field which begins Monday night.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/regulation/business/3638190-gas-prices-could-spike-again-this-winter-yellen-warns/",
        "description": "<p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Sunday warned that gas prices may spike again this winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yellen told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" that gas prices could rise due to the European Union largely halting Russian oil purchases this winter and banning provision of services that allow Russia to ship oil by tanker. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"It is possible that that could cause a spike in oil prices,\" Yellen said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Yellen noted a western price cap proposal was designed to balance curbing Russian oil revenues helping fund its war in Ukraine, while maintaining some access to Russian oil to \"hold down global oil prices.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"So I believe this is something that can be essential,\" she said. \"And it's something that we're trying to put in place to avoid a future spike in oil prices.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Group of Seven nations, which includes the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom, agreed to a price cap on Russian oil earlier this month. The nations did not say exactly what the cap would be yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move is designed to restrict Russian oil sales above a certain price. And if Russia moves to sell to friendlier nations, such as China or India, it will likely face higher service costs and competition from countries selling less expensive product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia, the world's third-largest oil producer, has threatened not to sell to countries that participate in the oil cap, which could further exacerbate a rise in global oil prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moscow has also effectively shut down a major gas pipeline to European nations, claiming it needs repairs, which could further shake up the world's energy sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After soaring to a national average of $5 per gallon earlier this year, gas prices have fallen to an average of $3.71 in the U.S., according to transportation organization AAA.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The Rockies pitching staff struggled as the offense once again had little to do against Zac Gallen.</p> <p>On a day where many were watching ugly week 1 NFL football, the Colorado Rockies played their final matchup of the season against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Rockies fell 12-6 while struggling against Diamondbacks ace and potential Cy Young candidate Zac Gallen. The pitching was also rough, as the Rockies pitching staff issued a combined nine walks and six stolen bases. This loss snaps a four game winning streak and moves the Rockies’ record to 61-80.</p>\nFeltner flatlines to highlight pitching woes\n<p>Rookie starter Ryan Feltner only lasted 2 2⁄3 innings in his outing this afternoon as he struggled to locate pitches. Feltner allowed four earned runs on four hits and four walks, though he did not allow a home run for just the fifth time in 16 appearances this season. Things collapsed for Feltner in the top of the third inning. After giving up back-to-back singles to begin the frame, an RBI groundout scored the Diamondbacks’ first fun. He then walked Daulton Varsho before inducing a pop-out With two outs and a runner on, it looked as though Feltner might escape relatively unscathed... before he collapsed. A walk to the aptly named Christian Walker followed by a single to rookie Stone Garrett pushed two more runs home. Then Walker and Garrett ran a double steal with Walker stealing home for the fourth run of the inning. Feltner walked two more batters after that before his outing was mercifully ended.</p>\nUgly bullpen made the game feel even longer\n<p>With Ryan Feltner lasting just 2 2⁄3 innings, the Rockies relied on six bullpen arms to make it through the rest of the game and it was largely ugly. The bright spots of the bullpen were Jhoulys Chacín’s 1 1⁄3 scoreless innings of work in relief of Feltner, and Chad Smith’s 1 1⁄3 scoreless innings split across the seventh and eighth. Where things really got hideous was in the seventh inning. Alex Colomé was given the ball to start the inning and only got one out. He walked the lead-off batter and allowed a single before striking out Corbin Carroll. However, the Diamondbacks pulled off another double steal on the strikeout. When Colomé walked Carson Kelly on five pitches he was pulled from the game in favor of lefty Austin Gomber. Then the inning got even longer. Gomber gave up a two run double to the first batter he faced, followed by two RBI singles to cap off an inning that lasted almost an hour where the Diamondbacks scored five runs. Dinelson Lamet gave up another two runs in the top of the ninth to cement the Rockies loss.</p>\nToo little, too late for Rockies offense\n<p>The Rockies once again had few answers for Zac Gallen, although they were able to snap his scoreless inning streak at 44 1⁄3 innings. All of their damage against him came in a three-run bottom of the fourth. Ryan McMahon, Yonathan Daza, and CJ Cron hit three quick singles to score the Rockies’ first run of the game. Gallen bounced back and struck out the next two batters, but Elehuris Montero hit a double to right that would score two more runs. Outside of that fourth inning, the Rockies didn’t put up any more runs or even have any more hits. Those four hits in the fourth were all that Gallen gave up in his six inning outing. Gallen struck out 11 Rockies batters and worked five 1-2-3 innings. He did not walk a single batter. The Rockies were able to draw some blood from reliever Ian Kennedy in the eighth inning. After Brian Serven was hit by a pitch, Ryan McMahon launched a two-run home run. Michael Toglia also had an RBI groundout. Unfortunately there was just too much of a deficit to overcome, as the Diamondbacks already had ten runs scored by that point and the Rockies’ three eighth inning runs only shortened the deficit to four.</p>\n\n\n<p>Elehuris Montero's 2-out, 2-run double pic.twitter.com/P83cvngALm</p>— RoxGifsVids (@RoxGifsVids) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>RyMac Jack! pic.twitter.com/XeSclktSPN</p>— RoxGifsVids (@RoxGifsVids) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\nComing Up Next\n<p>The Rockies are off on Monday before taking a trip to the Windy City for two games apiece against the White Sox and Cubs.

        "description": "<p>The Rockies took the field Sunday afternoon looking for a boffo final act to their homestand.</p>\n<p>They performed a pratfall instead.</p>\n<p>Playing one of their poorest games of the season, the Rockies lost 12-6 to Arizona at Coors Field in a game that took 3 hours, 46 minutes. The defeat ended the Rockies’ four-game winning streak and left them with a 4-2 record in their penultimate homestand of the season.</p>\n<p>It’s never a good sign when your pitchers issue more walks (9) than your batters register hits (6) — or when the latter strike out 14 times. But that’s what the Rockies did Sunday.</p>\n<p>“I think the (walks) were probably the biggest ugliness, especially against this group, that has some team speed on the bases,” Rockies manager Bud Black said. “They can run and apply some pressure.”</p>\n<p>And it’s never good when your starting pitcher throws just 37 strikes out of 70 pitches in 2 2/3 innings. But that’s what happened to right-hander Ryan Feltner.</p>\n<p>“I do believe I’ve been throwing the ball well before today,” Feltner said. “Today was just one of those days where I will just flush it and move on to the next one.</p>\n<p>“At the beginning (of the season) it was one step forward and two steps back. Now it feels like two steps forward and one step back. I think I’m making progress.”</p>\n<p>Arizona compounded Colorado’s misery by stealing six bases, including scoring a run by Christian Walker on a double steal in the third inning.</p>\n<p>At least the Rockies played a small part in Diamondbacks history. Right-hander Zac Gallen blanked the Rockies for three innings, extending his scoreless streak to 44 1/3 innings to set a franchise record. He bypassed Brandon Webb, who pitched 42 consecutive scoreless innings in 2007.</p>\n<p>Colorado halted Gallen’s streak with a three-run fourth inning. Ryan McMahon and Yonathan Daza rapped out back-to-back singles and C.J. Cron’s hard single past first baseman Christian Walker scored McMahon to snap the streak. Gallen struck out Charlie Blackmon and Michael Toglia, but rookie Elehuris Montero lined a two-run double to right field, trimming Arizona’s lead to 4-3.</p>\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies’ Ryan McMahon homers again, but seeks consistency\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tProgressive catching guru Jerry Weinstein one of Rockies’ hidden treasures: “He’s a hard (blank), but in the very best way”\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tC.J.

He improved 12-2, though his ERA rose slightly, from 2.42 to 2.50.</p>\n<p>“He has the ability to throw any pitch at any time,” McMahon said. “He’s not afraid to do that and he locates pitches. And he doesn’t make a lot of mistakes over the middle. That’s one of the reasons I swung on the first pitch today. I thought that it would probably be the best pitch I was going to get.”</p>\n<p>McMahon was one of the Rockies’ few bright spots. Starting at second base and hitting leadoff, he went 2-for-4 and launched a two-run homer in the eighth, his third homer of the homestand and 16th of the season.</p>\n<p>In his short stint on the mound, Feltner gave up four runs on four hits and walked four. His ERA rose from 5.85 to 6.12. Feltner allowed one baserunner through the first two innings before giving up three hits and walking four in the third. He threw 40 pitches in the third inning.</p>\n<p>“There were a number of pitches that were non-competitive — just too far out of the strike zone,” Black said. “They were pitches that the hitters never really had to worry about. Once that happens, the hitters gain an advantage a little bit. If a guy is spraying the ball all over, they can zero in. If you aren’t throwing strikes consistently, it’s going to come back to bite you.”</p>\n<p>The Rockies are off Monday before beginning a five-game road trip Tuesday in Chicago.

They’ll enter the trip with a 21-46 road record, which is the worst in the majors.

        "description": "<p>The Pirates will promote pitching prospect Luis Ortiz to the majors, Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports (Twitter link).  It will be a Major League debut for Ortiz, a 23-year-old right-hander who was an international signing in 2018.  The Bucs will need to make some corresponding moves to create space on the active and 40-man rosters.</p>\n<p>Ortiz is rated by Baseball America as Pittsburgh’s 22nd-best prospect, with BA’s scouting report describing Ortiz as “perhaps the most improved pitcher in the Pirates’ system.”  After pitching in A-ball in 2021, Ortiz began the 2022 campaign at Double-A and has a combined 4.56 ERA over 124 1/3 innings at the Double-A and Triple-A levels.  The home run ball has been an issue for Ortiz, but he has solid walk, strikeout, and grounder rates that belie his forgettable ERA.</p>\n<p>His most recent outing was a gem, as Ortiz threw six no-hit innings for Triple-A Indianapolis on September 8.  That would seemingly put Ortiz to make his MLB debut on Tuesday, when the Pirates have a doubleheader against the Reds.  It remains to be seen if the Pirates will properly start Ortiz in one of the two games, or if they could look to ease him into action as part of a bullpen game or as a bulk pitcher.</p>\n<p>The bullpen might eventually end up being Ortiz’s long-term destination, though naturally the Pirates will first see what he can do as a starter before exploring relief assignments.  Ortiz’s upper-90s fastball profiles well as a signature pitch, and he complements that fastball with a quality slider and an improving changeup.</p>",

        "description": "<p>ARLINGTON, Texas — Former President George W. Bush took part in a first ball ceremony in Texas, Aaron Judge put on special cleats at Yankee Stadium and the New York Mets wore first responder caps as Major League Baseball paused Sunday to remember the Sept. 11 attacks.</p> \n<p>There were moments of silence, remembrances and tributes at ballparks all across America on the 21st anniversary of 9/11.</p> \n<p>“It’s a moment in our country’s history. We all have certain things we remember, where we were when it happened and how we felt. So many people involved, so it’s a chance to honor those people today. Realizing the people and families that were affected by this that are still feeling the pain from it,” Mets manager Buck Showalter said before a game in Miami.</p> \n<p>Bush, who was president on the day of the attacks, was at Globe Life Field as the Rangers played Toronto. He joined Jimmy Pollozani, a police officer in nearby Fort Worth, and Pollozani’s 13-year-old daughter, Andita, in the ceremony.</p> \n<p>They represented police officers, firefighters and first responders across the state. Andita threw the pitch to Rocky Wolfe, a firefighter from the central Texas city of Killeen.</p> \n<p>Bush famously delivered a perfect strike before Game 3 of the 2001 World Series at Yankee Stadium between the Yankees and Arizona Diamondbacks weeks after New York City’s twin towers fell.</p> \n<p>There was a moment of silence before the Blue Jays and Rangers played. During the Canadian and U.S. national anthems, Bush stood between Texas interim manager Tony Beasley and first base coach Corey Ragsdale in front of the home dugout.</p> \n<p>Bush delivered the ball to Andita and gave her a hug and a word of advice before she threw from just in front of the mound. Afterward, Bush gave a fist bump to her father before they left the field.</p> \n<p>Bush received rousing applause when he was announced. As he headed toward the Rangers’ dugout afterward, some fans chanted, “USA! USA!”</p> \n<p>All Rangers and Blue Jays personnel in uniform wore a special Patriot Day patch on their caps. Special lineup cards and base jewels were used.</p> \n<p>Bush was part of the investment group that owned the Rangers from April 1989 until June 1998 and remains involved with the club.

        "description": "<p>“You gotta be ready for battle. So put on the full armor of God,” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has been urging crowds of Republicans during speeches this summer. “Take a stand against the left’s schemes. Stand firm with the belt of truth buckled around your waist. You will face fire from flaming arrows, but the shield of faith will protect you.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is he stumping for GOP midterm votes, or raising an army for End Times?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis’s paraphrasing of a passage from Ephesians 6 in the New Testament that replaces “the devil” with the “the left” and readies the conservative faithful for spiritual warfare underscores the growing phenomenon of a party whose most devout members increasingly identify as white Christian nationalists engaged in a culture war, if not a literal one, to save the soul of America. And this is not some fringe view. DeSantis could very well be the GOP’s presidential candidate in 2024, while Doug Mastriano, one of the candidates he stumped for who shares similar, if not more robust views of Christian nationalism, is the GOP’s gubernatorial candidate in Pennsylvania. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this alarming context, The Flag and The Cross: White Christian Nationalism and the Threat to American Democracy by Philip S. Gorski and Samuel L. Perry is a timely and much needed examination of this movement’s origin story, its ideology, and the dangers it poses to U.S. multiracial democracy.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>#PA \"People need to understand the Christian right and start organizing against it, otherwise the state (and country) may be unrecognizable in four years.\" https://t.co/sUiPKRB5iZ</p>— Jenny Stephens (@JennyStephens52) July 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\n<p>So what exactly is white Christian nationalism?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“White Christian nationalism is our term for the ethno-traditionalism among many white Americans that conflates racial, religious, and national identity (the deep story) and pines for cultural and political power that demographic and cultural shifts have increasingly threatened (the vision),” Gorski and Perry write.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The authors note, crucially, that within the context of white Christian nationalism, “Christian” isn’t actually used to identify someone’s personal religiosity and church attendance, but instead serves as a cultural and political identity marker. This separates the “worthy,” yet demographically shrinking “us” who in the eyes of these believers are solely the legitimate occupants and beneficiaries of American democracy, from “them,” which is the Left, and all the others it counts among its members – Blacks, immigrants, secular progressives, and really the entire Democratic Party which it conflates with (godless) socialists or communists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The authors periodize American history to tell the “deep story” of the trajectory of white Christian nationalism through the last three centuries. They bring to light the stories behind the country’s “oft-forgotten little wars,” population shifts, and religious demographic changes that they believe brought the movement to this moment, earmarking the years 1689, 1763, 1889, and 1989. Their survey of history that takes the reader through King Philipp’s War, the French and Indian Wars, the Spanish-American War, and the end of the Cold War helps explain how “understandings of whiteness, divine providence, and national identity” changed in the country during these periods. The authors also use survey data to measure white Christian Nationalism’s reach in contemporary America and to understand how whites who identify as Christian nationalists’ political attitudes, beliefs, and understanding of civics hold views in opposition to most contemporary Americans, even within the Christian community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freedom, patriarchy, whiteness, and “order” is the framework for the world they are trying to build, while violence, both historically from the frontier to the plantation to the lynching trees, and today with what we saw Jan. 6, 2021, is what’s needed to maintain this order. How do white Christian nationalists legitimize violence? First, you frame everything in the country in apocalyptic terms that mimics Biblical Rapture and Armageddon, good versus evil. Then if that’s indeed the case, well what choice is there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The general principle is this: white men must sometimes exercise righteous violence to defend (their) freedom and maintain social (and racial) order. It is freedom for ‘us’ and authoritarian social order for ‘them,’” the authors note.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another striking feature of this movement is its anti-democratic nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul Weyrich, cofounder of the American Legislative Exchange Council and the Moral Majority, said “the quiet part out loud” as the book notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t want everybody to vote. Elections are not won by a majority of people. They never have been from the beginning of our country, and they are not now,” he said. “As a matter of fact, our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>#PA \"People need to understand the Christian right and start organizing against it, otherwise the state (and country) may be unrecognizable in four years.\" https://t.co/sUiPKRB5iZ</p>— Jenny Stephens (@JennyStephens52) July 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\n<p>Our multiracial democracy is quite young – it actually only began in 1965 with the passage of the Voting Rights Act. And the voter suppression Republicans have been championing of late is part of a decades-long backlash to this development. In fact, lawmakers in 39 states have considered almost 400 bills for the 2022 legis­lat­ive session that would make it more difficult to vote, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, and as of 2021, 18 states have passed 34 of these types of  voting laws that dispro­por­tion­ately affect voters of color. This would usher in a “Jim Crow 2.0” which would herald a MAGA restoration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the eyes of today’s white Christian nationalists, the country is a Christian nation under attack by mongrel forces of evil, and multiracial inclusive democracy is the sickness, not the cure. Christians are both heroes and victims of this story – in their minds at least: the ones fighting on the side of God and righteousness and who at the same time are the people most discriminated against and persecuted precisely because of that. Their civilizing mission prioritizes seizing power, above all, in order to do God’s work. And their God isn’t too concerned with democracy, nor is He averse to violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The authors state that we need to “build a popular front in defense of American democracy, an alliance that extends from #NeverTrump Republicans to Democratic Socialists, an alliance that includes religious conservatives, as well as secular progressives.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we want multiracial democracy in the U.S. – as imperfect as it is – to survive, if not limp into its sixth decade, organizing against white Christian nationalism must be a daily priority. But first, we have to understand exactly what it is we’re up against, and this book is a good place to start.</p>",

He then issued a one-out walk to Eugenio Suarez, but struck out Cal Raleigh and got Carlos Santana to ground out to escape with no further damage. </p>\n<p>Adam Frazier led off the second with a single, but Odorizzi retired the next three hitters in order to leave him stranded. Rodriguez led off the third with another single, but was gunned down trying to steal second by William Contreras. Odorizzi struck out Mitch Hanigar and then got Suarez to fly out to end the inning. </p>\n<p>Marco Gonzales has the Braves number early. He came into the game with a strikeout percentage of just 12.6%, but recorded four strikeouts over three scoreless innings to start. Gonzales retired the first two hitters in the fourth, but Austin Riley followed with his 36th home run of the season to tie the game. </p>\n\n\n<p>All tied up courtesy of @austinriley1308!#ForTheA pic.twitter.com/jh5hD2tDBu</p>— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Odorizzi walked the tightrope over the first three innings, but issued back-to-back walks to Raleigh and Santana to start the fourth. Frazier made him pay with a triple off the center field wall to put the Mariners back in front 3-1. Odorizzi got Jesse Winker and J.P. Crawford to pop out for the first two outs, but then allowed a single to center on a 2-2 pitch to Sam Haggerty that scored Frazier to make it 4-1. Odorizzi was replaced by Collin McHugh who struck out Rodriguez to end the inning. </p>\n<p>It was a rough outing for Odorizzi who allowed the leadoff man to reach in all four innings. He allowed five hits, three walks and four runs in just 3 2/3 innings. He struck out three while throwing 71 pitches. </p>\n<p>McHugh stayed in for the fifth and surrendered a solo home run to Suarez to extend the deficit to 5-1. Tyler Matzek took over in the sixth and surrendered two walks and a run-scoring double to Crawford that made it 6-1. </p>\n<p>While the pitching struggled, Atlanta’s offense sputtered again. Gonzales allowed just two hits and didn’t walk a batter to go along with five strikeouts in six innings. Matt Brash struck out the side in the seventh. </p>\n<p>The Braves drew closer in the eight as Michael Harris led off the inning with his 17th home run of the season to cut the deficit to 6-2. Marcell Ozuna then worked a walk before Robbie Grossman flew out. However, Andres Munoz replaced Erik Swanson and retired Ronald Acuña Jr. and Dansby Swanson to bring the inning to an end. </p>\n<p>Atlanta’s comeback began in the ninth against Diego Castillo as Riley and Matt Olson worked back-to-back walks to start the inning. Both runners moved up on a grounder to first by Contreras. Vaughn Grissom struck out for the second out before Harris launched a three-run shot to right to cut the Seattle lead to 6-5. </p>\n\n\n<p>.@MoneyyyMikeee's second home run of the day was a NO DOUBTER  #ForTheA pic.twitter.com/SC1wmtRoZt</p>— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Castillo was replaced by Paul Sewald and Brian Snitker countered by sending up Eddie Rosario to pinch hit for Marcell Ozuna. Rosario lined a 1-2 pitch from Sewald into right field for a single. Robbie Grossman followed with two-run shot to right to put Atlanta in front 7-6. </p>\n\n\n<p>We were down 4 runs with 2 outs in the 9th. Update: pic.twitter.com/71QuuzsiP7</p>— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Sewald then drilled Acuña with a 93 mph fastball who went to first and then stole his 27th base of the season. He escaped any more damage as Swanson grounded out to end the inning. </p>\n<p>The lead wouldn’t last for long though as Kenley Jansen took over in the ninth. He retired Sam Haggerty on a bunt attempt for the first out, but Rodriguez struck again as he hammered a 1-1 pitch and drove it out to tie the game at 7-7. Jansen got pinch hitter Ty France to pop out for the second out, but then gave up a walk-off homer to Suarez to end the game. </p>\n<p>Atlanta falls to 87-53 on the season and are now 1.5 games behind the Mets in the NL East standings.

        "description": "Joe Rondone / USA TODAY NETWORK\n    \n\n  <p>Gallen’s streak stopped, but record broken</p> Record: 66-73. Pace: 77-85. Change on 2021: +21.\n<p>Vacation is over, but that doesn’t mean I can’t still have a little fun.   For this time I’m up north in the pines crushing a pint with my badass father-in-law at Dark Sky Brewing Co.</p>\n<p>Let’s go!!!!</p>\n<p>Inning 1:</p>\n<p>Achievement unlocked! Gallen beats out Webb for most consecutive scoreless innings for a Dback and is still tracking for the overall record.  Holy shit he’s amazing.</p>\n<p>Knew he was destined for it, even in the pitcher unfriendly confines of Coors.</p>\n<p>Inning 2:</p>\n<p>Meh.  Another meh inning from the bats, but this game is mostly about Gallen anyhow and far from over.</p>\n<p>On that note Gallen keeps that streak going with a commanding 1-2-3 inning here in the 2nd, looking very much like someone we’d like to sign long term very soon indeed.</p>\n<p>Inning 3:</p>\n<p>Rojas sacrifices in the first Snek run of the afternoon with many many many more to come.</p>\n<p>Soon after Stone Garrett drivers in another run and then in a wild little string of events CWalk steals home after he seemingly got caught in no-mans-land after a wild pitch.  I’m still processing that one.....</p>\n<p>So thus we exit the 3rd up 4-0 over the Rockies and Gallen once more crushes any hope for their bats with yet another 1-2-3 drubbing.</p>\n<p> Inning 4:</p>\n<p>No further fireworks for us in the 4th, and sadly Gallen’s string of perfection ends here in the 4th as well.  Even a god can be humbled and the 3runs the Rockies tacked on Gallen’s outing certainly took some of the steam out of his sales, but we still hold a 4-3 lead going in to the 5th.</p>\n<p>Inning 5:</p>\n<p>No relief for Gallen to be had in the 5th, but Zac laughs at the Rockies in the 5th and shipped them off to Greenland:  1-2-3.</p>\n<p>Just like that the slug fest I thought was certain is now a pitchers duel fought at a rapid pace.</p>\n<p>Inning 6:</p>\n<p>Rojas starts things off for the Sneks with a 1out single, followed by McCarthy one out later driving him home just barely sneaking a single through to left field:  5-3 Dbacks.</p>\n<p>Gallen gives a chefs kiss to this outing with yet another 1-2-3 inning, which would end up being the end of his day and end of quite a spectacular streak of starts.  He still did great tonight, especially when one considers how much of a murderers rows Coors can be for even the best of pitchers.</p>\n<p>We salute you Zac!</p>\n<p>Inning 7:</p>\n<p>Stone Garrett sets the table to start the 7th with a walk, followed by a Rivera single, followed  by a double steal, followed by a Carson Kelly walk, followed by a KMarte double, followed by a Rojas single and finally followed by a McCarthy single.  All these lovely little events leads to a satisfying 5runs and a comfortable 10-3 lead going in to the bottom of the frame. </p>\n<p> Sometimes it’s really nice to play in Coors.</p>\n<p>Ginkel replaces the august Gallen, but despite being of our oft maligned bullpen he keeps this game very far from the Rockies grasp and we’re off to the 8th very much in charge.</p>\n<p> Inning 8:</p>\n<p>But then there was Ian Kennedy.....</p>\n<p>Why is he pitching at all anymore?  WHY?</p>\n<p>Hits his first batter he faces and then serves up a juicy meatball to McMahon to make it a 10-5 game.  That followed by a single and a walk ends Kennedy elevendieth crap outing and forces one of our few decent bullpen arms to save things.  Luckily Mantiply is up to the challenge only gives up one of his inherited runners as we exit in to the 9th.</p>\n<p>Inning 9:</p>\n<p>A Varsho walk, McCarthy triple and CWalk single act as the icing on the cake of this game; tacking on 2 more runs and all but putting this game out of reach (even against our crap pen).</p>\n<p>That point is proven quite true as the Rockies go down in order in the bottom of the 9th and I can now attend to my in-laws who are in town.  </p>\n<p>Happy Sunday All!!!!</p>\nBells and whistles, by Jim\n  \n        \n  \n\n<p>Click for details at Fangraphs.com\nKrusty: Stone Garrett, +20.5%\nPennywise: Zac Gallen, +12.6%\nJohn Wayne Gacy: Carson Kelly, -12.7%\nRonald McDonald: Ian Kennedy, -8.1%</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, nothing like scoring 23 runs over a three-game series, and still dropping two of the games... Oh, well. The Gameday Thread was rudely interrupted by a service outage, so despite the record-setting performance by Gallen, we ended up falling just short of 150 comments. As I mentioned, I think Christian Walker stealing home broke the Internet. There were still a few Sedona Red comments, covering the above, Ian Kennedy’s usage and our bullpen in general. But it would be churlish not to choose one that commemorated Gallen’s remarkable achievement, so we give it to samath:</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>Back to Chase Field go the D-backs to start a streak of a dozen games against the Padres or Dodgers, with San Diego the first in. Not sure I can hold my nose for that long... :) Things get under way at Chase tomorrow night at 6:40 pm, with Ryne Nelson looking to follow up on his amazing MLB debut. </p>",

        "description": "<p>The South Siders fall hard, and we’re not saying Tony is to blame — but he might be to blame</p> <p>The White Sox looked to finish their seven-game road trip 6-1 on a gloomy afternoon in Chicago. Prior to the start of the game, Dave Stewart had his number retired, and it was revealed that Tony La Russa had a medical procedure done. </p>\n\n\n<p>White Sox manager Tony La Russa confirms to me he had a pacemaker inserted for his heart. He is grateful for having undergone a relatively \"simple\" procedure and is coming along well, working to regain his strength. It's unclear when he'll be ready to manage again.</p>— Janie McCauley (@JanieMcCAP) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Tony was cleared to attend the number retirement ceremony, but left the dugout prior to the start of the game. The lineup was in Miguel Cairo’s hands this afternoon, and he lined them up in what he hoped to be sweep formation. Josh Harrison was a late scratch (flu), and was replaced by Leury García.</p>\n\n\n<p>Today's #WhiteSox starters in Oakland.⏰: 3:07 p.m. CT : @NBCSChicago  : @ESPN1000  : @FDSportsbook  : CWS to have most hits -200 pic.twitter.com/6sDzWayG6R</p>— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Bears fans were hoping for a two-for-one day, after the Bears completed a 19-10 victory against San Francisco back in Chicago.</p>\n\n\n<p>A Bears dub followed by a White Sox 4 game sweep.

Andrew Vaughn looked real speedy going first to home.</p>\n\n\n<p>WHEELS pic.twitter.com/18DeZ8gATg</p>— Father Zo (@SouthsideZo) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Tony Kemp got on base after he was allegedly hit by a Johnny Cueto pitch. Kemp then scored on a bloop single to Adam Engel, making it 1-1.</p>\n\n\n<p>Outfield defense is important huh.</p>— BeefLoaf   (@MrDelicious13) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Oakland challenged a foul ball call in the bottom of the first inning and lost. Things between innings got a little tense, and I, for one, was much more entertained than I was yesterday.</p>\n\n\n<p>The A's went off on the umps before the start of the second inning after a ball down the left-field line was called foul in the first (call stayed the same after a replay review). Resulted in the ejection of Chad Pinder, who hit that ball.</p>— Vinnie Duber (@VinnieDuber) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The White Sox would retake the lead in the top of the fourth inning on an AJ Pollock sacrifice fly. Abreu scored the run after a HBP, and getting to third on a LONG single by Eloy.</p>\n\n\n<p>Eloy smashes one off the wall and ends up on first lol run ffs</p>— Liddle Tina (@liddle_ktina) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>White Sox have seized the lead at 2-1 on AJ Pollock's sac fly.Meanwhile, the Guardians sweep the Twins.</p>— Daryl Van Schouwen (@CST_soxvan) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>If you read the last portion of the tweet above, you will discover that the Twins decided not to help the White Sox out today.</p>\n\n\n<p>Twins worthless</p>— SoxNerd (@SoxNerd) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Defensive miscues in the bottom of the fourth? Ah yes, I know just who is at fault.</p>\n\n\n<p>I blame Tony being at the ballpark because yes, that seems like the right place to point fingers.</p>— The Last AirBENder (@BenChiTownKid98) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>A one-run game in the top of the fifth? The only logical explanation is a bunt. I am not sure why Chrystal is asking such strange questions in all-caps.</p>\n\n\n<p>WHY ARE WE BUNTING?!</p>— Chrystal O’Keefe (@chrystal_ok) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you read that last bit with dripping sarcasm because that is exactly how I typed it. The White Sox relinquished the lead in the bottom of the fifth inning. I can’t confirm the below theory, but I am not going to deny it.</p>\n\n\n<p>I think there’s a correlation with TLR being in the building and the Sox losing. It’s like a black magic Jerry curse.</p>— Brian Knights (@BrianKnights3) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Leury drops a ball in foul territory that would have been the final out. Instead, it opens the door for a home run. Oakland put up a six-spot in the bottom of the fifth to make it 7-2, and we are straight-up not having a good time.</p>\n\n\n<p>Leury Garcia REEKS MAN.</p>— Sell The White Sox (@HashTagWhiteSox) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>pic.twitter.com/7iZ9UzBfBC</p>— italian mortician addams   (@marjraguso) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The White Sox scratched one run across to make it 7-3 in the top of the sixth.

Chip away. #WhiteSox #ChangeTheGame</p>— Amanda K (@den_manders_01) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Just when I thought maybe we could get some momentum going, Kemp hit a solo shot to make it 8-3.</p>\n\n\n<p>When Tony Kemp plays the White Sox. pic.twitter.com/Tr3WndAl9B</p>— Brandon (@TheRealBDejesus) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>It really just was not the White Sox’s day, and for the sake of superstition, I really hope Tony was being serious.</p>\n\n\n<p>So we’re all in agreement. pic.twitter.com/FLTsjisucD</p>— Brian (@Go_GoSox) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The Athletics added insult to injury in the bottom of the eighth, making it 10-3.</p>\n\n\n<p>game off</p>— italian mortician addams   (@marjraguso) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The White Sox did not have a magic ninth inning in them on this Sunday, and dropped the final game of their road trip, 10-3. </p>\n\n\n<p>Since 8/30 (the first game Miguel Cairo managed after Tony La Russa had to see doctors):White Sox in games where Tony La Russa was at the stadium: 0-2White Sox in games where Tony La Russa was NOT at the stadium: 9-2</p>— Bennett Karoll (@TheBennettK) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The White Sox will have Monday off before facing the Rockies at home on Tuesday. They end a 5-2 West Coast road trip by losing a half-game on the Guardians over the course of the last week, and sit 2 1⁄2 games out of first place. </p>\n<p></p>",

First Balakliya, then Kupyansk, then Izium, a city that sits on major supply routes. These names won’t mean much to a foreign audience, but they are places that have been beyond reach, impossible for Ukrainians to contact for months.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Now they have fallen in hours. As I write this, Ukrainian forces are said to be fighting on the outskirts of Donetsk, a city that Russia has occupied since 2014.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Many things about this advance are unexpected, especially the location: For many weeks, the Ukrainians loudly telegraphed their intention to launch a major offensive farther south. The biggest shock is not Ukraine’s tactics but Russia’s response… Russian troops are not fighting back.”</p>",

Julie Youssef, 25, lives in Melbourne and is of Egyptian descent. She says the Queen symbolises the pillaging of her cultural heritage. “Everything the Queen represents, irrespective of the personal attributes she held in terms of being a nice old lady, is the legacy of violence and colonialism across the globe that has touched the majority of people in some way or the other,” Youssef says. She points to the Egyptian artefacts that were stolen by the British government and still held as a key example of continuous colonialism under the Queen’s reign.</p><p>She says Australia is still grappling with its colonial past and the inequality it created between settlers and First Nations people.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p>Pennsylvania Democrat Lt. Gov. John Fetterman doubled down on his pro-choice position at a rally Sunday as he vies against Republican nominee Mehmet Oz in the state’s U.S. Senate race. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Women are the reason we can win. Let me say that again: Women are the reason we win.” Fetterman told the crowd in Blue Bell, Penn., standing in front of a pink-and-black “Women For Fetterman” sign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Don’t piss women off,” Fetterman added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He introduced himself at the start of his speech as “John Fetterwoman.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fetterman said his first actions in Congress, if elected, would be to do away with the filibuster and then to codify the right to abortion in federal law. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This decision: should [it] be made up to Dr. Oz? Or to a woman and a real doctor, to choose?” Fetterman asked the audience, mocking his celebrity opponent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fetterman’s push for the female vote in Pennsylvania comes amid reports of a surge in women registering to vote after Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court. A number of Republican candidates in battleground states have sought to soften their abortion stances ahead of November. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Oz believes abortion is murder… No exceptions: rape or incest... If every abortion is a murder, that means Dr. Oz considers every woman who had to choose abortion is a killer,” Fetterman said, referring to audio of Oz critiquing abortion procedures. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Republican's camp has said he does support exceptions to abortion bans in cases of rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fetterman has been polling ahead of his Republican opponent, but Oz has been ramping up his campaign as the election approaches. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pair have spent months largely locked in social media spats. Fetterman announced last week that he plans to debate his opponent after Oz and retiring Sen. Pat Toomey (R), whose seat the two candidates are trying to fill, criticized him for not engaging in in-person debate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fetterman on Sunday also mocked Toomey for being a \"miracle\" of politics, due to being \"despised\" by both Democrats and Republicans. </p>",

Pat Toomey (R), whose seat Fetterman is trying to fill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Senator Toomey was not very nice to me,” Fetterman told the crowd in Blue Bell, Penn., according to videos shared online, referring to the senator's criticism about Fetterman's fitness to serve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Pat Toomey is a miracle,\" Fetterman quipped. \"He managed to be — figured out how to be despised by Republicans and Democrats.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toomey, the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, has drawn ire from both parties over the past two years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former President Trump lambasted the Pennsylvania senator after he was one of seven upper chamber Republicans who voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial. And Toomey drew criticism from Democrats this summer for his efforts to block a bill to aid military veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toomey last week joined Oz at a news conference, during which he called Fetterman’s fitness into question and knocked him for not debating sooner. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fetterman suffered a stroke earlier this year and has been vocal about his health challenges, including some hearing and speech issues that he says have kept him from debating his Republican opponent Mehmet Oz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He said he's feeling better than he's felt in a very long time. He said the only lingering effect of stroke is, and I quote, ‘every now and then I'm gonna miss a word or mush two together,’ end quote,\" Toomey said at the conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Well, if that's all true, then why won't you agree to debate Dr. Oz? It's clear that he's being dishonest.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toomey also mocked Fetterman's aggressive and often irreverent online campaigning as he recovered from the stroke. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You can't do the job of US Senator sitting at home firing off snarky tweets,” Toomey said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toomey announced in 2020 that he would retire to the private sector at the end of his second Senate term, citing personal reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fetterman on Sunday said Toomey had a chance to match up against him, \"and he quit.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lieutenant governor announced last week that he plans to debate Oz, who appears to be ramping up his campaign efforts as he continues to trail in polls. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former President Trump earlier this month rallied in Pennsylvania for Oz and gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano.</p>",

        "description": "<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on Saturday said it would deactivate a West Texas border patrol account that retweeted far-right posts from Stephen Miller, who was a key architect of former President Trump's immigration policy as a senior White House adviser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus said the retweeted content was removed and the Office of Professional Responsibility was investigating the situation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Totally unacceptable and disappointing that any CBP Twitter account was used to R/T offensive, unauthorized content,\" Magnus tweeted. \"This must not happen again.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CBP Twitter account retweeted two posts from Miller over the weekend, according to screenshots shared on Twitter, including one in which Miller ranted against perceived criminals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Violent criminals lay waste to our communities undisturbed while the immense power of the state is arrayed against those whose only crime is dissent,\" Miller wrote. \"The law has been turned from a shield to protect the innocent into a sword to conquer them.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another post retweeted by CBP West Texas, Miller took aim at the media, saying its \"greatest power is its ability to frame what is a dire national crisis (eg \"cops are racist\" summer '20) and what is not.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Biden's eradication of our border means we are no longer a Republic - he's ended nearly 250 years of constitutional government. The media is silent,\" Miller tweeted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The immigration policies Miller helped shape under Trump were criticized as being blatantly racist and based on fear-mongering. He reportedly helped craft Trump's travel ban, which targeted Muslim countries; the 450-mile long steel bollard wall on the Mexican border; and the family separation policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A separate statement from CBP, shared by Magnus on Saturday, said the retweets of the CBP West Texas account do not reflect the agency's views on immigration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The tweets do not reflect the values of this administration and our work to rebuild a humane, orderly, and secure immigration system,\" the statement reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) subpoenaed Miller last week in connection to its investigation into Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p>",

        "description": "Jonathan Sierra | Chloe Trofatter / USA TODAY NETWORK\n    \n\n  <p>The South Bend Cubs and Myrtle Beach Pelicans finish their regular season before the playoffs. The Smokies and I-Cubs both lis</p> <p>It’s the last day of the regular season for the Pelicans and South Bend Cubs. Both teams made the playoffs, however, and will start their postseason series on Tuesday. </p>\n<p>Iowa Cubs</p>\n<p>The Iowa Cubs were sauced by the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp (Marlins) 11-9.  The Jumbo Shrimp won the final four game of the series and won the matchup four games to two.</p>\n<p>Adbert Alzolay made a rehab start in this game and allowed one run (on a solo home run) on two hits over 2.2 innings. Alzolay struck out four and walked two. He threw 47 pitches, 29  for strikes.</p>\n<p>Iowa’s bullpen, however, was a bit of a disaster. After Iowa scored five runs in the top of the eighth, Ben Leeper gave up six runs in the bottom of the inning and got the loss. Leeper’s final line was six runs on four hits and two walks over two-thirds of an inning. He did not strike anyone out.</p>\n<p>First baseman Matt Mervis hit a solo home run in the top of the first inning, his 32nd overall and his 11th with the I-Cubs. He’s hit five in this 12-game road tripl. Mervis went 1 for 3 and was intentionally walked once. He scored two times.</p>\n<p>Catcher Tyler Payne hit a three-run home run in the top of the seventh to tie the game up 4-4 at the time. It was Payne’s first home run all year. Payne went 2 for 4 with four total runs batted in.</p>\n<p>Center fielder Darius Hill went 3 for 5 and scored one run. It was Hill’s sixth three-hit game with Iowa this year. He also has had one four-hit game. </p>\n<p>Tennessee Smokies</p>\n<p>The Tennessee Smokies could not reel in the Pensacola Blue Wahoo (Marlins), 7-5 in ten innings. The Blue Wahoos won the six-game series four games to two. </p>\n<p>The Smokies activated DJ Herz for this game and he was better than he was before. Herz allowed three runs (two earned) on just two hits over five innings. Herz struck out seven and walked three. He also hit one batter. Not great, but better. </p>\n<p>Zac Leigh blew a save in the top of the ninth when he gave up two doubles to lead off the inning. Leigh allowed one run on two hits over one inning. He struck out one and walked no one.</p>\n<p>Samuel Reyes pitched the top of the tenth, gave up three runs and took the loss. Reyes’ line was three runs, two earned, on three hits over one inning. Reyes struck out two and intentionally walked one.</p>\n<p>Left fielder Cole Roederer hit a two-run home run in the bottom of the second inning. It was his seventh home run this year and sixth in Double-A. Roederer was 1 for 3 with a walk.</p>\n<p>Delvin Zinn didn’t start this game, but he went into shortstop after Andy Weber was hit by a pitch. Zinn then went 2 for 4 and scored a run. </p>\n<p>Nelson Maldonado, who hasn’t started since getting hit by a pitch on Friday, came off the bench and delivered an RBI single in the bottom of the tenth as a pinch hitter.</p>\n<p>Roederer’s home run:</p>\n\n\n<p>A 2 out HR from Cole Roederer puts the Smokies on top! It's 2-1 Smokies in the bottom of the 2nd. pic.twitter.com/sQDLawrAkt</p>— Tennessee Smokies (@smokiesbaseball) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>South Bend Cubs</p>\n<p>The South Bend Cubs detasseled the Cedar Rapids Kernels (Twins), 9-2. Cedar Rapids won the series three games to two, with one game being cancelled.</p>\n<p>Kohl Franklin started this game and surrendered two runs on four hits over 3.2 innings. Franklin walked four and struck out two. He also hit one batter.</p>\n<p>Franklin gave up a game-tying two-out, two-run double in the bottom of the fourth inning, after which he exited for Adam Lakey. Laskey ended the inning with a ground out to the shortstop and got the win when South Bend struck back with four runs in the top of the fourth. That was the only batter Laskey faced.</p>\n<p>Richard Gallardo took over for Laskey in the fifth and pitched the next four innings without allowing a run. He gave up two hits, walked two and struck out three. Gallardo just got a “hold” for his efforts.</p>\n<p>Right fielder Jonathan Sierra gave South Bend an early lead with a two-run home run in the third inning, his third on the season. Sierra was 3 for 4 and scored two runs.</p>\n<p>Left fielder Jordan Nwogu cranked a two-run home run in the fifth. It was Nwogu’s 15th home run this year. He went 2 for 4.</p>\n<p>First baseman B.J. Murray Jr. was 3 for 4 with a double, a walk and two runs scored.</p>\n<p>DH Caleb Knight was 2 for 4 and scored once.</p>\n<p>Center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong had a two-run single in the fifth and an RBI groundout in the seventh for three total RBI. He was 1 for 5 and scored on Nwogu’s home run.</p>\n<p>South Bend finished the second half with a record of 39-26, five and a half games ahead of second-place Wisconsin. Overall, they finished with a 73-58 record.</p>\n<p>The win today had symbolic importance, as both South Bend and Cedar Rapids finished with the exact same overall record on the year. The two teams will face off in best-of-three series starting in South Bend on Tuesday. After an travel day on Wednesday, game four and, if necessary, game five will be held in Cedar Rapids. </p>\n<p>Myrtle Beach Pelicans</p>\n<p>The Myrtle Beach Pelicans lost to the Carolina Mudcats (Brewers), 9-3. The Pelicans won the series, three wins to two with one cancelled game.</p>\n<p>The Pelicans were in a hole early after starter Oliver Roque gave up five runs on five hits over 2.1 innings. Roque walked two and struck out two in his first start for the right-hander with the Pelicans.</p>\n<p>Catcher Moises Ballesteros went 2 for 3 with a sacrifice fly.</p>\n<p>Center fielder Kevin Alcantara was 1 for 2 with a walk and an RBI single in the bottom of the first inning. It was Alcantara’s first game since leaving with an injury on Thursday. He played five innings tonight.</p>\n<p>The Pelicans finished the second-half with a record of 31-34, which put them in fifth place in their division (out of six), ten-and-a-half games behind first place Charleston. However, the Pelicans won the first half, so they will take on the RiverDogs in a best-of-three series starting in Myrtle Beach on Tuesday. </p>\n<p>Overall for the year, the Pelicans finished with a 78-53 record. </p>",

        "description": "Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Atlanta has lost two straight and has slipped to 1.5 games behind the Mets in the NL East standings. </p> <p>After a soul-crushing walk-off loss Sunday, the Atlanta Braves will have to pick up the pieces quickly when they begin a three-game series Monday against the San Francisco Giants. Atlanta rallied from a 6-2 deficit in the ninth Sunday to take a 7-6 lead only to watch Kenley Jansen allow a pair of solo home runs in the home half of the ninth to send them to an 8-7 loss. Atlanta has dropped two straight since taking over sole possession of first place in the NL East and will enter Monday 1.5 games behind the New York Mets. </p>\n<p>The Braves have to be at least mildly concerned about Jansen, who has now blown three of his past seven save opportunities. Jansen said that he was trying to correct a flaw in his windup after blowing a save against Miami on the last homestand, but came back and picked up a pair of saves Tuesday in Oakland and then again Friday in Seattle. However, he again couldn’t hold the lead again Sunday and allowed a homer for just the second time in his last 14 games. Atlanta has Raisel Iglesias who has plenty of closing experience with the Reds and the Angels, and A.J. Minter, who has put together a more-than-solid 2022 campaign as available options. At the least, a match-up based approach could be in order while Jansen finds his form, even if it seems like a bridge too far to just stop managing relievers in a “traditional” way altogether.</p>\n<p>Though the Braves held their own against the Mariners, but for some spotty pitching usage and getting locked down by George Kirby and the Mariners’ best relief arms, the Giants don’t pose as much of a threat on paper. Expected to compete for a playoff spot after amassing an MLB-best 107 wins last year, the Giants looked like contenders for five weeks before starting to tread water in mid-May, and then completely collapsing in July and August. The Braves helped usher in their collapse by taking three of four in Atlanta, including two walk-off wins. The Giants left Atlanta 38-31 and didn’t win another series until weeks later, at which point they were just 45-42. They fell back to .500 on July 25 and haven’t been meaningfully above that mark since. Their playoff odds dwindled from over 50 percent on July 19 to three percent on August 5, a stretch that included the tail-end of a seven-game slide and then a separate four-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>The Giants are 5-5 in September so far with a Sunday night game still to play, which has included a four-game winning streak and a five-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>What’s really killed them has been their defense: they’re pretty much the worst defensive unit in MLB, which combines with average hitting to give them a below-average position player corps. The pitching’s been a top-ten squad, mostly due to a top-five rotation, but the bullpen’s been bad — and any struggles have been magnified by their inability to turn balls in play into outs. Their mix-and-match style of play means they don’t have any position players above 2.2 fWAR, though they do have eight players over 1.0, and another 11 between 0.0 and 1.0. On the pitching end, the trio of Carlos Rodon, Logan Webb, and Alex Cobb have been very good, and Camilo Doval has provided great relief, but there isn’t much else to speak of behind that, especially in the bullpen.</p>\nMonday, September 12, 9:45 p.m. ET (Bally Sports South)\n<p>Spencer Strider (29 G, 18 GS, 120.2 IP, 38.1 K%, 8.5 BB%, 2.69 ERA, 1.83 FIP)</p>\n<p>Rookie right-hander Spencer Strider will get the start for Atlanta in Monday’s series opener. Strider allowed two first inning runs in his last start in Oakland but then settled in nicely and was able to log six innings to go along with nine strikeouts. Those nine strikeouts brought his season total to 183 in just 120 2/3 innings. He is vying to become just the fourth Braves pitcher (Charlie Morton 2021, Mike Foltynewicz 2018, Javier Vasquez 2009) since 2009 to have 200 strikeouts in a season. It will be interesting to see how this game goes, because one of Strider’s few struggle bug starts came against the Giants at home — he showed diminished velocity and got victimized by both a patient approach and some unexpected longballs. </p>\n<p>Alex Cobb (23 GS, 122.1 IP, 24.4 K%, 7.2 BB%, 3.68 ERA, 3.00 FIP)</p>\n<p>Right-hander Alex Cobb will start opposite of Strider in the opener. Cobb has put together a solid season despite a couple of trips to the Injured List. He allowed seven hits, three walks and three runs in just 4 1/3 innings in his last start against the Dodgers. That snapped a two-start, 12 inning stretch where he had not yielded a run. Cobb has been victimized by a low strand rate (there’s that bad defense again) this year, and could be a tough matchup.</p>\nTuesday, September 13, 9:45 p.m. ET (Bally Sports South)\n<p>Kyle Wright (26 GS, 158.2 IP, 23.8 K%, 7.1 BB%, 3.23 ERA, 3.69 FIP)</p>\n<p>Kyle Wright will get the call on Tuesday and will be looking to bounce back from his worst start of the season. Wright was unable to get comfortable from the start, perhaps due to grip issues, and allowed five hits, three walks and a season-high eight runs in just four innings last time out against Oakland. That was the first time in four starts that he had allowed as many as two runs in an outing. He hadn’t issued three walks in a start since walking three back on June 29 in Philadelphia. </p>\n<p>Jakob Junis (19 G, 15 GS, 92.2 IP, 20.9 K%, 5.2 BB%, 3.98 ERA, 3.82 FIP)</p>\n<p>Righty Jakob Junis will get the start in Tuesday’s matchup. Junis allowed three hits and two runs over six innings in his last start in Milwaukee. That snapped a two-start stretch where he had failed to make it out of the fifth inning. Tuesday will be Junis’ first career appearance against Atlanta. Junis has pitched okay on the year all-in-all, but isn’t anywhere near as imposing as Carlos Rodon, who will follow him, or even Alex Cobb.</p>\nWednesday, September 14, 3:45 p.m. ET ( Bally Sports South)\n<p>Charlie Morton (27 GS, 152.1 IP, 28.3 K%, 8.5 BB%, 4.08 ERA, 4.16 FIP)</p>\n<p>Charlie Morton will get the start for the Braves in Wednesday’s series finale. Morton’s wild ride of a season continued Friday in Seattle where he allowed six hits, three of which were homers, and four runs in 6 1/3 innings. Since the start of August, Morton has allowed 0, 5, 0, 2, 4, 1 and 4 runs in his last seven starts. The home run ball has been an issue of late as he has allowed six in his last three starts combined. Morton faced the Giants back on June 22 and allowed three hits, two runs and struck out 11 in seven innings. </p>\n<p>Carlos Rodon (28 GS, 162.2 IP, 32.5 K%, 7.4 BB%, 2.93 ERA, 2.33 FIP)</p>\n<p>Carlos Rodon will make his 29th start of the season for the Giants in the finale. Rodon has turned in an exceptional season for San Francisco and is on the shortlist for Cy Young Award candidates, and currently leads all of baseball in pitching fWAR. He allowed three hits, two runs and struck out 11 in 5 1/3 innings in his last start against the Cubs. He has posted at least 10 strikeouts in four of his last five outings. He matched up against Morton in Atlanta back on June 22 and allowed three hits, one run and struck out 10 in seven innings of work. </p>",

        "description": "Whoopsie. | D. Ross Cameron-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>The South Siders suffer their 69th loss, and it wasn’t nice at all</p> <p>Oof.</p>\n<p>For lack of a better term, the Chicago White Sox got their butts kicked by the Oakland Athletics today, dropping the series finale by a lopsided score of 10-3. The 90-loss A’s jumped up and down on the Sox all afternoon, finding every gap in the Collesium with their 14 hits. With this loss, the Sox fall to 72-69 on the season, snapping a four-game winning streak and losing ground to the first-place Cleveland Guardians, who now lead the AL Central by 2 1⁄2 games.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t the best way to end what had been an otherwise very successful road trip.</p>\n<p>Manager Tony La Russa, sidelined by health issues that included pacemaker surgery, was in the ballpark today to attend the number retirement ceremony of Dave Stewart. Now, I’ve taken a few statistics courses in my time on Earth, and I know better than to imply that correlation equals causation. I know that La Russa’s presence didn’t cause the White Sox to wet the bed against the A’s today. I know that. But come on, it’s a little funny to think about, and the jokes are just laid up so perfectly. La Russa pokes his head into the dugout for 10 minutes, and then this happens? It reminded me of that scene from The Office when Stanley is wearing a stress monitor, and every time Michael comes near him, the alarm goes off. In seriousness, I wish La Russa the very best — and I hope he can fully recover from his California home.</p>\n<p>Of course, the White Sox loss didn’t have a single thing to do with La Russa’s presence. Starting pitcher Johnny Cueto was nowhere near his best today. His velocity was down, and he was clearly bothered by his rocky performance. Lasting only 4 ⅔ innings, it was the shortest outing that Cueto has had all season. It was clear from the beginning of the game that Cueto wasn’t at his best, but things really went sideways in the fifth inning. That’s when the walls came tumbling down.</p>\n<p>It started with back-to-back singles. It was followed by another single — and then two doubles. And none of them were cheap. The A’s were seeing Cueto very well and making great, solid contact. It certainly didn’t help when Leury García had a foul ball — which should have been the third out — pop in and out of his glove. After that, Ramón Laureano made it hurt with a three-run home run over the left-field fence.</p>\n<p>When it was all said and done, the A’s batted all the way around (and then some), and Cueto was left holding the bag, allowing six runs to score in the fifth inning. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>It was rough stuff, friends. Cueto’s record falls to 7-8, and his ERA nudged up from 2.87 to 3.09.</p>\n<p>Oakland’s starting pitcher Cole Irvin did a great job today of keeping the White Sox hitters at bay, allowing only four hits and striking out five during his seven innings of work. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>And that was it. Not too much to write home about, Sox fans. The team will travel home and enjoy an off-day tomorrow before starting a two-game series against the Colorado Rockies, followed by a season-defining week in which they will play four games against the Guardians. (Cue scary music.)</p>\n\n<p>Today’s scorecard highlights:</p>\nThis was my working title for today’s recap after a few strange review calls and that dumpster fire of a fifth inning.\n  \n        \n      Weird calls and hard-hit balls.\n  \nAdam Engel did not have a good day. Like, at all.\n  \n        \n      …on a bunt attempt?!\n  \nSox lose. \n  \n        \n      (Fart noises.)\n  \n<p></p>",

        "description": "Redacted affidavit for the search warrant at Mar a Lago last month. Jan Lodal argues that the press and public are overlooking Donald Trump’s clearest offense. (Getty Images.)<p>Introduction from James Fallows: Jan Lodal has been a friend of mine for decades, and for even longer than that has held responsible positions involving military policy, the intelligence community, nuclear strategy, and similar realms. He has worked for presidents of both parties, starting with his role as a Pentagon aide handling classified data during Lyndon Johnson’s time, and then as a National Security Staff member under Henry Kissinger, in Richard Nixon’s White House. During the Clinton administration he had a senior Pentagon policy role. You get the idea.</p><p>In this guest post, Jan Lodal argues that most of the discussion of Donald Trump’s legal culpability is missing a fundamentally important point. As he explains, the Espionage Act of 1917, which is “still the primary statute governing our system of security for government secrets,” has six subparagraphs. And one of them, subparagraph (d), makes the issues surrounding Trump much starker and less subjective, both legally and politically, than they have come to seem.</p><p>Why am I posting this? Because I’ve come to trust Jan Lodal’s advice and judgment over the decades in my own writings about the military and about political accountability, and because it’s a perspective I have not seen highlighted so clearly elsewhere. I encourage comment and response.</p><p>Here is his case:</p><p>Share</p>No Return: Trump’s Most Obvious CrimeBy Jan Lodal                                <p>(Jan Lodal is Distinguished Fellow and Former President of The Atlantic Council, and Former Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, Policy. His email address is lodalopinions@gmail.com. )</p><p>Discussion of Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago papers has made the case seem complicated—legally, politically, and in terms of national security.</p><p>But one little-discussed aspect of the Espionage Act of 1917 is clear and unambiguous. I say this as someone who has spent much of his career dealing with the arcana of classified information.</p><p>If prosecutors simply focus on subparagraph (d) of the act, their case becomes clear and simple, and Trump’s violation is beyond all reasonable dispute. Let me explain the background of this clause, and why focus on it should allow us to move past the lamentable “special master” ruling and all its consequent and likely intended delay.</p><p>Now, the background:</p>The structure of the Espionage Act.<p>The Espionage Act is not the only point of investigation of documents in Donald Trump’s possession, or only possible crime. Widespread reporting confirms that some of these documents had the highest “SCI” (Sensitive Compartmented Information) or “SAP” (Special Access Program) markings.  Others apparently contained nuclear weapons “Restricted Data,” covered by separate laws and extremely tightly guarded.  Trump’s mishandling and wanton carelessness with these documents is totally unprecedented.</p><p>But the Espionage Act of 1917 is still the primary statute governing our system of security for government secrets.  This Act was already “old” when the current document classification system was put in place during World War II.  Convictions under it have often been difficult to obtain, for reasons I’ll explain.  Other than the Presidential Records Act, which has no criminal penalties, the Espionage Act is the main focus of investigations related to Mar-A-Lago.</p><p>The Espionage Act has six subparagraphs. The first three, subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c), require proof that the perpetrator improperly took or kept “information respecting the national defense” (in today’s law, “classified information”) “with intent or reason to believe that the information is to be used to the injury of the United States, or to the advantage of any foreign nation.”  In oversimplified words, this means that to be convicted the perpetrator has to be proved to have been a traitor or a spy.  No twelve person jury would unanimously convict Trump of being either a traitor or a spy. </p><p>Another provision, subparagraph (e) applies only to persons “having unauthorized possession” of “information respecting the national defense.”  As president, Trump clearly had “authorized possession” of all documents containing national defense information related to defense, and ex-presidents have often been kept up to date with classified briefings after they leave office.  Thus at least one juror could probably be convinced that Trump had “authorized possession” of the relevant “information related to the national defense”, making this subparagraph not applicable. </p><p>And the final Subparagraph (f) requires proving both “gross negligence,” always difficult, and that the perpetrator not only mishandled documents but also “failed to report” the mishandling to his “superior officer.” No one was “superior” to the President of the United States, so his behavior couldn’t meet this test.  </p>The importance of subparagraph (d).<p>But there is one remaining subparagraph of the Espionage Act that is unambiguously applicable to what Trump has done — subparagraph (d).  This paragraph makes a straightforward action a crime: namely, failing to return classified documents if properly directed to give them back.  No proof of the level of classification, or the intentions of the document holder, or the content of the documents, is required.  Just a simple question, did he or she give them back or not. </p><p>The only subjective or “soft” element of proof required by this paragraph is one easily met at trial. That is whether the perpetrator believed the information in the boxes “could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation.”   Even Trump had to believe that: it’s true by definition of any document that has been classified. You cannot classify a document otherwise.</p><p>This section of the Espionage Act does not require that prosecutors access or cite individual documents to prove the crime. It requires only that there were any classified documents in the boxes that Trump did not return. On that there is no doubt. It was settled by the release of the Department of Justice  (DoJ) Affidavit authorizing the Mar-A-Lago document seizure.</p><p>Trump was asked seven times to give the Mar-A-Lago documents back and did not comply, despite the clear requirement of this section of the Espionage Act.  The first request came from the National Archives, citing the Presidential Records Act.  They made three formal demands the he give them back.  Then the Department of Justice intervened and asked three more times but didn’t get them back.  Finally DoJ got a court subpoena ordering that he give them back, but he didn’t.  So the FBI had to forcibly take them. </p><p>Trump’s violation of this Subparagraph (d) of the Espionage Act could not be clearer.  Unlike all other crimes being considered for prosecution, Subsection (d) requires no probing of intent or consequence. It defines as criminal a clear process violation -- “failing to return” classified documents when properly asked to do so.  Proving this does not require opening up the boxes being re-analysed by the Special Master or even determining the extent of what he kept. The boxes have already been declared by authorities to contain classified information, which is all that must be proved to be covered by Subsection (d).  The boxes can remain closed for the trial, so even the attorneys and others in attendance do not need security clearances.  The testimony of the agents who reviewed them after they were seized should be adequate. </p><p>There is much at stake to hold Trump legally responsible.  But to do so will require avoiding the use of those elements of the law that could give any pro-Trump jurors an excuse to vote for acquittal.  The risk that this could happen is much greater if the crime asserted is defined by a “soft” standard requiring a subjective judgment on the state of mind or intentions of the perpetrator.  These are important elements found throughout the other sections of the Espionage Act, but are very limited in Subsection (d).</p>The problem with ‘soft’ standards, and the difference between what is damaging and what can be prosecuted. <p>I have personal experience with how “soft standards”  can block enforcement in cases brought under the Espionage Act,  even when the offense was extraordinarily damaging to U.S. national security.  I served in a senior Pentagon position under President Bill Clinton with responsibility for nuclear and arms control policy—a position I had previously held in the White House under Presidents Nixon and Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.  It came to my attention that a journalist had published a story that destroyed a communications intelligence system that gave us direct access to conversations of the highest Soviet leaders. </p><p>The journalist’s action was explicitly criminalized by 18 U.S. Code § 798, the “Communications Intelligence Protection Act.” This statute grew out of the increasing importance of what was once called “wiretapping”—intercepting telephone  communications. The Act includes restrictions not found in the Espionage Act, including prohibiting “publishing” “communications intelligence.  But the leadership of the Department of Justice assessed that First Amendment rights made this unconstitutional, despite the severe damage to national security the publication had done.  </p><p>Give a gift subscription</p><p>The same journalist was later emboldened to publish another “leak”—the details of a spectacular U.S. intelligence success that had uncovered the supply chain used by Iran in its pursuit of a nuclear weapon.  This intelligence facilitated a program to disrupt Iran’s nuclear weapons program’s supply chain.  Doing so might well have convinced the Iranian leadership that their nuclear weapons program could never be successful, so they should abandon it and join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Stopping the Iranian nuclear threat would have significantly reduced the nuclear risk that threatens all humanity.</p><p>No criminal investigation was undertaken in either of these incidents, so it would be improper to identify the individuals involved.  But these incidents, caused serious damage to the Nation’s security, demonstrate the difficulty of bringing criminal cases  under the Espionage Act unless the crime is spying or direct assistance to a foreign power.  And in these cases, the “process crimes” defined by Subsection (d) were not applicable.  So serious harm went unpunished. </p><p>Since our democracy relies on the public being able to know what its government is doing, punishing disclosure of government activities is only called for when a greater national interest demands it.  Any individual being punished needs to have clearly crossed a line between carrying out his or her legitimate duties and harming our national security or aiding a foreign power.</p><p>These potentially conflicting imperatives have placed great stress on defining when an action under the direct control of our president can be considered “criminal.” Although the president is responsible for enforcing federal criminal laws, he or she is subject to them like any other citizen. </p><p>The president is also responsible for the nation’s security against foreign threats. This security relies on enforcement of the Espionage Act, even if it requires accusing a former president of a crime—an extreme step.  These  conflicts have resulted in difficulties in the past and they are now impeding efforts to hold former president Trump accountable—even though his actions explicitly violate subsection (d) and may also violate other sections of the Espionage Act.  He has also unambiguously violated the White House Records Act, which requires him to submit records of his presidency to the National Archives.</p><p>Share</p>Prosecuting on ‘process,’ not on ‘intent.’<p>Donald Trump is not the first president to face these conflicts, even in recent times.  President Nixon falsely asserted that national security considerations justified his criminality.  An email scandal under former President Ronald Reagan led to the conviction of two of his senior aides, John Poindexter and Oliver North, for destroying public records by deleting hundreds of emails related to the Iran-Contra affair. President Reagan apologized for the scandal. </p><p>Poindexter’s and North’s conviction was a rare success for the Department of Justice in this area of law. The more common outcome, as in the cases I have alluded to, has been to drop the matter and just move forward.</p><p>But the Poindexter/North conviction can provide a lesson for our current situation.  The more difficult elements of the Espionage Act were not involved; what was prosecuted was a “process” crime, not a classic “espionage” crime.  Prosecutors did not have to establish that the perpetrators had “reason to believe” that their acts could harm the nation.  No proof of a certain “belief” or “state of mind” or other subjective criterion was required to convict them. They didn’t return documents and records when required to. QED.</p><p>The current situation is similar -- it also concerns a high ranking official, this time the very highest ranking, who violated a clear provision of law and knew he was doing so. He can be immediately prosecuted for a felony, without having to wait for the Special Master’s report or having to prove ambiguous “soft” elements of crimes. </p><p>Given our politics and our jury system, keeping the legal actions against Trump simple is better for now.  Prosecution for other offenses after getting an initial conviction will then be more likely to succeed.  DOJ  should take this path to reduce the risk that obfuscation and assertions of inapplicable rights and privileges by a former president could override the fragile rule of law in our constitutional democracy.</p><p>                                                              #</p><p>From James Fallows again: I am grateful to Jan Lodal for spelling out the issues so clearly.

        "description": "<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was surprised by former President Trump’s continued praise of Russian President Putin even after Moscow invaded Ukraine, given how much information Trump was privy to about the fellow world leader. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I believe he had enough time, plenty of time, to understand who Putin is,” Zelensky told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in an interview aired Sunday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think he was sitting at such a high position where it's not even possible not to recognize that [Putin] is the opponent in terms of values to your own people. He [Trump] has all the might of this country — intelligence, data — to create [a] psychological profile.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zelensky said he was “surprised” at Trump’s behavior “even after the beginning, with a full-fledged invasion.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Probably he needed this to promote his domestic policy to show that he's ready to find understanding with the President of Russia,” Zelensky speculated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Ukraine in his eyes is too far away. But this war has no distances it could not cover, so I believe he needs to look at the situation without, as we say, pink glasses on,” Zelensky said, per CNN's translation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump lauded Putin’s military moves leading up to the invasion in February as “genius” and “savvy,” comments that drew ire even from some in his own party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) refuted Trump’s “genius” comments, and Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said his “adulation” of the Russian president “aids our enemies.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the invasion, Trump said he was “surprised” that Putin had gone through with the attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I thought he was negotiating when he sent his troops to the border. I thought he was negotiating,” Trump told the Washington Examiner in an interview. “I thought it was a tough way to negotiate but a smart way to negotiate.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>Christopher Silvester is a freelance journalist and author. He’s currently a columnist for The Critic and writes obituaries for The Times. He has previously reported for Britain’s satirical magazine Private Eye and written for Vanity Fair and The New Yorker. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As news broke of Queen Elizabeth’s death, the staff at London’s Garrick Club immediately donned black armbands, placing a large portrait of the Queen on an easel at the entrance to the upstairs bar. At dinner, in the Coffee Room, a senior club member tapped a glass and asked everyone present to be upstanding and toast the departed monarch, Britain’s longest-serving sovereign. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another member interjected as an afterthought: “To the King . . . Long Live the King.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Queen was being toasted in this storied London establishment, frequented by many Royals throughout the centuries, crowds were swelling outside Buckingham Palace, marking a monumental transition across a mourning, and surprised, nation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, a lot that’s been familiar for 70 years will change. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only two days before, the Queen had bid farewell to her fourteenth prime minister, Boris Johnson, and greeted her fifteenth, Liz Truss. The official photograph of their meeting had been revealing. Not only did she seem frail, although impeccably turned out, but the top part of her extended hand was blackened.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t fanciful to suppose that the Queen, like many a person approaching death, was determined to reach a particular final milestone before giving up the ghost. But when she did, it was still a jolt for a nation so used to her. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Friday, all of London was on pause, except around Buckingham Palace. Trade unions postponed planned strikes for national mourning; sports matches were cancelled. Watching coverage on GB News — Britain’s equivalent of Fox News — it was telling how even former United States President Donald Trump struck a temperate, even reverential, note, his ego evidently gaining the upper hand over his overcharged id. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So much will seem different now. King Charles III’s name, image and insignia will begin to appear on banknotes, coins, stamps, post boxes, passports and police helmets — not just here in the United Kingdom but in some Commonwealth nations too.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Queen’s Award for this or that will become the King’s Award. Senior barristers and solicitors appointed by the monarch will switch from being Queen’s Counsel to King’s Counsel. And the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s children will become Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, just as had always been intended once the line of succession moved on a notch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it isn’t only the symbols of monarchy that will change as King Charles assumes leadership of “the Firm.” As the new chairman and CEO of the business, he’ll have his work cut out for him, filling his mother’s sensible shoes.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already, his plans for a slimmed-down monarchy to help preserve the institution had been approved by the late Queen. And while his mother had little time to train for the job, her father dying young, Charles has prepared for this moment his entire adult life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coincidentally, Britain recently marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the death of Princess Diana, which had seriously damaged the Firm’s public standing, Charles’ reputation in particular. </p>\n\n\n\nKing Charles III during a reception with Realm High Commissioners and their spouses in the Bow Room at Buckingham Palace on September 11, 2022 | Victoria Jones-WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\n\n\n<p>For years afterward, he was so unpopular, many wished fervently that some constitutional mechanism might be introduced, whereby the Crown would skip a generation, passing straight to Diana’s eldest son, Prince William. That was never going to happen — it would have broken the bonds linking Britain’s monarchy back to Athelstan of Wessex, the first king of England and the thirtieth great-grand-uncle to Queen Elizabeth II. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, since Diana’s death, Charles has worked unstintingly to make his way back in public favor, embarking on an incremental process of rehabilitation, whereby his former mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles, initially became his unofficial companion, only formally introduced to the Queen in 2000. She then married Charles in 2005, becoming the Duchess of Cornwall, as well as the Duchess of Rothesay in Scotland. And from 2005 until 2022, it was stated several times that she would be styled Princess Consort, rather than Queen Consort, when Charles succeeded to the throne. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the long process culminated in the Queen finally naming Camilla as Queen Consort in her Accession Day message earlier this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of his plan to conserve the monarchy for the future, King Charles III will now preside over a toned down institution in which there will only be seven working members: the King and his Queen Consort; the new Prince of Wales, William, and new Duchess of Cornwall, Kate; the Princess Royal, Anne; Prince Edward; and the Duchess of Wessex, Sophie. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, there are multiple threats that could undermine the monarchy, unless Charles is careful and able to contain them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is how to handle his brother Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. Andrew was forced to withdraw from public life by the Queen, Charles, and William back in 2019, when Virginia Robert Giuffre brought a civil suit against him for sexual assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress, claiming she had been trafficked to the prince by pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. The wisdom of their decision to sideline him was confirmed when he settled the suit for an undisclosed sum of money, believed to be around £12 million.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this year’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations, Andrew’s only public role was that of a loving son escorting his frail mother to church services. But it’s widely suspected he yearns for some renewed public role, however minor, and begrudges his obscurity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as U.S. prosecutors keep an open file on the Jeffrey Epstein case, however, it makes sense to keep Prince Andrew under a form of benign house arrest. However, as a sop to Andrew, his eldest daughter Princess Beatrice will become a royal counsellor, which means she would deputize for one of the senior members of the family when they are ill. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The King’s next challenge then comes with Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, with little sign that either is willing to curb their criticism of the Royal family. Buckingham Palace is braced for the publication of Harry’s autobiography, fearful of the claims he might make. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Sussexes are obsessed by self-promotion at the expense of the royal family,” noted the Duchess’ biographer, Tom Bower. “Harry’s fate now depends on successfully promoting his poisonous auto-biography. High sales success depend on smearing his family.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charles reached out to Harry and Meghan in his first address to the nation as its new monarch, wishing them love and happiness. But whether such sentiments will survive the book’s publication at the end of the year remains to be seen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the other dark cloud over Charles’ reign comes from his own past. A cash-for-access scandal involving his private charities forced his his long-standing aide Michael Fawcett to resign. Further media scrutiny this summer also drew attention to Charles being given bags full of cash as charitable donations by an Arab sheikh. And though there have been no suggestions of any impropriety involved on his part, it does suggest he can be careless.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that he’s King, Charles will also have to step back from promoting some of the causes he has strongly advocated for, including climate action and other environmental issues.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has said he expects Britain’s new monarch will look to Prince William to promote the causes he’s been passionate about. There will be no more so-called “black spider” letters to prime ministers and cabinet ministers — so-called due to his spidery ink signature — urging action on this or that matter.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But just as he recently told a documentary filmmaker at the BBC, he’s not stupid and understands the danger of getting embroiled in politics — a change he referred to in his first speech to the nation. The future of the monarchy hangs in the balance. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Paul Taylor, a contributing editor at POLITICO, writes the “Europe At Large” column.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>PARIS — Like a band that only knows two tunes, the overwhelmingly white, male and elderly membership of Britain’s Conservative Party has given the nation a replica of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister to succeed a pantomime version of Winston Churchill felled by scandals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a biographer of Churchill, sought to imitate the wartime leader’s swagger and oratory but showed none of his strategic depth, Liz Truss has chosen to imitate the dress code, strident tone and arch-conservative ideology of Thatcher, while ignoring her heroine’s record as co-founder and champion of the European Union’s single market. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not only are the Tories’ greatest hits no longer in vogue with the electorate, they are ill-adapted to the day’s domestic and international circumstances. And Truss, the fourth Conservative prime minister in six years of political turmoil, seems likely to be a fag-end leader, with a cabinet that looks like a Light Brigade of right-wing loyalists and hardcore Brexiteers charging into a socioeconomic Valley of Death.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although no one in government will admit it, the United Kingdom’s economy has been weakened by Britain’s exit from the EU. The country currently has the highest inflation rate among major industrialized countries, growing labor unrest, rising separatism in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and diminishing influence in Brussels and Washington.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truss risks incurring the same fate as James Callaghan, who succeeded Harold Wilson in Downing Street in the late 1970s, when the governing Labour Party was exhausted, had run out of ideas and faced stagflation, strikes and factional feuding, culminating in the “winter of discontent” of 1978-79.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doomed Labour to 18 years in opposition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, Truss’s demeanor as a minister and leadership candidate suggests she is a two-dimensional, confrontational politician, with a tin ear for social distress and an innate insensitivity to the U.K.’s main foreign relationships in Europe and North America.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If she goes about implementing the policies she championed during the Tory contest, she could trigger a trade war with the EU — the U.K.’s largest trading partner — provoke more strikes at home, and stoke inflation, making all but the wealthiest Britons poorer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her attempts to channel Thatcher as a free-market, small-state Iron Lady, Truss also lacks the fundamental component of a pantomime villain on whom to target national anger, as her heroine did with Argentine military dictator Leopoldo Galtieri during the Falklands War, or the National Union of Mineworkers Marxist leader Arthur Scargill during the 1983-84 miners’ strike.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her maiden speech, the new prime minister squarely blamed the U.K.’s cost of living and energy problems on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and on the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic without, of course, mentioning the damage of Brexit— an approach that may not assuage the public if she doggedly refuses to tax energy companies’ windfall profits to help heat their homes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while the death of Queen Elizabeth gave Truss an opportunity to embody the nation’s grief and lead it in mourning, her wooden tribute to the longest-reigning monarch paled in comparison with former Prime Minister Tony Blair’s heartfelt eulogy for Princess Diana as “the people’s princess.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truss’ Thatcherian platform of tax cuts and deregulation appealed to the 81,000 hardline Tories who voted for her — which makes up 0.15 percent of the total electorate — but it’s out of sync with global trends toward state intervention in energy markets and supply chains, and greater public investment in infrastructure and green energy. </p>\n\n\n\nBritain’s Conservative Party has given the nation a replica of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister | Fresco/Daily Express/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\n\n\n<p>Her vaunted disdain for advice from civil servants suggests she’ll find it hard to pivot to pragmatism unless she’s convinced her political survival is at stake, as she apparently was on household energy bills. But she seems much less likely to make a U-turn toward Europe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having supported the “Remain” cause in the 2016 referendum on EU membership, Truss appeased the most anti-European faction of her party, introducing a bill to tear up the trade arrangements between the U.K. and Northern Ireland in the EU withdrawal agreement Johnson negotiated, signed and then reneged on.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While that legislation is being debated in the House of Lords, which opposes the government’s threat to violate international law, Truss now has time to change tack and cut a deal with Brussels, or to double down on confrontation by triggering an article in the Northern Ireland Protocol that would allow either side to suspend the agreement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She told parliament her preference is for a negotiated solution, and United States President Joe Biden pushed her to compromise in their first phone call. But it’s not clear whether Truss will be willing to face down the hardline Protestant unionists and Tory sovereigntists who want to kill the protocol, which mandates border checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain, since the territory remains within the EU single market.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She gave a private preview of her abrasive style back in July at an informal annual Franco-British meeting in Versailles, when, according to participants, she failed — or didn’t bother — to read the room, and delivered a jarring speech lionizing Great Global Britain and the Anglosphere.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her British exceptionalism went down like a lead balloon, following a year in which the U.S. and the U.K. secretly negotiated the so-called AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine deal with Australia, prompting Canberra to scrap a deal signed with France for conventional submarines. Some of the Brits in the room were as embarrassed by Truss’s lack of sensitivity as the French were dismayed by her assertive nationalism.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The closed-door hectoring later went public during one of the Conservative hustings events, when Truss was asked whether French President Emmanuel Macron was a friend or a foe, and she replied that “the jury is still out” and she would judge him by his deeds, not his words. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems unlikely that behind-the-scenes coordination between London and Brussels on Russia sanctions policy, which began when Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine in February, will grow into anything more substantial on her watch. Truss, much like Johnson, has missed no opportunity to claim that the U.K.’s strong military support for Kyiv was due to the “freedom” of Brexit — though tell that to the Poles or Balts who have poured weapons into Ukraine without leaving the EU. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the prevailing view in Brussels, Paris and Berlin is that things will likely get worse with London before they get better, and that European governments will have to wait Truss out and hope for a turning point after the next U.K. general election, which must be held by January 2025. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Saim Saeed is agriculture editor at POLITICO Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a large statue of Queen Victoria in the middle of Kolkata, once the capital of British India. There, she sits on a throne, holding an orb in one hand, representing the world, and a scepter in the other, representing her power over it. The statue symbolizes the imperial might the monarchy projected in Britain’s colonies, even as its position back home was far more benign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how ceremonial the monarchy’s role might be in Britain, it has a separate, more malevolent legacy for the over two billion people living in the countries that were ruled in the crown’s name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as the British colonies secured their independence, Queen Elizabeth II was in the unique position to explicitly distance herself from the imperial actions of her predecessors — or even better, atone for them — carving out a more just and equitable relationship between them and Britain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, she didn’t do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was no apology, no regret, no shame, no reparation, no moral responsibility or reckoning by Queen Elizabeth II over the crimes that were committed in the crown’s name. Instead, the late queen applied a more cynical, if effective, approach that refashioned her as the symbol of a modern, friendly Britain, even as the institution she presided over remained — and still remains — as conservative as ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The queen didn’t commit any of Britain’s colonial crimes — though it is unclear how much she knew about the violent suppression of rebellions in Kenya, Yemen and Cyprus that took place under her watch. But her rigid apoliticism and insistence on ceremony meant she shied away from any meaningful engagement with her country’s colonial past, or acknowledgment of its sins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the case of the Koh-i-noor diamond. One of the world’s largest cut diamonds, the Kohinoor was surrendered to the British monarchy when it annexed the Indian kingdom of Punjab in 1849, and it’s been wedged into the Crown Jewels ever since. It’s why India was referred to as the “Jewel in the Crown” of the British Empire, its most prized possession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Immediately upon independence in 1947, India asked for the diamond back, only to be rebuffed. In 1976, Pakistan formally asked for it too, former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto writing to the United Kingdom, saying that returning the stone “would be a convincing demonstration of the spirit that moved Britain voluntarily to shed its imperial encumbrances and lead the process of decolonisation.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, neither the queen nor her government acquiesced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, she worked hard on spin, taking part in a rebranding that transformed Britain’s empire into the Commonwealth. Rather than a literal map of all the places where her predecessors ruled, she refashioned it into a club of friendly peers that play cricket and rugby, and practice common law. Not only that, many former colonies kept her as their head of state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that colonial nostalgia has much to do with the U.K.’s decision to leave the European Union, and the crucial role that Britain’s leaders hope the Commonwealth will play in its attempt to go “global,” how it has managed this relationship has political consequences as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Queen Elizabeth carefully avoided anything remotely political, ignoring her own institution’s history, focusing instead on cutting ribbons, visiting charities, waving, handbags, her dogs and her reputation. It meant that even those bearing imperial grudges wouldn’t look at her, and by extension her institution, for redress or reparations. Weddings, divorces, childbirths — events holding no political or moral weight became the preeminent feature of her professional life.</p>\n\n\n\nThe Koh-I-Noor diamond on display with other famous diamonds at an exhibition intitled “100 World Famous Diamonds” |  STR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\n\n<p>This stands in contrast to her peer, King Philippe of Belgium, who is publicly trying to come to terms with his country’s horrific colonial legacy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — another place where the monarchy played an outsized role — and it even diverges from her own family, as King Charles III and Prince William have both been more upfront in at least acknowledging historical evils.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some countries are breaking the spell, however. Barbados became a republic last year, removing the British monarch as its head of state. And it’s worth noting that Charles, who attended the ceremony, commented on “the appalling atrocity of slavery” that “forever stains our history.” Elizabeth simply wished the country well for the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also a growing republican movement in Australia and Canada, where Indigenous populations were killed in large numbers by British colonial authorities and settlers. And on a recent tour of the Caribbean, William faced protests in Belize and Jamaica calling for an apology and reparations for slavery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“During her 70 years on the throne, your grandmother has done nothing to redress and atone for the suffering of our ancestors that took place during her reign and/or during the entire period of British trafficking of Africans, enslavement, indentureship and colonization,” wrote one of the protest groups, the Advocates Network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the messages of condolence pouring in today, many from the Commonwealth countries, express little of that sentiment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, during her long reign, Queen Elizabeth’s charm meant that that her former subjects in Pakistan, Fiji and Nigeria would line the streets holding garlands as she drove by, when they should have been waving pitchforks. Her legacy, essentially, is an extraordinary PR coup. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Via the New York Times, here's a chart from Child Trends that shows how much the social safety net has reduced child poverty over the past 35 years:</p>\n<p>Before 1986 the social safety net was almost nonexistent for children. Altogether, it reduced child poverty by only 1%.</p>\n\nIn 1986, Ronald Reagan's Tax Reform Act increased the Earned Income Tax Credit, and by 1993 the safety net was responsible for a reduction in child poverty of 9%.\nIn 1993, Bill Clinton increased the EITC again, and by 1996 the safety net was responsible for a reduction in child poverty of 18%.\nIn 1996 Clinton passed welfare reform and by 2017 the safety net was responsible for a reduction in child poverty of 36%.\nIn 2017 Donald Trump passed the 2017 Tax Act, which included an expansion of the Child Tax Credit. By 2019 the safety net was responsible for a reduction in child poverty of 44%.\n\n<p>There were other things along the way, some permanent, some not. But the bottom line is simple: today about 11% of children live in poverty. Without the social safety net erected over the past 35 years, that number would be 21%. That's 7.6 million children who no longer live in poverty thanks to federal and state safety net programs.</p>\n<p>POSTSCRIPT: The \"poverty line\" is strictly a cash measure, so it's worth pointing out that tens of millions of children have also been helped by Bill Clinton's Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Free health care doesn't get counted in the poverty calculations, though.</p>\n\nFacebook  \nTwitter \nEmail\nPrint",

        "description": "Peter Aiken-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>It was the twentieth time the Tigers failed to score a run in a game this season.</p> <p>After a soggy, rain-shortened win on Saturday, the Detroit Tigers had their sights set on a series sweep on a much cooler, breezier Sunday. However, they ran into a great starting pitcher and couldn’t get anything going with the bats, dropping the finale 4-0.</p>\n<p>Tyler Alexander toed the rubber for the Tigers today. Since joining the rotation at the end of July, Alexander’s results have been... well... “Not great, Bob!”: eight starts, 39 innings pitched, 6.23 ERA, .890 OPS against, and nine home runs surrendered. He had a great seven-inning outing against Cleveland in early August, but for his three starts previous to today he didn’t get out of the fifth inning in any of them. I mean, maybe Alexander likes starting more than relieving, but I’m not sure than, other than an occasional spot-start, I think the bullpen — perhaps a long-relief role, which I’ve always felt goes sorely undervalued in a bullpen mix — is better suited to his particular set of skills.</p>\n<p>Facing Alexander was Brady Singer, whose season so far has been pretty darn solid. He doesn’t strike out everyone, but he gets his fair share; he limits the walks, by-and-large; he gives up a home run every now and again but doesn’t make a habit of it. He’s shown a marked improvement since 2021, and if he stays healthy he can be an important member of the Royals’ rotation for years to come. Oh, and he’s been pretty stingy against the Tigers in his career overall, holding them to a .666 OPS in nine starts coming into today. Notably, he’s struck out more Tigers than any other opponent — which, given the free-swinging nature of our boys the past couple of seasons, doesn’t come as a huge surprise.</p>\n<p>Alexander got into trouble early, when a pair of one-out singles in the first put runners on the corners. A Martin Prado sacrifice fly scored a run, but then Salvador Perez got caught in a rundown between first and second trying to advance and that ended the inning. The Royals then made it a 3-0 game in the second courtesy of Drew Waters, who poked a two-out, two-run double into the right-field corner.</p>\n<p>Michael Massey mashed a meatball down the middle, the first pitch of the fourth, over the fence in right field to make it 4-0 for the Missourians.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Singer was cruising: plenty of ground balls, a sprinkling of strikeouts, and very little hard contact. Through five innings he’d struck out five, gave up two singles, and only thrown 58 pitches.</p>\n<p>Nice play by both Tucker Barnhart and Ryan Kreidler in the bottom of the fifth: Perez struck out as Bobby Witt Jr. was trying to steal third base. Barnhart gunned the ball to third, and Kreidler made a sensational tag on Witt as he was sliding.</p>\n\n\n<p>Tucker Barnhart nabs the speedy Bobby Witt Jr. trying to steal third! #DetroitRoots@Tucker_Barnhart | @Ryan_Kreidler pic.twitter.com/WEKki6wrwO</p>— Bally Sports Detroit (@BallySportsDET) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The Tigers caught a bad break in the sixth: Victor Reyes hit a smash down the first-base line which was deflected by Royals first baseman Nick Pratto... and then it hit first-base umpire Lew Williams. Pratto picked up the ball, lunged, and tagged first base with his glove to retire Reyes. That took what was probably a sure double away from Reyes, and was one of the few hard-hit balls off Singer.</p>\n<p>Alexander’s final line wasn’t great, and looks pretty similar to what he’s been doing over the past month or so, for the most part: five innings, four runs, a walk, two strikeouts, and a home run surrendered. Alex Lange took over for the sixth and, like Alexander did in the first, put runners on the corners with one out — but, unlike Alexander, he managed to get out of the inning without giving up a run.</p>\n<p>In the seventh, Spencer Torkelson poked a one-out double down the left field line and was wild-pitched to third. Singer then struck out Kerry Carpenter on a high fastball, and Jonathan Schoop hit a high chopper to third which Hunter Dozier deftly handled, gunning a throw to first base for the third out.</p>\n<p>Joe Jiménez took over for Lange to start the bottom of the seventh, and struck out the side. My goodness, he looked nasty. Absolutely overpowering.</p>\n<p>Gregory Soto, perhaps looking to get some work in, came in for the eighth — and he looked good. Had the slider going, which is nice.</p>\n<p>In the ninth the Royals put Scott Barlow out to nail down the game, which he did. At least it was a series win, though, right?</p>\nNumbers and Observations\n\nComing into today’s game, Kerry Carpenter rode a three-game streak of two-hit games, including a pair of home runs and a double — while only striking out twice in those three games combined.\nAt the end of the 10-0 drubbing last Monday, Eric Haase’s batting average and OPS .233 and .681, respectively. Three games later, they were at .257 and .761 — not numbers that’d set the world on fire, but holy moly, what a three-game stretch.\nAlex Lange ditched his traditional mock-turtleneck look today.\nI know that these days a lot of people are paying attention to the football field. And I absolutely know what your number one question is: are the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for real? It sure looks that way.\nOn this date in the year 9 CE — it’s not often that I get to go single-digits on here — the Romans had their butts handed to them at the Battle of the Teutoberg Forest. Up to this encounter, the Romans had been expanding their empire all willy-nilly across western Europe... but after this, they were pretty much limited to territory east of the Rhine. Take that, Augustus!",

        "description": "<p>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Former President George W. Bush took part in a first ball ceremony in Texas, Aaron Judge put on special cleats at Yankee Stadium and the New York Mets wore first responder caps as Major League Baseball paused Sunday to remember the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were moments of silence, remembrances and tributes at ballparks all across America on the 21st anniversary of 9/11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s a moment in our country’s history. We all have certain things we remember, where we were when it happened and how we felt. So many people involved, so it’s a chance to honor those people today. Realizing the people and families that were affected by this that are still feeling the pain from it,\" Mets manager Buck Showalter said before a game in Miami.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bush, who was president on the day of the attacks, was at Globe Life Field as the Rangers played Toronto. He joined Jimmy Pollozani, a police officer in nearby Fort Worth, and Pollozani’s 13-year-old daughter, Andita, in the ceremony.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They represented police officers, firefighters and first responders across the state. Andita threw the pitch to Rocky Wolfe, a firefighter from the central Texas city of Killeen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bush famously delivered a perfect strike before Game 3 of the 2001 World Series at Yankee Stadium between the Yankees and Arizona Diamondbacks weeks after New York City’s twin towers fell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a moment of silence before the Blue Jays and Rangers played. During the Canadian and U.S. national anthems, Bush stood between Texas interim manager Tony Beasley and first base coach Corey Ragsdale in front of the home dugout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bush delivered the ball to Andita and gave her a hug and a word of advice before she threw from just in front of the mound. Afterward, Bush gave a fist bump to her father before they left the field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bush received rousing applause when he was announced. As he headed toward the Rangers’ dugout afterward, some fans chanted, “USA! USA!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All Rangers and Blue Jays personnel in uniform wore a special Patriot Day patch on their caps. Special lineup cards and base jewels were used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bush was part of the investment group that owned the Rangers from April 1989 until June 1998 and remains involved with the club. He and wife Laura have lived in Dallas since he left the White House in January 2009.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Yankee Stadium as New York played Tampa Bay, Judge wore cleats marking the day. His left cleat had “9/11 Patriot Day” on the back and the right one had “9-11-01.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Yankees wore hats in tribute of 9/11 responders rather than their interlocking NY.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starter Domingo Germán’s cap said NYPD and there was a mix of FDNY. He sprinted to the bullpen to warm up holding an American flag in his right hand, drawing cheers from a crowd that had been sitting through a rain delay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Germán said he was inspired by watching Sammy Sosa running with a flag in the Chicago Cubs’ first home game following the attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It was a way to show support to the country, to the people, the victims, and today I felt like it was a good way to kind of replicate that and show that horrific event, you remember what happened, and that it’s close to your heart,” Germán said through a translator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“That moment marked me as a kid, so I always felt that given the opportunity, given the right time, I wanted to do it, and it happened here with the Yankees. I guess it’s something that my kids can see and hopefully use it as inspiration,\" he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manager Aaron Boone placed a wreath at the monument in Monument Park that was dedicated on the first anniversary of the attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yankee Stadium public address announcer Paul Olden began a brief pregame ceremony by calling the attacks “an unsuccessful attempt to break the spirit of our great nation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firefighter Regina Wilson sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” after the Port Authority Honor Guard presented the colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mets wore caps with insignias representing New York first responder departments. Featured were the city’s police and fire departments as well as Port Authority Police and departments of sanitation and correction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony Varvaro, a former big league pitcher who retired in 2016 to become Port Authority police officer, was killed in a car accident Sunday morning in New Jersey on his way to work at the Sept. 11 memorial ceremony in Manhattan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Varvaro, 37, was born in Staten Island and played at St. John’s before becoming a reliever for Seattle, Atlanta and Boston from 2010-15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are deeply saddened on the passing of former Braves pitcher Anthony Varvaro,” the Braves said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and colleagues.”</p>",

His next step is to stay in that zone more consistently.</p>\n<p>“It’s not really about changing anything, it’s just getting (my swing) off the right way,” McMahon said Sunday after hitting a two-run homer in the eighth inning of the Rockies’ 12-6 loss to Arizona. “It’s about doing things the right way and not getting too big and trying to hit homers and things like that.”</p>\n<p>McMahon hit three homers in the six-game homestand and has 16 this season, though he’s likely going to come up far short of the career-high 24 homers he swatted in 2019.</p>\n<p>“I think you guys have seen this from me before, I’ve seen it for myself and my teammates have seen it,” he said. “The next step is to do it for a full season.”</p>\n<p>Manager Bud Black and the staff have been trying to coax McMahon to shorten up his swing, something that would allow McMahon to drive the ball more.</p>\n<p>“He’s working on it,” Black said. “It’s been kind of a constant for him, to try to get there and shorten that swing. He’s got power within that shorter swing. But it doesn’t happen overnight, and it doesn’t happen within months or even years sometimes, but he’s aware.</p>\n<p>“You see, at times, shorter strokes. That’s where he needs to gain the trust; that it’s OK to have that type of swing.”</p>\n<p>Stop, thief. The Rockies allowed six stolen bases for the first time since June 24, 2016, vs. Arizona. It marked the fifth time in franchise history that Colorado has allowed six or more stolen bases.</p>\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies’ four-game winning streak ends with ugly loss to D-backs\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tProgressive catching guru Jerry Weinstein one of Rockies’ hidden treasures: “He’s a hard (blank), but in the very best way”\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tC.J.

        "description": "<p>This story contains spoilers for Season 1, Episode 4 of House of the Dragon.</p><p>Like a court musician ordered to strum a princess’s favorite tunes under a Weirwood tree, HBO’s House of the Dragon knows how to play all the hits that satisfy Game of Thrones fans. The small-council meetings crackle with passive-aggressive tension. The sets look eye-popping, the dragons only more so. The battle sequences appear to spill enough blood to fill the Narrow Sea. Little can feel truly fresh about a show that takes place in such a familiar setting, with such familiar politicking at play.</p><p>The one thing keeping this sense of déjà vu from being completely overwhelming has been the childhood friendship between Rhaenyra Targaryen (played by Milly Alcock), the first female heir to the Iron Throne, and Alicent Hightower (Emily Carey), the daughter of the Hand of the King. In Fire &amp; Blood, the book on which the series is based, no such intimacy exists between the characters. The pair have the cordial rapport expected of noblewomen—that is, until Alicent bears the king, Viserys, a son who threatens to supplant Rhaenyra in the line of succession. From that point on, the two become political rivals. But the TV series at first seemed to give these characters a fascinating dynamic that the franchise has rarely explored: a true female friendship.</p><p>The small-screen adaptation of the author George R. R. Martin’s work has certainly been lacking when it comes to such relationships. Daenerys Targaryen and her handmaiden Missandei’s camaraderie was predicated on the latter being a subordinate; the same went for Sansa Stark and her handmaiden, Shae. Though Alicent is one of Rhaenyra’s ladies-in-waiting when they are young, they are both nobles and thus on slightly more equal footing. They both have close ties to power, but no expectations of wielding it in adulthood. Their distinct personalities in the pilot suggested they would make good foils for each other: Alicent is dutiful and restrained; Rhaenyra, plucky and unruly. Especially once Rhaenyra was unexpectedly named her father’s heir, House of the Dragon seemed poised to show how their relationship would evolve as a consequence of growing up in a system that prioritizes power above all else, and that treats friendships as nothing but currency.</p><p>[Read: House of the Dragon is messy, cruel, and fascinating]</p><p>Yet the series has squandered much of that potential. In Episode 3, the show’s timeline skips ahead two to three years from where Episode 2 left off—when Viserys (Paddy Considine) chooses Alicent as his second wife. The period it glosses over could have shed light on how Alicent and Rhaenyra’s bond shapes their lives in court after their surprising rises to power. Instead, the show doesn’t explicitly make clear what happened between the two after Alicent becomes Rhaenyra’s stepmother. (Which is certainly salacious, but such twisted ties are common among Westerosi, and particularly Targaryen, royalty.) The few scenes between them have been awkward, suggesting the two stopped being as warm as they once were toward each other, but never examine the emotional stakes of their altered relationship. Scrutinizing the women’s conflicting ideas of duty and love as the source of their strain would have made the show far more interesting.</p><p>Tonight’s episode, which attempted to draw connections between Alicent and Rhaenyra’s romantic relationships, was particularly frustrating to watch. One scene cuts between shots of Alicent obediently going to bed with Viserys and shots of Rhaenyra being seduced by her uncle, Daemon (Matt Smith), in a sweaty brothel. The parallel—that the women both have unfulfilling sexual encounters—is vague and rather cheap, considering the two have barely spoken of love on the show. Later, when Alicent confronts Rhaenyra about the rumors of her night with Daemon, the encounter makes little sense. Why would Alicent be so concerned about Rhaenyra, and Rhaenyra so hurt by Alicent’s accusation? It’s been years since they spent time reading together in the godswood. Viewers have seen nothing but iciness in between.</p><p>[Read: The glaring flaw at the heart of House of the Dragon]</p><p>Some of this ambiguity is because the show has failed to give Alicent’s character much depth at all. Yes, she’s in plenty of scenes, discussing succession with Viserys and her father, Otto (Rhys Ifans), but all we know is she’s an obedient wife and mother who watches closely from the sidelines of every set piece. In Fire &amp; Blood, Martin describes how Alicent’s betrothal to Viserys is plagued by rumors that she seduced the king, or that she’d been deflowered by Daemon. Martin suggests that Alicent came to devote her life to her duties as queen, partly to ensure that her reputation never becomes sullied. The TV adaptation’s rush to speed through the plot blows past her evolution.</p><p>That’s a shame, too, for the show’s depiction of Westeros. If these early episodes had paid more attention to Rhaenyra and Alicent’s friendship during their younger years, their rift could have deepened the audience’s appreciation of the brutality of this medieval world, beyond the routine bloodshed. For women, such a setting is dangerous not only when it comes to childbirth or sexual violence; it is also a place where the most innocent of friendships can be torn apart by societal notions of responsibility and purity. Rhaenyra and Alicent are two of the most protected women in Westeros, and yet they’re not free of the burdens of reputation. Seeing them as confidants—true confidants, not just characters standing close to each other in a handful of scenes—would have given viewers a new angle through which to view the world of ice and fire.</p><p>I understand House of the Dragon’s need to prioritize plot and focus on showing the Targaryens’ progression toward their eventual demise. But for a show that, according to its producers, aimed to focus on “the patriarchy’s perception of women” and how characters such as Rhaenyra get “boxed out of a man’s world,” the limited imagination for their friendship is disappointing. Soon, a new cast will take over the roles to portray the pair in older age, helping the story barrel toward the civil war that leads to the end of a dynasty. By then, Rhaenyra and Alicent’s original friendship will probably be nothing more than a footnote. Westeros’s leadership may not respect women, but no one is disrespecting these characters more than the writers of House of the Dragon themselves.</p>",

At times, he’s looked like his old self, but there’s been a few outings where he hasn’t had a good command of his pitches, leaving too many in the middle of the plate, and this was one of those. </p>\n<p>After Duran’s outstanding stretch, López came in and allowed singles to Myles Straw and Steven Kwan, and then got Amed Rosario to ground out. Jose Ramirez was intentionally walked to fill the bases, then Josh Naylor drilled a two-run double to give the Guardians a couple insurance runs. Luckily, he dialed it in from there and got the last two outs of the inning without any further damage.</p>\n<p>The Twins got a couple of men on base in the bottom half of the inning with walks to Gilberto Celestino and Nick Gordon, but strikeouts from Gio Urshela, Kyle Garlick, and Jermaine Palacios would end the game. No hair fondling of James Karinchak needed this time.</p>\n<p>Minnesota isn’t dead yet. They still have one of the easiest remaining schedules remaining in MLB with series against the Royals, Angels, and Tigers still to play this season. The Twins also have five more head-to-head games with Cleveland and three with Chicago. There’s still time, but it’s dwindling. </p>\n<p>After the sweep, the Twins are 4.5 games back of the Guardians and 2 games behind the White Sox. Fangraphs currently gives the Twins a 7.5% chance to win the division. Not impossible, but surely difficult. </p>\n<p>Finally, if you’ll indulge me, I want to end on a more optimistic note. Is it disappointing how far the Twins have fallen since their hot start? Absolutely! However, I think fans would do well to remember how short-handed this team has been since June. </p>\n<p>The point has been made in Tweet after Tweet and blog post after blog post, but it really can’t be overstated how serious the Twins’ injury situation has been. They have the most games lost of any team, by a wide margin. </p>\n\n\n<p>#MLB Team Injuries MostDays Missed:1,410 days - Twins1,174 days - Reds1,036 days - Dodgers1,013 days - Nationals891 days - Cubs849 days - Tigers793 days - Yankees</p>— Keat_on (@keatN34) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Currently on the injured list, you could almost make a full starting lineup, starting rotation, and bullpen. This doesn’t even factor in the significant time that Carlos Correa, Max Kepler, Sonny Gray, and Joe Ryan have missed this season.</p>\n<p>C - Ryan Jeffers</p>\n<p>1B - Miguel Sano</p>\n<p>2B - Jorge Polanco</p>\n<p>SS - Royce Lewis</p>\n<p>OF - Byron Buxton</p>\n<p>OF - Alex Kirilloff</p>\n<p>OF - Trevor Larnach</p>\n<p>SP - Tyler Mahle</p>\n<p>SP - Chris Paddack</p>\n<p>SP - Kenta Maeda</p>\n<p>SP - Bailey Ober</p>\n<p>SP - Randy Dobnak</p>\n<p>RP - Jorge Alcala</p>\n<p>RP - Cody Stashak</p>\n<p>RP - Danny Coulombe</p>\n<p>RP - Jhon Romero</p>\n<p>Everyone on that list outside of Kenta Maeda and Jhon Romero was expected to be major contributors this year. The fact that the Twins have competed for the division at all this season, and still have a chance to have a hot three weeks and win it, is incredible.</p>\n<p>Twins fans are always ready to be disappointed, but this isn’t just a Minnesota sports curse, it’s unprecedented bad injury luck. No one planned on playing an outfield of Jake Cave, Gilberto Celestino, and Kyle Garlick in the most important series of the season, but injuries have taken away all of the Twins’ depth.</p>\n<p>The Twins have a young, controllable team that will compete for many years to come. They can bring back every single player on the 40-man roster outside of Carlos Correa, Michael Fulmer, and Gary Sanchez if they want to, and Correa has expressed a desire to stay in Minnesota if the Twins can meet his price tag.</p>\n<p>It may not feel like it in the midst of falling out of a playoff race, but baseball in Minnesota has a bright future. </p>\n<p>Also, the Vikings beat the Packers so there’s still some good in the world.</p>\n<p>STUDS:</p>\n\nNick Gordon, continuing his breakout campaign: 2-3, 2B, R, BB\nJustin Jefferson: 9 catches, 184 yards, 2 TDs\nKirk Cousins: 23-32, 277 yards, 2 TDs, 5-3-1 in his career against Aaron Rodgers\n\n<p>DUDS:</p>\n\nJorge López: yikes\nListen, let’s just appreciate the Vikings win",

        "description": "<p>Democratic candidate Katie Hobbs announced Sunday that she will not debate her GOP opponent in the race to become Arizona's next governor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Unfortunately, debating a conspiracy theorist like Kari Lake – whose entire campaign platform is to cause enormous chaos and make Arizona the subject of national ridicule – would only lead to constant interruptions, pointless distractions, and childish name-calling,\" Nicole DeMont, the campaign manager for Hobbs, said in a statement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Arizonans deserve so much better than Kari Lake, and that’s why we’re confident Katie Hobbs will be elected our next governor.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, the Democratic nominee will participate in a town-hall style event in which the candidates are questioned separately, the statement said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hobbs campaign was responding to the Citizens Clean Elections Commission, a state commission that monitors and organizes debates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The commission last week rejected a request from Hobbs to do separate, televised town hall events and gave the candidates seven days to come to an agreement for the Oct. 12 debate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hobbs' decision on Sunday likely kills any chance of a debate before the November election, which is projected as a tossup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hobbs, Arizona's secretary of state, has frequently lambasted Lake for repeating former President Trump's false claims the 2020 election was stolen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hobbs campaign has pointed to a June GOP primary debate, in which Lake said the 2020 election was rigged and that Democrats would cheat in the upcoming election, as evidence that any debate would be a mess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Hobbs' refusal to debate could bolster Lake's claims her opponent is afraid of confrontation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lake, a former television news anchor, said last week she would take the stage to herself on Oct. 12 if Hobbs does not show up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"It's becoming clearer everyday that Hobbs' strategy is to hide from Me, the Press, and the Voters throughout the entirety of this campaign and run out the clock on the people of Arizona,\" Lake tweeted.</p>",

        "description": "<p>When Queen Elizabeth took the throne at the tender age of 25, the sun was only just beginning to set on the British Empire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, as she is laid to rest, the monarchy’s dominion is less vast and the allegiance of her subjects more voluntary — but it is still globe-spanning. At her death, Queen Elizabeth was the head of state in 15 countries and the ceremonial head of the much wider Commonwealth, presiding over 2.5 billion people from Canada to Australia, Jamaica to Ghana, Pakistan to Fiji.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as her septuagenarian son King Charles III takes over, the prospects for holding together this vast realm look grim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The colonies over which the House of Windsor once ruled are now the Commonwealth, a loose collection of 56 member states that occasionally benefit from the British state. But many are restless, and the loyalty and respect that their governments pledged toward Elizabeth will be tested by a new monarch who is more political and less regal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The reason why so many countries have remained within the group [is that] they didn’t want to offend her,” said Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute with a specialty in the United Kingdom. “Countries have stayed on, remained with the status of having her as head of state much longer than they would have because they felt so much loyalty to her personally.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take Australia, which has for decades rumbled with republican sentiment. Though a 1999 referendum on whether to replace the monarchy with a president was defeated, the newly elected Prime Minister Anthony Albanese this year appointed the country’s first minister to lead the transition to become a republic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the queen now gone and replaced by the far less adored King Charles III, Republicans in Australia are readying for a replay of the referendum. However, that’s unlikely to happen in the short term, as Albanese pledged in his election campaign earlier this year that he would not hold a referendum on a republic until his second term in office — assuming he wins one — likely putting a vote four to five years away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before that, Aussies will be balloted on a more urgent question: In its first term, the Albanese government promised to hold a referendum on the “voice to parliament” — a body to be enshrined in the Australian constitution that would enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to provide advice to the parliament and government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In neighboring New Zealand, a recent poll found that the majority favor keeping ties to the monarchy even after the queen’s death, though Prime Minister Jacinda Arden acknowledged that New Zealand would likely move to become a republic “within my lifetime.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid tribute to the queen on Thursday as “one of my favorite people in the world,” but his nation doesn’t have the same affection for her son. A 2021 poll from the non-profit Angus Reid Institute found that only 34 percent of respondents would support King Charles remaining head of state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Republican trend is moving in only one direction; it’s just a matter or when. Barbados became a republic in 2021, and Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness announced his country would also seek to “become an independent” nation during the visit of the queen’s grandson Prince William earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mourning period — and widespread affection — for the queen will put a temporary freeze on efforts to cut the cord.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom Freda, the national director of Citizens for a Canadian Republic, declined to comment on next steps until after the queen’s state funeral in just over a week, though the organization put out a statement noting that the queen was “on record as having sympathy” for republican sentiments. Campaign group New Zealand Republic took a similar stance, expressing “condolences” for the royal family in a statement, and declining to make any further public comment until after the funeral.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the honeymoon for King Charles will be short, and he will soon have to cement his rule and win the affection his mother won over seven decades. There are some positive signs, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Commonwealth has a waiting list to join that includes South Sudan and Suriname, both former British colonies. The process to join the voluntary association can take years, and includes being willing to acknowledge the king as the ceremonial head of the organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critics argue that it’s hard to see the value: The group’s operations and funding for programs around the world are funded by member states, and the United Kingdom in 2020 contributed just £5 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Commonwealth is a community of like-minded nations, countries that used to be part of the British Empire,” Braw said. “It’s really a community of friendships between nations … the only material benefit is being asked to compete in the Commonwealth Games.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a group about which the queen was passionate, pledging to give her “heart and soul every day of life” to the Commonwealth in a 1953 speech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You cannot exaggerate enough the importance of the Queen to the Commonwealth, she has made it her life’s work to support the Commonwealth,” said Sue Onslow, director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London. “She has been the international organization’s absolutely devoted champion.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commonwealth Secretary General Patricia Scotland paid tribute to the queen on Thursday, noting that the queen had only missed one annual Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting between 1971 and 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The growth and vibrancy of our modern Commonwealth is a credit to her and testament to her dedication, wisdom and leadership,” Scotland said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>King Charles becoming her successor as the ceremonial head of the Commonwealth was not automatic, however. Leaders of Commonwealth countries formally acknowledged him as heir in 2018, following the queen expressing her “sincere wish” this would occur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charles might have more success in leading the Commonwealth than in staving off republican movements, though he faces ongoing pressure to address the dark legacy of the slave trade in many former colonies. The king made a speech in Rwanda earlier this year during the most recent Commonwealth meeting in which he said that the “time has come” to discuss the impact of slavery and expressed “sorrow” over the practice but stopped short of a formal apology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He says that this needs to be an open and honest discussion, and the time is now,” Onslow said. “These are very important issues within Commonwealth countries … particularly within Caribbean member countries.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On other issues key to the Commonwealth, the king has been a more vocal champion, particularly on environment sustainability, a subject which he’s been passionate about for nearly five decades. But as king, he will likely tone down his rhetoric as part of his new position, with the aim of following in the queen’s footsteps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Charles will be another royal diplomat,” Onslow said. But time will tell whether his far-flung dominions are ready to accept a new face in the same crown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zoya Sheftalovich contributed to this report.</p>",

        "description": "<p>BERLIN — Ukraine is defending Europe’s security in its battle with Russia, German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said, expressing “hope” that Kyiv’s latest military successes might accelerate an end to the war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking to POLITICO in an interview at the German Defense Ministry, the politician from Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) vowed to continue military support for Kyiv against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion “for as long as it takes.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also argued that Germany must learn from mistakes in past years and adopt a national security strategy that puts more emphasis on military needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interview came before Lambrecht is due to deliver a keynote speech on Germany’s upcoming national security strategy on Monday morning in Berlin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our values, democracy, freedom and security are being defended in Ukraine, because we see that President Putin has a strategy to spread fear and also to threaten that he could go further,” Lambrecht said, acknowledging that this has direct implications for the EU and the NATO military alliance and these implications must also be realized in Western Europe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When I talk to my colleagues on the eastern flank, I sense that they are reacting differently to this aggression and war than we are in Berlin and Paris,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lambrecht’s words are remarkably frank for a senior politician from the German Social Democrats: The SPD performed a historic shift on military aid for Ukraine at the outbreak of Russia’s war in February, but the party has been less direct so far when it comes to drawing a link between Kyiv’s fight against the Russian invasion and the security interests of Germany or the West.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, the remarks evoke the famous saying of former Defense Minister Peter Struck, who defended Berlin’s military engagement in Afghanistan in 2002 by saying that Germany’s security is “also being defended at the Hindu Kush.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lambrecht’s comments also highlight the long way she has come on military aid for Ukraine, after she was widely mocked in January for touting the delivery of 5,000 helmets to Kyiv as “a very clear signal” of support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 57-year-old politician spoke just as Ukrainian troops were starting to make unexpectedly rapid gains in a counteroffensive to the east of the city of Kharkiv, causing Russian forces to retreat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lambrecht said “Ukraine’s recent successes give me hope” that Russia might be forced to end its war, adding: “We are very impressed by how bravely the Ukrainians are fighting.” She stressed that “it is clear that we will support Ukraine for as long as it takes, even if this war lasts for weeks or months.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Berlin ramped up military supplies to Kyiv ahead of the summer, notably by delivering anti-aircraft tanks and howitzers and promising high-tech air defense missiles. Lambrecht said Germany is training Ukrainian soldiers for de-mining operations, and that Berlin is engaged in “very concrete” talks with Warsaw to set up a maintenance center in eastern Poland to be able to quickly repair delivered weapons such as howitzers if needed.</p>\n\n\n\nLambrecht said Germany is training Ukrainian soldiers for de-mining operations | Christopher Furlong/Getty Images \n\n\n\n<p>However, Lambrecht’s remarks stand in stark contrast to the fact that she has ruled out further significant deliveries of heavy weapons to Ukraine, arguing that the stocks of Germany’s armed forces, the Bundeswehr, are depleted and that Berlin must hold back weapons to ensure its own defense capabilities as well as obligations within NATO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If Lambrecht — quite correctly — concludes that our security is being defended in Ukraine, then it is also important that she and Chancellor Scholz credibly back this up with appropriate deliveries of armored vehicles to Ukraine,” said Roderich Kiesewetter, a defense policy lawmaker from Germany’s main opposition party, the center-right CDU. </p>\n\n\n\n‘Irresponsible saving’\n\n\n\n<p>While Scholz and Lambrecht stress that Berlin will not deliver heavy battle tanks like the Leopard, or infantry fighting vehicles like the Marder — arguing that no other ally including the U.S. is sending such Western tanks to Ukraine — critics like Kiesewetter argue Lambrecht could immediately supply Kyiv with lighter armored vehicles such as the Dingo or Fuchs, which would provide Ukrainian soldiers much-needed protection as they advance against Russian troops in the east and south. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>France already sent “a significant amount” of such armored vehicles to Ukraine. Yet in the interview, Lambrecht argued she had sworn an oath to ensure Germany’s defense capabilities at all times. Moreover, she blamed frugal defense budget policies of previous governments, arguing that many of the vehicles her military possesses on paper are not operational in reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I would very much like to be able to give significantly more to Ukraine,” she said. “If the Bundeswehr had not been so cut up in the years before, that would have been possible. But this is now the consequence of this irresponsible saving.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet Lambrecht’s criticism cuts both ways, since she served in the previous German government — first as parliamentary state secretary in the finance ministry and later as minister for justice and also family affairs. While her direct influence on the defense budget might have been limited in those jobs, it was Scholz who oversaw budget matters as vice chancellor and finance minister from 2018 to 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lambrecht stressed that Scholz had initiated “moderate” increases in defense spending during those years but acknowledged that this hadn’t been sufficient. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We were used to peace for a long time,” she said. “But since 2014 at the latest, since the Russian invasion of Crimea, it has been clear that we need to focus more on national and alliance defense … This is something that has been neglected — even though we saw this aggression in 2014. For a long time, we didn’t realize that we as the Bundeswehr were not as prepared as we should have been.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scholz promoted Lambrecht to the job of defense minister when he formed his new government last December, but the choice was questioned from the beginning given her limited expertise on defense matters amid the tense geopolitical context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Criticism of Lambrecht only increased after her much-derided helmets statement. And when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February, the minister found herself in the firing line as the German government was lambasted internationally for its hesitant military support. Media reports portrayed her as the “zero-interest minister” and it emerged that she had taken her adult son with her on a government helicopter for a holiday trip, triggering calls from the opposition that she should resign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lambrecht withstood the criticism and marched on, also thanks to support from Scholz. And in the interview with POLITICO on Friday, she sought to not only portray military expertise but also emphasized her ambitions to upgrade the chronically under-financed and under-equipped Bundeswehr with the giant €100 billion special fund that the government adopted ahead of the summer break. </p>\n\n\n\nLambrecht also took a swipe at one of her predecessors as defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen | Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP via Getty Images \n\n\n\n<p>She also vowed to tackle the Bundeswehr’s bureaucratic and often inefficient procurement system. “Here in the ministry, every stone is being turned over in terms of regulations in procurement so that we can become even faster,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lambrecht also took a swipe at one of her predecessors as defense minister — the CDU’s Ursula von der Leyen, now European Commission president — who had faced strong criticism and even a parliamentary investigation over dubious contracts with high-paid consultants during her tenure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Of course, something needs to be reformed in the procurement system. But I don’t need to bring in expensive consultants to do that,” Lambrecht said. “We can do that very well ourselves with our in-house expertise.”</p>\n\n\n\nNo more German vetoes \n\n\n\n<p>Lambrecht argued that the epochal Zeitenwende shift on defense and security policy that Scholz announced in February also meant that “we must be prepared to stand up for our values even by military means.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This included a sustained commitment to the NATO goal of spending 2 percent of national economic output. “We must be aware that this costs money,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lambrecht also spoke out in favor of more joint arms-development projects with EU partners, but stressed that Berlin must be willing to drop its veto right when it comes to selling those weapons to third countries — a demand that is likely to clash with Economy Minister Robert Habeck from the Green party, whose ministry oversees export authorizations and has vowed to enforce a stricter line on weapon deals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Germany’s ‘veto’ right in such projects must be questioned and adjusted,” Lambrecht said. “It’s not about us delivering to some rogue state. But if I’m doing such a project together with my allies, who share the same values as I do, and if I’m the only country there that has a different position on an export, then you have to ask yourself whether that can actually be the obstacle.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With respect to China, Lambrecht said it was important that Germany’s new national security strategy, which is planned for early next year, addresses Beijing’s role in global security and ensures companies don’t become vulnerable due to too much dependence on trade with China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It is important that the German government not only has an internal assessment of China, but also represents it publicly — and makes clear what it expects, what it intends to do,” she said. “And I can’t imagine any sensible company simply ignoring this.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This article is part of POLITICO Pro</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The one-stop-shop solution for policy professionals fusing the depth of POLITICO journalism with the power of technology</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Exclusive, breaking scoops and insights</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Customized policy intelligence platform</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A high-level public affairs network</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY GO PRO\n\n\n\nLOG IN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>",
