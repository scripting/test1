        "description": "Former President Donald Trump held a rally on Saturday night in Wilkes-Barre, Penn. in support of Republican Senate candidate Mehmet Oz and gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, where he slammed the FBI in his first public speech after the agency’s search of his Mar-a-Lago home.\n\n\n\n“The FBI and the Justice Department have become vicious monsters, controlled by radical left scoundrels, lawyers and the media, who tell them what to do,” said Trump in reference to the search that took place last month.\n\n\n\nThe warrant that justified the FBI’s search, released in with redactions last week following a court battle, found evidence that classified documents might be illegally stored at Trump’s home despite an order for him to return them after he left office.\n\n\n\n“The shameful raid and break-in of my home in Mar-a-Lago was a travesty of justice that made a mockery of America’s laws, traditions and principles,” Trump said at the rally, calling it “one of the most shocking abuses of power by any administration in American history.”\n\n\n\nTrump also criticized President Joe Biden’s speech on Thursday in Philadelphia, Penn., rejecting Biden’s claim that Trump is \"a clear and present danger\" to the country and calling Biden “the enemy of the state.”\n\n\n\n“As you know, this week Joe Biden came to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to give the most vicious, hateful and divisive speech ever delivered by an American president, vilifying 75 million citizens plus another probably 75-150 if we want to be accurate about it, as threats to democracy and as enemies of the state,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe rally, with attendees including Republican figures Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Maryland gubernatorial candidate Dan Cox and Johnson &amp; Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky, featured comments by Oz and Mastriano.\n\n\n\nOz criticized the Biden administration’s response to COVID-19, saying that “we saw ideas crushed” during the pandemic.\n\n\n\n“We saw science weaponised,” he continued.\n\n\n\nMastriano expressed similar discontentment with Biden and his allies.\n\n\n\n“The Democrats are trying to distract us with their dirty stinking laundry list of bad ideas,” he claimed.\n\n\n\n“We the people are pissed, I know I am.”",

        "description": "Phillies outfielder Nick Castellanos left last night&#8217;s game and wasn&#8217;t in today&#8217;s lineup due to an issue with his right oblique. He is headed for an MRI but manager Rob Thomson is hopeful that this is just precautionary (Twitter links from Scott Lauber of the Philadelphia Inquirer.)\nSigned in the offseason to a five-year, $100MM contract, the first few months of his tenure in Philly didn&#8217;t go so well, though he had turned things around over the past month. Through the end of July, he was hitting just .257/.300/.373 but has hit .294/.327/.490 since the calendar flipped to August. That progress seems to have now hit a couple of snags, as he already missed a few games earlier this week due to turf toe, with this oblique issue now added into the mix.\nCastellanos has yet to be placed on the injured list, but losing his hot bat for even a few games will be a setback for the club. The Phillies are currently holding onto the final Wild Card spot in the National League, with the Brewers just three games back. With Bryce Harper unable to throw and taking the designated hitter spot every day, Castellanos will likely have a tough time getting back into the lineup until he feels well enough to play a full game. The Phillies used an outfield of Kyle Schwarber, Brandon Marsh and Matt Vierling tonight, with that trio likely to be the regulars until Castellanos can return. Nick Maton is primarily an infielder but has four left field starts in his career and might be the fourth outfielder for now.\nOther injury updates from around the league&#8230;\n\nAngels righty Michael Lorenzen, who has been on the IL since July 7 due to a shoulder strain, has been on a rehab stint but will make his next start with the big league club. J.P. Hoornstra of the Southern California News Group relays the news from interim manager Phil Nevin. That will give Lorenzen a few weeks to showcase his abilities before heading back to free agency this winter. Long used as a reliever by the Reds, he signed with the Angels when they agreed to let him try himself out as a starter. He had a 3.45 ERA through mid-June, having made ten starts. Unfortunately, he allowed 16 earned runs over his next three, ballooning his ERA 4.94. The righty will get a chance to wash away that latter section as an injury blip and finish strong before returning to the open market. The Angels will need to open a spot on the 40-man roster for him, as he is currently on the 60-day IL.\nRed Sox lefty Josh Taylor, who has been on the IL all year due to a low back strain, will not return over the final few weeks of the campaign. Pete Abraham of the Boston Globe relays word from the club that it will go down as a completely lost season for the 29-year-old. It&#8217;s an unfortunate development for both Taylor and the club as he had a very nice season in 2021. Last year, he threw 47 2/3 innings with a 3.40 ERA, 28.7% strikeout rate and 43.4% ground ball rate. His 11% walk rate was a bit above the 9.8% league average for relievers last year, but it was still a strong enough showing that the club gave him the chance to earn 15 holds on the year. Taylor qualified for arbitration the first time this year as a Super Two player and is making $1.025MM for the season. Based on not appearing this season, he could likely be retained by the Red Sox at a similar price for next season, if they expect he can return to health and recapture his previous form.",

The home run came in Turner’s first at-bat after sitting Friday, his first non-start of the season.\nSaturday marked the 52nd time in 55 games Betts and Turner have batted 1-2 in the Dodgers lineup. They were linked in another way in this one, with Betts starting at second base for the third time this year. The middle infield mates made a nifty play up the middle, when Betts fielded a ball with his momentum going toward third base, then shoveled to Turner on his way to second base for a force out.\n\n\nThat Mookie and Trea connection. pic.twitter.com/DZCdrVi5kc— Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThat play helped stay out of the big inning after the first two batters reached. Julio Urías did the heavy lifting, inducing a Juan Soto pop out and a Manny Machado fly out to end the threat.\nUrías kept his stingy streak going, allowing just one run in six innings, working around three walks. He allowed only two hits, the last of which was a solo home run by Machado in the sixth. Urías has allowed one run or fewer in six straight starts and eight of his last nine, lowering his National League-leading ERA to 2.29.\nThe support kept coming against Manaea. After a pair of singles in the fourth inning, Betts launched a three-run homer with two outs to break the game open. Betts’ 33rd home run of the season set a new career high, and matched Joc Pederson’s Dodgers record for most home runs hit out of the leadoff spot, set in 2019.\nJustin Turner got Manaea in the fifth inning for a two-run home run, Turner’s eighth extra-base hit in his last nine games.\nThree times this season the Dodgers have faced Manaea, and three times they have tattooed him. The Padres left-hander allowed eight runs in 4⅓ innings in this one, running his post-All-Star-break ERA to 8.36 in eight starts.\n\nManaea against the Dodgers this year has allowed 22 runs (22 earned) on 24 hits in 12⅔ innings. His 15.63 ERA is the fourth-highest by any pitcher against the Dodgers in a season, with at least three starts, trailing only Burleigh Grimes (28.59 in 1931), Ron Bryant (17.18, 1974), and Lefty Weinert (15.75, 1923).\nThe Dodgers and Padres meet in two more series later in September, so Manaea still has time to improve on that, if he stays in the rotation for a San Diego team still fighting to secure a wild card berth.\nManaea’s exit did not stop the scoring. Will Smith, who doubled home Freddie Freeman in the third innings, hit a three-run home run off Reiss Knehr. Smith was the designated hitter, which left catching duties to Austin Barnes, who doubled, singled, and scored twice. Barnes has reached base in six straight starts and eight of his last nine, hitting .355/.441/.613 (11-for-31) since the beginning of August.\nBlake Treinen had the softest landing possible for his first major league game in 4½ months, entering the seventh with an 11-run advantage. The right-hander needed only five pitches for a perfect frame, inducing two groundouts and a flyout.\nHanser Alberto pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to finish off the blowout, his eight pitching appearance of the season, and second in a row. He got Josh Bell looking for the second out of the inning, and his first major league strikeout.\nSaturday particulars\nHome runs: Trea Turner (19), Mookie Betts (33), Will Smith (20); Manny Machado (26)\nWP — Julio Urías (15-7): 6 IP, 2 hits, 1 run, 3 walks, 2 strikeouts\nLP — Sean Manaea (7-8): 4⅓ IP, 9 hits, 8 runs, 1 walk, 4 strikeouts\nUp next\nRyan Pepiot will be called up to pitch the series finale Sunday evening (4:08 p.m., ESPN), but since he hasn’t yet spent 15 days on optional assignment, he’ll have to replace a player going on the injured list. That’ll be David Price, manager Dave Roberts told reporters after the game.\n\n\n#Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said David Price will go on the injured list with a left wrist issue. He’ll be the move for Ryan Pepiot, who will be the bulk guy. Caleb Ferguson will be the opener on Sunday.— Juan Toribio (@juanctoribio) September 4, 2022",

Until now, sources within the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) have kept their counsel over the scandal since it was revealed last week that the Metropolitan police in London allegedly knew that a people smuggler linked to western security services trafficked the then 15-year-old.

Barely out of the last acute crisis of the pandemic, the next is already upon them. Headteachers have been spending the summer recasting budgets, trying to work out what can be cut in order to make space for rocketing energy bills and higher wages without having a detrimental impact on their pupils. But they are not financial magicians and one of the myriad ways in which the cost of living crisis will harm children will be through its impact on their education.Schools have faced tough times in recent years. Per-pupil funding fell by 9% between 2010 and 2020, what the Institute for Fiscal Studies describes as the largest cut to school funding in more than 40 years. Schools serving the poorest communities suffered the worst: they saw a drop of 14% in per-pupil funding in real terms. Since 2020, the government has increased funding but it is still slightly lower than in 2010 and, again, schools in the poorest areas have been awarded just over half the increase of those in the most affluent areas.

        "description": "Posted: Sept. 3 | Updated: Sept. 4, 4:45 p.m.At least one shot rang out in the crowd gathered at the Mighty Midway entrance at the Minnesota State Fair on Saturday – sending fairgoers running for safety and leaving at least one person hurt. The fair closed and started sending fairgoers home minutes later, more than an hour before its scheduled shut down. The incident happened just after 10 p.m., and a video camera streaming from the KSTP broadcast center nearby showed scores of people suddenly turning and running away from the intersection of Liggett Street and Carnes Avenue. Footage from KSTP-TV shows people fleeing from the entrance of the Minnesota State Fair midway, following what officials said was a shooting incident there just after 10 p.m. on Saturday.KSTP-TV ScreengrabFair officials said there had been a large contingent of police officers in the area, who heard the gunfire. Officers later found someone with what was described as a non-life-threatening injury. The person was treated at Regions Hospital in St. Paul. In a Sunday morning news conference, the State Fair police chief said his department had “requested and received additional law enforcement resources” earlier on Saturday after a large group of young people started causing fights and disturbances at the fair. He and other state officials believe the additional police presence kept the situation contained. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what else could have been done,” said Ron Knafla, chief of the Minnesota State Fair Police Department. “For somebody to engage in such a brazen act in a crowd of people, with no regard for the safety or the lives of others, is just disgusting in my opinion.&quot;Earlier, thousands of people filled the fair’s streets and concessions on the cool, clear evening.  About an hour before the incident occurred law enforcement officers were gathered at the head of the Midway, where many of the fair’s rides are located. The shooting comes despite metal detectors at the fair gates, although some fairgoers have reported only cursory examinations of bags and other belongings after fairgoers set off the magnetometers. Videos posted to social media also show people scaling the fair’s perimeter fence on Saturday night, away from the official fair entrances and metal detectors. Last night’s incident follows a 2019 shooting that injured three people and preceded a serious vehicle-pedestrian crash at the fair’s main gate on Snelling Avenue on the last day of the State Fair in 2019. It also follows a surge of gun violence in the Twin Cities, including two recent shooting incidents at the Mall of America. Gov. Tim Walz and state public safety commissioner John Harrington had joined State Fair Police Chief Ron Knafla just hours before the fair opened to assure fairgoers about the safety of the event. On Sunday, Walz said despite this high-profile incident, it’s believed there have been fewer incidents in general over the course of this year’s fair. He said it’s a sign that the updated security plans, including added partnerships to call in extra law enforcement personnel when needed, have largely been successful. “I think what you’re hearing from these folks is the plan operated,” Walz said. “There’s always the assumption is something could have been done. My question is three dozen officers within several feet of this happening and it still happened? And I don’t know in a free society … at what point that is.”At the entrance to the Midway, there was only a scrap of police tape left on a pole as of 9 a.m. Sunday. A fair worker came by a short time later to rip it off.A small piece of police tape early Sunday morning was the only visible sign of the previous night&#x27;s disturbance at the Minnesota State Fair Saturday night. One person had non-life-threatening injuries after being shot. Brian Bakst | MPRLines were long outside security to enter the fairgrounds. People walked through metal detectors. Those who made the machines beep were pulled aside to empty pockets or let security personnel look through bags. Not all people with bags had them inspected.A state trooper and other uniformed law enforcement stood watch from a distance.“Fair, fair, fair,” one couple chanted as they made it through the gates.“Welcome to the fair,” bellowed a volunteer every few minutes.This is a developing news story.

Might I consider reviewing the restaurant that he and Ellis Barrie had opened in 2020? Not only might I consider it: I had considered it feverishly, multiple times, and with good reason. The Barrie brothers have a great story. As very young men they turned a small café, by a remote mobile home park in Anglesey, into what quickly became a point of gastronomic pilgrimage. The Marram Grass was reputedly a place that took North Wales’s finest ingredients and turned them into edible wonders. Now they had moved to the city and taken over a space in the redbrick mercantile palace which is Albert Dock for Lerpwl, the Welsh for Liverpool. Continue reading...",

        "description": "We all like our tried and trusted favourites, but there’s a world full of wine varieties out there to tryBarco del Corneta Cucú Verdejo, Castilla y León, Spain 2021 (£18, thesourcingtable.com) According to Wine Grapes, Jancis Robinson, Julia Harding and José Vouillamoz’s definitive reference work on the subject, some 1,368 vine varieties are used to make wine in the world. And yet, most of us, it would seem, limit our drinking to a bare handful, rarely straying from our tried and trusted favourites, most of which, with the exception of Italian pinot grigio (or, if we’re drinking something with bubbles, prosecco’s glera), are French in origin. Nothing wrong with that, and, given that the grape variety itself is but one of several influential variables that shape a wine’s character, you could limit your drinking to one or two of the more protean varieties (chardonnay and syrah/shiraz, say) and never get bored. In the back to school spirit of attempting a fresh start, however, any of you who might be looking for something to ease you away from sauvignon blanc could do worse than trying Barca del Corneta’s similarly vibrant, exceptionally bright-fruited and enlivening verdejo.Les Andides Saumur Blanc, France 2020, (£9.99, Waitrose) Other sauvignon alternatives, which also have the advantage of being among the best value white wines around, are the pungently green but cool-mountain-stream crisp and racy whites from Gascon, southwest France. Made from armagnac’s colombard, Pujalet Côtes de Gascogne 2021 (£6.29, Waitrose) is all lemony zip and gooseberryish tang, while Tesco finest St-Mont 2019 (£7, Tesco) is mostly made of the great gros manseng bringing a more tropical lilt (or Lilt) to the bracing mix. If you’re stuck on chardonnay, on the other hand, my tip for varying your vinous diet would be to make your way through the fantastically varied world of chenin blanc. At its best in the Loire and South Africa, chenin can be bristlingly zippy with fresh gren apple fruit in unoaked examples such as Les Andides from Saumur or the more tropical Zalze Bush Vine Chenin Blanc 2021 (from £6.45, Waitrose, Asda, Morrisons). But like chardonnay, it also works very well with oak, in toasty, honeyed, but satisfyingly clean-cut wines such as Stellenrust Stellenbosch Manor Barrel Fermented Chenin Blanc 2020 (£14, Tesco).

        "description": "Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Luis Garcia’s heroics weren’t enough to lift Houston on Saturday night.  The Houston Astros dropped a 2-1, 12-inning affair on the road with 38,244 in the house at Angel Stadium.\nEarly in the afternoon, I was doing a little bit of statistical scouting in preparation for tonight’s recap. Imagine my surprise when I initially saw that Houston was an even pick over the Angels, at 50-50. A cursory glance showed why: \nShohei Ohtani (11-8, 2.67) got the start against the Astros, his fourth this season. Although he’s been pretty good this season against Houston, coming in he’s a relatively pedestrian 2-3 with a 4.21 ERA over his five-season career vs. our boys. Luis Garcia (11-8, 4.14) would be defending the Astros’ honor from the hill. He would do pretty well.\nAlso of statistical note was Houston’s chance to make .500 as a franchise. With a victory, they would boast a 4,811-4,811 record. It wouldn’t be the first time, believe it or not. They started off as the Houston Colt .45’s with a 6-5 record before falling (eventually) nearly 200 games below the watermark. They recovered to clear the .500 mark in 2005, eventually closing the 2008 campaign at 3,748-3,747 before the wheels came off for several seasons. \nGarcia surrendered a pair of doubles to David Fletcher, and Ohtani kept Houston off the bath paths completely until Yuli Gurriel hit a seeing-eye single to the right side with one out in the fourth inning. Otherwise, there were no other baserunners until the fifth. \nTrey Mancini doubled off the right-center wall with a pair of outs in the fifth off Ohtani, marking the first Astro in scoring position. He came home a moment later on a J.J. Matijevic single to give Houston a 1-0 lead. \n\n\nClutch. pic.twitter.com/I2npigZgMW— Houston Astros (@astros) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nHouston mounted a further threat in the sixth, loading the bases on Ohtani with a pair of singles and either a hit batsman or a questionable catcher’s interference call. Gameday says HBP, so we go with that. Unfortunately, with two outs already, Christian Vazquez flew out to right field to end the rally before it started. \nAfter six very good frames, Garcia started to crack in the seventh, giving up a single to Luis Rengifo and a walk to Taylor Ward before collecting an out. A pair of sac flies moved the runners from first and second to Rengifo in and Ward on third to tie the score at one for Max Stassi. Stassi flew out harmlessly, ending Garcia’s night. \nIn the eighth, Altuve hit a one-out double up the right-field line. It was one pitch after Ohtani put a 100.2 MPH sinker over the inside corner that probably should have been strike three. Altuve was stranded at second base after Gurriel and Alex Bregman each flew out.\nAfter the ninth inning would see the two clubs combine for zero baserunners, the 10th opened with Mauricio Dubon on second, pinch-running for Mancini. David Hensley pinched in for Matijevic and struck out on three pitches. With two out, Jeremy Peña reached first on an infield single, moving Dubon to third, but Altuve couldn’t plate Dubon, grounding into a fielders choice to end the frame. \nAfter Neris got through his half of the 10th, Altuve opened the 11th as the phantom runner. Gurriel grounded out to the pitcher, failing to move Altuve. Altuve then stole third, and Bregman struck out. Vazquez lined out to left to end the inning, giving the Angels a third shot at the walk-off. \nPhil Maton came in to pitch the 11th inning and try to give Houston another chance, and aside from an intentional walk to Ohtani, got through the frame unscathed. \nOn to the 12th, phantom runner Vazquez took third on a Rengifo throwing error, which also allowed Dubon to reach with nobody out. With runners on the corners, and nobody out....Hensley grounded into a double play and Vazquez failed to score. Vazquez was then stranded on third. \nAnaheim’s half of the 12th ended with two outs when Matt Duffy singled home ghost runner Taylor Ward with the game-winner. \n  \n        \n  \nBOX SCORE\nJust a Few Things\n\nThe in-game microphones were doing a good job of picking up crowd chatter whenever Altuve came to the dish, a little too good. I was getting uncomfortable hearing the hateful spew of degenerate Angels fans, who I thought were better than that. I thought Californians were more evolved? Guess not.\nOhtani was nearly the second Angels hitter to hit safely in the game with a two-out single in the bottom of the sixth. Wisely, however, the Astros elected to review the play. The two-way star was out by a hair. \nGarcia struck out seven over as many innings, giving up only three hits, two walks, and one earned run to drop his ERA to 3.99. His 72 GameScore is his second best mark of the season after his 74 on May 6, in a 3-2 win over Detroit. He left with a tie score in this one, and a chance at victory. He earned no decision instead, putting 61-of-94 pitches over the plate.\nOhtani’s “new” pitch is just unfair on top of everything else. It’s damn filthy. He threw 111 pitches on a 95° night, plating 80 of them, striking out five, walking nobody, and surrendering one run on six hits. His GameScore was 71. This guy, amirite?\n\nRyne Stanek pitched a scoreless eighth. Despite walking Mike Trout with two outs, he then induced a Ohtani groundout to Gurriel, unassisted. \n\nJose Quijada worked a 1-2-3 ninth, striking out Kyle Tucker and Mancini. The Angels left him in for the 10th, which seems counterintuitive for a reliever after roster expansion in the Manfred-runner era. The gambit paid off when Quijada collected two more outs before getting relieved by Jimmy Herget.\n\nBryan Abreu came on to relieve Stanek, and even though every hitter got to a 3-2 count, he worked a 1-2-3 ninth of his own. \n\nHector Neris struck out Stassi with one out and the runner on third in the bottom half of the 10th, then extended the game to the 11th by getting Fletcher to fly out to right field. \nMan, Altuve really wanted to score in the 11th, but he couldn’t do it by himself. \n\nThanks for reading. We’ll try this again tomorrow.",

        "description": "A once dilapidated period home by the sea is now bursting with exotic murals and ornate furnishingsYou can tell someone’s heart and soul has gone into this busy but beautiful family home in Brighton. “I love collecting things, I love shopping and I love clutter,” says owner and designer Kate Powell. She admits these are some of the reasons she opened a shop, after running out of space at home. Upcycled, restored, reclaimed, inherited are all key to her distinctive style.Kate and her husband, Toby, bought the dilapidated listed Regency townhouse 10 years ago, with its “big, square imposing rooms, which are easy to make look beautiful”. The couple loved the area and proximity to the beach, plus the house rare find of a propertyhad a garden and drive. However, they hadn’t realised the enormity of the project, the house being “pretty grotty and in need of a complete overhaul. We got the survey and I almost had a nervous breakdown looking at it.” A team of builders moved in for a long eight months while the family remained at their old home round the corner, “a huge stretch financially”, so that everything from flooring to fireplaces could be restored. A basement flat was renovated and re-introduced to the main house, which now has five bedrooms and two bathrooms. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Taylor’s third career multi-homer game helps Milwaukee overcome another underwhelming start by Corbin Burnes Box Score\nTyrone Taylor fronted an offensive outburst that helped the Brewers defeat the Diamondbacks 8-6 in a comeback effort on Saturday night.\nTaylor went 3-for-5 with a double and two home runs, the second of which put the Brewers on top for good in the 10th inning.\nCorbin Burnes’ second-half struggles continued, as he allowed five runs (all earned) on seven hits and three walks with five strikeouts in 5 2⁄3 innings.\nThe Brewers’ offense did their best to support their struggling ace. After the Diamondbacks got on the board with a Corbin Carroll single in the first inning, the Brewers answered with a two-run double by Victor Caratini to take a 2-1 lead.\n\n\nCaratini takes care of business. Brewers take the lead.#ThisIsMyCrew pic.twitter.com/75vBfCzmni— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThis began the back-and-forth nature of the game. On three occasions, the Brewers staked Burnes to a lead only for him to give it up the following inning.\nIn the bottom of the second, he loaded the bases with one out, allowing Arizona to tie the game 2-2 on a sacrifice fly by Daulton Varsho.\nThe Brewers broke the tie in the top of the fifth. With runners on the corners, Keston Hiura hit a roller to second base that ate up Josh Rojas, allowing Willy Adames to score from third to make it a 3-2 game.\nThat lead quickly evaporated when Burnes allowed a solo home run to Varsho to tie the game at three.\nMilwaukee reclaimed the lead once again on Taylor’s first blast of the night, a solo shot to right field that made the score 4-3 Brewers.\n\n\nOppo for the lead! #ThisIsMyCrew pic.twitter.com/oFAYHm7b08— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nIt seemed as though Burnes was going to keep his team on top for good, recording the first two outs of the bottom of the sixth in order. That changed when a base hit by Alek Thomas and a double by former Brewers farmhand Cooper Hummel tied the game at four.\nThose hits knocked Burnes out of the game, and he was relieved by Brad Boxberger.\nThe damage did not cease, as Boxberger allowed consecutive singles to Geraldo Perdomo and Rojas to tack on two more runs and make it a 6-4 Arizona lead. He then fanned Varsho to end the frame.\nThe Brewers continued to chip away, adding a run in the eighth on a base hit to left field by Andrew McCutchen to drive in Jace Peterson.\nPeterson was initially ruled out at the plate, but a replay review confirmed that he was safe, and the call was overturned to make it 6-5.\nRowdy Tellez came off the bench to pinch-hit for Luis Urias in the ninth, and he smoked a 1-2 fastball from Ian Kennedy for a game-tying home run.\n\n\nROWDY BOMB TIES IT UP pic.twitter.com/AOdS6O55BI— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nIt was Tellez’s third game-tying blast in the ninth inning of a game since the start of August.\nA scoreless inning from Devin Williams sent the game to extra innings, where Taylor delivered his second home run of the night, a two-run shot in the tenth that made it 8-6 Brewers.\n\n\nHave a night, Tyrone! @tyrone_taylor15 | #ThisIsMyCrew pic.twitter.com/IdKRQYP5J2— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThat’s where the score held. Taylor Rogers flashed some added velocity in a perfect inning en route to his second save as a member of the Brewers.\nRogers has worked eight consecutive outings without allowing an earned run since a four-run meltdown against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 14.\nThe win inspires renewed hope for the Brewers in the Wild Card race.\nBoth the San Diego Padres and Philadelphia Phillies lost on Saturday, so the Brewers now sit 2.5 games out of the third Wild Card spot.\nIt is worth noting that because both the Phillies and Padres hold the tiebreaker over the Brewers, Milwaukee will need to finish ahead of them rather than tie, so they are effectively 3.5 games back.\nThe Brewers will look to salvage a series split with another win tomorrow, but they face a tough matchup in Diamondbacks right-hander Zac Gallen. Jason Alexander gets another start for the Brewers after a strong outing against the Pittsburgh Pirates last Tuesday.\nFirst pitch is scheduled for 3:10 p.m. CDT.",

        "description": "In his often moving second memoir, the comedian reflects on his unlikely journey from seaside summer seasons to award-winning elder statesman of TV – and why he feels he failed his motherLenny Henry has always received more than his fair share of criticism, from racists, whose opinion can be discounted, but also from liberal activist types decrying the regressive buffoonery of his early work and comedy fans who simply find him unfunny. In his uneven second autobiography, following Who Am I, Again? which covered his early life up to 1980, Henry accepts most of this judgment.“I failed upwards,” he writes in a startling epilogue, citing the Beckett fragment on creative futility. He acknowledges that it took more than 10 years for him to become halfway decent, and that he received more than his fair share of opportunities because of early television fame. “I couldn’t really sing or dance. I’d forget the middle bits of jokes. I’d fall over or knock props over (in front of Princess Anne!),” he writes. As one of our most successful comedians, it’s sobering how little he has felt it. “I kept going, because what was the alternative?” Continue reading...",

        "description": "The man who liberalised the Soviet Union died last week, beset by a sense that his country had been betrayed – by the west and historyThe German poet Hans Magnus Enzensberger labelled him “the hero of retreat”. But does retreat produce heroes? A lost man haunted by the death of his beloved wife and torn apart by a sense of guilt and anger for the tragic death of his beloved country. This is how Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union’s first and final president, vividly appears in Vitaly Mansky’s documentary Gorbachev. Heaven. This was also my experience several years ago when I visited Gorbachev in his foundation’s empty offices. This stark, poignant impression of Mikhail Sergeevich, who died last week at 91, will forever stay with me.I recall two other Gorbachevs. The first I saw on TV in my native Bulgaria in 1985. I was a 20-year-old studying philosophy at Sofia University and Gorbachev had just been elected general secretary of the Communist party of the Soviet Union. His arrival to power, not to mention his opening policy gambits, was as surprising as snow in July. The very fact that the Soviet nomenklatura elected somebody who was younger than 70 and able to finish a sentence was a miracle. Even more supernatural was the sense of an opening that he brought – an infectious feeling that something impossible only yesterday was possible today and that even more might happen tomorrow.

Written and directed by John Michael McDonagh, whose screen CV includes The Guard (2011), Calvary (2014) and War on Everyone (2016), it’s an anxiously moralist tale of crime and punishment, revenge and resolution, played out against a broad-strokes, culture-clash backdrop that brings a tang of spiteful satire to the deeper discussions of good and evil.“It’s a long way to go for a party, but then they’re more your friends than mine.” So says David (Ralph Fiennes), a British doctor with a blemished record whom we first meet aboard a boat to “l’Afrique” with his wife, Jo (Jessica Chastain, who co-starred with Fiennes in his 2011 Coriolanus). She’s an unproductive children’s author who has fallen from favour with her young readers – an audience she detests. He is a “highly functioning alcoholic”, a phrase he likens to a double negative, as if one cancels out the other. Continue reading...",

But some argue that Psy’s K-pop gateway drug was a novelty record and not a true expression of the precision-tooled, gendered group phenomenon that is K-Pop. Sonically, K-pop beats western pop at its own game, taking the busier, upbeat end of US R&amp;B and supercharging it, stuffing each track with multiple melodies, umpteen pre-choruses and, sometimes, a sprinkling of Korean tradition: TikTok was made for K-Pop, and it turns out Korean is a terrific language to rap in.

        "description": "The most popular palms in the world come from the tiny Lord Howe Island – and were the reason for the start of high-ceilinged atriumsLord Howe Island palms (aka Kentia palms) might be native to only a tiny speck in the South Pacific, just seven miles long and one mile wide, but their incredible beauty and resilience have made them not just one of the most popular houseplants on the planet, but a species that has changed the face of architecture.Ever since Victorian times, the Lord Howe islanders have climbed the trees to harvest their nuts and export them all over the world for the horticultural trade. While today this is strictly controlled for conservation reasons, wild-collected palm seeds for the houseplant business are still the island’s only real export. Every potted palm you see in garden centres across the world is grown painstakingly from seeds like these, taking years to mature. Continue reading...",

Or Zadie Smith, her fine intellect, sharp as a Japanese blade, undulled by scrolling (I think about her and her social media ban often). Zadie Smith does not need to know about memes.I know about memes, because while Zadie Smith was creating enduring art, I was blunting the cheap plastic-handled knife of my brain in the dishwasher of Twitter. I imagine its crenellations and folds softened into a grey blur from prolonged bathing in social media’s grim minestrone of outrage, dancing cockatoos, raw sewage footage and the kind of tragedy that should require us to step away and take time to grieve. But no, here are some dogs going down a slide! One day I’ll break free, but, until then, little sparks of intellectual stimulation, connection or fun – the stuff that sucked me in – compensate for no longer being able to concentrate for more than 90 seconds.

        "description": "Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The bullpen wound up wrecking this one, and once it goes to extras, we’re doomed. But given all that, it wasn’t so bad. So I drew another Bumgarner start tonight, which I wasn’t thrilled with. He was facing off tonight against Corbin Burnes, the top guy in Milwaukee’s rotation and last year’s NL Cy Young award winner. With that kind of matchup, it would be not only delusional but also willfully negligent to expect too many good things for our side. So I didn’t, and well, yes, we lost in the end, but honestly, but in terms of the good things for our side tonight, I wound up being pleasantly surprised for the most part. At least until the bullpen got involved.\nFirst good thing was that our very highly paid Bum retired the Brewers in order in the top of the first on only fifteen pitches. Given how well and how efficiently Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly have been pitching of late, “fifteen pitches” doesn’t fully rate an “only” in my mind, but we’re talking about the Bum here, so hell yes, I will take it and praise him for it.\nSecond good thing was that we scratched out a run in the bottom of the first to take the lead against the reigning CY Young guy. Josh Rojas led off for us, went up 3-0 on the first three pitches Burnes threw him (fair disclosure—despite the CY Young, Burnes has been kinda rough lately in terms of his control and also his results of late) before Burnes got back into it with a couple of strikes to get the count full. Rojas then did what he sometimes does, and dropped a bunt down, left of the mound, garnering a bunt-single infield hit on a full count in the first inning.\nGotta love the Rojas Special.\nShortly thereafter, Burnes threw away a pickoff, because Rojas making Burnes uncomfortable with his leads and his body language and whatnot, which is what he does, so he took second. Daulton Varsho, batting second tonight, got the count full himself and earned a walk. Ketel Marte and Christian Walker (earning more than $10 million between the two of them this year, tra la) followed with two unproductive outs, a foul-out to third by Marte and a fly to shallow center for Walker, before Corbin Carroll drove a single into shallow right to bring Rojas home. \n\n\nCorbin Carroll comes through (again). pic.twitter.com/Z6e9tLGWu0— Bally Sports Arizona (@BALLYSPORTSAZ) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Rivera struck out afterward to end the frame, but not only had we drawn first blood, we’d also hung 30 pitches on Burnes in his first inning, so that was nice too. 1-0 D-BACKS\nSadly, a 1-run lead after one was not enough to make Madison Bumgarner feel secure, and he promptly gave the run back, and another on top of it, in the top of the second. He surrendered a leadoff single to Brewers’ 2B Luis Urias to start things off, before getting esteury Ruiz to strike out looking for the first out. After that, though, he walked the next batter, got his second out on a fielder’s choice grounder to third, and then allowed Milwaukee catcher Victor Caratini to double into the corner in left to clear the bases. 2-1 Milwaukee\nOur kiddos, though, turned out to be equal to the task of getting us at least back to zero. Cooper Hummel, catching for us tonight like he does sometimes now, I guess, doubled to right to with one out in the bottom of the frame, and advanced to third on a Geraldo Perdomo single to shallow left. Josh Rojas walkedd, and Daulton Varsho hit a sacrifice fly to deep left that plated Hummel. Ketel Marte ended the inning, as he often does, this time by striking out looking, but at least we were all evened up again. 2-0 TIE\nThings got quiet after that, for awhile, as both Burnes and Bumgarner settled down for the next few innings, after their respective fashions. Burnes retired us in order in the third and the fourth; Bumgarner, meanwhile, tap-danced his way around various base hits, walks, hit batsmen and whatnot, to put up zeros in the third and the fourth, and to surrender an unearned run in the fifth, thanks to a two-out misplay by Rojas on an infield grounder that allowed a run to score. 3-2 Milwaukee\nBum wound up needing 95 pitches to get through those five frames, and so his night was done after 5 innings, but he ended with a deceptively good pitching line of 5 IP, 3 R, 2 ER, 6 H, 2 BB, and 3 K. That’s far better than we’ve come to expect from the Bum, and if you didn’t see the game you might well feel that he had a good start. Trust me, though....he did not pitch particularly well, and given how he did perform, the outcome for him could have easily been far, far worse. Just sayin’.\nAlso, if you’re keeping track at home, each of those five innings of the Bum’s work tonight cost the Diamondbacks $162,889.52, for a total of $814,447.59 for this evening’s work, based on his $23M salary and the 141.2 innings he’s managed to get through so far this year. So that’s fun.\nAnyway. Daulton Varsho hit his 19th dinger of the year, a one-out solo shot into the pool area, to get us back to even, again, in the bottom of the fifth. \n\n\nDaulton Varsho ties the game with one swing! pic.twitter.com/SmMCGLW5kR— Bally Sports Arizona (@BALLYSPORTSAZ) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThe kiddos continue to do their best to keep us in games. 3-3 TIE\nKenyon Middleton, making his return for us from the IL, gave the lead back again on the first pitch he threw in the top of the sixth, surrendering a homer to right center to Brewers’ CF Tyrone Taylor, but settled down after that to retire the next three batters he faced. 4-3 Milwaukee\nAgain, our young players, this time at the bottom of the order, kept fighting. After Corbin Carroll and Emmanuel Rivera made outs to begin the bottom of the sixth, Alek Thomas singled to left. Coopel Hummel then doubled off the wall in pretty much straightaway center, plating Thomas for the tying run. \n\n\nCoop comes through again! pic.twitter.com/1iT2PKLmtJ— Arizona Diamondbacks (@Dbacks) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nGeraldo Perdomo then notched his second hit of the night, a single to shallow left that scored Hummel. He then stole second base off of Burnes, who was still in the game for Milwaukee, and scored when Rojas singled to center. Varsho struck out to end the rally, but we’d actually put up a crooked number, and another lead. 6-4 D-BACKS\nKevin Ginkel pitched the top of the seventh for us, and despite some mild Ginkeling (a walk, a single, many more pitches and fuller counts than any of us were comfortable with), wound up putting up a zero. Our offense did the same in the bottom of the frame, though, sadly, so the score held until the top of the eighth, when we gave the first run of our lead back.\nCaleb Smith took the ball for us and induced three nice ground balls in a row. the first two went for outs; the third resulted in an infield hit by Brewers’ 3B and nine-hole hitter Jace Pederson, who beat out a slow grounder. That earned Smith the hook, and he was replaced by Reyes Moronta. Moronta threw a wild pitch that advanced Pederson to second, and then Milwaukee DH and leadoff hitter Andrew McCutchen singled to left, driving Pederson in. 6-5 D-BACKS\nDespite a two-out walk by Perdomo, we did nothing in the bottom half, bringing us to the top of the ninth, clinging to a one-run lead and Ian P. Kennedy taking the mound. IPK go the first out just fine, but then let pinch-hitter Rowdy Telles hit a homer out to center field. Our offense failed to rise to the occasion in the bottom of the ninth, so we were off to extras. 6-6 TIE\nJoe Mantiply was our 10th inning guy tonight, and sadly, it didn’t go well. The first batter Mantiply faced, with the Manfred Man on second, was Tyrone Taylor, who had homered to lead off the sixth against Middleton. Taylor did it again against Mantiply, sending one over the wall in left center. And that’s your final margin, as Mantiply did his job the rest of the way but we did nothing in the bottom of the 10th. 8-6 Milwaukee FINAL\nWin Probability Added, courtesy of Fangraphs\n\n  \n        \n  \nTiger Blood: Cooper Hummel (3 AB, 2 H, 2 R, 1 RBI, 2 2B, +22.9% WPA), Geraldo Perdomo (3 AB, 2 H, 1 R, 1 RBI, 1 BB, 1 SB, +22.0% WPA)Bi-Winning: Daulton Varsho (3 AB, 1 H, 1 R, 2 RBI, 1 HR, 1 BB, +10.4% WPA)Charlie Sheen: Joe Mantiply (1 IP, 1 H, 1 ER, 1 HR, -27.2% WPA)\nLively and vigorous Gameday Thread tonight, with 294 comments total at time of writing. as near as I can tell, there are three comments that went Sedona Red. One of them is an animated GIF, which is sadly a no-go. One of the others is mine, and the last is the response to mine, which is an image but not a GIF, so we’re going to go with that one. CotG, therefore, goes to Diamondhacks. It was kind of a joke that built, though, so I’m going to give you the whole thing:\n  \n        \n  \nAs for tomorrow, we still have a good chance to take down another series win against a winning team, as Zac Gallen climbs the hill tomorrow to face Milwaukee righthander Jason Alexander. First pitch is 1:10pm AZ time. Join us if you dare.\nThanks for reading, as always. And as always, go Diamondbacks!\nONE LAST THING\nLike I said at the top, this one wasn’t so bad, and the reason why it wasn’t for me, even though we lost, was that we got to watch our young position players, the potential future core of our team a year or two from now, keep trying and scrapping and fighting and keeping it close. I love watching that. But, as we have seen so many times this year, and in recent years, our pitching lost it for us. Specifically, tonight, it was our bullpen. And let’s have a quick look at the ones in our bullpen who did us harm tonight:\nKenyan Middleton, Angels bullpen castoff from last year, claimed off the scrap heap and signed in free agency on December 1, 2021. (1 IP, 1 HR, 1 ER)\nReyes Moronta, Dodgers bullpen castoff and waiver wire claim after the 2022 trade deadline. (1⁄3 IP, 1 H, 1 inherited runner scored)\nIan P. Kennedy, 38 years old, over-the-hill free agent, signed in free agency as a backup closer for Mark Melancon on March 16, 2022. (1 IP, 1 HR, 1 ER)\nThese dudes, along with Caleb Smith and Joe Mantiply, lost us the game, which is what, as Diamondbacks fans, we have come to expect from our bullpen, for years now. I’m tired of it, and I’m especially tired of seeing it happen at the hands of people who are already, by and large, known quantities at the major league level. So.\nIf our bullpen is going to continue to lose games for us, I would vastly prefer that we let our own homegrown kiddos do it, so at least we can see them work and learn more about what their talents and capabilities might be going forward. Bring up Corbin Martin, and put him in the bullpen. Bring up Ryne Nelson (oh, wait, we are), bring up Brandon Pfaadt, bring up other AAA prospects whose names I don’t know, and let them fill out the bullpen. Do for the bullpen what we’ve done in the last month with the position players, and let the kiddos play. The results for the position players have actually been pretty damn positive, so why not give it a try with the young pitchers as well? It would certainly beat the hell out of what we’ve been doing with our bullpen now for years.\n#endrant#fornowatleast",

        "description": "Oscar Colás just keeps rising up the charts, now cracking the MLB Pipeline Top 100. | Rob Tringali/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Oscar Colás hits his 12th homer in Double-A and gets added to the Top 100 prospects in MiLB   \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nWell, hey, the Knights tried to make a reliever a starter again in Lincoln Henzman, and it worked out for the three innings he was out there. The bullpen part of it the rest of the game ended up leading to a loss, but Henzman started out really well. He did not allow a run over his three innings and struck out four. The late relievers had trouble holding the Charlotte lead, and gave up the game for an extra-inning loss, with Declan Cronin and Lane Ramsey allowed five runs the last three innings. \nThe offense was actually really good. There were 14 hits compared to just six strikeouts, and eight of the nine starters had hits. However, as a team, the hitters lacked run production due to just three extra-base hits. Zach Remillard led the team with three hits, with Lenyn Sosa leading the team in times on base (two singles and two walks), with four trips to first. He was the Triple-A MVP at South Side Sox last month, and though he did not show power today, it was still a great way to keep his September bubbling just as hot.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nA two-pitcher mix for the Barons did well together could not overcome some lackluster offense, leading to a Birmingham loss. Cristian Mena had his longest outing of Project Birmingham, with four innings of work. He just allowed three runs over the first three innings, so it wasn’t very successful. Chris Blewett took over for him to try and keep the game close for an offensive surge that never came. Blewett did his part, allowing no runs over his four innings. His command wasn’t great (three walks), but five strikeouts helped keep zeros on the board. \nOscar Colás led Birmingham’s bad offense with two hits, including one of the two homers of the day. He also entered MLB Pipeline’s Top 100 prospects during the game, so that was a nice way to celebrate the accomplishment.\n\n\nMoments before he entered our Top 100 Prospects list, @whitesox slugger Oscar Colas cranked his 19th home run of the year, 12th for the @BhamBarons! pic.twitter.com/5fw0LSuoMq— MLB Pipeline (@MLBPipeline) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nMoises Castillo had the other homer today.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nA low-scoring affair that saw the Dash come out on the downside of a walk-off, 10-inning loss. Alsander Womack was responsible for both runs scored in the third for Winston-Salem, a two-RBI single that was the only hit he had in the game. Ben Norman and Taishi Nakawake were the other two batters to have hits. It was pretty much a strikeout day for the lineup, with 16 punchouts to just five men on base — not a good recipe for success.\nThe arms on the mound led the team today, and that started with five good innings from Chase Solesky. He only allowed two runs and struck out six. He will hopefully be in Birmingham next year, presuming the older pitchers in Charlotte are not back. The pen was good behind Solesky with the only run allowed being the zombie runner in the 10th. \n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nIt was all going so well for Kannapolis, with a four-run lead after two innings. Shane Murphy, the 14th round selection in this past draft, had another good two-inning stint, with no runs allowed. He is not getting a strikeout pitch going right now, but there’s still reason to see his few innings this year in the pros as something meaningful. The middle of the bullpen just had a real hard time, with eight runs allowed, although two came because of errors; Noah Owen and Kole Ramage struggled in those 4 1⁄3 innings, and that ended up being the game. \nThe bats did what they needed to do, with seven runs off of 11 hits and three walks. Tim Elko had the best game of the bunch, with three hits. He has not necessarily had a bad start to his pro career, but he certainly has struggled to make contact. That seems to be a thing of the past, as Elko is up to a .310 average right now for Kannapolis. Brooks Baldwin and Logan Glass rounded out the bats who had multiple hits.",

        "description": "The writer and classicist’s rollicking fourth novel, a reframing of the myth of Perseus and Medusa, questions our perception of the monsters and the heroesNatalie Haynes began Pandora’s Jar (2020), her excellent nonfiction collection of essays about women in Greek myth, with the image of herself as a child, sitting on the sofa with her brother watching Clash of the Titans. Although that film inspired Haynes to study Classics, she never thought to question the presentation of Medusa. “She wasn’t a character,” she wrote, “she was just a monster… It would be years before I came across any other version of Medusa’s story, anything that told me how she became a monster, or why.”This childhood memory appears to have inspired Haynes’s fourth novel, Stone Blind, which reframes the familiar myth of Perseus and Medusa as the story of an innocent girl corrupted and destroyed by an unforgiving world. We first meet Medusa as a baby abandoned on the Gorgon Shore of Libya: a rocky, unpeopled place. She is cared for by her sisters, Sthenno and Euryale. At first, it is unclear if Medusa is truly related to these terrifying creatures “with their tusks and their snaking manes of hair”. Medusa has wings, it’s true, and serpentine hair, but otherwise she looks human. What’s more, the child is mortal, unlike her sisters. We begin to perceive her as the sisters perceive her: they “hoped once again that they had kept her from feeling what they knew to be true: that she was a freak whose birth had horrified both parents”. Here we find the book in a nutshell – ideas of what is monstrous are culturally conditioned, predicated on fear of the unknown. As the sisters learn to love Medusa, they no longer find her monstrous. Unfortunately, Poseidon also catches sight of her, and, just after her 16th birthday, he engineers a meeting whose conclusion is as horrifying as it is inevitable.Stone Blind by Natalie Haynes is published by Pan Macmillan (£18.99).

        "description": "(Stones Throw) Post-genre American musician Brittney Parks extends her range yet further on her dizzying second albumEighteen tracks long and hellbent on swerving lanes, Sudan Archives’ second album proper is one of those records that invites you to get comfortable in its dizzying headspace. Drawing from a wide array of sources – hip-hop, R&amp;B, west African traditions, club beats, up-to-date digitals, analogue handclaps, looped strings – it all hangs together as a portrait of an artist keen to emphasise her range and primacy. Or, as Sudan Archives puts it on OMG Britt, a straight-up trap track: “They gonna have a fit when they hear this shit!”Born in Cincinnati (that’s the 513 area code of the closing track) but relocated to LA, Brittney Parks is a post-genre operative whose skillset seems to expand with each release. Natural Brown Prom Queen brings her closer to the mainstream, thanks to takes on R&amp;B that range from the canonical – Ciara, Freakalizer – to the more restless: Home Maker, or ChevyS10, a booty call where Parks deploys an angelic falsetto, a quote from Tracy Chapman’s Fast Car and an on-trend disco denouement. Parks’s earworms don’t hurt either. As woozy and restless as these multipart productions are, she packs in plenty of sticky stuff: melodies, hooks, insistent figures. On the glorious title track, she chafes against colourism up against a Middle Eastern string loop that doesn’t quit.  Continue reading...",

        "description": "From sand-speck to intrepid traveller, Michael Malay considers the metamorphosis of the eel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Anguilla anguilla / Eels by Dafydd Parri on Flickr\n\n\n\nOn the birth and death of eels\n\n\n\nEels are tiny when they are born, no bigger than a speck of sand, and completely transparent. If you could look through them, you would see into the world. As they grow older, though, they begin to absorb light, to bend and to capture it. Their skin darkens, their bodies lengthen, and their translucency is replaced by a brackish brown. Streaks of yellow run down their flanks, like bars of muddy gold, and their eyes grow more pronounced. The speck of sand has become a yellow eel.\n\n\n\nThe transformations only continue, change following change. As they grow, their yellow flanks darken, shade into umber, until, reaching full maturity, they take on the colours of a starry midnight. A slick, glossy black covers their top half, while their underbellies take on a silvery sheen. Glints of brown and green cover their back like flecks of mica. The yellow eel has become a silver eel.\n\n\n\nLater, when they are ready to breed, eels will abandon their mud-holes in the river and turn their noses west, to the Sargasso Sea. It’s a place they hardly know, having left it when they were only a few days old. But it’s a region written into their bodies, and to which they return with unerring precision. During the day, they dive down to depths of two hundred metres, before moving upwards again at night. Their voyage thus describes a kind of sinewave, a diurnal dipping followed by a nocturnal surfacing: the arc of their homecoming.\n\n\n\nThe journey back is determinedly single-minded. Eels do not eat as they swim west, having already prepared for this voyage by storing up rich layers of fat. This is why they are rarely caught at sea. They are not returning for themselves but for the future, which makes itself felt as an itch in their bellies. After breeding, it is thought that adult eels simply perish and fall to the sea floor, where they turn into so much silt. But what survives them is instinct: millions of eggs floating up to the surface of the sea, like sparks from an unseen anvil. Each egg is a tiny plasma of light, each an eel waiting to be born.\n\n\n\nSpringtime\n\n\n\nElvers – the name for juvenile eels – arrive in Britain in the spring. And sometimes, in tidal rivers such as the Severn, they surge upstream on the spring tides of April and May. Part of the magic of elvers, then, part of their elvish charm, is how they unite the various meanings of spring. They leap into our world as the sap begins to rise, on the first spring tides of the year. (Spring: from the Old English&nbsp;springan, meaning an energetic leap or a sudden burst.)\n\n\n\nAs with the return of swallows, elvers help fetch the year to us. Their entry into rivers is calendricallly precise, and if one could hover over the rivers of Britain, staying there patiently for days, for weeks, one would see what the kestrel sees: a greenness blooming as the elvers pass, an activating greenness that summons the wild garlic and bluebells of April, the cornflowers and dandelions of May…\n\n\n\nBorderlands&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEels are finding it harder to live here. After arriving in Britain, fresh from their Sargasso voyage, they meet with a series of strange riddles: dams, sluice gates, tidal fences, barrages, weirs. Today, there are more than one million man-made obstructions in rivers and streams across Europe.\n\n\n\nThe contradiction couldn’t be greater. On one hand, the obduracy of concrete and the flushness of steel, and on the other hand, this sinuous rope of changing life. An eel undergoes no fewer than four metamorphoses throughout its life, as it transforms from being a leptocephalus&nbsp;to an elver, and then from yellow eel to a silver eel. It is an emissary from a world of flows, which is everywhere being met by borders and walls. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nI am always being born, it says, and now – can you hear it? – watch me as I disappear. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe voyage back\n\n\n\nIt is night and the eels are stirring. They are gliding along rivers and streams, back towards the estuaries, feeling their way to the memory of salt. There are millions of them, cells tingling with the call of home, and later, following some instinct, they will nose out into those bigger waters, into the astonishment of the sea. This time, though, everything has changed: the rivers they leave behind, so unfamiliar at first, are the only worlds they know, whereas the Sargasso Sea, where they were born, is a place of mystery.\n\n\n\nLow clouds over the hills; rain falling on the river; and water mixing with water, at those edgeless places where river becomes estuary becomes sea. Soon, the eels will leave this all behind. For now, though, they are waiting in the dark, eyes watching the moon. \n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nAn earlier version of this piece was published by Bristol University&#8217;s Centre of Environmental Humanities.\n\n\n\nMichael Malay is a teacher and writer based in Bristol. His first book, ‘Late Light’, will be appearing in 2023.\n\n\n\nAlongside poet, Guillemot Press founding editor, and fellow eel enthusiast Luke Thompson, Michael will revel in eel appeal as part of our lineup for this year&#8217;s Camp Good Life, which takes place in Hawarden, Wales, later this month.

        "description": "The Minnesota State Fair had plenty to eat during its earliest years — just not for humans. While the livestock stayed fed, people were something of an afterthought. That changed in 1897 when a group of women from Hamline Methodist Episcopal Church decided fairgoers would enjoy sandwiches and cold drinks — something they could make and serve while representing their church at the fair and fundraising. Fair-goers enjoy the dine-in option at Hamline Church Dining Center. The Hamline Church Dining Center is celebrating its 125th anniversary at the Minnesota State Fair.Sam Stroozas | MPR NewsFood became central to the fair experience, and the Hamline Church Dining Hall became a staple of fair life, a tradition that 125 years later continues to thrive amid the fried ice cream, falafel on a stick, pronto pups, turkey legs and other creative eats that dominate fair life now.It’s one of the last two church halls at the State Fair and it fills up the second it opens at 7 a.m. The hall has modernized through the years but basics like the classic ham loaf and wild rice meatballs remain in high demand. The women of the Ladies Aid Society might still recognize the place.A 1948 photo of the interior of the Hamline Church Dining Hall at the Minnesota State Fair. What started as sandwiches and cold drinks evolved into a fair staple.Courtesy of the Minnesota State Fair Archives“I wonder what they’re thinking about now, you know? Did they think their dream was going to happen and we would still be here?” said Teresa Renneke, a committee member and 40-year volunteer at the hall.The hall, she said, offers an oasis in the constant throng of people moving while eating at the fair. “You can come inside and have dishware and silverware and actually sit down, it’s really just the atmosphere,” she said. “We always try to evolve.” Many people, she added, begin their day at the church hall. Being right near the front gates doesn’t hurt.The Hamline Church Dining Hall in 1948. They are now celebrating their 125th anniversary at the Minnesota State Fair.Courtesy of the Minnesota State Fair ArchivesJan and Bob King of Savage Minn., come to the fair one day a year, and they always start their day at Hamline. Bob said he’s been going since he was a kid. Jan started joining him about 20 years ago when they moved back to Minnesota. “It’s good to start your day with nourishing food like this,” Bob said Wednesday morning at the hall. “You can sit down and get your day started. And they’re just unbelievable, you all but sit down and they come to refill your coffee.” A 1986 photo of the Hamline Church Dining Hall at the Minnesota State Fair.Courtesy of the Minnesota State Fair ArchivesBeyond the signature dishes, the hall has added a few favorites, including the Hamline egger — an English muffin, ham, eggs and cheese. Thanks to a partnership with Al’s Breakfast in Minneapolis, blueberry pancakes instantly became a 2022 State Fair draw.“It’s been really amazing. They’re a lovely group of people,” said Al’s Breakfast owner Alison Kirwin, who’s been flipping pancakes daily at the church hall. We’re both recognizable Minnesota brands, so it made sense.”They’d discussed a partnership a few years ago but then came COVID-19. Joining forces now for the hall’s 125th anniversary felt like a “natural step,” Kirwin said.Alison Kirwin of Al&#x27;s Breakfast is on pancake duty during the 2022 Minnesota State Fair serving up Al&#x27;s famous blueberry pancakes for Hamline Church Dining Hall.Sam Stroozas | MPR NewsOn the first day of the fair this year, the Hamline Church Dining Hall was named “Grandest Stand of All” for its authentic, time-honored menu. To celebrate their anniversary, they are offering birthday cake flavored paletas, a new State Fair food.Volunteers on Friday weaved in and out among the tables with napkins or hot coffee. For some, the yearly fair tradition is part of their summer tradition and they can’t imagine it any other way. That includes Aileene Vanderbilt of Roseville, who has been volunteering for 65 years at the hall. While she says she didn’t want to do the math, she guessed that she began volunteering as a young teenager. There are newbies and regulars at the tables, but she says it’s a first stop for many at the fair.“I volunteer every single year, we have to be doing something right,” she said. “The food is very good and, hey, I think we’re pretty friendly too.”Blueberry pancakes from Al&#x27;s Breakfast in Minneapolis was the most popular item that Hamline Church Dining Hall served during their partnership at the 2022 Minnesota State Fair.Sam Stroozas | MPR News",

        "description": "A training course on helping to prevent pollution from road salt is being offered in Spanish for the first time in the Twin Cities. The pilot course, designed by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, aims to teach property managers &quot;smart salting&quot; practices to reduce chloride pollution in lakes, rivers and streams.The Lower Mississippi River Watershed Management Organization is offering the virtual course in Spanish on Sept. 19. As part of its 10-year plan, the watershed organization is expanding its outreach and multilingual education to more people, including Latino communities in West and South St. Paul, said administrator Joe Barten.“We identified that we really haven&#x27;t done a great job of reaching out to those communities in the past,” he said. “So we saw this as an opportunity to try something new.”The training course is geared toward people who manage private or public property, including landscaping or maintenance companies that maintain roads, sidewalks and parking lots for apartment buildings, shopping malls and homeowners’ associations.“There&#x27;s all of those private companies that are out there spreading salt with smaller vehicles that account for a lot of the use on the landscape,” Barten said.

Ask MadisonMayo ClinicHealth provider goes on low-salt diet — for roads and sidewalksChloride from road salt is causing water quality problems throughout the Twin Cities and other parts of the state. About 50 Minnesota lakes and streams are considered impaired due to excess chloride levels, including Thompson Lake in West St. Paul.Barten, who’s also a senior resource conservationist with the Dakota County Soil and Water Conservation District, said water monitoring shows spikes in chloride levels in the watershed’s lakes and streams that are affecting aquatic life. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t look like a big deal on one property, on one driveway, on one parking lot,” he said. “But our water bodies, our lakes and our streams, they&#x27;re receiving the cumulative effect from every single property in the watershed.&quot;The training teaches about the impacts of salt on water resources and how to manage their property while reducing the total amount of salt they need to use.Property managers interested in the Sept. 19 course should register by Sept. 12.If the program is successful, the watershed organization will consider offering the course in other languages, Barten said.",

        "description": "King Lear may have divided the country in two and turned it against itself but perhaps, like the outgoing Tory leader, he ‘got all the big calls right’Boris Johnson’s “victory tour” is the insane peacock parade of a monster of a man who has ruined everything, trolling the entire country, rubbing the noses of those whose lives he has destroyed in the filth he has wall-spaffed into their faces. The French would have strewn burning tyres and broken baguettes all over the motorways by now, God bless them, and set fire to hayricks in the middle of rural roundabouts, while choking back successions of small sour drinks and making inscrutable obscene gestures at press corps helicopters. Instead, Brexit Britons sit around, tutting and shrugging into their milky tea as they dunk the soggy digestives of their impotence, like eunuchs in a penis factory. I hate us. We don’t deserve rock’n’roll.Johnson’s grand tour ought to feel like King Lear’s last route march around Britain, in the enduring tragedy of the same name, but it doesn’t, quite. Shakespeare depicted the mad monarch tramping from one now unwelcoming former supporter to another, his presence nothing more than an inconvenient embarrassment. But Johnson’s valedictory progress, as I write this on Wednesday, seems to be a success. In Dorset, he boasted of his broadband. In Barrow-in-Furness, he surveyed a submarine. It is not known if, in Islington, he posed proudly by the sofa upon which he had spaffed into a pole-dancing data analyst, who was then awarded tens of thousands of pounds of public money when his wife was away serving the British justice system. Doubtless his indefatigable supporters would have loved to have seen the stained cushions anyway. Funny Boris!“Poor naked wretches, whereso’er you are,That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,Your loop’d and window’d raggedness, defend youFrom seasons such as these?”Snowflake is on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer at 22:30 on 4 September, followed by Tornado on 11 September.

The people most interested in hiring me for my opinions about technology are usually less concerned with building tools that help people live better lives in the present than they are in identifying the Next Big Thing through which to dominate them in the future. I don’t usually respond to their inquiries. Why help these guys ruin what’s left of the internet, much less civilisation?Still, sometimes a combination of morbid curiosity and cold hard cash is enough to get me on a stage in front of the tech elite, where I try to talk some sense into them about how their businesses are affecting our lives out here in the real world.

It’s a rich, deep green bearing the crest of my son’s primary school, the one he will be attending just a week from now. Even with his uniform in front of me, I find that hard to take in. Instead, I admire how neat it is, and wonder how I’ll ever keep it clean.My primary school uniform was navy slacks and a blue jumper, over a white shirt sporting a grid of blue checked lines – leading the more waggish of our rivals to nickname us ‘the tea towels’. (Even at the time, we couldn’t fault that one – when you’re got, you’re got). My son’s shirt is block white, and without the elasticated navy tie that was de rigueur during my own schooling. Instead of addressing the vertiginous alarm that my son is now of school age, I wonder why children no longer have to wear ties and decide, vaguely, that it probably all changed after David Cameron.

        "description": "Photo by Cliff Welch/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Benintendi heads to IL; Judge hits 52nd home run in loss; Experts weigh in on Judge’s injury risk; Yankees swap one reliever for another ESPN | Marly Rivera: Andrew Benintendi was forced to leave Friday’s contest against the Rays after he felt a pop in his wrist following a swing in the third inning. Although the X-rays came back negative, the outfielder officially hits the 10-day IL with wrist inflammation. Benintendi was one of the few producing bats in the Yankees lineup with a 126 wRC+ over his last 26 games. Estevan Florial was called up to take his place on the roster.\nNew York Daily News | Kristie Ackert: The Yankees lost again, but at least Aaron Judge blasted another home run to give them a fighting chance in the ninth. The solo shot was his 52nd of the year, tying his previous career-high set during his 2017 Rookie of the Year campaign. It also cuts the gap to 61 to single-digits, as Judge is only nine home runs shy of tying Roger Maris’ AL record set in 1961.\nNew York Times | James Wagner: As Aaron Judge continues to assemble perhaps the greatest walk year in MLB history, whether he will earn $300 million (or more) in free agency hinges on one question: health. The superstar outfielder missed 156 games between 2018 and 2021 to a variety of ailments. Wagner spoke with several experts who weighed in on the impact of larger bodies on injury risk. The answer is complex already, made all the more complicated by the lack of precedent for a player of his age, size, and body type. \nNJ Advance Media | Brendan Kuty: Prior to Saturday’s game against the Rays, the Yankees activated the Scranton shuttle exchanging veteran relievers on the roster. They designated Anthony Banda for assignment following his meltdown on Friday when he allowed three runs without recording an out including a pair of bases-loaded walks. In his place, Ryan Weber earns his fourth call-up to the majors of the season. In three big league appearances, Weber has allowed one run in 7.2 innings including recording his first major league save — one of the three-inning variety — on July 16th.",

For some time it has been one of England’s most popular and iconic walks. The only surprising thing is how long the designation has taken.It was in 1973 that Alfred Wainwright extended his range from the Lake District by describing this 192-mile walk, which starts on the west coast at St Bees in Cumbria and ends in the east at Robin Hood’s Bay on the Yorkshire coast. There’s a handy book that you sign to show you’ve done it in the Bay Hotel and possibly a certificate. You can, of course, do it the other way around, but as Wainwright wisely pointed out, by going west to east you have the prevailing weather behind you. Continue reading...",

This week a new prime minister will be installed in Downing Street at the most testing time imaginable. Even February 1974, when Harold Wilson came to power and ended Britain’s three-day week, doesn’t really match up to the omni-crisis with which Boris Johnson’s successor has to grapple. Arguably, it is the grimmest inheritance since Winston Churchill’s in May 1940.All the smart money is on Liz Truss winning the race, although in retrospect it may come to be seen as a Pyrrhic victory because the new prime minister will arrive in office with the economy about to hit the wall, energy bills soaring, the pound crashing and the global financial markets selling off.

There is technically a chance they’ll win it. If they don’t, the Rays will sweep to pull within three games of first place in the AL East. It’s hard to describe what’s going on much more than that without launching into a diatribe. So, enjoy the baseball today, if you dare.\nAhead of today’s matinee, we bask in the absurd, as Matt looks deep into Yankee history to find a wild walk-off by Wally Pipp, while Jesse argues that the Yankees’ second-half collapse makes all the more sense when viewed as a farce. Also, Estevão looks at the Rays’ own adversity compared to the Yankees, and Joe takes us around the week in Yankee social media.\nToday’s Matchup\nNew York Yankees at Tampa Bay Rays\nTime: 1:40 p.m. ET\nTV: YES Network, Bally Sports Sun, MLB Network (out-of-market only)\nRadio: 1280 WADO, 660/101.9 FM WFAN\nVenue: Tropicana Field\nFun Questions/Prompts:\n1.

Christopher Shinn’s new play The Narcissist, set in 2017, centres on a former American presidential adviser who announces that in a digitally transfixed, utterly individualistic age, voters engage with politics as they do with dating apps: they use them as distractions, beginning with arousal and ending in disappointment. His own marriage is on the rocks; he is hesitantly bisexual, bereft – and vulnerable.Originally planned for 2020, Josh Seymour’s production swoops adroitly from shrewd argument to intimate dialogue and jittery sputter: two characters are addicted to opiates and everyone is fighting addiction to their screens. Jasmine Swan’s design glimmers with the drama’s possibilities: quietly opulent, with reflective walls and floor (so good for seeing yourself everywhere). Characters are first seen aloft in separate booths, outlined in neon, made for declamation and isolation. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photo by Justin Berl/Getty Images\n    \n\n  News and notes from Saturday.  Jake Odorizzi was originally scheduled to pitch Saturday’s game against Miami, but was scratched due to what was described as arm fatigue. Bryce Elder was recalled from Gwinnett to make the start. \nBrian Snitker said that Odorizzi was fine, but had been feeling the fatigue for a while. With Elder scheduled to start for Gwinnett Saturday, they had the opportunity to use him for a spot start and give Odorizzi more time by skipping him in the rotation. Snitker said that Odorizzi would start one of the games in Seattle on the upcoming road trip. \nMore Braves News\n\nA bases loaded walk in the ninth by Robbie Grossman delivered a 2-1 win for the Braves over the Marlins Saturday night. Bryce Elder was pressed into duty and tossed six scoreless innings while Austin Riley homered for the fourth straight game. \nI’m not sure how the Rookie of the Year race will come out, but you can’t go wrong with either Michael Harris or Spencer Strider. Strider’s record setting performance Thursday night was the latest reminder that his special season isn’t over yet. \n\nThe Braves currently have the fourth best schedule remaining with an opponents’ winning percentage of .504. The Cardinals (.469) and the Mets (.465) top the list. \n\nMLB News\n\n\nThe San Francisco Giants placed Alex Wood on the 15-day injured list with a shoulder impingement. Manager Gabe Kapler said that they would reevaluate Wood in about a week, but there is a chance that his season is over. \n\nThe New York Yankees placed outfielder Andrew Benintendi on the 10-day injured list Saturday due to inflammation in his wrist. The team also designated reliever Anthony Banda for assignment and recalled Estevan Florial and selected the contract of Ryan Weber to fill those spots on the active roster. \n\nThe New York Mets placed reliever Trevor May on the injured list without a designation. They selected right-hander Bryce Montes de Oca to take his place on the roster. Given that there was no reason for May and that Motes de Oca wasn’t on the 40-man roster means that May is dealing with some sort of Covid situation. \n\nRed Sox right-hander Tanner Houck will undergo back surgery next week and will miss the remainder of the season. \nInjured Rays shortstop Wander Franco is scheduled to join Triple A Durham Sunday to start a rehab assignment.",

        "description": "A fascinating history of the fruitless attempts by British high society to civilise, rather than appease, the Third ReichWhen Hitler rose to power in the early 1930s, public reaction in Britain was not that of unalloyed horror. Instead, it lay somewhere between disinterest, snobbish, if inaccurate, contempt (“the man’s a house painter!”), and, in some circles, quiet satisfaction that a vigorous reformer had shaken up his country in an apparently effective and forward-looking fashion. The evils of the Nazi regime were obvious to anyone with either a social conscience or a knowledge of history, but it was more convenient either to ignore them, or, in the case of a group of well-meaning but misguided society figures, to attempt to mitigate them by means of the so-called Anglo-German Fellowship.In this fascinating and deeply researched debut historical biography by businessman turned historian Charles Spicer, the leading lights of the Fellowship paint an unimpressive picture. They consisted of “a leftwing, pacifist Welsh political secretary, a conservative, butterfly-collecting Old Etonian businessman and a pioneering Great War fighter ace”. They were better known as David Lloyd George, Ernest Tennant and the Duke of Hamilton, and they combined high social standing with an unfortunate tendency to pursue freelance diplomacy unchecked either by government intervention or common sense. As Spicer writes, “they infiltrated the Nazi high command deeper than any of their countrymen to pass back better intelligence to both their government and its domestic critics”.

        "description": "In modern Britain, millions of kids grow up learning two languages or more – and experts believe fluidity in language has some surprising advantagesFor many three-year-olds growing up in the UK, it’s challenging enough to learn and master one language, usually English. Yet there’s another rising demographic of young children who are acquiring and absorbing vocabulary from multiple languages before they even start primary school.In 2021 there were around 6 million people with non-British nationality living in the UK, with 9.6m people born abroad – 35% of whom live in London. In the social sciences, this relatively new landscape of such diverse national origins is often referred to as “superdiversity” – a term coined by the German anthropologist Professor Steven Vertovec. The UK’s superdiversity is reflected in our school system, with around 20% of pupils speaking English as an additional language. In London schools, more than 300 different languages are spoken.

        "description": "President Biden has spent more time in Pennsylvania during his presidency than any other state besides his home locale of Delaware, and Democratic party operatives and insiders say he’s clung tight to his birth state for good reason.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPennsylvania is home to a critical midterm Senate pickup opportunity for Democrats in the race between Lt. Gov John Fetterman (D) and Republican Mehmet Oz. The state was also pivotal to Biden’s presidential win in 2020, as well as Democratic victories in the 2018 midterms and — importantly — losses in the 2016 election that put former President Trump in the White House.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut more than anything, Democrats say “Scranton Joe” has a special understanding of voters in the Keystone State.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Pennsylvania is personal to Joe Biden. It’s not at all a coincidence to me that he spends so much time there,” said Tom Perez,&nbsp;the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who is also a co-chairman of the Democratic group American Bridge. “You can take Joe Biden out of Pennsylvania, but you can’t take the Scranton out of Joe.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Biden will head to Milwaukee and Pittsburgh to attend Labor Day festivities, marking his third stop in Pennsylvania in the course of one week. He spoke about crime prevention and gun safety in Wilkes-Barre on Tuesday and two days later delivered a prime-time address railing against Trump and “MAGA Republicans” at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDavid Urban, a GOP strategist who served as Trump's 2016 senior adviser in Pennsylvania, observed that there are a number of Democrat-held House seats in Pennsylvania that the GOP could flip in November and that Biden’s trips signal an understanding among Democrats that they need to “fight back or die.”\n\n\n\nMark Knoller, a veteran White House correspondent who chronicles the details of presidential travel, said Biden has been to Pennsylvania 16 times since taking office, the second-highest number of visits behind Biden’s home state of Delaware, to which he has traveled 50 times during his presidency.\n\n\n\nBut even those who support Biden say he needs to spend some time going to other key states.&nbsp;Republican strategist Susan Del Percio, who supported Biden in the 2020 presidential race against Trump, said it’s “safe” and “convenient” for the White House to send Biden to the Keystone State.\n\n\n\nStill, Del Percio added, “I think they need to diversify.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Three visits in a week? That’s a bit much,” she said. “Joe from Scranton is now the President of the United States, which means he has all the trappings of the Oval Office and the world stage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“He can’t revive that like he did in 2020,” Del Percio said. “Frankly he has not been that great speaking off the cuff and while he thinks he has that role to play, it’s not the role he should be playing.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother strategist agreed, saying “the White House should be getting creative” about the optics and where they send Biden.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It looks lazy,” the strategist said&nbsp;of the president's frequent trips to the state.&nbsp;“It’s an easy, convenient place to send him but there are so many other places he can and should be going.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the trips are also important for Biden’s reelection ambitions, given recent polls showing him trailing Trump in Pennsylvania in a hypothetical 2024 rematch between the two men.\n\n\n\nAn Emerson College poll out late last month showed that Biden had a 39 percent approval rating in the state, while 57 percent disapproved of Biden’s role as president. The survey showed Trump leading Biden among Pennsylvania voters, 47 percent to 42 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It is a short term electoral imperative to help us flip that seat, and it is a longer term for 2024 imperative to make sure we are holding the governor’s seat in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin so that we are best positioned for the reelect,” Perez, who served as Democratic National Committee chairman from 2017 to 2021, said of Biden’s Pennsylvania-heavy travel schedule.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats are increasingly hopeful of the possibility that Fetterman tops Oz in the Pennsylvania Senate race to fill the seat vacated by retiring Sen. Pat Toomey (R). Polls have shown Fetterman leading Oz by a handful of points.\n\n\n\nEven with Biden’s appearances in the state, Fetterman hasn’t fully embraced the president. He was unable to attend the event in Wilkes-Barre but plans to meet with Biden in Pittsburgh on Labor Day. A Fetterman spokesman said that the Democratic candidate would press Biden on decriminalizing marijuana when the two meet.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Fetterman is not glued to Biden, but he’s not avoiding Biden,” said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way, describing the Pennsylvania seat as a pickup for Democrats “in the swingiest state you’ll find.”\n\n\n\nPolls have also shown Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) leading Republican state Sen. Doug Mastriano in the state's gubernatorial contest.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLonger term, it’s important for Biden to lay the groundwork for the 2024 presidential race, especially after the last races for the White House, strategists say. Trump won the state narrowly in 2016 and while Biden won the state by more than 80,000 votes, his rival was competitive in Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\nBiden delivered a speech from Philadelphia’s Independence Hall on Thursday in which he excoriated Trump and GOP candidates and lawmakers aligned with him as threats to democracy and the country itself, solidifying his midterm messaging but also offering a preview of his 2024 pitch should he follow through with plans to run for a second term.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUrban, the Republican strategist, called Biden’s speech in Philadelphia “politically tone deaf,” criticizing the content and stagecraft and noting that it took place at the same time as two major college football games in the state.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Who's going to watch the president when these two exciting games are on?” he asked.\n\n\n\nNotably, Trump also made an appearance in Pennsylvania this week at a rally on Saturday evening to support Oz and Mastriano, showcasing the attention that the former president is also giving to the Keystone State.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The last two elections have shown that it is now a swing state,”&nbsp;said Democratic strategist Rodell&nbsp;Mollineau, adding that it’s a must win along with Michigan and Wisconsin. “And I think in some ways, Pennsylvania is the crown jewel of those three.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs Biden’s poll numbers rebound, Mollineau added that Pennsylvania is “likely more friendly territory for him than other places in the country right now.”",

        "description": "Dundee RepTony Roper’s 1987 play conjures a vanished world whose hardship and longing for community feel nonetheless familiarThe world of The Steamie is long gone. Public laundries, where women came to wash their own – or other people’s – dirty laundry, had already almost disappeared by 1987, the year this play-with-songs was first presented by the leftwing company Wildcat Stage Productions. Set in the 1950s, it’s a couthie evocation of shared experiences and that spirit of communality that seemed to have been left behind when people moved away from their inner-city tenements and out to the housing schemes. To audiences in community venues across Glasgow in the 80s, it was almost as much a nostalgia piece as it is for us today. Yet if the details of the situation seem distant, at its core are shared experiences – of hardship and of loneliness – that feel sharply current.It’s New Year’s Eve. In separate stalls, at big, ceramic sinks, Magrit, Doreen and Dolly are doing their family washing while Mrs Culfeathers (addressed formally on account of her age) struggles to finish the doctor’s wife’s laundry before 9pm – closing time. As the women work, they talk and sing, sharing news (“What did he die of?” “Lack of breath!”), gossip (sometimes vicious), dreams (of a washing machine; of a man for once sober; of meeting great-grandchildren, far away in England).The Steamie is at Dundee Rep until 10 September Continue reading...",

        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/biden-student-debt-forgiveness-covid-relief-legal/671329/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "The Biden administration’s recently announced plan to reduce student debt for borrowers who earn less than $125,000 is popular, according to recent polls. Unfortunately, the plan has a major legal flaw: The administration’s arguments for its executive power to make such a broad effort under federal law will likely lose—and should lose—in the courts. The good news, for President Joe Biden and for borrowers, is that the administration has time to change those arguments.In conjunction with the announcement of the program, the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice issued a memo explaining the legal basis for it: the COVID-19 emergency. Unfortunately, no evidence has emerged that the Biden administration is tailoring the program to fit this justification, nor have Biden and his team offered any sign that they are taking seriously the Supreme Court’s recent administrative-law rulings or its clear skepticism about invoking the COVID-19 emergency as a reason for any far-reaching government policy.Legal challenges are inevitable. Private banks administer many of these loans, and they will incur millions in losses when the debts are canceled, meaning that those banks would have standing in federal courts. State programs may also be concretely affected, and such states also are likely to sue. These plaintiffs will probably prevail unless the Department of Education narrows the plan’s scope or relies on a different statute when it finalizes the policy.[Joseph E. Stiglitz: Actually, cancelling student debt will cut inflation]In its memo, the Office of Legal Counsel relied on a post-9/11 statute—the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students (or HEROES) Act of 2003—as the legal basis for this executive action. That statute, the OLC explained, allows the secretary of Education to make major changes to policy if “a national emergency” caused student borrowers to be “placed in a worse position financially.”The OLC concluded that the coronavirus pandemic fit the text of the statute as a “national emergency” and that a debt-relief program would ensure that Americans with student debt were not left in a “worse position.” As a matter of narrow textualism, all of this seems plausible. And as a matter of administrative law circa 1990 or 2000 or 2010, under a famous (or infamous) precedent known as Chevron, courts were supposed to defer to reasonable interpretations of ambiguous statutes.However, a lot of administrative law has changed over the past decade, especially in the past year. The Roberts Court has effectively abandoned Chevron deference to the executive branch in questions of “vast economic and political significance.” This new approach, known as “the major-questions doctrine,” does not turn on “textualism”—reading just the words of the statute on their own—but instead emphasizes the context, purposes, and legislative history of the statute. As a matter of theory and common sense, this distinction between “major questions” and more mundane or technical agency policies makes sense: Judges do not have the time or expertise to dig into the historical details of statutes in many mundane or technical cases, but when the policy is major, the statutory purposes are more readily discoverable, and they must be clear and salient to permit an executive agency to make a major policy change.The Roberts Court relied on this “major-questions doctrine” approach to strike down two of the Biden administration’s boldest COVID-emergency policies—the eviction moratorium and the vaccine-or-testing mandate at certain places of employment—and a significant Obama-era climate-change policy in West Virginia v. EPA.The OLC never cited any of these cases and never even hinted at this important new doctrine that demands thorough arguments about context and purposes. Instead, Biden’s OLC assumed that thin textual arguments would be sufficient. In a 25-page memo, it included less than one page focusing on the HEROES Act’s purpose and legislative history, and that page was cursory and unpersuasive. The context of the 2003 law was clearly the September 11 terrorist attacks, and an “emergency” would be shaped by that context. To suggest that COVID was not a national emergency in March 2020 or even March 2021 would be absurd. But it is far from obvious that we are still in a national emergency in August 2022, and it is even further from obvious that everyone making less than $125,000 is still in a “worse position” specifically because of COVID. Surely many middle-class Americans with student loans are, but many are not.The OLC memo and the shorter Department of Education memo are confusing on this COVID-impact question, but they both seem to concede that the program would have to be tailored to the COVID emergency in order to fit the statute. The OLC memo concludes, “Thus, to invoke the HEROES Act in the context of COVID-19, the Secretary would need to determine that the COVID-19 pandemic was a but-for cause of the financial harm to be addressed by the waiver or modification.” The Department of Education memo hints at the same limitation, but without any detail.Perhaps the biggest problem here is that the administration’s COVID explanation seems to be just a pretext for a broader program. The Biden administration offers no hint that its program would focus on COVID or proof of COVID causation, because COVID is not the real reason for sweeping debt relief. President Biden himself told us the real reasons for the program: long-term structural problems with education costs. “But here’s the deal,” Biden said. “The cost of education beyond high school has gone up significantly. The total cost to attend a public four-year university has tripled—nearly tripled in 40 years—tripled … An education is a ticket to a better life … But over time, that ticket has become too expensive for too many Americans.”Biden suggested only once that this program was related to COVID relief: After listing past COVID-relief programs, he said, “Now it’s time to address the burden of student debt in the same way.” But Biden never suggested that debt-relief applicants have to demonstrate that they are in a worse position because of COVID. Instead, he introduced the program as broad and applying categorically based on income, not pandemic effects.[Read: Biden’s cancellation of billions in debt won’t solve the larger problem]A narrowing for COVID causation is also not consistent with the Biden administration’s estimates for the program’s cost and breadth: On Friday, the White House estimated a total of canceled loan repayments of $24 billion a year, or about $240 billion over a decade. Some nonpartisan groups estimate a cost of $500 billion over a decade. This size is inconsistent with a COVID-tailored relief program.That COVID is not the real reason for such a sweeping program is a serious legal problem. In another recent case, Department of Commerce v. New York, the Roberts Court struck down a citizenship question on the census because the Court correctly assessed that the Trump administration’s publicly stated reason was just a pretext, and that the real reason was partisan advantage. Quite obviously, the Biden administration’s reasons for student-debt forgiveness are nothing like the odious motives (and apparent racism) underlying the Trump Commerce Department’s census design, but nevertheless, administrative law requires that an agency’s policy not be “arbitrary and capricious.” If the Biden Department of Education student-debt policy does not fit the public rationale and statutory argument of a COVID-relief program, then the Biden administration could lose, possibly 9–0, when a case about the program comes before the Court. The Biden administration needs to tailor the program to COVID causation if it sticks with this statute.But even if the program were to meet that bar, the major-questions doctrine will still be a hurdle. And if the administration keeps relying on thin and narrow textual arguments rather than context, it will lose. Keep in mind that the Biden administration lost when it relied on statutes with closer purpose-based connections to pandemics in the eviction-moratorium and vaccine-mandate cases. The Roberts Court would probably find the nexus between student debt and a fading pandemic even more tenuous.Finally, there is a matter of legal and democratic principle. Democrats were outraged when the Trump administration abused executive power and invoked emergencies to achieve cynical wins. Progressives were rightly critical of that administration’s bad-faith reasons for Muslim bans, border walls, citizenship questions, family-separation policies, and more. Relief from student debt is entirely unlike those policies on a moral level, and in fact, means-tested student-debt relief is probably good policy, on balance. But as a matter of principle, the Biden administration should give its real reasons for a good policy, and it should do so under a statute that supports those reasons.Such a statute may exist in plain sight: the Higher Education Act of 1965, which allows the Department of Education to “enforce, pay, compromise, waive, or release any right, title, claim, lien, or demand, however acquired, including any equity or any right of redemption.” The purpose of this clause and this statute appears to fit the real structural social reasons for the Biden administration’s broad policy.[Jerusalem Demsas: Who really benefits from student-loan forgiveness?]Maybe the administration has already researched the text and context of the Higher Education Act and found a problem with Plan A that other experts have missed. But this Plan B COVID argument is likely doomed, so Plan C would be a much smaller and more complicated program focused on COVID-causation claims.  Alternatively, the Biden OLC may be relying on COVID as a onetime emergency to reassure Wall Street and the banks that it is not interested in deeper structural reform. Not only will the Roberts Court likely kill this program before it can even go into effect, but the Biden administration will have added yet another bad precedent of presidents invoking emergency powers as a pretext. No matter which party is in power, no matter how well-intentioned a policy is, this approach is a dangerous one, and the Biden administration should know better.",

        "description": "In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at Harlem’s Riverside Church to a crowd of thousands that flowed out the door as far as 120th Street. King publicly condemned the Vietnam War because it had “broken and eviscerated” the civil-rights and anti-poverty movements at home. The American government was “the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.”Read: Martin Luther King Jr. on the Vietnam WarIn 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky invoked another MLK speech while asking Congress to help his country repel the Russian invasion. “‘I have a dream.’ These words are known to each of you today. I can say, ‘I have a need: I need to protect our sky.’” Two months later, Democrats voted unanimously in favor of a $40 billion package of arms and other assistance to Kyiv.     These two moments capture an important shift in how the American left thinks about the U.S. military and war more generally. Progressives typically see war as inherently murderous and dehumanizing—sapping progress, curtailing free expression, and channeling resources into the “military-industrial complex.” The left led the opposition to the Vietnam War and the Iraq War and condemned American war crimes from the My Lai massacre to Abu Ghraib. Historically, progressive critics have charged the military with a litany of sins, including discrimination against LGBTQ soldiers and a reliance on recruiting in poor communities.Meanwhile, for decades, the right embraced America’s warriors. Defense hawks were one of the three legs of the “Reagan stool,” along with social and fiscal conservatives. The military itself leaned right. One study found that from 1976 to 1996, the number of Army officers who identified as Republican increased from one-third to two-thirds. In 2016, according to a poll in the Military Times, active service members favored Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton by a margin of nearly two to one.In the past few years, however, these views have started to change. From 2021 to 2022, the share of Republicans who had “a great deal” or “quite a lot of confidence” in the military fell from 81 to 71 percent, whereas for Democrats, the number increased from 63 to 67 percent—cutting the gap from 18 points to four. And the military’s views shifted in tandem. In 2020, dozens of former Republican national-security officials endorsed President Joe Biden because Trump had “gravely damaged America’s role as a world leader.” In one poll before the 2020 election, more active service members backed Biden than Trump (41 to 37 percent).Why has this happened? Two big reasons are Trump and Ukraine.Trump saw the military as a symbol of power and surrounded himself with a phalanx of generals. But when he realized they were not a Praetorian Guard that would do his bidding, defend him against all enemies foreign and domestic, and keep him in office by force if necessary, he soured on the military. Trump trampled on its most sacred beliefs and rituals, saying that U.S. generals were “dopes” and “babies” who “want to do nothing but fight wars.” Americans killed in battle, he said, were “losers” and “suckers.” Trump suggested that Gold Star families had spread COVID at the White House. He railed against American prisoners of war: “I like people who weren’t captured.” He pardoned three service members accused or convicted of war crimes, even though military leaders said it would erode the military’s code of justice. In his testimony to Congress, Trump’s acting defense secretary, Christopher Miller, said that Trump had told him to ready the National Guard to protect his supporters on January 6, rather than Congress itself. All of this created a fundamental clash with the military’s code of honor and its commitment to the Constitution. Trump wondered why American generals couldn’t be more like Hitler’s generals—by which he meant the loyalist fanatics who battled in the ruins of Berlin, not the Wehrmacht officials who tried to assassinate the Nazi dictator.Since he left office, Trump has fueled the conservative belief that Biden is indoctrinating the armed forces with liberal ideas. Republican Senator Ted Cruz said the U.S. military is suffering from a “woke cancer” and is in danger of becoming “a bunch of pansies.” The Fox News host Laura Ingraham suggested defunding the military until it abandons its diversity programs: “Go after their budget.”It’s true that the military has moved left, and not just because of Trump. After George Floyd was murdered in 2020, Kaleth Wright tweeted: “Who am I? I am a Black man who happens to be Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force.” Last year the Pentagon warned, “To keep the nation secure, we must tackle the existential threat of climate change.”This shouldn’t be so surprising. The military is the epitome of big government, with egalitarian wages, socialized medicine, and the best government-run child-care system in the country. No wonder General Wesley Clark joked that it’s “the purest application of socialism there is.” Now progressives are expressing a new gratitude for an institution that understands the value of diversity, cares about the rule of law, and was willing to stand up to Trump when the future of democracy was most in danger. At a time of rampant conspiracy theories like QAnon, liberals appreciate that the military operates in a world of tangible threats and complex logistics and has a basic respect for reality. George Orwell said people often cling to falsehoods until the lie slams into the truth, “usually on a battlefield.”Then came Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. No foreign conflict since the Spanish Civil War has so captured the imagination of the left. Nearly a century ago, many progressives saw Spain as a pure fight between democracy and fascism. Ernest Hemingway’s novel For Whom the Bell Tolls and Pablo Picasso’s painting Guernica captured the horror at fascist brutality. About 3,000 Americans traveled to Spain to fight in the international brigades. Today, many on the left see Ukraine as another contest between fascism and democracy, and that rare thing: a good war. Thousands of Americans have gone to join the struggle.Russian President Vladimir Putin is the antithesis of everything the left stands for. Not only did he launch an unprovoked attack on a sovereign democratic nation, but he has also disparaged LGBTQ rights, multiculturalism, and immigration, and claimed that “the liberal idea” has “outlived its purpose.” Zelensky, in contrast, has built bridges with the global left. He addressed the Glastonbury music festival, in the U.K., where the revelers chanted his name to the tune of The White Stripes’ “Seven Nation Army.” In Germany, the Green Party led the charge to supply weapons to Kyiv, overturning decades of German wariness about intervening in foreign wars. LGBTQ protesters in Berlin also demanded that Germany step up arms shipments to Ukraine, so that a Pride parade can, one day, be held in the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol. Ukrainian liberals—artists, translators, teachers, filmmakers—have joined the struggle. As one writer put it: “All our hipsters in Ukraine fight.”To be sure, there’s a leftist fringe in the United States that still considers America the world’s evil empire and remains deeply hostile to its military power. That fringe includes the linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky, who praised Trump as a model statesman for pushing for a negotiated peace in Ukraine. But the bulk of the left has shown remarkable solidarity with the Ukrainian cause. Liberals who once protested the Iraq War now urge Washington to dispatch more rocket launchers to defeat Russian imperialism. Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York, a member of the progressive caucus, tweeted: “We unequivocally stand with the global Ukrainian community in the wake of Putin’s attack.”The main opposition to helping Ukraine has come from the right. Trump, who has long praised Putin as a “genius,” questioned why Americans were sending so much money to Ukraine. Most congressional Republicans backed the aid package to Kyiv in May, but 11 Republican senators and 57 House Republicans opposed it. Republican Representative Matt Gaetz tweeted that if the GOP takes the House in the upcoming midterms, support for Ukraine will end. The Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed that Ukraine is an American puppet state, and that his real enemies are not in Moscow but on the American left: “Has Putin ever called me a racist?”In March, Democrats were 10 points more likely than Republicans to say that Washington “has a responsibility to protect and defend Ukraine from Russia.” By July, this gap had grown to 22 points. Another recent survey found that Democrats were more supportive than Republicans of sending weapons to Ukraine as well as of accepting Ukrainian refugees in the United States. A remarkable 42 percent of Democrats favored deploying American troops to Ukraine, versus 34 percent of Republicans.Progressives have always viewed foreign conflicts and domestic struggles as connected—with war being either a dangerous contagion or a righteous crusade. A poster from the Spanish Civil War showed the image of a dead child: “If you tolerate this, your children will be next.” A generation later, the pendulum swung, and King saw intervention in Vietnam as a threat to civil rights in America. Today, the pendulum has swung back, and the left sees the march for freedom in America and the battle to defend Ukraine as elements of the same global fight for democracy. After all, the aggressor in Ukraine—Putin—also meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump.Will the alliance between the left and the military last? Progressives may grow nervous about escalation in Ukraine or lose interest in the war. The economy remains the most pressing issue for most Americans. Perhaps, like Orwell in Catalonia, some American volunteers in Ukraine may decide that the struggle is not as pure as they thought. The left’s underlying concerns about the U.S. military have hardly disappeared. Republicans may one day shove Trump offstage and try to get the ’80s band back together—defense hawks, social conservatives, and fiscal conservatives.But for now, Trump remains the dominant force in the Republican Party. The Ukrainian cause remains resonant. And the left may worry about another authoritarian great power that threatens a smaller democracy: China mobilizing against Taiwan.An era of liberal hawkishness should not mean an unthinking embrace of the military. America needs a strong progressive voice to check the rampant waste in the military-industrial complex (which ran to hundreds of billions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan). The military has very real problems, like the crisis of sexual assault. It doesn’t benefit from the sort of soft-focus “Thank you for your service” reverence that has prevented people from asking tough questions about America’s disastrous wars in the past. On Ukraine, liberals can channel Washington’s policy in a more progressive direction, stressing human rights, pressing for investment in green technology to reduce reliance on Russian energy, and going after Moscow’s dirty money.In the end, the U.S. military is the world’s anti-fascist insurance policy. The insurance premiums may be outlandish. And most of the time we don’t need the policy. Until one day we do. If you need to ship M777 howitzers to Ukraine, the military-industrial complex has its uses.In 1967, King was right to see Vietnam as a catastrophe for America, at home and abroad. “If America’s soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read: Vietnam.” But today we face a different world, and a stark choice. Zelensky, Ukrainian progressives, and the European Union? Or Putin, Trump, and Tucker Carlson? The left picked the right side.",

        "description": "Assembly George Square, EdinburghThe Australian physical comedian conjures up a career for himself as a professional spear-thrower in this wacky if uneven showThere is a distinguished, if niche, tradition of shows that pursue a comedian’s nerdy sporting enthusiasms. Kieran Hodgson’s unforgettable cycling number, Lance, pedals to mind. In his show Javelin, Australian comedian Tom Walker imagines that he spent 12 years as a professional spear-thrower. It recounts this hypothetical career, and Walker’s deep respect for all-time javelin champ Jan Železný, in fits and starts, interspersed with mime sketches and standup chat on different subjects entirely. From a brilliant tongue-in-cheek intro video onwards, there is lots to enjoy about the show, even if the javelin conceit does not soar. The performance I saw was not greatly helped by Walker’s climactic outburst about his not-entirely-positive Edinburgh fringe experience – which London audiences will presumably be spared on the current Soho theatre run.

        "description": "Dan Brink\n    \n\n  The Yankees and Aaron Judge followed the script, losing pitifully while Judge did what he could to try and carry the team. Welcome back to the Aaron Judge Home Run Record Tracker! We’re taking a daily look at where Aaron Judge’s monster season tracks compared to some of the other historic single-season home run leaders in anticipation of Judge potentially joining their ranks. We’ll be going by Team Game because not every player’s seasons were in sync with the calendar days and everyone didn’t play all of the team’s games, which makes this our universal standard. Now, for Game 133:\nAaron Judge through Game 133 of 2022: 52 HR\nTeam Game 133: 9/3 — 2-for-4, 1 HR, 2 RBI, 1 R, 2 K\nThis game was almost too on the nose. The Yankees wasted a strong overall pitching performance, looking entirely inept and/or uninterested at the plate. Aaron Judge did what he could, smashing a home run in the ninth to try and bring his team back from the brink:\n\nBut of course, no one was on base for Judge’s blast. What could have been a game-tying or go-ahead dinger was merely a solo shot that cut the Rays’ lead in half. Judge has 52 homers in 133 games, a genuinely magical performance that is being overshadowed by the putrid performance of the players around him. \nRoger Maris through Game 133 of 1961: 51 HR\nTeam Game 133: 8/31 — 0-for-4, 1 BB, 1 K\nA tough game for Maris, and in fact, one of his toughest of the entire 1961 campaign. By WPA this was Maris’ 10th-worst game of the year. Zoom in on this performance’s impact on the Yankees’ title chances, and this was actually Maris’ fifth-worst game of 1961 by Championship Probability Added, with CPA estimating that Maris took about half a percentage point off of the Yankees’ World Series odds with this game. It makes some sense, as the Yankees were clinging to a 2.5-game lead in the AL on the Detroit Tigers entering the day, a lead that was trimmed to 1.5 games by the end of play.\nBabe Ruth through Game 133 of 1927: 47 HR\nTeam Game 133: 9/6 (2) — 1-for-4, 1 HR, 1 RBI, 1 R, 1 K\nThe Babe continued his tremendous sixth of September, notching another homer in the back half of a doubleheader against the Red Sox after smashing two earlier in the day. The Yankees and Boston would play the final game of a five-game series the next day, and as you’ll see tomorrow, Ruth finished off the set in style.\nBarry Bonds through Game 133 of 2001: 56 HR\nTeam Game 133: 8/29 — 1-for-3, 1 BB, 1 K\nA relative quiet game for Bonds, as notching a single and a walk in four trips to the plate lowered his season OPS from 1.320 to a measly 1.316. As has been said before in this space, even in Bonds’ worst games of 2001, he still typically found his way onto the base paths a couple times and found a way to impact the game offensively. \nMark McGwire through Game 131 of 1998: 54 HR\nTeam Game 131: 8/26 — 2-5, 1 HR, 2 RBI, 1 R, 1 K\nMcGwire moved to 54 homers through 133 team games, with just another mammoth shot off of Justin Speier:\n\nThis two-run homer put the Cardinals up 3-0, but this game actually featured a tremendous St. Louis collapse. The Cards expanded the lead to 6-0 by the end of the eighth, but below it all in the ninth. John Frascatore allowed three consecutive solo home runs to open the final frame, and Jeff Brantley came on to give up a game-tying three-run homer to then-rookie/current A’s manager Mark Kotsay. The Marlins would go on to win 7-6 in extras. \nSammy Sosa through Game 133 of 1998: 52 HR\nTeam Game 133: 8/26 — 1-for-5, 1 HR, 1 R, 1 RBI, 3 K\nSosa and McGwire were even in team games played at this point, and Sosa kept pace, smashing a solo homer of his own, a no-doubter to left off of Brett Tomko:\n\nIt wasn’t a great game otherwise for Sosa, but no matter, the fans were there to see dingers.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3622843-dods-toxic-liabilities-will-adversely-affect-recruiting/",
        "description": "A whopping $280 billion over 10 years — that’s the estimated cost of the recent PACT Act legislation addressing the wreckage caused to our service members by toxic exposure and war zone burn pits — the areas for disposing of human, medical, materiel and vehicular waste on the battlefield. This cost does not include potential liability from civil lawsuits for the 1 million people allegedly exposed to toxic water contamination at Camp Lejeune from August 1953 to December 1987, nor does it include the potential liability from lawsuits for the water contamination from the Red Hill fuel farm or the “forever chemical” known as PFAS.\n\n\n\nTo put this dollar amount into perspective, the PACT Act alone is almost enough to pay for half of the nuclear triad modernization. If an organization was hit with a bill this large, one would expect them to take immediate action to stop further exposures. However, in our system of government, the Department of Defense (DOD) will never see most of these bills. This is because the appropriations do not come out of DOD’s yearly funds, which effectively shields the department from the monetary consequences of its actions. While it is a moral imperative for our government to take care of those suffering from these past poisonings, the larger question is: What will we do to protect our military members and families from being poisoned in the future?\n\n\n\nAlmost as important for the DOD is assessing the impact on recruiting and current warfighting readiness. The military faces a deep recruiting crisis, and poisoning your employees and their families is not an effective recruiting technique. The DOD’s recent “propensity to serve” survey, which reflects data from the fall of 2021, shows that the propensity to serve by males has hit a low of 11 percent. When asked why they would not serve, the possibility of physical injury or death was in the top 10 reasons for 65 percent of respondents. While many may shrug this off as fear of combat, the number of potential recruits familiar with the long-term health effects of burn pits and other service-related illnesses is rapidly rising.\n\n\n\nThere are three things that DOD can do immediately to begin to address this ongoing crisis.\n\n\n\nFirst, settle the Lejeune lawsuits quickly. In the PACT Act, Congress authorized over 1 million people to sue the military for the toxic exposure at Camp Lejeune. Litigation lawyers are running ads online, on television, and in print. The bombardment of these ads, along with a long public trial, could cause lasting damage to the entire military recruiting effort. And it is critical that lawmakers be prepared for sticker shock on the bill, which could total over $10 billion, if 10 percent of the affected million people receive $100,000 each.\n\n\n\nNext, solve the war zone burn pits issue immediately. Besides the moral imperative of protecting military members, whatever the cost of alternatively disposing of the trash, it will be much less expensive than continued lawsuits and costs from future toxic exposure. It may not be easy to find a better solution for waste disposal on the battlefield, but we now know how deadly the release of burnt toxic gasses is. Investing research and development funding in healthy disposal methods will sustain troops longer, keep them healthier, and save lives and costs.\n\n\n\nLastly, the DOD must confront decades of loose environmental standards on its installations, such as not modernizing Hawaii’s fuel tanks or using PFAS. While the DOD, at this point, is immune from PFAS lawsuits, given that Congress only allowed lawsuits concerning Camp Lejeune, it may be only a matter of time before such lawsuits are authorized as well. How many more problems similar to those with the Red Hill fuel tanks exist within the DOD? And how can the department afford the negative publicity each time it exposes people to toxic chemicals? This will continue to be a slow drip that eats away at the credibility of military readiness.\n\n\n\nFor decades, the DOD has shielded itself in secrecy and sovereign immunity as a way to claim national security exemptions from ever-more stringent environmental standards. While this may have been expedient and less costly, the American people are no longer tolerant of environmental degradation and, as we are seeing in Hawaii, military families are no longer willing to accept being poisoned without speaking up. Perhaps this is one reason that the recent Military Family Advocacy Network survey showed a steep decline of military and veteran families recommending military life, a drop from 74.5 percent in 2019 to only 62.9 percent in 2021. \n\n\n\nNot being able to recruit military members puts our nation at risk, and if those in service won’t recommend the job, who will? To prevent future health and environmental disasters that harm military recruiting and ruin American lives, the DOD needs to immediately invest in serious research to solve the problem.\n\n\n\nMaj.

        "description": "Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Bucs had a few bright spots from the youngsters but stll ended up with a loss.  The Pittsburgh Pirates lost another one to the Toronto Blue Jays on Saturday by a 4-1 score, but they did get some positive play from a few of their young pieces. \nOneil Cruz got the scoring started with an RBI triple in the bottom of the third to give Pittsburgh a 1-0 lead. \n\n\nOneil Cruz hits another TRIPLE to give the Pirates the lead! #LetsGoBucs #Pirates #MLB pic.twitter.com/0nJ4LZtETo— Baseball Today (@dailymlbtweets) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nRoansy Contreras got the start and was effective, going six innings and giving up just one run on four hits with five strikeouts and two walks. He got the no decision after leaving with the game tied and the bottom fell out immediate after he left, with Duane Underwood Jr. loading the bags and then giving up a bases clearing double to Bo Bichette to round out the scoring. \nThe Pirates had a chance in the top of the fifth for some runs with two on and nobody out, but Cruz struck out and Kevin Newman grounded into a double play to end the threat. \nCruz was your only multi-hit Bucco on the day, finishing 2-for-4, and the team finished with just seven hits, were struck out 13 times and were 0-for-5 with runners in scoring position. \nIt’s worth noting that Pittsburgh’s 464 runs on the season is only third worst in the Majors this year, which is incredible considering the futility we’ve seen at the plate this season. Every other night seems to be a shutout or a one-run game for the Bucs. Imagine watching the Oakland Athletics or Detroit Tigers hit this season. They’ve scored 452 and 438 runs respectively. \nThe Bucs are back at it this afternoon and will look to avoid being swept.",

        "description": "Ryan Mountcastle was having a good time after his second home run of the game. | Photo by Mitchell Layton/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Orioles have gained no ground in the wild card while winning the first two games against Oakland. They go for a sweep today. Hello, friends.\nFor the nervous among us, the Orioles home series against the Athletics seemed to have all the hallmarks of a potential trap series - one where everyone’s already looking ahead to the crucial coming four games against the Blue Jays and instead they slip up and lose games they shouldn’t against a bad team. Fortunately, the first two games against the Athletics have been just the opposite, with the O’s taking care of business.\nSaturday’s win felt more like what the Orioles should be doing against Oakland. They stomped on a subpar pitching staff, combining to hit five home runs on the way to an 8-1 victory. Encouraging was seeing Ryan Mountcastle with two of the homers. If he’s breaking out of his July/August slump down the stretch, that should be good news for the O’s and their fans.\nRegrettably for the Orioles, as they’ve beaten the A’s these last two days, they’ve gotten no help from teams playing their wild card competitors. The Jays, Rays, and Mariners were all winners on both Friday and Saturday. The Orioles, despite going 7-3 in their last ten games, have lost a game to each of the Rays and Mariners in that time, and they’ve only gained one game on the Blue Jays. It is annoying. They remain 1.5 games back of Toronto for the final AL wild card spot.\nIf there’s any consolation to be had while this is going on, it’s that the Yankees are in a free fall. The AL East leaders once had a 23 game advantage over the Orioles that’s down to 7.5 games - fewer than eight games for the first time since April. The Rays, who’ve beaten the Yankees the last two days, are now within four games of the division lead. It would be pretty freaking hilarious if the Yankees have that collapse, and honestly, the O’s are 3.5 back of the Rays with the Rays holding the tiebreaker, so there’s little hope of passing them anyway.\nThe Orioles need to once again take care of business against this poor quality Athletics team by finishing up with a sweep today. Spenser Watkins is set to start the 1:35 finale for the O’s, with Adrián Martínez taking the mound for Oakland. Elsewhere in MLB, Toronto plays its finale against Pittsburgh starting at 12:05, the Rays and Yankees start at 1:40, and the Guardians and Mariners get under way at 2:40. It would really be nice for the Pirates to win one.\nAround the blogO’sphere\nOrioles claim Anthony Castro, designate Phoenix Sanders (MLBTR)Even with the Orioles doing what they’re doing, Mike Elias is tinkering on the edges of the 40-man roster trying to find relievers who might be able to be polished into capable players next year.\nThe 2019 draft picks all in the same lineup and Chirinos celebrates a milestone (Steve Melewski)One noteworthy thing yesterday is that Adley Rutschman, Gunnar Henderson, and Kyle Stowers all being in the same lineup marked the same time the Orioles ever had their top three picks from one draft class in the same lineup. Another: Robinson Chirinos hit the 10 years of MLB service time mark.\nBrandon Hyde should lock up AL Manager of the Year (The Athletic)Dan Connolly thinks that there’s nothing left to decide for manager of the year. I hope the Orioles keep playing in such a way to make that a no-brainer by season’s end.\nBirthdays and Orioles anniversaries\nThere are a few former Orioles who were born on this day. They are: 2002/04 infielder Luis López, 1972-76 pitcher Doyle Alexander, and 1954-55 first baseman Eddie Waitkus.\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday to you! Your birthday buddies for today include: composer Anton Bruckner (1824), actress Khandi Alexander (1957), actor Damon Wayans (1960), singer-songwriter Beyoncé (1981), and wrestler Xavier Woods (1986).\nOn this day in history...\nIn 1666, the five-day Great Fire of London suffered what turned out to be its worst day, destroying St. Paul’s Cathedral and jumping outside of the medieval walls, where it had been contained up to that point, and across the Fleet River.\nIn 1781, Spanish settlers founded El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora La Reina de los Ángeles. The city that remains around the spot chosen by those 44 people today has since dropped a lot of the words and is now simply Los Angeles.\nIn 1870, France’s Emperor Napoleon III, nephew of the most famous Napoleon, was deposed following France’s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, after which the Third French Republic was proclaimed. This republic lasted until France fell to the Nazis in World War II. They’re on the Fifth French Republic now.\nIn 1972, The Price is Right premiered. Four years ago, this became the longest-running game show in America. The next-closest to Price is Wheel of Fortune, which has been running continuously since 1983.\n**\nAnd that’s the way it is in Birdland on September 4. Have a safe Sunday. Go O’s!",

This is a moment to throw old political assumptions out the window and to consider that Democrats could buck historic trends this cycle…”\n\n\n\n“With over two months until Election Day, uncertainty abounds. Election prognostication relies heavily on past precedent. Yet there is no precedent for an election centered around the removal of a constitutional right affirmed a half-century before. Every poll we consume over the closing weeks of this election will rely on a likely voter model for which we have no benchmark.”",

        "title": "Yeti Coolers Are Luxury Goods for Bros",
        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/yeti-drink-cooler-popularity-status-symbol/671335/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "Two months ago, I received a text describing a situation that I could see immediately and with full clarity in my mind’s eye. “All these guys on this bachelor party brought their own Yetis,” my friend David wrote. “We have seven Yetis for ten people.” The party was at a house on Lake Norman, in North Carolina, and although the Yeti-to-bro ratio was later revised down to six Yetis for 12 bros, my vision for what was happening was clear. Sun. Boats. Beers. Just guys being dudes.A Yeti, for the uninitiated, is a cooler made by the Austin, Texas–based company of the same name. But it’s not just any cooler. The brand’s acolytes—and there are many—will take seemingly any opportunity to tell you that Yetis are the best, coldest coolers that money can buy. With prices starting at $250 for enough space to get a small cookout drunk and ranging up to $1,500 for one so enormous, it could be used to cater an outdoor wedding, the coolers aren’t cheap. Yeti fans’ enthusiasm can be hard to argue with, though, not least of which because you probably don’t know anything about coolers. I, for example, do not.Nevertheless, that has not stopped the company’s products—first hard-sided coolers, and now insulated backpacks, water bottles, and cocktail glasses, as well as other outdoorsy gear—from becoming unexpectedly resonant status symbols. Yeti has the kind of sales growth that would make any Silicon Valley venture capitalist soil their pants: In 2011, five years after the company was founded, it did $29 million in sales, according to Yeti. By 2021, the company had gone public and had $1.4 billion in annual revenue. That success has been built on well-liked products, yes, but any successful branding exercise is just as much philosophical as functional. Yeti’s philosophical bet seems to be that we’d all like to spend more time outside with our bros, and that, deep down, maybe there’s a little bit of bro in all of us.Yeti’s own description of its target market doesn’t actually include the word bro. The company began with hunters and fishermen—both pros and hobbyists—as its first fans. Selling expensive, high-performance gear to sportsmen is a well-established (if niche) market, and by Yeti’s account, it had an opening. “There wasn’t a cooler that would let you stay out and fish longer,” Paulie Dery, Yeti’s chief marketing officer, told me. “And then the lids broke when you stepped on them to try and use them as casting platforms.”[Read: The package is the message]The company seems to have genuinely solved both of these problems. With nothing in it, one of its midsize Tundra coolers weighs in at a decidedly sturdy 23 pounds. I’ve seen them used as benches and step stools by people of all sizes and levels of backyard intoxication. And—with apologies for how much saying that a product performed its most basic function as promised sounds like an advertisement—I’ve also opened one in a friend’s apartment, several days after the party for which it was used, and found ice that was only semi-melted and drinks that were still pretty frosty. Earlier this summer, the financial-news website Motley Fool worried that Yeti’s products might actually be too good to make its stock a sound long-term investment, because its coolers and other gear don’t need to be replaced regularly.So far, at least, that hasn’t been a problem. Dery reiterated to me several times that the company’s products are still designed to be durable enough for fishing, hunting, and farmwork, and that the company’s advertising targets people who are serious about the outdoors. Indeed, Yeti has become a fascination in the world of branding for its under-the-radar approach. The company focuses its event-marketing and celebrity-endorsement dollars on things such as college fishing tournaments and rock-climbing national championships, and it signs rodeo champions and barbecue pitmasters largely unknown outside their disciplines. This approach doesn’t immediately seem like it would attract a wide audience of people who spend their life mostly indoors, but associations with aspirational kinds of skill and expertise have a way of lending credibility that’s enticing to people who don’t know how to cast a fly rod or ride a horse or light a grill. Maybe they want to learn on their next vacation. Might as well start by buying the gear.And those other customers have found the company and filled its coffers. First, they were in places like Denver and Nashville—cities and their suburbs with proximity to outdoor activities and with populations of hobbyist sportsmen. But now, Dery said, the brand has begun to see significant sales growth in coastal urban areas, which don’t exactly fit that mold. This trend tracks my own perception: In the 2010s, my friends in Georgia, where I grew up and went to a college that takes tailgating very seriously, started buying Yeti coolers to christen the backyards of newly purchased first homes, or to upgrade their college-football setups for a new season. More recently, though, my friends in New York City, where I now live, seem aware of—and interested in—the brand’s products. And although Yeti has thus far eschewed traditional celebrity spokespeople, A-listers such as Julia Roberts and Matt Damon are apparent fans. I didn’t see this twist coming.How a Texas brand goes from a small audience of dedicated fishermen to a broader audience of largely middle- and upper-middle-class white men in the South isn’t an impossible puzzle to solve. Lots of brands that sell premium-tier outdoorsiness, such as Patagonia and Arc’teryx, have jumped from America’s avid hikers, skiers, and climbers to broader success among the well-paid, outdoor-dabbling office workers adjacent to those groups. How Yeti went from hunters and fishermen to Sun Belt Millennial dads to New Yorkers throwing rooftop parties or carrying their coffee to work on the subway, though, is a little more interesting. The market for insulated beverage containers is already crowded, and in the United States, consumer influence tends to flow in somewhat predictable directions. I’ve not noticed any Brooklynites who work at digital-marketing agencies stocking up on Columbia fishing shirts or Titleist caps. They generally want different things out of their clothing and personal effects, with rare overlaps, such as the workwear brand Carhartt, which—tale as old as time—needed the coolness sign-off of influential rappers in the 1990s before fashion-conscious white New Yorkers eventually took notice.[Read: Fashion has abandoned human taste]The key to the whole phenomenon might be in my friend’s text about all the bros who showed up with their Yetis, ready to keep their bros’ beers frosty all weekend. People love—and have been socialized—to mark milestones with objects. Buying something that costs a few hundred bucks and is supposed to last a lifetime hits a price-quality sweet spot for a lot of young-ish professionals who want a marker or two of domestic stability and success to display in their home—or, in the case of a fancy cooler, to bring out to entertain their friends at parties, or to make sure your bros have cold drinks at the lake.Unlike most other types of outdoor gear that can be repurposed into urban life—parkas, cold-weather boots, lightweight backpacks—coolers are communal, their contents are often fun, and they don’t actually suggest that you want to do anything that causes you to break a sweat or chafe your inner thighs or maybe fall off the side of a mountain. Bros, who seem to be the people who have embraced Yeti’s products most ardently, aren’t consigned to any particular region of the country, and they love to go outside and sit down or stand behind a grill. The word bro can have some negative connotations, but I like it best as a largely gender-neutral descriptor of a person who is affable, doesn’t take themselves too seriously, and is—and this is crucial—a good hang. Everyone loves the person who shows up to the party with a cooler full of drinks that won’t return to room temperature for days, and you don’t even have to catch any fish or learn how to ski.",

        "description": "Josh Fogg may have been the Rockies&#8217; &#8220;Dragon Slayer&#8221; during their Rocktober run to the 2007 World Series, but he never could neutralize Albert Pujols.\nAt age 42, in his swan song season with the Cardinals, Pujols entered the weekend only six home runs away from entering a baseball galaxy where few have ever soared. Only Barry Bonds (762), Henry Aaron (755) and Babe Ruth (714) have hit 700 home runs. Of Pujols&#8217; 694 career homers, three came off of Fogg.\n&#8220;He only hit three homers off me? Only three? It felt like a heck of a lot more than that,&#8221; Fogg said with a chuckle.\nFor the record, Pujols was 13-for-33 (.394) off Fogg, with four doubles in addition to the three dingers.\n&#8220;I was a righty, he hits righty,&#8221; Fogg said. &#8220;You&#8217;d think I might have an advantage. I never had an advantage against Albert.&#8221;\nFogg, who lives in Tampa, Fla., helps coach his 15-year-old son Koy&#8217;s high school baseball team. This year, Pujols became a topic of discussion.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m working with the pitchers, and everybody&#8217;s first question is, &#8216;Who&#8217;s the toughest guy you ever faced,&#8221; Fogg said. &#8220;So I list off some guys: Barry Bonds, I got him out a bunch. Ken Griffey Jr. got some homers off me. But Albert Pujols was the toughest hitter I faced.&#8221;\nThe kids shake their heads in disbelief.\n&#8220;They go, &#8216;Really? Albert Pujols?&#8217; &#8221; Fogg said with a laugh. &#8220;They see Albert now and they see the old man. But I tell them, &#8216;You don&#8217;t understand, for a 10-year period he was probably better than anybody in the history of the game.&#8221;\nPujols made his major league debut against the Rockies on April 2, 2001, at Coors Field. He was 21. He started in left field and was 1-for-3, getting his first big-league knock off Rockies left-hander Mike Hampton &#8212; a single to left field in the seventh inning. The Rockies won 8-0.\nSince then, Pujols has homered off 450 different pitchers in the regular season, in 40 different parks, with 12 walk-off home runs to serve as memory markers.\nPujols has launched home runs off 24 different Rockies pitchers and he&#8217;s hit 13 out at Coors Field. It seems as if it should have been more, especially considering that he hit five homers against Colorado &#8212; three at Coors Field — in 2001 when he put together one of the greatest rookie seasons in history. He hit .329 with 47 doubles, 37 homers, 130 RBIs and 112 runs scored.\nBut after 11 years in the majors, Pujols left St. Louis and the National League in December 2011, signing a 10-year, $254 million contract with the Angels. His chances to rake off Rockies pitchers and watch his homers soar into Denver&#8217;s mile-high sky were greatly diminished.\nNevertheless, specific Pujols home runs are burned into the brains of Rockies pitchers. Following are four of those pitchers and their memories.\nJosh Fogg, July 21, 2002, PNC Park\nOK, Fogg was a rookie pitching for the Pirates at the time, so this Pujols homer didn&#8217;t come when Fogg was wearing Colorado purple. But Pujols&#8217; 60th career homer is too good a story to pass up.\nThe Cardinals were consistently beating the Pirates and manager Lloyd McClendon was sick to death of it. He was particularly sick of the Pirates getting clubbed by outfielder Jim Edmonds and, of course, Pujols.\nEdmonds had singled off Fogg in the first inning, so McClendon had a serious pow-wow with Fogg in the dugout.\n&#8220;McClendon said, &#8216;If Edmonds comes up and there&#8217;s anybody on base, just hit the (blankity-blank). He&#8217;s killing us,&#8217; &#8221; recalled Fogg.\nIn the third inning, Placido Palanco hit a one-out double, leaving first base open. So veteran Pirates catcher Jason Kendall signaled for Fogg to plunk Edmonds. The problem was that Edmonds dodged three inside fastballs.\n&#8220;So Edmonds steps out of the box and gives me this bad look,&#8221; Fogg continued. &#8220;But then, Lloyd McClendon, from the dugout, yells, &#8216;Geeze, if you can&#8217;t hit him, just walk him then!&#8217; &#8221;\nAt that point, Edmonds turned his anger from Fogg to McClendon and the two had a confrontation near home plate. Kendall grabbed Lloyd and Fogg grabbed Edmonds. A brouhaha was close to breaking out.\n&#8220;So here I am, restraining the guy I just tried to hit,&#8221; Fogg said. &#8220;I&#8217;m just a rookie, but I&#8217;m saying, &#8216;Hey Jimmy, it&#8217;s fine, no worries.&#8217; But Edmonds screams, &#8216;Shut the (blank) up rookie!&#8217; So I lose my mind and now I&#8217;m trying to kill Edmonds.&#8221;\nThe benches and bullpens emptied but there were no punches thrown and there were no ejections. When some semblance of order was restored, Fogg threw ball four to intentionally walk Edmonds.\n&#8220;So, who do you think comes up?&#8221; Fogg asked. &#8220;Of course, Albert Pujols. But I think I&#8217;m just going to blow him away because I&#8217;ve got all of this energy boiling inside me.\n&#8220;I threw a two-seamer down and in, thinking I&#8217;m going to get a double-play ball. I probably threw it about 86 and he hit it about 450 feet to left field.&#8221;\nJason Jennings, July 25, 2006, Coors Field\n&#8220;It&#8217;s a homer I&#8217;ll never forget until the day I die,&#8221; Jennings said of Pujols&#8217; 234th career homer.\nOn that particular day, Jennings was matched up against Cardinals right-hander Chris Carpenter, the 2005 NL Cy Young Award winner. Jennings was brilliant, throwing nine innings of four-hit baseball with four strikeouts and one walk. But the Rockies lost, 1-0, on Pujols&#8217; two-out homer to right field in the sixth inning on a 1-1 count. \n&#8220;It was one of the best changeups I ever threw to a right-handed hitter,&#8221; Jennings recalled. &#8220;Somehow, that guy hit it into the first couple of rows above the scoreboard in right field.\n&#8220;I had really good stuff that day. I threw him a changeup down and away, I don&#8217;t know how he hit it out. Let me put it this way. There was no other right-hander that I ever faced, that could have hit that pitch, in that location, out of the ballpark. It just didn&#8217;t happen.\n&#8220;I just have to tip my cap to him because I don&#8217;t think I would have done anything differently. He was just that good.&#8221;\nJason Hirsh, May 30, 2007, Coors Field\nThe Rockies were attempting to win eight games in a row for the first time since Aug. 26-Sept. 2, 1997. Pujols had other plans, smacking career home run No. 259.\n&#8220;I remember it well,&#8221; Hirsh said. &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t landed yet.&#8221;\nIn the top of the third, Pujols hit a pop foul near the visitor&#8217;s dugout at Coors.\n&#8220;I screamed, &#8216;Stay fair! Stay fair!&#8217; &#8221; Hirsh recalled.\nThe ball did stay fair and Rockies third baseman Garrett Atkins pocketed it for the out.\nNo big deal, right? Wrong.\n&#8220;In the dugout (outfielder) Willie Taveres &#8212; he was pretty tight with Pujols &#8212; says to me, &#8216;What did you say to Albert? He&#8217;s really (ticked) off,&#8217; &#8221; Hirsh recalled. &#8220;He must have thought I said something completely different, I&#8217;m not sure what.&#8221;\nIn the fifth, Pujols came up with two on base and no out. He obliterated Hirsh&#8217;s first pitch, sending it to deep left-center field for a three-run blast.\n&#8220;I swear he walked three-quarters up the first baseline, staring me down,&#8221; Hirsh said.\nTo add pain to injury, Edmonds hit Hirsh’s very next pitch over the fence. Hirsh was done, having given up eight runs on 10 hits.\nAustin Gomber, Aug. 18, 2022, Busch Stadium\nGomber, pitching in relief of fellow left-hander Kyle Freeland, had served up Pujols&#8217; career homer No. 687 at Coors Field eight days earlier in St. Louis&#8217; 9-5 victory.\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; doubleheader split at Cincinnati leaves them with 3-7 road trip\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSaunders: Truth is, Nolan Arenado was too good for the Rockies\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRoad-kill Rockies lose in walk-off fashion to Reds\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSpencer Strider strikes out 16 Rockies in Braves&#8217; 3-0 win\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRookie Michael Toglia homers, but Rockies lose to Braves\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\nThe homer he served up at Busch Stadium, No. 690, was a doozy.\nGomber replaced starter Antonio Senzatela in the second inning when Senzatela went down with what turned out to be a season-ending knee injury. In the third, with the bases loaded and two outs, Pujols entered the game as a pinch hitter.\nHe demolished Gomber&#8217;s 1-0 fastball for a grand slam. It was Pujols&#8217; 16th career grand slam, but his first as a pinch hitter. His 16 slams put him in elite company, tying him with Aaron, Ruth and Dave Kingman for 10th all-time.\n&#8220;First and foremost, it&#8217;s cool to face a guy like that, somebody who’s been in the league since I was 7 years old,&#8221; a philosophical Gomber said. &#8220;Looking back, later in life, it will be more of a big deal than it is to me right now.&#8221;\nBut being part of Pujols&#8217; quest for the magic 700 is not lost on Gomber.\n&#8220;To be an unfortunate part of his history is just part of the game,&#8221; Gomber said. &#8220;I mean, the guy has hit almost 700 homers and more than 400 guys have given them up, right?

        "description": "Photo by David J. Griffin/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Colorado Rockies news and links for Sunday, September 4, 2022 In the midst of another losing season, it’s tough to find reasons to be excited to watch the Colorado Rockies. The team has struggled mightily throughout the season offensively, defensively, and even on the mound. Injuries limited their shiny free agent to 40 games and decimated their pitching staff depth. General apathy has bubbled to the surface for many frustrated fans and for good reason, it’s tough to watch a team that can make you miserable. \nHowever, the one thing that I look forward to every September is the chance to see new faces get a chance in the big leagues. The season is out of hand and therefore you can afford to shuffle things around and give guys a chance because what do you have to lose otherwise? The Rockies have seemingly taken this thought process to heart finally and are giving the kids a chance to play. \nElehuris Montero\nThe big league journey for Elehuris Montero has been shaky and inconsistent in 2022. After several call-ups throughout the season, the Rockies would commit only sporadic playing time to one of their top prospects. After getting called up at the beginning of August, the Rockies finally committed to allowing Montero to play consistently and regularly. \nSince the start of August, Montero has started 22 of the 23 games he has played in. During that stretch, he has batted .268/.286/.512 with 22 hits, including four home runs, in 84 plate appearances. Strikeouts are a big problem for Montero at the moment with 24 punchouts to just one walk, but these are the times to let him work through it and figure out his approach at the big league levels. We know the potential his bat has, and we’ve seen the power of display when he cranks one out. \nIt’s also a good chance for him to work on his glovework. The story for Montero each time he has been called up this season was to get plenty of work with the big league coaches when it came to defensive work. He has split time between the corner infield positions, giving the Rockies a chance to see home comfortable he is there, especially at first base where he could see more playing time. Either way, the chance to get into a routine day in and day out will do wonders for Montero as he preps for next season. \nMichael Toglia\nEarlier this week we were surprised by the news that the Rockies would be promoting Michael Toglia to the big leagues. Often thought of as the first baseman of the future, Toglia impressed during his short stint in Triple-A and the Rockies felt it was time for the kid to make his debut. He has started in all four games since his call-up, mostly playing in right field to work on his utility since that would be a spot for him in 2023. So far, he is batting just .214/.214/.500 in a measly 14 at-bats. At times you’ve seen the influence that Todd Helton has had on the young man during his at-bats. \nToglia getting playing time is essential for his growth and a movement towards the reboot the Rockies need. He’s already got his first big fly out the way and has shown good instincts defensively at both first base and the outfield. He only has four strikeouts thus far and no walks, but with more reps, we can begin to get more of a complete picture of what he can do. I’ve been excited to watch each at-bat for Toglia, just to see his growth and hoping that he can hit a bomb somewhere. \nSean Bouchard\nCalled up once more at the same time as Toglia, Sean Bouchard is aiming to make the most of his second promotion to the big leagues this season. The injury of Kris Bryant comes with a silver lining as it is giving the Rockies a chance to give Bouchard an extended look in the outfield. \nHe has also played in four games since his promotion and has been a pleasant surprise. In 14 plate appearances across those games, Bouchard is batting .273./.429/.546 with only three hits, including his first home run as a big leaguer. He has shown some good plate discipline, drawing three walks, while striking out just four times. If the Rockies feel he has performed well enough, he may find himself as a replacement for Connor Joe on the roster, as they are basically built in the same mold. Regardless, it’s nice to see a surprise in the form of Bouchard who is putting together some nice defensive plays and quality at-bats.\nJustin Lawrence\nThe bullpen has been an area of stress this season, but the Rockies are getting a boost from Justin Lawrence. The sidearm fireballer has been one of the relievers that have been on a sporadic schedule this season. He has been towed back and forth between Triple-A and the major leagues quite a bit, but since his call-up on August 13, he has been one of the team’s best relievers. In 10 2⁄3 innings of work, Lawrence has pitched himself to a 1.69 ERA, 1.62 FIP, and struck out 14 batters to just four walks. \nHe has shown improved command with his pitches and Bud Black is handing him the ball in key situations when the Rockies need to lock down an inning. He has the potential to be a true lockdown presence in the bullpen next year if he can keep it up. If you are going to promote young arms, you have to use them and give them confidence that they can stick with the team. \nThe future is now\nIt has happened later than any of us hoped, but the Rockies are starting to promote and utilize young stars that are meant to carry the next generation of Rockies baseball. Perhaps there is a chance we see even more players this month, such as Coco Montes, and that is something to be excited about this month.\nWhen you do the same thing over and over with the same players, you’re going to get the same results. We are seeing a surge of young, exciting prospects make their debuts this season. We’ve seen exciting ones in MLB just this past week. The Rockies are trying to follow suit and they will be better off if they start letting the young kids play and succeed. \n★ ★ ★\nFeltner is a student of his own arsenal | MLB.com\nWe sometimes talk about the need for more analytics and research from the Colorado Rockies, but there is a lot of work that individual players put in for themselves in order to try and improve. Thomas Harding caught up with Ryan Feltner to talk about his preparation and due diligence when it comes to preparing for each new start. Feltner details what he tries to do and what he strives to learn from each outing and from each pitch. \n★ ★ ★\nOn The Farm\n\nTriple-A: Albuquerque Isotopes @ Sugar Land Space Cowboys  (Canceled due to rain)\n\nDouble-A: Reading Fightin Phils 3, Hartford Yard Goats 1\nThe match-up between Reading and Hartford was the MiLB spotlight of the week, and it certainly lived up to the billing of being a quality ball game. Noah Davis started on the hill for Hartford, turning in one of his best outings of the season, going seven innings and allowing one run on four hits while striking out eight. Blair Calvo was tagged with the loss after giving up two runs in the top of the ninth to give reading the deciding victory. The Yard Goats had 10 hits, but couldn’t capitalize on scoring opportunities. Willie MacIver went 3-for-3 on the night, while Hunter Stovall had two hits before he was ejected in the third inning. \nHigh-A: Vancouver Canadians 7, Spokane Indians 6\nExtra-innings did not go Spokane’s way as they lost 7-6 Saturday night. Case Williams lasted  4 2⁄3 on the mound, giving up five runs on nine hits before Anderson Pilar went 3 1⁄3  innings in relief. Juan Mejia took the loss after allowing one run in two innings. Offensively, Spokane saw Ronaiker Palma produce a four-hit night and drive in a pair, while Braiden Ward, Robby Martin Jr., and Colin Simpson each had multi-hit evenings. In total, Spokane had 12 hits but struck out 15 times. \nLow-A: Fresno Grizzlies 12, Modesto Nuts 5\nThe Fresno Grizzlies kept rolling as they threw out 12 runs on 13 hits over the Modesto Nuts. Juan Brito led the way with three hits and three RBI. Sterlin Thompson added a two-hit night and scored a pair of runs along with EJ Andrew’s two hits to drive in three runs. The Grizzlies utilized a pitch by committee approach, starting with two innings by McCade Brown in which he allowed two runs. Sergio Sanchez ended up with the save after tossing 3 1⁄3 innings, allowing just one hit and striking out two. \n★ ★ ★\nPlease keep in mind our Purple Row Community Guidelines when you’re commenting.

        "description": "Royal Albert Hall, LondonPetrenko proved his mastery of Mahler’s Seventh yet again as he brought out its lurking ambiguity in a performance that hovered between dream and nightmareMahler’s Seventh Symphony was the single work given by the Berlin Philharmonic in the first of their two Proms, a riveting performance under Kirill Petrenko, for whom, one suspects, this most enigmatic of the composer’s symphonies holds considerable significance. In 2018, a year before he took up his post in Berlin, he conducted it with his previous orchestra, the Bayerische Staatsoper, both in Munich and in London, and his live recording (made during the Munich performances), was widely regarded as something of a benchmark that subjected the work to a revelatory re-evaluation. This Proms performance reinforced his reputation as one of the symphony’s outstanding interpreters in a concert of startling brilliance.Petrenko is wonderfully alert to the fact that ambiguity of expression is fundamental to the work’s impact. No other Mahler symphony demands quite such painstaking attention to instrumental and textural detail in music that seems to resist meaning and hovers in ambivalent territory between dream and nightmare, illusion and reality. A sense of impending fragmentation or dissolution underlies it, and it’s no wonder that some – including Schoenberg, who adored it – saw it as marking the beginning of musical modernism. Two nocturnes flanking a spectral scherzo-cum-waltz form the work’s kernel, their sinister magic superbly captured here in playing of great clarity, with a lustre of tone in the strings, astonishing brass and slithering woodwind solos that were utterly beguiling, but beyond which also lurked a sense of disquiet and dread.

On Saturdays, hanging out with my pals in HMV, I didn’t find his music when I slipped quietly into the classical section. Nor did I encounter him when I studied for a music degree, or during a career dedicated to early music.And yet Lusitano was the first Black composer to have his music published. I first saw his name during the summer of 2020’s Black Lives Matter protests, when flautist and composer Alice H Jones tweeted a picture of the placard she had carried with her to a protest in New York City: a list of Black classical composers and their dates, starting with Lusitano, who, in the middle of the 16th century, predated the “first” acknowledged Black composer – Ignatius Sancho – in any music history I knew by more than 200 years: “I brought my music classroom to a protest today,” tweeted Jones. Three thousand miles away, I sat down and learned. Continue reading...",

        "description": "It’s a monstrous thought, but politicians who disparage net zero as a ‘new religion’ and wind power as ‘medieval’ are tipped for cabinet postsWhat a strange, heady, anxious summer that was. For all the talk by many journalists and politicians about the cost of living crisis as something that will decisively arrive in the autumn, it is already here. At the same time, the landscape of this small corner of northern Europe is parched and straw-coloured, while those terrifying images of flooding in Pakistan have illustrated the climate emergency’s even more nightmarish flipside. The pandemic, it turns out, was merely one more crisis on the way to something completely convulsive: payback for our fragile dependence on fossil fuels, and a way of living that is no longer sustainable. With perfect timing, next weekend will see the return to London’s streets of Extinction Rebellion, whose protests will trigger the usual sneers from climate deniers while hammering home 2022’s awful sense of urgency.Meanwhile, as if the immediate future is being decided by a TV scriptwriter who specialises in the bleakest comedy, Liz Truss is seemingly about to move into Downing Street, after two months of surreal and largely pointless debate in which the climate crisis has barely figured. She and Rishi Sunak may have paid lip service to the government’s nominal target of achieving net zero by 2050 – but, whatever their other differences, they have largely spoken with one voice on climate policy: the cursory, slightly bored tone of people who think of it as an optional extra.John Harris is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/education/3627156-ron-desantiss-genius-plan-to-solve-the-teacher-shortage-crisis/",
        "description": "While much of cable news is still fixated on the FBI raid of Mar-a-Lago, there are two joint crises happening that most journalists are ignoring: the shortages of police officers and teachers, which threaten America’s public safety and education system.In New York City, for example, more than 1,500 police officers have handed in their resignations or retired, with some leaving the force before being eligible for their full pensions. It’s an unprecedented pace, marking the largest exodus on record, according to the New York Post. Similar percentages are seen in other major U.S. cities.\n\n\n\n“A survey of about 200 police departments indicates that retirements were up by 45 percent and resignations by 18 percent in the period between April 2020 and April 2021,\" reported the New York Times last summer.On the teacher front, matters are even more dire. Some Texas school districts have had to shorten their school week to four days a week. The reason? Not enough teachers. In Arizona, college students are now being hired to instruct children.\n\n\n\n“I have never seen it this bad. Right now [the teacher shortage] is number one on the list of issues that are concerning school districts,” observed Dan Domenech, executive director of the School Superintendents Association, in an August interview with the Washington Post.The reflex under the Biden administration and the Democratic-controlled Congress is to throw lots of money at problems to make it appear they're doing something to address them. Want to lower inflation? Sign a $740 billion spending bill and call it the Inflation Reduction Act. But one elected official is taking a proactive approach that won’t break the bank.\n\n\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) Recently announced a proposal to extend hiring bonuses to retired police officers, firefighters, military veterans, first responders and paramedics to address the teacher shortage crisis in the Sunshine State. The governor also announced an initiative to allow these candidates easier access to teaching certificates. The candidates would be required to hold a bachelor’s degree and must commit to teaching for at least two years. The bonuses can be up to $5,000 per candidate.“Our veterans have a wealth of knowledge and experience they can bring to bear in the classroom and with this innovative approach they will be able to do so for five years with a temporary certification as they work towards their degree,” DeSantis explained in announcing the program.“We have people who have served 20 years in law enforcement, who have retired, and some of them are looking for the next chapter in their life,\" he also said. The state of America's education system is increasingly a concern for voters. Exit polls showed education was a top voter priority in Glenn Youngkin’s victory last year in the Virginia gubernatorial race.\n\n\n\nAnd why not? Teacher unions are focusing on critical race theory in our schools that teach children as young as five years old to see others through a racial prism and to judge others by the color of one’s skin rather than the content of their character. We're also teaching kids in elementary school about gender identification and sexual orientation. Most children are not mature enough for these conversations, and parents, not teachers, should be the ones having them anyway. The consequences of this focus are clear. Per the Associated Press, citing a study by the National Center for Education Statistics, a branch of the Education Department: \"Reading scores saw their largest decrease in 30 years, while math scores had their first decrease in the history of the testing regimen behind the study.\" COVID-19 lockdowns and Zoom learning helped drive this number, for sure. But given that the U.S. was already ranked 25th in the world in math, reading and science, this most recent setback is devastating to an already-struggling education system.  In Florida, the vacancies for teachers in the 2021-22 school year resulted in a shortage of more than 9,000 teachers — that means bigger class sizes and less one-on-one instruction. \n\n\n\n“These three initiatives will build on our efforts to increase recruitment and retention of high-quality teachers,” DeSantis also said in announcing his plan. “Great teachers don’t become great teachers because they are sitting in a university lecture hall. What makes a teacher great is being in the classroom, watching other teachers, and seeing what works,\"As for the Biden administration, it announced on Wednesday a partnership with job search firms to make it easier to fill openings in education. The administration will also work with teacher unions to explore ways to expand teacher apprenticeship programs. \n\n\n\nThis is limp window-dressing from Team Biden. More jobs showcased on job portals won’t incentivize those who otherwise aren’t seeking to become teachers to do so.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCheck back in a year to see who had the better solution: DeSantis or Biden. \n\n\n\nBet your kids’ college education on the former.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJoe Concha is a media and politics columnist.",

It was another day, another frustrating loss for the Yankees. Aaron Judge’s ninth inning home run ended up being the only offense in a 2-1 loss to the Rays. That saw the Yankees’ lead over Tampa Bay trimmed even further, now down to just four games.\nHowever, the Rays aren’t the only team chasing the Yankees. Let’s check in on how the rest of the competition did on Saturday in today’s edition of the Rivalry Roundup.\n\nToronto Blue Jays 4 (72-59), Pittsburgh Pirates 1 (49-83)\n\nThe Pirates kept things close for a while, but a three-run seventh inning for Toronto gave them a lead they would hold on to.\nWith the bases loaded with two outs in the seventh, Bo Bichette came up big, bringing home everyone with a double to left.\n\nThat hit would make up for a bunch of other missed chances by the Blue Jays’ offense, who went 1-for-11 with runners in scoring position.\nAfter that, the Pirates, who briefly led 1-0 after an Oneil Cruz RBI triple in the third, had a chance to answer back when they brought the tying run to the plate in the eighth inning. However, they couldn’t cash in that chance and they themselves would finish 0-for-5 with RISP.\n\nSeattle Mariners 4 (75-58), Cleveland Guardians 0 (68-63)\n\nA Ty France home run in the second at-bat of the game gave the Mariners a lead they would never relinquish, as Seattle went on to shutout Cleveland.\nOn the mound, Robbie Ray was good for the Mariners, throwing six scoreless innings, allowing six hits and no walks. After that, Seattle’s bullpen mostly cruised, although Cleveland did briefly fight back in the ninth. Down to their last couple outs, Cleveland put two runners on in the ninth, but ended up failing to get on the board before they could bring a tying run to the plate.\nBeyond France, Mitch Haniger, Cal Raleigh, and J.P. Crawford all recorded RBI as the Mariners did all their work in the first five innings, which ended up to be enough.\n\nLos Angeles Angels 2 (58-75), Houston Astros 1 (85-48)\n\nAt least the Yankees have some company in “losing games to the Angels where your offense does” nothing club. The Astros fell to the Angels in 12 innings, scoring just one run on seven hits, coming on a fifth inning J.J. Matijevic RBI single. That allowed the Angels to rally, tying the game in the seventh, before eventually winning on a 12th inning Matt Duffy walk-off single that just barely evaded a glove.\n\nMuch of the game was a pitchers’ duel between Shohei Ohtani and Luis García, with Ohtani throwing eight innings of one-run ball, and García allowing just one run on three hits in seven frames.\nOnce things got to extra innings, the Angels had a pair of two very good chances, getting the potential winning to third in both the 10th and 11th innings. Yet, it was probably the Astros in the 12th who had the maybe the most brutal failure to score.\nWith runners on the corners and nobody out, David Hensley grounded into a double play. While the runner, catcher Christian Vázquez, isn’t exactly a speed demon, he somehow stuck at third as the double play unfolded instead of scoring, or at the very least trying to. The Astros couldn’t bring him home in the next at-bat, keeping the game tied for the eventual walk-off in the bottom half of the inning.\nOther Contenders\n\nChicago White Sox 13 (67-66), Minnesota Twins 0 (67-64): Dylan Cease was one out away from a no-hitter before the Twins’ Luis Arráez broke it up with a two-out single in the ninth. Cease had to settle for a complete game shutout, having allowed one hit and two walks, with his offense chipping in with a big day.\n\n\nBaltimore Orioles 8 (71-61), Oakland Athletics 1 (49-85): The Orioles scored six runs across the first four innings and never looked back, cruising to a win over the A’s. Ryan Mountcastle led the way for Baltimore, recording two home runs and four RBI.",

        "description": "(Locomotion/Geffen)Despite the serious pose of his eponymous third record, the Doncaster firebrand is best when his tunes are big and brattyOn the surface, this third album from Doncaster’s cartoonish pop-punk upstart Dominic Harrison, AKA Yungblud, suggests a moody makeover. Firstly, it’s self-titled – artist shorthand for the “real me” – while the cover art swaps 2020 chart-topper Weird!’s kooky cosplay for a simple image showing a crestfallen Yungblud. Thankfully, it’s all a pose, with the oversized, Billy Idol-esque opener The Funeral featuring slurred lines such as: “I’ve got a fucked up soul and an STD.”That single careens into Tissues, built around a sample of the Cure’s Close to Me for extra goth points, with its skyscraping, lovelorn chorus an album highlight. Breezy, big-chorused guitar pop suits Harrison’s elastic vocals, even when his lyrics let him down, as on the 1975-aping, toxic masculinity diatribe I Cry 2 (“It’s alright mate, I cry too”). Sweet Heroine lazily links love with addiction, while the 90-second Die for a Night aims for metaphysical poetry but ends in a shrug of “I don’t know what I’m talking about”. Continue reading...",

The photographer Stephen Shames and his co-author Ericka Huggins, the party’s longest-serving female member, look backStephen Shames had just turned 20 when he visited the headquarters of the Black Panther party in Oakland, California, and showed some of his recent photographs to Bobby Seale, co-founder and main spokesman for the organisation. Though Shames was still finding his way as a photographer, Seale liked what he saw and decided to use some of the pictures in the Black Panther newspaper. So it was that a young white guy from Cambridge, Massachusetts became the official chronicler of the Black Panthers from 1967 to 1973, documenting their community programmes, protests, rallies, arrests and funerals at close hand.“The Panthers were never a black nationalist organisation,” says Shames, now 74. “They formed alliances with many black writers and activists and their whole legal team was white. They were not out to get white people, as the American government insisted. They were a revolutionary organisation who worked with anybody they felt was sincerely trying to change the system to benefit poor people and create a more just society.”Party member Earlene Coleman prepares food bags as part of the Panther Free Food Program, March 1972.

His art is generally described as a form of geometric abstraction, but the description seems entirely inadequate. His paintings are slow, meticulous, exquisitely conceived in their balance of shapes and colours against the rectangle of each canvas, but they all carry a depth of memory and emotion, and often a quizzical humour that turns them into something closer to stories.Born in Liège in 1938, Wuidar worked for many years as a professor of drawing before he allowed himself to paint full-time from the age of 60. His earliest works seem to carry childhood recollections of the second world war. Continue reading...",

        "description": "On Aug. 8, 2022, FBI agents searched several areas in Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. They removed 15 boxes, 14 of which contained U.S. government documents marked classified, secret, or top secret.\n\n\n\nTo protect national security, an ongoing criminal investigation, and the individuals involved in it, FBI and Department of Justice officials have a duty, at least for now, not to divulge the contents of the documents, and what prompted them to request a search warrant. Former President Trump has an obligation to explain what he did and why he did it.\n\n\n\nTo date, Trump’s public statements have been limited to attacks on the FBI, DOJ, and Biden administration, many of which are unsubstantiated or demonstrably false.\n\n\n\nAlthough the search warrant was approved by a judge magistrate, Trump maintained that his home was “under siege” and “occupied” by FBI agents, in a manner akin to the corrupt practices “in broken Third World countries.” He said the “raid” was one episode in&nbsp;a “witch hunt” designed by “Radical Left Democrats” and implemented by Justice Department officials, who are colluding, he said, with President Biden to prevent Trump from running for president in 2024.\n\n\n\nTrump asserted that he had issued a “standing order” while he was president that documents moved from the Oval Office to his residence were to be immediately and automatically deemed to be declassified. The alleged mandate did not include consultation with or even notification of relevant agencies; 18 top officials of the Trump administration have characterized the claim that he issued this standing order as “ludicrous,” “a complete fiction,” and “bulls—t.” One of them, former White House Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly, said he could not “imagine that anyone who worked in the White House would have allowed that order to go forward without dying in the ditch to stop it.”\n\n\n\nTrump suggested — without evidence — that Biden knew in advance about and approved the Mar-a-Lago search warrant. He also insinuated that FBI agents&nbsp;— “This, after all, was the FBI” — had planted the documents they said they found on the premises.\n\n\n\nThe former president has insisted that his attorneys and representatives “were cooperating fully” and that “the government could have had whatever they wanted, if we had it.” We now know that his representatives slow-walked the National Archives for over a year, that a grand jury issued a subpoena and DOJ officials visited Mar-a-Lago seeking compliance with it — and still all the documents were not handed over.&nbsp;Although a Trump lawyer certified that all material marked classified had been returned, the search on Aug. 8 yielded twice as many classified documents as had been returned by Trump’s lawyers when they swore there were no more.\n\n\n\nIf Trump still believes that anyone who is “extremely careless in the handling of very sensitive, highly classified information” is “not fit” to serve in a position of authority in the U.S. government, then he must publicly address the questions that arise from his apparent decision to retain such information in an unsecured location in his home.\n\n\n\nTrump should explain why he, unlike his predecessors, should own government documents generated during his tenure in office, and why he chose to transfer specific documents to Mar-a-Lago. Many Americans may sympathize with his desire to keep the meteorological map of Hurricane Dorian he marked up with a black Sharpie or “love letters” from Kim Jong-Un, the Supreme Leader of North Korea. But possession of top secret documents about human and technological sources and methods has already prompted speculation that he wants to prevent the National Archives from acquiring material that could damage his reputation; have close-at-hand communications that he could use to embarrass, intimidate, or injure someone he believes slighted or poses a threat to him; or, among Trump’s conspiracy-driven critics, to accumulate information he can sell.\n\n\n\nTrump should also provide a detailed account of who had access to the material stored at Mar-a-Lago, which is a private club visited by many people, who, of course, do not have security clearances. He must indicate as well whether any documents were altered, moved to another location, or destroyed.\n\n\n\nThe stakes are very high for Trump — and the nation.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice is investigating potential crimes, including mishandling of government records, violations of the Espionage Act (i.e., retention or mishandling of documents containing information that could harm national security or help foreign adversaries), and obstruction of justice.\n\n\n\nAs U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) declared in 2016, there are many people on the political right “who are going to have to explain and justify how they fell into this trap of supporting Donald Trump, because this is not going to end well, one way or the other.”\n\n\n\nIf the former president, whose Teflon coating may be wearing thin, wants to dispel perceptions that he is hiding something, and prove Rubio wrong, he has his work cut out for him — especially if, as with the 2020 presidential election and the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, he cannot rely on the truth to do it.\n\n\n\nGlenn C. Altschuler is the Thomas and Dorothy Litwin Professor of American Studies at Cornell University. He is the co-author (with Stuart Blumin) of “Rude Republic: Americans and Their Politics in the Nineteenth Century.”",

        "description": "I’m going to be taking a little time away from watching the Premier League, because VAR is simply ruining the experience for me. Even if it were well-implemented, VAR would be a mistake because it interferes so badly with the flow of the game and the game’s emotions — no one can celebrate anything any more without waiting to see if VAR flips the script. But it is not well-implemented. Especially in the Premier League it is more likely to result in a wrong decision than a correct one. \nOf course, this is simply one element of the shockingly low level of officiating quality in the Premier League, but it greatly magnifies incompetence. I would rather live with ordinary human error than have to deal with technologically-enhanced human error. When people are already bad at their job, it’s unwise to give them even more opportunities to be bad. \nI only watch footy because it’s fun, and VAR — plus other elements in the catastrophic mismanagement of English football in general and the Premier League in particular — takes away a lot of that fun. So why should I keep watching? ",

        "description": "12:34PM: Price has been officially placed on the 15-day IL and Pepiot was officially recalled.\n7:51AM: The Dodgers will place left-hander David Price on the 15-day injured list today, manager Dave Roberts told reporters (including Jack Harris of the Los Angeles Times) following last night&#8217;s game.  Right-hander Ryan Pepiot will be called up from Triple-A to take Price&#8217;s spot on the active roster, and Pepiot is scheduled to work as the bulk pitcher today behind opener Caleb Ferguson.\nPrice is dealing with inflammation in his left wrist, and received an MRI to fully explore an injury that Roberts said has been nagging Price for the entire season.  The injury isn&#8217;t considered overly serious, and Price is expected back before the regular season is over.  Since Price hasn&#8217;t pitched since August 29, his IL placement will be backdated a few days and he could be back by mid-September if he is able to return from the IL when first eligible.\nPrice has hinted that this could be his final season, and while the lefty is no longer an ace or even a starting pitcher, Price is still effective at age 37.  Over 38 1/3 innings out of the Los Angeles bullpen, Price has a 2.58 ERA, 23.3% strikeout rate, and 5.0% walk rate.  He has been particularly effective in the second half of the season, with a 1.13 ERA over 16 frames since the All-Star break.\nWhile Price doesn&#8217;t usually pitch in high-leverage situations, ending his career as a relief pitcher would provide a nice bookend to his first MLB season, when the Rays used Price as a key late-game weapon in 2008 and Price helped Tampa Bay reach the World Series.  The Dodgers are deep in pitching options, but presumably Price (if healthy) has done enough to merit inclusion on the team&#8217;s postseason roster, and to potentially cap off his career with another championship.\nOnce the Price move is official, the Dodgers will have 10 pitchers on the injured list, with some already known to be out for the season and others battling more minor injuries.  Since L.A. enjoys an 18-game lead in the NL West, the team has some flexibility in giving players time off to address nagging injuries and get fully healed for the postseason.\nIn other Dodgers injury news, Brusdar Graterol is hoping to play catch today or tomorrow as he recovers from right elbow inflammation.  Graterol told Bill Plunkett of the Southern California News Group and other reporters that his injury is indeed just inflammation, as revealed by a recent MRI.  Graterol was retroactively placed on the 15-day injured list on August 31, just over a week after he returned from missing nearly six weeks on another IL stint due to shoulder inflammation.\nPlunkett also reported that Tony Gonsolin was doing some throwing in the outfield yesterday, which is a good sign given the concerning nature of the forearm strain that sent Gonsolin to the 15-day IL earlier this week.  The Dodgers were hopeful at the time that Gonsolin&#8217;s strain was relatively minor, and that his IL trip was mostly preventative.  Roberts said a few days ago that Gonsolin received good results on an MRI, and Gonsolin already throwing is a step towards the All-Star right-hander possibly being able to return in relatively short order.\nMoving onto position players, Roberts told Plunkett and company that Gavin Lux will miss a few games after receiving a cortisone shot.  Lux has missed time over the last two weeks dealing with neck and upper-back soreness, and the hope is that the cortisone shot will help enough that Lux can avoid the injured list.\nLux has been the Dodgers&#8217; primary second baseman this season, also getting a good chunk of time in left field and some fill-in work at shortstop.  The former top prospect has somewhat quietly had a breakout at the plate, hitting .293/.368/.428 with six homers and a league-best seven triples over 418 plate appearances, translating to a 127 wRC+ that is well above the league average.  Max Muncy&#8217;s resurgence over the last few weeks gives the Dodgers some cover at second base with Lux at less than 100 percent, but Los Angeles could definitely use Lux healthy for the postseason.",

If the Foo Fighters were playing a festival, he said, he made a point of touring the other artists’ dressing rooms, bottle of whisky in hand. “I don’t give a shit,” he said, “you could be Demi Lovato or the fucking drummer from Pantera, I don’t care – let’s have a drink.”Clearly, this is an attitude that Grohl shared with the Foo Fighters’ late drummer, Taylor Hawkins. How else to explain the bill at the first of two tribute concerts organised in the wake of his death in March? It swerves wildly, serving up mainstream pop next to tricky prog rock, metal beside Britpop. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photo by Scott Kane/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Sigh. Another day, another loss to the Cubs’ biggest rival. It wears on you, day after day writing recaps of losses to the Cardinals.\nHey, here’s a dumb dad joke: Since the Cubs lost 8-0 on Friday and 8-4 on Saturday, does that mean they will at least be good enough to force an 8-8 tie sometime during Sunday’s game?\nTold you it was dumb.\nAnyway, you came here for a recap and by gum, you will get one.\nThe Cubs actually took an early multiple-run lead in this game. Blink and you probably missed it, but here’s how they did that against Adam Wainwright.\nSeiya Suzuki and Ian Happ singled with one out in the first inning, and then this single by Franmil Reyes made it 1-0 [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Nico Hoerner hit into a force play, advancing Happ to third, Nico stole second.\nThat put two runners in scoring position and Rafael Ortega brought them both home [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\n3-0! First inning! What could possibly...\nWell, you know the answer to that. A walk and a home run by Paul Goldschmidt off Drew Smyly in the bottom of the first brought St. Louis back to within 3-2, and then Smyly, who had a fantastic August, completely fell apart in his first September start in the third inning.\nA pair of solo homers, by Tommy Edman and Tyler O’Neill, gave St. Louis a 4-3 lead. A single and a couple of walks loaded the bases, and Jeremiah Estrada replaced Smyly. Yadier Molina smacked a double to center that cleared the bases and made it 7-3, and then Molina added insult to injury by stealing third base, where he scored on a sacrifice fly.\nThat was it for Cardinals scoring, so I guess I can give a few props to Mark Leiter Jr., Rowan Wick, Erich Uelmen and Luke Farrell, who threw five scoreless innings. So, yay? Only two of those four pitches are likely to be members of the 2023 Cubs, so... draw your own conclusions.\nIn the fifth, the Cubs made it 8-4. Ian Happ doubled, his 36th of the season. Reyes drove him in with this single [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\n8-4 in the fifth... maybe? Nah. The Cubs had just three more baserunners the rest of the game, on a double by Yan Gomes in the sixth, Happ being hit by a pitch in the seventh and a walk drawn by Nelson Velázquez in the eighth. The latter two runners were erased on double plays. The Cardinals turned four of those in this game.\nHere, have one more Cubs highlight, a nice diving catch by Happ in the eighth [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s all I’ve got for this one, and I realize this recap is pretty short, but you really don’t want more on this game, do you? Here, one last not-so-fun fact: The Cubs won four of the first six games they played against the Cardinals this year. Since then they are 2-10 against them.\nThe final Cubs/Cardinals game of 2022 will take place Sunday afternoon, weather permitting. Marcus Stroman will start for the Cubs and Miles Mikolas will go for St. Louis. Game time is 1:15 p.m. CT and TV coverage will be via Marquee Sports Network. The game preview here will post at 11:30 a.m. CT.",

        "description": "Some six months since the start of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the emergence of three realities in the war is forcing Washington to wrestle with some hard choices.\n\n\n\nThe first is that the combination of Ukrainian courage and U.S. technology has proved quite potent in blocking Russia’s attempt to conquer the bulk of Ukraine. American air defense support has denied Russia the air superiority essential to the rapid advance of its ground forces. American anti-tank weapons and targeting intelligence have prevented Russia’s armor from sweeping into Kyiv, and Russia has suffered significant personnel losses, particularly in its officer corps. Putin has been forced to downsize his battlefield ambitions and rely on a barrage of stand-off artillery and rocket strikes to slowly grind down Ukraine’s defenses in its Donbas region.\n\n\n\nThe second is that despite this defensive success, Ukraine has been unable to build offensive momentum and force the Russian military to withdraw. The delivery of advanced American artillery, rocket and missile systems has certainly helped Ukraine to strike Russian supply lines and weapons platforms, but its infantry has not been able to muster the numbers required to seize ground defended by Russian forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky insists that his long-promised offensive against Russian forces near Kherson will change this picture. But a near-term Ukrainian victory in the war is difficult to imagine.\n\n\n\nThe third is that American efforts to strong-arm Putin into retreat by crippling the Russian economy and isolating him on the world stage have sputtered. Western sanctions are no doubt hurting Russia; the International Monetary Fund forecasts a 6 percent decline in Russia’s GDP this year, and its technology sector faces a grim future. But this compares to a greater than 40 percent economic plunge in Ukraine. Russia’s currency is stronger today than it was before the war, despite President Biden’s vow to “turn the ruble into rubble.” Russian earnings from energy exports have actually grown thanks to higher oil prices and reluctance outside the West to join sanctions. Putin is persona non grata in the West, but he is hardly a pariah in the rest of the world, as his scheduled attendance at the G-20 summit meeting in Indonesia in November will attest.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the economic fallout from the war is landing on the West as well as on Russia. Americans are grappling with higher gasoline and food prices. Europe is facing not only the prospect of a cold winter, but also significant disruptions in key industries, as sanctions-related shortages of natural gas and other Russian commodities take their toll on the construction, metals, and automotive sectors. Germany, highly dependent on Russian energy supplies, is headed toward significant economic turbulence in the coming months if current trends continue.\n\n\n\nThese realities have reshaped Putin’s strategy. Recognizing America’s advantages in battlefield technology, Putin has turned the conflict into an endurance contest that plays to Russian strengths. He is relying increasingly on China and the Global South to outflank Western sanctions, while counting on the vaunted pain tolerance of the Russian people to outlast Western political resolve. And he is apparently calculating that, even with sustained Western support, Ukraine cannot match Russia’s reserves of manpower, munitions and economic resilience in a war of attrition. Putin may be unable to conquer Ukraine altogether, but he can turn it into a bleeding wound for years to come, unable to mend itself and in no condition to join NATO.\n\n\n\nUnless we change the terms of engagement, time may well be Putin’s ally in Ukraine. What choices do we have to counter his moves?\n\n\n\nTightening the economic noose around Russia will be ineffective. Any faint hopes we may once have entertained for winning China’s support against Russia were destroyed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) recent visit to Taiwan. Western sanctions on Russia have proved to be an economic bonanza for India, which is eagerly purchasing Russian oil at discount prices and reselling it in Europe. On balance, the Global South is far more alarmed by perceived American economic and cultural imperialism than by Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nMilitary escalation in pursuit of a Ukrainian victory would be an enormous gamble. Washington’s large cadre of hawks insists that we should “pull out all the stops by providing Ukraine the means it needs to prevail.” But this almost certainly would require much more than simply sending longer-range artillery and rocket systems. Ukraine needs massive help operating and maintaining these systems, equipping and manning its air force, and training and expanding its ground forces — all time-intensive tasks that could drag the United States more deeply into the fighting. Those advocating all-out military support for Ukraine presuppose that Putin would accept defeat rather than risk a direct — and possibly nuclear — clash with NATO. If that assumption were proved wrong, the consequences could be catastrophic.\n\n\n\nFostering political change inside Russia is at best a long-term endeavor. But if Washington means to encourage opposition to Putin, its current approach is backfiring. Even Russians who have no love for Putin and lament the rupture in relations with the West have been shocked by the degree of Western animus toward the Russian people and culture in recent years. The United States is doing little to appeal to Russia’s citizenry or to show that we are open to improved relations in return for improved Russian behavior. Washington’s recent announcement that it is establishing a separate military command to oversee the aid mission in Ukraine appears to bear out Putin’s messaging to Russians that their fight is with the United States, which is intent on Russia’s demise.\n\n\n\nAs long as we are unwilling to steer toward a compromise settlement — which, as Kyiv itself proposed early in the war, would have to involve some form of armed neutrality for Ukraine — we face a choice between escalating our involvement and engaging in an endurance contest in which Putin likes his chances. Neither approach is likely to end well for Ukraine or for the United States.\n\n\n\nGeorge Beebe is director of grand strategy at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.

She was last seen jogging around the University of Memphis campus during the early morning hours. \n\n\n\nIn a video statement, Fletcher's family urged local residents to do anything they can to assist with authorities’ investigation of the local kindergarten teacher and mother of two's disappearance, according to the Commercial Appeal in Memphis. \n\n\n\nA $50,000 reward is being offered in the case as well. \n\n\n\n\"The family has met with police, and we have shared with them all the information we know. More than anything, we want to see Liza returned home safely,\" Fletcher’s uncle, Mike Keeney, said in a statement.\n\n\n\nAuthorities also said a second individual was arrested during the investigation, but is not believed to be connected to Fletcher's abduction.",

        "description": "Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Your Sunday morning dose of New York Mets and MLB news, notes, and links. Meet the Mets\n\nThe Mets lost a clunker to the Nationals 7-1. Max Scherzer was good for five innings, but left the game early due to “feeling fatigued on his left side.” Eduardo Escobar homered to even the game at one run apiece, where it remained until the eighth inning when Lane Thomas hit a home run off Adam Ottavino. The Nationals then piled on against Adonis Medina in the ninth, sealing the fate of this ugly contest.\nChoose your recap: Amazin’ Avenue, NY Post, Daily News, Newsday, MLB.com, North Jersey, ESPN\nObviously the big story from yesterday’s game is that Max Scherzer left the game after just 67 pitches due to “feeling fatigued on his left side.” Scherzer said he could have pushed through it, but didn’t feel it was a good idea. The Mets are optimistic that he will make his next start.\nTrevor May went on the injured list yesterday without an injury designation, which likely means that it is COVID-related.\nJoey Lucchesi pitched two innings in his fourth rehab appearance for Single-A St. Lucie.\nMark Canha and other Mets foodies spoke to the New York Post about their favorite NYC restaurants.\nAround the National League East\nJake Odorizzi was scratched from yesterday’s game due to arm fatigue. Bryce Elder started the game for the Braves instead and they beat the Marlins 2-1.\nThe Phillies lost to the Giants 5-4 in a game in which San Francisco used 23 different players and in which defensive miscues sunk the Phillies again.\nNick Castellanos is getting an MRI after feeling discomfort in his right side after a swing on Friday night.\nAround Major League Baseball\nYesterday Dylan Cease lost a no-hit bid on the final out. MLB.com looks back at other pitchers who didn’t give up a hit until the final out of the game.\nZach Plesac is sidelined after breaking his finger punching the mound.\nAaron Judge and Jacob deGrom will be the two free agents at the center of the story of this upcoming offseason, writes Jon Heyman of the New York Post.\nThomas Harrigan of MLB.com reviews a list of free agents for whom this stretch run could be very influential in determining the nature of their paydays.\nYesterday at Amazin’ Avenue\nChris McShane covered the Trevor May injured list update.\nThis Date in Mets History\nHappy Birthday, Mike Piazza!",

        "description": "Photo by Julio Aguilar/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Because if I don’t start laughing about it, I’m going to get mad.  Somewhat late in Duck Soup, the Marx Brothers’ classic takedown of war, the tragically dimwitted Chicolini finds himself on trial for the attempted burglary of Freedonia’s war plans. After a series of increasingly outrageous miscommunications on the stand, Groucho’s Rufus T. Firefly begins his suggestion for sentencing by delivering this classic insult: \n“Gentlemen, Chicolini here may talk like an idiot and look like an idiot, but don’t let that fool you: He really is an idiot.”\nAs I wasted my Friday night watching the Yankees get blown out by the Tampa Bay Rays in a maybe-not-quite-must-win-but-still-very-important game—a game, mind you, that felt extremely winnable for about three quarters of the evening—I couldn't help but laugh. I probably should’ve been frustrated, but I honestly couldn’t let myself get to that point because this collapse has been so deeply funny that it’s turned itself into a farce. \nDon’t get what I mean? To start, we have to go back a few games to the series in Oakland. \nAugust 25-28: Oakland Coliseum \nAfter jumping out to a quick 2-0 series lead, the Yankees looked to claim a series victory against Adam Oller, one of the worst starting pitchers in baseball this season. Instead, they managed just one hit and one walk in eight innings against him. Okay, that’s fine. Sometimes even bad pitchers have good nights, and thankfully Domingo Germán threw up a bunch of zeroes too. Fine. \nBut then the funniest thing happened. \nIn the 10th inning, the 2021 MVP made a surprise appearance, as both Andrew Benintendi and Josh Donaldson came around to score on one A.J. Puk wild pitch. The game was well in-hand, folks. Surely this would be a sixth-straight Yankees victory. \n\n\nOne wild pitch leads to a pair of Yankees run and breaks a scoreless tie in the 10th! Andrew Benintendi and Josh Donaldson both touch home!#YANKSonYES pic.twitter.com/0p1eH2n2WA— YES Network (@YESNetwork) August 28, 2022\n\n\n\nOh, no, dear reader. Remember, we’re living in a farce here, and that’s just not how things work in this type of world. \nIn the bottom of the 10th, Stephen Vogt, who I genuinely did not realize was still in the league, hit a two run shot off of the formerly infallible Ron Marinaccio and we were all square once again. After the bottom of the order went quietly in the top of the 11th, the Athletics walked the Yankees off in the bottom half of the frame when Anthony Rizzo was unable to corral an errant throw from DJ LeMahieu, who committed his first throwing error from second base in over two years. \n\n\nDJ LeMahieu makes a bad throw on a would be double play. The Yankees challenged for possible interference but the slide was clean. Yankees lose pic.twitter.com/A7cgfcXHHr— Talkin' Yanks (@TalkinYanks) August 28, 2022\n\n\n\nBallgame over. \nAs if that wasn't bad enough, the Yankees would end the most winnable four-game set of the season with an equally embarrassing 4-1 loss, where they managed just four hits against someone named Adrian Martinez and split the series against the second-worst team in baseball. \nAugust 29-31: Angel Stadium\nSurely that was just a fluke, right? Surely the Yankees would be able to get back on track against the lowly Angels, right? Well...\nAfter splitting the first two games of the series, Gerrit Cole was on the bump in game three for a team desperately searching for a series victory. Instead, he got a sixth inning that saw Josh Donaldson make an excellent play but throw the ball away and Isiah Kiner-Falefa boot a routine grounder that was quite literally right at him on back-to-back plays. Up stepped Shohei Ohtani for an at-bat that never should’ve happened, and, well, we all knew where this one was going...\n\n\nOhtani takes Cole deep and propels the Halos into the lead  #GoHalos | @Angels pic.twitter.com/E6o9k6B6fF— Bally Sports West (@BallySportWest) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Yankees offense would do absolutely nothing for the rest of the game and wound up dropping both the game and the series. \nSeptember 2-4: Tropicana Field\nAnd that brings us to the series against the Rays, who suddenly entered this matchup just six games behind the Yankees.*\nAuthor’s note: I’m writing this after game one of the series because I’m in desperate need of something to distract me from that performance and I don’t think I can stomach watching tomorrow’s game.\nAfter popping up to short to open the fourth inning, cameras caught Donaldson mouthing off to Rays’ starter Jeffrey Springs, apparently asking him to throw a fastball or something I guess. The bringer of unwanted attention promptly responded by committing back-to-back errors—one fielding and one throwing, for good measure—with one out in the bottom of the fourth. After being saved by an Oswaldo Cabrera assist on the latter error, the Rays took the lead on a David Peralta RBI single. \nAnd then the bottom of the eighth happened. \nDown 3-0, Greg Weissert gave up a single to start the inning, induced a pop up, gave up a double, and then got a strike out. Then, with two outs, runners on second and third, and a batter whose sporting a cool 61 wRC+ on the year at the plate, whatever the hell this is happened:\n\n\nThings just keep gettin worse pic.twitter.com/9IOHqfNfAj— Talkin' Yanks (@TalkinYanks) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nI’m willing to concede that this was a tough play for Weissert to make, but if that isn’t physical comedy at its finest, I’m not sure what is. Anthony Banda came in to relieve Weissert of his duties and let another three runs score on the back of two hits and three walks before Marwin González came in to put us all out of our misery. \nEntering a very important game, the Yankees limped to a 9-0 loss. The offense managed just five hits, while Weissert and Banda teamed up for an improbable six hits, three walks, and six runs in a combined one inning of work. \nA farce in motion\nOne of the key elements of the farce is a character who does not belong in the wildly exaggerated, absurd environment they find themselves in; a character so lost at sea that every single one of their movements through space is hilarious simply because they’re incapable of making sense of their surroundings. \nIn this case, that’s us. We’re lost, and the joke’s on us for watching these games and expecting anything more than slapstick comedy. Rather than being frustrated, I find myself laughing as I see balls skip past the first baseman’s glove or bats harmlessly wave through the night sky, because of course that’s going to happen here, night-in and night-out. Why wouldn’t it? We need to embrace the absurdity of this collapse, because not doing so would make us look a whole lot like poor Chicolini. \nTo paraphrase Rufus T. Firefly, this team may field like a farce and hit like a farce, but don’t let that fool you: They really are a farce.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/diamondbacks-to-promote-ryne-nelson-on-monday.html",
        "description": "Diamondbacks pitching prospect Ryne Nelson will make his MLB debut on Monday, manager Torey Lovullo told The Arizona Republic&#8217;s Nick Piecoro and other reporters.  Nelson isn&#8217;t on the team&#8217;s 40-man roster, so at least one corresponding move will need to be made to create space for the 24-year-old right-hander.\nA second-round selection in the 2019 draft, Nelson received some top-100 attention prior to the season, with The Athletic&#8217;s Keith Law rating him 74th on his list of baseball&#8217;s best prospects and Baseball America rating Nelson 96th.  Law felt that Nelson was &#8220;the safe bet who offers the strongest combination of current stuff and command&#8221; among Arizona&#8217;s top pitching prospects, which was enough for Law to rate Nelson slightly ahead of other notable D&#8217;Back hurlers Drey Jameson and Brandon Pfaadt.\nNelson will be the first of that pitching trio to make the majors, though Nelson has had a rocky time in his first exposure to Triple-A baseball.  Nelson has a 5.43 ERA over 136 Triple-A innings this season, with a 21.6% strikeout rate and 7.6% walk rate.  That walk rate is Nelson&#8217;s best over his three pro seasons while his strikeout rate is by far his lowest, and Nelson has also allowed 25 homers.  However, as Piecoro notes, these results are certainly influenced by the hitter-friendly conditions of Triple-A Reno and in the Pacific Coast League in general.\nNelson&#8217;s fastball is his signature pitch, averaging only around 93-94mph but with a lot of spin.  BA gives Nelson&#8217;s fastball an impressive 70 grade on the 20-80 scale, while Pipeline is a little less bullish with a 60 grade.  Pipeline&#8217;s scouting report also gives plus grades to Nelson&#8217;s curve and slider, and according to some D&#8217;Backs personnel, the slider could eventually become the right-hander&#8217;s best pitch.\nIt is worth noting that Nelson is still something of a work in progress as a pitcher, as he was a two-way player at Oregon and didn&#8217;t turn solely to pitching until 2019.  Between that relatively late start and the canceled 2020 minor league season, BA&#8217;s scouting report feels Nelson &#8220;could still have significant growth ahead of him.&#8221;  For example, he has made enough improvement with his control that he now looks like a viable starting candidate, whereas there was some feeling that Nelson would ultimately end up as a reliever.\nThe Diamondbacks see what Nelson can do in Monday&#8217;s start against the Padres, and possibly for the rest of September.  Lovullo said the club is moving to a six-man rotation in order to rest some arms and keep everyone fresh in the final month of play, with an eye towards juggling the rotation in advance of a September 20 doubleheader against the Dodgers.  After an day off on September 8, the D&#8217;Backs play 18 games in a 17-day span before their next off-day.",

        "description": "Photo by Brett Davis/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Braves will try to win their fifth game in a row by sweeping the Marlins as they send Max Fried to the mound to oppose Pablo Lopez. After picking up a game in the standings with a walkoff win on Saturday night, the Atlanta Braves will try to sweep away the Miami Marlins as they send Max Fried to the hill to square off against Pablo Lopez.\nAlthough Fried has been one of the game’s pitchers through the first five months of the 2022 season (ranking fifth in fWAR currently), he had an off night in his last outing. Against the Rockies on August 30, Fried lasted just five frames with a 3/1 K/BB ratio. It was his lowest strikeout total since April 21, 2021, against the Marlins, and only the second time this season he failed to record a 16th out. Still, even with a host of command issues, Fried gave the Braves a chance to win, though they ended up dropping a 3-2 decision anyway.\nOne bit of intrigue for this game is the opportunity it affords Fried to move into the fWAR lead, and therefore presumably the Cy Young Award lead for the NL. Fried currently trails Carlos Rodon and Aaron Nola by 0.3 fWAR (4.6 versus 4.9), but has one fewer start. A great outing can push him ahead of both, and the ineffectual Miami attack seems like a good candidate against which to rack up value, provided his command issues were just a temporary blip and not something that will linger into this outing. His only prior outing against Miami this year, where he had a 5/3 K/BB ratio and allowed a homer in six innings in a 6-3 May win, won’t do it — but something with a 2.5/1 K/BB ratio across seven innings with zero homers allowed just might push him into the fWAR lead.\nThe Braves’ bats have exhibited a bit of whiplash lately. After scoring 25 combined runs across two games last week, they scored three or fewer while splitting the next four games, but then clobbered Sandy Alcantara before eking out a 2-1 win last night. Miami’s starter for today, Pablo Lopez, doesn’t really suggest anything in this regard. On the season, Lopez has a 92/96/90 line. He’s been somewhat worse lately as he was much more effective in April and May, but isn’t a pushover by any stretch. A few weeks ago, Lopez went 5 2⁄3 against Atlanta with a 4/0 K/BB ratio and a homer allowed as the Braves edged Miami by a 4-3 score.\n\nGame Info\nMiami Marlins @ Atlanta Braves\nSunday, September 4, 2022\n1:35 pm EDT\nTruist Park, Atlanta, GA\nTV: Bally Sports Southeast\nRadio: 680 AM/93.7 FM The Fan\nXM Radio: Ch. 176",

        "description": "Jordan Westburg continues to rake at triple-A  | USA TODAY NETWORK\n    \n\n  It was a big day for first homers with Joey Ortiz, Ramon Rodriguez, and Darell Hernaiz all going deep for the first time with their teams Triple-A: Norfolk Tides 7, Lehigh Valley IronPigs (Phillies) 2\nThis was a close game until the eighth inning when the Tides put up four runs to cushion the score. That inning featured a bases-loaded, three-run double from #6-T prospect Jordan Westburg, his only hit of the game to go along with two walks. \nThe Tides also scored runs on the first triple-A homers for both Joey Ortiz (#24-T) and Ramon Rodriguez. It was Rodriguez’s first game at this level and he made the most of it by going 3-for-4 and picking a runner off of first. \nNumber 5 prospect, Colton Cowser, had a single and a walk from the top of the lineup. Cowser has gotten off to a bit of a slow start in his first five games at this level, getting just three hits in his first five games. \nDrew Rom (#15) made the start for the Tides and allowed two runs in five innings. He struck out seven with no walks. \n\n\nTides break open the game with @jordan_cw21 knocking a three-run double!E8 | Norfolk 7, Lehigh Valley 2#RisingTide pic.twitter.com/t2ZHYjJU7d— Norfolk Tides (@NorfolkTides) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nBox Score\nDouble-A: Bowie Baysox 7, Erie SeaWolves (Tigers) 2\nDown 1-0 going into the sixth inning, the Baysox scored seven runs over the final four innings to beat the SeaWolves. Four of those runs were knocked in by Darell Hernaiz (#24-T), who hit his first double-A home run as part of a two-hit day. \nCoby Mayo (#6-T) had the only other two-hit game for the Baysox, while Hudson Haskin (#22) picked up two RBI with a 1-for-4 game. \nConnor Norby (#12) came out of the game after his third plate appearance. He was hit by a pitch and took his base, but did not go back out to the field for the bottom of the inning. Fingers crossed it’s nothing serious. \nChayce McDermott (#19) got the start and pitched five solid innings with just one run allowed on three hits and two walks. That run scored on a solo homer. \nBox Score\nHigh-A: Hickory Crawdads (Rangers) 4, Aberdeen IronBirds 1\nAfter retiring the first six batters he faced, IronBirds’ starter Houston Roth lost it in the third, giving up three runs on three singles and two walks. He followed that with a scoreless fourth to finish his day but the damage was done as the Crawdads cruised to victory. \nThe lone IronBirds run scored in the eighth inning when Billy Cook singled, stole second, and came in to score on a Donta’ Williams single. \nHeston Kjerstad (#9) went 1-for-4 with a double. \nBox Score\nLow-A: Fredericksburg Nationals 5, Delmarva Shorebirds 2\nNoelberth Romero came to the plate twice with the opportunity for the Shorebirds to score runs, and he was sort of successful both times. In the second inning, Douglas Hodo was hit by a pitch and then stole second, giving Romero the chance for an RBI. He took it with a single. \nIn the fourth, Reed Trimble (#28-T) and Silas Ardoin hit back-to-back singles to put runners on first and third with no outs. In that instance Romero hit into a double play. The run scored but the brewing rally was squashed. \nTop 10 prospects Jackson Holliday (#3) and Dylan Beavers (#10) both went 1-for-4 with Holliday also picking up a walk. \nStarting pitcher Conor Grady gave up three runs in five innings, which isn’t great. But he did strike out six. \nBox Score\nSunday’s Scheduled Games\n\nNorfolk vs Lehigh Valley, 4:05. SP: Chris Vallimont\nBowie @ Erie, 1:35. SP: TBD\nAberdeen vs Hickory, 2:05. SP: Daniel Lloyd\nDelmarva @ Fredericksburg, 1:35. SP: TBD",

This is a moment to throw old political assumptions out the window and to consider that Democrats could buck historic trends this cycle…”\n\n\n\n“With over two months until Election Day, uncertainty abounds. Election prognostication relies heavily on past precedent. Yet there is no precedent for an election centered around the removal of a constitutional right affirmed a half-century before. Every poll we consume over the closing weeks of this election will rely on a likely voter model for which we have no benchmark.”",

        "description": "With just eight weeks until the midterm elections, things are starting to look up for Democrats.\n\n\n\nThey now lead the generic vote after trailing Republicans for months: nearly one-half (47 percent) of registered voters say they would vote for a Democrat, compared to 44 percent for a Republican, per recent Wall Street Journal&nbsp;polling.\n\n\n\nFurther, gas prices are on the decline, President Biden’s signature spending bill passed, and voters in Kansas — a state Trump won by&nbsp;15 percent&nbsp;in 2020 — resoundingly&nbsp;rejected&nbsp;a Republican-led abortion ban, indicating that protecting abortion rights could be a motivating issue for voters in November.\n\n\n\nDemocrats are also outperforming expectations in special elections across the country. This week, Democrat Mary Peltola&nbsp;defeated&nbsp;Sarah Palin for Alaska’s vacant House seat, and last week,&nbsp;Democrat Pat Ryan&nbsp;won&nbsp;an upset victory over Republican Marc Molinaro in New York’s 19th Congressional District.\n\n\n\nWhile these are encouraging developments for Democrats, it would be a mistake to say that the party is not still electorally vulnerable.&nbsp;Inflation&nbsp;continues to destroy Americans’ purchasing power,&nbsp;gas prices&nbsp;— while they have steadily decreased — remain high,&nbsp;gun violence&nbsp;is terrorizing cities and Southern states continue to experience huge surges in&nbsp;illegal immigration.\n\n\n\nUltimately, in order for Democrats’ momentum to continue through November, the party needs to adopt a third-way agenda — and specifically, demonstrate their ability to practice fiscal prudence and lead on both crime and immigration reform, while also continuing to advocate for abortion rights and gun safety.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPracticing fiscal prudence is a key component of a new Democratic approach. Rising prices and the high cost of living are weighing on American families, and Democrats can’t afford to be dragged further to the left on economic policy. The party needs to communicate about how they will lower costs, secure America’s energy independence and avoid tax increases that strangle American businesses and families.\n\n\n\nFurther, as crime rates surge across the country —&nbsp;with nearly 9-in-10 (89 percent) of Americans saying crime is a “very” or “somewhat” important issue to them, per Economist/YouGov&nbsp;polling&nbsp;—&nbsp;Democrats should pledge ahead of the midterms to pursue a grand bargain with Republicans on criminal justice legislation in the new Congress.\n\n\n\nThis deal would involve funding and strengthening local law enforcement, while also making the criminal justice system fairer for Black Americans, who are disproportionately victims of police misconduct and are mistreated under the current system.\n\n\n\nBeyond the necessity and practicality of such reforms, by prioritizing crime reduction, national Democrats can shield electorally vulnerable members of their party against GOP attacks linking Democratic policies to rising crime rates.\n\n\n\nCritically, national Democrats also must make a concerted effort to reject irresponsible bail reform policies, which allow dangerous criminals to go free. This become a signature marker of the current class of liberal district attorneys and is emerging as a major vulnerability for Democrats in 2022.\n\n\n\nEven in deep-blue New York City, nearly two-thirds (64 percent) of voters&nbsp;believe&nbsp;these bail reform policies have resulted in increased crime. As a result, the New York&nbsp;district attorney, as well as those in other liberal cities —&nbsp;Los Angeles,&nbsp;San Francisco&nbsp;and&nbsp;Chicago, among them — have faced significant national blowback, with some even facing recall elections because of these policies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nImmigration is another key issue that Democrats can double down on ahead of the midterms. Given the crisis in our country — both at the border and in terms of the status of millions of hardworking undocumented immigrants — Democrats need to make a visible effort to move to the center on this issue.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOver the past year and a half, Americans have been bombarded with news about&nbsp;record-high&nbsp;illegal border crossings and ICE detention centers&nbsp;over capacity. For their part, Republicans have been successful in tying the border crisis to the Biden administration’s failed policies and to the broader national trend of rising crime.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, progressives have&nbsp;slammed&nbsp;Biden for not making more of an effort to keep his campaign promises to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and protect Dreamers.\n\n\n\nThus, over the next eight weeks, Democrats can advocate for balanced, moderate and targeted immigration policies that secure the border, permanently protect Dreamers and create a pathway to citizenship for more than 11 million undocumented immigrants.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLast Thursday in a&nbsp;speech&nbsp;to the nation, President Biden demonstrated — for the most part — the type of centrist, conciliatory leadership that Democrats need to practice if they hope to maintain midterm momentum.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the current divisions in the U.S., Biden made clear that he was not seeking to demonize all Republicans by calling out the Trump-wing of the party for their attacks on democracy, and said that he hopes to work with the majority of the GOP to find common ground for the sake of the nation.\n\n\n\n“Now, I want to be very clear, very clear upfront. Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans are MAGA Republicans … I know because I’ve been able to work with these mainstream Republicans … I’m an American president, not a president of red America or blue America, but of all America,” Biden said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLater in the speech, he urged the country to build a future that does not dwell on the “past, not on divisive culture wars, not on the politics of grievance,” but on “a future we can build together.”\n\n\n\nWhile other segments of President Biden’s speech were less conciliatory, he largely struck the right tone by appealing to the non-MAGA wing of the Republican party and underscoring the importance of preserving American democracy.\n\n\n\nOver the next eight weeks, it is essential that Democrats&nbsp;communicate an uplifting vision for the future that is focused on addressing the nation’s most pressing issues — inflation, crime and immigration — while also advocating stanchly for protecting abortion rights, safeguarding gay marriage, strengthening gun safety laws and securing American democracy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDouglas E.

        "description": "Photo by Mitchell Layton/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Justin Janas connected for a key three-run homer to propel Augusta to victory.  After an exciting (perhaps too exciting in some ways) walk-off win at the big league level last night over the Marlins, the minor league squads weren’t quite able to match that effort as they went 1-2 on Saturday evening with one postponement down in Mississippi. Justin Janas and Ethan Workinger each had big nights at the plate for Augusta, Hernan Perez had a three-hit night for the Stripers, and the Rome Braves....tried their best. Lets get into the games.\n\nGwinnett Stripers 3, Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp 4 - F/9\nBox Score\n\nHernan Perez, LFL 3-3, 2B, 2 RBI, BB, .734 OPS\nJake Marisnick, DH: 1-4, 3B, .689 OPS\nDarius Vines, SP: 4.2 IP, 4 H, 3 ER, 3 BB, 4 K, 3.24 ERA\n\n\nDarius Vines struggled early in his start on Saturday and the Stripers ultimately fell in extra innings by the score of 4-3. It is worth noting that Friday’s Gwinnett game that was suspended did get completed on Saturday although the score of 7-0 from yesterday’s recap  did not change whatsoever. Just know that Connor Johnstone held down the fort with three scoreless innings. As for the scheduled Saturday game, Darius Vines was on the mound and was really struggling in the first inning, particularly with his command, as the first four batters reached base on two hits and two walks. He did settle down to set down the next three hitters, but not before two runs crossed the plate in the inning. This wasn’t the typical “bad” Vines appearance where he makes mistakes in the zone and gets a couple hit into the next zip code...just wasn’t crisp early. Unfortunately, the Gwinnett bullpen was the one that blinked first in extras as a two-out triple off of Williams Woods (who had struck out the first two batters with the ghost runner on second) ended up driving in the winning run for Jacksonville.\nOffensively, the star for the Stripers was Hernan Perez who went 3-3 with a double while driving in a pair of runs and tacking on a walk as well. Jake Marisnick, who the Braves just acquired for some added quad-A type depth, made his organizational debut and he had a triple for Gwinnett. Pat Valaika had the other multi-hit game for the Stripers as he went 2-4 with a double.\n\nMississippi Braves, Tennessee Smokies - Postponed\nRain sucks\n\nRome Braves 0, Greenville Drive 8\nBox Score\n\nKeshawn Ogans, 2B: 1-4, 2B\nTyler Tolve, C: 1-4, 2B, .733 OPS\nDylan Spain, SP: 4.2 IP, 5 H, 2 ER, 1 BB, 7 K, 5.40 ERA\n\n\nWe won’t linger long here as Rome got routed by Greenville by the final score of 8-0. Dylan Spain got the start for the Rome Braves and he was honestly quite good. While you would probably prefer he at least finish the fifth inning, Spain was a reliever for most of this season and he was largely efficient as he only threw 67 pitches. Moreover, one of the two runs he “gave up” in that fifth inning was on a throwing error by the catcher on a pickoff. Spain was missing bats consistently with seven strikeouts in less than five innings and really didn’t start getting squared up until late in the start....so good job, Dylan. This game stayed relatively close until the ninth inning where Ben Dum gave up five runs and basically quashed any hope of a late inning comeback.\nOffensively, there isn’t a lot to talk about as Rome was shut out and not a single Rome batter had a multi-hit game or even drew a walk. If you are looking for a silver lining, three of Rome’s six hits in the game were for extra bases as Keshawn Ogans, Beau Philip, and Tyler Tolve each had doubles in the game. Cal Conley did have a hot start to his time in Rome, but has cooled off considerably as he has hits in just five of his last 13 games.\n\nAugusta GreenJackets 6, Salem Red Sox 3\nBox Score\n\nJustin Janas, DH: 2-4, HR, 3 RBI, .643 OPS\nEthan Workinger, RF: 2-4, 2B, HR, 2 RBI, .854 OPS\nJR Ritchie, SP: 2 IP, 2 H, 2 ER, 3 BB, 3 K, 3.00 ERA\n\n\nThe bright spot of the Braves farm system on Saturday was the GreenJackets as they powered their way to a 6-3 win over Salem. JR Ritchie was on the mound for Augusta and the Braves’ 35th overall pick in the 2022 draft didn’t have a banner start to the game in the first inning where he allowed the first two batters to reach and both got cashed in on a two-run single, however, he settled down after that and struck out two batters in the second inning before he was taken out. Peyton Williams came in after that for bulk innings and was excellent as he struck out five batters over four scoreless innings which proved to be invaluable for Augusta on Saturday.\nTwo batters for Augusta proved to provide the key swings in this game: Ethan Workinger and Justin Janas. Workinger connected for a two-run homer in the sixth inning that gave Augusta the lead for the first time in the game. Then in the seventh inning, Justin Janas hit his first home run in low-A and it was a three-run shot that gave Augusta plenty of breathing room the rest of the way. Fear not, Nacho Alvarez fans, as Nacho did record a hit the game and he currently sports a .977 OPS in 46 plate appearances in low-A.",

        "description": "Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Braves are getting back Jackson Stephens after a scary incident where he was hit in the head with a line drive No one can say that Bryce Elder didn’t give the Braves exactly what they needed from him in his spot start against the Marlins, but the reality was that it was always going to be a spot start. Barring injury, the Braves current rotation seems to be pretty set and Elder’s time with the big league club was going to be fleeting...at least this time.\nHowever, the corresponding roster move was still worth monitoring as Atlanta seemed to have several options available to them for a fresh arm in the bullpen. Today’s move also happens to give us some clarity as to how one bullpen arm is doing after a scary incident on the field.\n\n\nThe #Braves today reinstated RHP Jackson Stephens from the 7-day injured list after optioning RHP Bryce Elder to Triple-A Gwinnett following last night’s game.— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nJackson Stephens was placed on the 7-day concussion injured list on August 27 after being hit by a line drive in the head. While there wasn’t anything immediately concerning for his long-term health in the aftermath (other than the obvious “he got hit in the head hard by a baseball”), it is still nice to see that he is healthy enough to be cleared to play again. Stephens has struggled of late, but he is also the type of guy the Braves want to be adding with this move as a reliever who can throw multiple innings if need be.\nAs for Elder, he heads back to Gwinnett knowing that his last two starts in the big leagues (both against Miami for what its worth) were gems. He will continue to try and refine his command and try to limit the long ball, the latter of which has been a struggle for him in the minors even lately. However, it certainly seems like the Braves are still looking at him as a rotation option going forward and that is good news for him.",

        "description": "Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) on Sunday said \"mainstream\" Republicans are pushing back against the MAGA wing of the GOP to defend democracy, adding that \"leading conservative voices\" are largely in agreement with Democrats in condemning the attack on the U.S. Capitol and pushing back on claims the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n\n\nDuring an interview with \"Fox News Sunday\" anchor Mike Emanuel, Maloney defended President Biden's primetime speech on Thursday night, when he warned Americans that the nation faces a threat to democracy from \"extremist\" supporters of former President Trump.\n\n\n\n\"The point of that speech is that mainstream Republicans and Democrats agree on things — it's wrong to attack the United States Capitol, to spread a pernicious lie about the election being stolen,\" Maloney, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said. \"I mean, Republicans and Democrats are in large part in agreement.\n\n\n\n\"It's the MAGA movement that is extreme, that has ripped away reproductive freedom, that justifies the attack on the Capitol, that plays footsie with white supremacist and QAnon conspiracy theorists,\" he continued. \"That's what the president was talking about.\"\n\n\n\nBiden delivered the primetime address to Americans after he compared the MAGA movement to \"semi-fascism,\" drawing the ire of GOP leaders who called for him to apologize for the comments.\n\n\n\nHis address last week drew more consternation from the GOP, with top Republicans blasting him as a \"divider-in-chief\" and saying his speech was a \"condescending lecture\" that will further polarize the nation.\n\n\n\nBut Maloney on Sunday noted that some GOP leaders and former members of Trump's administration, including former Attorney General Bill Barr, have spoken out against the claim backed by Trump that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n\n\n\"This is mainstream [Republicans] versus MAGA,\" he said. \"The president has a duty to defend American democracy, and he is in agreement with leading conservative voices. ... This isn't just President Biden.\"",

        "description": "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell said on Sunday there is no timeline for when residents of the city of Jackson, Miss. will have access to drinkable water. \n\n\n\n“I think it's still too early to tell,” Criswell told host Dana Bash on CNN's \"State of the Union. \"I think that having EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers, we had a really good conversation on Friday about what it's going to take in the assessments that they're doing.” \n\n\n\n“And so it's going to happen in phases,” she added. “The focus right now is making sure we can get bottled water out.”\n\n\n\nCriswell visited Jackson on Friday along with the Biden administration’s infrastructure director, Mitch Landrieu, and the city’s mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba (D). \n\n\n\n“We're providing temporary measures to help increase the water pressure so people can at least flush their toilets and use the faucets,” Criswell told Bash on Sunday. \n\n\n\n“The longer term and the midterm about how long it's going to take to actually make it safe to drink, [I] think we have a lot more to learn about what it's going to take to get that plant up and running.” \n\n\n\nMississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R) declared a state of emergency last week over the city's water crisis. \n\n\n\nLumumba told ABC News that water issues in city, which has a majority of Black residents, have been prevalent for decades, citing the lack of capital improvement, required maintenance and human capital to repair its aging system. ",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3626424-seven-races-that-could-decide-the-senate-majority/",
        "description": "Democrats and Republicans are suiting up for a fierce final stretch to the November midterm elections.\n\n\n\nWith Labor Day seen as the unofficial general election kickoff, they have just over two months to win over voters.\n\n\n\nThe upper chamber is split 50-50, but Democrats hold a slight edge over Republicans through Vice President Harris’s tiebreaking vote. That one-woman majority has helped Democrats deliver a number of legislative victories, including a multibillion-dollar climate, tax and health care package.\n\n\n\nThis November, Democrats are looking to expand that majority to tick more tasks off of their agenda, while Republicans are intent on tipping the balance of power in their favor to put a check on Democrats in Washington.\n\n\n\nThese are the seven Senate races that could decide the majority in the upper chamber:\n\n\n\nPennsylvania\n\n\n\nPennsylvania is home to one of the most highly watched Senate contests this cycle, with Republican celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz facing off against Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D) for the seat being vacated by Sen. Pat Toomey (R).\n\n\n\nDemocrats view the race as one of their best pickup opportunities in the upper chamber, and two election forecasters last month moved the race from “toss-up” to “lean Democrat.”\n\n\n\nOz, who was endorsed by former President Trump, won the Republican nomination&nbsp;by just 1,000 votes over former hedge fund CEO David McCormick. Fetterman, who is considered a progressive, easily beat out centrist Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.) for his party’s nomination.\n\n\n\nThe race between the two men has turned personal.\n\n\n\nFetterman has worked for months to portray Oz as a carpetbagger from New Jersey and an out-of-touch television-star-turned-politician, while Oz has tried to put a spotlight on Fetterman’s health.\n\n\n\nThe lieutenant governor suffered a stroke in May, days before the primary, which kept him off the campaign trail for about three months.\n\n\n\nFetterman holds a strong lead over Oz in&nbsp;FiveThirtyEight’s average of polls, 48.3 percent to 40.2 percent.\n\n\n\nOhio\n\n\n\nOhio is hosting a marquee Senate race this cycle, with Rep. Tim Ryan (D) going head-to-head against “Hillbilly Elegy” author and venture capitalist J.D. Vance to replace Sen. Rob Portman (R), who opted not to run for another term.\n\n\n\nVance, who has Trump’s endorsement,&nbsp;bested a crowded field of GOP candidates to win his party’s nomination, while Ryan easily skated onto his party’s ticket.\n\n\n\nRyan, a 10-term congressman and 2020 presidential candidate, is seeking to present himself as a sensible moderate in his quest to win over voters in a state that voted for both Trump and former President Obama twice. He has distanced himself from Biden on some occasions, and previously said he “agreed with Trump on trade.”\n\n\n\nVance, a Trump critic-turned-supporter, touted his closeness to the former president during the primary battle, but then&nbsp;largely&nbsp;dissipated&nbsp;from the spotlight.\n\n\n\nRyan has significantly outraised Vance, raking in $9.1 million in the second quarter compared to Vance’s $2.3 million. Last month, the Senate Leadership Fund —&nbsp;a PAC aligned with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) —&nbsp;funneled $28 million&nbsp;into Ohio for TV and radio ads bolstering Vance.\n\n\n\nRyan holds a razor-thin lead over Vance in&nbsp;FiveThirtyEight’s average of polls, 45.2 percent to 44.6 percent. The seat is rated “lean Republican” by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\n\n\nGeorgia\n\n\n\nAfter winning a nail-biting special election runoff last year that helped Democrats secure their majority in the evenly split upper chamber, Sen. Raphael Warnock (R-Ga.) is back on the ballot with hopes of winning a full term in Congress.\n\n\n\nHis seat was widely viewed as one of the GOP’s best pickup opportunities, but Republicans have been growing concerned over their nominee, former college football Heisman Trophy winner Herschel Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker has been bruised by unforced errors on the campaign trail, revelations regarding his business experience and successes, allegations of domestic abuse and news that he has three previously undisclosed children.\n\n\n\nBut Walker is backed by Trump and Mitch McConnell and has high name recognition in the state.\n\n\n\nOn the money front, Warnock has proven to be a prolific fundraiser, ranking in more than $17.2 million in the second quarter of this year. Walker raised around $6.2 million in the same time period.\n\n\n\nStill, the race remains close, according to&nbsp;FiveThirtyEight’s average of polls, with Warnock currently holding a slight edge over Walker, 46.7 percent to 45 percent.\n\n\n\nThe seat is rated a “toss up” by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\n\n\nArizona\n\n\n\nIn Arizona, Republican venture capitalist Blake Masters is challenging Sen. Mark Kelly (D), who won a special election in 2020 and is now vying for a full term.\n\n\n\nKelly —&nbsp;a retired NASA astronaut who is one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for reelection this cycle —&nbsp;has worked to present himself as a moderate,&nbsp;bucking Biden&nbsp;and his party on a number of occasions throughout his short tenure as a senator.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMasters, who is endorsed by Trump and has support from Republican megadonor Peter Thiel, has put a spotlight on his close ties to Trump and at one point said he would have objected to the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\n\nBut he has appeared to be moderating his tone in recent days, editing his campaign website to soften language regarding his stance on abortion and election .\n\n\n\nKelly has maintained a lead over Masters, according to&nbsp;FiveThirtyEight’s average of polls. He is currently ahead of his GOP challenger, 50.2 percent to 42.4 percent.\n\n\n\nThe seat is rated a “toss up” by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\n\n\nNevada\n\n\n\nNevada is shaping up to be a potential problem for Democrats, with former Attorney General Adam Laxalt (R) mounting a bid against Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D).\n\n\n\nWhile Cortez Masto holds a slight lead, Republicans see the Silver State as a potential pickup opportunity this November. The seat is rated a “toss up” by the Cook Political Report.\n\n\n\nStill, Cortez Masto significantly outraised Laxalt in the second quarter, raking in more than $7.5 million, compared to the Republican’s $2.8 million.\n\n\n\nLaxalt, who is backed by Trump and served as the co-chairman of his reelection campaign in Nevada in 2020, has expressed support for unproven claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump —&nbsp;a stance that Democrats have since seized on.\n\n\n\nWisconsin\n\n\n\nWisconsin is home to another marquee Senate race this cycle, with two-term Sen. Ron Johnson (R) facing a challenge from progressive Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes (D).\n\n\n\nDemocrats see the Badger State race as a seat they can flip. Johnson, a close Trump ally who is known for making controversial comments, is one of the most vulnerable Senate Republicans vying for reelection this cycle.\n\n\n\nHe has gotten wrapped up in the House Jan. 6 select committee’s investigation, drawn headlines for his stance on coronavirus vaccines and most recently, he suggested that Social Security and Medicare should be classified as discretionary spending.\n\n\n\nOn the Democratic side, Barnes has highlighted his parents’ connection to unions, his experience community organizing, his time spent as a state lawmaker and his job serving as lieutenant governor.\n\n\n\nBarnes has come in ahead of Johnson in a few polls last month, but Johnson significantly outperformed Barnes in fundraising during the second quarter, raking in more than $7 million compared to the Democrat’s more than $2.1 million.\n\n\n\nDespite his controversies, Johnson has won two uphill Senate battles, including an upset victory in 2016 after being all but left for politically dead.\n\n\n\nThe seat is rated a “toss up” by the Cook Political Report.\n\n\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n\n\nNew Hampshire holds its primary on Sept. 13, so Democrats don’t yet know who will take on Sen. Maggie Hassan (D) in November. But they do know she’s vulnerable.\n\n\n\nHassan,&nbsp;who was first elected to the Senate in 2016,&nbsp;has made abortion a top issue for her campaign after the Supreme Court overturned the landmark ruling in Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe bucked the Biden administration earlier this year on its plan to end a Trump-era immigration policy —&nbsp;a stance a number of vulnerable moderate senators up for reelection took.\n\n\n\nOn the Republican side, retired Army Gen. Don Bolduc&nbsp;is an early leader&nbsp;of the pack in the primary. In a University of New Hampshire Survey Center Granite State poll conducted last month, Bolduc held a 21 point lead over his closest opponent, state Senate President Chuck Morse.\n\n\n\nBusinessmen Vikram Mansharamani, finance executive Bruce Fenton and former Londonderry Town Manager Kevin Smith are also running for the GOP nod.\n\n\n\nThe race is currently rated “lean Democrat” by the Cook Political Report.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3625065-why-china-is-fuming-over-nasas-artemis-program/",
        "description": "Most of the civilized world is thrilled at the mission of Artemis 1, the NASA-led first step for returning human beings to the lunar surface. The same cannot be said about China.&nbsp;An article in the Global Times, China’s English language mouthpiece, has some snarky things to say about Artemis and NASA in general. The article stated, “as NASA is trying hard to relive its Apollo glories, China is working on innovative plans to carry out its own crewed moon landing missions.”\n\n\n\nThe article accused the United States of fomenting a new space race. “China's crewed moon landing is more in line with scientific principles, but NASA might grow more hostile against China in the space domain given the huge pressure it is facing to maintain its global leadership in moon exploration.”\n\n\n\nA recent CNN article suggests&nbsp;that the Chinese are right when they accuse the United States of conducting a space race. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson referred to such a contest.\n\n\n\nScott Pace, former executive director of the National Space Council and current director of George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, laid out the stakes of the new space race.\n\n\n\n\"It's not just our machines or our people that we send into space. It's our values. It's who we are. It's things like rule of law, democracy, human rights, and a free market economy. I see Artemis and our human expansion into space as a projection of our American values. It's about diplomatically shaping this new domain that we depend on,” Pace said.\n\n\n\nZhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, accused the United States of “smearing” China’s “normal and reasonable outer space endeavors.” We are to believe a country that practices genocide against the Uyghur minority group, threatens Taiwan and engages in cyber espionage along with other clandestine activities around the world plans nothing alarming in space.\n\n\n\nAn old adage states that when you are receiving flack, you are over the target. So, it is with the Chinese complaints about Artemis. The snark with which Chinese officials are greeting Artemis does not demonstrate disdain for the program but more likely fear of the NASA-led international return to the moon effort.\n\n\n\nBeijing knows what happened during the last race to the moon, when the Apollo 11 mission&nbsp;helped the United States win the Cold War. China also knows that&nbsp;soft political power, a nation’s ability to shape world events without direct use of military force, is one of many prizes that can be won by returning to the moon. The Chinese are determined that China and not the United States win that prize.\n\n\n\nHowever, superpower competition for bragging rights is not the most important reason for expanding human civilization into space. Increasingly, human beings depend on a host of technological devices to prosper and survive. Everything from smart phones to electric cars and the technology to power them need natural resources to build and maintain them. Too little of those natural resources exist on Earth to keep the production lines going. Mining operations have environmental consequences that are hard to mitigate.\n\n\n\nMining natural resources&nbsp;from the moon, asteroids and other venues&nbsp;outside Earth will become increasingly important if human civilization is to survive and thrive. Every resource from industrial metals such as iron, aluminum and titanium, to rare earths is out there for the taking. Space is also a source of energy, from sunlight that can be captured by&nbsp;space-based solar power stations&nbsp;and beamed to Earth, to&nbsp;helium-3 mined on the moon&nbsp;and used as fuel in clean-burning fusion power plants.\n\n\n\nBesides the development of an infrastructure to mine, process and transport space resources in an economic manner, the big question is, who will own them?\n\n\n\nThe United States and the other signatories of the Artemis Accords envision a system in which private companies will own the resources they extract, although not the territory they reside on, because of the Outer Space Treaty. These companies will develop space resources and sell them to other companies that will build useful things out of them. This regime will usher forth a new era of abundance and peace.\n\n\n\nIf its behavior on Earth is any indication, China’s approach will be more imperial in its nature. Beijing will not be disposed to share the bounty that space has to offer. It will use control of space resources to dominate the Earth. Such a future should be avoided at all costs.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;Mark&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Whittington&nbsp;is the author&nbsp;of&nbsp;space exploration&nbsp;studies&nbsp;“Why is It So Hard to Go Back to the Moon?”&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;“The Moon, Mars and Beyond,”&nbsp;and&nbsp;“Why is America Going Back to the Moon?”&nbsp;He blogs at&nbsp;Curmudgeons Corner.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Sports Studio Photos/Getty Images\n    \n\n  In 1920, Pipp hit a walk-off home run the hard way. It was quite a moment of hilarity and schadenfreude when back on July 22nd, the Red Sox allowed a inside-the-park grand slam as part of a 28-5 loss to the Blue Jays. If you somehow haven’t seen the play, it was a fairly ridiculous sequence that involved a pretty bad defensive mix up.\nAs funny as it was, the play didn’t end up being that consequential. It took the score from 6-0 to 10-0 in a game where the final score ended up in weird football game territory. Sure, that loss helped put some nails in the coffin of the Red Sox contending chances, but it didn’t exactly swing that particular game.\nI say all of that not only because it’s a funny moment to think about, but also so we can dig into the history books and look at an inside-the-park home run from Yankees’ history that ended up being very consequential.\nIn mid-August 1920, the Yankees were locked in a battle, trying to win their first ever AL pennant. Before the season, they had added Babe Ruth into the fold. While they had been a solid team the year before, the addition of Ruth turned them into a genuine contender.\nAn August 15th win over the Senators took the Yankees to 72-43, just half a game back of Cleveland and the White Sox, who were tied for first. As it happened, they were due to open up a series against Cleveland the very next day. The series opener didn’t go great as they took a 4-3 loss on the 16th, unable to complete a rally after scoring three runs in the ninth.\nHowever, that particular day is known for something more than just a 4-3 game. In the fifth inning of that game, Cleveland’s Ray Chapman was struck in the head by a Carl Mays pitch. After falling unconscious on the field and being taken to the hospital, he died early the next morning. That, understandably cast a pall over proceedings, and the game on the 17th was rescheduled.\nWhen the two teams finally resumed on the 18th, the Yankees took a first inning lead on a Duffy Lewis single, but Cleveland would take the lead after scoring a run each in the fourth, fifth, and sixth innings. While Wally Pipp got one run back on a seventh inning RBI single, the Yankees were still trailing when they came to the plate in the ninth.\nUnfortunately, Ruth was not due up in the inning as he had made the last out of the eighth, but the Yankees still had some chance as 4-5-6 in the lineup were due up. While the #4 hitter Del Pratt grounded out, Lewis recorded his third hit of the day to give the Yankees a shot.\nThat brought Pipp to the plate. With pinch-runner Chick Fewster in for Lewis, Cleveland pitcher Jim Bagby took to the rubber. In the at-bat, Pipp took a Bagby pitch to deep right-center field, evading the Cleveland outfielders. Fewster raced all the way around, as did Pipp. The Yankees first baseman managed to cross the plate in time, giving the Yankees a 4-3 walk-off win on an inside-the-park home run.\nNow, most inside-the-park home runs require some amount of mistakes from the defense, because it typically takes quite a lot for a ball to remain in play long enough for someone to make it all the way around the bases. In the case of Pipp’s, it doesn’t seem like there was. This game was played in the Polo Grounds, the dimensions of which were notably insane for modern baseball sensibilities. The New York Times account of the game also mentions the grass being slippery near the fence. It seems those factors allowed Pipp to race all the way around without much danger, as he reportedly crossed home plate just as the ball was reached second base on the relay home.\nThe win took the Yankees back within a half a game of first, but they failed to take advantage of it. They lost to Cleveland the next day, in the game rescheduled after Chapman’s death. The Yankees went 22-15 after the walk-off win, but it wasn’t enough as they finished two games back of the White Sox and three back of the AL champions Cleveland. In the end, Cleveland won the World Series and dedicated it to Chapman, which is fair enough.\nThe dimensions of Yankee Stadium make it a bit hard for any inside-the-park home run, but I wouldn’t turn down some sort of crazy, walk-off one.\nSources\nhttps://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/1920-schedule-scores.shtml\nhttps://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA192008180.shtml\nNew York Times, August 19, 1920\nhttps://sabr.org/gamesproj/game/august-16-1920-ray-chapman-suffers-fatal-blow-to-his-skull-on-pitch-from-carl-mays/\nhttps://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1920.shtml",

        "description": "Aside from the usual tech revealed at IFA, like televisions and new laptops, another product showcased this year was cause for awe. This consisted of demo stations by the smart home accessory company Eve, which showed their Homekit-enabled smart plugs working with Homekit-incompatible devices like an Alexa speaker and a Google Nest Hub &#x2014; all talking to each other courtesy of Matter.\n\n\n\nGoogle Nest Hub + Eve demo station at IFA 2022Source: The Verge\n\n\nWe have covered &#8220;Matter&#8221; here before, and it is basically a  smart home industry standard&#xA0;that will be leveraging the next-gen connectivity protocol called &#8220;Thread.&#8221; This new standard was developed in collaboration with Amazon, Apple, Samsung SmartThings, and Zigbee as&#xA0;a way to reduce fragmentation and achieve interoperability among smart home devices. Eve is the first company I have seen showing a working demo of Matter and announced an Android app coming soon. The folks over at The Verge were present for this demonstration and stated the following regarding the experience:\n\n\n\nOn the Google table, there was both a Thread-enabled&nbsp;second-generation Nest Hub&nbsp;and a Google Pixel 6 Pro running the Google Home app. First, Felber told the Nest Hub, &#x201C;Ok Google, turn on my lights.&#x201D; The instant the Google smart display recognized the command, the Eve Energy smart plug behind it clicked on the attached light bulb. The smart display had sent a signal to the smart plug over Thread to turn it on, thanks to Matter.Source: The Verge\n\n\n\nThe Matter project proves that amazing things can happen when tech giants put their heads together and collaborate. Matter was originally supposed to be released in late 2020 but has been delayed several times and is now scheduled for fall 2022. Unfortunately, we are now in September, and we still haven&#8217;t seen any products announced that will leverage this technology. Also, according to The Verge, the demo at IFA had issues when it came to running it from an Android phone. Based on this, I think a Fall 2022 launch is unlikely, but I would love to be surprised and see some product launches in October alongside the Pixel 7 and Pixel Watch. \n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

He grew up in Nottingham and won BBC Young Musician 2016, which catapulted him to worldwide fame and an invitation to perform at the wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle in 2018, watched by an estimated two billion people. He has featured on the cover of GQ magazine, won two Classical Brit awards and in 2020 was awarded an MBE. His recording of Elgar’s Cello Concerto with Simon Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra (2020) made history as Kanneh-Mason became the first cellist to reach the UK Official Albums Chart Top 10.He has just been appointed the first Menuhin Visiting Professor of Performance Mentoring at London’s Royal Academy of Music, where he was a student. His new solo album, Song, is out on Decca this Friday. On Saturday he will play Samuel Coleridge-Taylor’s version of the traditional spiritual Deep River (also recorded by his sister Isata on her solo piano album Summertime) at the Last Night of the BBC Proms at the Royal Albert Hall, which is live on Radio 3 and across BBC One and BBC Two.

        "description": "(Young)Though he struggles to match the devastating lead single, Sim reveals new emotional range“Been living with HIV since 17/ Am I hideous?” Even in today’s pop climate, where disclosure of mental and physical ailments is almost demanded, the xx singer Oliver Sim’s directness on Hideous is devastating. Partly because we expect xx members to be taciturn, vague, less explicit, but also due to a rawness in his singing, a strength and fragility he has rarely hinted at before. Nothing else on his solo debut is as powerful – Sim isn’t always the most compelling presence in the xx, and so it proves here. Yet with genius bandmate Jamie xx producing an entire album for the first time since 2017, Hideous Bastard is always an intriguing listen.Sim is gently overcoming his natural reticence, and you feel the weight, on Fruit, of his first use of male pronouns to describe a lover. Yet, apart from a goosebump-raising falsetto from Jimmy Somerville, there are no other voices except samples and Sim himself. Even in the ingenious vocal hall of mirrors on GMT, you slightly miss Romy’s harmonies and their chilly caress. Sim has said this record is inspired by horror films… well, this adds welcome colour to the xx cinematic universe, but it’s no blockbuster.  Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photo by Dylan Buell/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Continuing today, of course. 177 pitchers have logged at least 60 IP so far this season in Major League Baseball, and Cincinnati rookie Nick Lodolo is one of them. Of those 177, only 9 have a larger K/9 than Nick, too - his 11.01 K/9 sandwiched in between the star-studded duo of Shane McLanahan and Corbin Burnes, for what it’s worth.\nHe has accrued 1.3 bWAR in his 13 starts so far this year, the kind of pace that has him on what would be a roughly 3.5 bWAR season had he stayed healthy for the duration. Somewhat quietly, he’s put together a 105 ERA+, and he’s even cleared 7 full innings in two of his last three starts.\nIn a year in which little has gone right for the Reds, Lodolo rounding into form and finishing the season strong would certainly be one thing on which we could all collectively hang our hats. The talent is there, the reputation is there, and he’s finally got a stage where we get to watch him ply his trade, with today’s start against the Colorado Rockies the next opportunity for him to continue working towards the finish of a rock solid rookie campaign.\n(If Mother Nature allows, which is another story...)\nThe Reds host the Rockies and German Marquez at 12:10 PM ET for the first of what should be two games on Sunday, with Chase Anderson starting the second one for whatever reason. That’s a big pile of Sunday baseball between two teams going absolutely nowhere, so be glad you at least have Lodolo on the bump to earn your focus.\nHere’s how they’ll line up for the opener:\nReds Lineup\n\n\nStarters for game one of today's doubleheader.

Fans wore T-shirts reading YOU RAIDED THE WRONG PRESIDENT and THREAT TO DEMOCRACY, in a reference to President Joe Biden’s speech last week in Philadelphia. The audience of thousands screamed in agreement when Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who’s become a regular warm-up act at these rallies, declared that the FBI had “violated our president’s rights.” And later on, the crowd exploded into one resounding, ricocheting jeer when Trump, finally on stage, addressed the matter himself.“There can be no more real example of the very clear threats to American freedom than just a few weeks ago,” the former president said, when “we witnessed one of the most shocking abuses of power we have witnessed from any administration in American history!”Trump is back at the forefront of American politics, just two months ahead of the midterm elections. This time, the former president is in a strange new position: He’s backed into a corner by legal trouble. And his ever-loyal fans have joined him in a defensive crouch. “We came because of the Mar-a-Lago raid,” Mike Rutherford, a truck driver from East Stroudsburg, told me. He sat near the stage in a folding chair alongside his wife, Pat. “We’re here to support him,” Pat said, nodding. “I can’t believe how brave that man is.”Pennsylvania found itself smack-dab in the eye of the midterms hurricane this week. Trump’s rally was intended to give a boost to the flagging campaigns of the gubernatorial candidate and State Senator Doug Mastriano and the Senate candidate Mehmet Oz, both of whom have endorsed Trump’s election lies and received his endorsement in exchange. Just two days ago, Biden spoke 100 miles to the south before an eerily lit Independence Hall, and was more direct in his warnings than he’s been in previous addresses: “Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.” The Darth Vader optics of his speech may have interfered with its intended effect, but Trump and the candidates he’s endorsed are a threat to democracy because they appear to believe in only two kinds of election outcomes: Either they win or the system is rigged.[David Frum: The justification for Biden’s speech]Pennsylvania has become a hub for “Stop the Steal” candidates thanks, in part, to Mastriano, who spoke ahead of Trump on Saturday night. The Republican state senator and former Army colonel was outside the Capitol when rioters broke in on January 6; he helped lead the state efforts to overturn the presidential election in 2020; and he’s been subpoenaed by the January 6 committee for his alleged involvement in organizing an alternate set of Electoral College electors for Trump. (Last week, Mastriano sued the panel to avoid testifying.)Both he and Oz offered versions of their stump speeches and declared solidarity with their party leader in his moment of need on Saturday. Other headliners included Greene, the Georgia representative who’d descended the arena steps earlier in the afternoon as “She’s a Beauty” by the Tubes played over the loudspeakers, and the Pennsylvania congressional candidate Jim Bognet, who quipped that America should hire “87,000 more border patrol agents, not IRS agents!”When Trump emerged shortly after 7 p.m., backed by the usual Lee Greenwood soundtrack, he meandered through his standard repertoire: the Russia investigation “hoax,” Biden’s failures, the death penalty for drug dealers. He even managed to encourage a mass heckling of the press seated in the back of the stadium on at least five occasions. But it was Trump’s FBI comments that got the crowd most riled up. “The FBI and the Justice Department have become vicious monsters, controlled by radical-left scoundrels, lawyers, and the media, who tell them what to do,” he told them. Audience members whooped, and a few shouted out “Defund the FBI!”The Trump’s fans I’d spoken with earlier, standing near the Dippin’ Dots ice-cream stall and in line for Chickie’s &amp; Pete’s chicken cutlets, all had his back. “It’s politically motivated,” Jim Shaw, a barber from New Milford, told me when I asked what he made of the search at Mar-a-Lago. “If Donald Trump wasn’t looking like he was the [leading] Republican candidate for president, I don’t think it would have happened.” Every one of the dozen or so people I talked with offered some defense of the former president: The search was a setup; the evidence was planted; Biden’s DOJ was trampling on Trump’s constitutional rights to keep him from running for office again.[Read: ‘Stop the Steal’ is a metaphor]I detected a touch of desperation in many people’s responses—a sense that, if Trump-endorsed candidates don’t win in November, America as they know it will cease to exist. Here in northeast Pennsylvania—just 20 miles down the road from Biden’s hometown—was a gathering of people not just pessimistic about the future of the country under his leadership, but deeply fearful too. “At this point right now, I’m worried about being targeted by the FBI because I’m a Christian, I’m conservative,” Pat Rutherford said. “I know they won’t find anything, but I am going to need a lawyer to prove I am innocent.” The DOJ “is like a militia for the Democrats,” Linda Hess, from Selinsgrove, told me. “I think our First Amendment rights are basically gone as conservatives. I really do.”Trump and his loyalists are eager to fan these fears. “Your president called all of you extremists!” Greene told the rally when she was on stage. “Joe Biden has declared that half of this country are enemies of the state!” (The president, in fact, made a clear distinction: “Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans.”) “Save us, Trump!” one woman yelled from the crowd during his speech.Fear can be a winning political tactic. It helped candidates like Mastriano sail to victory in the Republican primary. But general elections are different. The president’s party usually fares poorly in the midterms cycle, and just a few weeks ago, the fundamentals would have indicated that Republicans were about to have an excellent November. Recently, though, the numbers have shifted in the Democrats’ favor. Inflation is down, and so are gas prices; new job numbers are high, and unemployment is still low; and Democrats are already seeing signs that their voters are highly motivated by the overturning of Roe v. Wade. In the latest polls, both Mastriano and Oz are trailing their respective Democratic opponents, Josh Shapiro and John Fetterman.Still, 10 weeks is a long time in American politics. Republicans could gain back an edge between now and then. Some experts predict that both races will probably end up much closer than they are now. The risks of electing an election denier such as Mastriano are clear: As governor, he’d have the power to appoint the secretary of state, and together, the two officials could muddy the waters after a close election or, allied with the Republican-dominated state legislature, even change election rules to benefit their party.That danger extends far beyond the Keystone State. Other “Stop the Steal” candidates are running all over the country. In 2020 battleground states, candidates who’ve endorsed Trump’s lies about election fraud have won nearly two-thirds of GOP nominations for state and federal offices with election-oversight powers, according to a Washington Post analysis.[Read: The radical fringe that just went mainstream in Arizona]Whether these specific candidates win or lose, election denial has become the most important litmus test for the MAGA base. “Stop the Steal” is an expression of a deepening distrust in government and institutions—a mantra to remind its adherents that they, not their political opponents, are the rightful inheritors of America. The phrase is a metaphor, the sociologist Theda Skocpol told me last month, “for the country being taken away from the people who think they should rightfully be setting the tone.”When their candidates lose, it can be only through trickery. When their leader is investigated for squirreling away cartons of national secrets at his country club, it’s a targeted attack by the “Regime,” to use Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis’s word—and capitalization.After Mastriano had finished speaking, and before Trump took to the stage, an elderly white man stood up behind me and shouted, “Whose country is this?” The people nearby in the bleachers joined him in response: “It’s our country!” Later, Trump affirmed the sentiment. “No matter how big or powerful these corrupt radicals may be, you must never forget that this nation does not belong to them,” he told his supporters. “This nation belongs to you!” The people in the stadium roared their approval.",

        "description": "Dylan Cease had fans on their feet, hoping he would get that final out and complete the no-hitter.The White Sox&#x27;s ace would have loved nothing more than to deliver. Instead, his bid ended just a little short.Cease came within one out of his first career no-hitter, and the streaking Chicago White Sox pounded the Minnesota Twins 13-0 on Saturday night.Cease got a huge ovation when he came out to start the ninth. With fans standing, he struck out Caleb Hamilton swinging on a 1-2 slider and retired Gilberto Celestino on a fly to center.Luis Arraez, who leads the American League with a .318 average, then dumped a line-drive single into right-center on a 1-1 pitch, ending Cease&#x27;s bid for Chicago&#x27;s third no-hitter in as many years. Lucas Giolito tossed one against Pittsburgh in 2020, and Carlos Rodón did it against Cleveland on April 14, 2021.“Obviously, it&#x27;s disappointing,” Cease said. “But that&#x27;s the game.”After a meeting on the mound, Cease struck out Kyle Garlick to finish his first career nine-inning complete game. He threw a seven-inning shutout against Detroit in 2021.Teammates lined up outside the dugout and high-fived Cease as he walked off. Fans chanted “Cease! Cease!” during a TV interview and showered him with more cheers as he left.“It would have meant a lot,” Cease said. “It&#x27;s obviously an incredibly difficult feat to achieve. It definitely would have meant a lot.”Cease said he didn&#x27;t feel he had his sharpest stuff in the early going. He didn&#x27;t strike out anyone until the fifth inning, but wound up with seven in the game. The right-hander threw 103 pitches, 68 for strikes.Cease walked Jake Cave in the third and Gilberto Celestino in the sixth for Minnesota’s only other baserunners. Cave was erased when Gary Sanchez bounced into a double play. Celestino was stranded when Cease struck out Arraez.Catcher Seby Zavala said he started thinking about a no-hitter in the third inning.“I started counting outs,&quot; he said. “I felt like we had something going on.”Minnesota&#x27;s Gio Urshela said Arraez was just the person to break up the bid.“Yeah, he’s the perfect guy for that situation if you want to break a no-hitter,” he said. &quot;That was the perfect guy for that.”Earlier, Eloy Jiménez, Romy Gonzalez and Elvis Andrus homered as the White Sox rolled to their fourth straight win after losing 10 of 12. The defending AL Central champions moved within two games of division leader Cleveland and one of second-place Minnesota.“Obviously, this shows how much fight we still have in us,” Cease said.Jiménez connected for a three-run shot in the first against Tyler Mahle (6-8). Gonzalez added his first career homer in the fourth, a three-run shot off Aaron Sanchez. Elvis Andrus tacked on a grand slam against position player Nick Gordon in the eighth.Following his memorable drive, Gonzalez had a big grin as he bumped forearms with Josh Harrison after crossing the plate and traded high fives with teammates in the dugout.Chicago is 4-1 with bench coach Miguel Cairo filling in for ailing manager Tony La Russa. The Hall of Fame skipper is in Arizona tending to an unspecified medical condition.The Twins lost their third straight after winning five in a row. They also dropped their seventh consecutive road game.Mahle lasted two innings in his first start since Aug. 17. The right-hander exited because of inflammation in his right shoulder — the same injury that had sidelined him.Up nextThe series wraps up with White Sox RHP Lucas Giolito (10-8, 5.27 ERA) opposing Minnesota RHP Dylan Bundy (7-6, 4.53 ERA). Giolito is 1-2 with a 7.98 ERA in his past three starts. Bundy has dominated the White Sox, with a career 6-0 record and 3.47 ERA in eight starts and nine appearances. He is 2-0 with a 2.35 ERA in three starts against them this year.",

        "description": "Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  A pair of relievers continued their progress towards possibly giving the Dodgers options in the bullpen later this month and maybe into the postseason. Tommy Kahnle and Danny Duffy each tossed an inning for Oklahoma City on Saturday.\nKahnle faced four batters in the sixth inning, striking out one and inducing two groundouts that had a solo home run in between. The right-hander has allowed runs in two of the four appearances since joining OKC in late August. Kahnle hasn’t pitched in the major leagues since the middle of May and has only appeared in five games at that level since the end of the 2019 season.\nDuffy allowed a single and a walk to start the seventh inning but got the next three hitters to get out of the inning unscathed. The lefty was making his second appearance with Oklahoma City and pitched in a total of five games at three different levels since August 20. Duffy has yet to pitch for the Dodgers at the major league level after they acquired him at the trade deadline last season.\nPlayer of the day\nRyan Ward reached base four times and drove in three runs for Tulsa Saturday. The 24-year-old singled in a run in the first and singled in two more in the second to give the Drillers an early lead. \n\n\nSo nice, he had to do it twice!  @rwardo12 delivers his second RBI single of the game, Drillers ⬆️ 3-0 in the 2nd. pic.twitter.com/gApnyDgRxO— Tulsa Drillers (@TulsaDrillers) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nWard would later walk twice and score a run to extend the lead at the time for the Drillers. \nTriple-A Oklahoma City\nOklahoma City had a three-run lead entering the bottom of the ninth but couldn’t hang on. Each team scored several times in extra innings before Round Rock (Rangers) came out on top, handing the Dodgers an 8-7 loss in walk-off fashion.\nThe Dodgers had a 4-1 lead melt away in the ninth when they allowed a run to score on a wild pitch and a the tying runs to cross on a two-run single from Sam Huff. It was Huff who hit the solo homer off Kahnle earlier in the game and he wasn’t done being a menace to OKC pitching.\nJames Outman singled in a pair in the top of the 10th only to have the Express score two of their own to force an 11th. After the Dodgers scored another run in their half on an Andy Burns double play ball, Huff tied it in the bottom half on a single and Round Rock closed it out on an infield chopper that allowed the winning run to score from third.\nEdwin Ríos was 2-for-4 with a solo homer that started the scoring in the fourth. There were four others that had multi-hit nights, including Michael Busch (2-for-4) and Jacob Amaya (3-for-5).\n\n\nIn Edwin Rios' first at-bat, he crushed a ball that ended up as a 402-foot out.This at-bat did not result in an out. Dodgers in front, 1-0. pic.twitter.com/r55NQn90qd— Oklahoma City Dodgers (@okc_dodgers) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nJon Duplantier started the game for the Dodgers on the mound and held the Express without a run for five innings, giving up just one hit while walking five with five strikeouts.\nDouble-A Tulsa\nThe Drillers had a 5-1 lead heading to the sixth inning Saturday but gave up a pair of three-run innings late to drop an 8-6 game to Northwest Arkansas (Royals).\nAfter scoring three in the sixth to bring themselves within one, the Naturals got a solo homer from Morgan McCullough in the seventh to tie it. Tyler Gentry would then untie it in the top of the ninth with a three-run homer to ultimately bury Tulsa.\nTulsa got a run-scoring single from Brandon Lewis and had the bases loaded in the ninth but Ryan January struck out to end the threat and the game.\nAs discussed above, Ward played a big part early on to drive in the first three runs of the game and he scored the fourth run in the fifth when January singled in a pair. Leonel Valera was 2-for-4 in the leadoff spot for Tulsa, scoring on both of Ward’s singles.\nHigh-A Great Lakes\n\n\nTonight's game against the Lake County Captains has been postponed.         ,                     ,                -                                   :                          :    . pic.twitter.com/m9G9cCsptm— Great Lakes Loons (@greatlakesloons) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nLow-A Rancho Cucamonga\nRancho was done in by a pair of big innings for Inland Empire (Angels) Saturday. The Quakes allowed four runs in the first inning and three in the fifth on their way to an 8-4 loss on the road.\nThe loss drops Rancho six games behind Inland Empire in the second-half standings with seven games to go. This series was make or break for the Quakes to try and catch the 66ers but they've lost three of the five so far.\nA Yeiner Fernandez two-run single in the first and a Kyle Froemke RBI-single in the fifth brought Rancho within two runs each time but it wasn’t enough to keep pace with the 66ers.\nFroemke didn’t start the game but had to come in when Dalton Rushing was ejected by the home plate umpire while arguing a called third strike in the third inning.\nMaddux Bruns was activated before the game to make the start for Rancho and he would exit before ever recording an out. He walked four of the five he face and gave up a single to the other while being charged with all four runs in the first inning.\nTransactions\nHigh-A: LHP Christian Suarez assigned to Great Lakes Loons from Rancho Cucamonga Quakes.\nLow-A: Rancho Cucamonga Quakes activated LHP Maddux Bruns.\nSaturday scores\n\nRound Rock 8, Oklahoma City 7 (F/11)\nNorthwest Arkansas 8, Tulsa 6\nGreat Lakes vs. Lake County (postponed)\nInland Empire 8, Rancho Cucamonga 4\n\nSunday Schedule\n\n9:05 a.m. PT: Great Lakes (Ronan Kopp) vs. Lake County (Aaron Davenport)\nGame 2: Great Lakes (Kendall Williams) vs. Lake County (Jack Leftwich)\n11:05 a.m.: Oklahoma City (Michael Grove) at Round Rock (Cole Winn)\n4:05 p.m.: Tulsa (Nick Nastrini) vs. Northwest Arkansas (Alec Marsh)\n5:35 p.m.: Rancho Cucamonga (Peter Heubeck) at Inland Empire (Joey Walsh)",

President Trump on Saturday called President Biden \"an enemy of the state\" in response to a primetime speech in which Biden called Republicans influenced by Trump a \"threat\" to democracy.\n\n\n\n\"This week, Joe Biden came to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to give the most vicious, hateful and divisive speech ever delivered by an American president,\" Trump said, adding that Biden vilified the more than 70 million people who voted for the GOP nominee in 2020. \"As threats to democracy and as enemies of the state, you're all enemies of the state,\" he said gesturing to his supporters. \"He's an enemy of the state.\"\n\n\n\nTrump made the remarks at his first rally since the Aug. 8 FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago property. He came to Pennsylvania to rally for GOP Senate candidate Mehmet Oz and gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano. \n\n\n\n\"Two months from now the people of Pennsylvania are going to fire the radical left Democrats and you are going to elect Doug Mastriano as your next governor, and you are going to send my friend Oz, he is a great guy, to the US Senate,\" the former president said. \"You're going to elect an amazing slate of true America first Republicans to Congress.\"\n\n\n\nBut Trump also made Biden the focus of his rally, in which he also criticized the FBI and the Department of Justice, who are investigating the former president and his handling of hundreds of classified documents, some of which were designated top secret in possible violations of the Espionage Act as well as other federal laws.\n\n\n\n“The FBI and the Justice Department have become vicious monsters, controlled by radical left scoundrels, lawyers and the media, who tell them what to do,” Trump said.\n\n\n\nBiden spoke Thursday night from Philadelphia, where he tied Trump and other so-called “MAGA Republicans” to the spread of conspiracy theories and casting doubt on the presidential election.\n\n\n\n“Not every Republican, not even a majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology,” Biden said. “But there’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.”\n\n\n\nTrump also called the FBI search at&nbsp;his Mar-a-Lago home an example of \"the very real threats of American freedom.\"\n\n\n\n\"There could be no more vivid example of the very real threats of American freedom than just a few weeks ago you saw when we witnessed one of the most shocking abuses of power by any administration in American history,\" Trump said. \"The shameful raid and breaking of my home Mar-a-Lago was a travesty of justice.\"",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3628616-will-joe-manchin-run-for-president/",
        "description": "With President Biden and Donald Trump currently the most likely nominees of their respective parties and remarkably unpopular, it seems the presidency could be up for grabs in 2024. Could Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) make a bid for the White House? And would it work?\n\n\n\nUntil Manchin’s agreement to support the improbably named “Inflation Reduction Act,” his actions during the Biden administration looked like any Democratic Senator in a conservative state trying to thread the needle for re-election. After winning several statewide elections by comfortable margins, Manchin only won re-election in 2018 by less than 4 points and failed to top 50 percent. Worse, Manchin ran over 20 points behind his Republican colleague, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.).\n\n\n\nOpposing much of Biden’s agenda in 2021 made Manchin popular with Republicans but severely damaged his standing with Democrats. According to a Morning Consult West Virginia poll, his approval among Democrats fell from 63 percent down to 44 percent from early 2021 to April of 2022, while his approval among Republicans shot up from 35 percent to 69 percent. His overall approval in West Virginia went from 51 percent to 57 percent.\n\n\n\nBased on that early polling, it looked like Manchin had successfully positioned himself to survive re-election in a Republican state, with only a potential Democratic primary challenge to worry about. However, given the extreme unlikelihood of any Democrat other than Manchin keeping the seat, it would seem improbable that Democrats would throw Manchin overboard.\n\n\n\nNo more country roads\n\n\n\nWhy would Manchin not run for re-election and instead tilt at the presidential windmill?\n\n\n\nPerhaps because his time as a D.C. power broker is likely coming to an end.\n\n\n\nIf Republicans take the Senate majority, Manchin is just a minority senator with little leverage. Lost in all the RINO insults hurled at Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) is the fact that both have generally stuck with their GOP colleagues. Manchin may have little to no leverage with a Republican majority.\n\n\n\nManchin only matters to the Democrats when they need his vote. His centrist views are anathema to the leftist ‘intelligentsia’ and activists who dominate party leadership. If Democrats pick up one seat, they can play Manchin off against their other thorn, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.). A two-seat gain for Democrats ends even that leverage.\n\n\n\nThere is nothing worse in politics than the abrupt shift from powerful to irrelevant.\n\n\n\nBut a run for president could be just the tonic.\n\n\n\nThe question for Manchin would be whether to run in a Democratic primary or to run as an independent straight out of the gate. If he were to choose the independent route, he most likely would be running to make a statement rather than making a legitimate bid for Oval Office.\n\n\n\nThe record of third party/independent candidacies is pretty poor. A candidate from a new party has never won the presidency since at least before the Civil War. The best performance was Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, who finished second and managed to throw the election to the execrable Woodrow Wilson. Since that election, no independent has so much as carried a state, except for purely regional candidates in 1924, 1948 and 1968. The best a national candidate has done was Ross Perot in 1992, managing 18.9 percent of the popular vote and almost winning Maine.\n\n\n\nManchin might be able to finagle the nomination of the embryonic Forward Party, giving him some semblance of organization and fundraising. And he would be a perfect fit, given that the Forward Party appears to be half attitude, half McKinsey-style consulting firm and totally searching for an actual identity.\n\n\n\nManchin might even get some real traction with voters.\n\n\n\nPerhaps in a race between an 81-year-old Biden and a 78-year-old Trump, voters will opt for the relative youth and vigor of a 77-year-old Manchin.\n\n\n\nThe reality of an independent bid is Manchin in the public spotlight, with his rhetoric forcing both major party nominees to react. Manchin would be a spoiler candidate with the ability to tip the race. He would most certainly cost either the Democrats or the Republicans the White House, at least that is what the eventual loser will say.\n\n\n\nThe end for Joe Biden?\n\n\n\nA more interesting alternative is a Manchin bid for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\n\nManchin announcing for president would almost certainly be the end for Biden’s re-election hopes.\n\n\n\nWhile Democratic voters are not necessarily thirsting for Manchin, they are looking for someone other than Biden. Only 37 percent of Democrats want Biden to run again in a recent YouGov poll, making his 84 percent approval rating with his fellow partisans looking quite hollow.\n\n\n\nOut of touch with the loudest segment of the party, Manchin could bet on appealing to moderate and more centrist Democratic voters — or even to voters repelled by the rancor that is endemic on the progressive left. More so, he could position himself as a winner. After all, Biden swept the Democratic field primarily based on a fear that the other candidates could not beat Trump.\n\n\n\nToday, the script has flipped for Biden. Trump, in spite of his continued buffoonery and mounting legal problems, is now leading Biden in several state and national polls. Biden’s national approval remains stubbornly stuck in the low 40s. Vice President Kamala Harris looks like hardly a better option with an even worse approval rating than Biden, 6 points lower in the YouGov poll.\n\n\n\nPerhaps Manchin figures he could win if facing a scrum of hard-core progressives and a stumbling Vice-President. He would have a difficult time of it. The Democratic primary process, while improved for moderates in that it has whittled away many of the activist-dominated caucuses, remains trouble for a candidate who cannot get majorities. The proportional allocation of delegates is set up for a long primary process, provided multiple candidates can maintain some strength.\n\n\n\nWith Manchin so detested by the liberals, it seems highly unlikely their favorites would slowly bow out as Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) did for Biden. As sitting vice president, even a wooden candidate like Kamala Harris should be able to last. That could lead to a brokered convention, where it seems likely the progressives would sort things out amongst themselves and leave Manchin out in the cold.\n\n\n\nA Manchin candidacy looks to be akin to Eugene McCarthy’s 1968 challenge to Lyndon Johnson — ultimately quixotic, but the start of a feeding frenzy that brings down an unpopular incumbent.\n\n\n\nAnd that just might be the goal for Manchin.\n\n\n\nWill he decide to get the last laugh on the Biden administration and their attacks on him by bringing down the whole edifice?\n\n\n\nIn a last twist of fate, a collapse of Biden’s re-election hopes could be the path for a truly progressive Democratic nominee. And wouldn’t that be the ultimate irony? Joe Manchin, bete noire of the liberals, hands the left just what they want.\n\n\n\nKeith Naughton, Ph.D., is co-founder of Silent Majority Strategies, a public and regulatory affairs consulting firm.

        "description": "On Saturday night, we saw the clearest evidence yet of Dylan Cease’s leap from great to elite.  | Chase Agnello-Dean/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Looking for some fun numbers from Cease’s one-hitter? You’ve come to the right place 0\nDylan Cease has never received a Cy Young vote in his career.\n1\nSaturday’s one-hitter was the first nine-inning complete game of Cease’s career.\n1.23\nCease’s ERA over his last 18 starts is 1.23 — that’s 15 earned runs in 18 games.\n3\nIn his last two starts, covering 17 innings, Cease has given up three hits.\n4.7\nAfter Saturday’s masterpiece, Dylan leads all AL pitchers, with 4.7 rWAR. Eloy Jiménez, considered the headliner of the trade that brought both he and Cease to the White Sox, has 4.8 rWAR — in his entire career.\n6.30\nIn his career prior to Saturday’s game, Cease had a career 6.30 ERA vs. Minnesota — tied with the Houston Astros for his toughest opponent among those he’s faced more than once.\n7\nCease did have one prior, official complete game — a seven-inning doubleheader game in 2021. (Recall that the MLB rules in 2020-21 for doubleheaders were to reduce both games to seven innings.)\n\n8 2⁄3 \n\nDylan didn’t just have a one-hitter, he lost his no-hitter in just about the most excruciating way possible, with two outs in the ninth inning. \n19\nCease is now 13-6 on the season, but the White Sox are 19-8 in games he has started — which means the White Sox are 48-58 in games Dylan sits out.\n90\nThe 90 game score in Saturday’s game was the highest of Cease’s career. He is averaging a 62 game score for the season, which is stellar.\n100.7\nLuis Arráez’s single to break up the no-hitter was no cheap shot, hit at 100.7 mph with a .640 expected batting average.\n103\nIn both Saturday’s one-hitter and Cease’s previous start, an eight-inning effort vs. Arizona, he threw 103 pitches.\n1915\nPer STATS, Inc., Cease is the first MLB pitcher with four games in a season of six-plus shutout innings and no more than one hit since Pete (Grover Cleveland) Alexander in 107 years ago.\n1976\nThe last White Sox pitcher who lost a no-hitter at the 27th-out mark was Ken Brett, vs. the California Angels, 46 years ago.",

        "description": "The Rangers announced that left-hander Dallas Keuchel has been designated for assignment.  Left-hander John King was called up from Triple-A to take Keuchel&#8217;s spot on the active roster.\nKeuchel was signed to a minor league deal in late July, and his contract was officially selected to the big league roster on August 27.  Unfortunately for Keuchel, his two starts in a Texas uniform were disasters, as he allowed seven runs in each outing and has a 12.60 ERA to show for his 10 innings as a Ranger.\nIt has been a rough season overall for the 34-year-old, who has a 9.20 ERA over 60 2/3 cumulative innings with the Rangers, Diamondbacks, and White Sox.  Beginning the season in Chicago, Keuchel struggled to the point that he was released in late May, with the Sox eating the approximate $13MM still owed to Keuchel in the final year of his three-year, $55.5MM contract.\nThe D&#8217;Backs and Rangers therefore only had to pay Keuchel the prorated portion of a Major League minimum salary during his brief time on their active rosters, as the White Sox covered the rest of the bill.  It was a low-cost risk for the two clubs to see if Keuchel could benefit from a change of scenery, yet the veteran struggled at every stop.\nWhile there has long been speculation about how long Keuchel&#8217;s ground-heavy, low-strikeout approach would continue to be successful, the lefty was still a front-of-the-rotation arm as recently as 2020, when he finished fifth in AL Cy Young Award voting in his first season with the White Sox.  However, Keuchel&#8217;s numbers already declined considerably in 2021, as he started to allow considerably more hard contact and his walk rate fell.  Those problems have only deepened in 2022, with Keuchel&#8217;s 10.2% walk rate falling in only the 20th percentile of all pitchers.\nIt seems a given that Keuchel will pass through waivers again, and it seems likely that the Rangers will release him rather than outright him to Triple-A.  The southpaw&#8217;s career track record could land him another minors contract during the offseason, yet as he approaches what would be his age-35 season, the possibility exists that Keuchel is simply no longer an effective Major League pitcher.  Retirement could be a possibility after 11 MLB seasons, but with that 2020 performance still so recent, it also wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to see Keuchel keep grinding to see if he could get his career back on track.",

        "description": "This complete collection of the Brazilian writer’s newspaper columns, translated into English for the first time, shows her insightful engagement with humanity, politics and literature From the age of seven, Clarice Lispector declared in a 1967 column for the newspaper Jornal do Brasil, she knew she was born to write. And write Lispector did. In a life foreshortened by illness – she died at the age of 56 – she wrote with impatient, impassioned energy, winning early fame for her short stories and novels. But it was her chronicles (crônicas) – newspaper columns published between 1967 and her death in 1977 and now translated into English for the first time – that made the Brazilian novelist a household name.Lispector was a successful journalist, but not a conventional one. Too Much of Life works in almost uninterrupted continuity with the writer’s fiction – stylistically and otherwise. Like her posthumous masterpiece, The Hour of the Star, her columns straddle realism, memoir, philosophy and politics, each dependent upon – and obscuring – the other. Continue reading...",

A lawyer for Trump &#8216;offered no explanation as to why boxes of government records&#8217; were being kept at the former president’s estate, the Department of Justice wrote in a court filing last week.&nbsp; But Trump himself invoked something that advisers say rarely comes up: his library.&#8221;\nHowever, as Axios reports, Trump was required to return all documents marked as classified as part of a grand jury subpoena issued in May, regardless of whether or not the former president believed he&#8217;d declassified the documents.",

This issue is hard to control in this age of hybrid work and workers using different types of equipment in their home offices, causing discrepancies in volume.\n\n\n\nGoogle is looking to remedy this situation by automatically adjusting the audio of all meeting participants and thus ensuring that everyone&#8217;s audio input is equally loud. The feature will only work if noise cancellation is on, which helps filter out background noises such as typing, ambient sounds, or room echo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoise cancellation can be turned on or off before or during a meeting and works on desktops, Android, and iOS. To turn it on before your meeting starts, go to meet.google.com, select your meeting, and before you click &#8220;Join,&#8221; click on &#8220;More Options&#8221; on the top right. Next, click on Settings &gt; Audio &gt; turn on Noise cancellation, and proceed to join the meeting.

        "description": "Our kids are back to school next Wednesday, so I&#8217;m in a liminal time between coming back from holiday and feeling like I&#8217;m &#8216;properly&#8217; back at work. In addition, this past week included a Bank Holiday, which Team Belshaw spent a good chunk of at Lane7 in Newcastle. \n\n\n\nA lot of what I&#8217;ve done this week has felt like catching up with things and end-of-month admin. I&#8217;ve followed-up potential work, had some conversations which may or may not lead to something, did some thinking with Ivan and Mayel about Bonfire user research, and got my head into existing client work. \n\n\n\nI&#8217;ve been thinking recently about tracking my fitness, and asked if there was a Fediverse instance dedicated to exercise? It turns out there isn&#8217;t, so I&#8217;m currently looking into creating one. (That post features an image I created using DALL-E 2, which I&#8217;ve had a lot of fun with this week!)\n\n\n\nI was hoping to go camping on Friday night, to recapture some of the microadventuring magic from last September. However, I had a weird&#8230; &#8216;turn&#8217; on Friday morning. Without going into undue detail, my vision, hearing, balance, and co-ordination were affected for about 5-10 minutes after waking up. After that I was fine, but understandably felt a bit delicate. Going camping somewhere without mobile phone signal didn&#8217;t seem sensible.\n\n\n\nThankfully, that incident didn&#8217;t stop me doing some sprinting on Saturday, and going for a run and to the gym today. Talking of the gym, our 11 year-old daughter has joined as she wants to develop her upper body strength to hold off defenders. (It might sound young, but she&#8217;s tall and mature for her age.) She&#8217;s got her second trial for Newcastle United&#8217;s new Emerging Talent Centre on Friday, and yesterday won player of the match as she scored two on her league debut for her new team.  \n\n\n\nNext week is almost back to normal, although it features the kids going back to school, our 19th wedding anniversary, and my wife Hannah working her new pattern of four days per week. She&#8217;s changed teams for NHS Digital, and so took the opportunity to reduce her workload slightly. I&#8217;m going to get my head into some user research for some work that WAO are doing in collaboration with Happy Porch and Common Knowledge for the Wellbeing Economy Alliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of the arcade machines downstairs at Lane7 in NewcastleThe post Weeknote 35/2022 first appeared on Open Thinkering.",

        "description": "Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Another loss in St. Louis In the first half of the season, the Cubs held their own against the Cardinals, despite the Cards being the far better team. But over the last two months, particularly in St. Louis, the Cubs have been completely overmatched. For the second straight night the Cubs allowed eight runs and for any team that’s a near certain recipe for losing. You just can’t allow that many runs night in and night out. \nThe offense put up a fight in this one, plating four runs. That isn’t a world beating number, but you are going to be competitive when you score at least four runs. Probably the most frustrating thing about this one was that the Cubs scored three in the top of the first. On the one hand, they had Adam Wainwright on the ropes in the first. On the other, they gave Drew Smyly a comfortable cushion before he ever want on the hill. \nAlas, Smyly had one of his worse starts as a Cub and Wainwright battled through four more innings and only allowed one more run. The Cardinals bullpen allowed a single hit and a single walk over the final four innings and only needed 13 batters to record the final 12 outs. \nJeremiah Estrada was the first Cub into the game, inheriting the bases loaded in a 4-3 game. He allowed all three of those runs to score (on a Yadier Molina double) and then allowed one of his own. But, four Cubs relievers combined to hold the Cardinals scoreless over five innings of work. \nAmazingly, this game was 8-3 after only three innings and the final score was 8-4. The first three innings looked like this one would  be a wild one, but then both bullpens really shut it down. \nEven in defeat, we can find some positives. Let’s look at three from Saturday night’s loss. \n\nIan Happ had a pair of hits, including a double, and scored two runs. \nFranmil Reyes had a pair of hits and a pair of RBI to go with. \nRafael Ortega only had three at bats before leaving for a pinch hitter, but managed a pair of hits and a pair of RBI. \n\nUnfortunately, Nico Hoerner and Nick Madrigal supplied most of the baserunners Friday night, but were both hitless and hit into a double play Saturday. The Cubs hit into four double plays or this one might have been a different game. \nLet’s take a look at the Heroes and Goats from Saturday’s loss. \nGame 133, September 3: Cardinals 8, Cubs 4 (56-77)\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs\n  \nReminder: Heroes and Goats are determined by WPA scores and are in no way subjective.\nTHREE HEROES:\n\n\nSuperhero: Rafael Ortega (.158). 2-3, 2RBI\n\nHero: Franmil Reyes (.089). 2-4, 2RBI, DP\n\nSidekick: Ian Happ (.040). 2-3, 2B, 2R, HBP\n\nTHREE GOATS:\n\n\nBilly Goat: Drew Smyly (-.429). 2⅓ IP (15 batters), 5H, 3BB, 7R, 3K (L 5-8)\n\nGoat: Jeremiah Estrada (-.170). ⅔ IP (4 batters), H, BB, R\n\nKid: Nico Hoerner (-.103). 0-4, R, SB, DP\n\nWPA Play of the Game: Paul Goldschmidt’s two-run homer in the first off of Drew Smyly came with one out and cut the Cardinals deficit to one. (.164)\n*Cubs Play of the Game: Rafael Ortega’s two-out, two-run single in the first inning off of Adam Wainwright to give the Cubs a 3-0 lead. (.152)\n-Yadier Molina’s bases-clearing double may have been the big blow of the game, but was worth .150. The big difference is that with the bases loaded and one out, the win expectancy had already been tilting towards the Cardinals even before Molina’s double. \n\nRizzo Award Cumulative Standings: (Top 5/Bottom 5)\nThe award is named for Anthony Rizzo, who finished first in this category three of the first four years it was in existence and four times overall. He also recorded the highest season total ever at +65.5. The point scale is three points for a Superhero down to negative three points for a Billy Goat.\n\nDavid Robertson +22.5\nScott Effross +17\nNico Hoerner +16.5\nChristopher Morel +15\nPatrick Wisdom +13.5\nDaniel Norris/Frank Schwindel/Rowan Wick -9.5\nYan Gomes -12\nRafael Ortega -13.5\nJason Heyward -15.5\n\n*Nico Hoerner continues to slip. There is plenty of time left, but it’s starting to look less likely that he (or Christopher Morel) will chase down David Robertson for the Rizzo Award. \nUp Next: The final game of the season series between these two teams. The Cardinals will look for their 13th win of the season over the Cubs. The next closest team, the Brewers, has nine wins against the Cubs, though the Pirates and Reds can both still enter the conversation over the final weeks of the season. \nMarcus Stroman (3-6, 3.98) will be looking to finish a tough season with a strong September. Miles Mikolas (10-10, 3.48) will oppose him for the Cardinals.",

        "description": "Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Let’s see if the rain will hold long enough for today’s double header.  The Colorado Rockies will face the Cincinnati Reds in game two of this series tonight. Let’s see if the weather holds enough to get in at least one game today. \nGermán Márquez (7-10, 4.97 ERA) will pitch for the Rockies. In his last start, he gave up only one hit in seven complete innings against the New York Mets, which was a drastic improvement from his performance against the Texas Rangers. In that start Márquez gave up six earned runs on eight hits. Hopefully he can find a way to channel whatever success he found in NY in Cincinnati today. \nNo matter the outcome, it’s exciting knowing that we get to watch Michael Toglia, Sean Bouchard and Elehuris Montero play. They are hopefully the future of this team and have a lot of talent to bring. I’ll take a rookie home run today, how about you?\nThe Reds will call on rookie Nick Lodolo (3-5, 4.30 ERA). He spent some time on the IL this season and returned in early July. Lodolo will likely be trying to strike out as many batters as he can. He has 82 strikeouts in his 67 innings pitched this season. The Rockies will need to be efficient to not be impacted by his strikeout rate. \nFirst Pitch: 10:10 a.m. MDT\nTV: AT&amp;T Sports Net Rocky Mountain (COL), Bally Sports South (ATL); MLB.TV\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM; KNRV 1150 (Spanish)\nLineups:\n\n\nShall we try this again, @reds?            pic.twitter.com/QUyI9Oa0Cx— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nStarters for game one of today's doubleheader.

        "description": "Photo by John E. Moore III/Getty Images\n    \n\n  While he isn’t the arm many were expecting would be the next to get the call, another of Arizona’s top-10 prospects will be making his MLB debut Monday night. Welcome to the Majors, Ryne Nelson.\nSome Quick Basics\nRyne Nelson is a 24-year-old right-handed starter out of the University of Oregon. He was selected by the Diamondbacks in the second round of the 2019 draft, going 56th overall. He was actually the team’s fourth overall pick that year, with Corbin Carroll being their first, followed by Brennan Malone (since traded to the Pirates) and then Drey Jameson (currently in AA Amarillo). The team’s first selection after Nelson was Tommy Henry. \nIt is September, 2022. Despite losing a season or more of development due to COVID, injuries, and other fiascos (both major and minor), the class of 2019 is making a big showing for the Snakes down the stretch. When he makes his debut on Monday, there will likely be quite the Nelson contingent in the house as Ryne Nelson hails from nearby Henderson, Nevada (yes, that Henderson). \nThe Scouting Report\nAge: 24Height: 6’3”Weight: 184B/T: R/R\nFastball 60, Curveball 50, Slider 60, Change-Up 45, Command 50, Overall 50\nWhile playing for Oregon, Nelson spent time as a two-way player, splitting his time between shortstop and being the team’s closer. During the “lost 2020”, Nelson dealt with an eye condition that wound up requiring surgery to strengthen the collagen fibers within his cornea. In addition to the surgery, he spent 2020 working diligently on cleaning up his somewhat fringy mechanics. These health and mechanical improvements transformed Nelson from a borderline starter/reliever prospect into a full-fledged starting prospect. With the adjustments made, Nelson’s wayward command was found and harnessed, going from below average to slightly above average.\nIn 2021, Nelson took a big step forward. He spent most of the season in AA Amarillo. There, he struck out over 12 batters per nine and dropped his walk rate to just 3.04. His Achille’s heel, if he had one, was that he gave up a good many home runs. However, as time has shown, Amarillo is a homer happy environment. That sort of dominance earned him a promotion to AAA Reno for 2022. \nNelson has spent the entirety of the season in Reno. His results have not been quite as dominant as they were in the lower levels, but they have been somewhat consistent, indicating it is likely time for him to move up in order to create a new set of challenges for him to develop around. He continues to keep the walks under control. Home runs are still his nemesis. His strikeout rate has dropped to 8.47/9 IP, but that is still a strong number that puts him in good company.\nNelson is almost the textbook definition of a “grip it and rip it” pitcher. He lives and dies by his plus-grade fastball which sits comfortably in the mid-90s. When he reaches back, Nelson can still reach triple digits as he did when he was closing for the Ducks. Nelson uses his fastball for an astounding 65% of his pitches. However, he doesn’t move side to side using the black. Instead, Nelson lives in the upper third of the strike zone, challenging hitters to catch up to his high velocity fastball that features excellent ride. When he is going right, Nelson expands the zone above the top and can get some very silly looking swings and misses there.\nNelson’s two breaking balls are of some interest as well. Nelson throws a slider in the mid-80s. The pitch tunnels nicely off the fastball and gets low in the zone, usually diving out of it. The pitch is good at changing the eye level of the hitter. His curveball is a mid-70s offering which he can throw for strikes in the zone with relatively good effect. \nNelson also offers a changeup which he throws in the mid-80s. While he uses the offering about the same as he does his two breaking pitches, the change clearly lags behind the others in terms of development and refinement. However, despite his lack of fine control of the pitch, it still helps to speed up his impressive fastball when he picks his spots to throw it and is able to execute.\nWhat to Expect\nIt remains to be seen just how big a cup of coffee the Diamondbacks are going to give Nelson this September. This alteration to the rotation is coming in advance of a tough stretch of games later this month, a stretch that includes five games in four days against the Dodgers in Chavez Ravine. At the very least, this call-up creates a temporary six-man rotation situation, pushing all the starters back a day, giving them some extra rest and working towards lining the staff up for that series of games. Between this move and the ability of the club to bring an extra pitcher to the double header, the club should be in a position to work their way through that stretch of games without exhausting the bullpen entirely. As for now, Nelson has been added to the taxi squad in advance of his Monday activation. No corresponding roster move has yet been announced.\nExpect Nelson to get a full start, not to be used as an opener. We can also assume he will have a modest pitch limit, likely around 95 pitches. The organization has never really been one to throw young talent out to the mound without a pitch count safety net. There is no reason to expect that to change now. While Nelson may get two or three starts, they may be curtailed somewhat, depending on how hard Nelson labours through MLB lineups. In 2021, his first full season throwing pitches as a professional, Nelson reached 116.1 IP Nelson joins the Diamondbacks having already thrown a career-high 136 innings in the pitcher-hating environment of Reno. Another 24 innings (3-5 starts) would give him a comfortable 160 IP, an ideal place to shut Nelson down to begin offseason recovery.\nIf Nelson is able to hold his own for a few turns through the expanded rotation, fans should expect him to be a front-runner for a rotation slot coming out of spring training in 2023, as one of the growing number of options to fill in slots behind Zac Gallen, Merrill, Kelly, and (unfortunately) Madison Bumgarner.",

The eighth inning of the contest has just begun and it runs through September 15. \n\nMarlins Game Notes\n\n\nMarlins Starting Lineup\n\n2B Charles Leblanc (119 wRC+ this season, 99 wRC+ over last 30 days)\nRF Brian Anderson (98, 68)\n1B Garrett Cooper (107, 29)\nDH Nick Fortes (113, 83)\nLF Jerar Encarnación (74, 76)\n3B Joey Wendle (84, 65)  \nC Jacob Stallings (66, 111)\nCF Peyton Burdick (68, 68)\nSS Miguel Rojas (69, 33)\n\nRHP Pablo López (112 ERA+ this season, career 107 ERA+) \n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n      López’s 2022 pitch distribution and Statcast percentile rankings \n  \n\nLineup Changes from Previous Game: Cooper Rojas and Stallings in, JJ Bleday, Lewin Díaz and Luke Williams out; Fortes switches from C to DH, Encarnación switches from DH to LF, Wendle switches from SS to 3B, Burdick switches from LF to CF\nAdditional Notes: This is the Marlins’ first time experimenting with Leblanc in the leadoff spot...Jon Berti (right hip soreness) has been sidelined since August 31...Rojas (.859 OPS in 22 PA) has the most head-to-head history with Max Fried among active Marlins players.\n\nBraves Starting Lineup\n\nDH Ronald Acuña Jr. (118, 137) \nSS Dansby Swanson (118, 74) \n3B Austin Riley (152, 117) \n1B Matt Olson (124, 106)\nC Travis d’Arnaud (120, 207)\nCF Michael Harris II (138, 179)\n2B Vaughn Grissom (140, 140)\nLF Marcell Ozuna (78, -20) \nRF Eddie Rosario (50, 77) \n\nLHP Max Fried (162 ERA+ this season, career 139 ERA+) \n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n      Fried’s 2022 pitch distribution and Statcast percentile rankings\n  \n\nNotes: I envy Atlanta’s lineup continuity. Everything is the same as Saturday except for d’Arnaud swapping spots with William Contreras for day-game-after-night-game duty...Fried is one of the few pitchers who has any hope of snatching the National League Cy Young award away from Sandy Alcantara. He’s been even better than Alcantara in regards to keeping balls in the yard, allowing only two home runs over his last 13 starts...Acuña (1.081 OPS in 26 PA) has the most head-to-head history with López among active Braves players.\n\nHow to Watch/Listen/Follow\nFirst pitch is scheduled for 1:35 p.m. ET.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3626081-what-the-us-can-learn-from-kenyas-fight-for-democracy/",
        "description": "Last month, we helped lead an International Election Observation Mission for Kenya’s presidential elections, sponsored by the&nbsp;International Republican Institute&nbsp;(IRI) and the&nbsp;National Democratic Institute&nbsp;(NDI), on whose boards we serve. At the time of our writing, William Ruto had narrowly edged out Raila Odinga, but court challenges to the results are still being worked out.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Kenya’s elections are once again disputed, they are being done so through legal channels and the democratic achievements of the Kenyan people are clear. The Kenyan Supreme Court is scheduled to rule on petitions challenging the presidential results tomorrow. \n\n\n\nKenya has been a relative bastion of stability in a very difficult neighborhood. Surrounded by unrest and one-man rule in&nbsp;Sudan&nbsp;and&nbsp;South Sudan, rampant terrorism in&nbsp;Somalia, civil war in&nbsp;Ethiopia&nbsp;and dictatorship in&nbsp;Uganda, Kenya’s dedication to elections and multi-party politics is an inspiration to its people, the region and the continent. It’s also an inspiration to aspiring democracies all over the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKenya’s next president faces daunting problems: a large youth population with&nbsp;limited job opportunities, a crushing&nbsp;debt burden&nbsp;(encouraged by Chinese lending to fund large infrastructure projects) and pervasive&nbsp;corruption. Kenya’s democracy is far from perfect; voter registration and turnout&nbsp;declined&nbsp;in 2022, and post-election violence in 2007 left&nbsp;over 1,000 dead&nbsp;and hundreds of thousands displaced. The last presidential election in 2017 was&nbsp;annulled&nbsp;by the Supreme Court and had to be redone. Yet, despite these very real challenges, Kenyans voted and relished the opportunity to have a voice in their future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInternational observation serves to reinforce global support for credible elections around the world. Reflecting that elections are a process, prior to our deployment, NDI and IRI conducted missions to Kenya in May and July to assess the electoral context and preparations for elections. On the eve of the elections, we met with a wide array of stakeholders, including leading presidential candidates, members of the Independent Election Commission and the Supreme Court, civic society representatives, church groups, women’s organizations and independent citizen observers who were conducting a parallel vote tabulation. \n\n\n\nOn Election Day this Aug. 9, we observed an impressive logistical undertaking with over 46,000 polling places across a country slightly larger than California and Florida combined. We witnessed staffers working through the night before the election to ensure polling places would open on time. We saw long lines in Kibera, the section of the capital of Nairobi that is&nbsp;Africa’s largest slum, and all across the region. Still, voters patiently waited to have their identification verified before receiving their ballots and voting.\n\n\n\nKenya’s election had both 21st-century cutting-edge biometric real-time voter identification, and old-style manual counting where ballots were dumped on makeshift tables for tabulation (manual hand counting) well into the night.\n\n\n\nWe witnessed firsthand women voting, as well as women candidates competing for high offices like the vice president and governors of their respective regions or constituencies. While women candidates faced harassment and threats of physical violence, Kenya elected a historic number of female governors  in addition to voting women into 26 Parliamentary seats and three Senate seats. Still, while close to half of voters are women, Kenya's government has never held many women. The country is far from achieving the “two-thirds gender principle” enacted in order to increase women's representation in government.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRuto campaigned on a classic “rags to riches story” —  roadside chicken seller risen to wealthy businessman and current deputy president. His slogan, “Every Hustle Matters,” was designed to appeal to young Kenyans who rely on the vast underground economy. Odinga was a known commodity for Kenyan voters, having served as prime minister and previously run for president four times. Repeatedly jailed without trial under the Moi dictatorship in the 1980s, Odinga was endorsed by current President Kenyatta over Kenyatta’s previous running mate and serving Deputy President Ruto — a House of Cards-like twist of the type that dominates Kenyan politics.   \n\n\n\nWhy does far away Kenya matter for the U.S. with so many of our own challenges? It is the economic powerhouse of East Africa, anchoring the western Indian Ocean where China increasingly flexes its muscle and expands its military footprint. It was in Kenya (and neighboring Tanzania) where Osama bin Laden&nbsp;attacked&nbsp;the U.S., bombing our embassies in 1998, and killing 213 people in Nairobi (and 11 in Dar es Salaam). Kenya has been a loyal partner in countering Islamic extremism, serving as a diplomatic mediator in regional conflicts, and providing safe haven for refugees fleeing turmoil, including the horrific 1994 genocide in&nbsp;Rwanda&nbsp;and the tragic ongoing conflict in the&nbsp;Democratic Republic of Congo. Kenya was also one of the most&nbsp;vocal critics&nbsp;of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As one of the most important countries in the dynamic African continent, Kenya’s political direction and democratic stability are matters of great concern all over the globe.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs we repeatedly told our Kenyan interlocutors, elections are about more than just winning — they are also about accepting defeat. We know this all too well from personal experience. Losing elections with grace a dignity after the votes are counted and legitimate court challenges exhausted is every bit as important as a level campaign playing field, secret voting and transparent vote counting.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhatever the final outcome, the real winners in Kenya’s election are the voters who had a voice in choosing their leader. And the long-term winners are the citizens of every democracy on earth struggling to implement and maintain this most precious and most delicate of governing systems. That includes the United States.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDonna&nbsp;Brazile&nbsp;is a member of the board of the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. Randy Scheunemann is vice chair of the board at the International Republican Institute (IRI) and strategic counselor at the Halifax International Security Forum. The views expressed are their own.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), who serves as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, on Sunday said Democratic candidates are ready to campaign with President Biden ahead of the November midterm elections after notching several legislative victories on their belts this summer.\n\n\n\n\"You better believe we're gonna stand with the president and say we passed in a bipartisan way better roads, better bridges, better healthcare for our veterans,\" the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman told \"Fox News Sunday\" anchor Mike Emanuel.\n\n\n\n\"That's the kind of agenda that we're standing in support of, and you see it working in the polls,\" he added.\n\n\n\nDemocrats appear to be embracing Biden following a year of approval ratings that have hovered below 40 percent coupled with sky-rocketing inflation. Democrats have been celebrating the passing of a climate, tax and healthcare bill last month, a healthcare bill for veterans exposed to toxins and legislation to boost the semiconductor chip industry to make Americans more competitive in a crucial economic sector.\n\n\n\nDemocrats are optimistic about two months out from the midterm elections, which will decide which party controls Congress.\n\n\n\nLast month, a special election for a House seat in New York and a House race in Alaska both saw Democrats come out on top against their GOP opponents in bellwether tests for November.\n\n\n\nWhile Republicans were forecast to retake the House earlier this year amid a 40-year high inflation rate, the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of abortion rights in June is largely thought to have shifted the momentum back to Democrats.\n\n\n\nMaloney on Sunday said Democrats have also been successful under Biden's watch, lowering prescription drug costs through the Inflation Reduction Act and imposing a minimum tax on large corporations and passing a historic investment in climate change through the key legislation.\n\n\n\nThe top Democratic lawmaker said celebrations were in order for the party.\n\n\n\n\"You better believe Democrats are going to celebrate that,\" he said. \"So are the voters, and that's why we've we've been winning in special elections from Alaska to New York.\"",

In recent years, talk of Ollie and Peter and Richard’s hell-raising has usually been countered with a frowning diagnosis of alcoholism, and this film simply quotes Harris’s own roistering dismissal of all that: (“I drank because I loved it!”) and pretty much leaves things there.

        "description": "Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) on Sunday defended GOP candidates who appear to have distanced themselves from former President Trump and their stance on abortion, saying he trusts them to know their districts and voters.\n\n\n\nEmmer, the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), on \"Fox News Sunday\" instead turned the table on Democrats, alleging the party that was trotting an \"extreme\" agenda on abortion.\n\n\n\n\"Good luck to them trying to defend their extreme position,\" Emmer said. \"I think our candidates know how to message that and there'll be just fine in the midterms.\"\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post last week reported that nine GOP candidates have scrubbed or changed their stances online regarding former President Trump or abortion. \n\n\n\nIn one example, Arizona GOP Senate candidate Blake Masters, who once described himself as “100% pro-life\" with hardline anti-abortion stances, changed his website to attack his Democratic opponent and argue instead he does not support third trimester abortions.\n\n\n\nThe changes come after Republicans had two major defeats to Democrats in bellwether tests in New York and Alaska last month.\n\n\n\nDemocrats appear to be seeing ground shift their way after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the nearly 50-year constitutional right to abortion and the FBI search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in which the former president is under investigation for his handling of classified documents.\n\n\n\nEmmer on Sunday disagreed Republicans were losing ground over abortion, telling anchor Mike Emmanuel the NRCC trusts candidates \"to know their districts and know how they're going to appeal to their voters.\"\n\n\n\nThe GOP campaign chief said Trump was a \"fantastic ally\" and Republicans were in a good position to win the midterm elections and retake the House come November largely due to the direction of the economy.\n\n\n\n\"Money talks and money is painting a pessimistic future for Democrats,\" he said.",

Trump demonstrated exceptional political clout in the Republican primaries, with scores of candidates succeeding because they had the endorsement of the former president.\n\n\n\nThe general election will indicate whether that clout extends beyond the hard core. I've picked a dozen races that'll test that.\n\n\n\nThe commonalities these “dirty dozen” share: They are in competitive contests in a year that should tilt Republican, were chosen over the preferences of establishment officials, are all election deniers (reiterating the Big Lie that the 2020 election — where Joe Biden won by 7 million votes — was fraudulent) and are embracing what were once considered fringe views.\n\n\n\nRunning for Senate\n\n\n\nJ.D. Vance, author of the best-selling memoir, “Hillybilly Elegy,” leapt to the top of the Ohio GOP primary after Trump's endorsement. Once a harsh Trump critic, Vance has done a full 180. He charges the Biden administration's support for Ukraine grows out of its opposition to Vladimir Putin, who “doesn't believe in transgender rights.”\n\n\n\nHerschel Walker, a former football star, had a professional sports relationship with Trump. Walker hadn't lived in Georgia in decades, but cleared the field when Trump embraced him. Not conversant with issues, Walker explained the fallacy of the Democrats' climate change initiatives, saying “Our good air decided to float over to China's bad air. So when China gets our good air their bad air got to move. So it moves over to our good air space.”\n\n\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz, the TV doctor who peddled dubious medicinal cures, won the Pennsylvania Senate nomination — over hedge funds executive David McCormick — with Trump's surprise endorsement. A New Jersey resident who moved to Pennsylvania earlier this year, Oz, in a social media video, said he was shopping at “Wegner's.” There is no such store in Pennsylvania; he explained that sometimes he gets his children's names wrong.\n\n\n\nA fourth first-time candidate backed by Trump is Blake Masters, a protege of venture capitalist Peter Thiel running for John McCain’s old Senate seat in Arizona. He disassociates from the late GOP icon, declaring, “It’s not his Republican Party in Arizona anymore.” Masters has called for privatizing Social Security and a total abortion ban with no exceptions; for the general election, he slightly modified his stances.\n\n\n\nTed Budd was an obscure North Carolina congressman until Trump's endorsement; then, he blew past former Gov. Pat McCrory. A gun store owner, Budd voted against the modest gun control bill that was supported by the state's two GOP Senators. Budd has said the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol really “was nothing. It was just patriots standing up.”\n\n\n\nRaces for governor\n\n\n\nIn Maryland, Trumpite Dan Cox trounced the candidate supported by the state's popular outgoing GOP Gov. Larry Hogan. Cox attended the Jan. 6 Capitol rally; when Vice President Mike Pence refused to alter the electoral college count, Cox tweeted, “Mike Pence is a traitor.”\n\n\n\nKari Lake, a longtime Phoenix TV anchor and once an Obama voter, went full MAGA and beat the establishment candidate supported by the governor and Mike Pence. She is a favorite of the radical right, appearing with people linked to the Q-Anon conspiracy and thanking a Nazi sympathizer for support.\n\n\n\nTim Michels, with Trump's backing, defeated the once-favored former Wisconsin lieutenant governor, even though he has only lived in the state part-time. Michels, a businessman, said he might decertify the state's 2020 election results — Biden won Wisconsin by more than 20,000 votes — even though that's constitutionally impermissible.\n\n\n\nDoug Mastriano, to the shock of Pennsylvania's GOP establishment, easily won the nomination. The former Army officer attended the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, but didn’t enter the building apparently. He campaigns as a Christian nationalist and espouses right-wing conspiracy theories.\n\n\n\nThe House\n\n\n\nDonald Trump's obsession to drive out of office the ten Republicans who voted to impeach him — at best only two will return — boosted decorated veteran Joe Kent, who defeated Jaime Herrera Beutler in Washington State. Although Nathan Gonzales’s “Inside Politics” rates this a “solidly Republican” seat, Kent's hard right views and associations with white nationalists and the Proud Boys, a violence-prone hate group, could put it in play.\n\n\n\nIn Michigan, John Gibbs — with Trump's backing — defeated another Republican who voted for impeachment. Gibbs has promoted crazy fringe conspiracies, like claiming that Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign engaged in satanic rituals.\n\n\n\nBo Hines, a former college football player fueled by Trump's backing, scored an upset in a primary for an open North Carolina seat.&nbsp;The 27-year-old newcomer has called for defunding the FBI and for a federal ban on abortion with no exceptions.\n\n\n\nWhatever happens to the runner-up in the last presidential election, Trumpism will remain the dominant force in the Republican party. If at least nine or ten of these candidates win in November, it will only tighten his hold.\n\n\n\nIf, however, most of the dirty dozen lose in what is supposed to be good GOP year, it will cause consternation and maybe even some rethinking in the party ranks.\n\n\n\nAl Hunt is the former executive editor of Bloomberg News.

        "description": "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) on Sunday said he will back President Biden in a 2024 reelection bid, the latest Democrat to announce support for the president.\n\n\n\n\"He'll have no bigger backer than yours truly,\" Murphy told \"Fox News Sunday\" host Mike Emanuel.\n\n\n\nBiden, who earlier this year faced calls from some within his party to not seek another White House term, is now enjoying more support for reelection from Democrats amid improved job approval ratings.\n\n\n\nPolling last week revealed about 40 percent of Americans approve of Biden, a significant jump that comes after Democrats passed the climate, tax and health care bill and other key legislation.\n\n\n\nBiden holds a 6-point lead over former President Trump, 50 to 44 percent, in a hypothetical matchup, according to one recent poll, and would defeat the GOP leader if the election were held today.\n\n\n\nMurphy said on Sunday Biden's recent announcement to cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt for some borrowers was another huge victory for the party.\n\n\n\n\"The American dream is alive and well in New Jersey,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"I think the president has had a heck of a run here. I saw him the other day and told him that,\" he added. \"Whether it's Congress getting stuff passed that he had signed, his own leadership or sadly, for the wrong reasons of what the Supreme Court did with reproductive freedoms, there's no question about it. The Democrats have momentum.\"\n\n\n\n--Updated at 11:28 a.m.",

        "description": "Kevin Sousa-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Rays have overcome a lot to surge back into the AL East race with the Yankees. The Tampa Bay Rays entered this weekend series against the New York Yankees with a chance to cut down the AL East lead to a mere three games. That they’d even have a shot at this point in the year would have seemed ridiculous as recently as a couple months ago.\nThe Yankees are still favorites to win the AL East, but the simple fact this discussion must be had, and that there is the very real possibility of the Rays somehow overtaking them, well, it represents a rather colossal failure for this Yankees squad in the second half of the year. There was a time not that long ago when real discussions were had about the ceiling of this team, in terms of number of wins, and if it could challenge the Mariners for the most in a single regular season. That all seems like ages ago at this point, and most fans would settle for some consistency, especially on the offensive side.\nThe Yankees have certainly had a lot go wrong for them this summer. But adversity is a part of each season for all 30 teams, and it comes in different levels and at different times for every team over the course of a 162-game season. There are slumps, injuries, bad breaks, and a whole bunch of stuff that can create losing streaks and the like.\nA ball club that’s had three separate runs losing eight of ten, six of eight, and most recently five of six in the last 30 days or so will have any number of things to point to and blame. But when we compare to the team chasing the Yankees, it’s clear none of it is enough to excuse the horrific play on the field.\nSure, we can talk about the loss of Matt Carpenter, who was hitting like peak Babe Ruth over 154 at-bats in 2022. There’s DJ LeMahieu’s lingering toe problem that’s affecting his ability to hit for power. There’s Giancarlo Stanton’s prolonged absence from the lineup alongside the injuries to Nestor Cortes and Luis Severino, to name a few.\nAll of those factors matter significantly, but winning teams, those clubs that want to make the World Series and win it, must overcome these adversities and remain competitive even through the most difficult parts of the season. The Yankees have dealt with setbacks through this last month-plus, but they pale in comparison with what their biggest adversary, the reigning back-to-back AL East champion Tampa Bay Rays, has had to deal with across the 2022 campaign as a whole.\nThe Rays' biggest star, Wander Franco, has been out since well before the All-Star Break, and in the limited time he had this season, Franco was having a rather subpar year with a mediocre .260/.308/.396 slash line, that was surely bound to creep up had he stayed healthy. Insert a full season of Franco at his normal level and no other changes, and the Rays might be a couple of games back, instead of five at time of writing.\nA couple of complementary pieces that were coming off strong 2021 seasons in Mike Zunino and veteran leader Kevin Kiermaier were both underperforming and are currently on the 60-day IL. On the pitching side of things, the Rays already began the year without their at-the-time ace, Tyler Glasnow, who’s still recovering from Tommy John surgery. The best pitching prospect in baseball, Shane Baz, also started the year on the shelf, having gone through surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow, and he looked poised to become one of the premier starters in the American League before going down for the year following only six starts. Talented young starter Luis Patiño also missed significant time.\nThe Yankees can fairly point to a number tough breaks, but their biggest names in Aaron Judge and Gerrit Cole have remained healthy through the whole season. The Rays have had no such luck, and still find themselves within five games of the division ahead of Saturday’s game, and in a prime spot for a Wild Card berth.\nThis is truly a disappointing second half, beyond what even the most pessimistic prognosticators could’ve expected. There’s still time to right the ship and get healthy for October. But the Yankees’ rivals have shown that even if they don’t ever get back to full health, there’s no excuse for the Yankees’ collaps.",

I never doubted her sincerity, and it was a really good thing to do because it reminded me at a conscious and subconscious level that there was trust between us. It's a given. If you can't trust your doctor, you need to get a new doctor. So I've started to do that in my own mind as I narrate projects to myself. Okay that's done my friend. Let's figure out what's next friend. My friend this is a hard problem. I just add the punctuation to remind myself that I trust myself, I'm doing something I'm good at, and know it. It really does manage the mood of my subconscious, it's reassuring. I got this, really means we got this.",

        "description": "Here is a thought experiment: Suppose Mikhail Gorbachev, the USSR’s only president, had been president of the United States instead? Elevated to the Politburo in 1979 because of the rapid turnover and deaths of three geriatric general-secretaries (i.e. leaders of the USSR), Gorbachev was unanimously elected general-secretary in 1985 at age 54.\n\n\n\nBecause Gorbachev was given various responsibilities during those six years in the Politburo, he recognized that the political-economic condition of the Soviet Union was in extremis and could not be sustained indefinitely without fundamental reform. That became his goal. And he understood the resistance that reform faced but also that he had no alternative.\n\n\n\nA confirmed Marxist-Leninist, Gorbachev set about fixing the USSR’s irrational political system with&nbsp;perestroika(restructuring) and&nbsp;glasnost&nbsp;(openness) with every intent of keeping the Soviet Union whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;He spectacularly failed, and the Soviet Union imploded.&nbsp;But the Cold War ended peacefully.\n\n\n\nSuppose Gorbachev had been born in the U.S. to poor parents who were contract farm laborers.&nbsp;Winning a scholarship,&nbsp;young Mikey Gorbachev graduated from one of America’s most prestigious universities and then from an equally prestigious law school.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clerking for a Supreme Court associate justice, Gorbachev’s first job was working for a well-known Washington, D.C., law firm.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRealizing that public service was his calling, Gorbachev returned to his hometown, and at age 30 was elected mayor. Attracting attention, Gorbachev was recruited by the state Republican Party to run for mayor of the state’s largest city.&nbsp;Gorbachev was a reformer and innovator.&nbsp;After two terms, Gorbachev won the governorship and later became head of the National Governors Association.\n\n\n\nUnder his leadership, and despite the economic distress that affected most of America, Gorbachev’s state became one of the most prosperous and innovative. His government&nbsp;provided excellent and responsive service to its residents.&nbsp;Nominated as vice president, Gorbachev’s running mate was elected president.\n\n\n\nAs vice president, Gorbachev was given a wide portfolio across government, both domestically and internationally.&nbsp;The elderly president suffered from ill health, adding further responsibilities to the vice president. Gorbachev became increasingly concerned by what he found was a government that clearly was not working for Americans.\n\n\n\nWherever Gorbachev looked, government agencies were failing.&nbsp;The list was almost as endless as the size of the government.&nbsp;And foreign policy was in poor shape.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nChina, Russia, Iran and North Korea were clear-cut enemies.&nbsp;Relations had not been as bad since the Cold War.&nbsp;Tensions over Taiwan and Ukraine raised fears of war and escalation.&nbsp;What could a vice president do?\n\n\n\nThen, the president suddenly died, and Gorbachev became president.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gorbachev understood that about 75 percent of Americans believed the nation was headed in the wrong direction and that government was not working. Over half believed that a civil war was looming.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd, with a divided Congress, Gorbachev knew that many of the programs and reforms that were needed would never gain sufficient votes to pass or were doomed by the filibuster.&nbsp;Yet, Gorbachev, despite not having been elected president, was determined to fix America.\n\n\n\nGorbachev called for a two-pronged approach.&nbsp;First, he was going to restructure the executive branch that was organized not much differently from George Washington’s original Cabinet.&nbsp;Education was to become the Department of Learning and Information; Commerce changed to Science, Industry and Technology; Agriculture was dissolved because the number of independent farmers was statistically insignificant; Transportation expanded to Infrastructure; Energy and Interior combined to form Energy and Environment; Homeland Security disbanded and its functions were assigned to the Departments of State, Defense and Justice; Housing and Urban Development was downgraded to an agency.\n\n\n\nTo bring the nation together, Gorbachev proposed putting in place national referenda on key issues to determine what Americans favored and did not.&nbsp;And he moved to universal voting, meaning that all Americans qualified and able had to appear at polling places on Election Day regardless of whether they voted.\n\n\n\nFinally, he challenged Congress to reorganize, reducing its vast number of overlapping committees and subcommittees. And he proposed that before voting on any bill, all members would swear or affirm that each had read and understood the pending legislation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is what it might take to fix America. But would an American Gorbachev have succeeded?\n\n\n\nHarlan&nbsp;Ullman&nbsp;is senior adviser at the Atlantic Council and the prime author of “shock and awe.”&nbsp;His latest&nbsp;&nbsp;book is&nbsp;“The Fifth Horseman and the New MAD: How Massive Attacks of Disruption Became the Looming Existential Danger to a Divided Nation and the World at Large.”&nbsp;Follow him on Twitter @harlankullman.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/mets-notes-carrasco-medina-scherzer.html",
        "description": "The Mets will welcome Carlos Carrasco back from the 15-day injured list today, with the veteran righty being activated to start against the Nationals.  Right-hander Adonis Medina was optioned to Triple-A to open up a spot for Carrasco on the active roster.\nCarrasco hasn&#8217;t pitched since August 15 due to a left oblique strain, though fortunately for both the right-hander and the Mets, it was a lower-grade oblique issue.  Rather than a season-threatening injury, Carrasco is now back after just shy of three weeks on the sidelines, and ready to help the Mets in their bid for the NL East title.  Though the injury wasn&#8217;t overly serious, it did have some notable ramifications on Carrasco&#8217;s contract, as he now won&#8217;t be able to reach the 170 innings necessary to turn the Mets&#8217; $14MM club option for 2023 into a guaranteed year.\nHowever, it is also quite possible the Mets will end up exercising that option anyway, given how solid Carrasco has been this year.  After his first season in New York was marred by injuries, Carrasco has rebounded to post a 3.92 ERA/3.60 SIERA over 126 1/3 innings in 2022.  While his hard-contact numbers are middling and Carrasco has been hampered by a .330 BABIP, he has posted above-average strikeout and walk rates.  As has often been the case throughout his career, Carrasco also still has one of the best chase rates of any pitcher in baseball.\nThe Mets have an 85-49 record despite playing virtually the entire season without their first-choice rotation, and that trend might be in danger of continuing just as Carrasco makes his return.  Max Scherzer had to leave yesterday&#8217;s start after 67 pitches due to what the team described as left side fatigue.\nConsidering that Scherzer missed close to two months with a oblique strain of his own earlier this season, his removal &#8220;was a precautionary move,&#8221; the right-hander told MLB.com&#8217;s Joe Trezza and other reporters.\n&#8220;There was nothing that happened.  Nothing tightened up.  Just had general fatigue overall on my left side,&#8221; Scherzer said.  &#8220;That is where you can run into an injury, when you&#8217;re pitching through fatigue&#8230;.I just couldn&#8217;t take any risks, especially where the calendar is at.  There is no time left to re-ramp back up.  I think that played just as important a factor in coming out after five [innings].&#8221;\nScherzer said he would be able to make his next start, while Mets manager Buck Showalter was a little less steadfast, instead saying &#8220;we’re hopeful [Scherzer] can make his next start.&#8221;  New York doesn&#8217;t have a game on Thursday, so Scherzer will already get an extra day to rest and recover before he is slated to face the Marlins on September 9.  Given the right-hander&#8217;s importance to the Mets&#8217; playoff chances, it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to see that start pushed back or perhaps even scratched if Scherzer has any at all lingering effects from his side issue.",

        "description": "Photo by Scott Kane/Getty Images\n    \n\n  One last time vs. St. Louis for 2022. Sunday notes...\n\n\nNOT HOLDING THE LEAD: The Cubs have had the lead at some point in six of the eight games on this road trip, failing to take a lead only in the two games in which they were shut out. They managed to win only two of those six games.\n\nAND THAT HASN’T HELPED ALL YEAR: The Cubs have scored first in 78 of their 133 games this year, but have gone just 40-38 in those contests. The 78 games scoring first are third-most in the majors behind the Mets and Astros (81 each). The 38 defeats in those games are most in the majors (The Reds are second with 28 losses in games when scoring first).\n\nALSO: The Cubs are second in the majors with 74 games decided by two or fewer runs this season (Pirates, 75). The team’s 33-41 record (.446) in games decided by two or fewer runs is tied for seventh-worst in the majors.\n\nEVEN SO: The Cubs are 21-20 since the All-Star break. By comparison, the AL East-leading Yankees are 15-26 since the break.\n\nTHE FRANIMAL: Franmil Reyes, last six games: .304/.385/.609 (7-for-23), a double, two home runs, three walks, five runs scored.\n\nHere are today’s particulars.\nCubs lineup:\n\n\nHere is today's #Cubs starting lineup. pic.twitter.com/JL7f4lFVoL— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nCardinals lineup: \n\n\nThe last Cardinals vs. Cubs game of 2022! pic.twitter.com/aNVfwQdVJC— St. Louis Cardinals (@Cardinals) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nMarcus Stroman, RHP vs. Miles Mikolas, RHP\n  \n        \n      USA TODAY NETWORK\n  \n\n  \n        \n      USA TODAY NETWORK\n  \n\nOnce again, I feel compelled to point out this 2022 split:\nMarcus Stroman, road games: 11 starts, 2.05 ERA, 1.027 WHIP, 8 HR in 40⅓ inningsMarcus Stroman, home games: 8 starts, 6.92 ERA, 1.488 WHIP, 4 HR in 61⅓ innings\nMaybe it’s random, maybe it’s not, but by starting Stroman on regular rest today, the Cubs avoid pushing him back to a home start Tuesday. They could, with careful selection, have him start only once more at home this year. Ten of his 11 road starts can be categorized as “good to excellent,” while only two of his eight home starts fall in that category.\nOne of the good road starts came in the first game of a doubleheader August 4 in St. Louis, where Stroman threw six two-hit innings before running out of gas in the seventh and allowing a pair of home runs.\nHere’s to one of those good outings being this afternoon.\nMiles Mikolas has made four starts against the Cubs this year and posted a 4.13 ERA and 1.333 WHIP. The most recent of those starts was August 24 at Wrigley Field, where the Cubs scored five runs (three earned) off Mikolas in 6x innings. Included in that was a home run by Zach McKinstry. Mikolas followed that by getting knocked out in the fifth inning August 29 against the Reds, and since July 24 has posted a 5.81 ERA in seven starts and allowed eight home runs in 48 innings.\nHopefully the Cubs can hit him this afternoon.\n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \nToday’s game is on Marquee Sports Network. Here’s a list of providers currently carrying Marquee. \nHere is the complete MLB.com Mediacenter for today.\nMLB.com Gameday\nBaseball-reference.com game preview\nPlease visit our SB Nation Cardinals site Viva el Birdos. If you do go there to interact with Cardinals fans, please be respectful, abide by their individual site rules and serve as a good representation of Cub fans in general and BCB in particular.\nThe 2022 Game Thread procedure will be like last years, similar to what we’ve used for Spring Training.\nYou’ll find the game preview posted separately on the front page two hours before game time (90 minutes for some early day games following night games).\nAt the same time, a StoryStream containing the preview will also post on the front page, titled “Cubs vs. (Team) (Day of week/date) game threads.” It will contain every post related to that particular game, including the First Pitch Thread and the overflow thread, as well as the recap when it’s published. The recap will also live on the front page as a separate post.\nYou will also be able to find the preview, First Pitch Thread and the overflow thread in the box marked “Chicago Cubs Game Threads” at the bottom of the front page (you can also find them in this section link). The StoryStream for each game can also be found in that section.\nThe First Pitch thread will post at five minutes before game time, then an overflow thread at 90 minutes after the scheduled game time.\nDiscuss amongst yourselves.",

        "description": "White House senior adviser Keisha Lance Bottoms on Sunday said the \"hate-filled\" MAGA agenda \"has no place in a democracy,\" echoing President Biden's primetime address last week in which he labeled the political movement a threat to the U.S.\n\n\n\nBottoms told ABC's \"This Week\" host Martha Raddatz that Biden called out former President Trump and his fierce supporters to highlight the dangers they pose.\n\n\n\n\"This MAGA Republican agenda, this hate-filled agenda ... that we saw incite violence on our nation’s Capitol has no place in a democracy,\" Bottoms said. \"And if we are not intentional about calling it out, which is what the president did, then our country, everything that our country is built upon, is in danger.\"\n\n\n\nBiden last Thursday appeared to divide the GOP into two camps: mainstream Republicans and the former president's MAGA supporters, a movement that he has previously compared to \"semi-fascism.\"\n\n\n\nRepublicans have largely decried the speech, calling Biden a \"divider-in-chief\" and the address a political ploy while Trump slammed Biden as an \"enemy of the state.\"\n\n\n\nAround 70 million Americans voted for Trump in the 2020 election, raising concerns that Biden, who campaigned on unity, is further dividing and polarizing the nation with his rhetoric against Trump and a prominent GOP wing.\n\n\n\nWhen posed this question by Raddatz, Bottoms noted that the president has worked with mainstream Republicans to pass a bipartisan bill on gun control over the summer and will continue to do so.\n\n\n\n\"What the president has said is that mainstream Republicans, independents, Democrats can all come together,\" she said. \"We’ve seen us come together to do what’s right on behalf of the American people.\"\n\n\n\nWhile some in the Republican Party have pushed back against Trump — notably Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and nine other House Republicans who voted to impeach him for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol — the former president has retained a strong grip on the GOP.\n\n\n\nThe political leader has demonstrated his lasting strength in the GOP by pushing to unseat Republican opponents. All but two of the House Republicans who voted to impeach him have announced retirement or fallen in a primary against Trump-backed opponents, including Cheney.\n\n\n\nTrump continues to push the false conspiracy theory the 2020 election was stolen and said as recently as last week that he might pardon Jan. 6 defendants who stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop certification of the 2020 election.\n\n\n\nBottoms on Sunday told Raddatz the MAGA agenda has \"been about distorting the truth\" and \"misleading people.\"\n\n\n\n\"What the president has done as our commander in chief is he’s reminded us that democracies are fragile,\" she said. \"And if we are not intentional about preserving who we are as a country, if we are not intentional about reminding ourselves that there is a rule of law in this country, then we will be in danger.\"\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration has also brushed off criticism for stationing Marines behind the president during an address in which he called political opponents extremists.\n\n\n\nBut Bottoms said the \"president spoke optimistically about who we are as Americans.\"\n\n\n\n\"We are the greatest nation in the world,\" the senior White House adviser said Sunday, saying the speech is a \"reminder that we have to be intentional about being the greatest nation in the world and that we have to call out hatred.\"",

        "description": "Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said on Sunday that President Biden was “right to sound the alarm” about former President Trump and the MAGA wing of the Republican Party.\n\n\n\n“Two of the hallmarks of a fascist political party are, one, they don't accept the results of elections that don't go their way. And two, they embrace political violence,” Raskin told moderator Major Garrett on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \n\n\n\n“And I think that's why President Biden was right to sound the alarm ... about these continuing attacks on our constitutional order from the outside by Donald Trump and his movement.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRaskin, a member of the House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection, also said that Trump's suggestion that the 2020 election be \"rerun\" is \"totally outside of the Constitution,\" adding that more than 60 courts have rejected Trump’s claims of election fraud. \n\n\n\nHis remarks came after Garrett noted that Trump last week \"said the 2020 election should be rerun, or he should be reinstated in office, and that if reelected in 2024, he would provide apologies and full pardons to those charged and or convicted for storming the Capitol on January 6.\"\n\n\n\nDuring a primetime address last Thursday, Biden referred to Trump and the MAGA-wing of the GOP as threats to democracy.\n\n\n\n“Not every Republican, not even a majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology,” he said. “But there’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.” \n\n\n\nHis remarks sparked pushback from a slew of GOP lawmakers.\n\n\n\n“With all due respect Mr. resident, there’s nothing wrong with America’s soul,” Sen. Lindsey Graham wrote in a tweet. “The American people are hurting because of your policies. Rampant inflation. Out of control crime. Terrorism on the rise. Broken borders. Stop lecturing &amp; change your policies before it’s too late.”\n\n\n\nIn response, White House officials rejected characterizations of the speech as political, saying defending democracy isn’t a partisan issue.",

        "description": "For most of his life, Donald Trump has wielded an immense superpower: the ability to bend and twist reality to meet his needs of the moment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut now it seems he’s losing that magic touch, especially with a group of allies that has been with him since the very beginning — the media. \n\n\n\nIn the last couple of weeks, Trump has scrambled to shift the narrative around the document stash uncovered at his Mar-a-Lago residence. But nothing seems to stick. And that’s very foreign territory for a Manhattan real estate developer who has, over the decades, displayed an uncanny ability to use the media to mold public perception.  \n\n\n\nAs far back as the 1970s, Trump reportedly placed stories in the New York press by pretending to be a hot-shot publicist named “John Miller” or “John Barron.” That character regularly sold tabloid gossip columnists and city desk reporters on the latest Trump triumph, real or imagined.  \n\n\n\nRupert Murdoch’s New York Post became a particularly ardent patron, consistently splashing Trump’s boasts in enormous typeface on its front page, including Trump insisting the NFL offered him a franchise, Trump declaring he was buying the New York Daily News, Trump planning to build a new stock exchange complex with the world’s tallest building and, most famously, then-girlfriend Marla Maples’s supposed claim that Trump was “the best sex I ever had.” (On the very next day’s Post front page, Maples denied ever saying that.) \n\n\n\nPress attention quickly spilled into television. He was interviewed by Tom Brokaw on the \"Today\" show and was a guest on David Letterman’s late-night program more than 30 times. There, Trump presented himself as a relatable billionaire who could speak expertly on any topic, from his own complicated love life to the economy and national politics. Starting in the 1980s, Letterman would regularly ask Trump about possible plans to run for president. \n\n\n\nIt’s uncertain whether journalists and interviewers actually believed any of Trump’s claims. But this much does seem clear: No one appeared to care all that much. Trump was great copy and good for ratings.  \n\n\n\nThen in 2004, Trump hit the jackpot: NBC’s reality show&nbsp;“The Apprentice.”&nbsp;It was a perfect marriage between two forces determined to shape real life into something else entirely.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nReality producers deal with many things, but genuine reality is not often one of them. Every episode is planned and structured in detail; villains and heroes are carefully selected in the casting process. Into this world stepped Trump, whose outsize reputation was often a similarly well-orchestrated, made-for-television creation.  \n\n\n\n“The Apprentice” became an instant hit for NBC — and, once again, Trump was ratings gold. But what he got in return was perhaps worth even more:&nbsp;The show was the culmination of Trump’s decades-long media manipulation. For millions of people, “The Apprentice” established as rock-solid truth his carefully constructed larger-than-life image.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat carried over into the 2016 presidential campaign and throughout his years in the White House. Rallies replaced his reality show as viewer magnets; his every word on social media was consumed by millions. As always, Trump was a good business to be in.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat long trend line may be shifting.\n\n\n\nSignificant cracks first began to appear during the Jan. 6 hearings. The former president worked hard to shape that story, but, as the hearings raced forward with a narrative velocity unheard of in Washington, allies began to face actual reality — and pull away.  \n\n\n\nEditorials in Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal and New York Post decried Trump’s actions on Jan. 6, 2021. The Post, whose love affair with the billionaire traces back a couple of generations, was unsparingly direct: “As a matter of principle, as a matter of character, Mr. Trump has proven himself unworthy to be this country’s chief executive again.” \n\n\n\nThe FBI’s search of Trump’s Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago, at first brought many supporters back into Trump’s fold. Yet, as details leaked out, some conservative media began to hedge their bets. Prime-time hosts on Fox News went all-in for Trump, but Fox’s Steve Doocy wondered on the air exactly why Trump needed all that “secret stuff” in his home. Editorials in the New York Post and The Wall Street Journal demanded greater transparency from Attorney General Merrick Garland but also admitted that Trump “brings much of his trouble on himself.”  \n\n\n\nSuggestions in court filings this past week of possible obstruction by Trump or his Florida functionaries make it even less likely that the ex-president will be able to recover his superpower and cement control over the story.  \n\n\n\nStill, it’s always hard to count Trump out. Obviously, things could still break his way; any slip-up by Garland and the FBI, big or small, could rapidly shift the plot in Trump’s direction. But there’s no question that — for now — the former media darling finds himself on unfamiliar terrain: He’s still a great story. It’s just not the story he wants to tell.\n\n\n\nJoe Ferullo is an award-winning media executive, producer and journalist and former executive vice president of programming for CBS Television Distribution.

        "description": "In his first start back from the injured list, Tyler Mahle lasted only two innings before leaving last night&#8217;s game due to inflammation in his right shoulder.  As a result, Mahle has been returned to the 15-day IL, with left-hander Jovani Moran recalled from Triple-A.  Moran was only optioned to Triple-A yesterday as the corresponding move for Mahle&#8217;s activation.\nShoulder inflammation was responsible for Mahle&#8217;s previous IL stint, and he also missed three weeks in July due to a right shoulder strain.  Since July 3, Mahle has appeared in only six games and tossed 28 1/3 innings, with his last four starts coming with Minnesota after being acquired by the Reds at the trade deadline.\nThe Twins hoped that Mahle would be a big boost to the rotation down the stretch, and he did at least contribute a 2.51 ERA over his first three outings in a Minnesota uniform (with the Twins winning all three of those games).  However, given the recurring nature of his shoulder problems, it is fair to wonder if Mahle&#8217;s season could be in jeopardy.\nTwins manager Rocco Baldelli told reporters (including MLB.com&#8217;s Do-Hyoung Park) yesterday that Mahle was slated to undergo more examinations today, and implied that another IL stint was forthcoming, &#8220;What that means going forward?  No one knows the answer to that yet.  I&#8217;m not closing the book on him, this season, pitching for us,&#8221; Baldelli said.\nAs Park noted, Mahle&#8217;s start yesterday bore several similarities to the August 17 start that preceded his last IL visit.  In both outings, Mahle&#8217;s velocity was down, and he threw only 37 pitches.  The difference was that on August 17, Mahle still managed to hold the Royals scoreless in 2 1/3 innings, whereas the White Sox scored four runs in Mahle&#8217;s two innings yesterday en route to a 13-0 Chicago victory.\nThat loss dropped the Twins to 6-9 over their last 15 games.  Despite a losing record (37-43) since the start of June, Minnesota remains only one game back of the Guardians for the AL Central lead, with the White Sox a game behind in third place.  The division title may be the Twins&#8217; best path to the postseason, as the Twins have fallen five games back of the last wild card berth.\nGetting to the playoffs will be more difficult without Mahle, who is now the 17th player on the Twins&#8217; extensive injured list.  This list includes several notable regulars (i.e. Byron Buxton, Jorge Polanco, Ryan Jeffers, Trevor Larnach) who are tentatively expected to return in September, but the Twins can hardly afford to be without such key personnel for so long.\nSonny Gray is also a question mark after leaving his start on Friday due to hamstring tightness, as Baldelli said Gray would have to throw a bullpen session and pass other tests before being allowed to make his next start.  Gray is tentatively slated to start for Minnesota on Wednesday against the Yankees, but if he can&#8217;t pitch, that leaves the rotation even more short-handed.",

        "description": "Photo by Duane Burleson/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Royals can take a series here. The Royals head into the rubber match against the Tigers with a chance to win their first full series since taking three of four against the White Sox on August 9-11. \nMax Castillo goes on the hill for the Royals today, after they brought him up and optioned Wyatt Mills to Omaha. Castillo gave up just one run in five innings in his only outing for the Royals since being acquired from the Blue Jays.\nNate Eaton had four hits last night, but he sits today because that’s what the spreadsheet says.\n\n\nHere's how we're taking the field behind Max Castillo in the deciding game of our series vs. the Tigers.#TogetherRoyal pic.twitter.com/FazkFzp5n1— Kansas City Royals (@Royals) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Tigers will be without Miguel Cabrera, who landed on the Injured List today.

        "description": "Will this be the day Gunnar Henderson hits his first Camden Yards home run? | Brent Skeen-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Orioles go for the three-game sweep of the A’s, while hoping some of their wild card competitors finally lose. The Orioles have taken care of business so far this weekend. Unfortunately, so have their wild card competitors.\nThe O’s are doing what they’re supposed to do against a bad team, winning the first two against the AL-worst Athletics, but the Blue Jays have done the same in Pittsburgh, taking the first two against the woeful Pirates. The Birds remain 1.5 games behind Toronto for the third and final wild card spot. Tomorrow, at least, the Orioles will get to directly control their own destiny as the Jays come to Baltimore for a pivotal four-game series.\nThe O’s can’t look ahead just yet, though, as they’ve got one more game before the Athletics leave town. Spenser Watkins will look to pitch the Birds to a three-game sweep and bounce back from a rough outing in Cleveland, in which he retired the first 11 batters he faced before coughing up six hits and five runs in the blink of an eye.\nAdley Rutschman is DHing in this day game after a night game (with a doubleheader on deck tomorrow). Gunnar Henderson, whose first four major league games have seen him start at third base, shortstop, second base, and third base again, moves back to second this afternoon. As long as he’s in the lineup, I’m sure he doesn’t care which position. The O’s will be facing rookie right-hander Adrián Martínez, who has a 5.28 ERA in his first six MLB starts. Martínez has yet to work more than 5.1 innings in a start, so perhaps the Orioles will get another early look at the A’s bullpen.\nOrioles lineup:\nCF Cedric MullinsDH Adley RutschmanRF Anthony Santander1B Ryan Mountcastle2B Gunnar Henderson3B Ramón UríasLF Austin HaysSS Jorge MateoC Robinson Chirinos\nRHP Spenser Watkins\nAthletics lineup:\n2B Tony Kemp3B Vimael MachinDH Sean Murphy1B Stephen VogtC Shea LangeliersRF Seth BrownLF Cody ThomasSS Sheldon NeuseCF Cal Stevenson\nRHP Adrián Martínez",

        "description": "Photo by John Cordes/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Yankees try to avoid a sweep in the series finale at the Trop. The Yankees’ malaise continued on Saturday, losing 2-1 to the Rays, with the lone run coming on a ninth-inning Aaron Judge home run, when it was nearly too late. The loss saw them fall to just four games up on the Rays in the AL East, a long way away from what the lead once was. Today, they’ll need a win to keep that lead from dwindling even further.\nOn the mound for the Yankees for today’s series finale will be Frankie Montas. Against the Angels, Montas was having a solid outing before getting Ohtani’d, dooming him and the Yankees to another loss, and another sub-par outing since his acquisition. He has faced the Rays twice so far this season when he was with Oakland and put in good outings both times.\nMeanwhile for the offense, the “throw things at the wall and see what sticks” run continues. Oswald Peraza is back in the starting lineup, but moved over to second base for this one (Gleyber Torres is on the bench). That means Isiah Kiner-Falefa is indeed starting at shortstop, and his hitting sixth for ... reasons. Also, we get more Aaron Hicks because why not?\nFor the Rays, Shawn Armstrong will get the start, but that will be in an opener role. Ryan Yarbrough is expected to follow him and be Tampa Bay’s long man.\nCome join us in the game thread as the Yankees desperately try to get something going.\nHow to watch\nLocation: Tropicana Field - St. Petersburg, FL\nFirst pitch: 1:40 pm ET\nTV broadcast: YES Network, Bally Sports Sun, MLB Network (out-of-market only)\nRadio broadcast: WFAN 660/101.9, WADO 1380 (NYY), WDAE 620 AM/95.3 FM, WTMP (TB)\nOnline stream: MLB.tv\nFor updates, follow us on Twitter and Instagram, and like us on Facebook.\n\n\nWrapping up the road-trip. #RepBX Presented by @Hilton pic.twitter.com/TKmiWu4xRu— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n#Rays lineup going for sweep of #Yankees, with Choi at 1B: pic.twitter.com/ZrbAGWMwKM— Marc Topkin (@TBTimes_Rays) September 4, 2022",

        "description": "2:44PM: The Phillies officially announced Castellanos&#8217; placement, due to a right oblique strain.  To make room for Guthrie, the Phillies designated infielder Luis Garcia for assignment.  Garcia has hit .227/.323/.338 over 1407 career PA in Philadelphia&#8217;s farm system, and was still ranked 14th on MLB Pipeline&#8217;s list of the team&#8217;s top 30 prospects due to his defense and a seeming offensive breakout in A-ball in 2021.  However, Garcia has struggled badly this year at both the high-A and Double-A levels.\n12:21PM: The Phillies have placed outfielder Nick Castellanos on the 10-day injured list.  Outfielder Dalton Guthrie had his contract selected from Triple-A, and another 40-man roster move will be necessary to accommodate Guthrie&#8217;s addition to the active roster.\nCastellanos left Friday&#8217;s game due to an oblique injury, with manager Rob Thomson saying that the outfielder would undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the problem.  There hasn&#8217;t been any word on the results of the MRI, but even a lower-level oblique problem usually results in at least a minimal IL visit.  Castellanos and the Phillies can only hope that the injury is minor, as otherwise Castellanos could be in danger of missing the rest of the regular season and possibly the playoffs.\nIt has been an underwhelming season overall for Castellanos, who signed a five-year, $100MM free agent deal with Philadelphia in March.  The slugger is hitting only .265/.305/.397 over 531 plate appearances, resulting in a subpar 96 wRC+.  However, Castellanos has looked a lot more like his old self in recent weeks, with five home runs and a .318/.348/.505 slash line in his last 112 PA.\nWith Castellanos now sidelined, Matt Vierling figures to see much of the action in right field, as Vierling has already been filling in for the last couple of days and while Castellanos also recently missed time with a turf-toe injury.  Bryce Harper is still limited to DH duty and isn&#8217;t an option in the outfield, leaving Vierling, utilityman Nick Maton, and now Guthrie as the choices for right field playing time.\nGuthrie was a sixth-round pick for the Phillies in the 2017 draft, and the 26-year-old is now on the verge of his Major League debut.  He posted some middling numbers over his first three pro seasons, but hit well enough in 2021 to earn a promotion from Double-A to Triple-A, and Guthrie has continued to perform at the highest minor league level.  Over 513 total PA at Triple-A in 2021-22, Guthrie has hit .299/.354/.466 with 12 home runs and 23 steals (out of 30 chances).\nBeyond just outfield depth, Guthrie also offers the Phillies some versatility around the diamond, which could hint at Maton perhaps getting more work as an outfield-specific player.  Guthrie has played mostly center and right field this season at Triple-A, with only a handful of games as a second baseman, third baseman, and shortstop.  However, Guthrie was initially drafted as an infielder, and hadn&#8217;t played a pro game in the outfield until 2021.",

        "description": "The United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update on Sunday that Russian forces in Ukraine have likely not received combat bonuses, hampering morale.   \n\n\n\n“Russian forces continue to suffer from morale and discipline issues in Ukraine,” the ministry said in a Twitter thread. “In addition to combat fatigue and high casualties, one of the main grievances from deployed Russian soldiers probably continues to be problems with their pay.” \n\n\n\nIt said that Russian troops receive a modest salary and a variety of bonuses and allowances, noting the combat bonuses have not been paid since the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine. \n\n\n\n“This is probably due to inefficient military bureaucracy, the unusual legal status of the ‘special military operation’, and at least some outright corruption amongst commanders,” the ministry said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt added that Russia’s military has failed to provide deployed troops with \"basic entitlements\" such as appropriate uniforms, arms and rations, contributing to the military’s current “fragile morale.” \n\n\n\nThe update comes amid concerns of potential nuclear disaster across the European continent due to ongoing shelling near the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. Russian and Ukraine have blamed on one another.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRecently, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi announced that the agency plans to keep two inspectors at the Russian-captured nuclear power plant.\n\n\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine, which began in February, has killed thousands on both sides and displaced some 7 million Ukrainian citizens.",

        "description": "Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) on Sunday defended a primetime speech by President Biden last week, agreeing with the notion that U.S. “democracy is at risk.” \n\n\n\nCiting the risk to her own safety on Jan. 6, 2021, Murray told CNN \"State of the Union\" anchor Dana Bash that Trump supporters were willing to use \"brute force\" to halt the peaceful transition of power and denounced notions of political violence.\n\n\n\n“I believe that our democracy is at risk today. I was in the nation's Capitol on January 6. I wasn't able to escape. I was barricaded in an office. And I heard the pounding at the door, and I heard those who were outside of it willing to use brute force incited by President Trump to take over our country, to take over our democracy, to stop the transaction to a new presidency in a peaceful way, which is what a democracy is,\" Murray said.\n\n\n\n\"[W]e have to get back to a point where we all say that brute force and incitement of that brute force, and the questions that the president and his followers continue to put out there about whether or not that election was legitimate incites that,\" she said. \n\n\n\n\"And we still have people today saying there will be violence on the streets. That is not what a democracy is. And we all have to point that out and work to make sure we move towards a democracy and keep that democracy,\" she added.\n\n\n\nBiden in his speech on Thursday said that Trump's influence on the Republican party and on the MAGA-wing of the GOP was \"a threat to this country.\" \n\n\n\nBiden, speaking from Independence Hall in Philadelphia, tied Trump and other so-called “MAGA Republicans” to corrosive ideas like casting doubt on election results, spreading conspiracy theories and attacking law enforcement.\n\n\n\n“Not every Republican, not even a majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology,” Biden said. “But there’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.”\n\n\n\nBiden's remarks were lambasted by Republicans who have also called on him to apologize for saying that the MAGA philosophy was \"semi-fascism.\" In response to the pushback, White House officials defended criticisms that Biden’s speech was political, noting that defending democracy isn’t a partisan issue. \n\n\n\nMurray is  running for re-election in November for her Senate seat. She currently holds a slight lead over her opponent, Tiffany Smiley (R), according to a new Trafalgar Group poll where more than 49 percent of respondents said they will support Murray and 46 percent of those surveyed said they will support Smiley.",

        "description": "Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) on Sunday said he expects former Vice President Mike Pence to testify before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\n\n“Vice President Pence was the target of Donald Trump's wrath and fury and effort to overthrow the election on January 6, the whole idea was to get Pence to step outside his constitutional role, and then to declare unilateral lawless powers to reject Electoral College votes from the states,” Raskin, a member of the Jan. 6 committee, said on CBS “Face the Nation.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think he has a lot of relevant evidence, and I would hope he would come forward and testify about what happened,” Raskin said.\n\n\n\nPressed on options to force Pence to appear before the committee, Raskin said that a subpoena isn’t out of the question for Pence or any other potential witness, “but I would assume he's going to come forward and testify voluntarily, the way the vast majority of people have.”\n\n\n\nPence said last month that he would consider an invitation to appear before the committee, but said he’d have to “reflect on the unique role” he was serving as then-second in command and the “unprecedented” move for a vice president to testify on Capitol Hill.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe committee has long noted Pence as a key Jan. 6 figure, a target of former President Trump’s and his supporters during the Capitol riot.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump pressured Pence to disregard Electoral College votes from Biden-won states and use his ceremonial role in the election certification process to help Trump to victory. \n\n\n\nSome rioters in the Capitol that day called for the then-vice president to be hanged, and Pence's security detail later told the committee that they feared for their lives during the rioting.\n\n\n\nRaskin also said Sunday the committee is expected to release its much-anticipated report on its Jan. 6 findings by the end of this year.",

        "description": "Venice film festival: Emanuele Crialese’s drama of family dysfunction, starring Penélope Cruz, offers moments of glorious escapist fantasyEmanuele Crialese’s film is a drama of family dysfunction and multi-generational unhappiness: a story of quiet desperation and secret yearning in the hearts of teens and the middle-aged alike. Hollywood might set something like this in the ’burbs. Crialese places it right in the centre of racy and prosperous Rome in 1970.L’Immensità and its characters are reaching for something: some release, some consolatory epiphany, some immense personal revelation. And the gestures the film gives us along the way are intriguing, especially the glorious pop-choreography escapist fantasy sequences which are on a higher level of inspiration than anything else here. I don’t think L’Immensità quite encompasses what it’s straining for and I’m not sure that Penélope Cruz is directed towards her greatest strengths, very good though of course she always is. But Crialese has fervency and style and those fantasy worlds might even have a touch of De Sica’s miraculous Milan.L’Immensità screened at the Venice film festival Continue reading...",

        "description": "Since February, Google has sounded the alarm about the impending migration from the legacy Google Hangouts application in favor of Google Chat. Chat is meant to become Google&#8217;s single messaging solution, which provides rich-text editing, @ mentions, media and emojis, and seamless integration with other Workspace apps like Gmail and Spaces.\n\n\n\nGoogle has since then taken additional steps to urge Hangouts users to move over to chat. These include warning messages in the Hangouts mobile app and the Hangouts Chrome extension. Additionally, those still using Hangouts in Gmail on the web were automatically upgraded to Chat in Gmail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a final step in the migration, Google has announced that Hangouts on the web will begin redirecting to Google Chat on the web starting November 1, 2022. As a result, Hangouts will no longer be accessible from that date on.&#xA0;These changes will affect all Google Workspace customers and legacy G Suite Basic and Business customers.\n\n\n\nIt is unclear if there will be additional notices past this one to remind users of this final date. Since a subset of users still prefer Hangouts to Chat and are attempting to hold on to it until the last minute, there could be another warning towards the end of October. However, at this point, we should all accept this is happening no matter what, so all that&#8217;s left is embracing Chat and learning to love it as much as we did Hangouts.\n\n\n\nAdmin Info&#x2022; Admins should know that some conversations or portions of conversations won&#x2019;t automatically migrate from Hangouts to Chat for some users. However, you should receive an email notification with more details if this is the case for your domain.&#x2022; Admins should also inform their users about the upgrade from Google Hangouts to Google Chat.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

Hosted by the Minnesota Cricket Association, it includes teams primarily made up of Caribbean, Indian and other South Asian players Charles Peterson is one of the organizers of the USA Cricket Invitational. He says the association holds cricket games throughout the year and each team trains hard to compete. Peterson says making the finals is a big accomplishment for many players and a way for them to connect with others through their shared cultural tradition. “A lot of us are transplants or first generation Americans. We started playing and as the communities developed and you&#x27;ll still find it in immigrant communities.” Peterson said. That’s why we started the invitational, to try and make it into the broader [cricket] community.”Many of the players participating in the final games are from former British colonies, where cricket had a big influence and still remains popular today. Rishi Ragoonanan is a Minnesota cricket player for the International Cavaliers Cricket Club who came out to watch the game on Saturday. He says the sport means a lot to him and other players who immigrated to Minnesota from Caribbean and South Asian countries.“Just getting a taste of playing cricket and actually being able to do what you loved growing up, it&#x27;s a big plus,” he said. “These guys carry the culture from the homeland. We’ve got some really good players up here and the competition is high.”Ramesh Ailaveni, president of the Minnesota Cricket Association, stands in Bryn Mawr Meadows Park, site of the the USA Cricket Invitational. He said he&#x27;s glad the tournament is back after a break.Simone Cazares | MPRRamesh Ailaveni is President of the Minnesota Cricket Association. After the organization previously took a break from hosting the competition, he said he is excited to be back out on the cricket field. “We had huge representation over the years and now all the players in Minnesota cricket as well as people from outside are excited to be part of this,” he said. “There are people who travel and you know they have their own thing, but there are also so many players here who don&#x27;t want to go anywhere and just want to play cricket [in Minnesota]. So they&#x27;re excited and I&#x27;m excited for the team as well.”Peterson says the event is also focused on engaging their community. The halftime game will feature a steel drum performance and after the game, competitors and fans will come together with family events, food and music.“We believe people need to see cricket and they need to participate. The invitational was designed to get communities out to the park,” Peterson said. “We’ll have food, music and activities to encourage people to come out and watch cricket.”",

        "description": "Go get them, Lucas. We’re all behind you. | Kamil Krzaczynski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  I M A G I N E Last night’s 13-0 thrashing of the Minnesota Twins will be a hard act to follow, but do you know what might feel better than Dylan Cease’s one-hit masterpiece? If the Chicago White Sox swept the team who is currently standing between them and the first-place Cleveland Guardians. That’s what’s on the line this afternoon on the South Side.\nWhite Sox fans have been thirsty for something to cheer for. We’ve been in a baseball desert. Is this four-game winning streak a mirage, or are we finally seeing a semblance of the team that we were promised in the offseason? Today’s game could give us our answer. Can you imagine the mixture of relief and joy if the Sox not only completed a sweep of the Twins, but they did so led by struggling righthander Lucas Giolito? \nGiolito (10-8, 5.27 ERA) hasn’t been quite right for most of the season — least of all at home at Guaranteed Rate Field, where his ERA balloons to 6.86. It’s been really hard to watch, honestly. In his last start, Gio was bullied by 23-year-old rookie Nick Pratto for 5 ⅓ innings en route to a 9-7 loss to the Kansas City Royals. \nImagine, instead, if Giolito comes out today and shoves. It could happen. His ERA against the Twins this season is an impeccable 2.25. Combined with the fact that the White Sox offense has scored a combined 24 runs in the past three days? Imagine it, friends.\nFor the first time in a long time, it feels like anything is possible for the White Sox. It could be a special day on the South Side.\nInterim manager Miguel Cairo is doing his part by sending out a lineup that, for the most part, actually makes sense. It’s a little weird that Luis Robert was reinstated from paternity leave but not starting, but we’re on a winning streak, so I’ll give the new guy a pass.\n\n\nToday's #WhiteSox starters at Guaranteed Rate Field.⏰: 1:10 p.m. CT : @NBCSChicago  : @ESPN1000  : @FDSportsbook : O/U 3.5 CWS Total Runs pic.twitter.com/khXrKyTiPV— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Twins send ’em out like this:\n\n\nFinale on the South Side. #MNTwins pic.twitter.com/Yn1dh85YqU— Minnesota Twins (@Twins) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nToday’s game can be found locally in the usual places. First pitch is scheduled for 1:10 p.m. CT, but some rain in the area could delay the start. \nI’m ready. You’re ready. Are the White Sox ready? Let’s find out.",

        "description": "Photo by Patrick McDermott/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Ryan Pepiot called up, will pitch bulk innings Sunday night David Price was placed on the injured list with left wrist inflammation before Sunday’s series finale against the Padres, clearing the way for Ryan Pepiot to be called up from Triple-A to pitch for the Dodgers.\nPrice has a 2.58 ERA and 3.85 FIP in 38 relief appearances this season, with 37 strikeouts and six unintentional walks in 38⅓ innings. He only allowed four runs in his last 25 appearances, though two of those came in the last two weeks, allowing a solo home run to the Marlins in two different games.\nPrice last pitched on Monday in Miami.\n\n\nDavid Price said the wrist issue had been progressively bugging him over recent outings. Most directly impacts his grip strength trying to throw. Wanted to shut it down now so he can get back and pitch again this year.— Fabian Ardaya (@FabianArdaya) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nBy rule, optioned pitchers must remain in the minors for 15 days unless replacing someone going on the injured list, bereavement/family emergency list, or paternity leave. Pepiot was optioned on August 22, and would have otherwise needed to wait until Tuesday to be recalled.\nInserting Pepiot on Sunday gives the other members of the rotation an extra day of rest, beginning with Andrew Heaney, bumped from Sunday to Monday. Caleb Ferguson will start the series finale as an opener, with Pepiot following some time after.\nIn seven major league starts this season, Pepiot has a 4.02 ERA, 4.54 xERA, and 5.71 FIP with 36 strikeouts and 22 walks in 31⅓ innings. His 16.1-percent walk rate ranks seventh-worst in the majors among pitchers with at least 30 innings, though in his last start for the Dodgers, on August 21, Pepiot walked only two, lasting a career-high six innings with seven strikeouts to earn the win.\nPepiot only pitched once for Oklahoma City after getting optioned, allowing five runs (four earned) in five innings on August 27. He has a 2.58 ERA in 16 games in Triple-A this season, with 98 strikeouts and 35 walks in 80⅓ innings.",

Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) on Sunday said Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, has “relevant testimony” to share with the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\n\n“Speaking as only one member, I would say she has relevant testimony to render. And she should come forward and give it,” Raskin, a member of the committee, said on CBS “Face the Nation.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I don't want to overstate her role. We’ve talked to more than a thousand people. But we would like to hear from [former Speaker Newt] Gingrich [R-Ga.] and from her too,” Raskin added. \n\n\n\nGinni Thomas has come under scrutiny in connection with efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe conservative activist said she attended the pro-Trump “Stop the Steal” rally just before rioters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and reportedly communicated with former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about keeping then-President Trump in power.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMultiple news outlets reported last week that she also pressured state lawmakers to reject President Biden’s win in Wisconsin — following a June report that she did the same in Arizona.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHer political affiliations have also raised questions about a potential conflict of interest for her husband.\n\n\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said in July that the Jan. 6 committee was “fully prepared to contemplate a subpoena” if Ginni Thomas wouldn't testify before the committee voluntarily.\n\n\n\nThe committee has also asked Gingrich to voluntarily testify, alleging he advised the Trump team on its election loss.\n\n\n\nRaskin added Sunday that he expects former Vice President Mike Pence to “come forward and testify voluntarily” before the committee.",

        "description": "Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) said many Republicans were \"very offended\" by President Biden's primetime speech last week that called out former President Trump and MAGA Republicans as extremists and a threat to democracy.\n\n\n\nMcCaul told ABC's \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz that Biden's Philadelphia address from Independence Hall on Thursday night had the \"opposite effect\" of unifying the nation because calling Republicans \"a threat to democracy is really a slap in the face.\"\n\n\n\nRaddatz noted that shortly after Biden's speech, McCaul tweeted that attacking Republicans would only further divide the country, asking: \"When you look at those polls showing 60 to 70 percent of Republicans believe Joe Biden is not the legitimate president, what is Biden supposed to do when the country cannot even decide what democracy means?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, look, I mean, democracy is messy but it’s better than all the other forms of government. I think that if this was a speech to unify the American people, it had just the opposite effect. It basically condemned all Republicans who supported Donald Trump in the last election. That’s over 70 million people,\" McCaul responded, adding, \"saying that Republicans are a threat to democracy is really a slap in the face.\" \n\n\n\nWith a potential rematch of Biden and Trump seeking the presidency in 2024, McCaul said Biden is \"teeing up who the enemy is in his view.\" \n\n\n\n\"It [was] under the guise of a speech that’s to unite the nation, and I don’t think he succeeded in that,\" the Texas lawmaker said of Biden's address. \"I heard it personally back here in Texas, that a lot of Republicans were very offended by that speech.\"\n\n\n\nBiden — who portrayed the Republican Party as divided between the hardline MAGA faction and mainstream conservatives — was also slammed by Trump, who called the president an \"enemy of the state.\"\n\n\n\nRepublicans criticized Biden in the wake of his address, with some declaring him the \"divider in chief\" noting that it went against his 2020 campaign promise to unify the country.\n\n\n\nBiden has stepped up his criticism of Trump, notably mentioning him by name and calling out the MAGA-wing of the GOP and Trump's influence on the party as a danger to democracy.\n\n\n\nBefore Thursday's address, Biden had compared the MAGA philosophy to \"semi-fascism,\" drawing the ire of Republicans. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) last week said the president \"owes an apology\" to Republicans for the fascism comment, a call echoed by others in the GOP.\n\n\n\nThe grip of Trump's influence was on full display following an FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago property with Republicans fervently coming his defense in the immediate aftermath.  And eight of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him for the Jan. 6 rioting either resigned or lost against an opponent Trump backed.",

        "description": "U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan left Moscow on Sunday and will officially retire when he returns home, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Russia announced on Sunday.\n\n\n\nElizabeth Rood, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, will fill Sullivan's spot until his successor is appointed.\n\n\n\nSullivan, who was appointed to the ambassadorship in 2019 under former President Trump and remained on the job when President Biden assumed office, is retiring from a four-decade career that spanned five presidencies.\n\n\n\nThe Boston, Mass., native was previously a deputy secretary of State and held senior positions within the Departments of Justice, Defense, and Commerce.\n\n\n\nSullivan oversaw the embassy when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in late February and served as a key point of contact between U.S. officials and Russian leaders.\n\n\n\nThe retiring ambassador was extremely critical of the Russian invasion, telling Voice of America (VOA) in June the war was a “massive act of aggression\" that has killed thousands of people and displaced millions. \n\n\n\nHe also praised Ukraine and Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelensky for standing up for their freedom and pushing Russians out of the capitol and into the eastern region of the country, where fighting remains without a decisive victory on either side.\n\n\n\n\"I'm not a military expert, but I say this just as a human being, what President Zelenskyy and his government has done to resist this massive aggression is inspirational,\" Sullivan said. \"I don't think the Russian government expected the Ukrainian government to stand firm and resist.\"\n\n\n\nSullivan also played a key role in bringing former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed back to the U.S. this spring after he was detained in Russia. \n\n\n\nOfficials are continuing to work on releasing other American citizens they consider wrongfully detained, including WNBA star Brittney Griner and another former U.S. Marine, Paul Whelan.\n\n\n\nBut with the U.S. continuing to support Ukraine financially and defensively, tensions with Russia have soared to new highs, complicating negotiations.\n\n\n\nIn the June interview with VOA, Sullivan said the invasion was the \"decision of a government, really one person,\" calling out Russian President Vladimir Putin by name.\n\n\n\n\"I've been in Moscow well over two and a half years now, and from the day I arrived, there's been a snowball rolling of the gradual repression of civil rights, civil society, journalists,\" he said. \"There's an underlying sense, I believe, in Russia that something's wrong and what's happening in Ukraine is wrong.\n\n\n\n\"You can sense this lurking. People want to know: When is it going to stop? When is it going to go back to being the way it was?\" he continued. \"And the message is, unfortunately, it's not going to be any time soon.\"",

        "description": "In 2016, Hillary Clinton warned that Donald Trump was a fool who could be baited with a tweet. This past Thursday night, in Philadelphia, Joe Biden upped the ante by asking, in effect: What idiot thing might the former president do if baited with a whole speech? On Saturday night, the world got its answer.For the 2022 election cycle, smart Republicans had a clear and simple plan: Don’t let the election be about Trump. Make it about gas prices, or crime, or the border, or race, or sex education, or anything—anything but Trump. Trump lost the popular vote in 2016. He lost control of the House in 2018. He lost the presidency in 2020. He lost both Senate seats in Georgia in 2021. Republicans had good reason to dread the havoc he’d create if he joined the fight in 2022.So they pleaded with Trump to keep out of the 2022 race. A Republican lawmaker in a close contest told CNN on August 19, “I don’t say his name, ever.”Maybe the pleas were always doomed to fail. Show Trump a spotlight, and he’s going to step into it. But Republicans pinned their hopes on the chance that Trump might muster some self-discipline this one time, some regard for the interests and wishes of his partners and allies.[David Frum: The justification for Biden’s speech]One of the purposes of Biden’s Philadelphia attack on Trump’s faction within the Republican Party was surely to goad Trump. It worked.Yesterday, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Trump addressed a rally supposedly in support of Republican candidates in the state: Mehmet Oz for the Senate; the January 6 apologist Doug Mastriano for governor. This was not Trump’s first 2022 rally speech. He spoke in Arizona in July. But this one was different: so extreme, strident, and ugly—and so obviously provoked by Biden’s speech that this was what led local news: “Donald Trump Blasts Philadelphia, President Biden During Rally for Doug Mastriano, Dr. Oz in Wilkes-Barre.”Yes, you read that right: Campaigning in Pennsylvania, the ex-president denounced the state’s largest city. “I think Philadelphia was a great choice to make this speech of hatred and anger. [Biden’s] speech was hatred and anger,” Trump declared last night. “Last year, the city set an all-time murder record with 560 homicides, and it’s on track to shatter that record again in 2022. Numbers that nobody’s ever seen other than in some other Democrat-run cities.”Trump spoke at length about the FBI search of his house for stolen government documents. He lashed out at the FBI, attacking the bureau and the Department of Justice as “vicious monsters.” He complained about the FBI searching his closets for stolen government documents, inadvertently reminding everyone that the FBI had actually found stolen government documents in his closet—and in his bathroom too. Trump called Biden an “enemy of the state.” He abused his party’s leader in the U.S. Senate as someone who “should be ashamed.” He claimed to have won the popular vote in the state of Pennsylvania, which, in fact, he lost by more than 80,000 votes.The rally format allowed time for only brief remarks by the two candidates actually on the ballot, Oz and Mastriano. Its message was otherwise all Trump, Trump, Trump. A Republican vote is a Trump vote. A Republican vote is a vote to endorse lies about the 2020 presidential election.On and on it went, in a protracted display of narcissistic injury that was exactly the behavior that Biden’s Philadelphia speech had been designed to elicit.[David A. Graham: Trump can’t hide from the Mar-a-Lago photo]Every day since the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago has brought new proof that Trump still dominates the Republican Party. He has extracted support even from would-be rivals like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis—rituals of submission within a party hierarchy that respects only acts of domination.Republican congressional leaders desperately but hopelessly tried to avert the risk that this next election would become yet another national referendum on Trump’s leadership. Despite Trump’s lying and boasting, politicians who can count to 50 and 218—the respective numbers needed for a majority in the Senate and House—have to reckon with the real-world costs of Trump’s defeats. But Biden understood their man’s psychology too well.Biden came to Philadelphia to deliver a wound to Trump’s boundless yet fragile ego. Trump obliged with a monstrously self-involved meltdown 48 hours later. And now his party has nowhere to hide. Trump has overwritten his name on every Republican line of every ballot in 2022.Biden dangled the bait. Trump took it—and put his whole party on the hook with him. Republican leaders are left with little choice but to pretend to like it.",

        "description": "Former Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Charlie Dent on Saturday said former President Trump’s speech at a rally on Saturday night in the Keystone State was a “major gift” for Democrats. \n\n\n\n“Most Republican candidates don't want anything to do with Donald Trump in this general election. They want this to be about Joe Biden and the Democrats, but to the extent Trump inserts himself into this conversation, he's giving the Democrats a major gift right now,” Dent said on CNN.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Wilkes-Barre, Pa., rally was billed as support for Republican Senate candidate Mehmet Oz and gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano — but it was also Trump’s first after the FBI executed a search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago residence and recovered classified documents kept after the end of his presidential term.\n\n\n\n“I am not so sure that the former President Trump did anyone any good with that speech tonight. Just by showing up in Pennsylvania, he is making the election much more about himself,” Dent said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOz, a cardiothoracic surgeon and TV personality, has been falling behind Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman in the state’s Senate race, per recent polling. \n\n\n\n\"Mehmet Oz I don't think wants to be anywhere near Donald Trump in this fall election. It doesn't do him any good. He needs to win swing voters and independents and some Democrats, and it's hard to do that when Trump is really just playing and pandering to the base,” Dent said.  \n\n\n\nTrump during the rally lambasted the FBI for the Mar-a-Lago search, knocking it as “one of the most shocking abuses of power by any administration in American history.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the wake of criticisms from Trump and his supporters, FBI agents have weathered an uptick in attacks against law enforcement. \n\n\n\nDent on Saturday pushed back against the outrage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If any member of Congress absconded with classified material, I can assure you that a G-man, somebody from the FBI, would have showed up at their homes and demanded that they return that information,” Dent said. \n\n\n\nDent represented Pennsylvania in Congress from 2005 until his retirement in 2018. He's now a political commentator for CNN.\n\n\n\nDent and a group of former Pennsylvania Republican officials endorsed Democratic state Attorney General Josh Shapiro over their party’s nominee, Mastriano, in the gubernatorial election. Dent has called Mastriano “an extremist who is a threat to the rule of law and the constitutional order.”",

        "description": "Rep. Sean Maloney (D-N.Y.) on Sunday said President Biden and House Democrats are \"on the way back\" after several legislative victories in the past month.\n\n\n\nMaloney, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), told \"Fox News Sunday\" anchor Mike Emanuel that passing the climate, tax and healthcare Inflation Reduction Act, as well as a bipartisan gun control bill and expanded healthcare for military veterans, were impactful accomplishments.\n\n\n\n\"That's the kind of agenda that we’re standing in support of and you see it working in the polls,\" he said. \"The president is on the way back and so are House Democrats.\"\n\n\n\nMaloney said Democrats are ready to stand with the president and campaign with him to tout these legislative victories. He also promised that \"celebrations\" were on the way.\n\n\n\nDemocrats appear to be gaining ground ahead of the November midterm elections after winning a special bellwether election in New York and a competitive Alaska House race.\n\n\n\nThe nonpartisan Cook Political Report this week shifted five more seats in favor of Democrats, and revised down their November forecast from Republicans winning 15 to 30 seats to winning 10 to 20 seats.\n\n\n\nThe major Democratic spending package passed last month imposed a minimum tax on the biggest corporations, capped prices on prescription drugs through Medicare and allocated $369 billion to fighting climate change, the largest such investment ever. \n\n\n\nDemocrats have also enacted a law seeking to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry to make it more competitive with China. \n\n\n\nThe victories have propped up Biden's job approval rating with Americans to 40 percent after the president had lingered in the 30 percent range for months.\n\n\n\n\"You better believe Democrats are going to celebrate that. So are the voters,\" Maloney said of the successes on \"Fox News Sunday.\"",

        "description": "Photo by Zac BonDurant/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Diamondbacks have an extra inning problem \n\nToday's Lineups\n\n\n\n\nBREWERS\nDIAMONDBACKS\n\n\n\n\nKolten Wong - 2B\nDaulton Varsho - RF\n\n\nWilly Adames - SS\nEmmanuel Rivera - 3B\n\n\nRowdy Tellez - 1B\nJosh Rojas - 2B\n\n\nHunter Renfroe - RF\nChristian Walker - 1B\n\n\nKeston Hiura - DH\nJake McCarthy - DH\n\n\nLuis Urias - 3B\nCorbin Carroll - LF\n\n\nOmar Narvaez - C\nCarson Kelly - C\n\n\nTyrone Taylor - CF\nAlek Thomas - CF\n\n\nEsteury Ruiz - LF\nGeraldo Perdomo - SS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJason Alexander - RHP\nZac Gallen - RHP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe loss last night dropped the D-backs’ record in extra-inning games this season to 3-5, which isn’t bad. But it conceals a problem on the pitching side of things. Now, given the presence of the Manfred man starting on second in every frame after the ninth, it will be more difficult than usual to stop the opposition from scoring. But it still happens. Over the 488 extra (half) innings played in the majors this year, 188 of them have resulted in the team scoring zero runs. That’s a 37% rate. However, of the 12 extra innings pitched by Arizona in 2022, they have kept the opposition off the board only once (an 8%) rate. On June 21 in San Diego, Kyle Nelson and Sean Poppen combined for a scoreless 10th. We still lost, 3-2 in 11. \nAll told, Arizona has allowed 15 runs over 12 innings in extra, an average of 1.25, while scoring 11 (0.92 average). The average across MLB is 1.01 runs per extra inning. However, Arizona’s ERA in extras is 3.27, which is actually better than the MLB average there of 3.65. Why the difference? It’s because the Manfred Man does not factor into ERA: if he scores, it counts as unearned. That’s the run the Diamondbacks have had problems with: of the fifteen they have allowed, eleven were unearned: things like last night’s home-run off Joe Mantiply (scoring one earned and one unearned) have been the exception. That 73% unearned rate in extras is higher than the 65% figure across all of the majors this season. \nYou won’t be surprised to hear that Mark Melancon has allowed almost half of all extra-inning runs by a D-backs, with seven over his five appearances. Ian Kennedy has three: Poppen and Mantiply two apiece and Noe Ramirez one. Between them our ex-closer and current closer have been responsible for almost two-thirds of all extra inning plate appearances, but have been hit at a disturbing .387 average (12-for-31). While only two hits have gone for extra bases (both doubles), it’s still an .863 OPS for the pair combined in extras. With the MLB average being 85 points lower at .778, it’s not hard to work out why the team has struggled to post those goose-eggs more than most teams.\nAlso today: a streak, but I’m too superstitious to talk about that!",

        "description": "The Angels announced that the Giants have claimed infielder/outfielder Jose Rojas off waivers.  San Francisco has also announced the move, with Brandon Belt (who is undergoing season-ending knee surgery) moved to the 60-day injured list to create space for Rojas on the 40-man roster.  Rojas and outfielder Steven Duggar were both designated for assignment by the Angels on September 1.  Duggar cleared waivers and opted to become a free agent, rather than accept an outright assignment to Triple-A.\nRojas will change teams for the first time in his pro career, as he has been an Angel since being selected in the 36th round of the 2016 draft.  (And, Rojas is even an Anaheim native.)  After posting some nice numbers in the minors, Rojas has seen some big league playing time in each of the last two seasons, resulting in a .188/.245/.339 slash line over 241 total plate appearances.  Much of that modest production came in 2021, as Rojas had a .676 OPS last season but only a .301 OPS in 57 PA this year.\nAs noted, the minor leagues was a different story for Rojas, who slashed .287/.347/.503 with 90 home runs over 2298 career PA in the Angels farm system.  The hitter-friendly environment of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League is certainly a factor in gauging Rojas&#8217; numbers, but overall, it is easy to see why the Giants might have interest in the 29-year-old.  San Francisco has also favored versatile players, and Rojas fits that model with his experience at third base, second base, first base, and both corner outfield spots.\nDuggar is a former Giant himself, spending his first five MLB seasons in the Bay Area before being traded to the Rangers for Willie Calhoun in June.  Duggar didn&#8217;t last long in Texas, as the Rangers DFA&#8217;ed him in early August and the Angels claimed him away a few days later.\nWhile Duggar has been a strong defensive player during his career, he has had trouble staying healthy and generating any kind of consistent production at the plate.  Duggar has had a few flashes of offensive protential, but over 846 career PA, he has hit only .236/.293/.367.  All of the changes of scenery haven&#8217;t helped his bat this year, as Duggar has just a .447 OPS over 80 combined PA with Anaheim, Texas, and San Francisco.  Now that he&#8217;s back on the open market, it&#8217;s possible to see another team in need of outfield depth or a defensive boost inking Duggar to a minor league contract.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/farhan-zaidi-discusses-giants-offseason.html",
        "description": "After winning 107 games in 2021, the Giants have taken a big step backwards, with only a 63-68 record this season.  Pretty much everything clicked during that dream season, but injuries and under-performance have marred San Francisco&#8217;s efforts this year, with the bullpen and much of the lineup being particularly inconsistent.\nAs a result, some notable changes could be in store for the 2023 club.  In an interview on The Front Office on MLB Network Radio on SiriusXM (partial audio clip), Giants president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi said that &#8220;everything is on the table for us&#8221; this offseason, &#8220;including going out and being aggressive at the top end of the free agent market.&#8221;\nZaidi has yet to make any true big-ticket signings since taking over the front office in November 2018, preferring shorter-term deals with both free agents or in-house players.  This isn&#8217;t to say that the Giants have been necessarily adverse to spending in general, considering that the club&#8217;s current payroll is around $162.3MM (as per Roster Resource).  However, even that total is below the team&#8217;s spending levels prior to Zaidi&#8217;s tenure, as payroll topped the $200MM mark in 2018 before Zaidi was hired.\nOf course, that payroll was inflated by several large contracts given to veteran players and stalwarts of the Giants&#8217; three World Series championships, and by 2018, most of those players were no longer productive.  Rather than entirely rebuild, Zaidi took a more measured approach to moving some but not all of those larger deals, and this strategy was a big part of the Giants&#8217; sudden success in 2021.  Such underperforming veterans as Brandon Crawford, Brandon Belt, Buster Posey, Evan Longoria, and Johnny Cueto were generally healthier and much more productive on the field, with the revamped coaching staff helping these players find their old form.\nPosey retired, while Cueto wasn&#8217;t re-signed and instead landed with the White Sox.  Crawford was given a contract extension before the 2021 season was even over, and Belt was also retained when he accepted San Francisco&#8217;s one-year qualifying offer.  As it turned out, it seems like the Giants may have simply waited a year too long with these players, as Crawford and Belt have struggled, and Longoria has hit well when healthy but has also played only 69 games.\n&#8220;We had a bunch of veteran players when I came in whose contracts were going to be up last offseason and this coming offseason,&#8221; Zaidi said, describing this period &#8220;as a time of big transition for our organization.&#8221;  Considering how well the Giants played in 2021, &#8220;it made sense for us to not be too aggressive with the transition and retrench a little bit with the guys who had had that successful season for us.&#8221;\nWith things not working out in 2022, Zaidi finally seems ready to turn the page on this version of the Giants roster.  Belt, Joc Pederson, and Wilmer Flores are all free agents, while Longoria&#8217;s $13MM club option will likely instead be bought out for $5MM (and, Longoria might retire altogether at season&#8217;s end).  Zaidi said earlier this week that the Giants have already talked to Pederson about an extension, and Flores has still been productive enough that he could be considered for another deal at a relatively low cost.\nHow many veterans are kept, however, will tie into Zaidi&#8217;s plan for a younger roster.  As he noted in the Front Office interview, &#8220;we find ourselves in a position this offseason where we want to get more athletic.  We want to have a roster that has a better chance of staying healthy, which usually means getting a little bit younger.&#8221;\nThis strategy will also impact the Giants&#8217; free agent plans.  Health is naturally always a concern for any team in deciding whether or not to sign a free agent, especially since most players are generally in their late 20&#8217;s or early 30&#8217;s by the time they earn enough service time to reach the open market.  Looking at some of the top free agents available this winter, pretty much everyone has some level of injury history, though if youth is more of a factor for San Francisco, players like Carlos Correa (who turns 28 this month) or Trea Turner (who turns 30 in June) could be prioritized.  Aaron Judge will be 31 in April, but the Bay Area native has been speculated as a natural target for his old hometown team.\nBesides free agents, the Giants could also obviously look to add players in trades, though getting younger and more athletic types will naturally come at a higher cost in terms of trade return.  Since the Giants have only around $89MM on the books for 2023, Zaidi could perhaps look to lower the prospect cost by taking on a larger contract, and using the Giants&#8217; financial flexibility in another way than just spending on a free agent.",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/pixel-face-detection-auto-rotate",
        "description": "I&#8217;m sure you can relate to how annoying it is to lie down while using your phone and have your phone&#8217;s display rotate to landscape orientation. This particular scenario was responsible for people turning off auto-rotate on their phones altogether and manually enabling it as needed.\n\n\n\nBut what if I told you that you no longer have to do this? Beginning with Android 11, the auto-rotate feature became more helpful by relying on the accelerometer to determine the correct orientation. This was improved on in Android 12 by introducing the use of the front-facing camera to make this feature even smarter and use the position of your face as a guide.\n\n\n\nTo turn that feature on a Pixel device, like the Pixel 6 or Pixel 6a, first, go to your device&#8217;s Settings. Next, scroll down to and select &#8220;Display.&#8221; Scroll down once again and select &#8220;Auto-rotate screen,&#8221; but don&#8217;t turn on the toggle here, instead tap on it to see more options. You will then see an option to toggle-on auto-rotate and one to use &#8220;Face Detection.&#8221; Select both options from this screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce these two options are turned on, if your device is running Android 12 or newer, you will be able to hold your phone in any position &#x2014; and as long as the selfie camera can see your face &#x2014; it should not prompt you with the auto-rotate icon at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n\n\nI just want the steps!\n&#x200B;\n   Go to your phone&#8217;s Settings\n   Select Display\n   Tap on Auto-rotate screen, but don&#8217;t turn on the toggle from here\n   Toggle on Use Auto-rotate and then Enable Face Detection",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/how-to-disable-duplicate-chromeos-notifications",
        "description": "The Chromebook notification tray has recently received a huge visual refresh, and quite honestly, it looks gorgeous. I had initially predicted it with my Material You for ChromeOS mockup, and now that it&#8217;s here, it feels like just another part of the operating system. All in all, it along with the new Productivity launcher have taken Google&#8217;s laptop OS from rudimentary and passable to polished and beautiful.\n\n\n\nThat&#8217;s not to say that everything regarding the notification system is perfect, however, and if you have apps from the Google Play Store installed alongside standalone web applications, then you&#8217;ll be no stranger to the idea of receiving double notifications for YouTube, Gmail, and so on.\n\n\n\nToday, I&#8217;m going to show you how to manage this, and ultimately, how to turn off one set of pings so that your tray doesn&#8217;t look absolutely and unnecessarily cluttered throughout the day! As you can see below, I have a YouTube notification from one of my favorite Nintendo content creators &#8211; RGT 85 &#8211; via the YouTube Android app.  Just below that, I have the same exact notification, only it&#8217;s from the Chrome browser. This happens all the time, but there&#8217;s an easy way to prevent it from occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost people who have an app installed will no longer wish to be notified via the browser itself about updates from websites they use, so toggling Chrome would be ideal in this case. Last year, Google made it to where you no longer have to enter the browser to manage website notifications (though you still can), and instead began housing them in the ChromeOS settings via the shelf.\n\n\n\nDid you know: If you want to keep website notifications turned on and disable notifications from apps instead, you can simply manage these individually through each app!\n\n\n\nYou can actually see these by opening the quick settings panel at the bottom right of your display (click the clock!) and clicking the arrow just to the right of the settings cog to expand it fully. Then, you should see a &#8216;Notifications&#8217; section. If you click the arrow just under that to see that section&#8217;s details, you will encounter a full list of all of the apps and web apps installed on your Chromebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the image above, you can toggle app badging here (the notification dot that appears at the top of an app icon when you have new information to view), as well as the do not disturb option. In the list, there are checkboxes to the left of each item, and toggling these will allow or prevent that specific app or PWA from showing notifications in your tray.\n\n\n\nIn the case of YouTube, you wouldn&#8217;t want to disable the Android version (labeled &#8216;YouTube&#8217;), but rather the web app labeled by its website URL. Here, it&#8217;s listed as &#8220;https://www.youtube.com:443&#8221;. If you compare the first and second image, you&#8217;ll notice that the web-based notifications have now disappeared from my shelf for YouTube.\n\n\n\nIf you don&#8217;t want to hassle with the shelf, you can also simply open the Settings app on your Chromebook and navigate to &#8220;Apps &gt; Notifications&#8221; and toggle them here, but I&#8217;ve noticed there&#8217;s no way to tell the difference between websites and apps in this section. For this reason, I prefer the method I covered first, and I hope you do too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just want the steps!1. Click the clock at the bottom right of your Chromebook shelf2. Expand the quick settings with the arrow icon3. Click the arrow just under the &#8220;Notifications&#8221; icon or the word &#8220;Notifications&#8221; itself (not the icon!)4. Scroll down and locate the listings marked by website URLs. 5. Click the checkboxes next to them to disable each web app6. Alternatively, manage them via Chrome or turn them off all at once7.

top executive for American retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond died after falling from a New York City skyscraper, authorities said Sunday. \n\n\n\nThe New York City Police Department said the company's chief financial officer, Gustavo Arnal, fell from a downtown Manhattan skyscraper often referred to as the \"Jenga building.\"\n\n\n\nArnal was pronounced dead at the scene, and the investigation into his death remains ongoing, authorities said. \n\n\n\nArnal’s death comes after Bed Bath &amp; Beyond announced plans to close 150 of its low-performing stores in the U.S. The New Jersey-based company also plans to cut 20 percent of its staff and has acquired more than $500 million in new financing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Harriet Edelman, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's board chairwoman, expressed her condolences on Arnal’s death, noting his “leadership, talent and stewardship” during his time with the company.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nArnal, 52, joined the company in May 2020 after holding senior positions in other corporations such as Avon, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Procter &amp; Gamble, according to The New York Times.\n\n\n\n\"I am proud to have been his colleague, and he will be truly missed by all of us at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him,\" Edelman said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"Our focus is on supporting his family and his team and our thoughts are with them during this sad and difficult time. Please join us in respecting the family's privacy,\" she added.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/3628953-michigan-secretary-of-state-says-officials-worried-about-violence-and-disruption-on-election-day/",
        "description": "Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) on Sunday said election officials nationwide are most worried about “violence and disruption” as the midterm elections approach.\n\n\n\n“Violence and disruption on Election Day, first and foremost, and in the days surrounding the election,” Benson told CBS “Face the Nation” chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett when asked about her biggest concern.\n\n\n\n“Secondly, there's a concern about the ongoing spread of misinformation, which, of course fuels the potential for additional threats, harassment and even violence on Election Day,” Benson added.\n\n\n\nDespite her worries, Benson noted that election officials have been working for roughly two years to protect the integrity of the election process, an effort she described as a success “at every turn,” vowing to seek accountability for anyone who attempts to interfere with November’s midterm contests.\n\n\n\n“Democracy prevailed in 2020,” she told Garrett. “There have been, in Michigan and in other states, no significant attempts apart from the tragedy in our Capitol on Jan. 6 to really see disruption of the polling places on Election Day itself.”\n\n\n\n“So we are, in many ways, even more prepared this year than ever before ... to ensure that we are eliminating, mitigating or certainly protecting the system against any potential disruptions,” Benson added.\n\n\n\nNearly two years after the 2020 presidential election, no evidence has emerged to suggest widespread fraud, but former President Trump and his allies have relentlessly attacked the nation's elections with claims of mass manipulation.Those unfounded claims include conspiracies related to voting machines, which at times have led to legal action, including a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News alleging the network purposely aired false claims about their machines for business purposes.\n\n\n\nWhen asked about her announcement on Thursday that the state government is investigating an alleged illegal sale of a voter assist terminal, Benson expressed concerns about the incident while portraying confidence in Michigan’s election security, saying the state conducts accuracy tests prior to every election and immediately decommissions any equipment found to be potentially compromised.\n\n\n\nMichigan’s Cadillac News had published an article indicating someone listed the machine, which disappeared from Colfax Township in Wexford County, on eBay. Michigan election law prevents citizens from withholding, breaking or destroying voting equipment as well as from obtaining “undue possession” of a voting machine.\n\n\n\nBenson on Sunday clarified the machine in question did not tabulate votes but rather was used to assist voters needing assistance with marking their ballots.\n\n\n\n“It's important to note that that's happening in this era of misinformation where people are quick to seize on the potential for machines to be somehow insecure, and our work in Michigan is to ensure that any machine that is illegally accessed or even tempted to be illegally accessed is decommissioned and we only have secure machines in play on Election Day,” Benson said on CBS.",

The weather was still great, meaning that while public transport was on strike I enjoyed cycling into the city.\nThis week I\n\nParticipated in a session where two of my clients were discussing a collaboration. As I do work for both my role was one of translating things said by one into the terms used by the other and vice versa, and thus bridge the differences in vocabulary and context.\nWrote a detailed plan for an ethics committee for the Dutch provinces. One where the output is not a yes or no answer like research ethics boards, but research based guidance w.r.t. the agency of provinces in the context of their specific public tasks\nWatched butterflies get drunk from enjoying the fermenting and rotting apples that drop out of our tree\nHad the weekly client meetings\nCelebrated E&#8217;s birthday\nDid some preparation for a session on EU legislation with the national statistics office\nPresented the plans for a provincial ethics committee twice, and started preparing for next week to run it b three different groups of decision makers to get approval to go ahead.\nHad a long and detailed discussion with a police organisation on a project proposal on AI ethics. Next week I&#8217;ll do a partial rewrite of the proposal to better fit their context and needed results\nHired a new team member, who will start next week.\nWrote a number of new Notions for my pkm, suprising myself with the volume of output\nDid a check on the progress of various EU initiatives w.r.t. data legislation and the planned dataspaces.\nFinished reading the things I wanted to read in a 1930s book of some curiosa interest to the pkm community\nTook Y to her weekly swimming lesson\nSpent a nice day with E and Y cycling through the fields just north of here, drinking coffee on a farm, and having lunch at the midway point.\nStarted outlining my upcoming talk at Netherlands WordCamp in two weeks, on integrating IndieWeb tools better into WordPress\nWrote down my experiences with Hypothes.is in the last month, and started a side project to interact with its API directly from my notes, and leaving the browser interface alone.\n\nCycling through the polders near the Laak river with E and Y\nThis is a RSS only posting for regular readers.

Alexander worked five innings of one-run ball against the Pirates last Tuesday. Houser appeared out of the bullpen the next day to finish off a 6-1 win against Pittsburgh.\nThe Brewers offense faces a tough draw in Diamondbacks right-hander Zac Gallen. The 27-year-old owns a strong 2.53 ERA and 3.16 FIP in 25 starts this year and hasn’t allowed a run in his last five starts.\nLineups:\n\n\nLast game in the desert  : @BallySportWI : @620wtmj #ThisIsMyCrew pic.twitter.com/FExhBbFjL8— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nGame 133. pic.twitter.com/rCbacUfjwa— Arizona Diamondbacks (@Dbacks) September 4, 2022",

        "description": "Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Rockies will look to seize game two of this double header and earn their first double header sweep since 2014. The Colorado Rockies have won their first double header game one of the 2022 season, breaking a six game streak in which they usually got trounced. Now they have the opportunity to take game two and earn their first double header sweep since 2014. The opponent is the same today as it was seven years ago: the Cincinnati Reds.\nOn the mound for the Rockies and making his 12th start of the season is the right-handed José Ureña. It’s been a tale of two pitchers for Ureña since he came to Colorado. After an astounding 6 2⁄3 inning first appearance where he gave up just one earned run against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Ureña will seemingly give up either two earned runs and net a quality start or he’ll give up five or more. Ureña had a solid outing his last time out against the Atlanta Braves where he pitched five innings and gave up two earned runs on six hits with six strikeouts. However, the outing before he gave up nine earned runs in 1 1⁄3 innings. We’ll see which Ureña we get this afternoon.\nOn the bump for the Redlegs is veteran righty Chase Anderson. Anderson is making just his second start of the season after being picked up by the Reds on a minor league deal in late August. Through two appearances Anderson has an ERA of 27.00, having given up eight runs (seven earned) over 2 1⁄3 innings with two home runs. Anderson has a career 5.22 ERA against the Rockies in 69 total innings of work and has given up 11 home runs to them. He throws a changeup, a four seam fastball, a sinker, a cutter, and a curveball.\nFirst Pitch: 1:50 AM MDT\nTV: AT&amp;T Sports Net Rocky Mountain; MLB.tv\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM; KNRV 1150 (Spanish)\nLineups:\n\n\nHow the #Rockies will line up for game two this afternoon. pic.twitter.com/lgtlPCRI70— Evan Lang (@evan_lang27) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nGame 2 on deck.

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/pirates-claim-peter-solomon-from-astros.html",
        "description": "The Pirates announced that they have claimed right-hander Peter Solomon off waivers from the Astros and optioned him to Triple-A Indianapolis. He was designated for assignment by Houston on Thursday. To make room for Solomon on their 40-man roster, the Pirates have transferred right Colin Holderman to the 60-day injured list.\nSolomon, 26, was a fourth-round draft selection of the Astros in 2017, meaning this will be his first time jumping to a new organization in his career. He pitched well as he climbed the minor league ladder but was limited to just 7 2/3 innings in 2019 before Tommy John surgery shut him down. He was likely to miss most of the 2020 season while recovering, though that became somewhat moot when the pandemic wiped out the minors that year.\nIn 2021, he returned to the hill and made his major league debut. He tossed 14 innings in the big leagues over six games, registering a 1.29 ERA in that small sample. He spent much more time in Triple-A, however, putting up a 4.70 ERA in the hitter-friendly Pacific Coast League along with a 26.3% strikeout rate. Here in 2022, it&#8217;s been a bit of a step back for Solomon, as he has a 5.20 ERA across 97 innings for the Sugar Land Space Cowboys with his strikeout rate dipping to 20.5%.\nDespite some of those unsavory numbers, there are reasons for the Pirates to take a flier on Solomon. Baseball America ranked him the #19 prospect in Houston&#8217;s system at their midseason update, noting that his five-pitch mix, command and durability give him the tools to potentially become a back-end starter in the big leagues. For a team that&#8217;s well out of contention and clearly focused on the future, it&#8217;s fairly logical to give Solomon a roster spot and see if he can flourish, especially now that he&#8217;ll be away from the PCL. This is Solomon&#8217;s second option year, meaning the Pirates can keep him stashed in the minors for the rest of this year and another campaign as long as he continues to hang onto a spot on the 40-man. The rotation is also fairly wide open, currently composed of Roansy Contreras, JT Brubaker, Mitch Keller, Bryse Wilson and Johan Oviedo. All of those guys are still works in progress to varying degrees, with none of them having reached their 29th birthday or 300 MLB innings pitched.\nAs for Holderman, 26, he was placed on the IL August 26 due to shoulder soreness. The Bucs evidently don&#8217;t expect him back this season since this transfer will rule him out beyond the end of the schedule. He made his MLB debut this year with the Mets before going to the Pirates in a trade for Daniel Vogelbach. He will finish his first season with a 3.81 ERA over 28 1/3 innings.\nJustice delos Santos of MLB.com tweeted the moves before the official announcement.",

        "link": "https://www.denverpost.com/2022/09/04/rockies-reds-doubleheader/",
        "description": "It was the best of times; it was the worst of times. It was a tale of the Rockies’ two seasons all wrapped into one doubleheader at Cincinnati&#8217;s Great American Ballpark on Sunday.\nAnd it said a lot about how far the Rockies have to go.\nAfter getting a solid start from German Marquez and timely hits in an 8-4 win in Game 1, the Rockies pitched poorly, fielded poorly, and were no-shows at the plate in a 10-0 loss to the Reds in Game 2.\nColorado finished its longest road trip of the season &#8212; 10 games in 11 days &#8212; with a 3-7 record. They have not swept a doubleheader since taking two from Cincinnati on Aug. 17, 2014, at Coors Field.\nRight-hander Jose Urena, a pending free agent who’s essentially auditioning for the Rockies (or another club) for next season, got torched in Game 2. The Reds lit him up for seven runs (six earned) on eight hits over 5 1/3 innings.\n&#8220;The biggest issue is that they bunched some hits together,&#8221; manager Bud Black told AT&amp;T SportsNet.\nUrena began his Rockies career with three consecutive quality starts in July, promising hope with a 1.45 ERA. He&#8217;s now saddled with a 6.19 ERA.\nThe Reds&#8217; five-run fourth inning featured a costly throwing error by third baseman Ryan McMahon, who threw wildly to the plate trying to nail Alejo Lopez. Not only did Lopez score so did Jose Barrero. McMahon&#8217;s 16 errors are the second-most in baseball, coming after a 2021 season when he was a Gold Glove finalist.\nCincy turned a victory into a rout with Aristides Aquino&#8217;s grand slam in the sixth off reliever Chad Smith. The Rockies, meanwhile, managed just four hits against a corps of Reds pitchers and were shut out for the 11th time this season.\nIn the first game, Colorado&#8217;s famished road offense feasted on the Reds&#8217; bullpen and Marquez continued his revival.\nReds rookie starter Nick Lodolo ruled the Rockies early on &#8212; he struck out nine and gave up two hits over six innings &#8212; but Colorado scored eight runs through the seventh and ninth innings to pocket a rare road victory.\nMarquez&#8217;s only two mistakes came against right fielder Nick Friedl, who hit solo home runs in the fourth and sixth innings. Marquez gave up three hits, struck out four, and walked three in his seven innings. He induced nine groundball outs.\nMarquez, erratic for much of the season, continues to sharpen up. He has a 3.93 ERA over his last nine starts and has given up just two runs on four hits over his last two outings.\n&#8220;German set a good tone, for sure, but so did their guy,&#8221; Black told AT&amp;t SportsNet. &#8221; &#8216;Marky&#8217; made two mistakes with a missed location on the fastball and he threw a breaking ball over the middle on the second (homer).\n&#8220;But he was very efficient early on and had a great pitch count. He had a very crisp seventh inning. He set a great tone, and he needed to.&#8221;\nRookie Michael Toglia&#8217;s bloop double behind down the right-field line in the eighth inning off Fernando Cruz drove in Brendan Rodgers for a 5-4 lead in what turned out to be the deciding run.\nColorado added three runs in the ninth, the key at-bat a two-run homer by C.J. Cron off right-hander Art Warren, Cron&#8217;s 25th homer of the season. The Rockies needed the insurance because Jonathan India hit a two-run homer off Carlos Estevez in the eighth, cutting the lead to 5-4.\nCharlie Blackmon&#8217;s clutch pinch-hit single in the seventh put the Rockies ahead, 4-2, giving them the lead for the first time in the game.\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe stories behind Albert Pujols (many) home runs vs. the Rockies: &#8220;It&#8217;s a homer I&#8217;ll never forget until the day I die.&#8221;\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSaunders: Truth is, Nolan Arenado was too good for the Rockies\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRoad-kill Rockies lose in walk-off fashion to Reds\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSpencer Strider strikes out 16 Rockies in Braves&#8217; 3-0 win\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRookie Michael Toglia homers, but Rockies lose to Braves\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\nBlackmon, who entered the game ranked third in the National League in hitting with runners in scoring position, is now batting .345 (39-for-111) in the clutch.\nThe Rockies open a six-game home stand on Monday afternoon against Milwaukee at Coors Field.\nIglesias injured. Shortstop Jose Iglesias injured his hand during an at-bat during the fourth inning and was removed from the game. Manager Bud Black told AT&amp;T SportsNet that Iglesias was being evaluated and would not be available for the second game of the doubleheader.\nIglesias entered the game with a .302 batting average, ranking seventh in the National League. He was third in the majors with a .336 road batting average and ranked sixth with a .357 average with runners in scoring position.\n\nOn Deck\nBrewers RHP Freddy Peralta (4-3, 3.56 ERA) at Rockies RHP Ryan Feltner (2-6, 5.78)\n2:10 p.m. Monday, Coors Field\nTV: ATTRM\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM\nThe growing pains continue for Feltner who&#8217;s coming off a loss at Atlanta where he allowed three runs on five hits and three walks while striking out seven batters across 5 2/3 innings. His seven strikeouts tied a career-high but he gave up costly home runs to Austin Riley and Ronald Acuna. He&#8217;s never faced Milwaukee.\nThe slumping Brewers are hoping Peralta can get them back on track. He last started on Wednesday vs. Pittsburgh and had\na no-decision in Milwaukee&#8217;s 6-1 win, allowing one run on two hits over five innings. Opponents are batting just .189 against him this season. Peralta is 2-1 with a 4.50 ERA in four career games (three starts) starts vs. Colorado.\nTrending: Cleanup hitter C.J. Cron is slowly getting back on track. The first-time All-Star hit a two-run homer in Colorado&#8217;s 8-4, Game 1 victory on Sunday at Cincinnati, though he was 0-for-3 in the Game 2 loss. He&#8217;s hit 13-for-45 (.289) with two home runs and eight RBIs in 12 games since sitting out the final two games of the San Francisco series on Aug. 20-21.\nAt issue: Second baseman Brendan Rodgers has been Colorado&#8217;s most consistent hitter for much of the season but he struggled during the just-completed 10-day road trip, going 3-for-36 with eight strikeouts.\nPitching probables:\nTuesday: Brewers RHP Brandon Woodruff (9-4, 3.54) at Rockies RHP Chad Kuhl (6-8, 5.19), 6:40 p.m., ATTRM\nWednesday: LHP Eric Lauer (10-6, 3.54) at Rockies LHP Kyle Freeland (7-9, 4.75), 1:10 p.m., ATTRM\nThursday: Off day",

        "description": "Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  There’s nothing good to say about how these past two games have gone. “Just wait until September,” Mets fans have been telling themselves for most of the 2022 season. While the Braves have been nipping at their heels for the past few months, it was easy to look at the schedule in September—when the Mets would almost exclusively be facing the worst teams that baseball has to offer—and come to the conclusion that if they just maintained a lead in the division heading into September, they’d be able to feast on the bad teams and lock up their first NL East title since 2015.\nWell, the thing is, that plan only works if they actually take care of business against these aforementioned bad teams. In theory, it shouldn’t be difficult—the Mets are clearly a more talented team than all of the squads they will be facing over these next few weeks. But baseball is a game filled with randomness, and the worst team in baseball can make a 100+ win team look like a joke on any given day. And these past two days, the lowly Washington Nationals have made the mighty New York Mets look like a joke. The result today was a 7-1 loss—a second straight embarrassing defeat to wrap up an embarrassing series defeat in which there is not much to feel good about.\nCarlos Carrasco made his return from the injured list today—the Mets made the curious choice to have him return without making a rehab start—and was immediately given a rude greeting by the Nationals, as he allowed a leadoff double to Lane Thomas and then an RBI single to Luis Garcia to quickly put the Mets in a 1-0 hole. Thankfully, Cookie rebounded to hold Washington to just the one run, giving the Mets an opportunity to come back against Erick Fedde. The bats went down quietly against him in the first inning, but managed to get on the board in the second, as they got two runners on to start the inning thanks to a Pete Alonso walk and a Daniel Vogelbach single. Jeff McNeil then brought a runner home with a sacrifice fly to center to tie the game at a run apiece, though the Mets would fail to score more in the frame.\nIn the top of the third inning, Carrasco got into trouble once again. After giving up a one-out single to Thomas, Garcia hit a ground ball to second that should have been a double play, but McNeil booted the ball while trying to make a transfer to Francisco Lindor, resulting in both runners being safe. Joey Meneses then singled to load the bases, and after Carrasco struck out Luke Voit for the second out, Keibert Ruiz singled to center to drive in two runs and make it 3-1. The Nationals unfortunately were not done there, as after a walk to once again load the bases, Ildemaro Vargas hit a single to left that a diving Mark Canha couldn’t quite come up with, scoring two more to make it 5-1. With that, Carrasco was done, and his performance—while undoubtedly hurt by the McNeil error which should have ended the third inning—leaves one to wonder whether he would have been better off making a rehab start before returning from the injured list.\nTrevor Williams replaced Carrasco and did his best to give the Mets some innings and keep the Nationals off the board, though he did give up a two-run home run to Cesar Hernandez (his first of the 2022 season) in the fifth inning. That was ultimately the only damage that Washington was able to do off him, and he was able to pitch 4.1 innings to help preserve the bullpen. But ultimately, the story of this game is not about Williams or Carrasco. The story of this game is the Mets offense and the fact that for the second straight day, they failed to do much damage against an objectively bad pitcher. The one run that they scored off Fedde—who came into this game with a 5.29 ERA—was the only one they managed to get against him in six innings of work. They didn’t even manage to threaten against him over the rest of his outing, as they failed to even get a runner in scoring position for his last four innings of work. When Fedde left the game in the seventh and the bullpen came on, the Mets finally got a runner in scoring position thanks to back-to-back singles by McNeil and Canha to lead off the inning—only for the Nationals to get a double play when Hernandez dropped a fly ball off the bat of Escobar in left and threw out the two runners who had retreated back to their bases. It was that kind of day for the Mets—whether due to poor performance or bad luck, they looked like they were destined to lose just about every step of the way.\nAnd lose they did, as the Mets once again failed to score or even threaten during those final couple of innings against the Nationals bullpen. Tommy Hunter threw two scoreless innings at the end of the game, but that doesn’t really matter, does it? The end result was still a 7-1 defeat and an embarrassing series loss. As mentioned at the top, baseball can be a very random game. That randomness means that it was always a possibility that the Mets would lose a series against one of the bad teams they were facing in September. Still, the main reason why the Braves have been able to hang on in this division race is because they defeated the bad teams with an almost lethal precision, and they’ve shown no signs of slowing down on that. If the Mets want to secure the NL East title that they’ve been fighting for all year, they need to make sure they’re doing a better job of beating the pitchers that they’re supposed to beat and beating the teams that they’re supposed to beat. They will get the chance to do that beginning tomorrow as they begin a series against the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nSB Nation GameThreads\nAmazin’ AvenueFederal Baseball\nBox scores\nMLB.comESPN\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs\n  \nWhat’s WPA?\nBig Mets winner: Daniel Vogelbach, +9.8% WPABig Mets loser: Carlos Carrasco, -40.9% WPAMets pitchers: -42.0% WPAMets hitters: -8.0% WPATeh aw3s0mest play: Daniel Vogelbach single in the second, +11.1 WPATeh sux0rest play: Keibert Ruiz two-run single in the third, +20.1% WPA",

        "description": "Gunnar and Adley will surely see many better games than this in their careers. | Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The O’s lost a lifeless finale to Oakland, dropping them 2.5 games out of a wild card spot. There’s just something about Sunday afternoons that brings out the worst in the Orioles recently.\nThe O’s suffered their seventh straight Sunday day game defeat, a total dud against the Athletics that ruined a sweep attempt and lost them costly ground in the wild card race. While the Orioles limped to their 5-0 loss at the hands of the AL’s worst team, the Blue Jays completed a sweep of the lowly Pirates to extend their wild card lead to 2.5 games over the Birds.\nToday’s game was exciting for approximately half an inning. Second baseman Gunnar Henderson began the tilt with a pair of outstanding defensive plays on the first two Athletics hitters, sending a roar through the crowd of Camden Yards crowd of 19,883. It was the last thing they’d have to cheer about all afternoon.\nThe O’s wasted a second-and-third, one-out rally in the bottom of the first on groundouts by Ryan Mountcastle and Henderson, and they never really threatened to score again. The A’s, meanwhile, took advantage of their opportunities against shaky O’s starter Spenser Watkins. In the second, the A’s lashed three consecutive singles, punctuated with an RBI knock by Sheldon Neuse (pronounced “noisy”). It was a noisy hit indeed, giving Oakland a 1-0 lead.\nWatkins got out of the second with no further damage, but the A’s were right back at it in the third. Watkins walked the leadoff man, Vimael Machin. His name, by the way, is pronounced “machine,” so this guy should really be batting behind Neuse. Who wouldn’t be intimidated by a Noisy Machine?\nWatkins then gave up a double to Stephen Vogt, and...oh wait! Move him between Neuse and Machin and now you’ve got a Noisy Vote Machine in the lineup.\nEnough wordplay! Get to the action! you shout impatiently. OK, if you insist, but it’s really all downhill from here for the Orioles. Shea Langeliers did what the O’s couldn’t, cashing in both RISP with a single to center, extending the A’s lead to 3-0. Watkins gave up another single later that inning and at that point had surrendered seven hits in the span of 14 batters. That’s not ideal. He did settle down long enough to work a perfect fourth and fifth, but Seth Brown greeted him with a leadoff homer in the sixth.\nIn the first two games of the series, by the way, Seth Brown was batting directly behind Sean Murphy, forming a lineup tandem of, yes, Murphy-Brown. Yet Candice Bergen was nowhere to be found.\nWhat did I tell you about wordplay?? you growl, pounding the table. Look, when your ballclub gets romped by a terrible team, you have to make up your own fun. The 4-0 deficit might as well have been 14-0 considering the Orioles’ total offensive blackout against rookie A’s starter Adrián Martínez, who had just six major league starts to his name entering the day.\nMartínez, a right-hander acquired from the Padres in the Sean Manaea trade in April, hurled the best start of his young career, flummoxing Orioles hitters with a nifty changeup that he wasn’t afraid to throw in any count. That failed first-inning rally was the closest the O’s came to scoring against Martínez, a stark contrast to the powerful Birds bats that blasted five home runs the previous night. The only other runner they put in scoring position was Jorge Mateo in the fifth, who walked and stole second (his 30th steal), but a Robinson Chirinos popout snuffed that modest threat. Two other Orioles reached base but both were erased on double plays, including one that ended the sixth and prompted Martínez to spike the ball in celebration.\nMartínez ended his afternoon with six scoreless innings. Two starts ago, he had a 6.08 ERA, but he gained a lot of confidence in his last outing by throwing 5.1 strong innings against the Yankees. So, as always, I blame the Yankees for this.\nAs for Watkins, he departed after allowing a leadoff single in the seventh, finishing with six innings of four-run ball. Not horrible, but not great, and nowhere good enough to earn him his first win since Aug. 1. Mop-up men Nick Vespi and Rico Garcia handled the rest of the game, with Vespi coughing up Brown’s second home run of the day, a Eutaw Street blast in the eighth, to make it 5-0.\nFor Oakland, relievers Joel Payamps, Domingo Acevedo, and A.J. Puk combined to complete the shutout and stifle the sweep.\nThe Orioles still emerged with a series win, which is nothing to sneeze at. But with the Blue Jays headed to town tomorrow for the most pivotal O’s series in the last half-decade, it would’ve been nice to see the Birds head into the battle on a positive note. Instead we got, well, this.",

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Saturday defended his recent warning of “riots in the streets” if former President Trump is prosecuted for his handling of classified materials.\n\n\n\n“What I tried to do was state the obvious,” Graham told CNBC’s Steve Sedgwick during an interview at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy.\n\n\n\n“Here’s what I said: The raid on President Trump’s home, the likely nominee for 2024, better bear some fruit here,” Graham continued. “If it’s just about mishandling classified information, we’ve had a standard set when it came to Hillary Clinton.”\n\n\n\nFederal agents executed a search warrant at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence on Aug. 8, when they recovered some 33 boxes containing more than 100 classified records.\n\n\n\nThe search was connected to the Justice Department’s investigation into whether Trump violated the Espionage Act and two other federal statutes, which do not rely on the records being classified. The investigations have led to swirling speculation about whether Trump will ultimately be prosecuted.\n\n\n\nGraham made the controversial remark last Sunday during an appearance on Fox News’s “Sunday Night in America” with host Trey Gowdy, a former lawmaker who chaired the House’s select committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi terror attack that uncovered a private email server used by Clinton.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If there’s a prosecution of Donald Trump for mishandling classified information after the Clinton debacle ... there’ll be riots in the streets,” Graham told Gowdy.\n\n\n\nGraham and other Republicans have repeatedly referenced the scandal in characterizing any potential prosecution of Trump as a double standard. Then-FBI Director James Comey described Clinton’s server as “extremely careless,” but the agency declined to prosecute her for mishandling classified information.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"Our country, the people on our side, believe that when it comes to the justice system, there are no rules regarding Trump,\" Graham said on Saturday, adding that its a case of \"'Get him. It doesn’t matter how you get him,' so I said that if it’s similar to what happened to Clinton and he gets prosecuted, it’ll be one of the most disruptive events in America.\"\n\n\n\nDuring the interview, the South Carolina Republican also defended his actions following the 2020 presidential election, which are now part of an ongoing court battle with the Fulton County, Ga., district attorney.\n\n\n\nFani Willis, the Democratic district attorney, has sought Graham’s testimony as part of her investigation into whether Trump or his allies unlawfully attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election in the state.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Graham has argued a constitutional provision protecting lawmakers from lawsuits and prosecution for things they say and do as part of their legislative work allows him to avoid testifying.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA federal judge on Thursday largely denied Graham’s bid to quash the subpoena; however, Graham said he remained confident his effort to avoid testifying would ultimately succeed. \n\n\n\n“I think the court is going to recognize that my activities as a United States senator was covered by the Speech and Debate Clause, that the county prosecutor’s desire to bring me down to Georgia oversteps the Constitution,” he told CNBC.",

        "description": "The Internal Revenue Service building stands on April 15, 2019 in Washington, DC.Zach Gibson/Getty ImagesPrivate information involving about 120,000 taxpayers was temporarily made public by the Internal Revenue Service, the agency announced on Friday.Confidential data from some Form 990-Ts, a business tax return used by tax-exempt organizations, was accessible to download on the IRS.gov website&#x27;s search engine for about a year, the Wall Street Journal first reported.The agency blamed a human coding error that went under the radar for months until an employee recently noticed the mistake. The IRS is required to notify Congress of any incident involving more than 100,000 individuals under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act. &quot;The IRS took immediate steps to address the issue,&quot; Anna Canfield Roth, the acting assistant secretary for management for the IRS, wrote in a letter to Congress on Friday.Taxpayer names and business contract information are among the data that was inadvertently disclosed, Roth said. But sensitive data like social security numbers, income information, or &quot;other sensitive information that could impact a taxpayer&#x27;s credit,&quot; were not released.The files have since been removed from the website, and the agency will replace them with the correct documents in the next few weeks. The IRS also plans to contact all the impacted filers. The agency said it is continuing to review the situation and will provide more details on the matter in the next 30 days.The blunder comes on the heels of Congress passing a historic tax, climate and healthcare bill that will bolster funding to the IRS for improvements.

        "description": "President Joe Biden argued that Donald Trump&#x27;s supporters pose a threat to U.S. democracy during an address billed as the &quot;battle for the soul of the nation&quot; at Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia on Thursday.Hannah Beier/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesWhen President Biden spoke on Sept. 1st, to tell the nation that democracy is in danger, his warnings echoed the words of many who have been paying attention. Especially those who study the past. Not a month earlier, the president met with a group of handpicked historians who told him that democracy was teetering, hanging on by a thread. After The Washington Post reported on the historians meeting, it didn&#x27;t take long for some to raise questions, not about the fact that democracy is in peril, but about the monochromatic makeup of those delivering that message. It seemed the Biden administration had only invited white experts to advise the president — four historians and one journalist: Princeton historian Sean Wilentz, University of Virginia historian Allida Black, presidential historians Michael Beschloss and Jon Meacham, who is also an occasional speechwriter for Biden, and journalist and Atlantic staff writer Anne Applebaum. But it wasn&#x27;t only the lack of diversity in that group, it was where that lack of diversity seemed to lead. &quot;They compared the threat facing America to the pre-Civil War era and to pro-fascist movements before World War II,&quot; read the Post&#x27;s sub-headline. Those comparisons leave out important parts of U.S. history that resonate today, says Kenneth Mack, a professor of law and history at Harvard. &quot;We don&#x27;t really have to look outside the United States, nor do we really have to look all the way back to the Civil War to think about things like voter suppression, demagoguery, and fascist tactics,&quot; he says. &quot;We&#x27;ve had the death of democracy happen right here, in the United States,&quot; says Mack. &quot;African Americans experienced this directly.&quot; He&#x27;s talking especially about the overthrow of Reconstruction, and all that followed, well up until the Civil Rights Movement.  Jelani Cobb, a New Yorker writer and the new dean of Columbia Journalism School, adds, &quot;The formative experience around American authoritarianism has been the treatment of people of African descent and people of Indigenous descent.&quot;  Cobb says the meeting missed the point. If you don&#x27;t examine how democracy has died for people of color in this country, you might miss how freedom fades not in big bombastic moments, but in slow ongoing repression. And if you exclude the voices of scholars and writers who understand an anti-democratic, fascist order as heritage, rather than an aberration, you might miss how democracy has before been pulled back from the brink. &quot;In having an all white room,&quot; Cobb says. &quot;you kind of replicate the kind of gaps in perspective that we&#x27;ve seen that have facilitated this problem in the first place.&quot; It&#x27;s Exactly What Is Happening Now Reconstruction was a bold plan to repair the wounds of slavery, and build out of the ashes of civil war a multiracial democracy. Rather than accept equality, it was violently overturned by Southern whites.  &quot;At the turn of the century we lost everything,&quot; says University of Connecticut Professor Manisha Sinha. &quot;It all went down the drain because of a very reactionary Supreme Court and because of state laws and local authorities who were willing to subvert elections and not allow people to vote.&quot; &quot;Sounds familiar?&quot; she asks. There was rising white supremacist domestic terrorism, lynchings and the reign of the Ku Klux Klan, and what Sinha describes as &quot;racist authoritarianism.&quot; In many ways, she says, &quot;it&#x27;s exactly what is happening now.&quot; Both Sinha and Mack note that the past cannot just be grafted onto the present. But it&#x27;s important to understand how racism and white supremacy have always been at the center of threats to our democracy. &quot;If you talk to scholars of race, that&#x27;s the kind of perspective that you get,&quot; Mack says. Mack says he is glad the president is meeting with scholars to talk about the lessons of history. &quot;The group that Biden had in was a very distinguished group,&quot; he says.&quot;But the real question is, are there other people who would add to that discussion and enrich it and bring something that the people who were invited didn&#x27;t bring?Erica Loewe, White House Director of African American Media, told NPR in a statement: &quot;Since day one, President Biden has regularly engaged with diverse stakeholders and community leaders who offer different perspectives on a variety of issues. As a result, he has consistently taken action to ensure personnel and policy decisions reflect the diversity of this nation.&quot;Whose history is being centered? We can not know exactly what the historians said to President Biden, or whether they talked at any length about reconstruction and the death of democracy. But two of the historians appeared on TV afterword to talk about the meeting. Both Princeton Professor Sean Wilentz and Presidential historian Michael Beschloss confirmed and reiterated the Post&#x27;s reporting on the two key moments in American history they picked to focus on — the lead up to the Civil War and the 1930&#x27;s and 1940&#x27;s. Beschloss talked to MSNBC&#x27;s Jonathan Capeheart. &quot;If we were living in 1940,&quot; he said to Capeheart, who it&#x27;s important to note, is a Black man, &quot;you and I would&#x27;ve said there&#x27;s a serious danger that America will not be a democracy.&quot;The &quot;we&quot; is telling; America at that time was already not a democracy for most Black people. Beschloss went on, saying, &quot;There are people from within who wanna make this an authoritarian system.&quot; He didn&#x27;t mention that in the 1940&#x27;s many Black people already lived under authoritarian systems, like Jim Crow. Beschloss pointed to a second reason that democracy felt perilous then, as it does now. &quot;The Nazi Germans, the Italians, the Imperial Japanese — we&#x27;re living in a world where fascism is on the March,&quot; he said. But those rising fascist movements abroad borrowed heavily from America&#x27;s fascist tactics, from Jim Crow and America&#x27;s brutal treatment of Indigenous people. &quot;A global thing,&quot; says Manisha Sinha, &quot;but homegrown in the United States.&quot; Wilentz also didn&#x27;t mention race and American history when he spoke with CNN. What he did say was the moments where democracy is at risk all have something in common — a crisis of legitimacy. &quot;The key to all of this is when the basic institutions of the country are being called into — the legitimacy of those institutions is being called into serious question,&quot; he told CNN&#x27;s Michael Smerconish. &quot;That certainly happened before the Civil War and led to secession. The slaveholders&#x27; rebellion in which they said, look, we don&#x27;t believe in your constitution. Your constitution is wrong.&quot; That was a moment when Southern whites rejected and questioned the legitimacy of the federal government. But across American history Black people and people of color have had a justified, deep distrust of American institutions. Whose distrust and rejection of American institutions is Wilentz placing at the center of the story? Wilentz has a history of getting race and racism wrong, says Jelani Cobb. He points to an infamous piece, entitled &quot;Race Man,&quot; that Wilentz wrote in 2008. &quot;Sean Wilentz said that Barack Obama had run the most racist campaign in modern American history,&quot; Cobb says. In the essay, Wilentz accused the Obama campaign of &quot;the most outrageous deployment of racial politics since the Willie Horton campaign ad in 1988 and the most insidious since Ronald Reagan kicked off his 1980 campaign in Philadephia, Mississippi, praising states&#x27; rights.&quot; That announcement, just miles from where 3 civil rights workers were murdered by the KKK, was seen as a tacit nod by Reagan to white supremacists. &quot;Here we have this crisis which is shot through with racial elements and that&#x27;s the person in the room,&quot; Cobb says. &quot;Yeah. That&#x27;s a problem.&quot;In the room where it happensScott Kurashige, executive director of the American Studies Association, says to really understand the past, and its role in the present, we must look to historians who study more than just those in power. There is value to the presidential historian who reads every scrap of paper a president wrote, he says. &quot;But if that&#x27;s not paired with someone who&#x27;s analyzed the labor movement, the civil rights movement, the Black freedom movement, the movement of Japanese Americans for redress against incarceration,&quot; you don&#x27;t have the full story.It&#x27;s not enough to understand democracy is at risk, without learning from those who have borne — and still bear — the brunt of its loss. &quot;The people who&#x27;ve studied exclusion and people who&#x27;ve studied the struggle for civil rights and democracy for oppressed peoples have the biggest insights into how fragile democracy can be,&quot; he says.  They also have insight into something else, &quot;What it takes to build a movement — what type of struggle, what type of sacrifice, what type of courage and determination it takes to obtain, and preserve democracy.&quot; Because if we have ample examples in our historical DNA for the death of democracy, we also have a blueprint for its protection, and rebirth. There were abolitionists who fought against the horrors of slavery in America. Then, after the failures of reconstruction and the imposition of a brutal system of Jim Crow, came the long fight for Civil Rights. &quot;It took lots of people, activists on the ground, working daily to reintroduce democracy in those parts of the United States where it had been taken away,&quot; historian Kenneth Mack says. &quot;And it was only reintroduced within my lifetime.&quot; The 1960&#x27;s struggle for equal rights was a massive movement led by Black people and people of color — people who maintained a stubborn belief in America&#x27;s promise as they pushed for a second attempt at reconstruction. &quot;I think it&#x27;s really important for us to remember that even as ordinary American citizens, you can actually push the pendulum of history,&quot; says historian Manisha Sinha. People must push, Sinha says, but those in power must act. &quot;The only time American democracy has been protected has been when the federal government has responded in forceful ways,&quot; she says. The August historians meeting was not the only time President Biden hosted experts to learn from the past. Earlier this year he met with another group that included Annette Gordon-Reed, a Black scholar who studies race, law and history at Harvard. In previous speeches, Biden has compared today&#x27;s threats to voting rights to Reconstruction and post-Reconstruction America. But Jelani Cobb says it&#x27;s still concerning that this meeting of all white historians happened at all. Especially at the same time that there is a movement by Republican politicians to sensor and silence the histories of Black people and people of color across the United States. The campaign to outlaw the teaching of America&#x27;s racist — and anti-democratic — past is not a coincidence, says Cobb. The same politicians who are pushing history into the shadows, are also pushing and promoting voter suppression laws pulled directly from that past. &quot;What they are doing is effectively turning off the light switch,&quot; at the moment we most need to be able to see, Cobb says. History after all, can be read like a map. &quot;There&#x27;s a map that will help us understand the moment we&#x27;re in, and we are plunging ourselves into complete darkness at that moment.&quot; Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "Catholic health care systems can limit access to birth control.Rich Pedroncelli/APLast week, students returning to campus at Oberlin College in Ohio got a shock: A local news outlet reported that the campus&#x27; student health services  would severely limit who could get contraception prescriptions. They would only be given to treat health problems — not for the purpose of preventing pregnancy — and emergency contraception would only be available to victims of sexual assault. It turned out the college had outsourced its student health services to a Catholic health agency – and like other Catholic health institutions, it follows religious directives that prohibit contraception to prevent pregnancy. They also prohibit gender-affirming care.&quot;I would characterize the student&#x27;s reaction as outrage,&quot; says Remsen Welsh, a fourth-year Oberlin student and co-director of the student-run Sexual Information Center on campus. &quot;A lot of people in my circles were sending [the news story] around like, what is happening?&quot;Although the college quickly came up with a new plan to offer reproductive health services to students on campus, the incident at Oberlin shows the wide reach of Catholic health care in the U.S., and how the rules these institutions follow can limit access to contraception.Now that many states – including Ohio – have adopted restrictions or outright bans on abortion, that&#x27;s also raised the stakes for contraception access.Religious restrictions affect many health care settingsIssued by the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops, the Ethical and Religious Directives that guide Catholic health care systems &quot;prohibit a broad swath of reproductive care,&quot; including birth control pills, IUDs, tubal ligation and vasectomies, says Dr. Debra Stulberg, a professor of family medicine at the University of Chicago who has researched how these directives play out in health care. Catholic hospitals have long been a mainstay of health care in America. And these days, the directives apply to a wide range of settings where people seek reproductive health care – including urgent care centers, doctors&#x27; offices and outpatient surgery centers that have been bought by or merged with Catholic health systems. They can also apply when Catholic health agencies are hired to manage health care services for other institutions, which is what happened at Oberlin. Four of the 10 largest health care systems in the country are Catholic, according to a 2020 report. In some counties, they dominate the market. In 52 communities, the report found, a Catholic hospital is the only one around within a 45-minute drive.&quot;After all this consolidation, this is where it shakes out, where we&#x27;ve got about 40% of reproductive age women living in areas with high or dominant Catholic hospital market share,&quot; says Marian Jarlenski, a health policy researcher at the University of Pittsburgh, who examined the data in 2020.&#x27;Not transparent at all&#x27;Patients often aren&#x27;t aware that these restrictions might affect the care they get, says Lois Uttley, a senior advisor with the health advocacy group Community Catalyst. They may not realize their hospital or doctor&#x27;s office has Catholic ties. For instance, Common Spirit Health, one of the nation&#x27;s biggest health systems, is Catholic, but you wouldn&#x27;t know it from its name. And Uttley says Catholic health institutions typically don&#x27;t publicize these policies.&quot;They are not open and transparent about it at all,&quot; Uttley says. &quot;We think it&#x27;s only fair that a patient be warned ahead of time about what she may or may not be able to get at a local doctor&#x27;s office or urgent care center or hospital.&quot; In a campus bulletin posted on Tuesday, Oberlin&#x27;s president, Carmen Twillie Ambar, said Oberlin had only recently learned that these restrictions would be enforced by Bon Secours, the large Catholic health system whose subsidiary was hired to run the college&#x27;s health services. Bon Secours told the local Chronicle-Telegram that it would only offer birth control prescriptions for medical reasons – an exception allowed under the religious directives. Carmen Twillie Ambar, president of Oberlin College, said Oberlin had only recently learned that contraception restrictions would be enforced by the Catholic health system whose subsidiary was hired to run the college&#x27;s health services. Earlier in August, she joined a meeting with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and other university and college presidents on access to reproductive health care.Samuel Corum/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesWhen workarounds are all you&#x27;ve gotIn practice, many doctors who work for Catholic-owned or affiliated health providers routinely rely on &quot;medical condition&quot; exceptions as a way to get around religious restrictions on contraception, Stulberg&#x27;s research has found. For example, hormonal IUDs can be used to control heavy menstrual bleedings, so doctors will often say they&#x27;re providing the IUD to treat this condition, even if the real goal is contraception.Or doctors who aren&#x27;t allowed to perform a tubal ligation might instead remove the tubes altogether — they&#x27;ll just say it&#x27;s to lower a patient&#x27;s risk of ovarian cancer. Dr. Corinne McLeod, an OB/GYN at Albany Medical Center, says these kinds of workarounds were pretty common when she worked at a Catholic hospital in Albany, N.Y.&quot;That was basically a wink, wink, nudge, nudge,&quot; McLeod says, adding, &quot;Everybody knew what was happening. That was just the way they got around  [restrictions].&quot; One problem with relying on such loopholes, she says, is that if religious higher-ups at institutions get wind of it, they might crack down. In other cases, workarounds might include creating a separately funded and run wing within a Catholic hospital or health clinic to provide the full range of reproductive health services. That&#x27;s essentially what happened at Oberlin: The college partnered with a local family planning clinic to offer these services on campus three days a week, and said it would provide students with transportation to the clinic on other days. But the Catholic health provider will continue to offer other health services on campus. Tiffany Yuen, a fourth-year Oberlin student who runs the Sexual Information Center with Welsh, said the solution was &quot;a start. But it&#x27;s not enough.&quot; In the past, about 40% of visits to the student health center were related to sexual health, according to Aimee Holmes, a certified nurse midwife who worked as a women&#x27;s health specialist at Oberlin for many years until Bon Secours&#x27; subsidiary took over.Students at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, were outraged to hear that the student health center would be limiting who can get contraception after a Catholic health system took over student health services.Tony Dejak/AP&#x27;In some cases, women truly have no other choices&#x27;Research suggests that even with workarounds, Catholic directives can limit women&#x27;s contraception choices. For example, one study found that while it was pretty easy for patients to book an appointment for hormonal birth control at clinics owned by Catholic hospitals, it was rarer to get one if you wanted a copper IUD, which is one of the most effective forms of long-acting reversible contraception. I personally ran into these limitations eight years ago, when I gave birth to my second child. When I asked my doctor for a tubal ligation once I was on the delivery table, he informed me he couldn&#x27;t do the procedure because we were at a Catholic hospital. A recent study suggests this experience is common: It found that women who deliver at a Catholic hospital are half as likely to get tubal ligation or removal as those who deliver at another type of hospital.Stulberg has conducted surveys that find many people don&#x27;t realize their choices will be limited because they don&#x27;t know their health provider is governed by these rules. &quot;And of the people that had some kind of a reproductive health refusal, the majority, it wasn&#x27;t until either they were there or afterwards that they found out that they couldn&#x27;t get what they wanted,&quot; she says.In some cases, patients may simply be able to go to another health provider to get the contraception they need – but not always. &quot;In some cases, women truly have no other choices,&quot; Stulberg says. &quot;This hospital or this system is the only provider in town.&quot; She says a patient&#x27;s options may also be constrained depending on their health insurance and whether the providers covered under the plan are subject to religious directives. Several experts said that these restrictions can often impact low-income patients disproportionately. Dr. Karishma Dara, a family medicine doctor in Seattle, says that when she worked as a resident at a Catholic hospital in Washington, D.C., that served many low-income people, patients who came in for IUD appointments were told they had to go to a different, non-Catholic clinic to get the devices inserted.&quot;Any time that you have to add another step to getting care or contraceptive care, it&#x27;s like another point at which an unintended pregnancy can happen,&quot; Dara says.In fact, Catholic directives can limit access to contraception long after a health care facility stops being Catholic, says Elizabeth Sepper, an expert on religious liberty and health law at the University of Texas at Austin. &quot;There are lots of examples where a Catholic health system has purchased a hospital, just held it for a handful of years and then sold the hospital,&quot; she says. &quot;But the purchase agreement then commits the next owner to continue the Catholic religious restrictions.&quot; Reproductive rights advocates want to see laws that require hospital systems to be more transparent about what health services they do and don&#x27;t offer. Legislators in New York have introduced such a law.&quot;You know, I&#x27;m not against Catholic health care, but I think that patients need to know what kind of services are available to them,&quot; says Jarlenski.

Wade, which allowed state governments to decide whether to permit abortions.Since then, a number of states have implemented full bans on the procedure or drastically limited it.Now, the VA says it&#x27;s stepping in to offer abortions in order to protect the health and lives of veterans in places where they can no longer access such reproductive care.Under a new interim final rule, pregnant veterans and VA beneficiaries will be able to get abortions if their life or health would be in danger if the pregnancy went to term. Patients whose pregnancies were the result of rape or incest will also be eligible for abortions.The department said it would prepare to offer the services in as many places as possible as soon as the rule is published.&quot;We came to this decision after listening to VA health care providers and Veterans across the country, who sounded the alarm that abortion restrictions are creating a medical emergency for those we serve,&quot; Dr. Shereef Elnahal, the VA&#x27;s undersecretary for health, said in a statement.&quot;Offering this care will save Veterans&#x27; health and lives, and there is nothing more important than that,&quot; he added.The department said determinations of whether a pregnant person&#x27;s life or health was in danger would be made on a case-by-case basis and involve consultation between VA health care providers and patients.The department says its employees are able to avoid state restrictions &quot;when working within the scope of their federal employment.&quot; Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "Former President Donald Trump speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas on Aug. 6.Brandon Bell/Getty ImagesMost elections are, at least in part, reactions to the results of the last election. Usually, that means they function as a referendum on the last election&#x27;s winners and their performance in office.It is unusual, if not unprecedented, for the midterm cycle to focus on the conduct of the last election — a kind of referendum on the legitimacy of the system itself.By that standard, 2022 qualifies as unusual indeed.Donald Trump and his followers, who now represent the activist core of the Republican Party, have insisted on making 2022 a do-over of 2020. Their essential argument is not that President Biden has failed or been a bad president, but that he was never legitimately elected president in the first place.Trump has in fact this past week demanded he be &quot;reinstated&quot; as the &quot;rightful winner&quot; of the 2020 election or that the election be re-run &quot;immediately&quot; because Facebook had been advised by the FBI not to trust certain stories about Biden&#x27;s son, Hunter, during the 2020 campaign.Trump continues to insist, after 20 months, that he won an election that he lost by more than 7 million in the popular vote and by 306-232 in the Electoral College. Neither he nor his acolytes have produced any evidence to undermine those totals. But they have eroded confidence in the system and its caretakers to the degree that a majority of Republicans tell pollsters they think the election was &quot;stolen.&quot;The rest of the GOP, including prominent leaders such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, would clearly prefer to talk about Biden and about inflation, gas prices, crime and immigration. But they cannot wrest the party&#x27;s megaphone back from the man who has monopolized it since 2015. And whatever they think of Trump personally, they are as reliant as he is on the support and donations and votes of his followers. So they fall in line, or they fall silent.The rise of election denial in the GOPMoreover, a new generation of candidates has emerged and surged in GOP primaries by stressing their embrace of Trump&#x27;s claims.Trump has endorsed 159 candidates who are election deniers for state and federal offices this year, and about 80% of them have already won their Republican primaries, according to a survey by The New York Times. A separate survey by The Washington Post found 87 election deniers among candidates for offices that will matter to the vote certification of the next election in six battleground states he narrowly lost in 2020 (Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin). Of that number, 54 have already won their primaries.&quot;The 2020 election was stolen,&quot; say the MAGA candidates who wear Trump&#x27;s favor, adding, &quot;You know it and I know it.&quot; That statement of assurance is usually the only proof offered. And the crowd at the rally roars back its affirmation.The &quot;you know it and I know it&quot; mantra is also available in a variety of display formats. You can go on Amazon today and order it on a package of 10 waterproof vinyl car decals, or go elsewhere for it on a doormat or on a polyester flag measuring 15 square feet.From the standpoint of a fact-checker, there is no evidence of fraud sufficient to support that claim. After nearly two years of recounts, ballot reviews, expert examinations and court cases, that remains the bottom line. The 2020 election has been scrubbed and studied as none other in U.S. history, and the consensus conclusion remains that it was run more smoothly and counted more reliably than ever.So why do Trump&#x27;s people continue to deny the outcomes, and why do crowds cheer?Perhaps, because in politics, myth can be as powerful as fact — and at times it may well be more so.Claims of voter fraud have become integral to Trump&#x27;s brand. But he did not invent the idea of a stolen election. He exploited it as no one had before, to be sure, but he was mining a lode that had been opened long ago and tapped as a rich source of grievance for generations.Deep and tenacious rootsFor the &quot;election deniers,&quot; and for many Americans who accept the 2020 results but still think voter fraud is a big problem, the roots of these beliefs are deep.The Heritage Foundation, long an anchor on the right among think tanks in Washington, devotes a page of its website to voter fraud and offers a database of cases. It also offers a disquisition on ballot stuffing and voter intimidation and other forms of malfeasance common in the 1700s and 1800s and early 1900s.The prime example cited by Heritage is an election stolen by the notorious Democratic machine in New York City known as Tammany Hall. It happened in 1844. More recent examples cited include a mayoral primary in East Chicago, Ind., in 2003.The figure of 1,182 is cited for the total of criminal prosecutions for voter fraud in recent years, most of them dealing with improper registration or fraudulent use of absentee ballots. They are listed as 2022 cases, but on further inspection they date back over a period of years and arise from primaries as well as general elections. The database does not mention that in 2020 alone there were more than 50 million votes cast in primaries and more than 158 million in the November election.William Safire was a White House speechwriter for President Richard Nixon who later spent decades writing columns on politics and language for The New York Times. In his popular New Political Dictionary, he wrote extensively on &quot;ballot box stuffing&quot; and &quot;cemetery voting.&quot; He, too, went back to Tammany Hall rigging outcomes for the Democrats in New York City in the 1800s, while also allowing that the Republican strongholds in upstate New York were often suspect in their reporting as late as the 1920s.Safire noted that many had believed the 1960 presidential election was tipped to John F. Kennedy and running mate Lyndon B. Johnson by vote theft in rural Texas counties and the heavily Catholic precincts of Chicago, where the Democratic machine of Mayor Richard J. Daley held sway. One story often repeated among Protestant Republicans in Illinois described school buses shuttling nuns around the city on Election Day, unloading them to vote at every Catholic parish they passed.Still, in Safire&#x27;s treatment, these phenomena were historical artifacts of an era before mechanized and later digitized voting became the norm and cheating became more challenging. The Florida vote counting fiasco in 2000, which struggled for weeks to ascertain a reliable result, ended the era of complacency on this score. In the end, the Supreme Court upheld a count by which George W. Bush won the state by just over 500 votes, thus securing Florida&#x27;s crucial contribution to his minimum-margin win in the Electoral College.Since then, the administration of U.S. elections has been thoroughly examined and renovated. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) devoted billions to upgrading the election infrastructure, and many states instituted reforms of their own to facilitate and improve their voting and counting systems.At the same time, the Bush White House was directing the Department of Justice to investigate thoroughly the possibility that voter fraud in major cities was padding the Democratic vote in swing states. The probe began in 2002 and five years later had little to show for its work. The federal Election Assistance Commission, tasked with finding fraud, reported that while some abuses had occurred, they were far from systematic or pervasive enough to matter much.Nevertheless, the search went on and some U.S. attorneys around the country felt they were being pressured to prioritize prosecutions for voter fraud. Several resigned, and the allegations became part of the investigation Democrats began into the department after taking the majority in Congress in 2006. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, appointed by Bush in 2005, resigned in 2007.Trump brings the issue back to the foreTalk of voter fraud simmered down a bit thereafter. But the issue returned to prominence when Trump, after years of pumping up the &quot;birther&quot; conspiracy about Barack Obama&#x27;s citizenship, shifted his focus to voter fraud in 2016. The only way he could lose, he said often that year, was if the election were stolen.When he won that year, Trump still leveled angry allegations of voter fraud, perhaps because he had lost the national popular vote by nearly 3 million. He said between 3 million and 5 million non-citizens had voted in California alone, but he offered no proof whatsoever. He then appointed a bipartisan commission to find the proof, not just in California, but nationwide.The commission was soon identified with the aggressive tactics of its vice chairman, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who had sent requests around the country for extensive voter data. Many states, both red and blue, resisted or flat out refused. Dissension broke out within the commission, which disbanded after seven months without having found any evidence of voter fraud.Nonetheless, Trump was back in the 2020 cycle predicting he could only lose if there was fraud, and that stance once again segued into a fury of denial and denunciations when he lost. While he struck out in the courts at the state and federal level (the Supreme Court refused to hear any of the appeals), Trump took his case to the public and has had considerable success in sowing doubt among his sympathizers.At least one of the other Republicans eyeing the 2024 presidential election cycle, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, has also made voter fraud a signature issue. In August, he held a news conference at which he announced the filing of charges against 20 Floridians who he said had voted illegally in 2020.With rows of his &quot;election police&quot; posed behind him, DeSantis said he was outing ex-offenders who had no right to vote because of the seriousness of their crimes. It was later reported that at least some of the ex-offenders had believed their rights had been restored by a referendum Florida voters had approved by a big margin in 2018. Getting stronger still?Ricky Hatch is a Republican in Weber County, Utah, who has been an election official there since 2012. He is among several local election administrators from around the country who appear in a forthcoming book by CBS News reporter Major Garrett and David Becker, a previous longtime elections lawyer with the Department of Justice who founded the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research. In The Big Truth: Upholding Democracy in the Age of &quot;The Big Lie,&quot; Garrett and Becker detail the travails of the ordinary citizens on the front lines of the voting struggle.Hatch said some of his neighbors cannot be persuaded even when he personally demonstrates to them how all the machinery of the process works right there in their home county. &quot;They say, &#x27;I know your machines have been hacked by China,&#x27; &quot; Hatch reports. &quot;I show them there is no means to hack the machines, that nothing is connected. They just say, &#x27;They have been hacked, you just don&#x27;t know it.&#x27; &quot;Hatch says he has heard objections from skeptics over the years, but nothing like the wall of denialism erected by Trump.&quot;I hate saying this, but he has the same characteristics as a cult leader,&quot; Hatch says. &quot;He pulls people into a belief system. I thought it would die down. ... It&#x27;s getting stronger.&quot;At a minimum, the issue of voter fraud seems undiminished in its ability to galvanize certain categories of voters and create doubt about the outcome of elections.Perhaps that should not be surprising. Voter fraud exists, but its prevalence and importance are less a matter of fact than of belief. Relying on that belief to explain away unpalatable election results is an exercise of faith, but one that millions find more acceptable than all the arguments and evidence from experts, courts and academics.In the end, articles of faith are just that. Whether you consider faith to be higher than reason or simply unreasonable, such beliefs can be largely immune to factual refutation or rational argument. And they can be powerful motivators of human behavior, including at the polls.   Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "Physician Assistant Susan Eng-Na, right, administers a monkeypox vaccine during a vaccination clinic in New York. New cases are starting to decline in New York and some other U.S. cities.Mary Altaffer/APUpdated September 2, 2022 at 6:23 PM ETMore than three months into the U.S. monkeypox outbreak, there&#x27;s a welcome  phrase coming from the lips of health officials who are steering the country&#x27;s response: cautious optimism. The change in tone reflects &quot;recent signs the rate of growth is slowing,&quot; according to a CDC technical report released Thursday. These signs are especially apparent in some of the major cities where the virus arrived early and spread quickly, such as New York City, Chicago, and San Francisco. Federal officials warn it&#x27;s still too soon to make pronouncements about the country turning a corner.  And they&#x27;re ramping up a monkeypox vaccination campaign – sending thousands of vaccine doses this Labor Day Weekend to events like Southern Decadence in New Orleans, Atlanta Black Pride and Pridefest in Oakland, to reach large gatherings of gay, bisexual and queer people – especially men who have sex with men – who are at higher risk of getting exposed to and infected by the virus. Still the slowdown in some parts of the U.S. – coupled with data about how those at highest risk are protecting themselves and getting vaccinated – are promising signs. &quot;Our numbers are still increasing, [but] the rate of rise is lower,&quot; Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters on August 26. &quot;We&#x27;re really hopeful that many of our harm reduction messages and our vaccines are getting out there and working.&quot;Reported case numbers have been trending down since mid August, based on an NPR analysis of data the CDC released Wednesday. Overall, there&#x27;s been around a 20% drop in the 7-day average of new cases from August 10 through August 26, and new case counts in recent days continue to decrease .However, health officials caution that lags in data reporting can offer an incomplete picture of the outbreak in recent weeks, making it hard to know if cases have truly peaked.  And notes Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at UCLA who has studied monkeypox for years, cases could increase again, if providers and patients at risk let down their guard and stop testing or taking mitigating behaviors. &quot;We need to be watching the data carefully and continuing to push forward to increase testing, increase access to care and ensure that everybody that is at risk has access to vaccines,&quot; she says. Cases slow down in big citiesIn New York City – one of the epicenters of the outbreak – the number of new people being infected has dropped almost 50% from late July through late August . San Francisco health officials are also seeing a decline in the rate of new cases.  &quot;I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic,&quot; says Dr. Susan Philip, health officer for the city and county of San Francisco. &quot;We know, though, it&#x27;s going to take a lot of work and effort to sustain that downward curve and to make sure that cases continue to go down.&quot; The picture is also improving in other cities like Houston and Chicago where local health leaders say there are indications that infections are leveling off.Key metrics – such as the average number of cases and the time it takes for cases to double – have decreased over the past couple of weeks, says Janna Kerins, medical director at the Chicago Department of Public Health. &quot;I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re ready to say this outbreak is truly ending,&quot; Kerins says, &quot;But all of those things are encouraging.&quot;The changes also track with modeling released in late August that suggests the national outbreak is on the decline. &quot;We are seeing signs of a substantial slowdown and the forecasts suggest that this is going to go in the right direction,&quot; at least over the next four weeks, says Gerardo Chowell-Puente, professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the Georgia State University, who&#x27;s modeling the monkeypox outbreak.CDC projections concur, estimating &quot;the monkeypox outbreak in the United States will likely continue to grow very slowly over the next two to four weeks, likely with a declining growth rate,&quot; agency staff wrote in a technical report released Thursday.  The decline in parts of the U.S. mirrors what&#x27;s already being seen in some European countries, where the virus was detected a few weeks earlier. In both the U.K. and Germany, daily case counts have steadily dropped since late July. In several other countries, including the Netherlands and Italy, the number of new cases have plateaued. Behavior change is helpingGiven the size and diversity of the U.S., there&#x27;s still considerable uncertainty on how the outbreak will play out in different parts of the country, notes Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. &quot;Case counts in large, populous states like Texas, California, and New York that were hit early in the epidemic are slowing just as other states like Oregon, Virginia, and Indiana begin to pick up steam,&quot; she wrote in a Substack post Friday.  Still, infectious disease experts largely attribute the local and regional slowdowns to efforts in those areas to change behavior among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men – a group that accounts for the vast majority of cases. &quot;Most of us in public health who work on this disease are quite confident that the majority of the reduction is due to change in behavior,&quot; says Dr. Jay Varma, director of the Cornell Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response at Weill Cornell Medicine.Currently around 80% of monkeypox cases in the U.S. are associated with sexual activity, according to the Thursday&#x27;s technical report. And data, published in the CDC&#x27;s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly on August 26, show that gay and queer communities are modifying their sexual behaviors in response to messaging around monkeypox. In one online survey, about 50% of respondents said they had reduced &quot;their number of sexual partners, one-time sexual encounters [or] use of dating apps because of the monkeypox outbreak.&quot; An accompanying modeling study released by the CDC showed that a &quot;40% reduction in one-time sexual partnership might delay the spread of monkeypox and reduce the percentage of people infected&quot; by up to about 30%. &quot;What this means is that the LGBTQIA+ people are doing things that are actually reducing their risk, and it&#x27;s working,&quot; said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, White House monkeypox response deputy coordinator, at a press briefing August 26. It&#x27;s not entirely surprising that the virus appears to be slowing down in the U.S. as it has in Europe, says Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases, population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. &quot;Most of the cities will see a decline in cases – that decline may not be as fast or as steep as the ascent,&quot; says Klausner. Klausner notes that monkeypox has stayed mostly within certain relatively small sexual networks – that makes it harder for the virus to maintain momentum as vaccination increases, people build up immunity from infection and those at highest risk change their behavior. &quot;People who raised concerns about the spread of infection on college campuses and daycares and other kinds of settings where there&#x27;s close personal contact, at this point, that hasn&#x27;t occurred,&quot; he says.Uncertainty remains But other experts are not as sanguine about the trajectory of the outbreak – at least not yet. &quot;It&#x27;s great to see some declines,&quot; UCLA&#x27;s Rimoin. &quot;But if the downward trend is due to changes in behavior and vaccinations, it&#x27;s not clear how long behavioral changes can be sustained, and how well the vaccinations actually work to prevent infections.&quot;Health officials are urging members of affected communities to keep taking precautions – with an emphasis on reducing the number of sexual partners and remaining clothed at parties, festivals and raves – to slow the spread of monkeypox. &quot;Let me be clear,&quot; Daskalakis said August 26. &quot;The advice about how to reduce risk for monkeypox exposure is for now, not forever, and is an important part of our public health and community response as we urgently surge vaccinations to control this outbreak.&quot;Around 350,000 monkeypox vaccine doses have been reported as administered to CDC. Still, there isn&#x27;t robust real world data on how well the monkeypox vaccine – approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2019 – protects against infection and transmission. Further complicating the picture is that a shortage of vaccine has led the Biden administration to pursue a new strategy of offering the shots intradermally in order to stretch the supply. &quot;The laboratory data that we have on the vaccine suggests that it&#x27;s going to be very effective in humans,&quot; says Varma. &quot;But what we know in medicine is that until we see what happens in the real world, we never know for sure.&quot;  NPR&#x27;s Michaeleen Doucleff contributed to this report.

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/tigers-designate-michael-pineda-for-assignment.html",
        "description": "The Tigers have designated right-hander Michael Pineda for assignment, Cody Stavenhagen of The Athletic was among those to report. His roster spot will go to reliever Luis Castillo.\nPineda, 33, is a veteran who made his MLB debut with the Mariners back in 2011 and has since pitched for the Yankees and Twins. He joined the Tigers for this season on a one-year deal that came with a $5.5MM guarantee as well as incentives based on innings pitched.\nAt the time, it was surely hoped that Pineda could be a reliable veteran presence in a rotation that featured a lot of talented but inexperienced youngsters. In the end, just about every pitcher who started a game for the Tigers spent some time on the injured list this year, with Pineda being no exception. He went to the IL in May due to a right middle finger fracture, costing him about six weeks. In late July, he returned to the IL due to right triceps tightness, which kept him away for another five weeks.\nBetween those IL stints, he&#8217;s only been able to make 11 starts and throw 46 2/3 innings. He also hasn&#8217;t been able to be very effective, with his 5.79 ERA almost a full run above his previous career high of 4.82. His 13% strikeout rate is easily the worst of his career, though his control is still present, with his 4% walk rate about half of the league average for starters.\nThe Tigers are well out of contention and will use the final weeks of the season to audition youngsters for roles on future teams. &#8220;I hate it for Michael,&#8221; manager A.J. Hinch tells Stavenhagen. &#8220;Nothing worse than telling a veteran of his magnitude and his career that we’re moving on from him. But for us, it’s time to take a look at the guys who have a better chance of being here.&#8221;\nThere might also be a financial reason for the move, as Pineda was about to start hitting the incentives in his contract. He would have received $375K for hitting each of the 50, 75, 100, and 125 inning benchmarks, and he would receive an additional $500K for tossing 150 and 175 innings. Since he&#8217;s currently at 46 2/3 frames on the year, he likely would have earned himself an extra $375K in his next start. Instead, he will be put on waivers in the coming days, likely clearing waivers given the approximately $800K remaining on his deal. Assuming he does clear, he would be able to reject an outright assignment in favor of electing free agency, by virtue of having more than five years of MLB service time.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/andrew-benintendi-to-undergo-hamate-surgery.html",
        "description": "Yankees outfielder Andrew Benintendi broke the hook of his hamate bone and will require surgery, manager Aaron Boone tells Bryan Hoch of MLB.com. Benintendi is already on the 10-day injured list, having been placed there yesterday.\nThe club has not yet provided an estimated timeline for Benintendi&#8217;s recovery process, but it&#8217;s bound to be significant regardless given the time of year. There are just over four weeks remaining in the regular season schedule, which doesn&#8217;t leave much time for the outfielder to go through the process of recovering from the procedure and getting back into game shape. Despite their recent slump, the Yankees are still in a strong position to both make the playoffs and get a bye past the first round, as they are five games up on the Rays and 10 1/2 clear of the Central-leading Guardians. That would give Benintendi more time to return, especially if the Yankees can win a playoff round or two, but it&#8217;s still unclear if that&#8217;s in the cards. Hoch relays word from Benintendi himself, who says he&#8217;s still going to speak with some specialists but believes he could return before the end of the regular season.\nAcquired from the Royals just prior to the deadline, Benintendi has hit .302/.371/.397 on the year between the two teams. That offensive production is 22% better than the league average hitter this year, as evidenced by his 122 wRC+. That solid campaign was put on hold Friday night, when Benintendi left in obvious pain after hurting himself on a swing.\nIn the past couple of games without Benintendi, the Yanks have used an outfield of Aaron Judge, Oswaldo Cabrera and Aaron Hicks, with other options like Estevan Florial, Marwin Gonzalez and Tim Locastro on the bench. Harrison Bader and Matt Carpenter could join the club down the line, but neither are especially close. Bader, acquired from the Cardinals at the trade deadline, is ramping up towards a rehab assignment. Carpenter went on the IL a few weeks ago with a fractured foot and still hopes to return at some point. But in the short term, the in-house options will probably have to do.\nThe Yankees seemed to be walking away with the AL East for much of the year, leading by as much as 15 1/2 games in July. A poor showing in recent weeks dropped their lead as low as four games coming into today, though they defeated the Rays to stretch it back out to five. That means the final weeks of the season are going to be much more important than it may have seemed not too long ago.",

        "description": "Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Matt Manning wasn’t at his best, but it was the bullpen and repeated failures at the plate that blew it in the end. Matt Manning wasn’t at his best on a drizzly Sunday afternoon in the Motor City, but it was Gregory Soto’s late-game mistakes that cost the Detroit Tigers the game and series against the Kansas City Royals. The Tigers fell, 3-2, after keeping things tied for most of the afternoon.\nManning had a long first inning, despite allowing just one baserunner. Tucker Barnhart and Javier Báez connected to catch Bobby Witt Jr. stealing, but Nick Pratto’s nine-pitch at-bat still dragged Manning past the 20-pitch mark. The Tigers stranded Báez in the bottom half of the inning after a two-out infield single.\n\n\nTrying to steal 2nd base with @Tucker_Barnhart behind home plate? Not the best idea. #DetroitRoots pic.twitter.com/MXvY6IhCJv— Bally Sports Detroit (@BallySportsDET) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nMichael Taylor hit a leadoff double to start the second, but Manning worked his way out of the inning with a pair of fly balls and a strikeout — Haase struck out on three pitches, Jeimer Candelario grounded out in a decent at-bat and Ryan Kreidler K’d as well.\nThe Royals worked a two-out rally in the third for the first real threat of the game from either club. Witt laced a line drive into left to get things going and Jeimer Candelario extended the inning with a throwing error that put men on the corners. Manning struck out Pratto to get out of it, though.\nKansas City’s starter, Max Castillo, also ran into trouble in the third and got out of it, but the Tigers might have helped him out by not challenging a close play at second. Akil Baddoo seemed sure that he had evaded the tag sliding into the base, but Hinch opted not to challenge the play after talking to the replay team. Riley Greene extended his hit streak to 13-games immediately after that, but the ball probably wasn’t deep enough to score Baddoo even if they did overturn the call at second. \n\n\nJust before that Greene single, Akil Baddoo was caught stealing for the fourth time in eight tries. Pretty much a 50-50 ball every time he runs...ha. Math.— Chris McCosky (@cmccosky) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThe wheels came off for Manning in the fourth. He finished out the inning but still gave up two runs on two hits, two walks and a hit batter. He couldn’t command much and even walked in a run, but Manning kept the score within reason, which is more than he did against the Seattle Mariners in his last outing.\nBáez immediately responded with his second hit of the day to lead off the bottom half of the frame. As Gibby and Shep discussed whether Báez should steal or stay put at first, Harold Castro launched a ball into the right field stands for home run No. 6 of the year. Tie ball game. \n\n\nHittin Harold Castro puts the Tigers on the board and ties things up at two with a homer in the 4th, Dan Dickerson on the call #DetroitRoots pic.twitter.com/3Pxnkhmdwg— Dan Dickerson Calls  (@dannydHRs) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nCastillo locked back in and quickly struck out Haase for the second time. Candelario got frozen on a four-seamer that caught the top of the zone for strike three, and Kreidler couldn’t win an eight-pitch battle that ended in a fly out to center field.\nWill Vest took over for Manning and pitched the first 1-2-3 inning of the day for the Tigers. Manning has been decent since returning to the rotation, but today wasn’t his day. From the long first inning to walking in a run, he just didn’t seem to have it. It wasn’t as bad as his last outing against Seattle when he gave up seven earned runs in 2 1⁄3 innings, but Manning needs to figure out what’s wrong quickly.\nThe Tigers knocked out Castillo before he could get out of the fifth inning. Detroit didn’t really threaten, but his pitch count was climbing and Collin Snider was ready to come in. He needed just one pitch to retire Victor Reyes, but it took a web gem from Witt to get it done. The ball ricocheted off Snider’s foot into the air, and Witt caught it barehanded and then rocketed it over to first in time. \n\n\nBobby Witt Jr. barehand play! pic.twitter.com/1UIXiQzqp4— Talkin’ Baseball (@TalkinBaseball_) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nVest returned to the mound for Detroit in the sixth and got two quick outs before Nicky Lopez reached on a single. Alex Lange came in to close out the inning and struck out MJ Melendez to render Lopez’s steal of second moot.\nJose Cuas replaced Snider on the bump for Kansas City to start the bottom of the sixth. Haase took an ugly first hack and appeared destined for a third strikeout, but he turned on that very same pitch and drove it to left field for a double. Cuas intentionally walked Candelario to get to Kreidler, who struck out to end the threat.\nThe seventh inning got scary for Detroit. Joe Jimenez replaced Lange and struggled after getting the first two outs on five pitches. He walked Pratto and gave up the third hit of the day to Taylor, which was enough for Hinch to pull him from the game. Andrew Chafin came in to face lefty Michael Massey, but he brought it inside and plunked him to load the bases. Fortunately, Chafin recovered and got Hunter Dozier to fly out to center. Royals fans were less than pleased...\n\n\nHunter Dozier ABs pic.twitter.com/fHPHvgBJm8— Clubhouse Convo (@royalsclubhouse) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThere was potential for another entry in the ongoing saga between Báez and Royals’ reliever Amir Garrett in the bottom of the seventh, but the Mike Matheny pulled Garrett before he could get the chance. Miggy might be hurt, but he looked ready to throw hands for Javy if things went south. \nGarrett left a pair of baserunners on for Dylan Coleman, who stuck the tried-and-true method of throwing sliders to Báez and watching him whiff. It’s painfully predictable, and Báez can’t figure it out. Willi Castro entered the game as a pinch hitter for Baddoo and stayed in as the right fielder. Reyes shifted over to left to take over for Baddoo. \nGregory Soto took over for Detroit in the eighth and, somewhat predictably, gave up the lead. He gave up a double to Melendez that should have scored Nicky Lopez, but Reyes and Báez made a great relay play to get Lopez at home. \n\n\nSome spectacular teamwork by the @tigers prevents Kansas City from taking the lead here in the 8th! #DetroitRoots pic.twitter.com/cr6VxqPcfg— Bally Sports Detroit (@BallySportsDET) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nSoto would not be denied, though, and he promptly gave up a double to Witt on a ground ball right under Candelario’s glove, blowing the lead. He struck out Pratto after intentionally walking Salvador Perez, but the damage was done. Detroit now trailed, 3-2. Harold Castro led off the bottom of the eighth with a single, his second hit of the day, but Eric Haase grounded into a double play three pitches later. Candelario struck out for the second time, sending things to the ninth.\nJason Foley came out to pitch a 1-2-3 ninth for Detroit, but Riley Greene had to make another unbelievable catch to keep it intact. He slammed into the wall as he came down from a leaping catch in the deepest part of the ballpark, but he looked okay as he jogged back to the dugout. \n\n\nWhatever it takes, @Greene21Riley. pic.twitter.com/SkJem77LnT— Detroit Tigers (@tigers) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nKreidler tried to start a rally in the ninth, but Pratto laid out to stop a hard-hit ground ball from leaving the infield and tossed it to Scott Barlow, who came in to close things out. Barnhart struck out on a ball in the dirt for Detroit’s 10th K of the day and Willi Castro flied out to right, ending the ball game.\nAfter dropping five of the last six games in Detroit, the Tigers will head to Los Angeles for a three-game series against the Angels that starts tomorrow. Shohei Ohtani isn’t expected to pitch during the series. \nFollowing Sunday’s contest, the Tigers announced that veteran right-hander Michael Pineda has been DFA’d. Minor league reliever Luis Castillo will be called up to join the bullpen.\n\n\nTigers have DFA’d Michael Pineda.Luis Castillo will join the bullpen for the Anaheim series— Cody Stavenhagen (@CodyStavenhagen) September 4, 2022",

        "description": "Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Royals win their first series in almost a month. Bobby Witt Jr. had a pair of hits, including the game-winning double, to go with a dazzling defensive play in a 3-2 win over the Tigers on Sunday afternoon.\nThe Royals had a runner in scoring position in each of the first three frames but couldn’t cash any in for a run against Tigers starter Matt Manning. They finally broke through in the fourth with a pair of runs with a Nicky Lopez single with the bases loaded, followed by a bases-loaded walk to MJ Melendez to force home a run. \nMax Castillo pitched well, but he gave the lead right back up in the bottom of the inning. Javier Báez led off with a single and Harold Castro drilled a two-run home run to tie the game. Castillo would make it through 4 2⁄3 innings and 95 pitches allowing five hits and one walk with five strikeouts. \nThe Royals had an opportunity to take the lead in the seventh off reliever Andrew Chafin. With two outs, Nick Pratto walked and Michael Taylor singled. Chafin hit Michael Massey (oddly the second time Massey was hit today, and seventh time in the last 11 games) to load the bases. But Hunter Dozier flied out to end the threat.\nThe Royals did take the lead in the eighth off Tigers closer Gregory Soto. Nicky Lopez drew a one-out walk, and MJ Melendez followed with a double. But Lopez was out by a few feet at home plate trying to score on the play, the 20th time this year the Royals have made an out at home, tied for tops in baseball. Bobby Witt Jr. picked the team up with an RBI double to give them a 3-2 lead. Oh and he also made this play earlier in the game.\n\n\nOff the pitcher's foot, WAY into the air and still out at first? @BwittJr is special. pic.twitter.com/HlTiZUilil— MLB (@MLB) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nScott Barlow closed things out, giving Royals relievers a combined 4 1⁄3 scoreless innings of work. Witt finished with a pair of hits and leads all rookies and Royals hitters with 70 RBI. Royals hitters drew six walks and Royals pitchers issued just three free passes. The Royals win their first series since August 9-11 against the White Sox and improve to 55-80. They’ll head back home for a six-game homestand beginning tomorrow evening against the Cleveland Guardians.",

He claims to the group that his laptop camera isn’t working, which is why the square on the screen where his face should be is blank. But actually he doesn’t want them to see what he looks like: Charlie is morbidly obese, a giant pool of Jabba the Hutt-type flesh, hardly able to leave the couch with a walking frame to get to the lavatory, gorging delivery pizzas and fried chicken, with a stash of chocolate bars in the desk drawer. Our first view of Charlie is of him masturbating to gay porn, culminating in a heart attack that almost kills him.But this isn’t supposed to be ironic black comedy and Charlie isn’t supposed to be greedy or lazy or selfish (although these uncaring talking points are not really aired). He is depressed after the death of his partner, a former student from an adult night-school class for whom he left his wife and young daughter; it was a desertion for which he is still guilt-stricken.Charlie’s only friend now is his late partner’s sister Liz (Hong Chau), a tough-minded nurse exasperated at his refusal to go to hospital. His fragile, lonely life becomes more complicated still with the arrival at his door of a strange young man, Thomas (Ty Simpkins), a Christian evangelist from the church of which Charlie’s partner was a member. His angry, conflicted daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), also appears to want to reconnect. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Venice film festival: This brilliant prequel to Goth and West’s previous collaboration, X, is a cine-fever dream set in the dying days of Spanish fluThe Venice film festival is springing some surprises on us, and one of the biggest and nicest has been the news that Mia Goth is an actual superstar: she is fiendishly good in this outrageous shocker from director Ti West, an origin-myth prequel to his previous film X, shot back-to-back on the same location. Goth starred in that one too, of course, but is now a co-writer on the followup; she takes her performance to the next level: Goth is now the Judy Garland of horror. Her work on the closing credits sequence alone deserves some kind of Golden Lion.The film itself is terrifically accomplished and horribly gripping, with golden-age movie pastiche and dashes of Psycho and The Wizard of Oz. And anyone tempted to look down on the horror genre might want to reflect that it is horror director West who has led the way in commenting on our key issue — his film is about the pandemic and how the lockdown experience incubates dysfunction and fear.The year is 1918, some 60 years before the action of X. Goth plays the eponymous Pearl, a young woman who is working hard on the family farm, longing for the return of her husband Howard who is away fighting in Europe — and she is also dreaming of making it as a dancer in the movies. The war is coming to an end and the Spanish flu is almost over, although Pearl still has to wear a mask when she goes into town on errands.But Pearl is deeply unhappy, and the lockdown has increased her frustration and her disturbing behaviour. Her German-born first-generation immigrant mother (Tandi Wright) is obsessed with godly hard work and afraid to mix with the locals for fear of anti-German sentiment. She is strict with Pearl to the point of cruelty and her father (Matthew Sutherland) has suffered a stroke and has to be tended to constantly. But Pearl has a fling with the local movie theatre projectionist (David Corenswet) who shows her one of his secret stash of explicit “stag” movies — a queasy premonition of the next film — and the newsreels he shows about the war and the trenches are moreover bizarrely explicit and real. He encourages Pearl to follow her dream, to break into pictures, and to that end attend local auditions for a touring dance troupe. But Pearl, her fingers always curling around the pitchfork handle, is not going to take kindly to rejection in any form.Like the first film, this is virtually a single location picture although there are adroitly managed scenes when Pearl goes shopping, secretly swigging the morphine she buys over the drugstore counter for her had and sneaking into the movies. Without Mia Goth’s grandiose performance, this would be nothing, and she and West contrive a genuinely brilliant scene when her sister-in-law (Emma Jenkins-Purro) thinks it would be cathartic for poor lonely Pearl to say to her what she is longing to say to her absent husband — and she gets a stream-of-consciousness aria of horror.Perhaps I shouldn’t have enjoyed Pearl as much as I did: but it’s clever, limber, gruesome and brutally well acted. A gem. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Venice film festival: There are some memorable moments in this documentary about the great Irish actor, but too many inconvenient truths are dismissed for it to be definitiveAdrian Sibley’s documentary is a genial, if sometimes incurious film about the legendary Irish actor and singer, who began his screen career as a pressure-cooker of rage on the rugby field in Lindsay Anderson’s This Sporting Life and finally became the beatific face of snowy-haired wisdom as Dumbledore in the first two Harry Potter movies.This watchable film goes easy on Harris’s boozing and brawling: in fact, it takes an almost a counter-revolutionary approach to the whole subject. In recent years, talk of Ollie and Peter and Richard’s hell-raising has usually been countered with a frowning diagnosis of alcoholism, and this film simply quotes Harris’s own roistering dismissal of all that: (“I drank because I loved it!”) and pretty much leaves things there. Incredibly, Harris hired a press photographer to cover a week-long post-divorce European jaunt via private plane he took with his entourage, which took in many bars and brothels – to humiliate his ex-wife, it is alleged, although his high-jinks were covered with giggling hilarity in the papers. Harris’s cocaine habit is hardly mentioned: I suspect because it doesn’t fit in with the essentially sentimental narrative of booze. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Venice film festival: Sigourney Weaver and Joel Edgerton can’t save this stilted, eccentric crime storyPaul Schrader is back with another variation on his signature theme, although now it feels like a fifth-generation Xerox. Here again is the lonely, driven male – derived from the philosopher-hero of Bresson’s Pickpocket – broodingly writing his journal of an evening in conditions of monkish austerity, haunted by the existential revelations of crime and a violent past, trying to transform or subsume his trauma into some new vocational obsession.Master Gardener has been described as the third film in a trilogy with First Reformed (2017) and The Card Counter (2021), although the resemblances go further back into his cv than that and Schrader is probably unique in that he is not merely an auteur but a genre unto himself. This new iteration is eccentric – an oddity, certainly, with its stately, formal dialogue set-pieces which feel somewhat like a modern translation or an adaptation of some older classic text. If Manoel de Oliveira were to direct a crime thriller, it might look like this. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Venice film festival 2022: Ricardo Darin anchors this courtroom drama as the chief prosecutor bringing military leaders to justice for human rights abuseThere’s a fair bit of Hollywoodised emotion in this true-life courtroom drama, but it is managed with terrific flair and heartfelt commitment, and Ricardo Darin gives a wonderful performance in the lead: witty, wry, careworn but idealistic. He plays Julio Strassera, the Argentinian chief prosecutor in charge of the junta trial in 1985, the biggest event since Nuremberg, though there was no only-following-orders argument: they were ones giving the orders. The event was easily as important as South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation commission 11 years later, although the emphasis was much more toughly on the “truth” part.Nine top military brass were put in the dock for human rights abuses, and this film shows their haughty refusal to recognise the authority of a civilian court — including Leopoldo Galtieri, who had been in charge of the shameful and catastrophic invasion of the Falklands just four years before. His presence is not especially remarked upon, but Mitre lets the unspoken anger hover in the air: Argentina’s army was tough enough to torture women and children, but not tough enough to capture las islas Malvinas.Peter Lanzani gives an attractive and sympathetic performance as Strassera’s deputy, Luis Moreno Ocampo, who had personal and family connections to Argentina’s ruling class and his mother, in particular, was a deeply conservative person, with an instinctive belief that the junta were innocent. Can Strassera and Ocampo somehow melt her heart? It’s almost too good to be true (although is evidently factual). And Darin is tremendous as Strassera, the grumpy old veteran who spies on his daughter to find out about her love life, and ends up rowing with Ocampo about the extent to which he had stayed silent, like all the rest of the governing class, for almost the entirety of his career.The movie appears to have exercised a little licence in imagining the smart young team of legal researchers the Strassera assembled to roam the country looking for witnesses, their presence gives the film a lot of zip. It’s a forthright, muscular and potent movie. Continue reading...",

That’s why they’re indexed twice a year, and every little bit helps. This indexation will be particularly big this month, because inflation is particularly challenging. And we know that it won’t solve every problem for everybody, but it’s important that we try and make sure that those payments keep up. That’s what the indexation is about. It will be welcome even as we acknowledge that times will still be tough for a lot of people.I’ve been really upfront with people before the election, during the election and after the election.

There were still plenty of frustrations of the offensive side of things, as they went 0-for-8 with runners in scoring position and stranded 11 on base. The ninth inning probably took years off our lives, with the Rays just a hit away from a walk-off win. However, it goes in the win column, and that’s what was needed more than anything.\nDesperate for some sort of offensive spark, the Yankees got off to the perfect start courtesy of — who else — Aaron Judge. In the leadoff spot, Judge took the second pitch of the game 450 feet to left, giving the Yankees the very early lead.\n\nMontas ended up going five innings in his best start as a Yankee to date. He allowed just one hit and no walks with seven strikeouts in his five frames. In terms of innings and performance, it was maybe a bit of a hasty move, but he had thrown a lot of pitches, thanks in part to some long at-bats and a couple innings extended by an Isiah Kiner-Falefa error and a Kyle Higashioka catcher’s interference. He was nearly at 100 pitches and would’ve started the third time through the order had he come back out for the sixth. That’s likely why the Yankees went to the bullpen and brought in Lou Trivino for the sixth. Trivino allowed a single to Yandy Díaz to start the inning, but worked around it to get that third out.\nIt should also be noted that catcher’s interference also played a role in manager Aaron Boone getting ejected. A couple innings prior, a misunderstanding seemed to lead to the Yankees using their replay review on a DJ LeMahieu foul out that Rays catcher Christian Bethancourt caught right near the screen behind home plate. After his requests to look at the catcher’s interference — which probably wouldn’t have been overturned — were denied, Boone was eventually tossed for arguing with home-plate umpire Vic Carapazza.\n\nAfter a couple missed chances, the Yankees finally added to their lead in the seventh. Following a Judge leadoff double, he narrowly managed to evade a tag and advance to third on a LeMahieu grounder. Oswaldo Cabrera then hit a fly ball that was deep enough for Judge to tag up and score without much trouble.\nRon Marinaccio entered for the seventh and quickly got into some trouble, allowing a double to David Peralta and walking Isaac Paredes. He would get the first out on a fly ball that kept the runners in place, but the Yankees would then go back to the bullpen and bring in Jonathan Loáisiga. While he struck out the first batter he faced, Loáisiga then issued a walk to load the bases. With the lineup flipping around back to the top, the 2021 relief ace managed to escape the jam, getting Díaz to ground out. Loáisiga would come back out for the eighth, but was much cleaner in that frame, quickly throwing a 1-2-3 inning.\nThe Yankees couldn’t add any further insurance in the top of the ninth, and then turned it over to Clay Holmes for the bottom of the inning. Things started off poorly when Peralta doubled to lead off the inning. After a fly out moved him to third, Francisco Mejía singled to get the Rays within a run. Although Holmes then got another fly out, Jonathan Aranda doubled to put the both the tying and winning run in scoring position. Díaz came up next and worked the count full. On the sixth pitch of the at-bat, Carapazza rang up Díaz for a strikeout on what was an arguably generous strike call, ending the game.\n\nAfter the win, the division lead is still just five games. Nothing about the win was particularly reassuring, but at this point, the Yankees will take what they can get (even on a day in which they learned that Andrew Benintendi was lost to a broken hamate bone). They return home to Yankee Stadium to begin a four-game series with the Twins tomorrow afternoon on Labor Day, with Jameson Taillon set to face Chris Archer at 1:05pm ET.\nBox Score",

        "description": "A federal judge on Friday tossed out a \"child pornography\" lawsuit filed by the man who appeared as the naked baby on the cover of Nirvana’s iconic 1991 album “Nevermind,\" handing a victory to the band after a yearlong legal battle.\n\n\n\nThe ruling is likely the end of 31-year-old Spencer Elden's litigation against Nirvana. Elden first sued the grunge rock band last year, alleging they had engaged in \"child pornography\" because the album cover featured a photo of him as a naked baby, swimming in a pool toward a dollar bill on a fish hook.\n\n\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Fernando Olguin in the Central District of California dismissed the case because Elden did not file the complaint within the 10-year statute of limitations for victims of sexual assaults or offenses. That statute requires him to file a complaint within 10 years of becoming reasonably aware of the personal injury.\n\n\n\n\"Plaintiff does not dispute that he knew of injuries arising from defendant's activities related to their use of his image on the 'Nevermind' album cover more than ten years before he filed this action,\" Olguin wrote in his opinion, agreeing with the defendants, who asked for a dismissal because of the statute limitation.\n\n\n\nElden was four months old when Nirvana hired Kirk Weddle to photograph him in a California pool for the album. \n\n\n\nUpon its release, \"Nevermind\" brought the band international fame and is widely considered to be one of the best rock albums of all time.\n\n\n\nIn August 2021, Elden sued Nirvana; Weddle; the estate of the late Kurt Cobain; Dave Grohl, the band's former drummer; bassist Krist Novoselic and Universal Music Group, among other defendants.\n\n\n\nIn January, Olguin ordered the case would be dismissed unless Elden filed an amended complaint, which he did that month, seeking $150,000&nbsp;in damages.\n\n\n\nIn the amended complaint, Elden argues the album cover features a \"lascivious exhibition\" of his \"genitals on the cover.”\n\n\n\n“The conduct depicted, particularly the activation of Spencer’s gag reflex and the prominence and positioning of his genitals in the image, suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity,” the complaint reads. “The image was intended and designed to elicit a sexual response.”\n\n\n\nNirvana and the other defendants pushed back, saying the now-famous photograph is protected by artistic expression and the photo evokes images of a cherub, or an angelic baby.\n\n\n\nThe defendants also accused Elden of \"profiting from his celebrity as the self-anointed ‘Nirvana Baby'\" and picking up women with the title.",

That’s why they’re indexed twice a year, and every little bit helps. This indexation will be particularly big this month, because inflation is particularly challenging. And we know that it won’t solve every problem for everybody, but it’s important that we try and make sure that those payments keep up. That’s what the indexation is about. It will be welcome even as we acknowledge that times will still be tough for a lot of people.I’ve been really upfront with people before the election, during the election and after the election. I’ve said to you many times over the last six months or so that it would be too expensive to continue that petrol price relief indefinitely.

        "description": "Photo by Cliff Welch/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  The rest of the trade deadline acquisition’s 2022 season is now in serious doubt. The Yankees managed to eke out a narrow 2-1 victory over the Rays on Sunday to avoid a sweep and push their AL East lead back up to five games. It was stressful, but undoubtedly good news. Unfortunately, not all the news that emerged from the afternoon was positive.\nImmediately after New York sealed its victory, manager Aaron Boone told reporters that outfielder Andrew Benintendi had broken the hook of his hamate bone and would need surgery. Acquired from the Royals at the trade deadline, the 28-year-old got off to a slow start, but his bat was one of the few among the Yankees to show any signs of life in recent weeks outside of Aaron Judge. From August 16th onward, he hit .300/.338/.500 with seven extra-base hits and a 138 wRC+.\nThen came Friday night’s 9-0 disaster, which involved Benintendi leaving an at-bat in the third inning after hearing a pop in his wrist.\n\nApparently, the surgery is not necessarily season-ending ...\n\n\nIt's a fractured hamate (right hand) for Andrew Benintendi, requiring surgery. Not necessarily season ending, but he'll know more tomorrow after seeing a specialist.— Pete Caldera (@pcaldera) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\n... but it’s hard to imagine Benintendi returning to the Yankees in any meaningful capacity this year. Hand injuries can be notoriously tricky to recover from, and just to use one example (per writer Deesha Thosar), Mets catcher James McCann missed six weeks with the same surgery.\nSix weeks from now would put us around the end of the ALDS and ALCS. Forget whether or not the struggling 2022 Yankees can pick up the pieces enough to still be playing by then — Kyle Schwarber-esque comebacks in the middle of the playoffs are quite rare. Maybe Benintendi can beat the odds because his situation is a little weird due to a prior surgery in college to remove the hamate bone, but the smart play is not to hold your breath.\nWith Benintendi out, the pressure only increases on both Judge to keep up his home run heroics and on the rest of the lineup to actually give him some damn help. It’s probably going to lead to too much Aaron Hicks rather than rookie Estevan Florial, who took Benintendi’s roster spot and strikes out a ton, but can cover center field much more capably while at least offering a change of pace from Hicks’ atrocious second-half showing at the plate. The little-used Tim Locastro and utilityman Marwin Gonzalez — he of the 0-for-29 since July 6th — might make some similarly unwanted appearances, too, and I guess Giancarlo Stanton is eventually a possibility if his left Achilles tendinitis recovery allows for it.\nHarrison Bader completing a successful comeback from plantar fasciitis would also be key, but he is only in the process of a “10-day ramp up” at this point with no rehab games yet, so who knows when he’ll be back? For now, the best outfield formation involves Judge, Florial, and perhaps rookie Oswaldo Cabrera in right, but again, I expect an unhealthy amount of Hicks.",

The game of baseball, as do most things in life, tends to have a way of sorting itself out. \nFor the Miami Marlins offense, most are wondering if and when this will be the case. The past 33 games entering Sunday’s series finale in Atlanta have been akin to a funeral dirge to run scoring. In that span - dating back to July 29th - Miami has hit a collective .195/.265/.309, in which they’ve gone 8-25 and fallen 22 games under .500.\nSo, when Atlanta starter Max Fried, who has been a mere mortal in 11 preceding starts against Miami - pitching to a 5.40 ERA - began the afternoon with 5 no-hit innings, you almost felt it a perfect meeting of anemic offense and dominant pitching.\n\n\nMax Fried is dealing  No further comment at this time. pic.twitter.com/OynIOF3uHe— Bally Sports: Braves (@BravesOnBally) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nAnd then, the rain, which had started in the 4th inning, intensified. After coaxing in an inning-ending double play against Joey Wendle, out came the tarps.\nAtlanta would get the scoring started in the 3rd thanks to a Dansby Swanson sacrifice fly to score Eddie Rosario. Marcel Ozuna, recently arrested and charged with a DUI on August 19th, sent a 96-mph Pablo López offering just over the right field stands for his 21st home run of the season. \n\n\n\n\nDespite going just 4 innings in the 7-1 loss, López looked sharp, K-ing 7 as he reached 150 innings pitched on the season. \nAn hour and fifty-one minutes later as the tarps were listed, Fried’s day was done, the no-hitter still intact.\nIn relief of Fried, Jesse Chavez etched two scoreless innings, though Miami would collect their first hit courtesy of a Miguel Rojas single. \nMiami’s lone run would come via an RBI single by the prior-noted Wendle. \nLooking Ahead\nAs if they didn’t already need a mental day off, the Marlins partake in the Labor Day festivities as they travel to Philadelphia to begin a mid-week series against the Phillies. Miami will give the ball to Jesús Luzardo (3-6, 3.44 ERA) as he looks to bounce back after allowing 5 runs in an August 30th loss to Tampa Bay. Philadelphia has yet to announce a starter for the series opener. First is slated for 6:45 Eastern. \nOf Note\n\nPer Baseball-Savant’s pitch data courtesy of Statcast, the two 97.1 mph fastballs López threw Sunday set new career bests. The right-hander’s previous fastest pitch, 96.9 mph, came on 06/19 last season to Kris Bryant, then of the Chicago Cubs.\nWith the loss, Miami falls to 4-12 against Atlanta this season.\n\n  \n        \n      Baseball-Savant\n      Miami Marlins (1) @ Atlanta Braves (7), Win Probability Graph, 4th September 2022",

        "description": "David Banks-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Twins avoid the sweep in Chicago and pull within a half game of Cleveland for the AL Central lead.  The Twins desperately needed a win today to avoid the sweep and also avoid losing their 4th straight game before heading to Nee York tomorrow. Dylan Bundy gave them a great chance to do it, as he tossed 5 scoreless innings on only 66 pitches. The game remained locked at 0-0 until the top of the 5th, when Carlos Correa crushed a 2 run homer to left center that gave the Twins a 2-0 lead. The White Sox would answer back in the 7th with a double from AJ Pollock that cut the Twins lead in half, and it looked like they were ready to add on more. And then Jhoan Duran came in. Inning over. The Twins would add an insurance run in the 8th on a wild pitch by Kendall Graveman, then a couple more in the 9th on an RBI double by Jose Miranda. The Twins would win by a final score of 5-1, pulling within a half game of the lead in the most mid division in baseball. If it ever stops raining in Cleveland, the Twins could pull even with the Guardians if the Seattle Mariners can finish off a win today. Our boys will head east to take on the big bad Yankees (who haven’t been that big and bad lately!) starting tomorrow afternoon. \nSTUDSCarlos Correa: 2-5, HR, double.

Jake quickly gave up two singles, and was yanked after facing four batters. So with two on and two out for Kendall Graveman, he uncorked a wild pitch that scored Kepler from third before striking out Sanchez. Twins lead, 3-1.  \nFan frustration rears its ugly head again, as the Sox try to get something going in the bottom of the eighth.  \n\n\nJust when you think this team has turned a corner, you find out that they still have a problem executing the little things when you need them to execute the little things.

After Celestino grounded out, Arráez singled. Former White Sox speedster Billy Hamilton came in to pinch-run, but again was proven a double-agent for the White Sox, tripping over third base and failing to score on a Correa double.  \n\n\nBilly 100000% still riding for the Sox. That's twice this series lol— SoxOptimist (@OptimistSox) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nHowever, it really didn’t matter, as Miranda doubled on a line drive, scoring Hamilton and Correa. VV got the final two outs of the inning, but the damage was done. Twins up, 5-1.\n\n\nSox back to their infuriating selves today— Brian Knights (@BrianKnights3) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nTwins put in pitcher Caleb Thielbar for the ninth to face Jiménez, Engel (pinch-hitting for Sheets), and Zavala. Zavala managed to hit a rocket single in the left-field corner.  Unfortunately, that was it, as Pollock flied out to end the game. It’s not ALL bad news though, Sox fans.\n\n\nGood news White Sox fans, Seattle is about to sweep Cleveland. Would keep the Sox only 2 games back. Bad news they go to Seattle for a three game series against that VERY    Mariners team. #ChangeTheGame— Drew Bogs (@DrewBogs623) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nTomorrow is another day! Early start in Seattle. See you then!",

        "description": "Albert Pujols is the story of this game, so he gets the lead photo | Joe Puetz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  This comes under the category of “You have got to be kidding me.” Every single Cardinals fan in Busch Stadium Sunday — and not ONE single Cubs fan — was hoping that Albert Pujols would come to bat one final time against the Cubs in the last 2022 game between the two teams and hit a home run.\nWelp. That’s exactly what happened, a two-run shot, and that was the difference in the Cardinals’ 2-0 win over the Cubs on a rainy afternoon where the start of the game was delayed nearly 90 minutes.\nThis recap will focus on that home run.\nMarcus Stroman threw seven brilliant innings, yet another fantastic outing for him away from Wrigley Field. He threw 98 pitches (66 strikes), allowed four hits (two singles, two doubles) and didn’t walk anyone. His ERA in road games dropped to 1.83 (12 starts, 68⅓ innings). Seriously, if I’m David Ross I try to arrange the rotation so Stroman starts only road games the rest of the year.\nStroman was helped out by some fine defense. Here’s Ian Happ making a fine sliding catch in the second inning [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nRafael Ortega with a similar sliding catch in the sixth [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are Stroman’s five strikeouts [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nAll that is really, really good stuff.\nCardinals starter Miles Mikolas did Stroman one better — eight shutout innings, allowing just two hits (a single by Christopher Morel, a double by Franmil Reyes) and a walk.\nSo the game went to the bottom of the eighth scoreless. David Ross had choices going into this inning — and during it — so let’s look at them.\nBrandon Hughes was sent out to pitch. Two of the first four hitters due up were lefthanded (Lars Nootbaar and Brendan Donovan). Coming into this game, Hughes had held RH hitters to a lower OPS (.607 in 110 PA) than LH hitters (.655 OPS, 77 PA). It’s an absolutely defensible move. Plus, this is learning time, not necessarily “winning games time” — Ross and the front office need to see who could be a useful part of the 2023 bullpen.\nHughes retired Andrew Knizner and then Tommy Edman doubled.\nCardinals manager Oli Marmol sent Pujols up to bat for Nootbaar. This was utterly predictable, given the platoon situation AND the fact that it’s the kind of situation Pujols has always loved.\nThe question here isn’t whether to have Hughes in the game — once he’s in, he had to face that hitter, it’s the third batter of the inning. He has faced Pujols exactly once before now — he hit him with a pitch August 4 in the first game of a doubleheader.\nThe question, with first base open, is why didn’t Ross order Pujols intentionally walked? Oh, how the crowd would have booed, but the Cubs don’t care about that.\nThe only answer here is: This is a situation for Hughes to get this particular hitter out, to see how he reacts in this sort of situation. Obviously, it didn’t work and the Pujols home run gave the Cardinals the win.\nRemember: Wins don’t matter right now. Yes, of course we want the Cubs to win games, but at 20+ games under .500, what difference does it make? Find out what you’ve got in the bullpen for 2023.\nThat’s how I see it, anyway.\nFor Pujols, it was his 695th career home run, one more and he ties Alex Rodriguez for fourth place on the all-time list. It was his 59th against the Cubs. That broke a tie with Gil Hodges for eighth-most against the Cubs all-time. The top eight now: Willie Mays (92), Henry Aaron (87), Mike Schmidt (78), Mel Ott (77), Stan Musial (67), Eddie Mathews (64), Duke Snider (60) and Pujols. The other seven all played at least 70 more games against the Cubs than Pujols did, and some played almost 150 more. It’s a really impressive feat and a tip o’ the cap to Pujols for an incredible career that will wind up on a stage in Cooperstown in a few years.\nThe Cubs will have Labor Day off — yes, some teams do these days on holidays — and open a three-game series against the Reds at Wrigley Field Tuesday evening. We are told that Wade Miley will come off the injured list and start against his old team in that game. He’ll be opposed by Justin Dunn. Game time Tuesday is 6:40 p.m. CT and TV coverage will be via Marquee Sports Network.",

        "description": "Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) on Sunday called former President Trump’s rally the day prior “bizarre,” saying he was proving right President Biden’s warnings about “MAGA Republicans.”\n\n\n\nTrump on Saturday traveled to Wilkes-Barre, Penn. in support of Republican candidates in the state’s upcoming gubernatorial and Senate elections. During his speech, the former president criticized the FBI as “vicious monsters” after it searched his Florida home and called Biden an “enemy of the state” for condemning Trump’s movement during a recent primetime address.\n\n\n\n“Well it’s bizarre,” Lofgren said when asked about the latter remark during an appearance on “CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“President Biden did caution Americans about extremism in his speech in Philadelphia, and the ex-president is proving his case,” she continued. “To call out law enforcement as vicious enemies, I understand that he identified an FBI agent by name on his social media, probably exposing that law enforcement official to threats that we’ve seen.”\n\n\n\nBiden’s primetime address on Thursday portrayed Trump and his \"MAGA\" movement as a threat to democracy.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have called the speech as divisive and condescending, but White House officials have pushed back, arguing defending democracy is not a partisan issue.\n\n\n\n“If we want to be accurate about it, as threats to democracy and as enemies of the state — you're all enemies of the state,” Trump said. “[Biden’s] an enemy of the state, you know that? The enemy of the state is him and the group that control him.”\n\n\n\nTrump has also repeatedly attacked the FBI after it executed a search warrant at his Florida home, accusing the agency of pursuing its investigation for political motives.\n\n\n\nLofgren also pushed back on those saying Biden smeared the entire Republican party with his comments. \n\n\n\n“The Republican voters I know here in my district — they didn't steal classified documents and put them in a little room off their pool,” Lofgren told Acosta. “The ex-president did that.”",

        "description": "Many Republicans have rallied to former President Trump's defense over the FBI's search of his Mar-a-Lago home, echoing his claims that the move was politically motivated and unjustified. \n\n\n\nHowever, a number of GOP figures have broken ranks to defend the Justice Department and critique Trump’s handling of classified material.\n\n\n\nNewly-unsealed records show FBI agents found more than 100 classified documents at the Palm Beach, Fl., resort — as well as dozens of empty folders marked as classified in Trump's personal office.\n\n\n\nTrump and his team have given conflicting defenses for how and why the classified documents ended up there.\n\n\n\nThese GOP figures have knocked the former president over the revelations. \n\n\n\nWilliam Barr\n\n\n\nTrump's former Attorney General William Barr said last week that the DOJ probably has “pretty good evidence” against the former president to have reached this point in its investigation.\n\n\n\n“I can’t think of a legitimate reason why they should have been, could be taken out of the government, away from the government, if they’re classified,” Barr said of the classified documents Friday on Fox News.\n\n\n\nHe also hit back on criticism of the search of the former president's home as “unprecedented.” \n\n\n\n“I think the driver on this from the beginning was loads of classified information sitting in Mar-a-Lago. People say this was unprecedented, well, it's also unprecedented for a president to take all this classified information and put them in a country club,” Barr said.\n\n\n\nTrump then slammed Barr on his Truth Social platform, calling the former AG a “weak and pathetic RINO,” or “Republican in Name Only.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJohn Bolton\n\n\n\nTrump’s former national security adviser John Bolton said last month that the former president’s varying explanations for and defense of the documents found at his home “shows a real level of desperation.”\n\n\n\nSome Trump officials have claimed the then-president had a standing order to declassify documents — but Bolton, who served under Trump from 2018 to 2019, said he wasn't aware of any such order during his tenure.\n\n\n\nBolton said on CBS News last week that Trump’s handling of the documents “shows a real disdain for the seriousness of the classification at issue,” noting that most offices would be very clear and careful in handling such sensitive material.\n\n\n\n“This to me is more evidence that Donald Trump didn't give much attention to the sensitivity of the classified information,\" Bolton said.\n\n\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\n\nKarl Rove, who was a senior adviser to former President George W. Bush, said last week that Trump “had no legal authority” to take the classified documents to Mar-a-Lago.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Why he was holding on to these materials when he had no legal authority to do so under the Presidential Records Act is beyond me,” Rove said on Fox News.\n\n\n\nIn keeping the documents, Rove said, Trump took “the property of the American people.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“A president does not have the right to leave the White House and pick and choose what documents he wants to take with him,” Rove said.\n\n\n\nLiz Cheney\n\n\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who recently lost her reelection bid to Trump-backed Harriet Hageman in Wyoming’s GOP primary, stood firm in her refute of the former president after the Mar-a-Lago search.\n\n\n\n“Yet more indefensible conduct by Donald Trump revealed this morning,” Cheney said on Twitter last week, sharing the now widely-circulated photo of classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCheney was one of 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach then-President Trump and now sits on the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlyssa Farah Griffin\n\n\n\nFormer White House Communications Director Alyssa Farah Griffin on Sunday knocked Trump’s handling of the classified material.\n\n\n\nGriffin said on CNN’s “State of the Union\" that there are \"very specific protocols\" for how such documents should be handled, even for those within government. \n\n\n\n“There is no way that this is acceptable if you don't believe in a two-tiered system of justice, where a former president is above the law,\" she added. \n\n\n\nGriffin floated the possibility that Trump may have taken the classified documents unknowingly — but also questioned whether the former president may have kept the documents for later use as “leverage” to “help his future political ambitions.” \n\n\n\nCharlie Dent\n\n\n\nFormer Pennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent (R) on Saturday pushed back against outrage from Trump and his supporters over the FBI search.\n\n\n\n“If any member of Congress absconded with classified material, I can assure you that a G-Man, somebody from the FBI, would have showed up at their homes and demanded that they return that information,” Dent said on CNN.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Penn., on Saturday night — his first after the search of his home — Trump lambasted the FBI for the Mar-a-Lago search, knocking it as “one of the most shocking abuses of power by any administration in American history.”&nbsp;",

        "description": "Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Dodgers will try to go four-for-four in series against Padres The Dodgers will finish their last home series against the Padres in the regular season today with an ESPN Sunday “Night” Game.  It will be over 100 degrees on the field so expect a lot of pitchers on the mound.\nThe Dodgers have already won their first three series of the year against the Padres with today’s game deciding this weekend’s set.\nCaleb Ferguson will get the start, his first since August 27, 2020, as the opener.  The Dodgers have not used an opener that many times this season.  Back in May, Ryan Pepiot and Mitch White each started what would be bullpen games for the Dodgers.  \nAnd in any case, no pitcher that has started for the Dodgers has at least completed two innings and faced no less than 11 batters.  Ferguson has only gotten four outs twice this season so it would be likely that he is going just one today.\nThe Dodgers announced earlier today that left-handed pitcher David Price was placed on the Injured List and right-handed pitcher Ryan Pepiot was recalled.  Pepiot will follow Ferguson. \nMike Clevinger has made one start against the Dodgers this year, it was during their last series at Dodger Stadium.  The Dodgers would score five runs on seven hits against Clevinger on their way to an 8-3 win.  Both Will Smith and Max Muncy homered against Clevinger.\nThe Dodgers will make at least one more appearance on Sunday Night Baseball as their final regular season game against the Giants at Oracle Park on September 18th will be on ESPN.\nThe Dodgers also have two games on Apple TV+, Friday September 16th against the Giants as well as the following Friday September 23rd when the Dodgers host the St. Louis Cardinals on Elton John Bobblehead Night.\n\nGame info\n\nTeams: Dodgers (91-41) vs. Padres (74-60)\nPitchers: Caleb Ferguson vs. Mike Clevinger\nLocation: Dodger Stadium\nTime: 4:08 p.m. PT\nTV: ESPN",

        "description": "Retailer’s research shows people want to spend money on enjoying life day to day as cost of living continues to riseFor close to a century, John Lewis has been “never knowingly undersold”, but the retailer is now positioning itself as being there “for all life’s moments” as it adapts to a profound shift in spending habits driven by Covid-19 and rising living costs.The pledge is designed to tap into what the department store chain is billing as the “moments economy”, as Britons spend smaller amounts on enjoying day-to-day life – from hosting a dinner party to celebrating a dog’s birthday – rather than splurging on set-piece events such as foreign holidays.

        "description": "Photo by Dylan Buell/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Rockies won a fun game one to break a losing streak and then got absolutely trounced in game two. Game 1: Rockies 8, Reds 4: Let the kids play\nThe Rockies were able to take game one in today’s double header thanks to some fun baseball played by the “kids.” \nTJ Friedl against the world\nThe two runs scored by the Reds both came on solo home runs from TJ Friedl. The first home run came in the bottom of the fourth inning, with the second coming in the bottom of the sixth inning. Both home runs were tagged to Germán Márquez.\nThe kids, they’re fun to watch\nSean Bouchard, Michael Toglia and Elehuris Montero are a joy to watch. The top of the seventh inning brought great at-bats from all of them. The Rockies were able to have a productive inning following CJ Cron being hit by a pitch. \nMontero singled, Toglia singled and Bouchard walked, but those three combined were able to score Cron. After a Hampson strikeout, Buddy called on Charlie Blackmon to pinch hit with the bases full of Rockies. A wild pitch tied of the game and the Rockies were back in business. Chuck was able to single in two runs to give the Rockies a 4-2 lead. \n\n\nRockies' 4-run 7th inning pic.twitter.com/CzveNCevBP— RoxGifsVids (@RoxGifsVids) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThat wasn’t it for the kids, though. Brendan Rodgers started off the eight inning with a walk and with some heads up base running, found himself on third with Michael Toglia up to bat. Toglia was ready to increase the lead and doubled to bring home Rodgers and give the Rockies a 5-2 lead. \n\n\nMichael Toglia's RBI double scores Brendan Rodgers pic.twitter.com/Ahh4eaD72C— RoxGifsVids (@RoxGifsVids) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThe rest of the game\nCarlos Estévez had a less than thrilling eighth inning. He walked Colin Moran and was lucky that Friedl hit a foul ball and not another home run, however, the luck didn’t last long. Jonathan India blasted a two-run home run to make it a one-run game. \nElías Díaz started off the ninth inning with a walk, and with some heads up base running, was able to make it to third base on a Randal Grichuk single. It wasn’t pretty but Brendan Rodgers reached on a fielders choice, Díaz scored and Grichuk was tagged out. But, that’s not it. CJ Cron launched a two-run home run to make it 8-4. Anyone else like insurance runs? \n\n\npic.twitter.com/phESg8cUMU— RoxGifsVids (@RoxGifsVids) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Rockies needed Daniel Bard to pitch a clean ninth inning and he came through.\nOn to game two. \nGame 2: Reds 10, Rockies 0: Shut Down and Shut Out\nThe norm this season for the Rockies in regards to double headers is that they get thrashed in game one before putting up a fight and getting the win in game two. This afternoon they decided to flip the script and got completely shut down and shut out by the Reds in a 10-0 loss.\nUreña Not Sharp\nRockies pitcher José Ureña made his 12th start this afternoon and continued his Jekyll and Hyde season. After a solid outing his last time up against the Atlanta Braves, Ureña struggled this afternoon in a 5 1⁄3 inning performance against the Reds. Though he only gave up one walk, Ureña only struck out one batter while allowing eight hits. He gave up seven runs—six earned—and didn’t have a clean inning until the bottom of the fifth. While Chad Smith’s poor performance out of the bullpen and an error from Ryan McMahon didn’t help him this afternoon, Ureña wasn’t sharp as he failed to hit his spots and consistently had batters putting the ball in play.\nNot a Chad\nRookie reliever Chad Smith isn’t on the hook for the loss, but is the man mostly responsible for the Reds blowing the whole affair wide open. Smith replaced José Ureña with one out in the bottom of the sixth. After walking two batters to load the bases, Smith faced Aristides Aquino. Aquino was taking his first full at-bat after replacing an injured Jonathan India. Aquino took two pitches without swinging before demolishing a center-cut sinker for a grand slam, putting the Reds up 10-0. That score would hold for the remainder of the game. Both Jhoulys Chacín and Ty Blach pitched scoreless, hitless frames to finish out the ballgame.\nThe Offense Sank in the Ohio River\nThe Rockies offense didn’t appear in the second game of the double header. Despite having 12 total baserunners, the Rockies failed to score a single run in the shutout loss. Eight of those baserunners were walked aboard and the Rockies had just four hits. The Rockies went 0-for-6 with RISP. Reds starter Chase Anderson entered the game with a 27.00 ERA and walked four batters, but the Rockies couldn’t get a hit off of him in 2 2⁄3 innings and struck out four times. The Rockies were able to get to reliever Derek Law over his two frames of relief with three hits and a walk, but couldn’t get any runners home to capitalize. Colorado only had one more hit over the next 4 1⁄3 innings, but did draw three more walks. Their lone extra base hits came from recent callups Michael Toglia and Alan Trejo.\n\n\nMichael Toglia's 3rd double of the season pic.twitter.com/kW1lLSXfr9— RoxGifsVids (@RoxGifsVids) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nComing Up Next\nThe Rockies head home tonight and prepare for a six game homestand that starts against the Milwaukee Brewers. Ryan Feltner will face off against Freddy Peralta in an afternoon affair. First pitch is at 2:10 PM MDT.",

        "description": "Photo by David J. Griffin/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Max Fried pitched five hitless frames before being forced out by rain; the Braves’ bats rampaged through the Miami relief corps. A long rain delay forced Max Fried out of a great start that included five hitless innings, but couldn’t break the Braves’ offensive stride as they overwhelmed Miami en route to a 7-1 win and a three-game sweep. With the Mets randomly dropping another game against the Nationals, the Braves’ deficit in the NL East is down a single, measly game.\nFried had a lot of command trouble last time out against the Rockies, but was back in fine, best-pitcher-in-the-league-type form in this game early, bamboozling the Marlins into both whiffs and weak contact. Fried retired the first 12 batters he faced without much effort — he allowed just one hard-hit ball and one ball with a hit probability over 18 percent across those batters, including striking out the side in the fourth. The only real blemish on his day was a five-pitch walk to Nick Fortes to start the fifth. However, he rectified the mistake pretty quickly with a strikeout and then a double play. After said twin killing, the game endured a long, multi-hour rain delay, forcing Fried out of the proceedings. As a result, he finished his day with a 6/1 K/BB ratio in five hitless frames, across which he faced the minimum. \nThe Braves, meanwhile, were not having anything near the same level of trouble with Pablo Lopez. Though Lopez got through the first two innings without allowing a run, the Braves had three hard-hit balls in two frames alone, and would have scored had a two-out single-double sequence from Michael Harris II and Vaughn Grissom not ended with Marcell Ozuna making an out on a hard grounder to third.\nThe Atlanta attack finally broke through in the bottom of the third. Eddie Rosario lined a leadoff single, and moved to third on Ronald Acuña Jr.’s 113 mph low liner, ground-rule double. Dansby Swanson followed with a sacrifice fly to deep center, though Lopez was able to avoid further damage by striking out both Austin Riley and Travis d’Arnaud around an intentional walk to Matt Olson.\nNo matter, though. The Braves tacked off in the fourth off Lopez with Marcell Ozuna’s 21st homer of the year, hit out to right on an 0-2 pitch. Jeff Brigham, who replaced Lopez after the rain delay, survived a few deep flyouts by the Braves in the fifth, but then gave up a two-spot in the sixth: Olson drew a leadoff walk, moved to third on a d’Arnaud single into right-center, and scored on a liner back up the box by Harris; d’Arnaud scored on a wild pitch later in the inning. \nThe Braves used Jesse Chavez to cover two of the game’s remaining four frames, and he did a Jesse Chavez-type job, striking out three, walking none, and allowing just a single hit (the Marlins’ first of the game). Collin McHugh gave up a run in the eighth (single bobbled by Rosario in right, leading to a “double,” followed by an RBI single), but later struck out leadoff man Charles Leblanc with runners on second and third and two out to end the inning. Kirby Yates pitched a scoreless ninth, leadoff walk and all, to seal the sweep.\nThe Braves tacked on more runs against Miami relievers in the eighth, too. Andrew Nardi allowed back-to-back walks to start the inning, and Harris singled home Olson again. After two outs, pinch-hitter Robbie Grossman (who walked to end the game last night) drew another free pass to load the bases, forcing Nardi out of the game. In came Cole Sulser, and Acuña greeted him with a flare into center that capped the scoring. All in all, every Brave reached base in the game but for Austin Riley, who went 0-for-5 with three strikeouts, and pinch-hitter Guillermo Heredia, who came on as a defensive replacement and fouled out. Matt Olson drew three walks; Michael Harris II had three hits and now has a 145 wRC+ on the year.\nThe rain, and the fact that Carlos Rodon pitched today, prevented Max Fried from taking over the NL lead in fWAR. Still, he collected 0.3 fWAR on the day, putting him into a tie with Aaron Nola for second place with 4.9, behind Rodon’s 5.3. Rodon, to his credit, threw up a 10/2 K/BB ratio against the Phillies today.\nWith the division deficit at a single game, the Braves will head out to Oakland, Seattle, and then San Francisco (yeesh, why not the two Bay Area locales back-to-back?). They will resume play in Oakland on Tuesday after enjoying a restful Labor Day on Monday.",

        "description": "“Turambar drinks wine?” | Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Vacation Edition!! Record: 64-69. Pace: 78-84. Change on 2021: +20. \nThat’s right folks: I’m actually on vacation in California wine country (central coast) as I write this.  So Lopez and Nik are right, for once.\nEnough about them though.  Let’s focus on this game I’m only gonna kinda pay attention to.\nInning 1-2:\nChilling, as is my want, in Paso Robles waiting for the train south to San Luis Obisbo at a little wine tasting room at the train station.  With a Malbec in hand I casually note that Gallen cruises through the 1st and 2nd inning.   Luxury.\nNo action for our bats in the 1st, but the 2nd sees King Alek sacrifice himself for the greater good to bring home the future of this team: Corbin Carroll.  Praise be.  1-0 Dbacks.\nInning 3:\nGallen laughs at the Brewers.  He laughs from his mountain.  Almost certain the Brewers will know no glory this day, but we shall see. Varsho on the other hand is made of glory.  His 20th homer of the season exits BOB gracefully and we’re now at a comfy 2-0 lead.  Splendid.  Inning 4:\nGallen doing Gallen things yet again, though I feel he’s not getting the number of K’s I’d normally anticipate, yet another luxury for me to gripe about.   No further fun for us in the bottom of the 4th, though I take further comfort seeing Alek with a hit.   He, like several other Dbacks, represents the future.\nInning 5:\nLOL.  Gallen must have sensed my displeasure, as he strikes out the side in the 5th.  Holy shit he’s good!  Would sure be swell if he got some run support though……\nAnother hope for the future helps extend our lead as I had prayed.  Thanks Jake McCarthy!!!!!   3-0 Dbacks \nInning 6:\nAn Amtrak employee just informed us that we’re at a full stop, in a tunnel, due to a red signal, without a reason yet.  Fun.  \nStop trains do not bother Gallen though, as seemingly nothing will, and yet another Brewers scoreless frame passes by.\nInning 7:\nThe hills of Central California roll by.  I imagine Gallen views Brewers batters in the same way: calmly, mildly interested, and sanguine.\nAfter another predictably calm Gallen inning we have another meh Dbats session.  No biggy I guess. Inning 8:\nGallen, likely after a yawn, relinquishes his thrown atop the mound to Kyle Nelson.  Big shoes to fill, but basically be just needs to not fuck up catastrophically.  Blessedly he does his job and we’re off to the bottom of the frame.  \nMcCarthy joins Varsho in today’s home run club.  His 7th of the year makes this a 5-0 game and kinda puts the Brewers to bed in a big way.    Inning 9:\nDespite Melancon attempting to ruin my vacation he only gives up a single run to close this game out and thus the Dbacks request for .500 continues….\nBells and whistles, by Jim\n  \n        \n  \nClick for details at Fangraphs.com\nKodak moment: Zac Gallen, +37.1%\nOut of focus: Emmanuel Rivera, -5.7%\nGallen rolls his scoreless streak to 41.1 innings, which sits only just behind Brandon Webb’s 42 inning run, over fifteen years ago. It was also Zac’s sixth start in a row where he went at least six innings, allowed no runs and held the opposition to four hits or fewer. That is practically unprecedented in major-league history. Only one pitcher has even gone past four in that feat: Zack Greinke as a Los Angeles Dodger in 2015, matched Gallen’s six. His next start will depend on how the rotation shakes out after the arrival of Nelson tomorrow, but next Sunday in Coors Field currently seems most likely. \nA lightly-trafficked Gameday Thread, with under a hundred comments. There were a few Sedona Red comments, albeit mostly me counting up the scoreless streak. But we did also get this from Snake_Bitten.\n  \n        \n  \nHaving done a number of the Brewers’ post-season chances it’s on to their rivals for the third wild-card in San Diego, to see if we can make things more difficult for them as well. It’s a three game set, beginning tomorrow night at 7:10 pm. Ryne Nelson will be making his major-league debut, as the starter for the Diamondbacks.",

Since the start of the pandemic, we have kept you posted on what the Yankees have been up to on social media. Now that the 2022 regular season is nearing its conclusion, we’ll continue to see action from our favorite players and Yankee figures. Here’s your weekly update on what your favorite Yankees have been doing on social media!\nAn A-Rod comeback?\nThe soon-to-retire Albert Pujols is chasing 700 career home runs and after belting No. 695 today, he currently sits just one behind Alex Rodriguez’s career total of 696 (fourth on the all-time list). A-Rod took to social media to make a video joking about whether or not he should come back to the league and race Pujols to 700. Perhaps the Yankees could use his bat.\n\n\nYou tell me ... should I make a comeback?    #RaceTo700 pic.twitter.com/0GTfApOjGR— Alex Rodriguez (@AROD) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nDeath, taxes, Aaron Judge bombs\nSpeaking of homers, we’re watching Aaron Judge chase history as well, as he’s nine homers away from breaking Roger Maris’ American League home run record. Every time he comes to the plate, everyone watching expects him to hit one very, very far away from home plate — even his former teammate, CC Sabathia, who tweets about almost every single Judge bomb.\n\n\n50  ‍⚖️— CC Sabathia (@CC_Sabathia) August 30, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath, taxes,  ‍⚖️ — CC Sabathia (@CC_Sabathia) August 31, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n ‍⚖️— CC Sabathia (@CC_Sabathia) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nNick Swisher ready for college football\nThe college football season began this weekend and Nick Swisher was pumped. The former Yankees outfielder not only grew up in Ohio, but also played college baseball at Ohio State for the Buckeyes. To Swish’s delight, OSU won its opener over Notre Dame, 21-10.\n\n      \n\n\n \n View this post on Instagram\n\n \n   \n\n  \n\n   \n\n   \nA post shared by Nick Swisher (@yourboyswish)",

        "description": "Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, said on Sunday that former President Trump’s recent attacks against the FBI “potentially” amount to incitement.\n\n\n\nDuring an appearance on “CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta,” Acosta asked Lofgren about Trump’s characterization of the FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) as “vicious monsters” during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday evening.\n\n\n\n“You've looked at, along with the committee, Trump’s rhetoric leading up to January 6th,” Acosta said. “Do you think that kind of rhetoric is more incitement essentially?”\n\n\n\n“Well, potentially yes,” Lofgren responded. “In the lead-up to January 6th, there were extravagant claims made meant to inflame public opinion, and that is what is happening here.”\n\n\n\n“Although I think it's meant to turn people against law enforcement officers,” she continued. “And we’ve seen that sometimes that rhetoric reaches people who are prepared to act on it.”\n\n\n\nLofgren voted to impeach Trump for incitement to insurrection after the Capitol attack and has attempted to portray him as directly responsible for the riot through her work on the Jan. 6 House panel.\n\n\n\nAfter the FBI and DOJ searched Trump’s Florida home on Aug. 8, the former president has repeatedly lambasted the agencies as pursuing its investigation for political purposes.\n\n\n\nAgents recovered some 33 boxes containing more than 100 classified records during the search, which took place in connection with the DOJ's investigation into whether Trump violated the Espionage Act and two other federal statutes.\n\n\n\n“The FBI and the Justice Department have become vicious monsters, controlled by radical left scoundrels lawyers and the media who tell them what to do—you people right there—and when to do it,” Trump said at Saturday’s rally.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe intelligence community has warned of increased threats to federal law enforcement in the wake of Trump and his allies’ attacks on the FBI and DOJ.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLofgren on CNN referenced an armed man who attempted to breach the FBI’s Cincinnati field office last month. Officials have also arrested other individuals who they say made threats following the search.\n\n\n\n“This is not responsible and the ex-president ought to stop it,” Lofgren said on CNN. “But meanwhile all of us, Democrats and Republicans, in elected office should call this out. This is not proper behavior.”",

        "description": "A boy who went viral for his effusive praise of corn was invited to South Dakota’s “Corn Palace” and named the state’s official “Corn-Bassador” over the weekend. \n\n\n\nThe state’s Department of Tourism welcomed “Corn Kid” Tariq — whose commentary on corn in a Recess Therapy video was turned into a viral TikTok audio — to “the World’s Only Corn Palace” in Mitchell, South Dakota.\n\n\n\nIn the viral video, 7-year-old Tariq says that when he tried corn with butter, \"everything changed.” \n\n\n\nHe famously described the vegetable as “a big lump with knobs” and juice. “I can’t imagine a more beautiful thing,” Tariq said in the interview.\n\n\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) issued a proclamation rife with puns and references to Tariq’s viral video — declaring Sept. 3 as \"Official Corn-bassador Tariq Day.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“South Dakota is one of the top corn producers in the nation, providing nourishment to people across the globe but especially to Tariq, a 7-year-old boy who recently discovered that corn was real,” Noem noted in her declaration.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Since being told that corn was real, Tariq believes wholeheartedly it tastes good, especially with butter; and… Tariq’s determination that corn is “awesome” and “a big lump with knobs (and) juice” has led him to be unable to imagine a more beautiful thing.”\n\n\n\nPer local media, Tariq will also receive a scholarship to learn about South Dakota's agrotourism industry.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3629148-how-labeling-dumbs-down-american-politics/",
        "description": "There was a time not long ago when the labels we assigned politicians meant something. Moderate, liberal, Democrat, Republican, conservative—these descriptors generally reflected some underlying truth. No longer. Today, labels assigned to public officials—RINO, MAGA, socialist, “true” conservative, “sem-fascist”—often have no bearing on what anyone actually believes. And that dissonance, amplified by social media, has dumbed down the public dialogue. Labeling in politics is now something akin to cussing in an argument—we resort to it to distract from the issues at hand. And that’s a shame.\n\n\n\nI can attest to the new power and the utter distortion of labeling because I saw the shift first hand. By the time I had been elected governor of North Carolina in 2012, my approach to governing was well-established. I’d been a Republican mayor of a Democratic city, Charlotte, for 14 years. And I decided to take the same approach to the governor’s mansion—a principled conservative who was also pragmatic and believed in bipartisan collaboration—that I’d employed as mayor. Working with the legislature, I both cut taxes and invested in the state’s universities and community colleges. I paid off over $2 billion in debt, balanced the budget, and still gave teachers a raise.\n\n\n\nBut then two things happened. First, I signed a bill designed primarily to overturn a local law that dictated to private businesses how they needed to handle who went in which bathroom—a choice I thought the businesses should get to decide for themselves. Suddenly people who weren’t paying close attention decided that meant I was “transphobic.” And so, after decades working with Democrats and Republican alike, I was reduced in the public’s mind to being little more than a “radical right-winger.”\n\n\n\nThen, earlier this year, while running for the U.S. Senate, I was assigned a different label altogether—one coined by none other than the former president, Donald Trump. Endorsing my primary opponent, the former president called me a Republican in Name Only (a “RINO”), suggesting to the state’s Republican electorate I “didn’t represent ‘our’ values.”\n\n\n\nSo the same person who just a few years earlier had been deemed too conservative to serve as the state’s governor was now deemed to be too moderate to be one of the state’s U.S. senators. It didn’t make any sense. I’d served in government for decades. I’d taken positions on dozens of issues. But my record didn’t matter a lick. Rather than take issue with my ideas, my opponents took turns canceling me by saying I was just “one of them”—whomever the “them” was in any given moment. And the same thing is happening everywhere in our politics.\n\n\n\nRep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.), for example, may not be a Trump supporter—but she’s&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;not a RINO. Nevertheless, she lost a bid for reelection to another Republican. And among the Democrats, Oregon’s Rep. Kurt Schraeder might have been a bulwark for bipartisanship, but he was hardly a traitor to his party, as evidenced by the fact that President Biden endorsed him for reelection. Nevertheless, after being accused of being less than a true progressive, he was ousted in a primary early this year.\n\n\n\nGeorge Carlin had an old bit that I believe speaks to this moment. He said, “I love individuals. I hate groups of people. I hate a group of people with a 'common purpose'. 'Cause pretty soon they have little hats. And armbands. And fight songs. And a list of people they're going to visit at 3am.” And that’s exactly what labeling does in our politics. It posits that people are just mindless followers of some ideology, incapable of thinking for themselves, or defining themselves apart from a broader class of people.\n\n\n\nThe problem here isn’t that labels are bad in and of themselves—short descriptors have long played a role in defining candidates for office. The real issue is twofold. First, today’s labels have no real grounding in reality, and yet they stick today in ways that they did not before. A single viral post distorting a public official’s record with an inappropriate label can define a campaign. Calling a principled conservative a RINO can undermine their career. And “cancelling” someone over not being 100 percent aligned on every issue is a big problem.\n\n\n\nPerhaps of more concern, labeling has come to distort the incentives that define public service. To avoid being labeled, officials are now afraid of doing what they think is in the public’s best interest. Even if the general electorate is eager for them to reach across the aisle, principled conservatives and principled liberals will avoid doing so for fear of being labeled a RINO or a DINO. And that shift is sure to burnish the entrenched notion that our politics is becoming increasingly disconnected from the problem-solving approach the electorate demands and, quite frankly, the country needs.\n\n\n\nPat McCrory served as governor of North Carolina from 2012-2016.",

        "description": "Web security firm Cloudfare on Saturday dropped services for stalking website Kiwifarms, citing an \"threat to human life\" posed by the social media platform's users.\n\n\n\nFor the past few weeks, Cloudfare has faced calls from transgender rights activists to shut down the website, which they say gives a platform for users who are harassing, doxxing and threatening the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Matthew Prince, a co-founder and CEO of Cloudfare, defended the firm's decision to continue defending controversial websites. \n\n\n\nHowever, on Sunday, Prince said in a blog post that visitors who navigate onto Kiwifarms will now see a popup blocking access, with a link to his post.\n\n\n\nPrince said the website was hosting \"revolting content\" that escalated into \"potential criminal acts and imminent threats to human life.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is an extraordinary decision for us to make and, given Cloudflare's role as an Internet infrastructure provider, a dangerous one that we are not comfortable with,\" he wrote, saying he had to shut down the website even after working with law enforcement.\n\n\n\n\"The rhetoric on the Kiwifarms site and specific, targeted threats have escalated over the last 48 hours to the point that we believe there is an unprecedented emergency and immediate threat to human life unlike we have previously seen from Kiwifarms or any other customer before,\" Prince added.\n\n\n\nClara Sorrenti, a Twitch streamer behind the \"DropKiwifarms\" campaign, said the far-right platform is \"falling to pieces as we speak.\"\n\n\n\n\"Just now they have been able to get the website up, but now it’s on the dark web,\" Sorrenti tweeted Sunday afternoon. \"Less than 1% of users will come over now that it’s incredibly inaccessible. This is a huge win.\"\n\n\n\nSorrenti began her campaign after Kiwifarms users made threats against her life, leaked sexually explicit photos of her and even doxxed her — or released information about her online. \n\n\n\nCloudfare is used by more than 20 percent of the entire internet for its web security services. The company protects customer's websites online, usually against distributed denial of service (DDoS) cyberattacks, which can shut down a website by flooding it with fake traffic.\n\n\n\nKiwifarms, which evolved from a Wiki site in 2008, is a chat platform where users communicate on threads. Most of the site is used to specifically target and harass online figures, especially the transgender community.\n\n\n\nAccording to Sorrenti, who has kept track of harassed targets, users have been known to record “Kill Counts” — targets who committed suicide — in their profile bios.\n\n\n\nCloudfare has twice before dropped services for customers it deemed in violation of its policies.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Cloudfare dropped support for The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website. In 2019 they halted services for the conspiracy social platform 8chan, which has been used by mass shooters to post manifestos or screeds, including the El Paso, Texas, shooter in August 2019.\n\n\n\nHowever, both websites found other internet infrastructure that allowed them to come back online. The same could be true for Kiwifarms, Prince wrote in his blog.\n\n\n\n\"We recognize that while our blocking Kiwifarms temporarily addresses the situation, it by no means solves the underlying problem. That solution will require much more work across society,\" he wrote.",

I’m still ambushed every time I hear it.\n\nLong Read of the Day\n Why the Tory project is bust\nPerceptive essay from by playwright David Hare that was written in 2016. He starts with his early play, Knuckle:\n\nKnuckle was a youthful pastiche of an American thriller, relocating the myth of the hard-boiled private eye incongruously into the home counties. Curly Delafield, a young arms dealer, returns to Guildford in order to try and find his sister Sarah who has disappeared. But in the process he finds himself freshly infuriated by the civilised hypocrisy of his father Patrick Delafield, a stockbroker of the old school. In the play father and son represent two contrasting strands in conservatism. Patrick, the father, is cultured, quiet and responsible. Curly, the son, is aggressive, buccaneering and loud. One of them sees the creation of wealth as a mature duty to be discharged for the benefit of the whole community, with the aim of perpetuating a way of life that has its own distinctive character and tradition. But the other character, based on various criminal or near-criminal racketeers who were beginning to play a more prominent role in British finance in the 1970s, sees such thinking as outdated. Curly’s own preference is to make as much money as he can in as many fields as he can and then to get out fast.\n\nBut then comes the punch that knocked me out.\n\nThe first thing to notice about my play is that it was written in 1973. Margaret Thatcher was not elected until six years later. So whatever the impact of her arrival at the end of decade, it would be wrong to say that she brought anything very new to a Tory schism that had been latent for years…\n\nIt’s a great, impassioned, prescient essay. Do give it your time.\n(I’ve always thought that it was wrong to regard Thatcher and Ronald Reagan as prime movers of the neoliberal turn. I saw both of them as just cheerleaders for a wave that was already breaking. I still think this was true for Thatcher, but having read Gary Gerstle’s magnificent Rise and Fall of the Neoliberal Order I’ve come to think that Reagan really was a prime mover.)\n\nHow tech firms can penalise the innocent\nYesterday&#8217;s Observer column:\n\nHere’s a hypothetical scenario. You’re the parent of a toddler, a little boy. His penis has become swollen because of an infection and it’s hurting him. You phone the GP’s surgery and eventually get through to the practice’s nurse. The nurse suggests you take a photograph of the affected area and email it so that she can consult one of the doctors.\nSo you get out your Samsung phone, take a couple of pictures and send them off. A short time later, the nurse phones to say that the GP has prescribed some antibiotics that you can pick up from the surgery’s pharmacy. You drive there, pick them up and in a few hours the swelling starts to reduce and your lad is perking up. Panic over.\nTwo days later, you find a message from Google on your phone. Your account has been disabled because of “harmful content” that was “a severe violation of Google’s policies and might be illegal”&#8230;\n\nRead on\n\nMy commonplace booklet\nLovely blog post by Quentin (Whom God Preserve) about a misguided road sign he noticed in Hay-on-Wye.\n\nThis Blog is also available as a daily email.

        "description": "Photo by Norm Hall/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Offense managed only three hits and was one out away from being shut out. Box Score\nIt was one of those games where the Brewers just didn’t have anything go well. The offense was quiet while the Diamondbacks put together a stellar pitching performance and strong offensive day. The result was a 5-1 loss as the Brewers drop 3 of 4 to the Diamondbacks.\nRowdy Tellez had a single in the first but that was all for the offense, while Josh Rojas of the Diamondbacks drew a walk but they also had nothing else. In the second, Keston Hiura drew a walk but was stranded. Meanwhile, the Diamondbacks manufactured a run with a Corbin Carroll walk, Carson Kelly single (that moved Carroll to third), and an Alek Thomas sacrifice fly. With that, the Diamondbacks had an early 1-0 lead.\nThe Brewers went down in order in the third. Daulton Varsho extended the Diamondbacks lead in the bottom of the inning with a leadoff home run, extending their to 2-0. Hunter Renfroe singled in the fourth, but that would be the Brewers last baserunner for a while. The Diamondbacks, led by starting pitcher Zac Gallen, retired the next 11 Brewers in a row, and 17 of the 19 that the Brewers sent to the plate between then and the end of the game. Gallen pitched seven scoreless innings, just allowing those two singles and a walk while adding seven strikeouts.\nJason Alexander started again for the Brewers and didn’t let the game get out of hand, but that’s about it. In addition to the two runs in the second and third, he was charged with a third run that the Diamondbacks managed to put together in the fifth inning. The Diamondbacks had two singles and a walk off Alexander that inning, though one was erased on a strikeout-caught stealing double play. Hoby Milner finished the fifth but allowed a single that scored a run, putting the Diamondbacks up 3-0. Alexander finished the day with 4.2 IP, three runs, five hits, four walks, and three strikeouts.\nHoby Milner also pitched the sixth and had a scoreless inning, finishing the day with three strikeouts. Matt Bush took the seventh and added two strikeouts in a scoreless inning. Brent Suter took the eighth, and he promptly started by allowing a walk and then a two-run home run to Jake McCarthy that basically put the game out of reach at 5-0.\nThe game was on its way to being another shutout for the Brewers offense, but with two outs in the ninth, Hunter Renfroe hit a solo home run to put a single run on the board for the Brewers. That at least erased a shutout, but it still ended as a 5-1 loss. Renfroe was the only Brewer that reached base multiple times (two hits), and Rowdy Tellez added the only other hit for the offense. Hiura had a walk, and Victor Caratini reached base once on a hit by pitch.\nWith the loss, the division falls further and further out of sight as the Brewers are now 8 1⁄2 games behind the Cardinals. They still remain in the Wild Card picture, mostly thanks to the Phillies and Padres not getting hot. However, the Brewers are running out of time if they want to make it into the playoffs this year, and these Diamondbacks will be the Brewers last opponent of the regular season.\nThe Brewers head to Colorado next for a three-game series. Adrian Houser returns to the rotation and will face Ryan Feltner in game one of the series. It’s a Labor Day matinee with first pitch at 3:10 PM, and will be on Bally Sports Wisconsin and the Brewers Radio Network.",

        "description": "Photo by Meg Oliphant/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Behind a five-run inning, Houston pounded hard the Halos at Angel Stadium. The Astros finished the weekend in a winning fashion. On Sunday afternoon, in the final contest of a three-game series, Houston got a 9-1 win against the Angels with help from José Urquidy and big hits from its offense, who scored nine times for the first time since August 18 (21-5 vs White Sox).\nMaking his 25th start of the campaign, Urquidy threw seven shutout innings, allowed four hits, gave up a walk, and fanned eight hitters. Urquidy’s record improved to 13-5 with a 3.51 ERA. He also set a new career-high for pitches thrown today – this time, his pitch count got to 111 (73 strikes).\nUrquidy’s gone at least seven innings in four of his most recent six starts after pitching seven innings or more only twice in his first 19 outings of 2022. At this point, he seems to continue building up his stamina and going longer in games.\nThe 27-year-old was backed up by a five-run second inning that began with a two-run home run from Kyle Tucker (23), just his second in his last 19 games. Then, David Hensley hit a two-run double and José Altuve registered an RBI two-bagger of his own to give the Astros an early, comfortable 5-0 lead.\n\n\nKING TUCK!   pic.twitter.com/sWsExcguhc— Houston Astros (@astros) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nTuve's got 5 on it. pic.twitter.com/5M9BmuCbu7— Houston Astros (@astros) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nWith Urquidy pitching a solid game, the game had a quick pace –it lasted only 2:43 hours— and both teams hung zeroes until the top seventh. Altuve, who went 3-for-4 with a triple shy of the cycle, blasted his 23rd bomb of the season with Mauricio Dubón on board to leave things 7-0.\n\n\nNo. 27 hits No. 23   pic.twitter.com/soL6IC5iza— Houston Astros (@astros) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nIn his last 30 games, since August 1, Altuve has 39 hits over 113 at-bats (.345) with 14 doubles, four home runs, 14 RBIs, 22 runs, 14 walks, and even five steals in as many attempts.\nAfter Urquidy’s performance was over, Brandon Bielak took the mound for the final two innings. He allowed Mike Trout’s 29th long ball of the year, but that was it. However, the Astros added two more runs thanks to a Yordan Álvarez two-run single in the ninth inning.\n\n\nMake that 11 hits today for the Astros. pic.twitter.com/yQdVHH90zw— Houston Astros (@astros) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nOn Monday, the Astros will host the Rangers for a three-game series, their final matchup against Texas in 2022. As an exclamation point, highly-touted prospect Hunter Brown, #1 in the Astros organization, will be making his MLB debut as the Astros’ starter against left-hander Martín Pérez.\nVIDEOS AND BOX SCORE HERE.",

        "description": "REGINA, Saskatchewan (AP) — A series of stabbings in two communities in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan left 10 people dead and 15 wounded, authorities said Sunday. Police are looking for two suspects.\n\n\n\nThe stabbings took place in multiple locations on the James Smith Cree Nation and in the village of Weldon, northeast of Saskatoon, police said.\n\n\n\nRhonda Blackmore, the Assistant Commissioner of the RCMP Saskatchewan, said some of the victims appear to have been targeted by the suspects but others appear to have been attacked at random. She couldn't provide a motive.\n\n\n\n\"It is horrific what has occurred in our province today,” Blackmore said.\n\n\n\nShe said there are 13 crime scenes where either deceased or injured people were found. She urged the suspects to turn themselves in.\n\n\n\nPolice said the last information they had from the public was that the suspects were sighted in Saskatchewan's capital of Regina around lunchtime. There have been so sightings since.\n\n\n\n“If in the Regina area, take precautions &amp; consider sheltering in place. Do not leave a secure location. DO NOT APPROACH suspicious persons. Do not pick up hitch hikers. Report suspicious persons, emergencies or info to 9-1-1. Do not disclose police locations,” the RCMP said in a message on Twitter.\n\n\n\nWeldon resident Diane Shier said she was in her garden Sunday morning when she noticed emergency crews a couple of blocks away.\n\n\n\nShier said her neighbor, a man who lived with his grandson, was killed. She did not want to identify the victim out of respect for his family.\n\n\n\n\"I am very upset because I lost a good neighbor,” she said.\n\n\n\nThe search for suspects was carried out as fans descended in Regina for a sold out annual Labor Day game between the Canadian Football League’s Saskatchewan Roughriders and Winnipeg Blue Bombers.\n\n\n\nThe Regina Police Service said in a news release that with the help of Mounties, it was working on several fronts to locate and arrest the suspects and had \"deployed additional resources for public safety throughout the city, including the football game at Mosaic Stadium.″\n\n\n\nThe alert first issued by Melfort, Saskatchewan RCMP about 7 a.m. was extended hours later to cover Manitoba and Alberta, as the two suspects remained at large.\n\n\n\nDamien Sanderson, 31, was described as five feet seven inches tall and 155 pounds, and Myles Sanderson, 30, as six-foot-one and 200 pounds. Both have black hair and brown eyes and may be driving a black Nissan Rogue.\n\n\n\nThe Saskatchewan Health Authority said multiple patients were being treated at several sites.\n\n\n\n“A call for additional staff was issued to respond to the influx of casualties,” authority spokeswoman Anne Linemann said in an email.\n\n\n\nMark Oddan, a spokesman with STARS Air Ambulance, said two helicopters were dispatched from Saskatoon and another from Regina.\n\n\n\nHe said two carried patients to the Royal University Hospital in Saskatoon, while the third carried a patient to Royal University from a hospital in Melfort, a short distance southeast of Weldon.\n\n\n\nOddan said due to privacy laws, he could not disclose information about their ages, genders or conditions.",

        "description": "History says the premiers are unlikely to come from outside the top four but the tale of the tape can only tell so muchIt won’t be lost on the Sydney Roosters that winning a premiership from outside the top four is about as likely as cracking a double-yolked egg. An exaggeration, perhaps, but the odds are not good. In the 113 years since 1908, 111 champions finished inside the four – Brisbane claimed the title from fifth in 1993 and the Bulldogs from sixth in 1995.Still, there’s something brewing in Bondi. The Roosters, who finished sixth on the ladder, are on the longest winning streak of any team entering the finals. The last match they lost was to Penrith at the start of July. The combined scoreline of the eight games since is 298-118. Of course, nothing is guaranteed against a team like South Sydney, who outscored Trent Robinson’s side in the last three quarters of Friday night’s final regular-season round but lost 26-16 anyway after shipping 14 points in the first 20 minutes. Nothing like an elimination-final rematch between old enemies to sort it out. Continue reading...",

        "description": "At pretty much the dawn of Mike Kreevich’s career, he went two-bagger crazy.\n    \n\n  Eight RBIs for Robin, seven for José — and four doubles for Kreevich 1937\nMike Kreevich tied the MLB record, with four doubles in a 9-1 win at Detroit. The center fielder’s 4-for-6 day moves his batting average up to .318. In his second season as a regular, the 29-year-old put up 3.9 rWAR, what would hold up as his career best. Interestingly, Kreevich would tally “just” 29 doubles in 1937 — making this day’s output about 14% of his season total — but led the AL with 16 triples. \nKreevich finished 1937 with a .302/.350/.468 slash and ended up 10th in MVP voting.\n\n1960\nA viral infection knocked Nellie Fox out of the lineup for the first time since August 1955. He played in 798 consecutive games, still the White Sox record — and 1,072 out of 1,073.\n\n1961\nIt was a strange start to a good White Sox career for pitcher Joe Horlen. Horlen entered a game in Minnesota wearing a blank jersey. That’s right … no name or number on the back! As Horlen was warming up, Twins manager and former Sox outfielder Sam Mele came out to talk to the umpire, basically wondering who that kid was on the mound! \nJoe allowed two hits in four innings of work, and got the 9-5 win in an unusual major league debut! \n\n1995\nRobin Ventura hit a pair of grand slams in a 14-3 win over Texas. Ventura was the eighth player in history at the time to hit a pair in one game. His eight RBIs tied the franchise record.\n\n2016\nIn a wild slugfest in Minnesota, won by the White Sox, 13-11, first baseman José Abreu drove in seven runs. José had a pair of three-run home runs in the game, along with an RBI single. The home runs came in the first and seventh innings. The seven RBIs are one off the franchise record for a single game.",

        "description": "The White Sox scored one run today, and this wasn’t one of them. | David Banks-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  South Siders drop finale to Minny before moving on to a pivotal series in Seattle Baseball giveth, and baseball taketh away. \nThe holiday weekend began with two thrilling wins over the division rival Minnesota Twins. Still, the Chicago White Sox could not complete the sweep, losing today’s finale by a final score of 5-1. The Sox fall to 67-67, returning to the .500 mark like that ex you keep finding your way back to even though you know they’ll just break your heart.\nTaking two of three from the second-place Twins is great, but this loss still stings. Not because the White Sox had to sweep; it’s hard to take three in a row from anyone, anywhere. Not because it was a horrible loss, because it wasn’t. We have seen much worse. (Hell, we don’t even need to go back too far to find a more gut-wrenching loss — need I remind you of the extra-inning, Adam Eaton dropped pop-up fiasco in August 25’s loss to Baltimore? Yeah. Yikes.) \nIt was because this game was very, very winnable. There wasn’t one glaring mistake that I could point to and say, “THAT’S why they lost!” It was a lot of little decisions and plays that didn’t break in Chicago’s favor. It was the failure to execute the safety squeeze. It was stabbing at a lazy slider with a runner on third. It was letting the second-tier bullpen guys eat it in the late innings. \nThis game was death by a thousand little paper cuts. \nThings started well — defensively. The guys were throwing some leather in the early innings. Leury García made not one but two outstanding catches on pop-ups in shallow left field that Andrew Vaughn had zero chance of making. And the only actual outfielder we started in the outfield today, AJ Pollock, robbed Gio Urshela of a hit in the second inning.  \n\n\n\n\nLucas Giolito was solid in his start, going five innings and striking out five. His first three innings were great, with his curveball looking sexy. He had a rough fourth, but kept the Twins off of the board. Then, in the fifth, he made one mistake to Carlos Correra, and that was it. \n\n\n\n\nGiolito’s record falls to 10-9, but he improved his ERA to 5.21. So, he has that going for him, at least, which is nice.\n\n\n\n\nWhat wasn’t nice today was the offense. The White Sox were, once again, faced with a lukewarm opponent in Dylan Bundy and couldn’t do a thing with him. Bundy allowed only two hits all afternoon. It was only after Bundy had left the game that the White Sox were able to make any progress at all, with an RBI double from Pollock in the seventh inning.\n\n\n\n\nIt was the only action the otherwise flaccid offense would see all day. The White Sox attempted a squeeze play to score the tying run, but Leury Legend laid down probably the worst-placed bunt of all time, and it was an effortless out at the plate for Jhoan Duran and the Twins.\nAfter the Twins scored a crucial insurance run on a wild pitch from Jake Diekman, things just kind of sputtered out. With the offense unable to produce, a two-run lead must have felt insurmountable for the White Sox. Maybe that’s why we saw Vince Velasquez in the ninth inning and let him wear it as he gave up an additional three runs, including one scored by old friend Billy Hamilton. (Et tu, Billy?)\nAlthough today’s loss bums me out, I haven’t lost all hope. Right now, all eyes are on the Cleveland Guardians, who are currently losing to the Seattle Mariners and in a delay. A Cleveland loss would go a long way in taking the sting out of today’s game. Starting tomorrow, the White Sox will begin a pivotal series against those same Mariners. \nThe White Sox hold their destiny and their season is in their own hands. It’ll be interesting to watch, and I stand, as ever, ready to get my heart broken again.\n\nToday’s scorecard highlights:\nIn the second inning, Gio’s curveball was looking tasty and AJ was makin’ plays in center. Life was good.\n  \n        \n      The cuuuuuurve/YEAH!\n  \nExcept when it wasn’t. Andrew Vaughn looked pretty bad in left field today, especially on this play that put Kyle Garlick on third base.\n  \n        \n      Terrible.\n  \nWhere’d you learn how to bunt, Leury? \n  \n        \n      Damn it.\n  \nSox lose. Whomp whooommmp.\n  \n        \n      (Sad trombone music)",

        "description": "Former President Trump on Sunday accused Fox News of pushing a Democratic agenda while offering to help rival network CNN become a \"gold mine\" by going conservative.\n\n\n\n“Wow! Fox News is really pushing the Democrats and the Democrat agenda,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Gets worse every single day. So many Dems interviewed with only softball questions, then Republican counterparts get creamed.”\n\n\n\nTrump, a regular cable news watcher, often appeared on and praised Fox News during his time in the White House, but the dynamic between the former president and the network has shifted in recent months.\n\n\n\nThe former president proceeded in Sunday's post to mention CNN, a rival to Fox that Trump has long described as fake news.\"If 'low ratings' CNN ever went conservative, they would be an absolute gold mine, and I would help them do so,\" Trump wrote.The Hill has reached out to CNN and Fox News for comment.\n\n\n\nNewly-minted CNN President Chris Licht has promised the network will renew its commitment to objectivity and fairness after accusations from the right about the network’s partisan slant and sensationalism.\n\n\n\nCNN White House correspondent John Harwood and “Reliable Sources” host Brian Stelter have departed from CNN in recent weeks, both seen as part of an effort to be less confrontational politically.\n\n\n\nIn his Sunday post, Trump specifically lashed out at Fox News contributor Karl Rove, who has criticized Trump during recent appearances.\n\n\n\nRove, who was a senior adviser to former President George W. Bush, has criticized Trump over his handling of classified information in the wake of the FBI’s search of his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, saying he had “no legal authority” to hold onto presidential records.\n\n\n\n“RINO Karl Rove is unwatchable, very negative, and on all the time - has a big record of losing!” Trump wrote.Others on the network have questioned Trump over the documents. Host Steve Doocy late last month asked why the former president had “secret stuff” recovered in the FBI search.",

        "description": "Photographs by Carol Tannenhauser.\nBy Carol Tannenhauser\nOn Sunday around 6:50 PM, a taxi cab, reportedly traveling west at high speed, clipped two parked cars on West 75th Street between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue, then flipped over.\nThe cab driver suffered injuries that did not appear to be serious, according to a Central Park emergency medical worker. There was a passenger, a police officer told the Rag, but he took off. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t want to get involved with EMS.&#8221;\n\nA crowd gathered and stared in amazement at the upside-down car. &#8220;It&#8217;s like a movie,&#8221; someone said. The mood was upbeat as no one was seriously hurt, and it was a beautiful, breezy night before a holiday.\n\nThe man whose car was hit by the cab said, &#8220;He came flying down the street at 100 miles an hour! I was just turning the wheel to pull out when he hit me, hit the car in front of me, and flipped over. I can&#8217;t believe it. I haven&#8217;t taken this car out of the garage in 22 years!&#8221; It was a &#8220;BMW M4, 2000,&#8221; he said. His phone rang. &#8220;They wasted my M4,&#8221; he told someone.\n\nA police emergency vehicle arrived around 6:20pm and, using chains, they dragged the taxi, wheels up, down 75th Street into the middle of Central Park West. Then, again using chains, to the oohs and ahs of the crowd, they flipped it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cab driver was taken to Mt. Sinai Morningside. The BMW was pushed back to the curb.",

        "description": "The Angels announced a trade with the Brewers today, acquiring right-hander Nash Walters in exchange for cash considerations. Walters has been selected to the 40-man roster and optioned to Triple-A Salt Lake. To make room on the roster, left-hander Jhonathan Diaz was recalled from Salt Lake and placed on the 60-day injured list. Walters was eligible to be traded after the deadline because he had not been on a 40-man roster or been on the Major League injured list all year.\nWalters, 25, lands on an MLB roster for the first time, but it hasn&#8217;t been an easy ride. He was a third-round selection of the Brewers, getting scooped up 90th overall in 2015 out of Lindale High School in Lindale, Texas. After getting drafted, he pitched in rookie ball in 2015 and again in 2016, but he had his progress paused by Tommy John surgery in 2017. He returned to the mound in 2019, throwing 50 1/3 innings in rookie ball, but then the pandemic wiped out the 2020 season for minor leaguers.\nLast year, Walters was able to throw 60 1/3 innings out of the bullpen of the High-A Wisconsin Timber Rattlers. He put up a 4.33 ERA along with a 29.9% strikeout rate and 41.3% ground ball rate. The 10.6% walk rate was definitely on the high side, though it was an improvement over his rookie ball days. Here in 2022, he&#8217;s split his time between Double-A and Triple-A, throwing 48 1/3 innings with a 4.47 ERA, 32.2% strikeout rate and 7.3% walk rate. A 62.3% strand rate is likely making that ERA look worse than it should be, given that the MLB league average is 72.4%.\nAs for Diaz, 25, he&#8217;s been optioned and recalled for much of the season, splitting his time between the Angels and the Bees. He last pitched in Triple-A on July 16. He has a 2.93 ERA this year in 15 1/3 MLB innings and a 4.98 ERA in 47 Triple-A innings.",

        "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russia is using a “nuclear weapon” by occupying Europe’s largest power plant, where ongoing conflict has heightened international concern about potential nuclear accident.  \n\n\n\nRussia’s military presence at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, Zelensky said, is tantamount to Russia  occupying “six Chernobyls,” referring to the site of a 1986 nuclear meltdown in Ukraine under the former Soviet Union. \n\n\n\n“You see, they occupied our nuclear station, six blocks. The biggest in Europe,\" Zelensky told ABC \"World News Tonight\" anchor David Muir in an interview excerpt shared Sunday.\n\n\n\n\"It means the biggest danger in Europe. So, they occupied it. So that is — means that they use nuclear weapon. That is [a] nuclear weapon.\"\n\n\n\nRussia has controlled the area where the Zaporizhzhya is located since early in the war, though Ukrainian workers still operate the plant.\n\n\n\n\"There shouldn't be any military personnel. There shouldn't be any military equipment on the territory. And there shouldn't be the workers of nuclear power plant who are surrounded by people with firearms,\" Zelensky said in the interview.\n\n\n\nThe two countries have blamed each other for recent shelling around the plant. Ukraine says the strikes have damaged the facilities, and Zelensky last month called the strikes “Russian nuclear terror.”\n\n\n\nAmid growing fears of potential disaster, a mission from the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency traveled to Zaporizhzhya last week and learned that the plant was disconnected from its last operational external power line.\n\n\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told reporters at the plant Thursday that it is \"obvious that the plant, and&nbsp;the physical integrity of the plant has been violated, several times,\" per a U.N. update.&nbsp;",

        "description": "SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Chileans appeared set to reject a new constitution to replace a charter imposed by the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet 41 years ago, a decision that would deal a stinging setback to President Gabriel Boric who argued the document would usher in a new progressive era.\n\n\n\nWith 72% of the votes counted in Sunday's plebiscite, the rejection camp had 62.2% support compared to 37.8% for approval amid what appeared to be a heavy turnout with long lines at polling states. Voting was mandatory.\n\n\n\n“Today we’re consolidating a great majority of Chileans who saw rejection as a path of hope,” said Carlos Salinas, a spokesman for the Citizens’ House for Rejection. “We want to tell the government of President Gabriel Boric, who during the campaign played his hand in favor of approval, that 'today you must be the president of all Chileans and together we must move forward.”\n\n\n\nThe rejection of the document was broadly expected in this country of 19 million as months of pre-election polling had shown Chileans had grown wary of the document that was written up by a constituent assembly in which a majority of delegates were not affiliated with a political party.\n\n\n\nDespite these general expectations, no analyst or pollster predicted such a large margin for the rejection camp, showing how Chileans were not ready to support a charter that would have been one of the most progressive in the world and would have fundamentally change the South American country of 19 million people.\n\n\n\nThe proposed charter was the first in the world to be written by a convention split equally between male and female delegates, but critics said it was too long, lacked clarity and went too far in some of its measures, which included characterizing Chile as a plurinational state, establish autonomous Indigenous territories, and prioritize the environment.\n\n\n\n“The constitution that was written now leans too far to one side and does not have the vision of all Chileans,” Roberto Briones, 41, said after voting in Chile's capital of Santiago. “We all want a new constitution, but it needs to have a better structure.”\n\n\n\nThe result deals a major blow to Boric, who at 36 is Chile’s youngest-ever president. He had tied his fortunes so closely to the new document that analysts said it was likely some voters saw the plebiscite as a referendum on his government at a time when his approval ratings have been plunging since he took office in March.\n\n\n\nWhat happens now amounts to a big question mark. Chilean society at large, and political leadership of all stripes, have agreed the constitution that dates from the country’s 1973-1990 dictatorship must change. The process that will be chosen to write up a new proposal still has to be determined and will likely be the subject of hard-fought negotiations between the country’s political leadership.\n\n\n\nBoric has called on the heads of all political parties for a meeting tomorrow to determine the path forward.\n\n\n\nThe vote marked the climax of a three-year process that began when the country once seen as a paragon of stability in the region exploded in student-led street protests in 2019. The unrest was sparked by a hike in public transportation prices, but it quickly expanded into broader demands for greater equality and more social protections.\n\n\n\nThe following year, just under 80% of Chileans voted in favor of changing the country’s constitution. Then in 2021, they elected delegates to a constitutional convention.\n\n\n\nThe 388-article proposed charter sought to put a focus on social issues and gender parity, enshrined rights for the country’s Indigenous population and put the environment and climate change center stage in a country that is the world’s top copper producer. It also introduced rights to free education, health care and housing.\n\n\n\nThe new constitution would have established autonomous Indigenous territories and recognized a parallel justice system in those areas, although lawmakers would decide how far-reaching that would be.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, the current constitution is a market-friendly document that favors the private sector over the state in aspects like education, pensions and health care. It also makes no reference to the country’s Indigenous population, which makes up almost 13% of the population.",

        "description": "Informally speaking, I want to compare two gardens. One is the Japanese garden section of the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis. When I was a kid we called it Shaw's Garden, after the founder in the 19th century. The other is the Japanese garden section of Meier Gardens in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which I visited for the first time today.\nBoth are clearly what an American who goes to botanical gardens would call a Japanese garden. I don't know what a person from Japan would call them. There are evergreens and water features and small islands and bridges and flowering bushes that make a bold statement when they're in bloom. There are little houses styled to look Japanese, from a certain era, I assume. There are bonsai plants and raked rock gardens. Both the St. Louis and the Grand Rapids gardens have all the things a casual American would expect in a Japanese garden.\nBut they have a very different feel, for the most part. The St. Louis garden feels cultivated, arranged, perfected, serene, extravagant. So does the Grand Rapids garden, except that most things have a little bit of edge to them, a bit of wildness, a bit of tangle where the other is smooth, say.\nIt's as though you can say the same words and have them come our very differently. We have this or that expected gesture, familiar idiom, or standard ingredient, but they can be inflected, I guess, in many ways. Filled with this attitude and not that one. Expressing this kind of person and not that one. It's something to do with style, but that seems to ephemeral to fully account for it.

Even the most familiar cultural object can somehow be revoiced.\",\n            \"created\": \"Mon, 05 Sep 2022 01:19:12 GMT\",\n            \"permalink\": \"http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2022/09/04/011049.html?title=revoiced#a011912\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",

        "description": "Kevin Alcantara | Myrtle Beach Pelicans\n    \n\n  Kevin Alcantara’s grand slam propels the Pelicans past the RIverDogs. Tennessee wins a rain-shortened game. Iowa splits and South Bend is no-hit.  The Cubs today announced that first baseman Matt Mervis and right-hander Walker Powell were the Cubs’ Minor League Player and Pitcher of the Month for August.\nMervis went 25-for-82 (.305 batting average) with seven doubles and four home runs for Triple-A Iowa. His ten walks gave him a .390 on-base percentage. He finished the month with a ten-game hitting streak.\nPowell went 2-0 with a 0.44 ERA in five appearances (one start) for Double-A Tennessee. Powell struck out 21 and walked just six over 20.1 innings in August. \nTomorrow is Labor Day, which traditionally is the final day of the minor league season. But MLB blew up the traditional minor league season in 2021, so instead of being a season finale, it will be a normal Monday off-day. South Bend and Myrtle Beach have one more six-game series to go and both teams have already qualified for the playoffs. Tennessee plays two more six-game series before a possible playoff berth for them. Iowa’s regular season continues until September 28.\nIowa Cubs\nThe Iowa Cubs split a doubleheader with the Columbus Clippers (Guardians), winning game one 5-3 and dropping game two 1-0. The two teams also split the six-game series evenly with three wins each. \nCaleb Kilian started game one and allowed just one unearned run over five innings. Kilian gave up five hits and walked three. He also struck out three.\nKilian didn’t get the win because Jonathan Holder gave up the lead with two runs in the bottom of the sixth. Kervin Castro had to relieve Holder with runners on first and second and only one out. A wild pitch and a sacrifice fly off of Castro gave the Clippers a 3-2 lead, but Castro then got a ground out to end the inning. Castro would then get the win when Iowa scored three runs in the top of the seventh.\nBen Leeper pitched the bottom of the seventh and retired the side in order for his eighth save. Leeper struck out one.\nFirst baseman Matt Mervis tied the game up twice. The first time, he made it 1-1 with a home run in the third inning. That gave Mervis an even 30 home runs this year. It was his ninth with the I-Cubs. \nIn the top of the seventh, Mervis hit an RBI single that scored pinch-runner Narciso Crook, tying the game 3-3. \nMervis went 2 for 3 with a walk and two runs scored. He also extended his hitting streak to 13 games. It would end there, as Mervis went 0 for 3 in game two.\nLeft fielder Jackson Frazier hit a two-run single later in the seventh inning that ended up being the winning hit. Frazier went 1 for 4. \nThird baseman Levi Jordan went 2 for 4 and scored once.\nIn game two, Wyatt Short was the tough-luck loser, giving up just one run on three hits over four innings. Short struck out four and only walked one, although he did hit two batters.\nCenter fielder Darius Hill went 1 for 3. Along with his 1 for 4 in game one, Hill now has a hit in 17 of his past 19 games. \nHere’s Mervis’ home run in game one.\n\n\nHome run number 30 for Matt Mervis ties the game! pic.twitter.com/ed4zCRHMv7— Iowa Cubs (@IowaCubs) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nTennessee Smokies\nThe Tennessee Smokies beat the Mississippi Braves, 5-2 in a game ended by rain in the bottom of the sixth inning. Game 2 of the scheduled doubleheader was cancelled.\nThe Smokies took four of five from the M-Braves. \nBen Brown started and got the win after allowing just one run on four hits over five innings. Brown struck out six and walked two.\nDH Miguel Amaya hit a three-run home run in the top of the first inning and Tennessee never looked back. It was Amaya’s fourth home run this year and second in Double-A. He went 1 for 3.\nThird baseman Jake Slaughter went 2 for 3 and scored once.\nLeft fielder Nelson Maldonado was 2 for 3 with a double. \nSouth Bend Cubs\nThe South Bend Cubs were no-hit by the Lansing Lugnuts (Athletics), 2-1. Despite losing the final two games of the series, South Bend won the series 4 games to 2 and clinched a second-half title on Saturday. \nStarter Joe Nahas gave up a solo home run to the second batter of the game and led the rest of the game. Nahas’ final line was one run on two hits over four innings. He struck out five and walked one.\nFour Lansing pitchers combined to no-hit the SB Cubs. The Cubs did draw seven walks and Jordan Nwogu scored from second on an errant pickoff throw. Nwogu was 0 for 3 with a walk and a stolen base. \nMyrtle Beach Pelicans\nThe Myrtle Beach Pelicans put a muzzle on the Charleston RiverDogs (Rays), 9-6. The two teams split the six-game series as each team won three games. \nStarter Chase Watkins went three innings and gave up two runs on six hits. Watkins struck out three and walked one.\nBrody McCullough, the Cubs’ 2022 tenth-round pick, got his first win with the Pelicans after he gave up a run on two hits over 1.1 innings. He walked one and struck out one.\nFrankie Scalzo Jr. picked up a two-inning save tonight. Scalzo surrendered two hits but no runs. He struck out five and walked just one. Scalzo loaded the bases with just one out in the ninth before striking out the final two batters to end the game. \nCenter fielder Kevin Alcantara turned a 6-4 RiverDogs lead into an 8-6 Pelicans lead with a grand slam in the top of the eighth inning. It was Alcantara’s 14th home run this year. He went 2 for 4 with a walk. \nThird baseman James Triantos reached base all five times as he was 2 for 2 with three walks. Triantos scored one run.\nRight fielder Felix Stevens added on an insurance run with an RBI double in the top of the ninth. Stevens went 2 for 4. \nHere’s Alcantara’s slam.\n\n\nKevin Alcántara grand slam! Worked a great AB, laid off some chase pitches to make it full and then delivered. pic.twitter.com/kaJ9Zc9g6N— Brad (@ballskwok) September 4, 2022",

        "description": "Photo by Norm Hall/Getty Images\n    \n\n  A new prospect, pennant races and the closer’s spot are among the topics.  If you are interested in taking part in a round table alongside the regular writers, like Heath Klein this week, just answer one or more of the questions in the comments. I’ll select one respondee, and send them the questions so they can join in next weekend!\nRate Torey’s option being exercised on our Great/Good/Meh/Bad/Terrible scale, and explain yourself.\nISH95: I think it’s great. As I’ve said elsewhere, there isn’t a better choice out there at this point than Lovullo, so why make a change? He’s had one playoff season, one 2020, one terrible season, and two solid season, then this season that is looking to be a huge step up from last year. I don’t really get what else you would want from a manager in this day and age.\nDBacksEurope: Call me crazy for calling it “meh” but I am aware that there isn’t anything better out there. I think it was James who commented correctly that better options are not willing to manage this team. Besides, I predicted that Torey would continue if he would achieve 70 victories and, knocking wood save disaster, they are on pace to get there easily, so he definitely deserves it. And he functions well as Hazen’s puppet, not everyone is willing to do that, just read Maddon’s reactions about his time with the Angels.\nJustin: I am going with “meh” as well, for reasons previously stated by DBE. \nMakakilo:  Great!\nTorey Lovullo changed the coaching.  This is the first season with the new Diamondbacks hitting and pitching coaches.  They implemented a new system so the minors and majors use the same vocabulary and methods so that when players are promoted to the Majors, they have more success and sustained success.  The new coaching is working well.  The concept of built innings is powerful per this AZ Snake Pit article.  As talented players from a great farm system ranked 4th best in the Majors (per this AZ Snake Pit article) are called up to the Majors, I’m seeing awesome success.\nThis season’s results are better than many fans expected.  As manager Torey Lovullo was at the center of this season’s comeback.  Four points:\n\nThe Diamondbacks are on solid pace to reach 72 wins, a 20 win improvement on last season.   With 63 wins as of Saturday morning, they need 9 more wins.  After the Brewers, 9 series remain.  Therefore 1 win per series would reach 72 wins!  \nOn 3 September, the latest simulations at 538.com show the Diamondbacks winning between 76 and 86 wins.\nOn the morning of 3 September, the Diamondbacks were in third place in the NL West, a half-game ahead of the Giants. Reaching third place was unthinkable earlier in the season!\nTorey Lovullo often talked about the importance of defense.  Nearly every season the Diamondbacks had great defense.  This season, after a slow start, they achieved their norm of great defense. The Diamondbacks defense steadily improved during the season! The Diamondbacks ranking in overall defensive DRS (for the season) increased from 20th at All-Star break, to 14th on 24 July, to 11th on 12 August, to 9 th on 2 September.  I love that trend!\n\nTorey Lovullo’s strengths build on the new coaching.  Although managers are responsible for many tasks, Torey Lovullo’s wheelhouse is developing working relationships (by a combination of authentic caring, strong values, wisdom, and being a quality person) with players to achieve their best efforts, especially for younger players. \nThis season, players who made a debut in the Majors included Alec Thomas, Thomas Henry, Jose Herrera, Tyler Holton, Cooper Hummel, Buddy Kennedy, Corbin Carroll, and Stone Garrett.  Ryne Nelson is expected to make his debut on Monday.\nAll these players are younger than the average in the majors.\n\nAlek Thomas, age 22, played excellent defense in center field (6 Outs Above Average and 5 Defensive Runs Saved) and his batting is nearly league average (promising for a debut in the Majors at age 22).\nCorbin Carroll, age 22, was ranked best prospect in baseball by Keith Law at mid-season, currently ranked second-best prospect in baseball by MLB pipeline and third-best in baseball by FanGraphs with an impressive 60 FV. He is a fast runner (FV 70/70 per FanGraphs) who added much excitement in his first 3 games in the Majors.\nBuddy Kennedy, age 23 played second base in June and July and is now in AAA. His swing was ranked highly.\nTommy Henry, age 24, started 6 games in August. His 63.6 game score in his second start was excellent! This season Diamondbacks’ pitchers had reached that score in only 23 games, including his start. In the first five innings of his third start he allowed zero earned runs and only 2 hits.\nRyne Nelson, age 24.  He is a starting pitcher who pitches fastballs up in the zone.  In 2020 he did a major overhaul of his pitching method.      \nStone Garrett, age 26, is a right handed outfielder.  In his first 32 PAs in the Majors, his OPS rose from .900 in AAA to 1.138, while his homers per PA stayed about the same (.063).  Very impressive!\nTyler Holton, age 26, pitched 9 innings of relief with an ERA+ of 143.  An interesting statistic is his release point is closer to the plate than 80% of pitchers in the Majors per Baseball Savant.\nJose Herrera, age 25, played catcher in 46 games through 9 August, when he was optioned to AAA. His 0.7 throwing runs leads the Diamondbacks per Baseball Prospectus.\nCooper Hummel, age 27, mainly played left field until August, when he played 40 innings as catcher.   His 28.9 feet per second sprint speed is at the 89th percentile in the Majors per Baseball Savant.  \n\nHeath Klein: I’m leaning towards “Good”; he still makes questionable decisions at times, but with better pieces he has been doing a better job of putting guys in positions to succeed (although, I will always question the logic any time Carson sits against LHP).\nSpencer: I stuck with great. He’s shown me no real reasons to believe he’s deserving of anything less. When presented with issues he resolves them and uses the criticisms to get better (benching hot players being the most recent example).  Get him an average or better bullpen, Hazen. Get him that and I wanna see what this team with his leadership can manifest.\nDano: I, too, am pretty happy with it. It genuinely seems to be that he manages the players he’s got as best he can, and he seems to get pretty good results. Like Spencer says, give him a better bullpen, and in general fewer kinda crappy free agents he presumably then has to use, and let’s see what he can do. I think it would be pretty damn good.\nCorbin Carroll arrives. What are your expectations, hopes and fears?\nISH95: I hope he stays here for 20 years, leads us to five straight World Series, and  is the second all time unanimous inductee to the HoF. I’m afraid that he’ll join the unmeasurably long list of highly heralded prospects who just don’t pan out. I expect that he is going to be a solid to above average player for 10-15 years, with several all star appearances and finishing in the top five for MVP a couple of times, either for us or the Atlanta Braves.\nDBacksEurope: My fear for every player is an injury that hampers his development into an average player or even a star, like Marte and his hammies. I expect him to become at least an average player and I hope he is able to live up to the expectations and become an All Star. It would be terrific if he is able to perform like a 2015 Pollock consistently.\nJustin: My hope is that he stays here many years and helps us win and signs a team friendly extension. My fear would be that he ends up a total bust and in 2025 we are saying. Why were we all so excited about this kid. \nMakakilo:  I expect Corbin Carroll to impress me with his speed and defensive plays.  My hope is that he reaches the All-Star level within a couple years.  My worst fear is that he gets injured and it delays his continued development.\nHeath Klein: I’m expecting a player that’s at least average, but I must add that it’s very easy to see a reality in which he’s a consistently above average player on a rate basis. My biggest fear is missing extended time due to aggravating the shoulder (if they could hammer out a fair early extension to limit that risk to player and team, I’d be over the moon; I highly doubt it, though)\nSpencer: My hope: he becomes the regular All Star the team builds an identity around (2+ decades in and the only real identity this team has is hating that away teams’ fans outnumber us at home…). My fear: his MiLB success was primarily from playing in hitter friendly parks and he never learns to adjust to MLB pitching. \nDano: Maybe it’s burnout from my years as a Diamondbacks fan, but all prospects are lottery tickets to me until they prove otherwise. I’d like to see him succeed, and get as close to whatever his talent ceiling is as he can. I hope he doesn’t stall in his first or second full year in the majors, lose the confidence of the front office, and get dealt to some other team that knows how to develop players and winds up with a good or at least solid player for years to come (cf. Max Scherzer, Robbie Ray, Taijuan Walker, countless more I can’t even call to mind right now).\nWho, if anyone, will be the odd man out of the young outfielders?\nISH95: Probably Garrett. He just doesn’t have the pedigree of the others or the expectations behind him that the others do. But he also is exactly the kind of player that has a knack for sticking in the big leagues so we shall see.\nDBacksEurope: Cooper Hummel is one, of course. Other than that the injury and being yet another left-handed hitter will probably squeeze Pavin Smith out as well. I am with ISH on Stone Garrett’s pedigree, but he is one of few right-handed hitters in the outfield. At the beginning of the season we traded for one, so I give him a good chance of sticking if he keeps performing somewhere around league average level (not in a way he is doing now, because those numbers will drop a lot). We also have Fletcher and Canzone knocking on the 2023 MLB door, although they are both lefties as well. It looks obvious a couple of our current guys will sooner or later end up in a trade package for a pitcher. Luplow could be one if tendered, McCarthy could be another although I would hate to see him go, I like his attitude, aggressiveness and the way he plays a lot.\nJustin: Garrett\nMakakilo: In September, it’s likely all the outfielders will get playing time because the DH, a double header on the 20th, only 3 off-days, and Luplow was optioned to the minors.  DBE was correct about Cooper Hummel.  In August, his playing time was at catcher instead of the outfield, and that is likely to continue.  It’s too soon to speculate who will make next season’s roster.\nHeath Klein: if we’re talking about being squeezed out of the short-term picture? I’d definitely say Stone (but he’s also one of the better candidates for DH appearances if they stubbornly hold onto playing Marte in the field; having all of his options would also contribute to that). If we’re talking about long-term? It’s probably outlandish, but I can see Varsho getting squeezed out once the team has the luxury to look at the “shape” of production (possibly earlier than anybody anticipates) between:\n\na.) having the least amount of team control\nb.) the overemphasis on pulled balls\nc.) the lack of communication when playing COF (although, I don’t blame him too much for taking charge the way he does on gap plays; he would be the best option in CF for the majority of teams in the league, this is unfortunately not one of said teams)\n\nSpencer: I think the easy answer is Garrett; he’s always struck me as a story more than legit player for the team. But going into 2024 and beyond? When other guys could be pushing for playing time beneath them? Or when a glaring weakness (cough rotation cough bullpen cough) rears its head? I’m going to say Varsho. He needs to provide some stability with the bat to avoid becoming the first outfielder traded; his value is still high and McCarthy is looking very good in his own right. \nDano: Likely Garrett. I hope it’s not McCarthy, though I worry it might be. I love that kid.\nWho should be our 2023 closer?\nISH95: Well if the past is any indicator is going to be Josh Hader. Beyond that, I have no idea. It just had better not be anyone currently in the bullpen.\nDBacksEurope: Melancon will still be here in 2023 so I will say that he will be our closer come April. But if we wish to look for other internal options, then Joe Mantiply could be him, but Jim once wrote that you don’t want your best reliever to be the closer, so that reduces his odds. If we think our neighbour’s grass is greener than ours and Hazen sticks to his usual plan, there are a lot of interesting options in free agency this off-season: if we wish to go dumpster diving, we have Alex Colome, Carlos Estevez and Hunter Strickland. Looking at buy-low candidates we can see good ol’ Archie Bradley, but also Luke Jackson. The real big boys, led by Edwin Diaz, will obviously be out of reach for this team. But the Diamondbacks could sneak away with interesting guys like Taylor Rogers and Corey Knebel. Brad Hand could be another option. But like I said, I think Melancon will stay where he is, because I don’t see Hazen taking the risk of taking on big money in 2023 with him and MadBum around. I hope we try to get Archie Bradley back. He is still just 29 years old, coming off a disappointing season with an injury, and he was such a fun guy to have around. And he will make the bullpen better.\nJustin: No idea. Melancon will still be here, though…\nMakakilo: I’m concerned that, even with Brent Strom coaching, Melancon may not be the best choice to close in 2023. Nevertheless, I would not make a decision until spring training.\nThis season, Melancon’s pitching results declined. For an introduction, see this AZ Snake Pit article which was posted on 6 August.  The following graph shows how OBP and wOBA worsened.\n  \n        \n  \nIn August when Melancon pitched in the ninth, his OBP and wOBA were about the same as 2021, which was encouraging!  Ninth inning results were not shown in the graph.  As shown in the graph, looking at all innings in August his OBP and wOBA were worse than 2021. \nWhat happened in August?  The Diamondbacks changed to closer by committee.  Part of the better results (for Melancon in August in the ninth inning) may have been due to picking the reliever with the best matchups to the other team’s batters that day.  For a comparison of Mark Melancon, Ian Kennedy, and other relievers in August, see this AZ Snake Pit article, which will likely post on Tuesday.\nHeath Klein: I honestly don’t know who the Closer will be in ‘23, but I’m fairly confident that they’re not currently in the organization.\nSpencer: I want this. I don’t believe this will happen. Closer will be MadBum, 7th and 8th high leverage positions will be JBB and Frias who also serve as backups when Bum is tired. Melancon should be a middle inning guy, Mantiply should have a short leash after his abysmal second half and both JM and MM should be cut immediately if they can’t hack it anymore. \nDano: There’s a guy I often see hanging out by the Circle K in the afternoon. Seems able-bodied, probably pushing forty. Might be looking for work. Fits the front office profile. I think his name is Bob.\nWhat MLB races and stories will you be following over the final month?\nISH95: Call me crazy all you want, but the Diamondbacks are only five games below .500 at time of writing, and I think they have a chance. I’m very curious to see what happens. Other than that, Albert Pujols and The Quest For 700, Judge and his pursuit of Maris, and watching the Dodgers inevitably choke away one of the best regular seasons in MLB history… again.\nDBacksEurope: I am interested in the Mets. It would be a huge accomplishment and a slap in the face to my argument that money isn’t all if they keep up pace and are able to get far in the playoffs. The AL East is an exciting division to follow with the Orioles all of a sudden appearing as a Wild Card contender and the Red Sox as the worst team. The Rays beat the Yankees 9-0 this weekend. Anything can happen in the AL East.\nJustin: Pujols pursuit of 700, Judge becoming the first to hit 60+ sans asterisk since Maris, the Orioles (although I dont think they will sneak in, it would be a good story) Central division leading Cleveland is currently 1 game behind them in the loss column. \nMakakilo:  I will follow two races:   \n\nThe race to 72 wins.  The Diamondbacks need 9 more wins.  They will play 9 more series.\nThe race between the Giants and Diamondbacks for third place in NL West.  As of Saturday morning, the Diamondbacks were a half game ahead.  \n\nHeath Klein: Goldy’s outside shot at a Triple Crown is one of the main storylines I’m following outside of AZ, but E², Mad Max, and the Real Marte Parte getting a shot at deep October baseball gets me pretty hyped too (or maybe it’s just the trumpets?).\nIt goes without saying, but to what extent the DBacks can play spoilers is the primary storyline. It’s feels so long ago, but I’m fairly sure my preseason win prediction was 75, that was made without the knowledge of how large of a funeral pyre Bumgarner/Melancon would build for themselves.\nWhich is to say, that if this team wins at least 75 games (which is looking increasingly likely), it’s much more impressive and exciting than the garden-variety 75-win team. It would be nice to confirm that the light at the end of the tunnel isn’t a train before ‘22 ends.\nSpencer: As a D’Backs fan, I’ll be eagerly awaiting the 81st win to justify my highly optimistic early season estimate. But as a baseball fan, I’m rooting/following the Yankees collapse and Rays/Orioles seizing of the vacancy. I want both in the postseason (sorry Toronto but this means you likely miss again). And I’ll have an eye on the Mariners too. I want their steak to end and I think it will. \nDano: Goldy’s triple crown/MVP pursuit, definitely. Our progress through the rest of the season (I think my preseason prediction was 77-85, and we might yet get there). The crazy journey of the Seattle Mariners to what I hope is at least a wild card berth (I “predicted” them as the winners of the World Series in the preseason Round Table). Ramona and I also have a dear old friend who is a perennial Mets fan, so I’ll be rooting for them as long as they last in the postseason. \nWhat is the worst movie you’ve watched from beginning to end?\nISH95: Well I’ve watched every Marvel and DC movie ever made and at least half of those qualify. The second Fantastic Beasts movie is another strong contender. Idk, overall I tend to just avoid bad movies lol\nDBacksEurope: There are a lot, but after watching the 2021 version of “Dogtanian and the three Muskehounds” (what’s in a name, jeez…) last year with my kids in the cinema, I said out loud that it would be the last time we were going to pay to watch a (computer) animated movie in the theatre. Normally I just turn off the television or start doing something else, but being this the movie theatre I had no choice to watch, in Spanish, all of what that stupid dog achieves in no time. \nJustin: Honestly, no idea. I dont go to movie theaters, nothing to do with COVID, I just never have liked to. So, usually I am watching something on Netflix or Prime, and if I start not liking something I just find something else to watch and forget about it. \nMakakilo:  The Silent Sea (watched on the internet).  I watched to the end for two reasons:\n\nTo better understand South Korean Science Fiction.\nWith the hope that something interesting and unexpected would happen.\n\nHeath Klein: I’m not a huge movie person, so I generally don’t sit through movies that I think are terrible; HOWEVER, I did sit all the way through “Kller Raccoons 2: Dark Christmas in the Dark” (can be rented on YouTube), because my buddy Ervin made it with a college buddy during the Pandemic.\nIt was a sequel to a s****y movie that they made just out of college. Nicest guy you’d ever meet and worst movie I’ve ever seen all the way through (it was intentionally bad so that’s kind of a compliment, I guess…)\nSpencer: VelociPastor. It was/is on Prime. We’d just gotten back from the strangest wedding (it’s a story best heard in person - ask me next time we’re together), and we were DRUNK. The description: “After losing his parents, a priest travels to China, where he inherits a mysterious ability that allows him to turn into a dinosaur. At first horrified by this new power, a hooker convinces him to use it to fight crime. And ninjas.” Shout out to the Eragon adaptation from 15ish years ago - just rewatched a few weeks ago; still holds up as an awful movie!\nDano: Like many here, I’m not a huge movie person, and I don’t have much if any time or energy for hate-watching crap movies. But for some reason that must have seemed compelling at the time, my ex-wife and I one night watched Zardoz from start to finish. 1974, written and directed by John Boorman, starring Sean Connery. I recall bright maroon loincloths. Lots of bright maroon loincloths. For the love of God.",

        "description": "Ten people were killed and at least 15 wounded in series of stabbings in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan on SundayCanada mass stabbing – latest updatesReport: police say 10 killed and 15 hurt in SaskatchewanTen people were killed and at least 15 wounded in a spate of stabbings in 13 locations across an Indigenous community and a nearby village in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan on Sunday.Police first began receiving reports of stabbings around 5.40am on Sunday in the James Smith Cree Nation community. Reports of additional attacks quickly followed in the nearby village of Weldon, north-east of Saskatoon. Both communities are sparsely populated with 3,400 and 200 people respectively.At least 15 people were taken to hospital although “there may be additional injured victims who transported themselves to various hospitals”, Rhonda Blackmore, commanding officer of the Saskatchewan Royal Canadian Mounted police, said. Mark Oddan, a spokesperson with Stars air ambulance, said two helicopters were sent from Saskatoon, and another from Regina. Some of the victims appear to have been targeted but others appear to have been attacked at random, Blackmore said. She did not provide a motive.Police identified the suspects as Damien Sanderson, 31, and Myles Sanderson, 30 and asked them to turn themselves in. Both are said to have black hair and brown eyes, though the relationship between them is unclear. The pair were last sighted driving a black Nissan Rogue with licence plate 119 MPI in Saskatchewan’s capital of Regina, about 200 miles (320km) south of the attacks in the James Smith Cree Nation and the village of Weldon.Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, described the attacks as “horrific and heartbreaking” in a statement of support to the families of those killed. “The attacks in Saskatchewan today are horrific and heartbreaking. I’m thinking of those who have lost a loved one and of those who were injured,” he said in a tweet.One witness said she believed one of the suspects approached her and her daughter claiming he was hurt. Doreen Lees, 89, said she and her daughter thought they saw one of the suspects when a car came barreling down her street in Weldon early in the morning. Lees said a man approached them and said he was hurt and needed help but took off when her daughter said she would call for help. “He wouldn’t show his face. He had a big jacket over his face. We asked his name and he kind of mumbled his name twice and we still couldn’t get it,” she told the Associated Press. “He said his face was injured so bad he couldn’t show it.” She said the man was by himself and “kind of a little wobbly.”Saskatchewan’s premier, Scott Moe, also issued a statement, describing the attacks as “senseless violence”. “There are no words to adequately describe the pain and loss caused by this senseless violence. All of Saskatchewan grieves with the victims and their families,” he said.Residents of James Smith Cree Nation chronicled the events on social media. One woman posted an image of a broken door handle, adding that she was glad her younger sister wasn’t home when it was broken into. “This is forever gonna traumatize me,” she wrote. Others – including a young woman who had seen her grandfather the night before, only to learn he was a victim in the attacks – posted tributes to killed family members. Continue reading...",

        "description": "For the first time ever, high school students will have the opportunity to take an Advanced Placement course in African American Studies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe College Board introduced the pilot program earlier this year and will be implemented in 60 schools across the country for its inaugural run. However, it is unclear in which states the 60 schools are located. \n\n\n\nThough students won’t be able to receive college credit for the course this year, the College Board plans to offer the course to all interested high schools for college credit during the 2024-25 school year.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe class will be interdisciplinary, meaning students won’t just learn history but also geography, literature, art, music, politics and film to provide a comprehensive view of the African American experience.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor some, like Florida State University Schools teacher Marlon Williams-Clark, that means posing questions like “What does it mean to be Black?” to his class, which consists of mainly Black and brown students.\n\n\n\nThe exercise \"40 million ways to be Black\" became an impassioned discussion with his students, culminating in a piece by renowned scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. that declared there is no one way to be Black.\n\n\n\nFor others, like Texas high school teacher Nelva Williamson, the program means the opportunity to delve deeper into the eras of Reconstruction and the Harlem Renaissance.\n\n\n\n“In Texas, the Reconstruction Era is kind of skipped over and it's looked at through the lens of being a failure,” Williamson said. “But in my own study of Reconstruction, political strength came out of that era of time for African Americans, taking agency over not only their bodies but what they were going to do, and the development of Black towns here in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. I'm really looking forward to teaching that to give it a different spin from what our students have been told about it.”\n\n\n\nWilliamson, who has been teaching for more than four decades, said she wants the course to show that while the history of Black America isn’t always easy to hear, there was an “ascension” over the horrible things that happened, and it often came in the form of art.\n\n\n\n“I really hope [students] are able to take away a deeper understanding of the whole breadth of history that African Americans played in the central part in the development of this country,” she said. “There's harsh histories, their enslavement is something that really happened. But there is also these other things: people were enslaved or brought here forcefully, and then created a whole wonderful American culture.”\n\n\n\nWilliams-Clark said the addition of this course was a long time coming. Schools have consistently offered AP European History and AP World History, but adding AP African American Studies gave a level of “confirmation and legitimacy” to the subject, he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The right time [for this class] was when Black students were first allowed to go to school, so this is well overdue,” said Williams-Clark. “I appreciate a course like this coming into existence to give students a chance to really interact with information that many adults will tell you they never knew, because it wasn't part of the mainstream curriculum.”\n\n\n\nAnd students have jumped at the chance to take the course.\n\n\n\nWilliamson said when the class was announced at Young Women’s College Preparatory Academy, her classroom was so full it was standing-room only.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring a recent class discussion, one student excitedly asked her if these are the experiences they can look forward to in college. Even the parents of her students have become excited, telling her they’re learning at home from their students as the school year gets underway.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Williams-Clark is already thinking of an assignment that incorporates modern works like the new Black Panther movie to ask his students to identify African cultural representation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe’s also considering looking at songs like \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" or others from the Civil Rights movement and analyzing the lyrics, conducting lessons on understanding Black feminism and dissecting movies like Sidney Poitier’s \"Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.\"\n\n\n\n“To bring those 'old things' into the classroom and give it some relevance in which [students] can really analyze and connect it to the information that they're learning in the class as well as connect it to what similarities and differences in today's society is going to be really exciting for them to do,” said Williams-Clark.\n\n\n\nThe program comes at a time when education has become increasingly politicized, particularly curriculums that include issues of racial injustice and African American history.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome have argued that such a course could become a framework for educators to teach critical race theory, which posits that race and racism have been rooted in American law and institutions since slavery and Jim Crow.\n\n\n\nSince early 2021, 137 educational gag order bills have been introduced in 36 states, according to the free speech group PEN America, limiting instruction on race and LGBT history in the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBoth Florida and Texas have enacted laws limiting how race is taught in schools.\n\n\n\nIn March, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed FL H.B.7 into law, limiting lessons on topics like “white privilege.”\n\n\n\nThe law includes language stating that a person should not be instructed to “feel guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress” because of their race, color, sex or national origin.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn Texas, Senate Bill 3 passed last December, instructing teachers to “not be compelled to discuss a widely debated and currently controversial issue of public policy or social affairs.”\n\n\n\nNeither the Texas nor Florida departments of education responded when reached for comment by The Hill. \n\n\n\nThe College Board hasn’t released a syllabus or curriculum for the course, but both Williamson and Williams-Clark said their curricula do not teach critical race theory.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrevor Packer, senior vice president of AP and instruction at the College Board, told The Hill's Changing America that the class will “introduce a new generation of students to the amazingly rich cultural, artistic, and political contributions of African Americans.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe added that the College Board hopes “it will inspire students with a fuller appreciation of the American story.”\n\n\n\nFor Williamson, the debate around how — and if — to teach race is precisely why a course like the AP African American Studies class is so important.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This course comes at a time when there’s a lot of pushback against African Americans and in general people of color,” said Williamson. “There's a lot of hate out there against minority groups and the only way that we could break that cycle of hate is through education.”",

Biden on Sunday endorsed a California bill that would expand union organizing rights for agricultural workers, a measure long pushed by labor organizers who are now pressuring Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) to sign the legislation.\n\n\n\nThe bill, which state lawmakers sent to Newsom's desk last week, would allow farmworkers to choose whether they want to vote in a union election in person, by mail or by submitting a card to a California Agricultural Labor Relations Board office. “Farmworkers worked tirelessly and at great personal risk to keep food on America’s tables during the pandemic,” Biden said in the statement. “In the state with the largest population of farmworkers, the least we owe them is an easier path to make a free and fair choice to organize a union. I am grateful to California’s elected officials and union leaders for leading the way.”\n\n\n\nAdvocates say the bill, titled the Agricultural Labor Relations Voting Choice Act, would help prevent intimidation during in-person elections from management, including fears of workers’ deportation if they attempt to unionize. The legislation faces opposition from the agricultural industry.Biden in his statement did not name Newsom, who vetoed a similar bill last year, but Biden's support comes as many advocates stage protests and vigils in Sacramento calling on the California Democrat to sign the bill. \n\n\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro have both urged Newsom to sign the bill.\n\n\n\n“CA farmworkers provide for our families — but far too many can’t provide for theirs because they are exploited and don’t have a voice on the job,” Pelosi tweeted. “We can mend this injustice by expanding workers’ rights. I urge the governor to sign #AB2183 for the farmworkers and For The Children.”\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the governor told the Fresno Bee days prior to the bill’s passage that Newsom couldn’t support the legislation in its current form, but was open to negotiation.\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Newsom’s office for comment.\n\n\n\nBiden has pledged to be the most pro-union president in history, hosting union leaders organizing at major companies and speaking at the AFL-CIO’s convention in June. He reiterated his support for organized labor in his statement on Sunday, characterizing it as “democracy in action.”\n\n\n\n“Government should work to remove – not erect – barriers to workers organizing,” Biden said. “But ultimately workers must make the choice whether to organize a union.”\n\n\n\nCurrently, farm workers’ union elections are held via secret ballot at a polling place designated by a state labor board, typically the place of employment. The bill would expand voting options to include voting by mail or dropping off a ballot card directly to the labor board office, according to a summary of the legislation.\n\n\n\nThe bill would also enable workers to receive assistance in filling out and returning their ballot card.\n\n\n\nUnited Farm Workers, a prominent agricultural labor union, sponsored the bill’s passage and last month organized supporters for a 335-mile march to Sacramento, the state’s capital, to raise awareness.\n\n\n\n\"Today, President Biden communicated to the country his support for #AB2183 – the Agricultural Labor Relations Voting Choice Act,” tweeted United Farm Workers president Teresa Romero. “Farmworkers are grateful. ¡Sí se puede!”\n\n\n\nThe union has been holding 24-hour vigils as pressure grows for Newsom to sign the legislation. Newsom has requested the bill require an advance notice to employers about the specific union election date, the Sacramento Bee reported.\n\n\n\nNewsom vetoed a similar bill last year, saying it contained “various inconsistencies and procedural issues.”\n\n\n\n“Significant changes to California's well-defined agricultural labor laws must be carefully crafted to ensure that both agricultural workers' intent to be represented and the right to collectively bargain is protected, and the state can faithfully enforce those fundamental rights,” he wrote to lawmakers at the time.",

        "description": "One hundred and forty years ago, on September 5, 1882, workers in New York City celebrated the first Labor Day holiday with a parade. The parade almost didn&#8217;t happen: there was no band, and no one wanted to start marching without music. Once the Jewelers Union of Newark Two showed up with musicians, the rest of the marchers, eventually numbering between 10,000 and 20,000 men and women, fell in behind them to parade through lower Manhattan. At noon, when they reached the end of the route, the march broke up and the participants listened to speeches, drank beer, and had picnics. Other workers joined them.Their goal was to emphasize the importance of workers in the industrializing economy and to warn politicians that they could not be ignored. Less than 20 years before, northern men had fought a war to defend a society based on free labor and had, they thought, put in place a government that would support the ability of all hardworking men to rise to prosperity. By 1882, though, factories and the fortunes they created had swung the government toward men of capital, and workingmen worried they would lose their rights if they didn&#8217;t work together. A decade before, the Republican Party, which had formed to protect free labor, had thrown its weight behind Wall Street. By the 1880s, even the staunchly Republican Chicago Tribune complained about the links between business and government: &#8220;Behind every one of half of the portly and well-dressed members of the Senate can be seen the outlines of some corporation interested in getting or preventing legislation,&#8221; it wrote. The Senate, Harper&#8217;s Weekly noted, was &#8220;a club of rich men.&#8221; The workers marching in New York City carried banners saying: &#8220;Labor Built This Republic and Labor Shall Rule it,&#8221; &#8220;Labor Creates All Wealth,&#8221; &#8220;No Land Monopoly,&#8221; &#8220;No Money Monopoly,&#8221; &#8220;Labor Pays All Taxes,&#8221; &#8220;The Laborer Must Receive and Enjoy the Full Fruit of His Labor,&#8221; &#8216;Eight Hours for a Legal Day&#8217;s Work,&#8221; and &#8220;The True Remedy is Organization and the Ballot.&#8221; The New York Times denied that workers were any special class in the United States, saying that &#8220;[e]very one who works with his brain, who applies accumulated capital to industry, who directs or facilitates the operations of industry and the exchange of its products, is just as truly a laboring man as he who toils with his hands&#8230;and each contributes to the creation of wealth and the payment of taxes and is entitled to a share in the fruits of labor in proportion to the value of his service in the production of net results.&#8221;In other words, the growing inequality in the country was a function of the greater value of bosses than their workers, and the government could not possibly adjust that equation. The New York Daily Tribune scolded the workers for holding a political&#8212;even a &#8220;demagogical&#8221;&#8212;event. &#8220;It is one thing to organize a large force of&#8230;workingmen&#8230;when they are led to believe that the demonstration is purely non-partisan; but quite another thing to lead them into a political organization&#8230;.&#8221; Two years later, workers helped to elect Democrat Grover Cleveland to the White House. A number of Republicans crossed over to support the reformer Cleveland, afraid that, as he said, &#8220;The gulf between employers and the employed is constantly widening, and classes are rapidly forming, one comprising the very rich and powerful, while in another are found the toiling poor&#8230;. Corporations, which should be the carefully restrained creatures of the law and the servants of the people, are fast becoming the people&#8217;s masters.&#8221; In 1888, Cleveland again won the popular vote-- by about 100,000 votes-- but his Republican opponent, Benjamin Harrison, won in the Electoral College. Harrison promised that his would be &#8220;A BUSINESS MAN&#8217;S ADMINISTRATION&#8221; and said that &#8220;before the close of the present Administration business men will be thoroughly well content with it&#8230;.&#8221; Businessmen mostly were, but the rest of the country wasn&#8217;t. In November 1892 a Democratic landslide put Cleveland back in office, along with the first Democratic Congress since before the Civil War. As soon as the results of the election became apparent, the Republicans declared that the economy would collapse. Harrison&#8217;s administration had been &#8220;beyond question the best business administration the country has ever seen,&#8221; one businessmen&#8217;s club insisted, so losing it could only be a calamity. &#8220;The Republicans will be passive spectators,&#8221; the Chicago Tribune noted. &#8220;It will not be their funeral.&#8221; People would be thrown out of work, but &#8220;[p]erhaps the working classes of the country need such a lesson&#8230;.&#8221;As investors rushed to take their money out of the U.S. stock market, the economy collapsed a few days before Cleveland took office in early March 1893. Trying to stabilize the economy by enacting the proposals capitalists wanted, Cleveland and the Democratic Congress had to abandon many of the pro-worker policies they had promised, and the Supreme Court struck down the rest (including the income tax).They could, though, support Labor Day and its indication of workers&#8217; political power. On June 28, 1894, Cleveland signed Congress&#8217;s bill making Labor Day a legal holiday. In Chicago the chair of the House Labor Committee, Lawrence McGann (D-IL), told the crowd gathered for the first official observance: &#8220;Let us each Labor day, hold a congress and formulate propositions for the amelioration of the people. Send them to your Representatives with your earnest, intelligent indorsement [sic], and the laws will be changed.&#8221;&#8212;Notes:https://www.dol.gov/general/laborday/history-dazeNew York Times, September 6, 1882, p. 8.New York Times, September 6, 1882, p. 4.New York Daily Tribune, September 7, 1882, p. 4.https://blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2011/09/S-730.pdfhttps://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1851-1900/The-first-Labor-Day/Share",

He had saved three set points with some audacious touches, but as he generated three of his own, each time he was ground down by the immense durability of Daniil Medvedev.There was a time not long ago when this could have all gone awry, with the tiebreak level at 11-11. But not these days. Under immense pressure, Kyrgios gave the purest demonstration of his ball striking talent, following up an explosive down-the-line backhand with a delicate drop shot winner, an audacious combination of shots that set the tone for what was to come.

        "description": "Australian beats Ludmilla Samsonova of Russia 7-6, 6-1 Joins compatriot Nick Kyrgios in last eight at Flushing MeadowsAmid a despairing moment for Australian tennis three years ago, there was a realisation among the nation’s officials that they had been blessed with another talent possessing significant grit. Ajla Tomljanović, who continued her stirring US Open run on Sunday night in New York, emerged as a silver lining from a devastating Fed Cup final loss to France in Perth in 2019.The 29-year-old, who saved eight set points in the first set when defeating Ludmila Samsanova 7-6, 6-1 on Sunday, was badly beaten on the opening day of the final. Captain Alicia Molik had options in reserve for the reverse singles. But she sensed a rare steeliness in a woman who had overcome a terrible shoulder injury just to return to tennis.

Officers arrived at the 900 block of Case Avenue East around 4:30 p.m., after getting a report that multiple people had been shot. They found two people with gunshot wounds outside a residence. Officers were then told that there were more people inside who had been shot. The three shooting victims inside were pronounced dead on scene. The two victims outside were taken to a hospital for treatment. Police are still searching for the person or people responsible for the shooting, and didn’t release any information about the identity of the victims or the exact circumstances of the shooting.“We know that people want answers to what occurred out here,” said Sgt. Mike Ernster, a spokesperson for the St. Paul Police Department. “This is one of the most complex crime scenes we have investigated in a long time … We want to get it right.”The three deaths bring the total number of homicides investigated by St. Paul police this year to 27.",

        "description": "The Dodgers have signed right-hander Keone Kela to a minor league deal, according to his transactions tracker at MLB.com. The deal is listed as taking place on August 31, which is significant as 11:59pm ET on August 31 was the postseason eligibility cutoff. Those within an organization but not on the 40-man at the start of September can still be added to the postseason roster to replace a player on the injured list via petition to the commissioner’s office.\nKela, 29, has spent time with the Rangers, Pirates and Padres in his MLB career. Since debuting in 2015, he&#8217;s thrown 227 1/3 innings with a 3.33 ERA, 29.9% strikeout rate, 9.2% walk rate and 43.8% ground ball rate. He&#8217;s often been trusted with high leverage situations as well, having racked up 28 saves and 59 holds in his career.\nUnfortunately, health issues have slowed him down in recent years. In 2020, a positive COVID test and forearm tightness limited him to just two innings on the season. Last year, he logged 10 2/3 frames before requiring Tommy John surgery in May. He signed a minor league deal with the Diamondbacks for this season and returned to the mound in July. He threw 12 innings between Arizona&#8217;s Complex League team and the Triple-A  Reno Aces. He was released and latched on with the Dodgers last week.\nIt&#8217;s been a few years since Kela has been able to be effective over an extended stretch, but he threw 29 2/3 innings for the Pirates in 2019 with a 2.12 ERA. If his return to game action after his lengthy layoff goes well, he could be an option for a Dodgers team that has the best record in baseball and is cruising into the postseason. That&#8217;s despite a bevy of injuries to the pitching staff, as the club currently has 10 hurlers on the IL.
