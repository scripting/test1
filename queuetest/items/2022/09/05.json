        "description": "Caleb Ferguson | Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Dodgers use 8 pitchers not named Alberto in win The Dodgers are now four-for-four in series against the Padres in 2022.  The Dodgers defeated the Padres 9-4 in a four-hour eight minute nine inning game at Dodger Stadium on Sunday.\nThe Dodgers offense only scored in two innings today but they made it count scoring five runs in the fourth inning and then four runs in the seventh inning.  \nIt was 100 degrees and cloudy at Dodger Stadium to add to the length of this game.\nThe two most impressive Dodger pitchers were the opener Caleb Ferguson and the winning pitcher Alex Vesia.\nAll Ferguson did today was strike out the only three batters he faced today.  And he got them all looking.  Vesia came in with two on and no outs in the fourth inning.  He then struck out Matt Beaty and Trent Grisham.  Vesia would retire Austin Nola on a pop out to end the inning.\nIn between Ferguson and Vesia, Ryan Pepiot pitched two-plus innings.  And pitch he did, he made 74 pitches and got six outs.  He also gave up three hits and four walks.\nThe Padres scored first in the third inning when with two outs and runners on first and second, Manny Machado’s was awarded an infield single after Trea Turner made a bad throw that allowed Austin Nola to score from second.\nThe Dodgers took the lead in the bottom of the fourth.  Will Smith tied the game when he hit a solo shot.  Smith had also homered in Clevinger’s prior start against the Dodgers this year.\n\n\nIs it hot outside or is it just Will? pic.twitter.com/5eLOCE0biN— Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) September 5, 2022\n\n\n\nLater, a walk, single and hit-by-pitch loaded the bases for Cody Bellinger.  Clevinger would walk Bellinger to score the second run of the inning.  Luis Garcia would replace Clevinger and Mookie Betts hit a sacrifice fly to make it 3-1 Dodgers.\nTrea Turner followed with a parachute ball that fell in between Jurickson Profar and Ha-Seong Kim.  Turner ended up with a two-run double and a four-run lead over the Padres.\nThe Dodgers maintained that lead until the seventh inning.  Evan Phillips entered the game carrying a streak of 29 consecutive batters retired.  It looked that streak would continue when Jurickson Profar hit a foul pop up behind home plate. \nBut Will Smith didn’t catch the ball so Profar took his second chance and doubled home two runs.  Jake Cronenworth doubled home Profar to make it a one-run game.  That was the first run Phillips had given up since July 21st.  \nThe Dodgers responded in the bottom of the inning with leadoff walk to Smith.  Max Muncy singled off the base of the right-field wall to put runners at the corners.  Justin Turner lashed a double to left scoring Smith.\nTrayce Thompson pinch-hit for Joey Gallo after the Padres brought in a left-hander Adrian Morejon.  In 2022, Thompson has had a severe reverse split where he hit .167 against southpaws while smashing right-handed pitchers.\nThompson greeted Morejon with this blast to put the game again in the Dodgers hands for safekeeping.\n\n\nTRAYCE KNEW. pic.twitter.com/bGFZhewifl— Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) September 5, 2022\n\n\n\nCraig Kimbrel retired the final three batters in order and the Dodgers were able to end the week as it started with a win.\nMagic Number\nWith the win, the Dodgers magic number to win the NL West is 9.  \nSunday particulars\nHome runs: Will Smith (21), Trayce Thompson (8)\nWP — Alex Vesia (4-0): 1⅓ IP, 1 walk, 2 strikeouts\nLP —  Mike Clevinger (5-6): 3⅓ IP, 4 hits, 5 runs, 2 walks, 4 strikeouts\nUp next\nThe Dodgers will finish this homestand with a three-game series against the Giants.  The first game will have Andrew Heaney go against Logan Webb.  First pitch is at 7:10 p.m. and will be on SportsNet LA.",

        "description": "It’s that time of year again, as the Dodgers close in on their ninth National League West title in ten years. The division has been put to bed for some time, but will soon be official. Perhaps the more relevant goals to claim are a first-round bye, and home field advantage through the National League playoffs and potentially the World Series.\nNL West\nThe division was tied as late as June 22, believe it or not, but you wouldn’t know it based on the current standings, thanks to the Dodgers having two of their best months in franchise history, back-to-back.\nDodgers 92-42 (.687) - - -Padres 74-62 (.544) 19 GB\nThe Dodgers’ magic number to clinch the NL West is 8, meaning any combination of Dodgers wins and Padres losses that reach that number clinches the division for Los Angeles. The Dodgers already clinched the season series over the Padres. There are no more Game 163 regular season tiebreakers any more, so winning the season series would give the Dodgers the edge should the two teams somehow tie.\nThe earliest the Dodgers can clinch the division this year is Saturday, September 10. Their earliest clinch date in franchise history was September 8, 1955, in Game No. 138 of a 154-game season. Since moving to Los Angeles, the earliest clinch by date was September 10, 2019, in the team’s 146th game of a 162-game campaign.\nTuesday schedule6:40 p.m.: Padres vs. D-backs7:10 p.m.: Dodgers vs. Giants\nBypassing the wild card round\nThe division winners with the best two records in each league get the top two seeds, and an automatic berth in the Division Series. This year, with the last game of the regular season on October 5 and the start of the NLDS on October 11, that means five days off to plan the rotation order you want, plus facing a wild card team that played at least two games, and possibly three, before heading your way.\nLA’s target here is St. Louis, leaders of the NL Central, currently in the No. 3 spot. If the Dodgers clinch a better record than the Cardinals — or, if the Brewers should somehow pass them, then clinching a better record than Milwaukee — Los Angeles will bypass the wild card round entirely.\nDodgers 92-42 (.687) - - -Cardinals 79-56 (.585) 13½ GB\nThe Dodgers’ magic number to clinch a bye is 15. The Dodgers won two of three in St. Louis in July. These two teams play in Los Angeles from September 23-25.\nNo. 1 overall seed in the National League\nThe Mets are in a dogfight for the NL East with the Braves, with that division winner in line for the No. 2 seed. New York holds a one-game lead over Atlanta for the divsion\nDodgers 92-42 (.687) - - -Mets 85-50 (.630) 7½ GBBraves 84-51 (.622) 8½ GB\nThe Dodgers’ magic number to clinch home field advantage through the NLCS is 21. The Mets have the tiebreaker over the Dodgers by winning four of seven games this season. The Dodgers have the tiebreaker over Atlanta, by winning four of six games.",

The attributes are: learner control, verifiability, tamper-proofing, portability, and employability-driven. The suggestion is that, properly designed, blockchain can address these issues. They offer a four-layer model for developing such a system and recommend \"users involvement strategies to improve social understanding and acceptance of blockchain technology.\"\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

Maybe there are parts missing from the online publication (the PDFs are locked behind a paywall - maybe organizations that call for \"more transparency about the skills students acquire\" and complain \"this has not been a strength of most higher education systems\" should rethink their pay-to-view policy). There's more information in cartoon form and in OECD's skills for 2030 document. It's interesting that universities resisted the OECD study with the result that this report only \"reports on the work pursued between 2016 and 2021 to assess critical thinking and written communication, and associated skills in higher education institutions in six countries.\"\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

        "description": "She was a model-turned-photographer whose unflinching eye captured the horror of the Nazis. But for too long, this extraordinary woman was defined as ‘Picasso’s muse’. As a new show puts this right, her son looks backThere’s a picture of the US photographer and war correspondent Lee Miller with Pablo Picasso, taken by her after the liberation of Paris in 1944. They are gazing into one another’s eyes with such intimacy that you feel you’re intruding on something deeply personal. Not romantic, exactly – although the way his hand grazes the back of her neck is certainly intimate – but profoundly loving, perhaps. With this in mind, it’s unsurprising that the image has been chosen to promote a new exhibition centred on Miller’s extraordinary life and the relationship between these two artists, which opens this week at Newlands House Gallery in Petworth, West Sussex.It captured, her son Antony Penrose tells me, an extraordinary moment after years of hardship and separation. “Lee found her way to Picasso’s studio in Rue des Grands-Augustins, hammered on the door. He opened it and nearly fell over backwards. And he hugged her and he kissed her and he hugged her, and then finally, when he stood back, he looked at her and he said, ‘It’s incredible. The first allied soldier I should see is a woman. She is you.’” Continue reading...",

Nick Ciuffo had the first:\n\n\nNICK AT KNIGHT! @nciuffo14 goes YARD! pic.twitter.com/8w1WxOjanJ— Charlotte Knights (@KnightsBaseball) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nand Craig Dedelow, the newer of the two hitters, hit the second.\n\n\nIT IS HIGH... IT IS GONE! @Craig_DEEDS with a solo homer to tie the game! pic.twitter.com/g5cS8Z6dJc— Charlotte Knights (@KnightsBaseball) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThe final two runs came in the seventh to tie the game, and a Zach Remillard RBI single scored both runs. John Parke started the game and allowed those first four runs in his 5 2⁄3 innings. \nParker Markel came in after all of the scoring in the eighth, and immediately gave up three runs and the win. Charlotte did attempt to mount a comeback in the ninth and had the tying run at the plate. But clearly, they did not come fully back.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nThe Barons came out on top in a 25-run game, which was good for the offense but a bad showing for the arms. Norge Vera got the start and was really off. He walked four batters and threw more balls (32) than strikes (23), allowing three runs in his 2 2⁄3 innings. Kohl Simas relieved him and was pulled after just one out. He also struggled with command, with a 50-50 split between balls and strikes. It did not get much better after that, as Kaleb Roper came in for the next three innings and was burned by a four-run fifth. Thankfully, the Barons offense took over from there, with 10 runs from innings seven through 10.\nThe offense left the day with 15 runs over 16 hits, with a lot of timely hitting. As a team, Birmingham went 8-for-17 with runners in scoring position, so they took real advantage of all the batters on base. Three of those hits were homers and they were all multi-run efforts. Luis Mieses had the first:\n\n\nLuis Mieses tees off on #2 for the #Barons.

Muno and Castillo come in to make the score 15-10.  #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/LwYrg4ibJN— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 5, 2022\n\n\n\nColás, Mieses, and Yoelqui Céspedes each had three hits to lead the team. Veras’ homer was the only hit for him tonight, though he did have one of the two walks from the team.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nPretty much a bad game for the Dash from the start. The offense was never going to participate much in the game, and the pitching was awful right away. Brooks Gosswein started and only recorded one out before getting pulled. He allowed three runs because of some poor command; he threw as many strikes as balls. Cooper Bradford took over and put up two more runs in the second, both off of solo homers. The rest of the game went well for the arms, they were already out of the game though. Jordan Mikel had the best stint of the bunch, two scoreless innings but no strikeouts. \nThe only hit from Winston-Salem today came from Caberea Weaver, a single. To put in perspective how impotent the W-S offense was, Weaver is now up to a .160 average on the year. Only one other batter reached base and it was a James Beard walk, so it was a truly horrendous day for the bats. \n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nIt was a good day for Kannapolis, and a great day for the draft class. On the mound, they 2022 class had three scoreless innings, against six innings from older players who allowed five runs. Jonathan Cannon started and had the first two shutout innings, Billy Seidl closed out the game with that third scoreless stint. They both have yet to allow a Low-A run in their very short professional careers.\nFrom the lineup, yes, holdover Logan Glass did have the best day with three hits, two of them homers. Here is one of them:\n\n\nLogan Glass pummels another HR (#7) scoring Troy Claunch. 3-0 #Ballers. #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/FuiTZRibKk— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nMost of the hits came from the 2022 class with Troy Claunch, Tim Elko and Jacob Burke each getting two. Burke’s hits were two doubles, to basically double his Low-A total to five.",

        "description": "People suggest that I am somehow a race traitor because I love Shakespeare and listen to Taylor Swift. But I am enormously proud of my blacknessI like listening to Taylor Swift; I love period dramas; I am enormously proud of my blackness – and I have been called a “coconut” more times than I can count. To be called a “coconut” – a person who is “black on the outside and white on the inside” – is to be told that having defiantly forced your way into a space previously inaccessible to you as a result of racism, unconscious or otherwise, you are no longer permitted to return to your community. You are now a traitor. It operates under an assumption that “blackness” is a small singular box of identity, not a vast sprawling landscape of experiences and intersections. That is not to say that being a “race traitor” is an entirely redundant concept. There are lots of ways people of colour can do harm to their own communities – by working for political groups with a proven track record of race- and class-based discrimination, for example.My grandmother grew up with no money in 1930s Jamaica and was one of only two people in her year to pass the exams necessary to train as a nurse. She was bookish and studious and, for her, literature and education were her liberators. She moved to London as part of the Windrush generation in 1952, and bought a house in Clapham in 1973, where she raised and educated a family. I have always been very proud of this. As a child, sitting at the feet of my grandmother, the books thrust into my hands were treated simultaneously as treasures and weapons, and the scholarship I got to an all-girls private school was an achievement, a prized opportunity. It was only when I became this person, a proud product of the environment so many had worked hard to create, that I felt the sting of that word. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Once a beacon of possibility for Māori workers, the Essity paper mill at Kawerau is becoming a symbol of what has been lostIn 1948, when my Koro (grandfather) was born, the town of Kawerau was little more than a strip of old homesteads on the road between Rotorua and Whakatane. It had a Presbyterian church and a marae, but the nearest school and store were in the next town over – a 10-minute drive through rolling farmland and drained wetlands. Yet only six years later, when Koro was enrolled at the “native school” in 1954, Kawerau had become a city of concrete and steel. High-rise factories were built, chimneys and pipes were constructed and drills were imported to open hidden seams of geothermal steam as the Tasman Pulp and Paper Mill took shape. At its height, the mill had more than 2,000 men working on site and was responsible for 20% of the country’s exports.In its day Tasman was the ideal model for what state capitalism could achieve. Within Koro’s first five years the government had established a joint stock company, laid a rail line from Kawerau to the port of Tauranga, extended the port’s wharf, constructed the newsprint machines to guarantee the mill’s success, and recruited hundreds of American managerial staff, British engineers, Finnish paper workers and Pacific Island labourers to man the new mill. Tasman became the largest pulp and paper mill in the southern hemisphere. Kawerau went from a kāinga (settlement) of no more than a couple hundred people to a town of thousands of people from around the world. Continue reading...",

Then came the diagnosis that threw it all into questionThe morning that Devanshi Mavani reached the top of Kilimanjaro, the conditions were bitter. She had set off, like most hikers, the night before to time her arrival at the summit with the sunrise. Immediately, heavy snow began to fall. “Normally people see Kenya on the other side. When we got to the summit, we saw nothing,” she says. “It was like a ski slope. But I was crying with happiness.”Just 17 months earlier, this trip had seemed impossible. In May 2017, Mavani returned home to Leicester after visiting her younger sister in Oxford and began to feel unwell. Each day was worse than the one before. “But you don’t get flu,” her sister said, and told Mavani to go to a local chemist for tests. The pharmacy sent Mavani straight to her GP, and the GP called an ambulance. Continue reading...",

        "description": "If you can catch your breath, the Maratona in Italy’s Dolomites is the world’s most beautiful bike raceDon’t forget to look up,” says Miguel “Big Mig” Indurain, the great Spanish cycling campeón, to the massed ranks of nervously fidgeting riders. We all laugh because how could anyone forget to notice the stunning sweep of the Dolomites unfurling above the forested valley behind him. But we know he’s right. Because for the next eight hours or so, most of us will be lost in a world of self-inflicted torment as we pedal agonisingly up vertiginous hills, only to plummet with our hearts in our mouths down the other side, before doing it again, and again… We are in Italy’s picturesque South Tyrol to take part in the glorious Maratona dles Dolomites – Enel. It’s one of the hardest – and almost certainly the most scenic – one-day bike races in the world.Mountains and bicycles aren’t natural bedfellows. Defying the thigh-burning power of gravity tends to spoil what could be a blissful union. But the annual Maratona manages to celebrate the jaw-dropping beauty of this brutal landscape by sending 8,000 Lycra-clad riders up and down seven of its most famous peaks. And, despite the fact that almost every single one of us will spend the day cursing the absurdity of cycling uphill, none of us would have it any other way. The spellbinding physical beauty of the Dolomites will take your breath away in more ways than you could imagine. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Inspired by African culture and fictional worlds like Marvel’s Wakanda, Sauúti is an imagined civilisation designed by and for African speculative writersCreative writing can be a lonely business. As writers, we inhabit whole worlds and characters that live only in our heads for days or years, as we deposit them on the page. This is particularly true for speculative fiction – an umbrella genre of stories that involve supernatural or futuristic elements, or settings that are not the real world.This creative loneliness is why I’ve always admired the concept of a “shared world” – a fictional setting with its own set of rules where multiple authors can create stories. Some examples are Thieves’ World, edited by Robert Lynn Asprin, or George RR Martin’s Wild Cards (which spawned dozens of books, comics and games, and was optioned for film and TV).

        "description": "The singer-songwriter fought with his father, fell out with children Rufus and Martha and drove away his first wife before the honeymoon was even over. At 76, has he finally made some kind of peace with the world?Whisper it: Loudon Wainwright III is happy. The great curmudgeon of popular music has spent 50-plus years picking at old scabs, showcasing his selfishness and documenting his tortured relationship with his famous family. But he has finally made a hopeful album. Sure, we still hear from the Wainwright of old; the tragicomic misanthrope who quotes Sartre’s “Hell is other people” in the song Family Vacation, about his need to take a holiday from his family. But Lifetime Achievement shimmers with grace, acceptance and, dare we say it, love.When I mention it, Wainwright sounds a little embarrassed. He ums and ahs, coughs and splutters his way to an admission of sorts. “Yes,” he says apologetically, “there are a number of songs that would make you wonder what’s happened here. It’s not the usual cynical nihilist that we’ve grown to love over the years. There is an optimism. The last few years have been good to me.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "The Savage Garden singer on his violent father, embracing his sexuality and performing with PavarottiSinger-songwriter Darren Hayes was born in Brisbane in 1972. His journey to stardom began in 1993, when Hayes responded to an advertisement in a newspaper written by Daniel Jones, a local musician searching for a vocalist to front his covers band, Red Edge. Hayes and Jones would go on to form the duo Savage Garden, releasing only two albums but selling more than 25m records globally and creating some of the definitive ballads of the 90s: Truly Madly Deeply, To the Moon and Back and I Knew I Loved You. Hayes went on to forge a successful solo career, and his new album, Homosexual, is out on 7 October. He tours his greatest hits in March 2023.This photo isn’t what it appears to be. It looks like a sweet setup of a 12-year-old boy smiling in his bedroom with the world on his lap and a poster of his favourite artist behind him. What you can’t see are the other rooms in that house, with holes in the walls patched up with putty. Or how unhappy I was, with a violent alcoholic father who would physically abuse my mother.

        "description": "Inspired by African culture and fictional worlds like Marvel’s Wakanda, Sauúti is an imagined civilisation designed by and for African speculative writersCreative writing can be a lonely business. As writers, we inhabit whole worlds and characters that live only in our heads for days or years, as we deposit them on the page. This is particularly true for speculative fiction – an umbrella genre of stories that involve supernatural or futuristic elements, or settings that are not the real world.This creative loneliness is why I’ve always admired the concept of a “shared world” – a fictional setting with its own set of rules where multiple authors can create stories. Some examples are Thieves’ World, edited by Robert Lynn Asprin, or George RR Martin’s Wild Cards (which spawned dozens of books, comics and games, and was optioned for film and TV).

Click on the link or the lady in the upper righthand corner.\nLabor Day Thoughts\nMaynard G. Krebs is a cultural icon. For those who haven&#8217;t had the pleasure, Maynard was the beatnik best friend of the title character on the sitcom called The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, which ran from 1959 through 1963, but found a wider audience on cable TV later on. Played by the late, great Bob Denver before he left for Gilligan&#8217;s Island, Maynard&#8217;s claim to fame was his reaction to the word &#8220;work.&#8221;\n&#8220;Work?!&#8221; he would yelp in response everytime it was mentioned, as if it were the most horrifying pursuit he could imagine.\nWas Maynard prescient? Did he foresee the so-called &#8220;Great Resignation&#8221; of 2021, when 49.4 million American workers quit their jobs, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics? Could he have imagined the trend that followed in the second half of 2022, an alternative to complete severance, known as &#8220;Quiet Quitting&#8221;?\n&#8220;Quiet quitting is the trend of employees choosing to not go above and beyond in their jobs in ways that include refusing to answer emails during evenings or weekends, or skipping extra assignments that fall outside their core duties,&#8221; cnbc explained. It was popularized as many things seem to be today: on TikTok, as seen below.\n\n@zaidleppelin On quiet quitting #workreform ♬ original sound &#8211; ruby\n\n\n\n\n&#8220;Love and work&#8230;work and love, that&#8217;s all there is,&#8221; said Sigmund Freud, the 20th-century neurologist who founded psychoanalysis. In the 21st century, prompted mostly by the pandemic, Freud&#8217;s premise and the proportions allotted to life&#8217;s pursuits are being questioned &#8212; mostly by Millennials and Gen Zers, seeking a &#8220;better balance,&#8221; CNBC said, last month. Concurrently, &#8220;the rate of U.S. productivity is raising some concern.&#8221; Reuters reported. &#8220;Data on U.S. worker productivity posted its biggest ever annual drop in the second quarter [of 2022].&#8221;\n\n\nCould Quiet Quitting lead to Frustrated Firing?\nNot as likely in the current labor market. &#8220;Booming jobs creation has also meant fierce competition between employers for a limited labor supply,&#8221; The Washington Post wrote in September. &#8220;There continue to be roughly two open jobs for every job seeker, according to the July job openings report, and workers continued to quit their jobs at an elevated rate in July, in [the] phenomenon dubbed the &#8216;Great Resignation.'&#8221;\nAnthony Klotz, a professor at Texas A&amp;M University&#8217;s business school, coined the phrase &#8220;Great Resignation.&#8221; “I knew from talking to my students, workers, and business leaders that the pandemic had changed how many people felt about work,” he said, in a school publication.\n“Workers saw that quitting their jobs gave them a chance to take control of their personal and professional lives&#8230;.In broader terms, [the Great Resignation] describes how COVID-19 upended the centuries-old notion of what work is and how it should be done.&#8221;\nHappy Labor Day!",

        "description": "With little plot and almost no dialogue, Playtime does not seem an obvious fit for theatre. Will the addition of songs by Martha Wainwright and Chilly Gonzales help?Comedy doesn’t get any more cinematic than Playtime, Jacques Tati’s 1967 masterpiece. Shot on 70mm (the widescreen format associated with such epics as Lawrence of Arabia) and filmed just outside Paris on a specially constructed city-like set nicknamed Tativille, the picture follows assorted tourists and commuters in their mishap-laden encounters with a sterile, mechanised modern world. Near-plotless and with minimal dialogue, Playtime took three years to make and helped to bankrupt its creator, who wanders through the action as his signature character, the bumbling Monsieur Hulot. Yet it remains the ultimate proof, as the late Terry Jones put it, that comedy “could be both funny and beautiful”.With its highly detailed steel-and-glass cityscape and carousel-like traffic jams, the film is not the most obvious candidate for a stage adaptation with a cast of five. If anyone can pull it off, though, it will be Dancing Brick, AKA the husband-and-wife team of Valentina Ceschi and Thomas Eccleshare, who trained at the Jacques Lecoq clown school in Paris. “Slapstick is such a wonderful leveller,” Ceschi tells me during rehearsals at a community centre in Northampton. “It shows that we’re all human and vulnerable.” Continue reading...",

Looking back, I can say that Mitcham, and England more generally, had a huge influence on me as a writer and a poet. I absorbed the fact that the country was a monarchy, which is probably one of the reasons why, when I started making records, I often referred to myself as Rick the Ruler or Richard of Nottingham. Britannia also had a huge impact on me, style-wise. The Kangol hats. The king’s crown and regal cape. Continue reading...",

        "description": "This Bond versus the Beatles study works best as a series of lively historical nuggets rather than a fight for the nation’s cultural soulIt is a curious fact that the Beatles’ debut single, Love Me Do, and the first James Bond film, Dr No, were both released on Friday 5 October 1962. No one could have predicted that we would still be thrilled by the band’s music six decades later, or that the film franchise would still be going strong. John Higgs, however, had the intriguing idea of exploring their creation, development and afterlives in parallel.Though he inevitably covers some well-trodden territory, much of the detail is poignant and entertaining. In the early days of Beatlemania, Ringo Starr’s house was surrounded by fans 24 hours a day. His mother, Elsie, politely offered them sandwiches – which they took away, uneaten, as souvenirs. A friend admitted it was “awkward, particularly as the toilet was still in the yard”. The rulers of the Soviet Union, anxious about the rise of western youth culture, made strenuous efforts to discredit the Beatles. One article depicted them as monkeys and called them “Dung Beatles”, while a propaganda film, reports Higgs, bizarrely “intercut unflattering photographs of [the band] together with images of the Ku Klux Klan, ecstatic pop fans dancing, burning crosses and images of rural poverty from the American south”.

Here the orchestra saved some of the spotlight for the composer George Walker, even as it made exhilarating work of the annual Proms performance of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony.Walker’s music went unheard at the Proms until Chineke!’s debut here in 2017, but it, too, is gaining traction. Earlier this year London audiences heard Lilacs, the song cycle that in 1996 made Walker the first Black winner of the Pulitzer prize for music, courtesy of the LSO and the soprano Nicole Cabell; she was again the soloist here at the Royal Albert Hall. Lilacs sets words by Walt Whitman following the murder of Abraham Lincoln, and Walker’s music underpins a heady romanticism with a sense of underlying menace. The vocal line glides on languid, gauzy strings, the high notes glinting with touches of bell-like percussion and celesta. Cabell put it across with clear, unhurried eloquence and gleaming tone.

The city here is Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where in 2017 a modernist housing block known affectionately as the White Building was pulled down. Director Kavich Neang’s family was among the nearly 500 to be evicted, and this film predates Neang’s fictionalised account of the same events. In interviews, Neang has spoken about his embarrassment as a kid telling people that he lived in the White Building. It was home to artists, musicians and civil servants, but in later years became run down: it acquired a reputation for prostitution and drug-taking, and was downgraded to a slum.

        "description": "A new study finds milkweed plants from retailers across the country contain pesticides that could harm the monarch butterflies attracted to the plants.  Milkweed is a host plant for monarchs, and many people plant it in gardens to provide breeding habitat. Eggs laid on the plant hatch into caterpillars which become butterflies. “We looked in 15 different states, including in Minnesota, and we looked from very small retailers to large, big box stores,” said Aimée Code, pesticide program director at the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, and one of the study authors. “What we found is that these plants that are [purchased] to support pollinators might actually cause harm to them. So it&#x27;s a plant that is pollinator-attractive, but it might not be pollinator-safe,” she said.The researchers found multiple pesticides in every milkweed plant they tested, and in about a third of the plants they found pesticides at levels known to be harmful, but not lethal, to monarchs. A monarch butterfly rests on a plant at Abbott&#x27;s Mill Nature Center in Milford, Del., July 29, 2019. Carolyn Kaster | AP 2019They also found the ability to assess risk is limited. “Through our research, we realized how little data we know about the impacts these pesticides have on monarchs,” said Code. “There were only nine pesticides of the total 61 that we found that we had data on as to how toxic they were. So while we didn&#x27;t find any pesticides at lethal levels, we also don&#x27;t know what those lethal levels are for most of these chemicals.”  Pesticides in wildflowersPlantings intended to aid bees may be crippling themLawns to habitatBig buzz about pollinator-friendly programMonarch migrationHow do they know where to go, and when?Climate riskButterfly sanctuaries affected by changing climateMonarch populations are in decline and many people plant milkweed in backyards and other locations in an effort to help the butterfly. Code said the study does not mean every milkweed plant sold at a retailer is contaminated, but it does mean consumers must be aware of potential pesticide contamination.“We still need to put these plants in our garden, but we need to make sure that these plants are safer,” said Code. &quot;If you buy a plant to the store, and you don&#x27;t know if it was contaminated or not, that doesn&#x27;t mean you throw out the plant, especially a milkweed which can last for many years, but it means that you take steps to avoid pesticide exposure,&quot; she said.Code said protective steps might include removing the soil in the pot the plant was purchased in. It might mean placing a net over the plant for a year to keep butterflies from landing on it until the pesticides on the plant break down.",

        "description": "Nathan Ray Seebeck-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Benintendi to undergo surgery, 2022 fate unknown; Judge inching closer to Maris; benches clear in Yankees-Rays game; On Rizzo’s return MLB.com | Bryan Hoch: Yankees outfielder Andrew Benintendi broke the hook of the hamate bone in his right hand on Friday’s game against the Rays, according to manager Aaron Boone. The initial X-rays came back negative, but since he felt a pop on his wrist after a swing, the Yankees had him undergo additional testing to confirm the bad news. He will need surgery.\nBenintendi was one of the few Yankees who was producing, with a .298/.339/.474 line over his last 15 games, but he will be out of action for the foreseeable future. The outfielder said that he will speak with specialists in New York and believes that he may be able to make it back before the end of the season, although that’s far from a given.\n\n\nAndrew Benintendi said he will speak with specialists in NYC, but he thinks he may be able to return before the end of the regular season. He had a similar injury as a college freshman.— Bryan Hoch (@BryanHoch) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nNew York Post | Dan Martin: The Yankees have had all kinds of offensive issues in recent weeks. However, the one constant in the middle of the continued struggles has been Aaron Judge. The outfielder hit his 53rd home run of the year on Sunday against the Tampa Bay Rays, as the Yanks got a much-needed win to stop the bleeding.\nJudge hit a monstrous home run into the upper deck in left field at Tropicana Field. He is now just eight round-trippers from tying the franchise record for a single season, held by Roger Maris in 1961 with 61. Yesterday’s homer helped Judge establish a new personal high, surpassing the 52 he hit in 2017 when he was a rookie (though technically, he should’ve had 53 that year if not for a bad call in April).\nNJ Advance Media | Brendan Kuty: Josh Donaldson and the Rays clearly don’t like each other. The Yankees’ infielder was in the middle of a benches-clearing incident in the second frame, when Shawn Armstrong pitched him up and in and a verbal confrontation ensued.\nDonaldson yelled at Armstrong and had to be held back by catcher Christian Bethancourt. Benches cleared, but no punches were thrown. Evidently, the two teams don’t like each other, especially as the Rays are now much closer to the Yanks in the standings and are looking to take the AL East division crown away from them.\nMLB.com: Yankees first baseman Anthony Rizzo is reportedly doing better after having an epidural injection administered on Thursday by Dr. Robert Watkins in Los Angeles. He had been suffering from back pain and missed the series against the Rays in Tampa, though he is not on the IL. Rizzo’s recent MRI came back clean, and per Boone, he will perform baseball activities today and a return to the lineup on Tuesday is not out of the question.\n(Update: Just kidding. Rizzo got awful headaches from the epidural and will not be with the team until Wednesday. Great!)\nAlso of note: injured reliever Scott Effross is in a throwing program and is set to throw a bullpen session on September 9th. He pitched well in eight games after coming over from the Cubs at the trade deadline, but has been on the shelf for two weeks with a shoulder strain.",

The jet, an Austria-registered Cessna 551, left Jerez in southern Spain on Sunday afternoon, turning at Paris and Cologne before flying straight out to the Baltic Sea, where it spiralled into the water east of Gotland, flight tracking data showed.

(credit: Impossible Foods)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re an environmentally aware meat-eater, you probably carry at least a little guilt to the dinner table. The meat on our plates comes at a significant environmental cost through deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and air and water pollution—an uncomfortable reality, given the world’s urgent need to deal with climate change.\nThat’s a big reason there’s such a buzz today around a newcomer to supermarket shelves and burger-joint menus: products that look like real meat but are made entirely without animal ingredients. Unlike the bean- or grain-based veggie burgers of past decades, these “plant-based meats,” the best known of which are Impossible Burger and  Beyond Meat, are marketed heavily toward traditional meat-eaters. They claim to replicate the taste and texture of real ground meat at a fraction of the environmental cost.\nIf these newfangled meat alternatives can fill a large part of our demand for meat—and if they’re as green as they claim, which is not easy to verify independently—they might offer carnivores a way to reduce the environmental impact of their dining choices without giving up their favorite recipes.Read 31 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

Whether you're inhaling mystical doodads in Kirby and the Forgotten Land or cruising through Guanajuato in Forza Horizon 5, games offer a digital retreat that feeds our fundamental need to play.\nUnfortunately, the scope of climate change is such that we will need to rethink almost every element of global society—including the game industry.\nBen Abraham has been thinking about the need for that kind of change for a long time. Speaking with Ars, Abraham recalled how, as a teenager, the top floor of his parents' split-level Australian home would become a grueling sauna thanks to a combination of the summer sun outside and a gaming PC (with cathode ray tube monitor) hemorrhaging heat inside.Read 24 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

The showstopper was an 8-inch diameter line carrying liquid hydrogen into the rocket. It sprang a persistent leak at the inlet, known as a quick-disconnect, leading onboard the vehicle.\n\nValiantly, the launch team at Kennedy Space Center tried three different times to stanch the leak, all to no avail. Finally at 11:17 am ET, hours behind on their timeline to fuel the rocket, launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson called a halt.Read 20 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Ars Technica)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor Day weekend isn't known as an especially fruitful time for deals on electronics, and generally speaking, that's the case again this year. As usual, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and other holiday sales toward the end of the year will bring bigger savings to those who can afford to wait.\nThat said, there are still a handful of notable discounts currently going on for gadgets and gear we like, so for our latest Dealmaster roundup, we've compiled the best Labor Day tech deals we can find below.\nThe highlights include the lowest prices we've tracked for Apple's 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, the entry-level versions of which are each $400 off, at $1,599 and $2,099, respectively. That's still a good chunk of change, clearly, and it's worth noting that refreshed versions of these notebooks could be announced as soon as next month. The recently overhauled MacBook Air is a better value for most people in need of a new Mac, too. But for developers, visual creatives, or power users who need the extra ports, multi-core performance, and GPU power the Pros can provide, there's still value to be had with these deals today.Read 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

PornHub still operates popular accounts on other social media platforms like Twitter. \nIt’s not clear exactly why Instagram’s parent company Meta removed the account, though screenshots shared by anti-PornHub campaigner Laila Mickelwait suggest the account was taken down for violating Instagram’s community guidelines.

The Yankees avoided the worst-case scenario last night, something they’ve been consistently doing for the last month or so. Instead of allowing the Rays to sweep them out of the Trop and blow open the division race, they salvaged a game to hold the line at five games. Instead of careening off of a cliff, they’re simply puttering alongside the edge with the gas tank nearing E.\nAaron Judge was half of the offense again, making his historic home run race also an intricately crucial part of the team’s ability to win games. We’ll check out where he stands compared to some of the other great single-season campaigns, and Jake will recap what went down around the league. Peter has a preview of what to expect pitching-wise for the Yankees’ next opponent in the Twins, and I’ll be around after the game to open up the mailbag for more questions.\nToday’s Matchup\nNew York Yankees vs. Minnesota Twins\nTime: 1:05 p.m. ET\nAD\nTV: YES Network, Bally Sports North, MLB Network (out-of-market only)\nRadio: 1280 WADO, 660/101.9 FM WFAN\nVenue: Yankee Stadium\nFun Questions/Prompts:\n  1.

        "description": "There was only one surprise in the vote tally for a United Nations General Assembly resolution in March condemning Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. As a wholly owned Vladimir Putin subsidiary, Belarus naturally followed instructions from headquarters; Syria’s “no” vote was repayment to the capo dei capi in Moscow for his regime-saving military support; and of course North Korea voted no. But Eritrea? Why would a little country in the Horn of Africa with no significant ties or obligations to Russia choose, at such a highly charged geopolitical moment, to give the finger to established norms of international behavior, in the process incurring irreversible reputational damage while seemingly gaining nothing?The case of Eritrea is worth considering because, like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it reminds us of a lesson the West should not forget as it navigates“post-truth” geopolitics: that totalitarian systems are inherently toxic and by their very nature destabilizing, and that no amount of “engagement” will change them.                             I, like all first-time visitors to Eritrea’s capital, was charmed by Asmara when I arrived as the new chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in 2019. The streets are immaculate; thanks to its Art Deco architecture, a living legacy of the Italian colonial period, the city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site; the weather is perfect.But in truth Eritrea is a human-rights house of horrors. Dissent is illegal. There is no independent press. Under compulsory, indefinite national service, citizens are conscripted or assigned to civilian jobs. The country has never held a national election. Eritreans live in a state of perpetual fear: Secret police and informers proliferate; arrests are arbitrary; citizens are routinely detained but not told on what charge, and the lucky ones who are released are given no reason for their freedom and are told to keep silent. Thanks to “revolutionary” economic policies, Eritrea is poor, has no infrastructure to speak of and thus no realistic hope for economic development, and is chronically food insecure. Before the coronavirus pandemic and the conflict in northern Ethiopia made cross-border travel impossible, hundreds of Eritreans fled their country every day.[From the May 1988 issue: The loneliest war]The regime’s desire for total control—“social mobilization” justified by an eternal state of emergency—pervades all sectors of Eritrean society. Citizens wishing to go abroad must get an exit visa; those traveling within the country must have “circulation papers” and produce them for armed soldiers at checkpoints along the way. There are four recognized religions; all other worship is illegal. Eritreans are allowed to withdraw only the equivalent of $330 a month from their bank accounts, and they must do this in person at bank branches because there are no ATMs in Eritrea and online banking does not exist. I wanted to visit a privately owned dairy last spring but was told that this would require a written invitation from the dairy, which then had to be sent to the Ministry of Agriculture for approval, then sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which would decide whether to issue a travel permit. Evil may be banal, but in Eritrea, it is also ridiculous.Eritrea didn’t exist when Jeane Kirkpatrick, a former diplomat and political scientist, wrote her classic “Dictatorships and Double Standards,” but the pariah state that today haunts the Horn of Africa confirms her essay’s contention that totalitarian systems are more pernicious than authoritarian ones, ideologically constructed in a way that precludes liberalization, and inevitably destabilizing. I read Kirkpatrick’s essay in graduate school. I forgot its important lessons.Instead, I recall with not a little embarrassment that I arrived in Asmara eager to “constructively engage” and optimistic that, through hard work and patience, I could improve ties between the U.S. and Eritrea. I was not alone in this newbie enthusiasm: Many a diplomat accredited to Eritrea has arrived brimming with energy and ambition only to depart a few years later frustrated, exhausted, and with little to show in terms of tangible achievements. My time in Eritrea was eventful, encompassing the coronavirus pandemic, the civil-war-like conflict in northern Ethiopia, and a drastic deterioration in our bilateral relationship. The experience was an education in the unique challenges that totalitarian systems pose. As a foreign-policy practitioner, I arrived at a number of conclusions about dealing with totalitarian states that are, in essence, a set of practical diplomatic corollaries to Kirkpatrick’s conceptual framework. (These represent my own views, not necessarily those of the Department of State.)1: Diplomatic engagement with totalitarian states is futile. The Eritrean regime loves to “engage”—to participate in and publicize talks and meetings that give the impression of openness and reasonability. During these interactions, however, Eritrean officials make clear to their foreign interlocutors that the regime will, as they told one of my colleagues, “compromise on process but not on principles.” In other words, you can “engage” indefinitely, but nothing is going to stop the regime from terrorizing and impoverishing its people, or destabilizing the region. (It has for decades intervened in, or triggered, conflicts and civil wars in neighboring states.) There is a natural tendency among diplomats, in Washington and elsewhere, to favor engagement. This is understandable, but potentially dangerous because engagement, if not carefully calibrated, risks legitimizing totalitarian regimes. The U.S., like-minded countries, and the UN should continue to deal with Eritrea, and even cooperate on issues of mutual interest, but this should be tactical interaction subordinate to a strategic appreciation that the regime is inimical, if not hostile, to our interests and values.[William J. Burns: A make-or-break test for American diplomacy]2. We should support oppressed populations by acknowledging their lived reality. Totalitarian regimes aren’t satisfied with political control. They demand the pervasive control that can only come by determining the “truth.” According to the carefully curated narrative propagated by the Ministry of Information, Eritrea is an African David engaged in a righteous fight for its dignity and survival against a U.S.-led Western Goliath that “weaponizes” human rights. In this telling, the government and people, united as one, have achieved social justice, national self-reliance, and ethnic and religious harmony. In fact, Eritrea is a human-rights-abusing geriatric dictatorship dominated by Tigrigna Orthodox Christians that is totally dependent on borrowing from foreigners. The U.S. may not be able to rescue the Eritrean people, or any other people living under totalitarian dictatorships, but by providing accurate information and diverse views, it can empower them by thwarting regime efforts to control perception. Many Eritreans have told American diplomats that our human-rights advocacy has given a voice to the voiceless. That is what American diplomacy should seek to do. To its credit, the Biden administration recognizes this. Speaking in Pretoria on August 8, Secretary of State Blinken stressed the U.S. commitment to work with African “partners to tackle 21st century threats to democracy like misinformation, digital surveillance, [and] weaponized corruption” through diplomatic support, including hosting the African Leaders Summit this December, as well as financial assistance under the bipartisan Global Fragility Act, which provides $200 million annually to promote reform and good governance in conflict-prone areas.3. Confrontation is necessary and appropriate. Totalitarian systems need to have an enemy; foreign (usually Western) hostility justifies their repression. We should unapologetically but not hostilely counter totalitarian regimes’ efforts to propagate misinformation, legitimize their repression, and misrepresent Western policies. I decided last fall that we had for too long given the Eritrean propaganda machine a free pass. This neglect had normalized the regime’s human-rights abuses and propaganda. We began countering the regime’s disinformation, especially anti-American propaganda emanating from the information minister’s Twitter feed, on our embassy Facebook page. Public diplomacy typically seeks to focus on “positive” stories. In the case of totalitarian regimes, we should not be fearful of disciplined confrontation. In Eritrea, that approach worked.  4. Totalitarian states are inherently destabilizing and should be isolated and contained. Totalitarian regimes are cancers in the international body politic. It is in their DNA to metastasize. Eritrea is a regional menace. Its decades of destabilizing belligerence—including the Hanish Islands dispute with Yemen in 1995; interference in the Second Sudanese Civil War in 1996–98; the border war with Ethiopia in 1998–2000; border skirmishes with Djibouti in 2008; and alleged assistance to the terrorist al-Shabaab group in Somalia in the mid-2000s—led to UN sanctions in 2009 and 2011. Eritrea’s current military involvement in the conflict in northern Ethiopia, during which Eritrean forces have reportedly looted and committed horrific human-rights abuses, including sexual violence, against civilians, has complicated efforts to stop the fighting and exacerbated an already dire humanitarian crisis. We must accept that with totalitarian regimes, aggression is a question of when, not if, and tailor our diplomatic approaches and calculations accordingly. Our current Eritrea policy of sanctions and isolation is a good template for dealing with totalitarian regimes. We may not be able to stop their aggression, but we can try to contain it.The answer to the question I opened with—why did Eritrea vote “no” on the UN resolutions condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a vote that the information minister, out-Orwelling Orwell, described as “a demonstration of [Eritrea’s] uncompromising stand for peace”?—is that it wanted to punish the U.S. for American sanctions imposed on Eritrea last fall when diplomatic engagement failed to persuade the regime to withdraw its forces from northern Ethiopia. That this came at the expense of fundamental international principles, contradicted Eritrea’s previous public positions, and confirmed Eritrea’s pariah status appears not to have mattered to the Eritrean leadership. This is another aspect of totalitarian regimes: Many are led by mercurial, paranoid, and grievance-nursing sociopaths. Our expectations of success in engaging with people like this should be modest.The point I’m trying to make here is that totalitarianism is still with us, and still evil. The assumptions that underpin traditional notions of diplomacy as the collegial resolution of competing interests do not apply to totalitarian states. My time in Eritrea taught me that confrontation, and not compromise, is the best approach when dealing with these kinds of regimes.[From the December 2021 issue: The bad guys are winning]We diplomats like to think that no problem is too big that it can’t be managed by thoughtful engagement and negotiation. Often that approach is the right one. But it won’t work with the Eritreas of the world. We need to be intellectually prepared for the coming challenges of the emerging international dynamics. When someone shows you who they are, Maya Angelou once warned, believe them the first time. As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine wakes us up to the continuing relevance of the lessons we learned during the Cold War, we would all do well to heed her advice.",

        "description": "Cook courgettes slowly, first by frying, then by simmering in their own juices, before tossing through pasta with salty cheese to tasteThis week’s recipe is the last meal I made in Rome before we left for three weeks in Sicily. In the days before that, we’d been “eating down”. I’m not sure where I picked up this expression, the longer version of which is “eating down the fridge” – that is, eating anything that might go off before a holiday. But pick it up I did, and now it pops up like a cold sore every time I look at the fridge as a holiday approaches. Anyway, things were going well: there was just milk, cherry yoghurt, parmesan that was already quite hard, lettuce for the friend coming to feed the tortoise, and a large courgette left.While a well-stocked fridge is full of possibilities, it also presents you with choices and decisions. A near-empty one, on the other hand, takes responsibility and tells you what to do. Fry the courgette, the fridge said. How? The answer to this is in my still unpublished pamphlet, How to Turn any Vegetable into a Pasta Sauce, a work of six sections: boiling (which is usually followed by dragging), roasting, pounding, dicing, frying and the steamy braise. Steamy braise is the best section, because it is a great approach: fry the vegetable first in oil (not to brown it, but to seal the surface), then add just enough water and salt that the vegetable bubbles and steams away in its own juices. The liquid reduces while the courgette softens and collapses enough to become a sauce. Continue reading...",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3626358-white-house-hopes-august-successes-will-translate-to-fall-momentum/",
        "description": "Democrats think President Biden had a great August&nbsp;and they’re hoping it will translate into momentum for the fall —&nbsp;both legislatively and electorally.\n\n\n\nCongress returns next week after a monthlong recess and Labor Day is considered the unofficial kick-off of the general election campaign season.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden in August signed into law a bipartisan semiconductor bill and a sweeping, Democrat-only package to fight climate change and address health care costs. He announced a drone strike that killed the leader of al Qaeda. The White House cheered positive headlines of gasoline prices declining. And Biden’s poll numbers are starting to inch back up.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Democrats right now, including Biden, just feel confident. It just feels like a wind-at-your-back environment which was not what was anticipated several months ago,” said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way.\n\n\n\nThe president’s approval rating jumped 9 points in a month to 40 percent, according to a new Quinnipiac poll, and a Gallup survey conducted in August found 44 percent of respondents approve of his job as president — the highest figure in a year — after his approval rating hit a record low of 38 percent in July.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Wall Street Journal&nbsp;poll&nbsp;released Thursday found Democrats with a 3-point edge over Republicans when voters were asked which party they’d back in their congressional district if the midterms were held today.\n\n\n\nIvan Zapien, a lobbyist and former official with the Democratic National Committee (DNC), said the current momentum on Biden’s agenda is “great timing” ahead of the midterms in November. Democrats’ chances of holding onto the Senate have grown over the summer as Democrats tick up in the polls while Republican candidates struggle to gain traction in some key states.\n\n\n\n“History’s against Democrats in this election, poll numbers don’t look great, but momentum is everything in politics. So having some momentum going into the elections, I think it’s certainly within the direction you're looking to go into,” Zapien said. “Whether or not that's enough, we'll find out.”\n\n\n\nRepublicans are still widely expected to win back control of the House, however. And Republicans point out that the president’s numbers —&nbsp;an often-used barometer to predict midterm election results —&nbsp;may be improving but remain low.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s a perception of being on a hot streak,” said David Urban, a GOP strategist who served as former President Trump's 2016 senior adviser in Pennsylvania. “His numbers are still in the low 40s.”\n\n\n\nBiden has also endured some criticism from Republicans and moderate Democrats for his decision last month to erase some student loan debt for millions of borrowers, an issue the GOP believes it can use against Biden in the midterms.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe student loan policy, Urban said, “couldn’t have been more divisive.\"\n\n\n\nBiden’s decline in the polls had in part been blamed on months of Democratic infighting around a sweeping domestic policy bill. The measure seemed dead before the announcement of a surprise deal between Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) on a pared down climate, health and tax package.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats believe the passage of that bill — formally known as the Inflation Reduction Act — will help convince voters the party is working to address kitchen table concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“These midterm elections are oftentimes challenging for the party in power, but I have a lot of optimism because we are making tangible progress on issues that really matter,” said Tom Perez, former DNC chairman who is co-chair of the Democratic group American Bridge.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut communicating that progress to voters is the next pressing challenge facing the White House and its surrogates, said John LaBombard, a former senior aide to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.).&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“My view is that my party is traditionally not that great at communicating to the American people in a clear and sustained way what we achieved for them so I would like to see us buck that historic trend to not be distracted by intraparty squabbling or critics who want to focus on what we didn’t get done,” said LaBombard, senior vice president at public affairs agency Rokk.\n\n\n\nThere is still a long time until the midterm election, he said, and three months in politics can feel like a lifetime.\n\n\n\n“I’m hopeful that the momentum is real and it can continue for the next eight or nine weeks, but that’s dependent on Democrats ranging from the progressive left to the moderate middle touting those legislative achievements in a concise and also a sustained way,” LaBombard said.\n\n\n\nNadeam Elshami, former chief of staff to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), said voters historically start to pay attention to midterm elections in the fall. But the Supreme Court decision overturning federal abortion protections and the passage of the health care and climate policy bill got people interested over the summer.\n\n\n\n“All of a sudden August was kind of a month of action. In September, you’re making the case to voters, vote for me because of x or y. You’re not doing that anymore, you’re simply going into September building on what’s already done,” said Elshami, a policy director at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.\n\n\n\nThe recent survey that put Democrats at a 3-point edge over Republicans also found that abortion was a top issue for voters, ahead of the economy and inflation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats also point to signs that the conservative high court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade is energizing the Democratic base ahead the midterms and attracting some independents and Republicans, especially in states where strict laws to restrict abortions are now in place.\n\n\n\n“I still think one of the biggest factors in this election is the overturning of Roe v. Wade,” said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. “It is a game changer.”\n\n\n\nLake described a recent focus group in which female voters described the abortion ruling as a “deal breaker” and accused Republicans of not caring about women.&nbsp;Democrats have outperformed expectations in every special election held since the ruling, including winning two seats in the House.\n\n\n\nBut there are several potential pitfalls this fall that could distract from Democratic victories this summer, including debates on the continuing resolution, funding for Ukraine amid its war with Russia and discussions on how much funding should go toward efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\nFailing to pass a continuing resolution would lead to a government shutdown, which doesn’t bode well for either party in an election year. Meanwhile, the president has been successful in getting funding for Ukraine from Congress but has struggled to get more COVID-19 funding.\n\n\n\nLaBombard also noted there is an opportunity for “more surprises” out of Congress in September, such as codifying marriage equality or movement on electoral reform. He said those would “be really important cherries on top” of an already substantive Congress.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think there’s an outside chance that the Electoral Count Act gets done before the midterms. But I think you’re going to see some spending bills and more nuts and bolts over the next month and I expect the president to have a pretty busy travel schedule because he is no longer box office poison,” Kessler said.\n\n\n\nBiden has been picking up his travel and turning his focus to the 2022 midterm election. As of Monday, he’ll have traveled three times in one week to Pennsylvania — a pivotal state for his 2020 victory that’s home to key midterm races.\n\n\n\nHe delivered a prime-time address from Philadelphia on Thursday characterizing former President Trump and Republicans aligned with him as threats to democracy, making clear his message to voters this fall will not solely turn on policy wins.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“You think that voters in August are not paying attention — that’s always been the political history — but that’s not the case,” Elshami said. “They have been paying attention, and I think that’s why you’re seeing the momentum within the Democratic voters throughout, heading into September.”",

        "description": "Prize-winning&nbsp;author&nbsp;Toni Morrison famously joked that&nbsp;President&nbsp;Clinton’s style and ability to&nbsp;deliver for&nbsp;Black people&nbsp;made him the first&nbsp;Black president.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy Morrison’s logic,&nbsp;Joe Biden&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;third&nbsp;Black president&nbsp;— with President Obama as the second.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresident&nbsp;Biden’s&nbsp;vice president is a&nbsp;Black woman and he put the first&nbsp;Black woman on the Supreme Court.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd as the midterms approach,&nbsp;Biden’s work to reduce student debt and lower drug prices&nbsp;are&nbsp;big wins for&nbsp;Black Americans, especially&nbsp;given the&nbsp;racial&nbsp;wealth&nbsp;gap.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut&nbsp;Biden’s most&nbsp;potentially&nbsp;enduring&nbsp;political&nbsp;victory for&nbsp;Black people&nbsp;is&nbsp;taking shape&nbsp;in this year’s midterms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA&nbsp;record number of&nbsp;Black&nbsp;candidates&nbsp;are in position to&nbsp;win&nbsp;U.S. Senate races.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere are four states where&nbsp;Black Senate candidates are playing a key role&nbsp;in&nbsp;Biden’s&nbsp;effort to prevent the GOP taking majority control of the Senate:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFlorida, where&nbsp;Rep. Val Demings&nbsp;(D)&nbsp;is taking on GOP incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGeorgia, where&nbsp;incumbent&nbsp;Democrat&nbsp;Sen. Raphael Warnock, the state’s first&nbsp;Black senator, is&nbsp;facing&nbsp;a&nbsp;Black Republican, Herschel Walker.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina, with former&nbsp;state&nbsp;Supreme Court Justice Cheri Beasley&nbsp;(D)&nbsp;facing Republican Rep. Ted Budd.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWisconsin, with Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes&nbsp;(D)&nbsp;running to unseat Sen. Ron Johnson&nbsp;(R).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs we go into these races, keep in mind that&nbsp;never have&nbsp;more than three&nbsp;Black people been among the nation’s 100 senators.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOnly 11&nbsp;Black people have ever served in the U.S. Senate. The prospect of six together would be history.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf&nbsp;the three first-time candidates win and Warnock is reelected,&nbsp;they will double the number of&nbsp;Black people currently in the&nbsp;Senate. Right now,&nbsp;Warnock&nbsp;is&nbsp;joined by&nbsp;Sens.&nbsp;Cory Booker&nbsp;(D-N.J.)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tim Scott&nbsp;(R-S.C.).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut in the possible post-midterms&nbsp;scenario,&nbsp;five of the six would&nbsp;be Democrats serving under&nbsp;Biden,&nbsp;a president&nbsp;with 68 percent approval among&nbsp;Black voters in an August NBC poll. That would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;historic step forward.&nbsp;Black priorities&nbsp;would&nbsp;be better represented than ever before at&nbsp;the highest levels of the national government.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGoing into the final campaign stretch before the midterms, the&nbsp;Georgia race,&nbsp;featuring&nbsp;two&nbsp;Black candidates,&nbsp;is getting the most attention.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut to my eye&nbsp;the most fascinating race is in Florida.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemings,&nbsp;a&nbsp;Black woman and&nbsp;former police chief,&nbsp;is&nbsp;challenging&nbsp;Rubio,&nbsp;a&nbsp;Latino&nbsp;who was once thought&nbsp;of as a&nbsp;future president.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSeveral polls show Rubio up by a modest amount.&nbsp;But&nbsp;Demings has the potential to grow her support, in part because many voters across the state don’t know her yet.&nbsp;She&nbsp;has raised more money than Rubio,&nbsp;giving her the ability to launch a strong TV campaign and raise her profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne big surprise is that&nbsp;Demings&nbsp;holds the lead&nbsp;among independent voters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina offers another surprising opportunity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBeasley&nbsp;is&nbsp;close to&nbsp;tied&nbsp;in her race against Budd, according to&nbsp;the FiveThirtyEight average of recent polls in the state.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe race in Georgia is also close.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn average of polls shows Warnock&nbsp;in&nbsp;the lead,&nbsp;but it is within the margin of error.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAbout one-third&nbsp;of&nbsp;eligible&nbsp;voters in Georgia are&nbsp;Black. A recent poll by&nbsp;SurveyUSA for Atlanta TV station WXIA&nbsp;found 85 percent of&nbsp;Black&nbsp;voters in the state back Warnock. Only 5 percent favor Walker, a former football star with no political background.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWarnock won the seat in&nbsp;an early 2021 runoff election&nbsp;by two percentage points.&nbsp;In November 2020,&nbsp;Biden won the state by less than a percentage point.&nbsp;Trump then pressured Georgia officials to “find”&nbsp;enough&nbsp;votes to overturn his defeat.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn Wisconsin, Barnes holds the lead over Johnson. But it is a close race with an August&nbsp;Fox News poll&nbsp;giving Barnes a 50&nbsp;percent to 46&nbsp;percent lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Marquette University Law School&nbsp;poll had Barnes up on Johnson by 7 percentage points, 51-44,&nbsp;with a margin of error&nbsp;of&nbsp;4.2 percentage points.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut “regardless of the specificity of those numbers,” University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee emeritus&nbsp;professor Mordecai Lee told Wisconsin Public Radio, “we should all just agree this is an even race.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bottom line is that there is a real chance for all four of the&nbsp;Black&nbsp;Senate candidates to win and make history.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut&nbsp;they are&nbsp;also&nbsp;dependent&nbsp;on&nbsp;strong&nbsp;turnout&nbsp;among&nbsp;Black voters to overcome Republicans, who have lots of money and fervent support from conservative media.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s&nbsp;push&nbsp;to cut student debt and lower prescription drug prices is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;raise&nbsp;Black&nbsp;voter&nbsp;enthusiasm&nbsp;this&nbsp;fall.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIncreased&nbsp;turnout among young&nbsp;Black voters, a cohort with a tendency not to vote in midterms, is going to be a factor.&nbsp;They have a reason to vote with Biden’s student loan relief plan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen Biden won the 2020 presidential&nbsp;race,&nbsp;he thanked&nbsp;Black voters&nbsp;who, he told the nation,&nbsp;“stood&nbsp;up again for me.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“They always have my back, and I’ll have yours,” Biden said in his victory speech.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLooks like he was serious.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJuan Williams is an&nbsp;author,&nbsp;and a political analyst for Fox News Channel.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Printworks, LondonAnthony Roth Costanzo’s neon-lit ‘operatic experience’ brought together Handel and Philip Glass plus dancers, a painter … and films of erotic puddingsAnother week, another foray beyond BBC Proms HQ. The latest Prom to leave the Royal Albert Hall was an “operatic experience” at Printworks London – once the largest printing factory in western Europe, and since 2017 reincarnated as a massive club and gig venue. It’s the kind of cavernous space that generates its own electric atmosphere long before any performance starts. (More’s the pity that this first Prom at the Printworks will also be the last: the entire complex is now set to close to allow for “redevelopment”.) As we stood waiting for the start in neon-shot darkness, an electronic soundscape of breathing – or perhaps it was the wind or the sea? – mingled with whispers of bafflement.Bafflement turned out to be essential to this event masterminded by countertenor and operatic uber-showman Anthony Roth Costanzo in collaboration with English National Opera. Handel arias alternated with chunks of Philip Glass, punctuated by ear-bending beatboxing by Jason Singh, all subtle purrs and rattles, clicks and pops. Short films were projected on to the walls, minutely synched to the music: a Monty Python-ish medieval knight; dogs playing (leaping in comical slow-motion for one of Handel’s heart-wrenching slow sections); an adolescent girl weeping on a runway in a desert; a surreal sequence of erotic puddings, cigarettes and sausages in lurid 1960s colour.

Three years later they finally met for the first time …When Alison’s husband died in 2010, she wrote to one of his oldest friends to let him know. Although she had never met Michael she knew he had been a close friend of her partner and, sure enough, he immediately wrote back. As well as reminiscing about her husband, Alison and Michael – now 83 and 92 – opened up about their own lives, too. “We shared our history and I learned that Mike played the violin and flute,” says Alison. “At Christmas he told me he was dancing round the kitchen to Bach with my letter in his hands.”“Alison’s letters were something to look forward to,” says Michael, who at the time was living in Sheffield and caring for his wife, who had dementia. “I was very busy and only used to take two hours a week for myself. She was so nice and we had a lot in common. We soon discovered we had the same values and politics.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "Scores, news, and notes, from around the Detroit Tigers’ farm system for Sunday, September 4, 2022. Toledo Mud Hens 6, Rochester Red Wings 3 (box)\nThe Mud Hens took down the Red Wings again on Sunday, completely a 5-1 series victory with a strong performance from the bullpen.\nJoey Wentz made another short start in this one, as the Tigers remain careful with him following a nearly two month absence in the middle of the season for shoulder trouble. Wentz allowed a run on five hits and a walk over three innings of work, with three strikeouts. Zac Houston took over in the fourth, but surrendered a pair of runs in the bottom of the fifth, departing in favor of Cody Sedlock. \nThe Hens staked Wentz to an early lead when Brendon Davis doubled home Ali Sanchez in the top of the first. They added another on Daz Cameron’s third inning double, which scored John Valente. Sanchez was cut down at the plate trying to score behind Valente. They put the game away in the fifth when Dylan Rosa led off with a solo shot, and Valente and Sanchez followed with singles. After a Red Wings pitching change, Cameron popped out, but Davis singled in Valente and advanced Sanchez to third. An Andre Lipcius fly ball allowed Sanchez to tag up and score from third. At that point it was 5-1.\nHouston’s two runs in the bottom of the fifth allowed Rochester to close the gap, but a Daz Cameron sac fly in the sixth scored Jack Lopez, and gave the Hens their final margin of victory.\nSanchez: 3-5, 2 R, SO\nDavis: 2-4, 2 RBI, 2B, BB, SO\nRosa: 1-3, R, RBI, HR, BB, SO\nWentz: 3.0 IP, ER, 5 H, BB, 3 SO\nComing Up Next: The Hens are now 70-57 on the year, but remain 8.5 games behind Nashville in the International League West. They’ll come home to battle the St. Paul Saints starting Tuesday night with a doubleheader beginning at 5:05 p.m. EDT.\nErie SeaWolves 5, Bowie Baysox 4 (box)\nAnother big game for both Parker Meadows and Gage Workman helped carry them over the Baysox on Sunday, and split the six-game set. As a result, the two clubs remain knotted atop the Eastern League’s Southwest division with 12 games left on the schedule. \nChance Kirby got the start, and for six innings he dominated the Baysox. The SeaWolves’ offense was slow to get rolling, but broke through with a three-run fifth inning. One-out singles from Trei Cruz and Bryant Packard, who had a three-hit game, got some traffic on the bases for Erie and Gage Workman and Parker Meadows came up with back-to-back singles to make it 3-0. \nThey almost opened it up even further when Dane Myers led off the sixth with a double. A wild pitch allowed Myers to move to third, but he was thrown out at home trying to score on a Dillon Dingler ground ball. Daniel Cabrera followed Dingler with a single, and they had runners first and third with one out, but Cruz grounded into a double play to end the inning.\nKirby came back out for the seventh, but that proved too much to ask as he quickly gave up a pair of singles and then a three-run shot. Brendan White took over and shut things down, but the game was all tied up. However, Packard led off the bottom half with a double, and eventually scored on a Meadows’ ground out to re-open a one-run lead. \nThe ninth inning proved to be an adventure. Elvis Alvardo took from White and allowed a Coby Mayo solo shot that tied the game. However, Packard again led off with a hit, a single this time, and with one out he took second on a wild pitch. Workman drew a walk and Meadows came up with a single on a hot shot back to the pitcher that deflected. With the bases loaded, Quincy Nieporte lifted a fly ball to right field, and Packard tagged up and scored the walkoff game winner.\nMeadows: 3-5, 2 RBI, 2B, SB\nPackard: 3-4, 3 R, 2B\nWorkman: 1-4, R, RBI, BB, 2 SO\nComing Up Next: The SeaWolves welcome in the Altoona Curve starting Tuesday night.\nWest Michigan Whitecaps 9, Fort Wayne TinCaps 4 (box)\nNeeding a big series to keep pace with the Midwest League East division leaders, the Lake County Captains, the West Michigan Whitecaps got it done, taking down the TinCaps 5-1 in this six-game set to stay just two back of Lake County.\nThe offense came out landing jabs and then haymakers early on, putting Fort Wayne in a 7-2 hole by the end of the third inning. In the top of the first, Jace Jung walked with one out and moved first to third on a Jonathan Schoop single. An Izaac Pacheco sac fly scored Jung, and the Whitecaps had an early 1-0 lead.\nIn the second, Justice Bigbie singled with one out. Carlos Mendoza followed with a single and Eduardo Valencia walked to load the bases. A wild pitch allowed Bigbie to race home to make it 2-0. \nFort Wayne tied it up with a single and a two-run homer against starter Matt Walker, but he settled in to throw three more scoreless innings as the Whitecaps blew the game open. A huge five-run third inning sealed the deal. Schoop led off with a walk and moved to third on a Pacheco single. An error on Fort Wayne’s shortstop allowed Austin Murr to reach, and Schoop to score, and then a walk to Bigbie loaded the bases. A wild pitch scored Pacheco, and a two-run single from Mendoza followed. They got one more on a Jung single, before Schoop grounded out as the 10th batter of the inning. \nJung came up with another RBI single in the seventh as the Whitecaps added two more runs to put this one to bed.\nJung: 2-4, R, 2 RBI, 2 BB, SO\nMendoza: 3-5, 2 RBI, SO\nPacheco: 1-3, R, RBI, BB, SO\nComing Up Next: It’ll be tough to catch Lake County from a two game deficit with only six to play, but the Whitecaps will look to take it to the Great Lakes Loons at home this week to keep the pressure on the division leading Captains.\nLakeland Flying Tigers 12, Clearwater Threshers 7 (box)\nAfter getting rained out most of the series, the Flying Tigers won on Sunday to split what became a two-game set. \nThings did not look good early on, as the Threshers hammered starter Joe Miller, the Tigers 11th round pick in July’s amateur draft. A pair of errors from Iverson Leonardo in left and Adinso Reyes at third, didn’t help matters, but ultimately the Threshers scored five in the second inning after getting one in the first as well. Down 6-0 already, the Flying Tigers got to work in the bottom of the second. Andrew Jenkins led off with a walk and advanced on a wild pitch. Jose De La Cruz drew a walk as well, and Dom Johnson doubled in Jenkins. De La Cruz and Johnson scored on a Leonardo single to right, and it was 6-3. \nAfter a quiet third, the Flying Tigers poured it on in the fourth to take the lead. With two outs, Johnson singled and stole second, and Alonzo Rubalcaba singled him home. A wild pitch moved Rubalcaba to second and Leonardo walked as Threshers pitcher Nicoly Pina completely lost his control. Another wild pitch advanced them both 90 feet, and then Pina walked Cristian Santana and hit Luke Gold, scoring Rubalcaba. That left it to Manuel Sequera, who singled to left to score Leonardo and Santana. 7-6 Lakeland. \nThis one more or less ended in the bottom of the fifth, as the Threshers issued four straight walks to start the inning. Santana and Sequera each came up with RBI singles as the Flying Tigers scored five runs to make it 12-6. Clearwater got a run in the seventh, but otherwise the bullpen was solid the rest of the way.\nSequera: 3-5, 3 RBI, SO\nJohnson: 2-3, 3 R, RBI, 2B, BB, SO\nSantana: 1-4, 2 R, RBI, BB, SO\nComing Up Next: The Flying Tigers will travel to Jupiter to battle the Hammerheads starting Tuesday night.",

What’s new? At least they didn’t get shut out, as JT Riddle drove in Mark Vientos in the ninth. They might’ve scored a second run, as Khalil Lee was at third, but Gosuke Katoh hit a liner right at the first baseman to end the game with an unassisted double play.

With the win, the Cyclones have leap-frogged the Hudson Valley and stand alone in first place, a half-game ahead of the Renegades. The Cyclones scored early and often, plating 3 in the first and another 6 in the third. Benito Garcia and Daniel Juarez ran into some trouble in the ninth, allowing four runs, but with such a large lead, those runs were merely a blip on the radar, a passing cloud in a sunny sky.\nWith their 4-2 series win, the Cyclones have won 10 of their last 12 and will look to keep their winning ways going against the Winston-Salem Dash in the final regular season series of 2022. The Renegades, meanwhile, will be playing the Blue Rocks.\n\nLF Matt Rudick: 0-3, 2 R, BB\nLF Gregory Guerrero: 0-1, K\nCF Alex Ramirez: 1-4, R, RBI, BB, K\n1B JT Schwartz: 2-4, 2 R, 2B, RBI, K, HBP\n2B Jose Peroza: 1-3, R, RBI, K, E (6)\n2B Justin Guerrera: 1-1, R, HR (2), 2 RBI\nRF Stanley Consuegra: 2-4, R, 2 RBI, HBP\nC Jose Mena: 0-4, K\n3B William Lugo: 2-3, R, 2 RBI, BB, K\nDH Joe Suozzi: 2-4, R, 3B, RBI\nSS Shervyen Newton: 0-3, R, BB, K\nRHP Mike Vasil: 3.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K\nRHP Junior Santos: 3.0 IP, 3 H, 1 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 3 K, BLK, W (8-12)\nRHP Benito Garcia: 2.2 IP, 4 H, 4 R, 4 ER, 0 BB, 3 K, HBP, H (1)\nRHP Daniel Juarez: 0.0 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 0 K\nRHP Dylan Hall: 0.1 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K\n\n\nSingle-A: St. Lucie Mets (31-28/71-53)\n\nST. LUCIE 8, JUPITER 3 (BOX)\nD’Andre Smith put the Mets on the board with a solo shot in the bottom of the second off a 2-2 breaking ball, but the Hammerheads quickly got it back after Marlins prospect Khalil Watson tripled and was driven home in the top of the third. In the bottom of the frame, Kevin Parada plated a pair and for a while, it looked like that 3-1 lead might stick, but Jupiter tied things up in the seventh. In the bottom of the inning, Jupiter reliever Dale Stanavich replaced Cade Gibson and proceeded to let all hell break loose, walking the bases loaded and then walking in the go-ahead run. His replacement, Yeuris Jimenez, didn’t fare much better, allowing an RBI single and walking in two more runs. All in all, St. Lucie scored five runs in the inning, giving them a commanding lead they’d hang on to. The win wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows however, as Omar De Los Santos left the game apparently hurt after sliding headfirst into second in the bottom of the first and injuring his right hand.\n\nCF Omar De Los Santos: 1-1, CS (15)\nCF Tanner Murphy: 0-3, R, BB, K\nDH Kevin Parada: 2-3, R, 2 RBI, 2 BB, K\nSS Junior Tilien: 0-4, R, RBI, BB\n3B Chase Estep: 1-5, R, 2 RBI, 2 K\n2B D’Andre Smith: 2-3, R, HR (2), RBI, HBP\nRF Carlos Dominguez: 0-3, RBI, BB, 2 K\n1B Brad Malm: 0-4, 3 K\nC Oscar Campos: 2-2, R\nC Raul Beracierta: 0-0, R, RBI, 2 BB\nLF Rhylan Thomas: 0-3, R\nRHP Joander Suarez: 4.0 IP, 5 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 0 BB, 5 K\nRHP Felipe De La Cruz: 2.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 3 K\nRHP Joshua Cornielly: 2.0 IP, 4 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 1 BB, 1 K, WP, W (5-3), BS (4)\nRHP Dylan Tebrake: 1.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K\n\n\nComplex: FCL Mets (33-22)\n\nNO GAME (SEASON OVER)\nStar of the Night\nGoat of the Night",

The alveoli &#x2014; the sac-like pockets where this process takes place &#x2014; will fill with mucus and harden until, in Stephen&#x2019;s disturbing phrase, the lungs &#x201C;turn to stone.&#x201D;Read the rest&hellip;",

It’s the fictional story of a band of heroic British soldiers on a mission to rescue an American scientist and his atomic bomb research from the Germans. It’s mostly well-acted, and director Giles Alderson makes the best of what looks like a limited budget. But I’m on the fence about leading man Ed Westwick: his cheekbones and pout, so useful playing conceited rich boy Chuck Bass in Gossip Girl, don’t exactly scream grizzled war hero.

The final season of Game of Thrones cost $15 million an episode — something fans could only dream of in terms of production value — but it couldn’t buy a plot fix. Getting back to telling stories that are well-written, around characters who are fully fleshed out, is more powerful than the biggest budget in the room. Let’s hope the next era of television understands this. \n\nFrom your lips to the TV gods’ ears. ",

Seeing as I take holiday weeks off, I thought I could use the opportunity going forward to share the work of other food and culture writers with newsletters. Today, kicking it off, is Page Page, an artist in Northampton, Massachusetts, whose newsletter Mood Salad and connected Instagram page bring me a lot of joy&#8212;Page is enthusiastic and engaged with what she eats, her local food systems and farms, and presents it beautifully. Thank you, always, for reading. I&#8217;ll be back in full next week. &#8212;AliciaBuying a Loaf of BreadOriginally published at Mood Salad on December 18, 2021Joe and I were driving home from Hadley yesterday. We drove over the Connecticut River, through steady holiday traffic. I looked across at the lumpy peaks and valleys of small mountains in the distance. A peripheral daydream, a home for me. Even as a kid, carsick in the backseat, I remained astonished by this view. The land in early winter is so purple that it is green. The water is just a shiver of a color. The car we were driving in was hot from sunlight alone. An overwhelming hot experience, like starting a fire by shining light through a magnifying glass. Once I noticed my burning face, I could appreciate it. Before then, it just felt like a headache. I noticed the heat halfway across the bridge. I turned to Joe and said:Would it be nice to pick up a loaf of bread?Yes, Joe said.So we had something to look forward to. Saliva wet my mouth in preparation. We didn&#8217;t have any anxious conversation about whether or not we could afford it, like we usually do. For a moment, there was only winter light burning our faces through the dashboard, and our excitement. There was no new variant, no cancelled plans, no shallow breath beside a mask-less stranger, no visions of the very scary future, no memory of the difficult past. Like another dimension, not the 3rd, not the 4th, not the moment even.mood.saladA post shared by @mood.saladIn slow motion. I&#8217;ve always known - a miracle comes only in this frame of mind. When above, below, behind, ahead, is made dense with fear.We parked behind the bakery. Joe wasn&#8217;t sure it was open. But the moment we opened the car doors we knew. The sweetest alchemy. The smell alone filled me the way a meal could. As if we had opened the doors, and suddenly in the parking lot, we were surrounded by the voices of an ancient choir. And it felt like the song of the choir was coming from inside of us. It was that familiar, it was my great great grandmother&#8217;s favorite song. The wood burning oven, and the wild yeast, fermented by its intimacy with the baker&#8217;s hands. The honey that got it going, the salt that was measured by weight.We stood outside in line, behind a woman who bought one of everything. Of course, I immediately made up stories about the family she was heading home to. A nuclear family who reads newspapers, goes skiing, enjoys the good things in life so routinely. I couldn&#8217;t wait for my turn in line. I didn&#8217;t like making assumptions about this stranger.A hand appeared out the window, and pushed loaves of bread wrapped in brown paper into her open arms.&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s warm,&#8221; she said, and jumped a little in surprise. I didn&#8217;t register what she said, but realized then that I wasn&#8217;t wearing a jacket. And actually, without the magnified light of the dashboard, I was very cold.After she paid, she stepped aside and Joe and I walked up to the window. The person at the register squatted down to fit in the window frame. It looked like an expression of joy, but it was hard to discern, because they were working.Joe asked for a loaf of rosemary bread. A moment later, it was wrapped in paper, and in my arms. We paid and walked away. It was warm, and I was surprised, even though I knew it would be. I just rejoiced in the warmth. I wanted to stand outside a moment longer, to be warmed by the bread. The power of the contrast. It was so warm, it was hot. I asked Joe to feel it. I think he was happy, we both smiled.Miracle comes from the Latin miraculum, meaning &#8216;object of wonder.&#8217; Back in the car, we pulled the bread apart. The crust was perfectly light. Streams of steam floated out, as easy going as incense. The car filled with rosemary. I took a bite, and it tasted better than I thought was possible.I chewed carefully, avoiding the thicker stalks of rosemary. I have a hard time talking when I&#8217;m eating, because I am quick to choke. So when we eat, Joe always says &#8220;I love you, you don&#8217;t have to say it back.&#8221; Joe said it right then, while we were chewing. I knew he would.I suddenly realized my wealth. Rich as the stranger in front of us in line, buying each kind of bread. Quick to label her spoiled, quick to resent all that she has. To pity her too, for the excess I assumed she takes for granted.Object of wonder. As a noun, wonder means &#8220;A feeling of surprise mingled with admiration, caused by something beautiful, unexpected, unfamiliar, or inexplicable.&#8221;The warmth of the bread was such a surprise, but the bread itself was as familiar as my own body. Each loaf of bread comes out of the oven warm. It should come as no surprise.A recent recipe work photo from my kitchen.Subscribe now",

        "title": "Lowering the Cost of Insulin Could Be Deadly",
        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/09/diabetes-medication-insulin-cost/671333/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "When I heard that my patient was back in the ICU, my heart sank. But I wasn’t surprised. Her paycheck usually runs short at the end of the month, so her insulin does too. As she stretches her supply, her blood sugar climbs. Soon the insatiable thirst and constant urination follow. And once her keto acids build up, her stomach pains and vomiting start. She always manages to make it to the hospital before the damage reaches her brain and heart. But we both worry that someday, she won’t.The Inflation Reduction Act, passed last month, aims to help people like her by lowering the cost of insulin across America. Although efforts to expand protections to privately insured Americans were blocked in the Senate, Democrats succeeded in capping expenses for the drug among Americans on Medicare at $35 a month, offering meaningful savings for our seniors, some of whom will save hundreds of dollars a month thanks to the measure. In theory, the policy (and similar ones at the state level) will help the estimated 25 percent of Americans on insulin who have been forced to ration the drug because of cost, and will prevent some of the 600 annual American deaths from diabetic ketoacidosis, the fate from which I’m trying to save my patient.Indeed, laws capping co-payments for insulin are welcome news both financially and medically to patients who depend on the drug for survival. However, in their current version, such laws might backfire, leading to even more diabetes-related deaths overall.How could that be true? Thanks to the development of new drugs, insulin’s role in diabetes treatment has been declining over the past decade. It remains essential to the small percent of patients with type 1 diabetes, including my patient. But for the 90 percent of Americans with diabetes who have type 2, it should not routinely be the first-, second-, or even third-line treatment. The reasons for this are many: Of all diabetes medications, insulin carries the highest risk of causing dangerously low blood sugar. The medication most commonly comes in injectable form, so administering it usually means painful needle jabs. All of this effort is rewarded with (usually unwanted) weight gain. Foremost and finally, although insulin is excellent at tamping down high blood sugar—the hallmark of diabetes and the driver of some of its complications—it is not as impressive as other medications at mitigating the most deadly and debilitating consequences of the disease: heart attacks, kidney disease, and heart failure.[Read: People are clamoring to buy old insulin pumps]Large clinical trials have shown that two newer classes of diabetes medicines, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, outperform alternatives (including insulin) in reducing the risk of these disabling or deadly outcomes. Giving patients these drugs instead of older options over a period of three years prevents, on average, one death for about every 100 treated. And SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists pose less risk of causing dangerously low blood sugar, generally do not require frequent injections, and help patients lose weight. Based on these data, the American Diabetes Association now recommends SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists be used before insulin for most patients with type 2 diabetes.When a young person dies from diabetic ketoacidosis because they rationed insulin, the culprit is clear. But when a patient with diabetes dies of a heart attack, the absence of an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist doesn’t get blamed, because other explanations abound: their uncontrolled blood pressure, the cholesterol medication they didn’t take, the cigarettes they continued to smoke, bad genes, bad luck. But every year, more than 1,000 times more Americans die of heart disease than DKA, and of those 700,000 deaths, a good chunk are diabetes-related. (The exact number remains murky.) Diabetes is a major reason that more than half a million Americans depend on dialysis to manage their end-stage kidney disease, and that about 6 million live with congestive heart failure. The data are clear—SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists could help reduce these numbers.Still, uptake of these lifesaving drugs is sluggish. Only about one in 10 people with type 2 diabetes is taking them (fewer still among patients who are not wealthy or white). The main cause is simple and stupid: American laws prioritize profits and patents over patients. Because SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists remain under patent protections, drug companies can charge exorbitant rates for them: hundreds if not thousands of dollars a month, sometimes even more than insulin. Doctors spend hours completing arduous paperwork in the hopes of persuading insurers to help our patients, but we’re frequently denied anyway. And even when we do succeed, many patients are left with painful co-payments and deductibles. The most maddening part is that despite their substantial up-front expense, these medications are quite cost-effective in the long run because they prevent pricey complications down the road.[Read: The risks of over-the-counter diabetes treatments]This is where addressing the cost of insulin—and only insulin—becomes problematic. Doctors are forced daily to decide between the best medication for our patients and the medication that our patients can afford. Katie Shaw, a primary-care physician with a bustling practice at Johns Hopkins, where I’m a senior resident, told me that plenty of her patients can’t afford SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists. In such instances, Shaw is forced to use older oral alternatives and occasionally insulin. “They’re better than nothing at all,” she said.If the cost of insulin is capped on its own, insulin will be more likely to jump in front of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in treatment plans. That will mean more disease, more disability, and more death from diabetes.Medicare patients might avoid some of these effects thanks to provisions in the IRA allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and capping out-of-pocket spending on prescriptions at $2,000 a year. The law also guarantees price negotiations for a handful of medications, but SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists won’t necessarily be on the list. And most Americans are not on Medicare. Already, Shaw said, the patients in her practice who tend to be least able to afford SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are working-class people with private insurance. Some health centers, including the one Shaw and I work at, enjoy access to a federal drug-discount program that can make patent-protected medications, including SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, more affordable for the uninsured. But most Americans without insurance aren’t so lucky.It would be cruel to choose between a world in which more people with type 2 diabetes are nudged toward a drug that won’t stave off the most dangerous complications, and one in which those with type 1 diabetes are priced out of life. In place of capping the out-of-pocket cost of just insulin, lawmakers should cap the out-of-pocket cost of all diabetes medications. This will both protect Americans dependent on insulin and smooth SGLT2 inhibitors’ and GLP-1 receptor agonists’ path to their revolutionary public-health potential.[Read: Big Pharma’s go-to defense of soaring drug prices doesn’t add up]The argument for lowering the cost of these drugs for patients is the same as the argument for insulin affordability: that it is both foolish and inhumane to make lifesaving diabetes medications unaffordable when their use prevents costly and deadly downstream complications.Patients like mine need affordable access to insulin. But even more need access to SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists. If the laws stop at insulin, many Americans could die unnecessarily—not from inadequate access to insulin, but from preferential access to it.",

        "description": "Mitch Stringer-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Orioles, 2.5 games behind Toronto for the final wild card spot, begin a four-game series with the Jays with a doubleheader today. This is the big one, folks. Good morning, Camden Chatters.\nThere’s no underselling it. These next three days at Camden Yards could well make or break the Orioles’ 2022 postseason hopes. The O’s haven’t played September games this meaningful in half a decade.\nThe Toronto Blue Jays, currently 2.5 games ahead of the Orioles for the third and final wild card spot, come to Baltimore today for what promises to be a tense, hard-fought, bare-knuckle brawl, an unforgiving four-game series packed into three days beginning with a doubleheader this afternoon.\nThe Birds’ costly loss to the Athletics yesterday put them on their heels, but they’re not out of the hunt yet. Still, their margin for error is slim. At this point only a four-game sweep of the Blue Jays would move the O’s into playoff position by the end of the series. But taking three out of four would gain them valuable ground. Anything less than that is going to make it real difficult for the Orioles to close the gap on the Jays in the season’s final weeks.\nThere’s so much riding on this series, and the Jays will be no easy opponent. But the surprising 2022 Orioles have risen to nearly every challenge they’ve faced this year. Can they do it again?\nLinks\nOrioles lose ground in wild-card race with 5-0 loss to A’s; ‘Massive’ series against Blue Jays begins Monday - BaltimoreBaseball.comMike Baumann is joining the Orioles to start one of today’s games, five days before his (and my) birthday. Let’s get this birthday week started on the right foot, Mike!\nAdley Rutschman lives up to the hype for surprising Baltimore Orioles - USA TodayIt’s USA Today’s turn to notice how good the Orioles have been. Gabe Lacques pegs the O’s as having a “limitless future.” I like the sound of that.\nAfter Turning Down Red Sox, Jud Fabian Envisions ‘Chance To Win Multiple World Series’ With Orioles - PressBoxApparently even in Low-A, Jud Fabian is getting booed by Red Sox fans for not signing with Boston last year. Here’s hoping he gives Red Sox fans plenty more reasons to boo after he reaches the majors.\nOrioles birthdays and history\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday! And happy 87th birthday to catcher Tom Patton, who appeared in one major league game for the Orioles in 1957. That’s one more than most of us ever will, so kudos to him. Enjoy your day, Mr. Patton. Also celebrating birthdays today are former O’s right-handers Calvin Maduro (48) and Jimmy Haynes (50).\nThe Orioles’ last win on this date came last year, when they came back from a late-inning deficit to beat the Yankees in New York, 8-7. Trailing 5-2 in the sixth, the O’s collected four runs and six hits off Andrew Heaney to take the lead, and relievers Marcos Diplan, Tanner Scott, and Tyler Wells worked the final three scoreless innings to seal the win. Even after the victory, the Orioles’ record stood at 43-92. Let me repeat that: just one year ago on this date, the Orioles were 43-92. They are now 71-62.\nThe Orioles also beat the Yankees on this date in 2017, rallying from an early 6-1 deficit thanks to four home runs, capped by Manny Machado’s walkoff, two-run blast in the ninth, his second of the game. The win was the 1,500th of Buck Showalter’s managerial career, and it pulled the Orioles within one game of a wild card spot. How exciting! Except that, the next day, the O’s began a six-game losing streak that knocked them out of playoff contention and under .500 for good.\nAnd on September 5, 1995, Cal Ripken Jr. took his place alongside Lou Gehrig, tying the Iron Horse’s incredible consecutive games record at 2,130 (the tie, of course, was short-lived, as Cal dethroned Gehrig the next day). In front of 46,804 raucous fans at Camden Yards — including a 12-year-old me — Cal went 3-for-5 with a home run, one of six O’s dingers in an 8-0 rout of the Angels.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3624372-bidens-student-loan-bailout-treats-hard-working-americans-as-chumps-on-labor-day/",
        "description": "President Biden’s plan to forgive up to $20,000 of student loans per borrower is bad policy for numerous reasons. It adds nearly $1 trillion to the national debt. It fuels inflation. And it is illegal executive overreach. (The Job Creators Network Foundation’s Legal Action Fund is currently considering legal options to block it.)\n\n\n\nThe bailout is also fundamentally unfair to most Americans who never earned an associate’s or bachelor’s degree. These hard-working folks are forced to shoulder loan forgiveness for the consultant class through their tax dollars. Biden’s action, therefore, makes for an especially depressing Labor Day for ordinary workers who also face declining real wages and living standards because of historic inflation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOver the Labor Day weekend, the media targeted these everyday wage-earners with a heavy dose of pro-union messaging, championing the supposed triumphant return of the labor movement that’s always just around the corner. They ignored how student loan forgiveness is far more unjust to workers than any supposed remaining labor abuses. The bailout’s inequality-inducing wealth transfer from ordinary workers to higher-income households should enrage supposedly pro-worker politicians, union bosses, and journalists who apparently have put partisanship above their ideals.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore broadly, the student loan bailout doesn’t address the underlying reason why so many Americans have crushing student debt in the first place. Between 2008-09 and 2020-21, tuition increased by 54 percent (26 percent, adjusted for inflation). Some middling private universities, such as Kenyon College in Ohio, Skidmore College in New York, and Bates College in Maine, now cost more than $80,000 a year to attend.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bailout does nothing to reverse these runaway college costs, keeping higher education off-limits for many blue-collar families. As a result, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget concludes that college debt levels will return to today’s level within five years.\n\n\n\nEven some prominent Democrats concede this point. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) said the action “doesn’t address the root problems that make college unaffordable.” Sen. Micahel Bennet (D-Colo.) said, “One-time debt cancellation does not solve the underlying problem.” And the Wall Street Journal quotes one Democratic House member as saying her colleagues are “frustrated that it doesn’t actually solve the college cost issue.”\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, government action that merely addresses the effect of a problem, rather than its cause, is standard practice. By only managing symptoms, policymakers allow the underlying disease to fester, exacerbating the problems they’re trying to solve.\n\n\n\nNowhere is this dynamic more apparent than in labor policy, activism for which filled the editorial pages of most major newspapers this weekend. Major Democrat labor policy proposals such as a $15 federal minimum wage, curtailing independent contracting, and forcing unionization through policies like card check attempt to address perceived insufficient workplace pay and benefits.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYet they ignore the underlying reasons for this problem. These include reckless spending that’s fueling inflation and reducing real wages, a lack of hard skills among workers, and over-taxation and over-regulation, whose costs are partly paid for in terms of reduced employee compensation. Democrats’ heavy-handed policies to try to address the consequences of these problems would only exacerbate them by reducing economic opportunities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe recently passed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) also includes examples of this phenomenon. Consider the $7,500 subsidy extension for electric vehicle purchases. These taxpayer funds are intended to make these “green” cars and trucks more affordable. But in reality, they simply enable automakers to raise their prices. Witness how Ford and GM recently increased their sticker prices on some electric vehicles by approximately this subsidy amount. This IRA provision, therefore, effectively subsidizes the automakers’ profits. The action does nothing to actually bring down electric vehicle costs to make them more accessible.\n\n\n\nSame story with the IRA’s $64 billion of taxpayer funds to extend the expanded ObamaCare subsidies. History demonstrates that health insurers will use these funds to increase premiums further. Indeed, some health insurers already have announced they are increasing ObamaCare premiums by around 20 percent next year. These subsidies won’t address the underlying reasons for the health care and coverage cost crisis but instead will exacerbate it by facilitating health insurers to charge even more.\n\n\n\nThe only way to fix American society’s biggest problems — including declining real earnings and college and health care unaffordability — is through economic, not political, solutions. That means the government should do less, not more, and empower the free market to work.\n\n\n\nFor example, to meaningfully address outrageous college costs, the government should reduce its presence in the student loan market. This would force colleges to lower costs and improve quality to attract students. Colleges would redirect the costs of worthless degree programs, administrative bloat, five-star amenities, and part of their $691 billion collective endowment to reduce tuition and make college more affordable.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Biden’s plan to throw more money at this problem by bailing out student loans will only make it worse. It treats laborers around the country who chose hard jobs over fancy degrees as chumps on Labor Day.\n\n\n\nAlfredo Ortiz is president and CEO of Job Creators Network.&nbsp;",

Imported from Malaysia, he continues, the instrument’s pulsing electronics laid the foundations for the sound of his band Bleachers’ debut album, 2014’s Strange Desire: “A little bit John Hughes-y, a little bit fucked up,” as Antonoff describes it. As if to prove his point, the band then launch into Rollercoaster, their homage to 80s teen flicks and lusty adolescent hormones.Much like a protagonist from one of Hughes’s films, Bleachers remains something of an underdog. While Antonoff is one of pop’s most in-demand songwriters and producers, working with the likes of Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey and Lorde, his band hasn’t quite scaled the commercial or critical heights of his collaborative efforts. As evidenced by the enthusiasm of tonight’s crowd, however, it hasn’t prevented them from cultivating a deeply passionate following. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Happy birthday, Tyler Colvin. | Scott Strazzante/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images\n    \n\n  A thrice-weekly digest, replete with #Cubs, #MLB, and #MiLB factoids, gathered from reputable sources. The Cubs play at Comiskey, and other stories. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Bleed Cubbie Blue is pleased to present a light-hearted, Cubs-centric look at baseball’s colorful past, with plenty of the lore and various narratives to follow as they unfold over the course of time. Here’s a handy Cubs timeline, to help you follow along. We also include Cubs’ player birthdays and a bit of world history, for context.\nToday in baseball history:\n\n\n1918 -  At Comiskey Park, Babe Ruth of the Red Sox six-hits the Cubs in the opening game of the World Series, 1-0. The Fall Classic game, which starts almost a month earlier than usual due to World War I, is played at the White Sox home field rather than Weeghman Park (to be renamed Wrigley Field in 1926) due to the larger seating capacity. During the 7th-inning stretch, a military band plays “The Star Spangled Banner” and Fred Thomas, on leave from the Navy, snaps to attention. (1,2)\n\n1931 - In Cincinnati, the Cubs lose, 4-3, in 10 innings. Hack Wilson, in the Cubs doghouse for drinking and not hitting, is left in the bullpen to warm up pitchers when manager Rogers Hornsby, short of outfielders, inserts pitcher Bud Teachout in LF. On the train back to Chicago that night, Wilson starts arguing with two writers. When Pat Malone wanders by, he joins in the argument and, with his encouragement, Wilson punches out both writers. Malone will be fined $500 for his actions while club president Bill L. Veeck will suspend Wilson without pay for the rest of the season. In 112 games, Wilson hit just .261 with 13 home runs, and the Cubs will send the slumping slugger to St. Louis over the winter. (2)\n\n1962 - Ken Hubbs of the Cubs sets major league records at 2B for consecutive games without an error (78) and consecutive chances accepted (418) without an error. His streak ends with a 4th-inning throwing error as Cincinnati beats Chicago, 4-1. (2)\n\n1964 - Ernie Banks belts a double and homer in the same inning, and the Cubs use the big score to beat the Cards, 8-5. Mike Cuellar takes the loss against Larry Jackson. (2)\n\n1969 - Billy Williams has all four of Chicago’s hits, as the Cubs lose a 9-2 decision to Steve Blass and the Pirates. There’s nothing cheap about Billy’s hits - two doubles and two homers - as he sets a National League record for most hits in a game with no other hits, tying the major-league record of Kid Elberfeld (August 1, 1903). Blass helps his own cause with his only major league homer, a three-run blast, off Ken Holtzman, and three singles. The win is Pittsburgh’s first at Wrigley Field since July 5, 1968, a string of 13 losses. They’ll win the next two to sweep the series and drop the Cubs lead to 2½ games. (2)\n\n1978 - The Expos beat the Cubs, 10-8, in a nine-inning game that sees a major-league record 45 players participate. (2)\n\nCubs birthdays: Ed Stein, Lefty Leifield, Candy Maldonado, Cliff Bartosh, Jeff Stevens, Tyler Colvin*. Also notable: Nap Lajoie HOF, Bill Mazeroski HOF.\nToday in world history:\n\n\n1666 - Great Fire of London ends, leaving 13,200 houses destroyed and 8 dead.\n\n1698 - Russian Tsar Peter the Great imposes a tax on beards.\n\n1882 - 10,000 workers march in 1st Labor Day parade in NYC.\n\n1901 - National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, better known as Minor League Baseball is formed at the Leland Hotel in Chicago.\n\n1955 - WTTW TV channel 11 in Chicago, IL (PBS) begins broadcasting.\n\n1966 Jerry Lewis’ 1st Muscular Dystrophy Labor Day telethon raises $1 million. \n\nCommon sources:\n\n(1) — Today in Baseball History.\n(2) — Baseball Reference.\n\n(3) — Society for American Baseball Research.\n(4) — Baseball Hall of Fame.\n(5) — This Day in Chicago Cubs history.\n\nFor world history.\n\n*pictured.\nThere is a very active baseball history community and there are many facets to their views. We strive for clarity. Please be aware that we are trying to make the historical record as represented by our main sources coherent and as accurate as is possible. No item is posted here without corroboration. Some of these items spread from site to site without being verified. That is exactly why we ask for reputable sources, so that we can address them to the originators.\nAlso please remember that this is supposed to be fun.",

        "description": "Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Not a good weekend for the Buccos.  The Pittsburgh Pirates got swept by the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday, falling 4-3 in the final match of the series.\nThe Bucs fell behind early in a 3-0 hole, with JT Brubaker giving up single runs in the second, third, and fourth innings. Despite this, he wasn’t awful, finishing with a line of five and a third innings pitched, giving up three runs, two of them earned, on five hits to go along with two walks and five strikeouts. \nThe Bucs would battle back to tie it on a two-run double by Josh VanMeter in the fourth and then a solo shot by Oneil Cruz, his 12th dinger of the year, in the fifth inning to leave Brubaker with the no decision.\n\n\n115.8 MPH!The ball JUMPS off Oneil Cruz's bat! pic.twitter.com/Q1wt7nFdkM— MLB (@MLB) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nBut the Jays would take back the lead in the seventh when Teoscer Hernandez hit an RBI single off of Duane Underwood Jr., who was pretty bad in this series. He finished with one inning pitched, giving up the single run off of four hits to take the loss and fall to 1-5 on the season. \nThe Bucs would threaten in the ninth after Jack Suwinski got things started with a no-out single. Cal Mitchell would then single, sending Suwinski to third. Greg Allen came in to pinch run for Mitchell and then stole second base, leaving runners at second and third with nobody out. \nBut Josh VanMeter, Tucapita Marcano, and Kevin Newman would all strike out swinging to end the threat, end the inning, and solidify the sweep for Toronto. \nThe Bucs are now 49-84, and as they stumble and bumble down the stretch, you have to wonder if 60 wins is even a possibility. \nThey’ll be back in action this afternoon with an early game kicking off a series against the New York Mets.",

        "description": "David Dermer-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Today’s Marlins news roundup also includes a check-in on the tank race for 2023 MLB Draft position. Marlins Game Coverage\n\n\n\n\n\nMarlins Podcast Episodes\n\n\n\nSunday’s minor league scores: Triple-A Jacksonville and Double-A Pensacola were rained out; High-A Beloit won, 6-1; Low-A Jupiter lost, 8-3. Zach Zubia (Beloit) drew two more walks. His single-season walk total is fifth-highest in Marlins minor league history. In their first full year at ABC Supply Stadium, the Sky Carp set a record for home attendance. Kahlil Watson (Jupiter) recorded the first four-hit game of his career and has strung together an 11-game on-base streak since returning from the injured list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Marlins’ seven-game losing streak is their longest of the season. They are seventh in the MLB reverse standings, but only up one in the loss column over the Reds for fifth-worst record.\nThe Braves won their season series over the Marlins for the eighth straight year, and for the fifth straight year, they’re guaranteed to finish ahead of Miami in the standings.\nRevisiting our predictions for the series, nobody nailed the outcome perfectly, but most of us had the reigning world champs finishing on top and Max Fried’s five hitless innings were enough to earn him Series MVP honors.\nThe Marlins, Braves, Phillies, Cubs, Reds and Athletics are the only MLB teams not in action on Labor Day.\nJordan McPherson of the Miami Herald details why strength of schedule should be considered when assessing Sandy Alcantara’s place in the National League Cy Young award race. \n\nGarrett Cooper’s horrific slump rages on. He’s on the short list of coldest hitters in baseball over the last two months, coinciding with his selection as a MLB All-Star.\nKevin Barral hosted a Twitter Space covering the progress of Marlins rookie hitters and managerial candidates that the club should consider for 2023. \nJosé Salas and Victor Mesa Jr. are expected to participate in the Arizona Fall League, Alex Carver of Fish On The Farm reports. Assuming the league’s setup hasn’t changed from 2021, the Marlins will be able to send a delegation of up to eight prospects.\n\nAlbert Pujols clobbered his 695th career home run. Pujols’ next one will tie him with Alex Rodriguez for fourth place on the MLB all-time list.\n\nZac Gallen extended his scoreless innings streak to 41 1⁄3 innings. The MLB record is 59, set by Orel Hershiser in 1988.\nHighly touted infield prospect Oswald Peraza, who the Marlins reportedly coveted in trade talks with the Yankees, has gotten his first crack at the majors. So far, he’s 0-for-7 with three strikeouts and a hit by pitch.\nJoe Frisaro has found a new home for his Man On 2nd podcast with the Coach and Kernan podcast network. Frisaro was previously partnered with the Five Reasons Sports Network.\nWith football season now underway, get all your Miami Dolphins coverage from The Phinsider and your Miami Hurricanes coverage from State of the U!",

        "description": "Hillary Clinton told CBS News she began wearing pantsuits after photographers shot “suggestive” photos of her during a trip to Brazil.\n\n\n\n“I was sitting on a couch and the press was let in, there were a bunch of them shooting up,” Clinton told CBS News’s Norah O’Donnell.\n\n\n\n“All of a sudden, the White House gets alerted to these billboards that show me sitting down with — I thought my legs [were] together, but the way it’s shot, it’s sort of suggestive,” Clinton added.\n\n\n\nThe photos were used to sell lingerie. Clinton said the incident and the constant photography of her led her to switch to pantsuits, which have become a staple of the ex-first lady’s fashion.\n\n\n\nThe former Secretary of State and her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, sat down with O’Donnell to promote the pair’s forthcoming Apple TV+ docuseries, “Gutsy.”\n\n\n\n“I didn’t know that story,” Chelsea Clinton said. “I didn’t know that story, it’s by far and away the greatest revelation I had.”\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton said the incident in Brazil was the first of many unflattering experiences she had with press photographers as she increasingly became a public figure.\n\n\n\n“I also began to have the experience of having photographers all the time,” she told O’Donnell. “I'd be on a stage, I'd be climbing stairs, and they’d be below me. I just couldn't deal with it.”\n\n\n\nClinton also said during the interview she has “no regrets” about choosing to stay in her marriage to former President Bill Clinton, calling it the gutsiest decision of her private life.\n\n\n\nChelsea Clinton told O’Donnell the goal of the mother-daughter duo’s new series is to provide inspiring stories about women to viewers.\n\n\n\n“People hopefully can see part of their own life, whether their own struggles, their own opportunities, in the women's stories that we’re sharing, so that they hopefully can be a little bit closer to feeling ‘well I can be gutsy, too,’” she said.\n\n\n\nMore of the interview with the two Clintons is poised to air on Tuesday on “CBS Evening News” and O’Donnell’s new streaming show, “Person to Person.”",

        "description": "O2 Brixton Academy, LondonWorn down by the music industry, Taylor is retiring at 31 – but her athletic London goodbye is less a reason to commiserate than to celebrate an R&amp;B trailblazerAt 31, Teyana Taylor is one of pop’s youngest retirees. In late 2020, the Harlem-born singer and dancer announced that she was stepping back from the music industry, worn down by nearly 15 years of feeling undervalued by her record labels – first Pharrell’s Interscope imprint Star Trak, and later Kanye West’s record label Good Music. Two years later, Taylor is finally bringing her farewell tour – The Last Rose Petal 2 – to London. For the sold-out audience packed into Brixton Academy on Sunday night, it’s less a reason to commiserate than an opportunity to celebrate an artist who, in spite of everything, has still managed to release two of the best R&amp;B albums in recent memory – the West-produced KTSE from 2018 and 2020’s The Album.The Last Rose Petal is a noticeably higher-budget show than Taylor’s previous tours, but the new bells and whistles – a neon sign, large screens, multiple costume changes – can’t help but feel superfluous, simply because Taylor herself is a true marvel of a performer. She is not a singer who has been trained to dance, but an accomplished dancer who also happens to wield a gorgeous, pathos-drenched rasp of a voice. (Watch West’s video for Fade for an example of Taylor’s remarkable athletic prowess.) Watching her jump, pop and bound across the stage without missing a note – as during Rose in Harlem, the show’s blistering, anarchic finale – is genuinely jaw-dropping. Continue reading...",

She also must repair a party deeply divided after Mr. Johnson’s turbulent three-year tenure, which peaked in 2019 with a landslide general election victory but descended into unrelenting scandals after that.”",

        "description": "“For two decades, midterm elections have served as a vehicle for voter discontent, a chance for Americans to punish the president, shake up a statehouse and express their anger with the party in power by costing them congressional seats and governor’s mansions,” the New York Times reports,\n\n\n\n“This year, though, the dissatisfaction has intensified and become something like a national anxiety disorder.”\n\n\n\n“With the pandemic receding, voters have been whipsawed by economic uncertainty, public safety concerns, lingering public health threats and shortages of everything from used cars to baby formula to teachers. The political upheaval around abortion rights, devastating gun violence, the F.B.I. investigation into former President Donald J. Trump and his continued lies about the 2020 election have heightened the sense that the country’s political system is deeply dysfunctional, if not headed toward collapse.”\n\n\n\n“Now, as the midterm contests enter the final campaign stretch after Labor Day, the election is shaping up to be a referendum on which party is more to blame for a country that has decidedly not returned to normal.”",

        "description": "From subatomic particles to human beings, interaction is what shapes realityQuantum theory is perhaps the most successful scientific idea ever. So far, it has never been proved wrong. It is stupendously predictive, it has clarified the structure of the periodic table, the functioning of the sun, the colour of the sky, the nature of chemical bonds, the formation of galaxies and much more. The technologies we have been able to build as a result range from computers to lasers to medical instruments.Yet, a century after its birth, something remains deeply puzzling about quantum theory. Unlike its illustrious predecessor, Newton’s classical mechanics, it does not tell us how physical systems behave. Instead, it confines itself to predicting the probability that a physical system will affect us in one way or another. When an electron is fired from one side of a wall with two holes, for instance, quantum theory tells us where it will end up on the other side, stubbornly saying nothing plausible about which hole it has gone through. It treats any physical system as a black box: if you do this to it now, it will react like that later. What happens in between? The theory simply doesn’t tell us. Continue reading...",

Are we ready to see disability without symbolism?Ten years ago, in early September 2012, a team of archaeologists and researchers unearthed the 527-year-old remains of Richard III in the lost site of the former Greyfriars church, beneath the staff car park of Leicester city council social services.Before the results of mitochondrial DNA analysis of a descendant of Anne of York, Richard III’s sister, confirmed that the remains belonged to the fallen king, it was the osteology work of Dr Jo Appleby that led to a probable identification. She determined that the skeleton in the car park belonged to a man between the ages of 30 and 34, whose spine had a pronounced curvature, and whose head showed signs of two lethal injuries consistent with battle trauma.

        "description": "OpenAI has added a new “outpointing” function to its text-to-image AI model DALL-E that lets the system generate new visuals that expand the borders of any given picture. \nIn the example above, you can see how DALL-E, with the help of human prompting, “imagines” what’s outside the frame of Johannes Vermeer’s portrait “Girl with a Pearl Earring.” Note, how, even from the limited information provided by the portrait, the system is able to match Vermeer’s style, mimicking the shadows and highlights of the original. \nIn the timelapse below, you can also see how the artist responsible, August Kamp, had to expand the image in small sections at a time, often redoing DALL-E’s generations in order to get the outcome she wanted.

        "description": "César Prieto, who hit a three-run homer on Sunday. | Set Number: X164080 TK1\n    \n\n  Chris Vallimont threw five scoreless and Norfolk’s bullpen was perfect. Bowie lost a heartbreaker, and Delmarva’s Max Wagner hit his first professional home run. Triple-A: Norfolk Tides 10, Lehigh Valley IronPigs (Phillies) 0\nWhatever the opposite of a nailbiter is, that was this game. Norfolk scored four runs in the second inning, one in the sixth and five in the seventh. They did it without a home run but put up a solid 11 hits and eight walks. \nTides hitters spread the love, as well as the RBIs. Jordan Westburg (1-for-4, BB) hit a two-run single ahead of a two-run triple by Joey Ortiz (1-for-3, 2 BB). Ramon Rodriguez hit a pair of RBI singles and had himself a 3-for-4 day. Robert Neustrom (3-for-5) and Cadyn Grenier both hit two-run doubles. Colton Cowser didn’t have a hit, but he got on base twice with a walk and a HBP. \nChris Vallimont, a waiver pickup in May, had one of his best outings of the year, allowing no runs and just five hits over five innings. \nAfter Vallimont, a combined cast of Louis Head, Morgan McSweeney, Logan Gillaspie and Cole Uvila threw four scoreless and hitless innings. The only baserunners they allowed were two scattered walks. \nThat’s a pretty convincing win.\nBox Score\nDouble-A: Erie SeaWolves (Tigers) 5, Bowie Baysox 4\nBowie lost a hard-fought seesaw contest that featured four lead changes, two hit Baysox, lots of bad blood, umpiring shenanigans, and Baysox manager Kyle Moore getting ejected. \nBrenan Hanifee threw four scoreless and struck out three, but Erie scored three against Easton Lucas in the fifth inning to go up 3-0. Bowie valiantly tied up the game on a three-run César Prieto bomb, but Erie went ahead again with a run off Tyler Burch. A fired up Coby Mayo tied up the game with a home run in the top of the ninth, shouting what were probably expletives at the Erie bench as he crossed home plate. It was too bad that Hector Pérez gave up a run in the ninth and got saddled with the loss. \nBowie only totaled five hits, but they made them count. Hudson Haskin, Andrew Daschbach and Prieto, author of the three-run home run, had a hit apiece. Coby Mayo had a two-hit game for the second day in a row. Connor Norby exited Saturday’s game early and sat out Sunday’s game. \nBox Score\nHigh-A: Aberdeen IronBirds 4, Hickory Crawdads (Rangers) 2\nA fine day for Aberdeen pitching, as Daniel Lloyd (3.12 ERA, 79 K in 69 IP) and Jake Lyons (3.92 ERA, 47 K in 43 IP) combined for eight one-run innings and eleven strikeouts. Kade Strowd (0.64 ERA, 22 K in 16 IP) picked up the save. \nAll four of Aberdeen’s runs came off the bat of Connor Pavolony. The 2021 seventh-rounder homered in the first, driving in three runs with one swing. Then in the fifth inning, he drove in Donta’ Williams with a sac fly. Williams doubled and went 2-for-4. TT Bowens went 1-for-3 and walked. Frederick Bencosme went 1-for-3 and walked. Heston Kjerstad doubled in four trips to the plate.\nBox Score\nLow-A: Fredericksburg Nationals 10, Delmarva Shorebirds 2\nIt was a bad day for a bunch of Delmarva pitchers, but the good news is you probably haven’t heard of (or at least, much about) any of them: Keagan Gillies (2021 15th-round pick), Cameron Weston (2022 8th-round pick), Reese Sharp (2022 20th-round pick), Edgar Portes (2019 minor league free agent signing), Ryan Hennen (signed off waivers in August), Alejandro Mendez (2019 minor league free agent signing). Together this sextet allowed ten runs, eleven hits and six walks. \nThe good news is, most of the Shorebirds prospects you HAVE heard of are position players, and some of them are excelling: Max Wagner hit his first pro home run and Dylan Beavers (1-for-4) is OPS’ing .999 right now. Two other 2022 draftees, ninth-rounder Adam Crampton and fourteenth-rounder Adam Retzbach had three hits and three walks between them.\nBox Score\nThere are no scheduled games on Monday.",

She also must repair a party deeply divided after Mr. Johnson’s turbulent three-year tenure, which peaked in 2019 with a landslide general election victory but descended into unrelenting scandals after that.”",

The political upheaval around abortion rights, devastating gun violence, the F.B.I. investigation into former President Donald J. Trump and his continued lies about the 2020 election have heightened the sense that the country’s political system is deeply dysfunctional, if not headed toward collapse.”\n\n\n\n“Now, as the midterm contests enter the final campaign stretch after Labor Day, the election is shaping up to be a referendum on which party is more to blame for a country that has decidedly not returned to normal.”",

        "description": "Young Arthur – bullied at school and struggling with his dad Johnny Vegas – seeks sanctuary at his local poolSheffield-based YouTuber Luke Cutforth here ventures into – that dread phrase – long-form content, with a thin slip of YA fantasy (drawn from a novel by Caroline Smailes) about a humiliated schoolboy retrieved from the brink of self-sacrifice. Cutforth clearly knows his way around a camera, which isn’t always the case at the industry’s lower-budget end; with cinematographer Josh Winslade, he makes atmospheric use of his primary location, Manchester’s Victoria Baths, recast as an abandoned spa. Yet the pacing proves sluggish, and the adaptation broadly unpersuasive: a fifth-former’s creative writing assignment, with clunky exposition and potential elements of autobiography that elicit sporadic cringes.Cutforth has engineered one noteworthy casting coup. We know young Arthur (James Tarpey) has it bad because he’s being raised by Johnny Vegas, welded into a La-Z-Boy and essentially reviving the character Vegas was before multiple caravanning misadventures repositioned him as a national treasure. The director’s relative youth (he was 21 while filming) means we should probably defer to his insight on the ways of school corridors: snickering cruelties paused for Cats auditions, teachers pushing packed lunches at those left behind. Yet the film’s heart is in the sanctuary Arthur finds at the pool, populated by a sprightly selkie (Rebecca Hanssen) with an insatiable curiosity about human life. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photo by Keith Birmingham/MediaNews Group/Pasadena Star-News via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Some Dodgers links on Labor Day for your perusal:\nTyler Kepner at the New York Times wrote about how everyday stars Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, and Trea Turner have stabilized the majors’ best offense, including this quote from Freeman: “You can be a five-tool player, but if you don’t have the sixth tool of playing every day, what’s the point of the first five tools?”\nDiego Cartaya talked with David Laurila at FanGraphs about how his swing has flattened since turning pro, and about saying goodbye to friend and teammate Alex DeJesus, the shortstop who was traded along with Mitch White to Toronto at the trade deadline.\n\n\nThe second annual Justin Turner Foundation Turner Trot 5K kicked off at Dodger Stadium this morning! More than 1,200 runners participated to help raise funds and awareness for the Dream Center. pic.twitter.com/kcdKKbk51x— Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nJustin Turner and wife Kourtney held the Turner Trot on Sunday, a run/walk that started at Dodger Stadium to raise money for the Justin Turner Foundation. Cary Osborne at Dodgers Insider has more.\nJen Pawol, an umpire in Double-A, is one of only nine women to have umpired in the minors. MLB is long overdue for a woman umpire, Chelsea Janes writes in the Washington Post in her excellent Pawol profile (behind the pawol). \nD-backs right-hander Zac Gallen pitched seven scoreless innings on Sunday, extending his streak to 41⅓ consecutive scoreless innings, the eighth-longest scoreless streak in the live ball era, and at least within shouting distance of Orel Hershiser’s record of 59 straight. Galen is one of only four pitchers in the modern era with six straight scoreless starts of at least six innings, along with three Dodgers — Hershiser, Don Drysdale, and Zack Greinke.\nI was a guest on the latest Infinite Inning podcast with Steven Goldman, talking all things Dodgers and trying to figure out how they have managed to win so much recently.\nThis was a nice gesture before Sunday’s game to honor Jaime Jarrín, who is retiring after the season and has one month remaining in his incredible, 64-year Hall of Fame career:\n\n\nHonor and pleasure to be asked by the 4 umpires to pose with them at home plate knowingly that this is my last season broadcasting Dodger games. Thanks Alfonso Marquez, Lance Barrett, Ramon de Jesus  and Dan Merzer. pic.twitter.com/BmWbYNbLeN— Jaime Jarrín (@JaimeJarrin) September 5, 2022",

        "description": "Photo by Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Colorado Rockies news and links for Monday, September 5, 2022 Coors Field inflates offensive stats. Coors Field deflates pitching stats. If you’ve come this far then likely already you know that. It’s also been discussed and shown multiple times how Coors also hurts outfield defensive metrics. So, the law of averages would suggest that it may help the defensive metrics of infielders. Specifically, let’s take a look at defensive runs saved (DRS).\nLast year, Ryan McMahon led the entire league in DRS with 22 runs saved over 1200-plus innings. Josh Fuentes had an even better rate, saving 11 runs in just under 600 innings. Trevor Story ranks highly on the list also. All of these players are impeccable fielders - the eye test alone can tell you that - but there appears to be a pattern with Coors Field infielders and advanced defensive metrics.\nSince 2003 (the first year DRS numbers are available), Rockies second basemen, third basemen, and shortstops have racked up 151, 102, and 152 defensive runs saved, respectively - good for first, second, and second across the league in that time by position. Considering the infield as a whole, the Rockies have led all of the Majors more than their fair share in the last twenty years.\n\nRemoving the first baseman numbers from the data, the Rockies have led the majors eight separate years and finished in the top three fifteen total times.\n\n(What happened in 2012? Chris Nelson alone accounted for -22 DRS. Josh Rutledge and Marco Scutaro weren’t much help either, leading to the worst Rockies defensive infield we’ve seen.)\nOverall, Rockies infielders have racked up 419 DRS since 2003, almost 100 more than second place on the list. Sure - the Rockies have had good fielders during this time. Troy Tulowitzki, DJ LeMahieu, Nolan Arenado, and Todd Helton aren’t just Gold Glovers, but also regarded as some of the best defenders of their era. But the year after year consistency seems to suggest that something else. LeMahieu’s advanced stats seem to agree.\n\nHow much of LeMahieu’s post Coors Field dropoff can be attributed to his age, and how much can be attributed to a stat that doesn’t necessarily account for Coors isn’t immediately clear. As a second baseman entering his age 31 season, LeMahieu’s dropoff is likely partially attributed to his age, but as he had a career best year on the offensive side of the ball that year, his body appears to be doing fine.\nThis all comes with the mandatory caveat that surrounds most advanced defensive metrics. These stats can vary widely over short time frames and for individuals it is often recommended that you view them in at least three year increments. However, that only makes the Rockies consistency at or near the top of the league more suspicious - typically a stat like DRS would have some fluctuations on a year to year basis.\nCaveats aside, something here doesn’t appear to pass the smell test. Do the Rockies really have the best defensive infield in the majors by a significant margin? Or is this just another product of Coors Field?\n★ ★ ★\nA look at Michael Toglia’s first week in the majors | Rox Pile\nWatching games recently, we’ve got a glimpse at the Rockies of tomorrow. Rox Pile’s Noah Yingling takes a look at Michael Toglia, the Rockies first round pick in 2019 who has been getting starts over the last week. Toglia has hit well in his recent call up, tallying six hits (four for extra bases) in 21 at bats. He was the no. 11 PuRP in the mid-season edition of the rankings and had a combined OPS of .852 between Double and Triple-A before his callup.\n★ ★ ★\nOn the Farm\nTriple-A: Albuquerque Isotopes 7, Sugar Land Space Cowboys 6\nDespite leaving 24 men on base, the ‘topes pulled out the win on Sunday against Sugar Land (HOU). Wynton Bernard reached base four times and came around to score twice. Sam Hilliard did the same and also added a couple of RBIs. Albuquerque pitching gave us three home runs but were able to hold on to get the win. The team has Labor Day off, but then will return to action tomorrow against the El Paso Chihuahuas (SDP).\nDouble-A: Hartford Yard Goats 4, Reading Fightin Phils 2 \nA big seventh inning was all Hartford needed against Reading (PHI) yesterday. A Julio Carreras double brought home Zac Veen and Tyler Hill, then Hunter Stovall brought home Carreras with a hit of his own. Will Gaddis earned the win by pitching two scoreless innings of relief, and Stephen Jones got his seventh save of the year after a spotless ninth. Hartford will continue their homestand next in welcoming the Yankees affiliate, the Somerset Patriots, to town.\nHigh-A: Spokane Indians 4, Vancouver Canadians 3\nIn their home regular season finale, the Indians used a big fourth inning and took advantage of four Canadians errors to send the home faithful away happy. The bottom of the lineup supplied the offense in the rally, with Bladimir Restituyo and Mateo Gil hitting back to back jacks, then Trevor Boone and Cristopher Navarro coming around to score on an Eddy Diaz double. The Indians will go on the road for their final regular season series of the year, taking on Eastern Washington rival Tri-City Dust Devils (LAA) starting Tuesday.\nSingle-A: Modesto Nuts 12, Fresno Grizzlies 0 \nThe Grizzlies also welcomed their fans to a regular season home finale Sunday, but the result was not as sweet. Fresno had just three hits and committed three errors, thoroughly losing the game to former Rockies affiliates Modesto (SEA).  Their final regular season series also starts tomorrow, against the San Jose Giants (SFG).\n★ ★ ★\nPlease keep in mind our Purple Row Community Guidelines when you’re commenting. Thanks!",

        "description": "Everyone had to see this. It was early 2007 when Sadia Harper called her YouTube co-workers to her desk to watch. On her screen, a preteen with a buzz cut and an oversize dress shirt was belting out an Alicia Keys song. “This kid is amazing,” Harper said. The singer’s mother had been badgering her with emails to feature her son, Justin Bieber, on YouTube’s homepage.Harper was one of YouTube’s “coolhunters,” a team once tasked with curating videos on YouTube.com. Today, YouTube is known for its powerful recommendation algorithm: a system criticized for driving people to radical beliefs, conspiracies, and online echo chambers. (YouTube and its parent company, Google, declined to comment for this story.) But in the site’s early days, the service took a different approach to recommending footage.When YouTube was founded in 2005, people often arrived at its videos from a link sent by a friend or found in a Google search. A fair number also came in through its homepage, which company engineers populated by slotting in popular or amusing videos between coding sessions. But wider exposure and new business deals demanded a better approach. By the summer of 2006, YouTube had already become a mass-media must-see, with more than 100 million daily views. Verizon Wireless, which agreed to put a limited version of YouTube on its mobile phones later that year, wanted a more finely curated selection of clips. Apple, which was preparing to debut a new gadget, the iPhone, was interested in something similar, according to multiple people at YouTube involved in discussions.So YouTube hired an editor. Mia Quagliarello, who had been a manager at iTunes, joined the company to program YouTube’s homepage and packages for partners such as Verizon. Flush with Google cash—the internet giant had just acquired the start-up for $1.65 billion—Quagliarello recruited a small team of staffers to keep close tabs on YouTube’s sprawling culture. She started with Joseph Smith, a graveyard-shift screener at YouTube whom everyone called “Big Joe,” who was remarkably adept at spotting budding viral hits before they exploded in popularity. Harper, a high-school friend of one of YouTube’s founders, Steve Chen, joined shortly after. In the months that followed, Quagliarello brought in a journalist, a radio DJ, and actual YouTubers as editors to sift through content on sports, comedy, politics, and other fields, finding gems that viewers might love. Officially, these team members were called “community managers.” But a colleague devised a more resonant title for the team: the coolhunters.YouTube wasn’t yet a commercial hit. The company started sharing advertising sales with popular YouTubers in 2007, but the funds were sparse. Influencers as we know them now didn’t exist. No one used the term creators. Instead, YouTube was overflowing with aspiring comics, filmmakers, musicians, hobbyists, and enthusiasts in every niche imaginable, searching for an audience or just tinkering with a new canvas. (Briefly, in 2006, one of the most popular YouTubers was Peter Oakley, a well-dressed British retiree who went by geriatric1927 and would reminisce about his life.) Quagliarello encouraged her team to make videos introducing themselves. Harper shot hers in her bedroom and also posted clips of DIY crafting, another emerging YouTube subculture. She asked viewers to send videos to her email address, which is what Bieber’s mother kept doing. Harper had to politely tell her that YouTube preferred to feature original songs, not covers. Still, even when the coolhunters passed on a technicality, YouTube minted stars—a year later, a record executive would find Bieber’s videos on YouTube and make him a pop sensation.[Read: Raised by YouTube]The coolhunters each had their own way of finding hits. Every morning, Harper scoured a list she’d assembled of blogs and internet arcana, searching for interesting videos. When she found ones worth putting on the homepage, she would add them to YouTube’s “Featured Videos” banner, which stacked small frames of videos in a column of 10. Her team swapped these slots every four hours, giving YouTubers behind the videos they selected a guaranteed cascade of views. Before Donald Glover was a celebrity, Harper promoted a comedy sketch in which he mocks an old hip-hop pose, the “B-Boy Stance.” Some picks showed up in wider pop culture. Harper discovered a music video with a catchy, whistling hook from a band called Peter Bjorn and John. A week later, Drew Barrymore wore the band’s T-shirt on Saturday Night Live.YouTube’s coolhunters were tastemakers, and they were among the first at the company to actually reach out to the delightful weirdos populating its site. Michele Flannery, a former local-radio director who curated YouTube’s music videos, told me she liked to prowl for unconventional artists, such as quirky ukulele players and indie rockers. “Make it really personal and intimate,” she advised musicians posting on YouTube who wanted to be featured on the homepage, “like you’re sitting in your bedroom.” The coolhunters latched onto this aesthetic and experimented themselves. They invited the filmmaker Rob Zombie, and later Wes Craven, to guest edit for Halloween. Steve Grove, the news and politics manager, arranged to have YouTubers submit video questions that would run during televised presidential debates. In 2007, a bizarre, poetic homemade music video, “Chocolate Rain,” blew up on YouTube, and dozens of people uploaded covers; today the video has more than 133 million views. As a lark, the community managers planned their first “takeover,” filling the entire YouTube homepage with tributes to the song. An engineer rushed over in panic, assuming that YouTube had been hacked. The coolhunters would repeat the gimmick and Rickroll everyone visiting YouTube.During YouTube’s first couple of years at Google, the parent company largely left it alone. Google lawyers helped YouTube fight legal battles, and Google’s balance sheet funded YouTube’s blitzkrieg expansion into new countries around the world. But YouTube was mostly independent.Eventually, though, Google’s sensibilities started to trickle in. “The Google way of solving problems is to throw machines at them, not people,” recalls Andy Stack, a former YouTube manager. Sadia Harper encountered this first with cars. A few years into coolhunting, she began curating automotive videos as the coolhunters added new categories to cover the site’s expanse. She liked cars. People liked watching them on YouTube—car races, Humvees climbing walls, detailed tutorials on engines. Periodically, Harper would slot interesting footage onto YouTube’s homepage. One day, she told me, a programmer approached her desk and explained that engineers had developed an algorithm for picking homepage videos designed to get optimal clicks. They wanted to test it on a trial category. They picked cars.The coder loaded a sample page of videos that the algorithm had selected. Enter. Refresh. The reloaded page filled with “revving” videos—footage shot inside luxury vehicles where cameras lingered on the foot or lower half of the driver, usually a woman in heels, pumping the accelerator. Often, leather was involved. Harper had seen those sorts of videos and intentionally ignored them. “That’s a fetish,” she protested. “That’s not what we’re about.”YouTube wasn’t new to algorithmic sorting, but its first iterations were fairly primitive. When someone clicked on a video, the page’s right flank—its “related videos” section—filled with clips that other viewers who clicked on that same video had watched. The algorithm was accounting for “co-visitation”: People who like this also like that. Erik Klein, an early YouTube engineer, recalls the limits of this approach with huge viral hits that everyone co-visited; viewers, staff joked, were always two videos away from seeing Justin Bieber. Algorithm experiments could go awry, sometimes showing too much of the internet’s dark mirror. Before Google’s acquisition, YouTube programmers once tweaked their system and saw video clicks shoot up, only to discover that “every three or four videos, you would end up with a cat video or someone in a bikini,” remembers Jasson Schrock, a former YouTube designer.Programmers went back to the drawing board, adding more filters for decency into the code. Google brought more computing horsepower and coding proficiency, letting YouTube measure granular signals such as how long people lingered on videos, what time of day they watched, and from where. YouTube’s algorithms improved. At first, they couldn’t detect a butt from a peach and left that to human moderators, but eventually, YouTube developed skin-detection software to remove obscene stuff automatically. Related videos started clocking more clicks. The formula looked ready for prime time on the homepage.By 2009, YouTube’s business was preparing for prime time too. Google began tightening its belt after the financial crisis, and YouTube, although a cultural phenomenon, was a perpetual money pit. New managers arrived to whip YouTube into profitable shape. The coolhunters looked less and less relevant to YouTube’s commercial future and to Google’s culture. When Lady Gaga’s hit “Telephone” debuted in March of 2010, Google salespeople wanted the music video, a raunchy, slick featurette set in a women’s prison, to premiere as a paid promotion on YouTube. Flannery remembers the coolhunters protesting that similarly raunchy videos from amateur YouTubers would be “age-gated” and prohibited from the homepage. The salespeople and Lady Gaga won. On another occasion, Harper recalled, a YouTube sales leader asked her to feature an advertiser’s video. When Harper declined, citing the material’s so-so quality, the salesman pointed to the assorted clips that coolhunters had curated and asked her, “Is that stuff any better?”[Read: How YouTube’s algorithm really works]According to more than 10 interviews with YouTube staffers familiar with the dynamics, some of the company’s higher-ups had growing misgivings about the coolhunter team. Viacom had sued YouTube over copyright infringement, arguing that YouTube knowingly let pirated copy run rampant. To some, an operation that sifted through videos to feature didn’t help the legal defense that YouTube was a hands-off platform (Google and Viacom eventually settled out of court). And as YouTube launched in more and more countries, replicating a curatorial team for each country felt too costly and time-consuming. “We couldn’t run that fast enough,” recalls Chen, YouTube’s co-founder and early technical chief. Besides, software was cheaper. Some signs indicated that the curated homepage wasn’t driving growth; people went there to search, not to linger or click on clips. A few people at Google thought the coolhunters operated as hidden kingmakers, picking, almost like Hollywood producers or agents, which YouTubers would become stars. And Facebook, then surging in popularity, was attracting users and advertisers based on a social feed of content tailored just so for every individual.But the most damning case against the coolhunters was that they lacked a way to measure themselves. At Google, everything was measured. Harper, who had studied mathematics, put together a data analysis trying to quantify the impact of her team’s virtual town square. It was not enough. Around early 2010, a new YouTube product manager began meeting with the editorial team to discuss ways that the homepage could be more “relevant” to viewers, primarily with more personalized algorithms like Facebook had. Mark Day, YouTube’s comedy editor, had an epiphany during one of these gatherings. Oh, wait a minute, Day thought. Your job is to eliminate my job.Shortly after, in 2010, the coolhunters were disbanded. Most members were reassigned to work in marketing roles helping brand-name companies sell on the site. YouTube’s machines would now pick the videos.YouTube would likely never have become a staple of pop culture without the small, early team that cemented its coolness and nurtured its first viral hits. But at the same time, YouTube may not have become the behemoth it is today if it had kept relying on human curators. In the years since, YouTube has sometimes toyed with handpicking videos, featuring select creators or trends that the company wants to highlight. And YouTube has resorted to curation to manage messes from its scale—putting content from health agencies and news outlets in prominent places during the pandemic and other events prone to conspiracy mongering. Often, these efforts feel drowned out by the platform’s sheer enormity. It’s like “putting a thimble in a gushing geyser,” says Claire Stapleton, a manager hired in 2014 to curate marketing content.Either way, viewers may not notice these attempts: They usually just watch the video that shows up next in their YouTube feed.This article has been adapted from Mark Bergen’s forthcoming book, Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube’s Chaotic Rise to World Domination.",

        "description": "Photo by Brace Hemmelgarn/Minnesota Twins/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Dylan Cease comes one batter away from a no-hitter. Aaron Judge soars as the Yankees sink. And other news from around the league.  Happy Labor Day to all of you and my sympathies to all of you who still had to get up and go to work today. \n\nYou probably already know this, but White Sox pitcher Dylan Cease lost a no-hitter with two outs in the ninth inning on Saturday.\nA list of pitchers who have lost no-hitters with two out in the ninth. It’s not a complete list as it omits Chuck Rainey’s memorable lost no-no. \nJames Fegan writes that even though Cease lost the no-hitter, he’s already made a major transformation into an ace this season. (The Athletic sub. req.)\nMike Axisa has the top ten storylines in MLB as we head into September.\n\nOne of those storylines is Albert Pujols’ quest for 700 home runs before he retires. Matt Snyder looks to see if any other active players who have a shot at finishing their career with over 700 home runs.\n\nJayson Stark looks at Pujols’ terrific month of August and other weird and wacky tidbits from the previous month. (The Athletic sub. req.)\nAnother storyline to watch is Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge’s quest for an American League record 62 home runs. Judge hit number 53 on Sunday and is “on pace” for a 64 home run season.\n\nDespite that, Lindsey Adler looks at how the Yankees season has collapsed in the second half. (The Athletic sub. req.) The Boys from the Bronx still have a five-game lead in the AL East, but back in May and June we were wondering if they’d break the Mariners record for most wins in a season. Now it’s unlikely the Yanks even win 100 games. \n\n\n\nAaron Judge playing like has no choice but to carry the whole ass yankee team across the finish line. My god.— Molly Knight (@molly_knight) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\n\nJay Jaffe looks at how really good the Dodgers are and that despite that, they have a few weaknesses going into October. \nZach Crizer looks at Cardinals first baseman Paul Goldschmidt’s chase of a Triple Crown and  just how amazing his 2022 season has been.\nAndrew Simon looks at the ten best stat races to follow this September. \n\nDiamondbacks ace Zac Gallen tied a major league record with his sixth-straight scoreless start. \n\nOf course, Gallen hasn’t gone more than 7 1⁄3 innings in any of those starts, so his consecutive scoreless innings streak stands at “just” 41 1⁄3 innings, still 17 2⁄3 shy of Orel Hershiser’s record of 59. Andrew Simon has the ten longest scoreless streaks in history.\n\nThomas Harrigan has ten potential free agents this winter who have a lot riding on how they play in September.\n\nBradford Doolittle looks back at all the trades made at the deadline and assesses which ones have paid off for the teams and which ones have been busts? (ESPN+ sub. req.)\nThe Nationals trading Juan Soto to the Padres ranks as one of the biggest midseason trades of all time. But although Washington misses Soto, his replacement on the roster, 30-year-old rookie first baseman Joey Meneses, has actually outperformed Soto since his call-up. Ben Lindbergh gives an introduction to Meneses and says his success is just more proof of baseball’s wild unpredictability. \nGiants ace Carlos Rodón is potentially a free agent this winter, but he may have given a hint that he wants to stay when he said “Giants fans are probably the best fans in the game.” Or he’s just sucking up to the locals.\nTigers outfielder Austin Meadows said he will miss the rest of the season to deal with mental health issues. Meadows will continue to travel with the team, but he won’t be activated off the injured list. Meadows said he went public with this because he wants encourage people who need help to not be afraid to ask for help.\nYankees outfielder Andrew Benintendi will need surgery for a broken hamate bone. It’s not clear yet whether he will miss the rest of the season. \n\nMets ace Max Scherzer took himself out of his start on Saturday after only five innings after feeling “fatigue” in his left side. Scherzer said he intends to make his next start and “Better to be safe than sorry in this scenario.”\n\nOrioles rookie Adley Rutschman is taking the league by storm with a 3.6 WAR in just 84 games. Gabe Lacques has a profile of Rutschman and quotes his manager Brandon Hyde as saying “It’s scary how good he’s going to be.”\n\nRutschman could be a hero in September for the Orioles. Here’s each team’s all-time greatest hero in September. I’ve got no argument with the choice for the Cubs. \nHannah Keyser looks at the influence shortstop Carlos Correa has had on the Twins and how he’s helped to build a winning mentality in the clubhouse.\n\nOf course, I hope that Correa wouldn’t have taught the Twins this:\n\n\n\nthat was TOO close pic.twitter.com/8XNhvEz9tY— Jomboy Media (@JomboyMedia) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\n\nThe Rangers have designated former Cy Young Award winner Dallas Keuchel for assignment after just two starts with the team. \nAnd finally, Paul Lukas has a thoughtful essay on booing at the ballpark and why he just won’t do it anymore.\n\n\nAnd tomorrow will be a better day than today, Buster. All of you who have today off, I hope you have a good time. Me, I’m still working.",

Truss will be the next prime minister of the United Kingdom after winning the race on Monday to lead the United Kingdom’s Conservative Party.\n\n\n\nTruss will take over the role from Boris Johnson, who announced his resignation in July as his relationship with Conservative lawmakers soured over his handling of a number of issues. Truss served as foreign secretary under Johnson.\n\n\n\n“I am honoured to be elected Leader of the Conservative Party,” Truss said after the announcement.\n\n\n\n“Thank you for putting your trust in me to lead and deliver for our great country,” she continued. “I will take bold action to get all of us through these tough times, grow our economy and unleash the United Kingdom’s potential.”\n\n\n\nTruss, who promised to increase defense spending and cut taxes during the campaign, will assume the prime minister role as the country faces skyrocketing energy prices and high inflation.\n\n\n\nShe received 57.4 percent of the vote, beating out rival Rishi Sunak, Britain’s former finance minister, who received 42.6 percent of the vote.\n\n\n\nTruss was largely viewed as the frontrunner during the campaign. Roughly 172,000 dues-paying Conservative Party members cast ballots in the election after the party’s lawmakers nominated eight candidates and narrowed the ballot list to Truss and Sunak.\n\n\n\nQueen Elizabeth II is scheduled to formally appoint Truss as Britain’s prime minister on Tuesday during a ceremony at her Balmoral estate in Scotland.\n\n\n\nIn remarks directly following the announcement, Truss doubled down on her plan to grow Britain’s economy by cutting taxes, also emphasizing her belief in “personal responsibility.”\n\n\n\n“During this leadership campaign, I campaigned as a conservative, and I will govern as a conservative,” she said.\n\n\n\nTruss also vowed to take action on the country’s mounting energy issues, characterizing it as a “crisis.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnnual energy bills for the average U.K. household have&nbsp;already risen&nbsp;by 54 percent this year,&nbsp;and consumers will see another hike in October that brings the gain to roughly 80 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGlobal oil and gas prices jumped as demand surged from countries recovering from the coronavirus pandemic. Supply strains resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have furthered the imbalance of energy supplies and demand, contributing to price gains and fueling fears of a recession.\n\n\n\nBritain’s&nbsp;annual inflation rate hit&nbsp;10.1 percent in July, a 40-year high that outpaces the U.S. and other places in Europe.\n\n\n\n“I will deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people’s energy bills, but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply,” Truss said on Monday.\n\n\n\nThe Conservative Party has maintained a healthy majority since the country’s 2019 elections. Johnson has served atop the party since that year but came under increasing pressure to step aside in recent months over a variety of issues, eventually leading to his resignation announcement in July.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister attended gatherings in his office and other government buildings in 2020 and 2021 when the country imposed pandemic restrictions on parties, leading Johnson to become the first sitting prime minister to receive fines.\n\n\n\nSome in his party later called for Johnson’s resignation over his handling of sexual misconduct allegations against Johnson’s deputy chief whip.\n\n\n\nSunak, Truss’s most formidable opponent in the race, resigned last year amid the scandals, days before Johnson announced he would leave 10 Downing Street.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTruss remained in Johnson’s cabinet and on Monday called him a “friend.”\n\n\n\n“Boris — you got Brexit done, you crushed Jeremy Corbyn, you rolled out the vaccine and you stood up to Vladimir Putin,” she said. “You are admired from Kyiv to Carlisle.”\n\n\n\nKeir Starmer, the leader of U.K.’s Labour Party, congratulated Truss on her victory.\n\n\n\n“But after 12 years of the Tories all we have to show for it is low wages, high prices and a Tory cost of living crisis,” Starmer&nbsp;tweeted. “Only Labour can deliver the fresh start our country needs.”\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8:47 a.m.",

as the bases were getting loaded for a grand slam homerun for the Republican team in the 2022 general election, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) managed to strike out its own team. Instead of taking control of both Houses of Congress, the GOP will likely end the election cycle with roughly 48 senators and a razor-thin margin, either way, in the House.\n\n\n\nSeveral factors will have played a part in this GOP election debacle, but the major factor will be the SCOTUS majority’s decision overturning&nbsp;Roe v. Wade. The court’s Dobbs&nbsp;decision, which took away a 50-year federal right to abortion, has&nbsp;energized women voters&nbsp;across the country.\n\n\n\nPrior to the leak of the&nbsp;Dobbs&nbsp;draft opinion,&nbsp;new voter registrants in 10 selected states&nbsp;were roughly equal between the sexes. Post-Dobbs, female registrations in those states increased over male registrations by between 0.5 percent and 15.9 percent. Kansas experienced the remarkable 15.9 percent jump, which likely contributed to the resounding defeat of the state’s anti-abortion ballot measure in August.\n\n\n\nA&nbsp;Quinnipiac University poll&nbsp;released on Aug. 31, disclosed that 57 percent of male registered voters and 62 percent of female voters thought abortion should be legal in most or all cases. And 64 percent of women thought it “very important” that midterm candidates share their view on abortion, compared to 44 percent of men.\n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;Dobbs&nbsp;decision caught both parties by surprise. Republicans have long used abortion as a powerful vote-getter, particularly in red states, thinking they would never have to explain how they would protect the health of women who experience life-threatening complications during pregnancy.\n\n\n\nWith the issue of abortion going back to the states, many extreme anti-abortion legislators were caught in a bind. They are no longer able to gain political points by enacting ever-tougher abortion restrictions into state law, knowing that&nbsp;Roe&nbsp;will be there to prevent those laws from going into effect. Republican candidates in purple states, sensing that draconic restrictions are not favored by a majority of voters, have been&nbsp;furiously scrubbing extreme abortion positions&nbsp;from their campaign websites. Women voters will not be fooled by such chicanery.\n\n\n\nIt will get worse for those GOP candidates. Most women either have experienced a serious pregnancy complication or know someone who has. They know that any number of dangerous conditions can arise during a pregnancy to threaten the life of the woman or viability of the fetus, or both. Between now and Election Day, there will be many heart-wrenching stories about the&nbsp;consequences of the&nbsp;Dobbs&nbsp;decision.\n\n\n\nMost pundits were predicting a Republican wave election this year until the&nbsp;Dobbs&nbsp;opinion was released.&nbsp;Some are now cautiously suggesting&nbsp;that Democrats could salvage the Senate and even retain the House, pointing to recent polls that seem to be moving in that direction.&nbsp;Naysayers claim&nbsp;that the polls are too tight and midterm election history is against the Democrats.\n\n\n\nInformed soothsayers can safely predict the election of at least 52 Democratic senators and an almost equal number of each party in the House. While other components will figure into those results (a wretched crop of Senate candidates endorsed by former President Trump and an electorate sick of the culture wars being continually stoked by the GOP), the&nbsp;Dobbs&nbsp;decision will be the primary reason for Republican losses.\n\n\n\nIt was not just the court’s radical departure from what the Trump appointees had claimed was settled precedent during their respective confirmation proceedings. The in-your-face language of the&nbsp;Dobbs&nbsp;opinion and its&nbsp;tortured recitation of the history of abortion&nbsp;in America were unsettling. When taken in context with other precedent-breaking decisions by the court’s ultra-conservative majority on a variety of issues (voting rights, gun rights, religion in school and administrative rules on climate and work-place safety), one could justifiably conclude that the court’s majority is on a mission to remake America to conform with its political and religious outlook.\n\n\n\nThe SCOTUS majority may have the raw power to advance its agenda, but it certainly does not have the political power to make it stick. The&nbsp;Dobbs&nbsp;decision is a prime example of a law that has stood the test of time — that is, the law of unintended consequences.\n\n\n\nThe American public has no way of directly calling the court majority to account for this and its other recent decisions, but the voters can and will take out their disapproval on those in federal and state offices who have supported and campaigned in favor of the outcomes arrived at by the court. The SCOTUS majority has overplayed its hand and set the stage for the Republican team to switch from a grand-slam winner to a strike-out loser in the November elections.\n\n\n\nJim Jones is a Vietnam combat veteran who served eight years as Idaho attorney general (1983-1991) and 12 years as a justice on the Idaho Supreme Court (2005-2017).

Meet the Mets\n\nWith the Washington Nationals being the Capital’s biggest disaster this side of January 6th, the Mets probably aren’t too happy about the fact they lost their second game in a row to them, this time in a 7-1 contest. \nChoose your recap: Amazin’ Avenue, NY Post, Daily News, MLB.com, Newsday, ESPN. \nIf you were surprised by Carlos Carrasco’s falling apart in Sunday’s contest, don’t feel too lonely, because he felt the same way. \nIf the season ended at this exact moment, our beautiful Metsies would be enjoying a first round bye and waiting for their division series adversary. \nOn the bright side of current events, it seems that Max Scherzer should be able to make his next scheduled start without a trip to the IL required. \nJim Reeves, the Mets’ retiring Pacific Northwest scout, threw out the first pitch before Sunday’s loss. \nMaking good on a July 26th promise to a young fan, Eduardo Escobar signed and parted ways with one of his own bats in the dugout before the game. \nAround the National League East\nNo Trumpet?\nMax Fried and the accursed Atlanta Braves easily defeated the Marlins 7-1 on Sunday afternoon in Cobb County. \nOld Friend Wilmer Flores hit a walkoff home run for the Giants to give them a 5-3 win over the third place Phillies. \nWith Jackson Mississippi dealing with a catastrophic water crisis, Braves rookie Michael Harris II \n*Ring Ring* Hello, it’s the Braves and we are only one game behind the New York Metropolitans. \nAround Major League Baseball\nIn his final career at bat against the Chicago Cubs, Albert Pujols hit hit 695th career home run. Naturally. \nIf things keep going in a sour direction for the Yankees, you may soon be able to counter every mocking taunt of “2007” with an equally rude “2022!” \nSpeaking of the Yankees, Andrew Benintendi will undergo surgery on his hamate bone leaving his status and timeline for return equally murky.  \nIn happier news for them, Aaron Judge hit his 53rd home run of the season on Sunday, setting a new career high and keeping him on pace to set a new American League record. \nYou may not have heard much about it, but Paul Goldschmidt is dangerously close to becoming the National League’s first Triple Crown winner since FDR was a two-term president. \nBefore his major league debut, Red Sox prospect Triston Casas went through with his usual routine by taking off his shoes, socks, and shirt before laying on the grass under the glow of the sun. \nThe Rangers joined the White Sox and the Diamondbacks in the not-so-exclusive DFA’d Dallas Keuchel Club. \nIn what may be his final major league season, a dodgy wrist has sent David Price to the injured list for at least the next 15 days. \nA biceps strain has put Miguel Cabrera on the shelf, but the Tigers expect to have him back in some capacity before the season comes to an end. \nThis Date in Mets History\nOn this day, we should think about Rod Barajas and The Other Chris Young on their birthdays.",

        "description": "Spain meets Thailand in this tangy grilled pork saladWhen I was young, celebrations always involved my father heading to the butcher on his motorbike. To him, restaurants were a scandalous waste of money, and cooking a beautiful piece of meat or fish at home was the proper thing to do. On a recent trip to Madrid, I was reminded of those family feasts at a barbecue where a friend had grilled the skirt of an Ibérico pig. This cut, the secreto, from behind the shoulder and marbled with fat and flavour, is most definitely for special occasions, and boy does it make for a treat. Continue reading...",

What a fun weekend. \nThe Braves swept the Marlins over the weekend, mainly thanks to the long ball on Friday and Saturday and then some timely hitting on Sunday. The pitching staff looked great (for the most part.) And as a result, the Braves have now find themselves only one game behind the Mets in the NL East Division.  \nThe Braves now have an off-day today, two games against the Athletics, and then an off-day again on Thursday. If Atlanta can continue its excellent offensive production, it can continue to put pressure on New York despite the Mets easy September schedule. The race is on, and hopefully Atlanta will be able to win a fifth straight division title. \nBraves News\n\nJackson Stephens returned from the injured list after a scary incident against the Cardinals. \nMichael Harris is stepping up to help with the water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi. \nBrad Rowland and Scott Coleman discuss a fun week of baseball in the latest edition of the Battery Power Podcast. \n\nMLB News\n\nCesar Hernandez hit his first home run in over a year to help the Nationals beat the Mets on Sunday to win the weekend series. \nAaron Judge hit his 53rd home run of the season on Sunday. \nIn pursuit of home run number 700, Albert Pujols hit number 695 on Sunday. \nAndrew Benintendi will undergo wrist surgery.

As critics of liberalism from both Left and Right, we must reject it. We acknowledge the importance of national cultures. We recognise the rightful place of the nation acting in defence of the common good on behalf of its citizens. But we cannot accept the idea that to fight globalisation we must uncritically embrace the nation-state as the one true political form, or the most complete community; or that the best good we can aim for is nation-states re-armed against each other, seeking their own interests in perpetual implied conflict. \n\nAgreed wholly. ",

I sit next to her in the garden of Serpentine North by the many pots of colours she has been using to complete her late husband’s mural. “Our main worry was, ‘Is it an Atta Kwami?’” says Pamela Clarkson Kwami, herself a painter and printmaker. “If you went too far it became a kind of caricature.”Kwami was a Ghanaian painter and art theorist with a generous, joyous abstract vision whose working life looked set to move into a new gear when he won the Maria Lassnig prize in 2021, an award for a “mid-career” artist that includes a public art commission for London’s Serpentine gallery. Kwami was born in 1956 and spent years teaching and researching before he could afford to paint full-time: a perfect recipient for this anti-ageist art prize. However, Kwami had cancer. He died last October just as his work was beginning to receive the acclaim it deserved – and with his design for a mural at the Serpentine yet to be realised. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Read novel by Tim Winton by Contributors to Wikimedia projects\nGeorgie, the heroine of the book, becomes fascinated while watching a stranger attempting to poach fish in an area where nobody can maintain secrets for very long; disillusioned with her relationship with the local fisherman legend Jim Buckridge, she contrives a meeting with the stranger and soon passion runs out of control between two bruised and emotionally fragile people.\r\n\r\nThe secret quickly becomes impossible to hide, and Jim wants revenge, whilst the poacher hikes north via Wittenoom (out of respect for his father who died of mesothelioma in the town) and Broome to an island off the remote coast of Kimberley beyond Kununurra to escape a confrontation. His subsequent struggles to survive in the hostile environment, knowing that he must try to literally cover his tracks, give this book its gripping denouement.\nI decided to read Dirt Music after reading Cloudstreet and listening to Tim Winton speak on Radio National. For me the novel had three key elements, fractured characters, the journeys we go on and the place of space. I think Magdalena Ball captures the novel well in her review.\n\nDirt Music is a big sprawling novel about the ancient Australian land, about loss, life, death, and redemption, about change and stagnation, but above all about love, and its power to change people. Peopled with small, recognisable, and believable characters, and deep, intense themes, the prose is poetic, and powerful, and at times, the structure experimental, but it is possible to read this book solely for the plot. Fast, engaging, and stunningly beautiful, Dirt Music is the kind of book that can, and should be read, and re-read.\n http://www.compulsivereader.com/2003/03/20/a-review-of-tim-wintons-dirt-music/\n\n\nIt was a strange novel. I kept looking for something drastic to happen, only to realise that things were happening all of the time, crashing over us like waves. Sometimes we just have to notice. \nMy favourite part of the novel was the description of space. For me, I was taken back to my time in Lancelin a few years ago. I remember travelling north to see the Pinnicles, but we never ventured beyond that. Sadly, I never got the promised fresh lobster. As a place, I always had a feeling that there was always something more happening.  The post 📚 Dirt Music (Tim Winton) first appeared on Read Write Collect.",

        "description": "Read Cloudstreet by Tim Winton by Contributors to Wikimedia projects\nCloudstreet is a novel by Australian writer Tim Winton published in 1991. It chronicles the lives of two working-class families, the Pickles and the Lambs, who come to live together in a large house called Cloudstreet in Perth over a period of twenty years, 1943 to 1963. The novel received several awards, including a Miles Franklin Award in 1992, and has been adapted into various forms, including a stage play and a television miniseries.\nI listened to this book via the ABC Listen App, which provides a selection of different Australian novels to listen to. The tail of two families, the Lambs and the Pickles, whose lives are brought together in a large house on Cloudstreet. I was engrossed by all the different characters and what each brought to the story. I also liked the way the novel placed itself in time by referencing various events through time. I was intrigued to find out that the novel was based on Winton&#8217;s own family history, with it serving as something of an honouring of the past.The post 📚 Cloudstreet (Tim Winton) first appeared on Read Write Collect.",

A thank you to Justin and Jim for covering my Snake Bytes the last 3 weeks so I could sweat my ass off on a Spanish beach.\nDiamondbacks News\n[AZ Central] Zac Gallen ties scoreless start record, Diamondbacks take 3 of 4 from Brewers\n“I’m only an inning away (from passing Webb) so I might as well just try,” Gallen said.\n[Sports Illustrated] Zac Gallen throws 7 scoreless innings in Diamondbacks 5-1 win over Brewers\nSurprisingly Gallen felt it was hard for him to get in a groove through the first three innings, saying he didn’t have a great feeling for anything and thought he was behind in the count a lot. Of his first 22 pitches just 11 were strikes and he said he was “just spraying fastballs”. But by the 4th inning he was able to get back in the zone and attack using his full repertoire. ”I’m at my best when I’m using all my pitches and try not to eliminate those pitches” Gallen said. \n“Torey Lovullo confirmed the team is using a 6 man rotation” - Jack Sommers on Sports Illustrated\n[Sports Illustrated] Diamondbacks’ Zac Gallen Extends Scoreless Innings Streak to 41.1\nGallen is now just two outs away from tying Brandon Webb for the franchise’s longest scoreless innings streak. Webb went 42 innings without allowing a run in the 2007 season, a season in which Webb finished second in National League Cy Young voting.\n[dbacks.com] Gallen joins Drysdale, Hershiser, Greinke with rare feat\nGallen’s streak is the eighth longest in the Live Ball Era (since 1920). He is the fourth AL/NL pitcher in the Modern Era (since 1900) to throw six or more scoreless innings in six straight starts, joining Don Drysdale (1968), Orel Hershiser (1988) and Zack Greinke (2015).\n[Arizona Sports] D-backs take series over Brewers as righty Zac Gallen keeps scoreless streak alive\n“This was another day for Zac,” Lovullo said. “He goes out there and executes at a very high level and throws up seven more zeros. So, he spoils us. But, it’s because he’s working his butt off. It’s because he’s executing. It’s because of the four, five days in between starts that he is studying, working to make good things happen. It’s not by accident that he’s on this tremendous run.”\n[Sports Illustrated] Arizona Diamondbacks Can Contend in National League in 2023\nLast week on the Jack Vita Show, former Colorado Rockies’ general manager and current MLB Network analyst Dan O’Dowd spoke about the Diamondbacks and the potential they have to compete in the National League West soon. \n“I think Mike Hazen is one of the best GM’s in the game” - former Colorado Rockies’ general manager and current MLB Network analyst Dan O’Dowd\n“I look at that team right now and I think, ‘Darn, they’re a shortstop away for me from being this really, really good team. If they have the ability to fish in one of these (free agent) shortstops, I think they’re really close to being a really good team.”\nAround The MLB\n[mlb.com] NL East tightens after Mets drop ‘letdown’ set\nThe Mets’ most pressing on-field issue this weekend was the offense, which managed two combined runs Saturday and Sunday against a Nationals staff with MLB’s worst ERA. It’s a funk for a lineup averaging more than 4.6 runs per game, but just three per game over its past 12 contests. The Mets are hitting only .173 (13-for-75) with runners in scoring position during that stretch. \n[mlb.com] Dodgers’ magic number down to single digits\nBecause the Dodgers locked up the season series against the Padres with their 10th win of the head-to-head matchup, Los Angeles’ magic number to win the division dropped from 12 to nine with the victory. The earliest they can clinch a postseason spot is Friday.\n[MLB Trade Rumors] Dodgers Sign Keone Kela To Minor League Deal\nKela was released last week by the D-Backs after returning from TJ and signed in LA. Since the transaction was realised on the final day in August, in theory he is eligible for post-season work.\n[MLB Trade Rumors] Royals Outright Daniel Mengden\nMengden haunts me in my dreams ever since doing a specific recap where Mengden pitched a complete game shutout.\n[ESPN] Texas Rangers designate Dallas Keuchel for assignment after two starts\nThe 34-year-old Keuchel was 0-2 with a 12.60 ERA in two starts for the Rangers, including taking the loss Friday when he allowed seven runs in 4 2/3 innings.\n[CBS Sports] MLB’s top 10 September storylines\nWhat does the final month of the 2022 MLB regular season have in store? Lots of good stuff, including more than one milestone chase. Here are the top 10 storylines heading into September.\nAcross The Atlantic\n[The Netherlands] “Blind Baseball is the only sport I can perform independently”\nLisa Kuppern expressed how visually impaired players feel when playing blind baseball. “The freedom I feel when I’m able to run alone is amazing. Blind baseball is the only sport I can perform completely independently and free. It is baseball, the game hasn’t undergone huge changes. We hit the ball, run, field, throw and whoever dares even makes sliding.”\nAcross The Wall\n[Colombia] Luis Urueta to manage Colombia in World Baseball Classic 2023\nMLB’s Arizona Diamondbacks coach led Colombia to their first World Baseball Classic appearance in 2017. WBSC Baseball Division board member Jimmy Char will act as the general manager, and former MLB superstar Edgar Renteria will be the sports manager.",

We’ll be going by Team Game because not every player’s seasons were in sync with the calendar days and everyone didn’t play all of the team’s games, which makes this our universal standard. Now, for Game 134:\nAaron Judge through Game 134 of 2022: 53 HR\nTeam Game 134: 9/4 — 3-for-5, 1 HR, 1 2B, 1 RBI, 2 R\nAaron Judge was given a rare day leading off the lineup, and he wasted no time treating the fans inside Tropicana Field to a show. On the second pitch of the game Judge hammered a solo shot out to left field, reaching the third deck in a prime display of his incredible power. The blast officially put him past his previous career-high for homers with 53, surpassing his mark from his Rookie of the Year 2017 season.\n\n\n.@TheJudge44 sets a career high in homers on September 4th. Will we see history this season? pic.twitter.com/gc9ifNxD3n— MLB (@MLB) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nThat’s eight and counting for Judge to match Roger Maris, and at this point he’s smack in the middle of several of the players in this series. Could we dare dream of a season where Judge not only passes Maris but threatens Sosa or McGuire’s marks? We can only sit and wait to see.\nRoger Maris through Game 134 of 1961: 51 HR\nTeam Game 134: 9/1 — 0-for-4, 1 K\nMaris’ first game in September saw him stay on 51 for his season total, going 0-for against the Tigers in another frustrating game. The Yankees could’ve used either of the M&amp;M Brothers producing something in this one to add some insurance, but they were able to hold onto a 1-0 lead regardless to fend off the Tigers.\nBabe Ruth through Game 134 of 1927: 49 HR\nTeam Game 134: 9/7 — 4-for-5, 2 HR, 1 2B, 5 RBI, 3 R, 1 K\nRuth’s charge to 60 through September had two critical runs, and this is the end of the first one — he hit his fourth and fifth homers in three days in this game. Ruth began with a solo shot in the first inning to get the Yankees on the board, and then in the eighth inning he stepped up and provided a two-run blast that would provide the decisive runs. Without his efforts, New York would’ve dropped a winnable game to a terrible Red Sox team after allowing eight runs in the fourth inning — instead, the Bambino tortured his old team and the Yanks handled business against a bad team (funny, that).\nBarry Bonds through Game 134 of 2001: 56 HR\nTeam Game 134: 8/30 — 1-for-2, 3 BB\nThe Diamondbacks wanted no part of Bonds on this night, walking him three times. Though he didn’t score on any of those opportunities, the rest of the Giants lineup mashed to the tune of 13 runs. The Giants opted to lift Bonds for a pinch-runner in the eighth after it became clear that he wouldn’t get another opportunity to mash a homer.\nMark McGwire through Game 134 of 1998: 54 HR\nTeam Game 134: 8/27 — 0-for-4, 1 K\nNot much to report on here from McGwire, who had a quiet night as his Cardinals’ late rally against Atlanta fell short. This was the final game of a six-game losing streak for St. Louis, firmly establishing themselves outside of the postseason hunt despite the prolific season McGwire was having.\nSammy Sosa through Game 134 of 1998: 52 HR\nTeam Game 134: 8/27 — 2-for-5, 1 RBI, 1 R, 1 BB, 1 K\nSosa wouldn’t homer on this day, but he did contribute to a narrow victory over Colorado. Sosa singled off of Pedro Astacio in the fifth inning, driving home a run and moving to third a batter later. The Cubs went on to win by a single run in extras, so they needed every ounce of offense they got in this one.",

        "description": "Photo by Justin Berl/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The AL Wild Card race stayed hot as Toronto swept the Pirates before heading into a crucial series with the Orioles. The Yankees defeated the Rays yesterday pushing their AL East lead back to five games. The rest of the AL was in action as well, though, and the Wild Card race stayed hot. Toronto was looking for a sweep ahead of a big AL East showdown this week, while the Astros were looking to maintain their grip on the top seed in the league. Here’s what went down.\n\nToronto Blue Jays 4 (73-59), Pittsburgh Pirates 3 (49-84)\n\nThe Blue Jays needed to show out in this series, locked in a tight battle for an AL Wild Card spot. They got the job done, holding on in the series finale in Pittsburgh to secure a crucial sweep of the Pirates.\nThings got hairy in the ninth, with the Pirates putting two runners on in the ninth with no outs. Closer Jordan Romano came through, however, striking out three consecutive batters to strand the winning runners in scoring position:\n\nThe Jays had jumped out to an early 3-0 lead, but saw the Pirates stay in the fight, with Josh VanMeter doubling home two in the fifth, and Oneil Cruz crushing his 12th homer of the year to tie the game in the sixth:\n\nTeoscar Hernández singled home a run in the seventh to put Toronto up 4-3, and the Toronto bullpen made the lead stand up. The Jays will try to ride the momentum from this sweep into a crucial upcoming series with the Orioles. Toronto stands 2.5 games ahead of Baltimore in the standings entering the showdown.\n\nSeattle Mariners 6 (76-58), Cleveland Guardians 3 (68-64)\n\nThe Mariners stay one of the hottest teams in baseball. Not even a four-hour long rain delay could deter Seattle, as they waited out the weather, and extra innings, to secure a sweep in Cleveland and win their seventh consecutive game.\nIt didn’t always look like this game would take several hours to complete. Ty France doubled in a run in the second, and Julio Rodríguez gave Seattle a 2-1 lead with his 23rd homer — part of a four-hit night.\n\nThat’s when the rains came. When the game finally restarted, with starters George Kirby and Cal Quantrill long since forgotten, Seattle extended the lead to 3-1 in the fourth, but their bullpen couldn’t quite win things in regulation. Austin Hedges managed an RBI single in the seventh off Diego Castillo, and Oscar Gonzalez tied things up with an RBI single of his own in the eighth off former Yankee farmhand Erik Swanson.\nThe Guardians had their chance to end things in the 10th, loading the bases with two outs, but couldn’t bring the winning run home, with Tyler Freeman flying out. The Mariners wouldn’t allow the misstep to stand, with J.P. Crawford singling home a run in the top of the 11th, before Cal Raleigh fired the kill shot:\n\nChris Flexen managed the bottom half of the inning for his second save. The Mariners remain in excellent position in the Wild Card race, two games clear of the field. FanGraphs assesses their playoff chances at better than 99 percent.\n\nHouston Astros 9 (86-48), Los Angeles Angels 1 (58-76)\n\nThe Yankees’ chances of securing the top seed in the AL have pretty much completely evaporated, so you’d be forgiven for not being too interested in Houston’s work down the stretch. Still, it was notable to see a good team do what they’re supposed to do against a doormat like the Angels. The Astros cruised past Anaheim on Sunday to secure a straightforward series win over the Angels.\nHouston hung a five-spot in the second and didn’t look back. Kyle Tucker started things off with a two-run homer, and David Hensley doubled the lead with a two-run double. Jose Altuve added an RBI double to put the Astros up 5-0. \nThe Angels asked starter Tucker Davidson to wear it, letting him work through the disaster second, and he responded fairly well, holding Houston down across the third through sixth frames. Houston finally knocked Davidson out when Altuve launched a two-run homer to give Houston a 7-0 advantage:\n\nJose Urquidy made the support stand up, tossing seven shutout and making short work of an Angels lineup that was missing Shohei Ohtani. With the win, the Astros remained 5.5 games ahead of the Yankees in the AL hierarchy.\nOther Contenders\n\n\nMinnesota Twins 5 (68-64), Chicago White Sox 1 (67-67): A day after nearly getting no-hit, the Twins bounced back nicely, roping 12 hits against Lucas Giolito and the Chicago staff. Carlos Correa picked up two hits and a solo homer to back up Dylan Bundy’s five shutout innings. With Cleveland’s loss to Seattle, the Twins are now tied with the Guardians atop the AL Central; they’re also two games up on the White Sox.\n\nOakland Athletics 5 (50-85), Baltimore Orioles 0 (71-62): Right-hander Adrian Martinez, fresh off shoving against the Yankees last weekend, kept up his hot streak, firing six shutout against Baltimore. Seth Brown paced the offense, smashing two solo homers and scoring three times.",

        "description": "Photo by Chris Bernacchi/Diamond Images via Getty Images\n    \n\n  A recap of Sunday in the Dodgers minors.\nPlayer of the day\nAndre Jackson entered with a two-run lead in the bottom of the sixth inning, trying to protect a lead for Oklahoma City after Round Rock won three of the previous four games in their final at-bat. All Jackson did was face the minimum over four innings, striking out three, earning the four-inning save to secure the series finale.\nJackson allowed a single and a walk, but both were erased on double plays. He needed only 41 pitches to get through his four innings. The right-hander also has the last three-inning (or longer) save by a Dodger, doing so on the final day of the 2021 season.\nTriple-A Oklahoma City\nAfter losing four straight games, Oklahoma City left Round Rock with a win over the Express (Rangers) on Sunday to widen their league in the Pacific Coast League East Division to two games with 21 games left to play.\nCatcher Hunter Feduccia had an RBI double. Michael Busch and James Outman each had two hits, including an RBI single. Outman was 9-for-21 (.429) in the series with nine runs batted in.\nMichael Grove struck out five in his five innings to earn the win, allowing three runs (one earned).\nDouble-A Tulsa\nJustin Yurchak had four hits, driving in a run in the Drillers’ win over the Northwest Arkansas Naturals (Royals). Tulsa had eight hits on the night, all singles. Shortstop Leonel Valera had one of them and was hit by a pitch. He stole a base and scored twice in the win.\nNick Nastrini struck out six in four innings, but also walked four and allowed two runs. Gus Varland struck out out two in two perfect innings to close out the win, earning his second save.\nHigh-A Great Lakes\nAustin Gauthier hit a walk-off home run to salvage a doubleheader split for the Loons against the Lake County Captains (Guardians). The infielder had been walking since his promotion to High-A, with 13 in 15 games, but had just seven hits in 47 at-bats with Great Lakes (.149) before the home run.\nBen Harris struck out four in two innings to earn the win in the second game, which was a makeup of Saturday’s rainout.\nLoons Game 1 starter Ronan Kopp needed 32 pitches to record only two outs, walking two batters, allowing a single, and a pair of unearned runs. It’s been a rough patch for Kopp since getting promoted to High-A, walking six of his 13 batters faced in two starts.\nLow-A Rancho Cucamonga\nThe Quakes staved off elimination by holding on to beat the Inland Empire 66ers (Angels) on the road.\nEvery Rancho Cucamonga starter reached base, eight had hits, and eight scored. Dalton Rushing was 3-for-4 with a double and a walk.\nTransactions\nTriple-A: Ryan Pepiot was recalled to the majors.\nSunday scores\n\n\nOklahoma City 5, Round Rock 3 \n\nTulsa 4, Northwest Arkansas 2 \nGame 1 — Lake County 4, Great Lakes 0 (7 innings) \nGame 2 — Great Lakes 3, Lake County 2 (7 innings)\n\n\nRancho Cucamonga 11, Inland Empire 10 \n\nTuesday schedule\n\n9:05 a.m. PT: Tulsa at Frisco (Rangers)\n3:35 p.m.: Great Lakes at West Michigan (Tigers)\n5:05 p.m.: Oklahoma City vs. Tacoma (Mariners)\n6:30 p.m.: Rancho Cucamonga vs. Lake Elsinore (Padres)\n\nAll four affiliates are off Monday.",

        "description": "In his last days as prime minister of Britain, Boris Johnson conducted a farewell tour of the country. Possibly he expected something like the accolades his beloved Roman generals were given—a small arch in his honor, say—or at least a few angry Gauls walking miserably behind his chariot. Instead he went to a field in southwest England and stared at a hole in the ground.The hole will one day be filled by superfast internet cables, but it could equally serve as the grave of Johnson’s hopes to be remembered as something other than the prime minister who “got Brexit done.” After he oversaw Britain’s departure from the European Union, the coronavirus intervened, and his government’s domestic agenda stalled amid scandals over lockdown parties and wallpaper and corruption. His own ministers brought him down in July, at which point he announced he would stay on as a “caretaker” until the Conservative Party could choose his replacement. The country that Johnson has handed over to his successor has been stuck in limbo all summer, anxious and adrift.His foreign secretary, Liz Truss, replaces him today, and has inherited not so much an in tray as a portal to a nightmare dimension. COVID-19 was a headline-dominating crisis. Truss must confront one of those—the imminent spike in energy bills—but also a flotilla of other problems, including high inflation, widespread labor unrest, and long waits for medical treatment. Whatever the opposite of a honeymoon is, that’s what she’s facing. “We will deliver, we will deliver, we will deliver,” Truss told the party after her victory was announced—in a flat, boilerplate acceptance speech that was more reminiscent of the awkward, earnest prose of former prime minister Theresa May than Truss’s immediate predecessor, the clownish, charismatic Boris Johnson.  The first order of business will be tackling the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year and by increased demand as the pandemic fades. In Britain, the average gas and electricity bills of ordinary households are capped by a regulator based on wholesale costs. By October, the typical bill will be three times what it was 12 months earlier, and it is expected to rise again in January. Things are so dystopian that the prize on a breakfast show’s call-in competition today was getting your energy bill paid for the next four months. One well-regarded forecaster expects the average British household to be paying the equivalent of £6,616 ($7,633) a year in gas and electricity bills by April.[Read: ‘We’re not going to make that mistake again’]Think that’s exorbitant? No price cap exists for businesses and public bodies. Restaurants, museums, nursing homes, and schools are already warning that they cannot cope. Some areas are planning to turn public buildings into “warm banks”—like food banks—for those who can’t afford to heat their homes. For many white-collar Britons, now used to working several days a week from home, high energy bills might drive them back into offices.Truss can’t do much about gas prices on the European wholesale market. Russia is a major gas supplier to Europe, and Vladimir Putin fully exploits the leverage this gives him in foreign affairs. Nonetheless, the new prime minister will face enormous pressure to support British households through the winter. So far, Truss has rejected the idea of more direct support, insisting that tax cuts are her economic focus. Yesterday she said something no British leader has said for decades: that the richest would gain most from her tax policy, and she thought that was fair. “To look at everything through the lens of redistribution I believe is wrong because what I’m about is about growing the economy and growing the economy benefits everybody,” she told the BBC.Her embrace of the Laffer curve, a beloved theory on the right contested by mainstream economists, suggests Truss will govern as she has campaigned, at least in this contest. The new Tory leader, who is 47, began her political career as a Liberal Democrat—a centrist—and voted to remain in the European Union in 2016. Since then, though, she has tacked sharply to the right, and has been rewarded with the support of the Conservative Party’s libertarian and socially conservative members. With such a base, she will find it difficult to run bigger deficits to fund government expenditure. And energy bills are far from the only problem facing average Britons. Every public service in the country is crying out for money after a decade of austerity, the disruption of COVID, and now the effects of high inflation. (The current figure is 10.1 percent, and Goldman Sachs predicts it will reach 22 percent next year.)Taking a train somewhere? Brace yourself for the trip to be canceled, or the car full to bursting: Railway workers have been striking on and off all summer. Waiting to give evidence in a criminal case? The justice system has been beset by delays since the beginning of the pandemic, and prosecutors and criminal-defense lawyers have announced what the BBC describes as an “indefinite, uninterrupted” strike, beginning today. Want to mail a letter? Postal workers have two more strike days scheduled in the next fortnight. Need your cataracts fixed or your hip replaced? Some 6.6 million Britons—2 million more than before the pandemic—are currently on the National Health Service’s waiting list for nonurgent medical care. Need an ambulance? Over the summer, one 87-year-old man with a cracked pelvis waited 15 hours outside his house after a fall. His family made him a makeshift shelter out of a soccer goal, trash bags, and umbrellas.What makes this omni-crisis even more alarming is how few economic levers Truss can pull. She can’t reverse Brexit, or even soften its implementation: Her party’s activists would eat her alive. A classic response to high inflation is to raise interest rates, but this is a fraught decision in Britain, a country bloated with mortgage debt. In any case, interest rates are set by the Bank of England, rather than the prime minister’s government, to protect them from political interference. Truss made noises about reviewing the bank’s independence during the campaign; yesterday she tried to disavow that suggestion.[Helen Lewis: The Brexit revolution that wasn’t]Why pick fights voluntarily, when there is so much else to worry about? She might have been playing to the Conservative base to win the leadership election. The only people eligible to vote were dues-paying party members, so Truss spent all summer courting the populist right. Late last month, she was asked whether French President Emmanuel Macron was a “friend or foe.” The answer should have been simple: France is both a key security partner and the favored destination of Britons looking for a nearby sunny beach. And yet: “Jury’s out,” replied Truss. Macron was pleasingly insouciant about the insult, responding to reporters with a perfect Gallic shrug and a long exhalation. Britain, he said, was a strong ally of France, “regardless of its leaders, and sometimes in spite of its leaders.” Other fights are less likely to go away: As a born-again Brexiteer, Truss is preparing for a showdown with the EU over the special status of Northern Ireland. And although culture-war issues have receded in the leadership contest, as the scale of the economic challenge became apparent, Truss’s flouting of progressive orthodoxies (“I’m very clear that a woman is a woman,” she declared at Wembley Arena) is a guaranteed applause line for right-wing audiences.What skills does Truss bring to this nightmare situation? As the most recent foreign minister, she will be well briefed on the war in Ukraine, the state of EU negotiations, and the risk of relying on imported energy. She has the capacity for intellectual change, having traveled from liberal to conservative, and Remainer to Brexiteer. She has been preparing to be prime minister—plotting, if we’re being unkind—since long before the position became officially vacant, and therefore has her ministerial team already picked and an emergency financial statement scheduled for the next few weeks.Critics look at Britain’s third female prime minister, with her ink-blue blouses and her purple rhetoric, and call her a Margaret Thatcher tribute act. The test now will be whether Truss can face down an economic crisis as severe as anything her predecessor faced in the 1980s, without dividing the country in the way that Thatcher did.Good luck, Liz Truss. You’re going to need it.",

        "description": "Read Barracuda\nFourteen-year-old Daniel Kelly is special. Despite his upbringing in working-class Melbourne, he knows that his astonishing ability in the swimming pool has the potential to transform his life. Everything Danny has ever done, every sacrifice his family has ever made, has been in pursuit of this dream--but what happens when the talent that makes you special fails you? When the goal that you’ve been pursuing for as long as you can remember ends in humiliation and loss?\r\n\r\nTwenty years later, Dan is in Scotland, terrified to tell his partner about his past, afraid that revealing what he has done will make him unlovable. Haunted by shame, Dan relives the intervening years he spent in prison, where the optimism of his childhood was completely foreign.\r\n\nAlthough I had seen and enjoyed the television adaptations of both The Slap and Barracuda, I had never actually read any of Christos Tsiolkas&#8217; novels. I was partly inspired after listening to Tsiolkas in conversation with Waleed Aly and Scott Stephens, also Barracuda was the only novel available on Libro.fm.\nThe novel revolves around Daniel Kelly, the son of working class Scots-Irish and Greek parents who gains a scholarship to a prodigious private school because of his swimming abilities, but fails to make it to the Olympics.\n\nWhere The Slap had an ensemble cast and Tolstoy-esque ambitions — it sought to render the whole milieu of the multiethnic, suburban Melbourne that is Tsiolkas’s heartland — Barracuda trains its sights firmly on Danny Kelly. Even so, all the characters are vividly drawn.\nJo Lennan https://themillions.com/2014/09/how-far-he-had-fallen-christos-tsiolkass-barracuda.html\n\n\nMark Lawson on language:\n\nTsiolkas&#8217;s sometimes startling dialogue is part of his mission – along with explicit descriptions of urination, defecation and ejaculation – to set down the texture of how people really live and speak. His characters have a visceral credibility rare in&nbsp;fiction.\nMark Lawson https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/03/barracuda-christos-tsiolkas-review?utm_source=pocket_mylist\n\n\nThere is something strangely engaging about this novel in the way that the problem is referenced early on, the rest of the time we bounce between a before and after, piecing things together. For me, every choice that Dan Kelly makes comes with its own set of consequences. Although we get some sort of resolution in the end, when Kelly gives a gift back to his family, this does not necessarily remedy all of life&#8217;s ills, nor does it break free of the restraints placed on us by society.The post 📚 Barracuda (Christos Tsiolkas) first appeared on Read Write Collect.",

        "description": "Britain&#x27;s Prime Minister-elect Liz Truss pledged to deliver on a range of issues after being named the new Conservative Party leader on Monday. Truss will be the U.K.&#x27;s third female prime minister, following Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May.Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty ImagesUpdated September 5, 2022 at 8:53 AM ETBritain&#x27;s Conservative Party has announced its new leader is Liz Truss, who has served as foreign minister for the past 12 months. She will be formally appointed as the next prime minister by Queen Elizabeth, likely on Tuesday afternoon.&quot;I will deliver a bold plan to cut taxes and grow our economy,&quot; Truss said in her victory speech, adding that she will also take on challenges from high energy bills to the National Health Service.The result follows a nationwide vote by the party&#x27;s grassroots members that lasted several weeks this summer. Truss will become the country&#x27;s fourth leader in a politically turbulent six-year period.It marks only the third time in history that a woman will assume power in 10 Downing Street, but the third time in recent years that a change of prime minister has occurred without a national general election.&quot;We will deliver, we will deliver, and we will deliver,&quot; Truss said, echoing a key campaign theme. &quot;And we will deliver a great victory for the Conservative Party in 2024&quot; — when the next national elections are slated to be held.Truss replaces Boris Johnson, who was laid low by a succession of scandals that crescendoed in the first half of this year. After losing support of not only the majority of his fellow Conservative legislators, but also many of his own ministers, he was forced to resign.Truss spent the summer campaigning against Rishi Sunak, the U.K.&#x27;s former finance minister who was her rival for the Conservative leadership. The contest was decided by the votes of almost 142,000 party members. Truss secured more than 81,000 of those votes, the lowest proportion of any leader in recent history.Johnson has continued to serve as a caretaker leader for the past few months, and he is expected to meet with the monarch in Scotland on Tuesday to tender his official resignation.As new leader, Truss will likely make a statement outside 10 Downing Street later Tuesday. She will immediately face responsibility for a rapidly escalating energy crisis in Britain, with both consumers and companies facing record high gas and electricity costs thanks to the war in Ukraine, and the corresponding rise in inflation threatening to tip the country into a major recession.Truss, who had already been dubbed &quot;PM in waiting&quot; by one British newspaper, said in an interview with the BBC this weekend that she will formulate proposals to combat this economic challenge within days, and is aiming to &quot;act immediately.&quot;Earlier in the leadership contest, Truss did not command as much support among fellow Conservative legislators as her opponent Sunak. And even though Sunak has promised to support a new government even if he is not leader, political analysts have said it will be difficult for Truss to unify her divided Conservatives, who still enjoy a sizable majority in the country&#x27;s parliament — thanks, ironically, to Johnson&#x27;s huge success as a campaigner during the last national elections.At the announcement, the party&#x27;s co-chairman, Andrew Stevenson, said the long, drawn-out contest this summer — involving the two &quot;fantastic&quot; candidates fielding hundreds of questions from tens of thousands of members — showed that the party remained &quot;in good voice and good strength.&quot; He also drew a long round of applause when he thanked Johnson, who &quot;rose to the challenge and delivered,&quot; throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently the conflict in Ukraine. Truss also thanked Johnson, describing him as a friend who was &quot;admired from Kyiv to Carlisle.&quot;Before announcing the result, Sir Graham Brady, who oversees the committee of Conservative legislators responsible for selecting a new leader, said the ballot had been &quot;free and fair,&quot; thanked the party members and all candidates, and said both Truss and Sunak were &quot;outstanding&quot; and had run &quot;excellent campaigns.&quot; Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "Gearing up for fall, health officials are recommending a new round of booster shots.Rogelio V. Solis/APThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending updated COVID boosters, for people ages 12 and older. These newly authorized shots are reformulated versions of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines and they&#x27;re available at pharmacies, clinics and doctors&#x27; offices around the country. The boosters target both the original strain of the coronavirus and the two omicron subvariants which are causing most of the current infections. Vaccine makers have scrambled to rejigger the vaccines as they&#x27;ve become less effective against new variants. &quot;This virus has been mutating so quickly over the past two years,&quot; says Judith Guzman-Cottrill, an infectious disease specialist at Oregon Health &amp; Science University. &quot;I feel like we&#x27;ve been playing catch up and finally we have caught up,&quot; Guzman-Cottrill says.Pfizer&#x27;s updated booster is available for anyone 12 and older. The Moderna booster is available for anyone 18 and older. &quot;If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your COVID-19 booster,&#x27;&#x27; CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told NPR. &quot;I strongly encourage you to receive it,&quot; she says.But after talking to several infectious disease experts, we found there&#x27;s a whole range of opinions on who needs to boost and when. So, if you are navigating this decision, here are some things to consider:Who needs a booster as soon as possible? &quot;I would recommend this booster shot for those who are immunocompromised or those who are 60 years [old] and above,&quot; says Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco. Gandhi says people in these groups are at highest risk. According to CDC guidance, people are eligible if it&#x27;s been at least two months since they received their last COVID shot, either a booster or an initial vaccine, but some vaccine experts say it would be better to wait at least four months.&quot;I will get it,&quot; says Physician Bob Wachter, who&#x27;s in his mid-60s and in good health. &quot;I&#x27;m about eight months out from shot number four. And so my immunity has waned significantly,&quot; Wachter says. He plans to get an updated booster as soon as it&#x27;s available as a hedge against serious infection, given COVID is still circulating widely with about 400 deaths per day.&quot;There&#x27;s no question that getting a booster  increases the likelihood that you&#x27;ll have a benign case,&quot; if you do get infected, he says.Wachter also agrees with the CDC recommendation that younger adults get the booster. Boosting can protect against the risk of long COVID and helps protect the community at large by reducing transmission, if there&#x27;s another surge, he says. &quot;There are good reasons to get it, even for people that have a low chance of a super severe infection,&quot; Wachter says.When does it make sense to wait?If you&#x27;ve had a recent COVID infection, it makes sense to wait.Guzman-Cottrill and her children had mild infections in August, so she says she&#x27;ll wait until November to get boosted. &quot;Our natural antibody response will protect us against COVID for another few months. So I do think it makes sense to wait and get the updated booster about three months after our positive COVID test,&quot; she says.This is in line with the recommendation from CDC vaccine advisers — people who recently had  COVID-19 may consider delaying a booster shot by three months. That&#x27;s what the country&#x27;s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci says he plans to do. Fauci tested positive in mid-June and says he&#x27;ll wait three months before he gets his updated booster.Guzman-Cottrill says both her teenagers will also get the new booster &quot;to protect us from COVID this winter so we can avoid sick days from work and from school,&quot; she says.Can I time my shot for maximum protection at the holidays? It won&#x27;t be a surprise if there&#x27;s another COVID surge this coming winter. Since the protection from boosters may only last several months, some people say they plan to wait to get the new booster in order to have maximum protection when the risk of infection is higher. &quot;You can make a rational argument to wait until case rates are higher,&quot; says Wachter. If you&#x27;re trying to time it for the period of highest risk, he says, there are likely to be a ton more cases in December and January than there are in September and October.However, Wachter says, this strategy is a bit like trying to time the stock market. It&#x27;s hard to predict exactly when the surge will happen, so there&#x27;s a risk in waiting. &quot;You are basically accepting a period of vulnerability that you don&#x27;t need to have,&quot; he says. &quot;And as I weigh all that, my thinking is I&#x27;d rather not do that.&quot;Another argument against waiting is that the protection from a booster shot is not instantaneous. &quot;It does take a few weeks for our immune systems to be primed,&quot; says Dr. Aniruddha Hazra, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Chicago. He says it could be risky to wait until a surge is already underway.Hazra points out the vaccines can activate our immune systems in a few ways. Immune cells, known as B cells, help produce antibodies that fight off the virus in the short-term. Research shows COVID vaccines boost antibodies for several months, but then they begin to fade. After that, B cells and another type of immune cell, known as T cells, which can destroy infected cells, stick around to build a deeper immunity.He says this deeper immunity was triggered and primed from the initial vaccines, so everyone who&#x27;s been vaccinated should have some protection against COVID But given the omicron subvariants circulating now are so different. &quot;This [new] booster will definitely provide you with higher levels of antibodies, which are short term and short lived. It may also provide more deep-seated immunity,&quot; he says.Will the new booster shots prevent COVID infections completely? No. There&#x27;s lots of enthusiasm for the updated boosters, but they are not a magic bulletAs SARS-CoV-2 has evolved, it&#x27;s become more transmissible, which is why delta and omicron led to such large surges, despite widespread vaccination in the U.S.&quot;The goal of this vaccine is to prevent severe illness,&quot; says Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia. He argues that many people who&#x27;ve already received three doses of vaccine remain well protected, so he doesn&#x27;t see a clear benefit to giving the new boosters to everyone 12 and up. According to CDC data, people who have had one or two boosters have a 0.024% chance of being hospitalized with COVID-19. For people under 50, it&#x27;s even lower — 0.014%Offit agrees that certain groups should receive the new booster including elderly adults, people who are immunocompromised and those with chronic conditions that put them at higher risk of serious illness. But he questions the value of another booster for healthy, younger people.Offit says he had a mild infection in May that lasted a few days. He&#x27;s decided against getting the new booster. &quot;I think I&#x27;m protected against serious disease.&quot;\nThe new boosters offer a few months&#x27; protection against infection, he says, but there&#x27;s no clear evidence of benefit beyond that.\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "From debates about plastic bags to guilt about bringing children into the world, environmental issues are increasingly shaping our relationshipsWhen Mitzi Jonelle Tan first saw Jon Bonifacio at a student council meeting at the University of the Philippines in 2017, she knew she liked him. But it wasn’t his good looks or sense of humour that got her swooning: it was his interest in climate activism. “I looked at him and knew we could be activists together,” she says. They went on to spend four years together as a couple, and even after splitting up earlier this year they remain close.For Tan and Bonifacio, both 24, who are climate activists for the Fridays For Future movement, finding a partner with shared values isn’t optional – it’s a must. “Of course there are reasons I love her outside our climate work,” says Bonifacio. “But it’s a fundamental part of our relationship.” They are not alone.

        "description": "Photo by Michael Owens/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Every Dodgers-Giants series in 2022 has ended in a sweep. That streak gets put on the line with the Dodgers hosting the Giants for three games beginning Monday night at Dodger Stadium.\nThe last two meetings went the Dodgers’ way, with four-game sweeps in both San Francisco and Los Angeles, the Dodgers’ first over the Giants since 1977 and 1995, respectively. That’s fueled a 10-3 mark for the Dodgers against their rivals, and a 37-13 record against the National League West, the latter LA’s best record against the National League West since divisional play began in 1969.\n\nThe Dodgers’ divisional mark to shoot for was the 1974 pennant-winning team, which went 63-27 (.700) against the NL West. To top that this year, the Dodgers need at least 54 divisional wins. Twenty six of the Dodgers’ final 29 games are within the division, with 17 wins needed to set a new club record.\nSan Francisco after sweeping the Dodgers from June 10-12 was in a wild card position in a bunched-up National League, but since then is just 31-42 (.425), which dropped the Giants briefly into fourth place last week before sweeping the Phillies vaulted San Francisco back into third.\nUsing Ryan Pepiot for a spot start Sunday pushed the Dodgers starting rotation back a day, with all three starters this series pitching on five days rest. But it also taxed the bullpen with Pepiot needing 74 pitches to record only six outs, forcing seven relievers to account for the other seven innings.\nFor the Giants, old friend Alex Wood was placed on the injured list with a left shoulder impingement, possibly ending his season. He was scheduled to start Tuesday night, but as of now that is to be determined for San Francisco, with a bullpen game possible, even likely.\nDodgers-Giants pitching matchups\nMonday: Andrew Heaney vs. Logan Webb7:10 p.m., SportsNet LA\nTuesday: Tyler Anderson vs. TBD7:10 p.m., SportsNet LA, MLB Network\nWednesday: Clayton Kershaw vs. Alex Cobb1:10 p.m., SportsNet LA, MLB Network",

        "link": "https://www.fishstripes.com/23314475/2022-marlins-season-review-anthony-bender",
        "description": "Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Evaluating the ups and downs of Anthony Bender’s sophomore year. It was mostly a lost year for Anthony Bender, and the nature of his season-ending injury will impact him for much of 2023, too. Even so, he gave us something to be intrigued about.\n\n2022 Timeline\n\nApril 8: opened regular season as Marlins closer\nMay 4: lost closer’s job, moved to setup role\nMay 25: placed on 15-day injured list (back stiffness)\nJuly 14: sent on minor league rehab assignment\nJuly 24: transferred to 60-day injured list\nAugust 2: activated from injured list\nAugust 14: placed on 15-day injured list (right elbow strain)\nAugust 20: transferred to 60-day injured list\nAugust 30: underwent Tommy John surgery\n\n  \n        \n  \n\nDuring the preseason, Marlins teammates could not hide their excitement for Anthony Bender. He showed up to Jupiter with boosted fastball velocity and an improved changeup. Coming off a shaky second half to his rookie season, the hope was that these adjustments would re-establish him as a trusty, high-leverage reliever.\nJust like in 2021, Bender made it through the Grapefruit League without surrendering a run. When Dylan Floro—Miami’s incumbent closer—fell behind schedule due to a shoulder issue, that made it a fairly easy call for Don Mattingly to ride with Bender as his ninth-inning guy.\nMattingly would regret that immediately. On Opening Day, Bender came in to preserve a 5-4 lead against his childhood team, the Giants. Leading off the bottom of the ninth, Thairo Estrada tied up the contest by blasting a hanging slider over the left-center field fence. The Giants won the game the next inning.\nBender continued to struggle from there. From the start of the 2022 season through May 18,  he suffered three losses (which doesn’t even include the Opening Day blown save). He allowed baserunners in all but two of his appearances despite mostly being limited to single-inning assignments. During that span, the right-hander was on the short list of MLB’s least valuable pitchers in terms of win probability added; among all Marlins players, only Elieser Hernandez and Avisaíl García had a more negative impact.\nBender’s command was imprecise and his changeup wasn’t making a noticeable difference against left-handed batters. With Floro ready to contribute again, I felt Bender should be sent to the minors in a corresponding move to decompress. As it turns out, Bender was battling an injury of his own: the Marlins placed him on the IL with back stiffness.\nThe rehab process was far more deliberate than originally projected. Although Bender resumed throwing within a few weeks, his absence from the active roster ultimately lasted more than two months (62 team games).\nIn the midst of his sixth August outing, Bender blew out his elbow while throwing a nasty slider. It looked problematic in the moment, and after taking a few days to explore all of his options, he underwent Tommy John surgery on August 30. \n\n\n\n\n\nOn the bright side, during that brief second act of his age-27 campaign, Bender showed promise. He didn’t allow any hits to those opponents. There were measurable changes to his slider. The pitch’s average spin rate had spiked more than 200 revolutions per minute from where it had been in April/May, back to where it was last year before Major League Baseball started checking pitchers for sticky substances. August 2022 included eight of the top 11 slider velocities of Bender’s MLB career.\n  \n        \n  \n\nAs alluded to in the introduction, I’m intrigued.\n\nWill Anthony Bender Be Back?\nFor some teams, it would be difficult to justify a 40-man roster spot for a reliever who is due to miss at least half of the upcoming season, never had much prospect hype, performed inconsistently in the majors prior to getting hurt and was acquired cheaply in the first place. In the Marlins’ case, however, this should be an easy call.\nWhich of Miami’s able-bodied relievers are definitively better than Bender? After trading away Anthony Bass, the answer is none.\nDon’t count on the untouchable version of Bender from early 2021 ever coming back, but there is still enough upside to merit patience from the Marlins front office.",

        "link": "https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/09/05/canadian-manhunt-continues-for-deadly-stabbing-suspects",
        "description": "A manhunt continued Monday for two men suspected of stabbing to death 10 people in an Indigenous community and a nearby town in one of the deadliest mass killings in Canada&#x27;s history.The men are also suspected of injuring 15 people in the series of knife attacks that led the James Smith Cree Nation to declare a state of emergency and shook residents of the nearby village of Weldon.“No one in this town is ever going to sleep again. They’re going to be terrified to open their door,” said Weldon resident Ruby Works, who was close to one of the victims.Police, meanwhile, said a vehicle reportedly carrying the two suspects had been spotted about 335 kilometers (210 miles) south of the communities where the stabbings occurred.Police chief Evan Bray said they believe the suspects are in the provincial capital of Regina.The suspects were identified as Damien Sanderson, 31, and Myles Sanderson, 30. Police wouldn&#x27;t confirm if the two are related and gave few details about them.“It is horrific what has occurred in our province,” said Rhonda Blackmore, assistant commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Saskatchewan, adding there were 13 places where either deceased or injured people were found.Blackmore said some of the victims appear to have been targeted by the suspects, but others appear to have been attacked at random.She couldn’t provide a motive, but the chief of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations gave a statement suggesting the stabbings could be drug-related.The elected leaders of the three communities that make up the James Smith Cree Nation, including the Chakastaypasin Band and the Peter Chapman Band, declared a local state of emergency and opened two emergency operations centers.Chakastaypasin Chief Calvin Sanderson — who apparently is not related to the suspects — said everyone has been affected by the tragic events.“They were our relatives, friends,&quot; Sanderson said of the victims. “It’s pretty horrific.”“This is the destruction we face when harmful illegal drugs invade our communities, and we demand all authorities to take direction from the chiefs and councils and their membership to create safer and healthier communities for our people,” said Chief Bobby Cameron of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations.Among the 10 victims killed was Lana Head, who is the former partner of Michael Brett Burns and the mother of their two daughters.&quot;It’s sick how jail time, drugs and alcohol can destroy many lives,” Burns told the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network. “I’m hurt for all this loss.”Last May, Saskatchewan Crime Stoppers issued a wanted list that included Myles Sanderson, writing that he was “unlawfully at large.”The attack is among the deadliest mass killings in Canadian history. The deadliest gun rampage in the country&#x27;s history happened in 2020, when a man disguised as a police officer shot people in their homes and set fires across the province of Nova Scotia, killing 22 people. A man used a van to kill 10 pedestrians in Toronto in 2019. But mass killings are less common in Canada than in the United States.Deadly mass stabbings are more rare than mass shootings, but have happened around the world. In 2014, 29 people were slashed and stabbed to death at a train station in China’s southwestern city of Kunming. In 2016, a mass stabbing at a facility for the mentally disabled in Sagamihara, Japan, left 19 people dead. A year later, three men killed eight people in a vehicle and stabbing attack at London Bridge.Doreen Lees, an 89-year grandmother from Weldon, said she and her daughter thought they saw one of the suspects when a car came barreling down her street early Sunday as her daughter was having coffee on her deck. Lees said a man approached them and said he was hurt and needed help.But Lees said the man took off and ran after her daughter said she would call for help.“He wouldn’t show his face. He had a big jacket over his face. We asked his name and he kind of mumbled his name twice and we still couldn’t get it,” she said. “He said his face was injured so bad he couldn’t show it.”She said the man was by himself and &quot;kind of a little wobbly.”“I followed him a little ways to see if he was going to be OK. My daughter said, ‘Don’t follow him, get back here.’”Weldon residents have identified one of the victims as Wes Petterson. Ruby Works said the 77-year-old widower was like an uncle to her.“I collapsed and hit the ground. I’ve known him since I was just a little girl,″ she said, describing the moment she heard the news. She said he loved his cats, was proud of his homemade Saskatoon berry jam and frequently helped out his neighbors.“He didn’t do anything. He didn’t deserve this. He was a good, kind hearted man,″ said Works.Weldon resident Robert Rush also described the victim as a gentle, widowed man in his 70s.“He wouldn’t hurt a fly,” he said.Rush said Petterson’s adult grandson was in the basement at the time and phoned police.At the Weldon Christian Tabernacle Church, the congregation began its regular Sunday service by saying a special prayer to the victims and their families.At the James Smith Cree Nation, a convenience store that also serves as a gas station became a gathering place for community members who greeted each other with tears and hugs.A sign on the door said: “Due to safety concerns with our community we will remain closed until further notice.”The search for suspects was carried out as fans descended on Regina for a sold-out annual Labor Day game between the Canadian Football League’s Saskatchewan Roughriders and Winnipeg Blue Bombers.The Regina Police Service said in a news release that with the help of Mounties, it was working on several fronts to locate and arrest the suspects and had “deployed additional resources for public safety throughout the city, including the football game at Mosaic Stadium.″Police began getting calls about stabbings at 5:40 a.m. on Sunday. The alert first issued by Melfort, Saskatchewan, RCMP about 7 a.m. was extended hours later to cover Manitoba and Alberta as the two suspects remained at large.The Saskatchewan Health Authority said multiple patients were being treated at several sites.“A call for additional staff was issued to respond to the influx of casualties,” authority spokeswoman Anne Linemann said in an email.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement he was “shocked and devastated by the horrific attacks.”“As Canadians, we mourn with everyone affected by this tragic violence, and with the people of Saskatchewan,&quot; Trudeau said.",

        "description": "Mary Peltola has been fishing on the Kuskokwim since she was a child.Liz Ruskin/Alaska Public MediaDemocrat Mary Peltola could not wait to get out on the Kuskokwim, the river she grew up on, south of the Yukon and upriver from the Bering Sea.She&#x27;s pulled gillnets full of salmon from this river every summer since she was a child. Subsistence fishing and hunting is a way of life here, even for people with office jobs. This summer, though, Peltola had been away, campaigning for Alaska&#x27;s sole seat in the U.S. House. She finally flew home to Bethel in late August and was itching to get on the water.But a storm was moving through. That was a problem because the main goal of this trip was to capture footage of her on the river, for campaign ads.&quot;It&#x27;s good fishing weather, but it&#x27;s not great filming weather,&quot; she said. &quot;I think there&#x27;s some concern that equipment isn&#x27;t damaged,&quot; she said. So Peltola, wearing a gray blazer and more makeup than she&#x27;s used to, sat back down under the bright lights set up in her living room and took direction from her media consultant and cameraman.&quot;I&#x27;m Mary Peltola and here&#x27;s why I&#x27;m running for Don Young&#x27;s seat in Congress,&quot; she said, over and over, striving for just the right level of energy.With a TV crew and media consultant Martha McKenna of Baltimore, Peltola filmed a TV spot in her Bethel home.Liz Ruskin/Alaska Public MediaShe didn&#x27;t know it then, but she had already won her long-shot campaign to replace the late Congressman Young. After a 15-day waiting period for mailed ballots to arrive in the special election, Peltola learned on Aug. 31 she&#x27;d beaten the most famous Alaskan in history, former Republican Gov. Sarah Palin, in one of the reddest states in the nation. Peltola turned 49 last Wednesday, the same day she became congresswoman-elect of the 49th state. Born Mary Sattler, she&#x27;s the daughter of a Yup&#x27;ik mom and a Nebraskan dad who went north to teach school and later became a Bush pilot. Peltola will be the first Alaska Native in Congress when she&#x27;s sworn in this month to fill the remainder of Young&#x27;s term.Meanwhile, she and Palin are also on the ballot in November, for the next full House term. Whatever the result of the special election, she knew she needed campaign ads. So, when the storm let up, Peltola threw off her blazer and put on bulky layers, topped with rain gear.&quot;Everyone has a float coat?&quot; she called out to the film crew. She began throwing things in her aluminum skiff — buckets, an anchor, life jackets. &quot;Last bit of survival tools and necessities,&quot; she said. &quot;OK. We&#x27;re ready to roll!&quot;Her rivalry with Sarah Palin is more of a love festPeltola went away to college, but at age 24 ran for state House and beat an incumbent. She stayed in office for a decade, overlapping with then-Gov. Palin. They bonded in the state Capitol, as two pregnant moms in office. When Palin left Juneau for the campaign trail, Peltola said, she bequeathed her backyard trampoline to Peltola.Palin didn&#x27;t respond to interview requests. She vilifies Democrats in general. After Peltola&#x27;s win Wednesday, Palin called on Begich — the other Republican in the race — to &quot;take the loss like a real Alaskan man&quot; and withdraw from the November election. But Palin calls Peltola a &quot;sweetheart&quot; and says she&#x27;s admirable.The lack of rivalry goes both ways.&quot;I think she&#x27;s great,&quot; Peltola said.That politeness is on-brand for her. In the Legislature, Peltola was known for uncommon kindness.&quot;She was never bitter. She was never angry. She was never partisan,&quot; Andrew Halcro said. He and Peltola were freshman legislators in 1999. (Also new in the state House that year: Lisa Murkowski, now Alaska&#x27;s senior U.S. senator. She speaks highly of Peltola, too.) A White Republican who represented a relatively wealthy Anchorage district, Halcro ignited statewide fury with a speech he now regrets. He likened Bush residents to children who don&#x27;t learn to tie their laces because the state keeps sending Velcro shoes.A lot of Alaskans wrote Halcro off as a racist.But within hours, he said, Peltola was at his office door, asking if she could offer a different perspective on Power Cost Equalization, the rural energy subsidy he had derided. He came to see the program as she does, as a matter of equity for regions that didn&#x27;t benefit from expensive hydroelectric projects the state funded.&quot;I think with Mary Peltola, you should never, ever misconstrue kindness for somebody who&#x27;s not going to stand up for what she believes in,&quot; Halcro said.Bev Hoffman of Bethel has known Peltola her whole life.&quot;She is nice. But she is so tough,&quot; Hoffman said with admiration.They fought together on fish issues, and to get a swimming pool for Bethel, where drownings were common because few people learned to swim. They were at odds for six years, when Peltola worked as manager of sustainability for Donlin Gold, a mine project Peltola no longer supports.Bev Hoffman says Peltola is no pushover: &quot;She is nice. But she is so tough.&quot;Liz Ruskin/Alaska Public MediaHoffman said Peltola has a way of listening intently and drawing people of opposing views together. &quot;She doesn&#x27;t yell at people,&quot; Hoffman said.Peltola said yelling isn&#x27;t effective. She credits her upbringing and her mentors for her political style. &quot;The region where I&#x27;m from, there is a big premium on being respectful, on not using inflammatory language or harsh tones,&quot; she said.Peltola believes in the power of small gestures. She said she once defused an urban Republican legislator, just by pointing out that he — being decades her senior — had lived more years in Alaska than she had. She said they got on great after that, and to her, that&#x27;s good politics.Fighting for salmon is Peltola&#x27;s causeBack on the river, Peltola was facing a cumbersome mission — driving a boat through the braids of the Kuskokwim with the weight of extra visitors, accommodating microphones and providing good angles for the camera. There&#x27;s a more serious problem with this fishing trip: There are no fish. The Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta is suffering another year of dismal salmon returns.&quot;Growing up, and until probably 2010, our greatest fear was that we&#x27;d catch too many fish,&quot; Peltola said, adding that 70 salmon a day is the maximum she and her husband can comfortably cut and clean. &quot;Now, our greatest fear is that we won&#x27;t catch single-digit numbers of fish.&quot;King salmon used to be the mainstay of the diet here. When those populations plunged, people made do with the smaller chum salmon and then filled in with August silvers if they didn&#x27;t catch enough to last the winter. This year, for the first time, even silvers did not return in sufficient numbers. The Kuskokwim was closed to all forms of fishing.This is a tragedy beyond words for this salmon-based region. Peltola has spent the past five years of her career on it, as director of the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission. Protecting salmon is a major campaign theme. &quot;Yeah, this is kind of the center of my universe,&quot; she said, at the mouth of a tributary called the Gweek. &quot;Just because my uncles taught me exactly where to put the net to catch certain kinds of fish.&quot;She pointed out the bank on the left where her great-grandparents lived, outside of any village, until the government said they had to enroll their daughter in school. &quot;My mom was born over here, in Tabungaluk Slough,&quot; she said, pointing across to the right. &quot;It was August and berry-picking time, so this is where she was born.&quot;A camera crew documents Mary Peltola fishing for a campaign ad.Liz Ruskin/Alaska Public MediaScientists aren&#x27;t sure why the salmon aren&#x27;t returning to this river. Climate change and ocean acidification are factors. Peltola also attributes it to the thousands of salmon caught by accident at sea, by trawlers targeting pollock.(The At-Sea Processors Association, which represents some of the largest factory trawlers, says it&#x27;s taking steps to limit bycatch, but says larger factors are to blame.)Non-salmon producing tributaries of the Kuskokwim are open to fishing. So, primarily for the camera, Peltola leaned over the bow and fed a small set net into the water. Sometimes salmon make a wrong turn. But when reeled the net back into the boat later, it was empty.\n&quot;I stay hopeful right until the end, because sometimes you get lucky, right at the end meshes,&quot; she said.\nCopyright 2022 Alaska Public Media.

        "description": "David Banks-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Bobby Witt Jr. joins the 20/20/ club. With his 20th home run, Bobby Witt Jr. became the fifth first-year player to reach the 20/20 club.\n\n“I don’t think he should be [overshadowed], and I don’t know what we’re doing or not doing. We’re working on it, right? We’ll figure it out,” manager Mike Matheny said. “Everybody sees how special [he is]. We watch him day in and day out. Our fan base sees it; we’re just trying to get him a little more recognition on the national level because what he’s doing is extremely impressive.\n“He still needs to be in the [Rookie of the Year] conversation with what he’s doing and how he’s playing the game.”\n\nMichael Massey continues to impress at the plate.\n“I think there’s this false narrative out there in the world where you’re supposed to have confidence before you do something,” Massey said. “And I think that that’s a really interesting thing that the world has put out there because I believe, honestly, the more experience I get, the more confidence I have at it, and so they kind of come together.”\nDaniel Lynch had four good innings on Saturday, then one not-so-good inning.\n“I just want to keep getting better,” he said. “I understand that I’m still young and this is still a new thing, but I’m pretty demanding on myself. And so I want to make sure that … I’m using that time to one, give the team a chance to win, and two, just continue to improve as much as I can.”\nSam Lutz at Pitcher’s List looks at whether Brady Singer is an ace.\n\nIn 2021, Singer’s walk rate sat just above the league’s bottom third, and this year that same rate sits just a single percentage point outside the top quarter of MLB pitchers. On the other hand, it is both noteworthy and surprising to see his hard hit rate, barrel percentage, and average exit velocity allowed all increase so much. After allowing league-average exit velocity, and better than average barrels over his first couple of seasons, Singer has seen batters barrel him up roughly one-third more often than league average. His hard hit percentage has also ballooned and sits at a rate about 20 percent worse than average.\nThankfully, Singer induces grounders on 47% of the balls that hitters put into play, which beats the league average of 44.9, and helps explain why his expected batting average against of .232 and BABIP of .291 both beat the league at large which sit at .245 and .291 respectively. It also helps that his CSW% continues to sit comfortably above the MLB average rate.\n\nKevin O’Brien at Royals Reporter wants to consider a long-term deal with Nick Pratto.\n\nWill Pratto be a superstar like Bobby or MJ? Probably not. But for a small market team like the Royals, it is a priority to identify regular players who can have an impact at an affordable level for a good period of time. That’s easier to do from within an organization’s farm system rather than free agency, where the prices of such players inflates, due to competing demand for such players from other organizations.\nThe Royals and Royals fans will figure out a long-term financial plan for Bobby and MJ (and probably Vinnie) soon.\nBut the Royals should lock down Pratto sooner rather than later.\n\nVinnie Pasquantino began a rehab assignment with Omaha.\nFernando Cruz, drafted by the Royals as an infielder in 2007, finally makes the big leagues as a pitcher with the Reds at age 32.\nWhite Sox pitcher Dylan Cease has a no-hit bid broken up with two outs in the ninth.\nThe Red Sox call up top prospect Triston Casas.\nAaron Judge hits home run #53.\nMax Scherzer leaves his start early with fatigue.\nThe Rangers designate veteran Dallas Keuchel for assignment after two starts.\nWill anyone make a run at 700 career home runs?\nA sexual abuse case against former All-Star reliever John Wetteland ends in a mistrial.\nMLB is overdue to field a female umpire, but Jen Pawol may be on the rise.\nNetflix teases a Johnny Manziel documentary.\nThe most interesting storylines in college football this year.\nScientists finally understand a climate anomaly in the southeastern U.S.\nThe best tennis scenes in movies, ranked.\nHow did Labor Day begin as a federal holiday?\nYour song of the day is Coolio with 1,2,3,4 (Sumpin’ New).",

It's interesting because of the summaries of four possible futures of the metaverse: the free 'verse, the nerd, The disunited or one Metaverse to rule them all. The article projects some version of the latter two. \"The open-source community has fallen on hard times because authorities demand governance and certification that the decentralised open-source organisations find it difficult to live up to, such as checking all content against copyright and trademark violations and policing forums against hate speech and fake news. Most successful open-source systems have been de-facto acquired by commercial interests that can afford to handle the complex and extensive regulations.\" I find this a very interesting assertion.\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

        "description": "Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Mets will look to bounce back from an embarrassing series loss to the Nationals. The Mets (85-50) head to one of baseball’s most beautiful ballparks as they square off with the Pirates (49-84) for three games. The Mets dropped four of seven to the Pirates last year, when they played them seven games in a row (four at Citi Field before the All Star break, three at PNC Park immediately after the All Star break). \nWith the Mets heading into the softest part of their schedule—they have the easiest schedule, record-wise, from here on out—the Mets got off on the wrong foot by dropping two of three against the last-place Nationals. On Friday, New York found themselves in a close game late, but a four-run sixth inning led to a 7-3 victory. Eduardo Escobar got Dollars 4 Dingers off to a roaring start with a two-run homer, and the Mets built a 3-1 lead before Washington tied it up. Pete Alonso put the Mets back in front with a solo homer, and New York added three more runs from there to secure the victory.\nThe Mets had a bad time on Saturday in a 7-1 loss. Max Scherzer was once again deprived of his 100th career win, though it wasn’t his fault. He was great for five innings—all he really gave up was a Luis García solo dinger in the firstbut exited after 67 pitches due to fatigue on his left side—he swears it was precautionary and hopes to make his next start in Miami. The Mets’ offense could do just about nothing against the worst version of Patrick Corbin, managing just one run—an Escobar homer, again—on three measly hits against the left-hander. Things remained knotted up at one until the eighth, when Adam Ottavino surrendered a solo home run to Lane Thomas to break the tie. Adonis Medina proceeded to put the game well out of reach by having a meltdown ninth inning in his return to the bigs after getting named a September call-up.\nThe Mets dropped the rubber match by an identical 7-1 score on Sunday. Once again, the offense did nothing against a bad pitcher—it was Corbin on Saturday, and Erick Fedde on Sunday—while Carlos Carrasco was not effective in his return from the IL. The less we say about this game, the better, as there were no positives to take from it.\nThe Pirates enter this game on a four-game losing streak. That started when they dropped the rubber match of their series to the Brewers, and continued when they were swept by the Blue Jays over the weekend.\nPittsburgh enters play today with the lowest wRC+ (80) and OPS (.646) in the National League. Meanwhile, their rotation sports a 4.76 ERA (fourth-worst in the NL) and a 4.33 FIP (fifth-worst in the NL). Their bullpen hasn’t been much better, pitching to a 4.61 ERA, which is the third-worst mark in the NL, despite featuring All Star closer David Bednar. Ke’Bryan Hayes is the player to watch on the Pirates, leading the club with a 2.3 fWAR while hitting .242/.311/.346 with an 86 wRC+ in 112 games. Bryan Reynolds, who was not traded at the deadline and remains a Pirate, is hitting .253/.334/.451 with a team-leading 21 homers, 48 runs batted in, and 58 runs scored in a team-high 116 games. He has a 1.8 fWAR while leading Pittsburgh with a 118 wRC+.\nMonday, September 5: Taijuan Walker vs. Mitch Keller, 12:35 p.m. on SNY\nWalker (2022): 122.2 IP, 93 K, 38 BB, 10 HR, 3.45 ERA, 3.74 FIP, 1.22 WHIP, 2.2 bWAR\nIn his second start since returning from back spasms, Walker held his own against a tough Dodgers lineup. He went 5 1⁄3 innings and allowed three earned runs on five hits. He struck out five and walked three and was left with a no-decision. Walker’s last few starts this season will be crucial for two reasons: The right-hander is playing for his next contract, and also playing for his spot in the team’s postseason rotation beyond the big three. Presumably, the decision will come down to Walker or Carlos Carrasco getting the fourth spot when the team needs one.\nKeller (2022): 124.0 IP, 107 K, 46 BB, 12 HR, 4.43 ERA, 3.93 FIP, 1.46 WHIP, 0.6 bWAR\nKeller, who was drafted in the second round of the 2014 MLB draft by Pittsburgh, has already surpassed his career high in innings pitched (124.0) and appearances (25) in his fourth season. The right-hander is also coming off one of the best starts of his season, going 6.0 innings and limiting Milwaukee to two earned runs on four hits. He walked two and struck out a season-high ten. The outing comes after he allowed seven runs (two earned) on seven hits in 3 2⁄3 innings against the Braves his last time out.\nTuesday, September 6: Jacob deGrom vs. Bryse Wilson, 6:35 p.m. on SNY\ndeGrom (2022): 36.1 IP, 55 K, 3 BB, 3 HR, 1.98 ERA, 1.42 FIP, 0.55 WHIP, 1.4 bWAR\ndeGrom was dominant against a tough Dodgers team, hurling 7.0 innings and limiting Los Angeles to one run on three hits. That run came off the bat of Mookie Betts on a solo home run in the sixth, but the Mets’ two runs helped earn him the victory. If was the third straight start that the right-hander struck out nine, giving him 55 punch outs against just three walks. The ace will get an extra day of rest between starts as a result of Carrasco’s return, so he should conceivably be under no restrictions this time around, especially since he has now thrown 90-plus pitches in two of his last three starts.\nWilson (2022): 82.1 IP, 55 K, 22 BB, 15 HR, 6.12 ERA, 5.14 FIP, 1.52 WHIP, -1.3 bWAR\nWilson was originally drafted by Atlanta in the fourth round of the 2016 MLB Draft, but he never put it together for the Braves and was eventually shipped to the Pirates last season for Richard Rodriguez. He hasn’t done much better for his new team, and has really struggled this year for the Pirates. In his last start against the Brewers, he was tagged for three earned runs on five hits, with two walks and two strikeouts over 3.0 innings. Before that, the right-hander was charged with four runs (three earned) on five hits while lasting just 1.0 inning.\nWednesday, September 7: Chris Bassitt vs. Johan Oviedo, 6:35 p.m. on SNY\nChris Bassitt (2022): 154.1 IP, 143 K, 40 BB, 15 HR, 3.32 ERA, 3.52 FIP, 1.15 WHIP, 3.0 bWAR\nBassitt had a strong start against L.A., going 6.0 innings and allowing two earned runs to pick up his 12th win as a Met. He gave up six hits in the outing, while striking out four and walking three—the latter was his most free passes issued since he walked four on July 29. Since the start of August, Bassitt has pitched to a 1.83 ERA, a 2.71 FIP, and a 1.19 WHIP in 39 1⁄3 innings across six starts.\nOviedo (2022): 28.1 IP, 30 K, 10 BB, 4 HR, 2.86 ERA, 4.00 FIP, 1.34 WHIP, 0.5 bWAR\nOviedo started his career with the Cardinals in 2020 and pitched in parts of the last three seasons for St. Louis before heading to the Pirates in the Jose Quintana/Chris Stratton trade earlier this year. He made just one start against 13 relief appearances for the Cardinals this year, pitching to a 3.20 ERA and 4.07 FIP in 25 1⁄3 innings. He has made one start for the PIrates so far, shutting out the Blue Jays on two hits while walking three and striking out four batters over 3.0 innings.\nPrediction: The Mets take two of three from the Pirates.",

        "description": "All-Star outfielder for Brooklyn during World War II On this Labor Day edition of Leading Off with True Blue LA, we look back at former Dodgers outfielder Goody Rosen, a man who understood the value of his work.\nRosen played five years for the minor league Louisville Colonels before getting called up to the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1937, becoming the first Canadian-born Jewish player in major league history. He had a hot start that September, with multi-hit games in each of his first four starts, and was 10 for 20 to begin his career.\nHe was a regular for the Dodgers in 1938, playing all three outfield positions, but slumped under first-year manager Leo Durocher in 1939 and got sent to the minors. After that season, Rosen sent his contract back to Dodgers general manager Larry McPhail unsigned, a strategy that never brought endearment, especially in the age of the reserve clause.\nRosen was sold to the Pirates, then to the Reds, and after four years in the minors made his way back to the Dodgers in 1944. Rosen was of slight build, listed at 5’9, 160 pounds, and didn’t have much power. But coach Charlie Dressen, who would later manage the Dodgers, helped Rosen with his swing, and helped unlock his best season in 1945.\nRosen that year hit .325/.379/.460, a 134 OPS+ with 24 doubles, 11 triples, and 12 home runs, finishing in the top-10 in the National League in WAR, batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage, hits, total bases, triples, OPS+, and his 129 runs scored ranked second in the league.\nDuring a hot streak in 1945, Rosen referred to the price the Dodgers paid for him both times they acquired him, telling the Brownsville Herald, “Do you know that I’m really a $40,000 player as far as Brooklyn is concerned? The Dodgers bought me for $20,000 late in 1937, then [in 1944] paid Syracuse another $20,000 for my contract.”\nCome salary time before the 1946 season, Rosen thought he should be paid more to reflect his worth, but all that got him was traded, by Branch Rickey to the Giants a few games into the season.\nRosen hit .333/.500/.524 for the Giants in 16 games against the Dodgers that season, including five hits in a doubleheader sweep of Brooklyn in his first two games with the team.\n\nRelated reading\n\nRosen’s SABR bio, written by Alex Tepperman\n\nRosen at the Jewish Baseball Museum\n\n\nTwitter thread on Rosen from Kevin Glew, in which one of the replies includes Rosen’s obituary from 1994 in Toronto\n\nPodcast links\nWays to listen\nRSS feed\nEpisode link (time: 21:09)",

        "description": "Once in a while you come across something 100% deliciousOccasionally, some restraint is called for. When I need to recalibrate both my taste buds and my insulin levels, I restrict myself to very dark chocolate. Preferably 90% and over, but with some over 80%s getting a look-in. I stop short of almost all 100% though as that, to me, is self-harming by chocolate. Although: see later.Sticking to 80%+ quells the calorie consumption – it is virtually impossible to gorge on very dark chocolate – and gives me a new appreciation for the cocoa bean. There will be quite a heavy sprinkle of 80%+ mentions in the coming weeks.

        "description": "Photo Credit: Garrett Spain\n    \n\n  Only two games were able to be played Sunday evening, though one of these gave us a stellar outing from Cedric de Grandpre A rainy Sunday in the southeast impacted every game in the Atlanta Braves system, with three of the five scheduled contests being unplayable. Of the other two, Mississippi’s loss was cut short after six innings and Augusta experienced a lengthy delay before their match with the Salem Red Sox.\n(61-67) Gwinnett Stripers, (69-59) Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp CANCELLED\nNext Game: 9/6 @ (66-62) Buffalo Bisons @ 6:05 PM ET\n\n(57-67) Mississippi Braves 2, (67-58) Tennessee Smokies 5\nBox Score\n\nCody Milligan, CF: 2-2, BB .295/.364/.335\nJavier Valdez, DH: 1-3, .269/.441/.442\nJustyn-Henry Malloy, LF: 0-3, .280/.399/.447\nNolan Kingham, SP:  5 IP, 8 H, 5 R, 5 ER, 2 BB, 4 K, 5.63 ERA\nColeman Huntley, RP: 1 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K, 3.51 ERA\n\nMississippi fell into a big hole early in this game and by the time they seemed ready to climb out of it Mother Nature decided to cut their comeback effort short. After falling down 3-0 in the top of the first inning Mississippi managed to chip back immediately as Cody Milligan led off in the bottom of the first with a walk and scored on a Jalen Miller double. Unfortunately for Mississippi the next two hitters struck out, stranding Miller at third base and keeping this game at a two run margin. Mississippi had runners on in each of the next four innings, but couldn’t string together any sort of rally. When Tennessee dropped a two spot on their heads in the fifth inning the deficit doubled and the Braves faced a 5-1 hole going into the sixth inning. The Braves got Drew Lugbauer and Javier Valdes on base but after a Cade Bunnell sacrifice fly cut the margin to three runs a pop up shower sent the game into a delay. Eventually it was decided to call the game and the series, leaving the second game of this double header cancelled.\nNolan Kingham’s outing was especially marred in the early going, with a three run home run immediately inflating his ERA. After that home run Kingham pitched solid ball with three scoreless innings and two hits allowed, but the fifth inning was one too long and led to further problems. The first three batters of the inning got hits off of Kingham and Tennessee brought home two runs in the inning to make the lead 5-0. Coleman Huntley pitched the one relief inning in this game, flinging a perfect sixth inning with two strikeouts. \n(57-67) Mississippi Braves, (67-58) Tennessee Smokies  CANCELLED\n\nNext Game: 9/6 @ (58-65) Biloxi Shuckers @ 7:35 PM ET\n\n(70-53) Rome Braves, (49-75) Greenville Drive  POSTPONED\nNext Game: 9/6 @ (65-61) Hickory Crawdads @ 7:00 PM ET\n\n(65-60) Augusta GreenJackets , (63-62) Salem Red Sox \nBox Score\n\nEthan Workinger, LF: 3-4, 2B, 4 RBI, .333/.538/.556\nIgnacio Alvarez Jr., SS: 1-3, 2 BB, RBI, .429/.487/.629\nKevin Kilpatrick Jr., RF: 1-4, 2B, BB, .273/.311/.364\nCedric De Grandpre, SP: 3.2 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 5 K, 11.25 ERA\nBlake Burkhalter, RP: 1.1 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K, 0.00 ERA\n\nAugusta made it rain on Sunday evening, riding big innings to a win over the Red Sox. After an hour long rain delay both offenses had trouble getting heated up and through three were locked in a scoreless battle. That changed in the fourth inning when Justin Janas led off a rally with a base hit. While Janas had to leave due to an apparent injury pinch runner Mahki Backstrom scored the go ahead run on a single from EJ Exposito. Francisco Floyd followed with a sacrifice fly to put Augusta up 2-0. This lead would not hold as the Augusta bullpen surrendered four runs, however the offense was far from finished in this one. Salem walked the bases loaded with no outs in the sixth inning and then forced home a run on a wild pitch. This set up a go-ahead single from Ethan Workinger that put Augusta up 5-4. Augusta broke it open in the seventh inning and they were once again led by Kevin Kilpatrick Jr. and Nacho Alvarez. Kilpatrick doubled with one out in the inning which set up Alvarez for an RBI single to make it 6-4. Drake Baldwin got Alvarez over to third base with a single and a wild pitch scored him to make it 7-4. Workinger drove in his third and fourth runs of the game on a two run double that put the game effectively out of reach.\nCedric De Grandpre came into this outing looking to put a rough debut behind him and he did just that with a phenomenal performance. De Grandpre retired the first nine batters he faced in the game and struck out four of those. He got into trouble when the first two hitters of the fourth inning netted hits against him, but Workinger came through again with an outfield assist to cut down the runner trying to score. De Grandpre struck out the last batter he faced then turned the ball over to the bullpen. Malcolm Van Buren had quite the struggled and left the bases loaded with two outs in the fifth inning and a run in. Blake Burkhalter made his full season debut to try to finish out the inning and was promptly greeted with a bases clearing double that gave Salem a lead. Burkhalter pitched a scoreless sixth inning and notched his first Augusta strikeout. James Acuna covered scoreless innings in the seventh and eighth but he wasn’t able to escape in the ninth before making it a save situation. Rob Griswold came in to clean up him mess, and although the Red Sox did score two runs in the inning he was able to close out a win.\nNext Game: 9/6 @ (56-70) Kannapolis Cannonballers @ 7:00 PM ET",

        "description": "Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Camden Yards is the venue for a crucial matchup between AL East foes vying for the same playoff spot. Rooting for a competitive team is exhausting. Every single game feels like it possesses the power to shift a season’s worth of momentum and either propel the team to postseason glory or tank all of their magic in one fell swoop. That feeling will get ratcheted up to 11 for four games as the Orioles welcome the Blue Jays to Camden Yards for what could be a season-deciding series.\nThat is not hyberbole. The O’s and Jays are competing for the final wild card spot in the AL. As of this writing, the Orioles are 2.5 games back. As much as a four-game swing in either direction is on the line here. It is fair to say that the season could hang in the balance.\nIt should be said that these two teams still have two series (six games total) against one another this season: next weekend in Toronto, and then the final three games of the season back at Camden Yards. Nothing will be settled this week, but it’s still of utmost importance.\nThe Orioles have a 6-3 record against the Blue Jays this season. That’s significant as head-to-head record is the first tiebreaker should the two teams finish with identical records. They will want to ensure they grab that tiebreak as they have already lost it with several other clubs (Twins, Mariners, Rays, Yankees) that are vying for playoff spots. They need to have a leg up on someone.\nIn the 16 games since the Blue Jays last saw the Orioles, the team up north has gone 11-5, taking advantage of a rather weak section of their schedule. The only winning team they have faced since was the Yankees, who have been in the midst of a well-documented slump for well over a month. A sweep over the Pirates was their most recent conquest.\nToronto has started to get healthy. They have a few pitchers that could be nearing a return from the 60-day IL: Nate Pearson, Julian Merryweather, and Tayler Saucedo. The closest to coming back is Merryweather. The hard-throwing reliever was on the team’s taxi squad this past weekend; perhaps he joins up as the 29th-man for Monday’s doubleheader.\nGame 1: Monday, September 5th, 1:05 p.m., MASN &amp; MLB Network\nRHP Jordan Lyles (10-9, 4.25 ERA) vs. RHP Kevin Gausman (10-9, 3.14 ERA)\nThe inning snacker himself, Jordan Lyles, opens the series. The veteran was tremendous in August, compiling a 3.18 ERA over 34 frames. His final start, a scoreless 6.2 innings, was the cherry on top. This will be his third time facing the Blue Jays in 2022. Back in June he allowed four runs over 5.1 innings, and last month it was two runs over 5.2 innings.\nKevin Gausman faces his former club for the second time this season. He struggled in the first matchup, serving up five earned runs (seven runs total) in just 2.1 innings of work. At the time, the righty blamed fatigue and said he was disappointed: \n“It’s embarrassing, to be honest, to go out there and do that against a team that I think we should beat. It may sound bad to say, but I think we should beat them more than we should lose to them.\nFortunately for Kevin, all of his teammates have experienced that embarrassment of losing to the Orioles at least six times this season.\nGame 2: Monday, September 5th, TBD, MASN\nRHP Mike Baumann (1-2, 4.50 ERA) vs. RHP Josè Berríos (9-5, 5.32 ERA)\nMike Baumann will get added as the 29th man for this game. It’s an important appearance for the 26-year-old. The organization seems to have tried making him a full-time reliever this year, but it has not gone well. On the other hand, in the nine games he has started for Triple-A Norfolk this year Baumann has a 2.79 ERA, striking out 53 across 38.2 innings. \nAugust was another tough month for José Berríos. The high-priced righty struggled to miss bats as opposing hitters had a .912 OPS against in the month. It was more of the same in a nightmare season for the 28-year-old. This will be his second start against the Orioles this season.\nGame 3: Tuesday, September 6th, 7:05 p.m., MASN\nRHP Kyle Bradish (3-5, 5.17 ERA) vs. RHP Mitch White (1-5, 4.67 ERA)\nThe rookie Kyle Bradish is on a hot streak. The 25-year-old has not allowed a run over his last two starts, which have spanned 15 innings and came against two playoff contenders (Astros, Guardians). He has looked like a different pitcher since returning from the IL: seven starts, 40.2 innings, 2.66 ERA, .216 batting average against, 38 strikeouts, 14 walks.\nMitch White was a trade deadline acquisition from the Dodgers. Through five starts it has not proven to be a prudent move. The righty has a 7.04 ERA in a Blue Jays uniform, but that is weighted heavily towards his last two starts in which he allowed 13 runs over 9.2 innings against the Angels and Cubs.\nGame 4: Wednesday, September 7th, 7:05 p.m., MASN\n RHP Dean Kremer (6-4, 3.22 ERA) vs. RHP Alek Manoah (13-7, 2.48 ERA)\nIs Dean Kremer good now? It sure feels like it. The former Dodgers prospect just continues to shove every single time he goes out to the mound, particularly in his last four starts. In that time Kremer has allowed just six runs and one home run over 26 innings. \nAlek Manoah is a Cy Young contender, but he has cooled since a red hot start to season. His 1.44 ERA in April has slowed to a more pedestrian 3.39 ERA between July and August. But don’t you worry, he can still dominant a lineup, as he did over the weekend when he shutout the Pirates for 7.1 innings. The Orioles have faced Manoah three times already this season and come out as the winners on two of those occasions. A winning strategy in the most recent game was patience, pushing up Manoah’s pitch count, working four walks, and getting him on the bench before the end of the sixth inning.",

        "description": "In August 2022, Python inched closer to the 3.11 release, pandas introduced enhancement proposals, various packages saw new releases, Python extended its lead at the top of the TIOBE index, and PyPI battled malware.\nRead on for more details about what happened in the world of Python in August 2022!\nJoin Now: Click here to join the Real Python Newsletter and you'll never miss another Python tutorial, course update, or post.\n\nPython Has PEPs, NumPy Has NEPs, pandas Now Has PDEPs\nThe first pandas enhancement proposal (PDEP) was submitted on August 3, 2022, and was entitled Purpose and guidelines. Enhancement proposals aren’t new to the Python community. Python has had PEPs since 2000, and NumPy followed with NEPs in 2017.\nThe first PDEP follows in the tradition of PEPs and NEPs, with PDEP-1 being an introduction to the idea behind the enhancement proposals themselves.\nIn a nutshell, PDEPs are intended to aid the proposal process for major changes to pandas, such as moving a module from the main pandas repository to a break-off repository. PDEPs are not for quick fixes, but for major undertakings that involve the wider community and, more often than not, some significant trade-offs.\nWorking out complex issues isn’t ideally suited to a thread-based medium, like GitHub issues. It can be hard for a discussion to stay focused if anyone can respond at any time, even if the original idea is a good one.\nGitHub issue threads can create noise not only for the core developers, but for contributors and end users too. Additionally, they can bury good but complex ideas by not providing an appropriate medium for discussing them. Contributor h-vetinari raised this topic in a GitHub issue in 2019:\n\nThe more intricate the API implications, the harder it is to discuss in GitHub comments (because there is usually too many things to consider at the same time, or the comments/threads get ridiculously long or both). That does not mean that the given change does not have merit though, just that it’s (likely) too hard to discuss in a thread format. (Source)\n\nThe GitHub issue that h-vetinari raised three years ago has now been closed with the pull request for PDEP-1. This may lay a blueprint for the PDEP life cycle going forward. PDEPs will probably get started when someone creates an issue. If the issue is recognized as being significant and valuable, then the person who raised it may be directed to create a PDEP.\nThis move to PDEPs means that the roadmap that’s typically used for communicating larger changes to pandas will slowly migrate toward PDEPs.\nHow do you feel about the move to PDEPs? Share your thoughts in the comments!\nPython Ecosystem Celebrates New Releases\nThe Python community didn’t rest throughout August, even though it’s typically a month for vacations. As usual, there have been plenty of releases in the Python ecosystem. From CPython to CircuitPython, there are plenty of new features for you to start playing with. Read on for a selection of releases and milestones.\nCPython\nThe CPython team is still gearing up for the release of Python 3.11 in October 2022. If you’re interested in learning more about the 3.11 release, check out some in-depth Real Python tutorials exploring the new 3.11 features, such as exception groups, tomllib, and better error messages.\nRead the full article at https://realpython.com/python-news-august-2022/ »\n        \n        [ Improve Your Python With 🐍 Python Tricks 💌 – Get a short &amp; sweet Python Trick delivered to your inbox every couple of days. &gt;&gt; Click here to learn more and see examples ]",

        "description": "Photo by Meg Oliphant/Getty Images\n    \n\n  A little Astros baseball and some bbq sounds like a fine plan today Happy Labor Day from The Crawfish Boxes!\nAs we celebrate the accomplishments of workers across this great country, it’s important to remember that things don’t come free.  All the little things we enjoy as a society are built on the strength of those willing to roll their sleeves up and get to work.  Whether they do it to contribute or simply to provide for their own family, American workers have helped to build one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and we should all be grateful.\nPersonally, I’ll be showing my gratitude by having a few brews, listening to the Astros play, and hanging out with my family while barbequing this afternoon.  I hope that everyone reading this has similar plans this afternoon as they take their leisure on this holiday.\nAs for the Astros, well, not much time for rest when one is headed for the postseason.  They return home this afternoon to take on the Texas Rangers one last time this season, a team that Houston has owned over the course of the past several years.  While I don’t have time for a full preview this morning, you can read the one I did the last time the Astros faced Arlington here.  Since that was only last week, not much as changed in the interim.\nOffensive Stats: YTD, Last 7 Days\nPitching Stats: YTD, Last 7 Days\nLast 10 Games: 2-8 Record, 1 Series Loss, 2 Series Swept, -15 Run Differential (52 scored, 67 allowed)\nW/L Splits: 28-38 at home, 30-37 on the road, 29-46 against teams over .500\n\n\n\nStarters\nGame 1: Martin Perez (LHP, 10-5, 2.89 ERA, 144 K’s) vs Hunter Brown (RHP, 0-0, -.— ERA, 0 K’s)\nGame 2: Glenn Otto (RHP, 6-8, 4.82 ERA, 82 K’s) vs Framber Valdez (LHP, 14-4, 2.63 ERA, 150 K’s)\nGame 3: TBD vs Cristian Javier (RHP, 8-9, 3.07 ERA, 157 K’s)\nFor Your Viewing and Listening Pleasure\nGame 1: Monday, September 5th @ 6:10 pm CDTListen: Rangers - KFLC 1270, 105.3 The Fan, KRLD 1080 / Astros - KBME 790 AM/94.5 FM HD-2, KTRH 740 AM/99.1 FM HD-2, TUDN 93.3/KLAT 1010Watch: Rangers - Bally Sports Southwest / Astros - ATT SportsNet-SW / MLB Network (out-of-market only)\nGame 2: Tuesday, September 6th @ 7:10 pm CDTListen: Rangers - KFLC 1270, 105.3 The Fan, KRLD 1080 / Astros - KBME 790 AM/94.5 FM HD-2, KTRH 740 AM/99.1 FM HD-2, TUDN 93.3/KLAT 1010Watch: Rangers - Bally Sports Southwest / Astros - ATT SportsNet-SW\nGame 3: Wednesday, September 7th @ 7:10 pm CDTListen: Rangers - KFLC 1270, 105.3 The Fan, KRLD 1080 / Astros - KBME 790 AM/94.5 FM HD-2, KTRH 740 AM/99.1 FM HD-2, TUDN 93.3/KLAT 1010Watch: Rangers - Bally Sports Southwest / Astros - ATT SportsNet-SW",

Chris Fabricant, director of strategic litigation for the Innocence Project and the author of Junk Science and the American Criminal Justice System (Akashic Books, 2022), talks about cases in which forensic \"science\" led to wrongful convictions and tries to push back on the idea (from shows like CSI) that forensics takes human error out of the equation.\nSarah Larson, a staff writer for The New Yorker, talks about her reporting on pickleball, known for its friendly competition, as it deals with the growing pains of its exploding popularity.\nFrancis Fukuyama, senior fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, former State Deparment official and the author of The End of History and the Last Man (Free Press, 1992) and his latest, Liberalism and Its Discontents (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2022), reflects on the state of liberal democracy which he had seemed ascendant in the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War and offers a critique of the current state of liberalism.\nSteve Zeitlin, founding director of CityLore and author of The Poetry of Everyday Life: Storytelling and the Art of Awareness (Cornell University Press, 2016), and Bob Holman, poet, filmmaker and proprietor of the Bowery Poetry Club , talk about their new project, a forthcoming book of poems called \"All the Voices: Where I'm From – Politically.\" They are are joined by contributors Simba Sandra Yangala, who emigrated to the U.S. from the Democratic Republic of Congo as a teenager, and Kieran Coughlan, who runs H&amp;C Truck Repair in Yonkers and invite poetry contributions before the September 30th deadline.\n\nThese interviews were polished up and edited for time. The original versions are available here:\nLincoln's America (Jul 13, 2022)\nWhat Forensic Science Isn't (Apr 4, 2022)\nCan Pickleball Keep Playing Nice? (Jul 22, 2022)\nThe End of Liberalism?

        "description": "Joe Puetz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Mikolas and Pujols doom Cubs and produce a Cardinals sweep. Boy, do I wish the pitching performance of Marcus Stroman was the central story of this game. Those of you who are regular readers here know that I’ll be talking about him, but first I have to give credit where it is due. The two top stories of Sunday’s game are Miles Mikolas and Albert Pujols. \nFor Mikolas, there were eight shutout innings allowing only two hits and a walk. For Mikolas, he is now 5-3 with a 2.16 in 14 starts plus two relief appearances covering 87⅔ innings in his career against the Cubs. Those numbers are tops among teams he has faced five or more times. The Cubs did beat him the last time they saw him in Wrigley Field, but he’s been a handful for the Cubs since he returned to the states after a mid-career trip to Japan. \nFor Pujols, he hit the decisive two-run homer. For his career, that was home run number 695. 59 of those homers have come against the Cubs and 149 runs batted in as well. He finishes his career with a .999 OPS against the Cubs. It was obvious once I saw it, but Albert’s largest number of homers were against the Astros at 62. He, of course, played many more games against them than the Cubs since they moved to the AL during his career, allowing him to see them plenty with the Cardinals but also during his time with the Angels. \nHat tips aside, this space is always about the Cubs. Not a lot went right for the Cubs on Sunday. But giant kudos to Marcus Stroman who was also terrific. Stroman threw seven innings allowing only four hits and no walks. Against a team that is heading to an NL Central crown, that’s one heck of a performance. I talked about him having a strong September to remember this season by. This start was definitely a great one to kick that off. \nStroman is clearly the number one positive. Franmil Reyes gets the second. Franmil had a double and a walk to account for half of the Cubs baserunners. Christopher Morel gets the third spot as he had the team’s other hit. \nAnd so the Cubs were responsible for a four-game swing in the NL Central standings. They only won six games against the Cardinals this year but defeated the Brewers 10 times in 2022. There is a lot of baseball still to be played, but it seems like the Cardinals would be fine regardless as that’s only about half of their lead over the Brewers. After the way the Brewers derailed the 2021 Cubs (winning 15 of 19), those who were around for that certainly took some pleasure from being a thorn in the side of the 2022 Brewers. \nLet’s get to the Heroes and Goats from Sunday’s loss. \nGame 134, September 4: Cardinals 2, Cubs 0 (56-78)\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs\n  \nReminder: Heroes and Goats are determined by WPA scores and are in no way subjective.\nTHREE HEROES:\n\n\nSuperhero: Marcus Stroman (.425). 7IP (25 batters), 4H, 5K \n\nHero: Franmil Reyes (.014). 1-2, 2B, BB\n\nSidekick: Manuel Rodriguez (.003). ⅓ IP (1 batter)\n\nTHREE GOATS:\n\n\nBilly Goat: Brandon Hughes (-.335). ⅔ IP (4 batters), 2H, 2R (2-2)\n\nGoat: Seiya Suzuki (-.154). 0-4, DP\n\nKid: Ian Happ (-.120). 0-3, DP\n\nWPA Play of the Game: Albert Pujols’ eighth inning pinch-hit, two-run homer supplied all of the offense in this game. (.291)\n*Cubs Play of the Game: Zach McKinstry walked with one out in the ninth. (.047)\n\nRizzo Award Cumulative Standings: (Top 5/Bottom 5)\nThe award is named for Anthony Rizzo, who finished first in this category three of the first four years it was in existence and four times overall. He also recorded the highest season total ever at +65.5. The point scale is three points for a Superhero down to negative three points for a Billy Goat.\n\nDavid Robertson +22.5\nScott Effross +17\nNico Hoerner +16.5\nChristopher Morel +15\nPatrick Wisdom +13.5\nDaniel Norris/Frank Schwindel/Rowan Wick -9.5\nYan Gomes -12\nRafael Ortega -13.5\nJason Heyward -15.5\n\nUp Next: An off day on Labor Day for the Cubs. Feels like a bit of irony, but the Cubs will take it. With the short trip home from St. Louis and a homestand starting Tuesday, this is one they can enjoy. \nOn Tuesday, they open a series with the Reds. Of course, due to the late start to the season due to the lockout and rescheduled games that resulted, the Cubs have nine game left against the Reds (53-79), including six at home. The teams are separated by one game in the standings. Wade Miley (1-0, 2.84) has actually pitched well the handful of times he’s been healthy enough to do so this year. Justin Dunn (1-2, 4.63) will provide the opposition.",

Trump is all but certain to announce another run for president to reclaim the White House after his one term in office. He wouldn’t be the first former president to attempt such a political comeback.\n\n\n\nIf history is our guide, however, Trump’s chances of serving two nonconsecutive terms is extremely low. In fact, the record of success by former presidents winning a term after being out of office is limited to just one example in more than 200 years, even though others have tried to return to the presidency.\n\n\n\nThe closest parallel of what Trump is attempting to replicate comes from the career of Democrat Grover Cleveland, our 22nd and 24th president.\n\n\n\nCleveland was first elected in 1884. He won the Electoral College with 219 votes against his Republican opponent James G. Blaine’s 182 electoral votes. Cleveland’s victory, however, was masked by his razor-thin margin of victory in his home state of New York, which he won by just over 1,000 votes. Had Cleveland lost New York, Blaine would have won the presidency and Cleveland likely would have been just a footnote to history.\n\n\n\nJust as Cleveland’s 1884 victory hinged on just a few votes in one state, in 2016, Trump’s margin over Hillary Clinton was because of small but significant victories in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. He won these three states by a total of less than 78,000 votes, even though he lost the nationwide popular vote by close to 3 million votes.\n\n\n\nIn 1888, Cleveland ran for a second term — and in 2020, Trump ran for a second term. They both lost. Cleveland won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College vote to Benjamin Harrison. Despite Trump’s unfounded protestations to the contrary, he lost the popular vote by more than 7 million votes and lost the Electoral College, relegating him to the status of former president.\n\n\n\nBy 1892, Cleveland was not content continuing to sit on the political sidelines, and so he made his comeback bid with another run at the presidency. The Democrats renominated him. In the general election, he took the keys to the White House back from Harrison with his wins in both the Electoral College and popular vote. Cleveland’s legacy was thus sealed as the only president to serve two nonconsecutive terms.\n\n\n\nWith the 2024 presidential election just a little more than two years away, Trump has made no secret of his desire to run for president again. Unlike Cleveland, who won the popular vote in all three of his presidential bids, Trump has never won the popular vote.\n\n\n\nWhile presidential elections give Republicans an edge in the Electoral College with sparsely populated conservative-leaning states, Trump’s chances of winning in 2024 are tempered by his tumultuous one term as president and by the multiple grand jury and other civil and criminal investigations into his actions before, during and after his presidency.\n\n\n\nFor Trump to win, he would need to draw votes from most Republicans and a significant number of independents. The 2024 political landscape is different than it was for Trump in 2016, when many decided to take a chance that a businessman might make a good president. He now has a documented track record of ignoring truth, undermining civility and shaking the foundations of our democracy. Knowing what we know, will voters be convinced to move him back into the White House?\n\n\n\nAside from whether Trump becomes the second president to win a nonconsecutive term, Cleveland and Trump lived in vastly different ethical worlds.\n\n\n\nCleveland, sometimes referred to as “Grover the Good,” was a man of principled integrity and honesty. When he was confronted with allegations that he had fathered a child outside of wedlock, he quickly admitted it.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, Trump’s business, political and personal affairs have been littered with thousands of lawsuits and questionable ethical practices — likely more than all other presidents combined.\n\n\n\nTrump still maintains a strong base of enthusiasm within the Republican Party, but current polls indicate an overall weakening of Trump’s support. In one poll, 57 percent of voters thought Trump should not run again.\n\n\n\nTrump’s legal exposures, from multiple investigations into the then-president’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results, and the Justice Department’s review of classified and national intelligence documents recovered from Mar-a-Lago in the FBI’s search, all paint a perilous path for the former president — who could very well be indicted after the upcoming midterm elections.\n\n\n\nCleveland was not the only president to make a comeback bid to the presidency. Martin Van Buren, Millard Fillmore, Ulysses Grant and Theodore Roosevelt all attempted to reclaim the presidency after their terms of office. None of them were successful.\n\n\n\nWill Trump replicate Cleveland’s return to the White House, or will his third national campaign for the presidency fall short like it has for others? Only time will tell, but the historical odds and the present-day legal threats facing Trump do not bode well for him to be inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\n\n\nMike Purdy is a presidential historian, the author of the “Presidential Friendships: How They Changed History” and the founder of PresidentialHistory.com.",

Lives Matter (BLM) leaders on Friday sued an executive of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation (GNF) on charges of syphoning $10 million in donations to the organization for use as his own \"personal piggy bank.\"\n\n\n\nWalter Mosley, an attorney representing BLM Grassroots — a separate entity from GNF — filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court against GNF and GNF board member Shalomyah Bowers, as well as his consulting firm.\n\n\n\nThe initial complaint, seeking financial relief and a court order halting GNF's use of the BLM identity, accuses Bowers of becoming a \"turned usurper\" and charging fees for BLM donors, which he then used for his own personal funds.\n\n\n\n\"When more than 300 movement leaders, as well as BLM Founders, insisted that he resign from GNF,\" the complaint reads, \"he continued to betray the public trust by self-dealing and breaching his fiduciary duties.\"\n\n\n\nMelina Abdullah, a founder of the BLM Los Angeles chapter and a co-director of the BLM Grassroots, held a press conference last week announcing the lawsuit.\n\n\n\n\"Global Network Foundation has been taken away from the people who built it,\" she said. \"Global Network Foundation is now led by a highly paid consultant who paid himself upwards of $2 million in a single year.\"\n\n\n\nAbdullah said Patrisse Cullors, a BLM founder, had created a transition plan to transfer control of GNF over to the grassroots organization, but GNF has locked her out of social media accounts and is amplifying messages she does not agree with.\n\n\n\nIn a statement following the press conference, the GNF Board of Directors denied the allegations, saying they were \"disappointed and dismayed at the false narrative\" spread by Abdullah and other BLM leaders, who they accused of taking $10,000 per month in personal stipends.\n\n\n\n\"We as Black people and Black-led organizations cannot continue spending all of our precious time and energy fighting and tearing each other down,\" the statement reads. \"We have no desire and little time to put private business out in the street. However, Melina Abdullah, BLMGR, and its leadership seem intent on fighting publicly about their desire to control the entirety of Black Lives Matter.\"\n\n\n\nThe board denied the entirety of the allegations, claiming they have requested meetings with Abdullah and other leaders; have shared social media accounts with BLM Grassroots; and argued there has never been a plan to transition GNF to the BLM Grassroots organization.\n\n\n\nThe legal battle is the latest controversy within the BLM organization, which began as a movement in 2013 after the death of 17-year-old Travyon Martin and the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood security guard who fatally shot Martin.\n\n\n\nAlicia Garza, Opal Tometi, and Cullors created the original hashtag for BLM, which eventually sprouted into local chapters that make up BLM Grassroots. BLM GNF was incorporated in 2017, primarily to be a fundraising component of the movement.\n\n\n\nAfter the death of George Floyd in 2020, the BLM movement gained renewed national and international attention. \n\n\n\nBut the organization's finances since then have come under increased scrutiny, particularly where a large chunk of $90 million raised in donations in 2020 has gone.\n\n\n\nAnd in late 2020, a group of ten original BLM local chapters announced they were severing ties with GNF over a lack of transparency and support.\n\n\n\nNew York Magazine also reported earlier this year that BLM executives bought a $6 million home with money donated to GNF.",

        "description": "At least nine mass shootings have taken place nationwide so far during Labor Day weekend, leaving at least 10 people dead, according to Gun Violence Archive.\n\n\n\nThe mass shootings, which the organization defines as incidents in which four or more people were shot or killed, not including the shooter, took place in cities including Norfolk, Va., Charleston, S.C., and Chicago, among others.\n\n\n\nThe deadliest shooting of the weekend so far, according to the group, took place in Saint Paul, Minn., where three people died and two others were injured on Sunday in the city’s Payne-Phalen neighborhood.\n\n\n\nThe local police department said officers were called at about 4:30 p.m. and found two people outside a home suffering from apparent gunshot wounds, both of whom were sent to the hospital, KARE reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe officers also found three more people, who were later pronounced dead, shot inside the home, the outlet reported.\n\n\n\n\"This unthinkable crime will not only affect the crime victims and their families, but it will affect the neighborhood where it occurred and our city as a whole,\" police spokesperson Sgt. Mike Ernster told KARE, adding that authorities had been called to the house at least 17 times in the last year.\n\n\n\nEarlier on Sunday, authorities said a shooting in Norfolk, Va., near the campus of Old Dominion University and Norfolk State University left two people dead and seven others injured.\n\n\n\nAuthorities identified the victims as Zabre Miller, 25, and Angelia McKnight, 19, later died at the hospital as a result of their injuries, officials said.\n\n\n\nClose to the same time, police responded to gunshots in downtown Charleston, S.C.\n\n\n\nFive people were injured in that shooting, near the intersection of King and Morris streets, and were sent to hospitals for non-life-threatening injuries, CNN reported. Police arrested two suspects.\n\n\n\nIn the suburbs of Washington, D.C., on Saturday night, a 16-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy were shot outside an AMC movie theater and were hospitalized, WJLA reported. The shooting came hours after a nearby AMC theater in Alexandria, Va., closed after receiving a threat, according to the outlet.\n\n\n\nAlso on Saturday, Birmingham, Ala., police officers found three gunshot victims in the 100 Block of 3rd Avenue West. Police said two of the victims died, identified as Jalen Jamarcus Tolbert, 24, and Marquse Terrail Yarbrough, 25.\n\n\n\nA shooting at Vick’s Supper Club in Palatka, Fla., on Saturday left two people dead and two others injured, police said. A fifth person was severely hurt after they were beaten with a “blunt object.”\n\n\n\nIn Canada, a series of stabbings left 10 people dead and 15 others injured. Authorities are searching for two suspects.",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Bombers kick off a seven game homestand with a four game set against the Twins. The Yankees limp home from a 4-6 road trip having tied or lost all three series. Their starting lineup took a beating on the road, with Andrew Benintendi breaking the hamate bone in his right hand, requiring surgery. Next up they face the Twins for four games at Yankee Stadium, and here are the projected starting pitching matchups.\nMonday: Jameson Taillon vs. Chris Archer, 1:05 P.M. EDT\nJameson Taillon was forced from his start against the Angels after getting struck in the forearm by a comebacker, however it looks like he and the Yankees dodged a bullet as he will not have to miss a start. After a shaky few starts in June and July, Taillon has now allowed three or fewer runs in eight of his last nine outings. In 26 starts, Taillon is 12-4 with a 3.97 ERA (97 ERA+), 4.09 FIP, and 117 strikeouts in 140.2 innings.\nThe Yankees get another crack at Chris Archer after he frustratingly held them to a run on two hits in five innings when he faced them earlier this year. He certainly has enjoyed pitching against the Yankees in his career — in 20 starts he’s pitched to a 3.03 ERA, 3.32 FIP, and 121:35 strikeout to walk ratio across 124.2 innings. He’s enjoying arguably his best campaign since he was traded from the Rays to the Pirates in 2018 having cut his home run rate almost in half since that season. In 23 starts, Archer is 2-7 with a 4.52 ERA (84 ERA+), 4.29 FIP, and 81 strikeouts in 95.2 innings.\nTuesday: Gerrit Cole vs. Joe Ryan, 7:05 P.M. EDT\nGerrit Cole was cruising through his last start against the Angels until a pair of seventh-inning errors by Josh Donaldson and Isiah Kiner-Falefa allowed Shohei Ohtani to win the game with a three-run blast. That said, he has looked better over his last five starts with a 2.16 ERA, though the struggles with the lone big inning continue to plague the Yankees ace. The slider continues to be a big weapon with a 45 percent whiff rate in July and August, though that is the pitch that the Twins teed off on in that infamous five home run game in June. In 27 starts, Cole is 10-7 with a 3.28 ERA (117 ERA+), and 3.22 FIP while leading the AL in strikeouts (204) and innings (164.2).\nJoe Ryan is having an admirable rookie campaign with a 3.88 ERA, though that becomes an even more respectable 3.25 when you take away his horror inning-eater outing against the Padres when he gave up 10 runs. Drafted by the Rays in the seventh round of the 2018 MLB Draft and traded to Minnesota for Nelson Cruz in 2021, Ryan actually debuted for the Twins at the end of last season but retained his rookie status through this year. He throws a fastball in the low-90s while employing a slider against righties and a changeup against lefties. In 22 starts, Ryan is 10-7 with a 3.88 ERA (98 ERA+), 4.28 FIP, and 121 strikeouts in 118.1 innings. \nWednesday: Domingo Germán vs. Sonny Gray, 7:05 P.M. EDT\nDomingo Germán was well on his way to a dominant outing last time out against the Rays until a seventh inning two-run homer put a bit of a damper on things. Still, he’s been quite effective since his nightmare season debut against the Astros, allowing three or fewer runs in each of the eight starts since. The curveball has been his go-to putaway pitch, registering strikeout and whiff rates north of 30 percent. In nine starts, Germán in 2-3 with a 3.12 ERA (124 ERA+), 4.32 FIP, and 32 strikeouts in 49 innings. \nSonny Gray is expected to face his old team on Wednesday, however the situation is fluid after the 32-year-old exited his last start with a hamstring injury. He was in the midst of a bounceback campaign relative to the last two seasons, having exchanged some strikeouts for a much better walk rate. He’s also added significant movement to the cutter, slider, and curveball, the cutter in particular exhibiting the most horizontal movement vs. average of any cutter in baseball. In 21 starts, Gray is 7-4 with a 3.10 ERA (123 ERA+), 3.43 FIP, and 101 strikeouts in 104.2 innings.\nThursday: TBD vs. TBD, 7:05 P.M. EDT\nNeither team has announced an official starter for the series finale. This would be Clarke Schmidt’s regular spot in the rotation. He doesn’t appear to be completely built up to a full starter’s load, having completed 4.1 innings in each of his two starts since his most recent call-up while having his pitch count held below 65 in four of his last five multi-inning big league appearances. In 19 games (three starts), Schmidt is 5-4 with a 3.02 ERA (128 ERA+), 3.43 FIP, and 38 strikeouts in 41.2 innings.\nHowever, it’s since been reported that Nestor Cortes is on schedule to return from injury in time to start Thursday’s contest. The lefty landed on the 15-day IL retroactive to August 22nd with a groin strain. The Yankees will be thrilled to have arguably their best starting pitcher of the season back, and this two-week hiatus may have been a blessing in disguise for the southpaw having blown past his previous career-highs in starts and innings pitched. In 23 starts, Cortes is 9-4 with a 2.68 ERA (144 ERA+), 3.41 FIP, and 133 strikeouts in 131 innings.\nTyler Mahle would be the regularly-scheduled starter, however he exited his start on Saturday with pain in the same shoulder that forced him out of his previous start and landed him on the IL for two-and-a-half weeks. It was particularly worrying to see the fastball almost five mph slower than his season average. In his place, Aaron Sanchez could get the nod after relieving Mahle on Saturday. Sanchez started the season with the Nationals before being DFA’d in May with an 8.33 ERA. Since joining the Twins and having his contract selected August 1st, he’s cut his ERA by keeping the ball in the ballpark while doubling his strikeouts. In 11 appearances (10 starts), Sanchez is 3-4 with a 6.98 ERA (56 ERA+), 4.69 FIP, and 34 strikeouts in 49 innings.",

Feigning enthusiastic support for the positions Liz Truss staked out in her interview with Kuenssberg, Lycett had co-panellist Emily Thornberry tittering, and the show’s host on a very uncertain footing, with an appearance that went on to dominate coverage of this launch of the BBC’s major new politics format.Is that a travesty? Or – as Lycett’s many supporters would have it – a public service? “Here was something genuinely subversive,” in his fellow comedian Katy Brand’s words, “delivered so politely you could barely feel the blade until it was out.” The dividing lines were drawn, between those who feel that the seriousness of Kuenssberg’s show (at a very serious time) was undermined by Lycett’s prank, and those who see that prank as the most serious and morally responsible feature of the whole hour.Brian Logan is the Guardian’s comedy critic Continue reading...",

        "description": "This year’s 12-day run of the Minnesota State Fair marked a return to normal on the sprawling yet crowded fairgrounds after two summers of pandemic disruption. The wide smile on Tracy Harris’s face is as bright as the music coming from the quartet on stage.“It is a complete pleasure to be here, she said. “It’s a beautiful day. And just look at these guys singing, they are adorable.”She sat on a bench in the shade as the Four Dads, part of the Plymouth Rockers Performing Senior Chorus, belted out oldies on the fair’s many side stages. Harris said it’s filling a spot in her soul. She’s been coming here for more than three decades.“It&#x27;s a great way to end the summer so definitely was quite a lack — not being able to go to the fair for the past few years. So it&#x27;s super fun to be here again,” Harris said.It’s safe to say the fair feels like the gatherings of old. The fair was shelved in 2020 amid COVID-19 concern and attendance was way down last year given restrictions and continuing unease. This year, it’s headed for the 2 million mark again, with almost 250,000 showing up Saturday alone.The final weekend included a security scare. A fight on the Midway between what authorities said were groups of young people escalated. Even with dozens of law enforcement on scene, somebody fired a gun and hit another person in the leg. It was a non life-threatening wound but the crowd frantically scattered and the fair closed early.Fair Police Chief Ron Knafla says the scene was chaotic but order was quickly restored. SaturdayShooting incident injures one, shuts down Minnesota State Fair on Saturday night“I don&#x27;t know what else could have been done. To engage in such a brazen act in a crowd of people with no regard for the safety or the lives of others. It&#x27;s just disgusting in my opinion. And I don&#x27;t know what else to say about it.”Security was beefed up for the final two days. And by the elbow-to-elbow crowds, the incident didn’t appear to scare visitors off.“It happens. If you worry about things like that, it&#x27;s no different than it&#x27;s ever been,” said Shane Ebertowski of Cambridge.He gave his daughter and a friend space as they headed for rides and games. He had no qualms about their safety or fair security in general.“I guess I don&#x27;t live my life that way,” he said. “The things are gonna happen they&#x27;re gonna happen I want to have a lot of control over it.”Hamline Church Dining Hall is one of two church halls left at the Minnesota State Fair, as seen on Aug. 31, 2022. This year, they are celebrating their 125 anniversary as the oldest food concession at the Fair.Sam Stroozas | MPR NewsThe fair offered its traditional potpourri of visual stimulation, ubiquitous sound and ample sustenance — pies, ice cream, hot dogs, sweet corn and oh, so much more.Steve Anderson is among the many people to try out the pickle pizza, some of the newest fair fare. Anderson says he returned to the fair as soon as he could after the 2020 cancellation.“I was back last year. Come on. Not gonna scare me away with a little virus,” Anderson said.Annette Roth of Robbinsdale says even though there was a fair last year, it didn’t feel like the fair.“People were spread out. And I think there was much more of course, we had to wear masks. So this time, it&#x27;s a sense of back to normal,” she said.She and her sister gaze at the prize winning cookies, cakes, breads and other baked goods in the creative arts building. It’s a must-stop on their annual fair tour — now going on 55 years.“This was something our mother brought us to the fair as, as a quote unquote, vacation. I mean, it was someplace. It&#x27;s because you&#x27;re out of a totally different zone. Right. You&#x27;re not thinking about what&#x27;s going on. You&#x27;re just in a suspended reality.”The suspended reality comes to an end Monday night. But don&#x27;t fret, the fair returns on Aug. 24, 2023, just more than 350 days away.

        "description": "Beach chairs are seen as the sun rises in Ocean City, N.J., on Aug. 18. This is not the above-average hurricane season experts predicted — at least, not yet.Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesFor months, the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season was notable for one reason: a complete lack of hurricanes. That finally changed on Friday, when Danielle strengthened into the Atlantic&#x27;s first hurricane since last October.The 2022 season had been predicted to continue the recent run of storm activity that pushed meteorologists deep into their annual list of alphabetized storm names, even exhausting it entirely. But so far, it&#x27;s been a quiet summer: 60 days elapsed from Tropical Storm Colin&#x27;s demise on July 3 and Danielle&#x27;s arrival on Sept. 1. &quot;No tropical cyclones formed in the basin during August,&quot; as the National Hurricane Center said in its monthly recap. &quot;This is quite unusual and is the first time that has occurred since 1997, and is only the third time that has happened since 1950.&quot;Weather conditions can change rapidly, and dangerous storms could still form in the coming weeks, experts warn. Just days after Danielle formed, for instance, another tropical storm, Earl, formed.Why is there a gap between the prediction and reality?This is not the above-average hurricane season experts predicted — at least, not yet. Scientists at Colorado State University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted the Atlantic&#x27;s seventh above-normal season in a row, with more than the average of 14 named storms.Their reasons were solid: The climate pattern known as La Niña in the Pacific Ocean normally brings a more active hurricane season in the Atlantic. In addition, water temperatures in the tropical Atlantic have been among the warmest ever recorded, providing plenty of fuel for storms.&quot;Those two factors alone were expected to drive an active Atlantic hurricane season, but it hasn&#x27;t turned out that way,&quot; meteorologist Jeff Masters told NPR. He&#x27;s a hurricane expert for Yale Climate Connections and a co-founder of Weather Underground.&quot;It was not expected and the reasons for it are not well understood,&quot; Masters said (more on that below).What does history say about a slow start to storm season?It&#x27;s a mixed picture, with a small sample size. But experts warn not to assume there&#x27;s less risk just because the first months of hurricane season have been calm.Since routine aircraft reconnaissance began in 1944, only two other seasons didn&#x27;t see a named storm in August. The first came in 1961, which pivoted into a very active season. A flurry of dangerous hurricanes formed in September alone — including Hurricane Carla, which devastated the Texas coast.Flooding is seen in Galveston, Texas, after Hurricane Carla hit in September 1961.William Lovelace/Express/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesThe second such season, in 1997, remained a quiet one. But Jamie Rhome, acting director at the National Hurricane Center, noted in a statement sent to NPR that in 1992, the storm season had also been quiet, before Hurricane Andrew struck South Florida and Louisiana in August. &quot;It only takes one landfalling hurricane to make it a bad season for you, and we still have three months to go before the end of the Atlantic hurricane season,&quot; Rhome said.So, what&#x27;s happened so far this year?Hurricanes, it turns out, have two big enemies: dry air and wind shear. This year, those conditions are being boosted by the Bermuda High, a high-pressure system that sits over the Atlantic Ocean. The Bermuda High is currently smaller and farther north than normal — leading to high temperatures from Canada to Europe. It&#x27;s also allowing the powerful jet stream to dip far to the south over the central Atlantic, preventing hurricanes from forming. &quot;When high winds get up on top of a developing system that&#x27;s trying to be a hurricane, those high winds will tear it apart,&quot; Masters said.The same dynamic is funneling dry air to the Atlantic that also saps storms.&quot;Things are all upside-down&quot; this summer, a hurricane expert saysClimate change is causing hurricanes to get more powerful on average. In general, air that&#x27;s becoming warmer and more moist provides more fuel for extreme weather, from hurricanes to intense inland storms. Researchers are still working to learn how rising temperatures might affect the overall number of storms that form.&quot;Hurricanes fundamentally form in response to unequal heating of the poles compared to the equator. They&#x27;re meant to redistribute heat,&quot; Masters said. But their services have not been required this summer, because sunny conditions have brought heat waves to northern latitudes and raised ocean temperatures in the far north to resemble tropical warmth.With little need for hurricanes to transport heat, the Atlantic isn&#x27;t the only place seeing a calmer storm season. &quot;The western Pacific has also been super quiet. We&#x27;re somewhere around maybe 60% of average activity there,&quot; Masters said. &quot;So it&#x27;s kind of a global thing going on here. It&#x27;s not just the Atlantic: Things are all upside-down.&quot;Does this mean we&#x27;re in for an easier hurricane season?We might see less powerful hurricanes compared to recent years, Masters said, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they wouldn&#x27;t be dangerous. Because of warm ocean temperatures, he expects any cyclone that does form to pack a great deal of water, raising the risk of flooding — the main cause of death from hurricanes.&quot;It&#x27;s unlikely we&#x27;re going to have an above-average season now,&quot; he said, noting that the hurricane season is nearing its traditional halfway point of Sept. 10.But forecasters warn not to become complacent in the absence of hurricanes.&quot;It&#x27;s still early. It only takes one bad storm to make a hurricane season for the ages,&quot; Masters said. &quot;So we still have to be vigilant.&quot;\nAs Colorado State&#x27;s researchers said when they made their seasonal forecast, anyone who lives in an area that could be affected by a hurricane or tropical storm &quot;should prepare the same for every season, regardless of how much activity is predicted.&quot;\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

        "title": "Rays Designate Matt Wisler For Assignment",
        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/rays-designate-matt-wisler-for-assignment.html",
        "description": "The Rays have designated right-hander Matt Wisler for assignment, per a team announcement. His roster spot will go to righty Luis Patiño, who has been recalled to start today&#8217;s game against the Red Sox.\nWisler, 29, began his MLB career with Atlanta, mostly as a starter. He had been a highly-touted prospect, landing in the top 50 on Baseball America&#8217;s top 100 in both 2014 and 2015. However, he didn&#8217;t fare so well in his first tastes of the majors and eventually transitioned to more bullpen work. As a reliever, he started leaning heavily on his slider, having a tremendous breakout with the Twins in 2020. During that shortened campaign, Wisler threw 25 1/3 innings over 18 games, including four starts, though none longer than two innings. He registered a tiny 1.07 ERA that year along with a 32.7% strikeout rate. Despite that excellent showing, he was non-tendered by the Twins, perhaps due to his 13.1% walk rate.\nWisler then signed with the Giants for 2021 but struggled to a 6.05 ERA, getting flipped to the Rays in June last year. He&#8217;s been solid since the move to Tampa, registering a 2.15 ERA in the post-trade portion of 2021 and then a 2.25 ERA here in 2022. That ERA is nice, but the Rays are likely moving on because of some less-impressive numbers under the hood. His control is fine, with an 8% walk rate on the year, but Wisler&#8217;s 19.9% strikeout rate is a noticeable drop from the previous three seasons, where he was hovering around the 30% mark. The reason why that hasn&#8217;t resulted in more earned runs is probably his .198 batting average on balls in play this year. Wisler&#8217;s 30.7% hard hit rate is in the 93rd percentile in terms of limiting hard contact this season, but that BABIP is still about 100 points lower than his career mark coming into the year. The Rays must have been expecting some regression, based on this decision to let him go.\nWith the trade deadline having passed, Wisler will be placed on outright waivers or release waivers in the coming days. There&#8217;s little distinction between the two in this case, as Wisler has over five years of MLB service time. That means he has the right to reject an outright assignment and elect free agency without forfeiting any salary. He and the Rays avoided arbitration in March by agreeing to a $2.16MM contract for the season, leaving about $345K to be paid out.\nFor teams considering a claim, Wisler is certainly an interesting case. He has continued to increase his slider usage each year, throwing it 70.5% of the time in 2019, followed by 83.4% in 2020, 90.9% last year and 91.5% this season. That led to huge strikeout numbers the first three years, though not so much this season. He&#8217;s a free agent this winter, meaning there would be no long-term benefits to claiming him. The short-term appeal would also be limited by the fact that the postseason eligibility date has passed. That means another team could use Wisler down the stretch but not in the postseason. If he clears waivers, the Rays would be on the h0ok for the remainder of that salary. Wisler could elect free agency and sign with any club, who would only have to pay him the prorated league minimum, with that amount being subtracted from what the Rays pay.\nMarc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times tweeted the roster moves prior to the official announcement.",

By and large, they are intentionally unremarkable, with straightforward (and sometimes boxy) frames and unassuming black finishes.\nSo when Lenovo departs from this basic template, as it has for the new ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1, it's worth talking about. The Z13 is recognizable as a ThinkPad, but it has eccentric flourishes like brushed gold accents and a vegan leather lid. There's also a less-flashy gray aluminum version, if a business laptop with gold accents and vegan leather feels less \"stylish\" and more \"dad's midlife crisis\" to you.\nHands-down the most impressive thing about the Z13 is its Ryzen 6000 CPU and integrated Radeon GPU. I began testing the Z13 at around the same time as I was being underwhelmed by the 12th-generation Intel processors in the Framework Laptop and Lenovo's own X1 Carbon Gen 10, and the Ryzen CPU is just better than Intel's by just about any conceivable metric. But my reaction to the laptop that has been built around this chip is more reserved.Read 22 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "I said it in my review and I&#8217;ll say it again: for my use case, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 5 is my personal favorite Chromebook tablet ever made.  Though its size and form factor may not make it the right fit for everyone, there&#8217;s simply no denying the benefits included in Lenovo&#8217;s large, OLED-screen-toting ChromeOS tablet.\n\n\n\nI even grabbed it off the shelf to write this post simply because I enjoy using it so much.  As soon as I opened it up after a very long period of inactivity, it came right to life and was still sitting at around 70% battery.  After plugging it in and doing a few quick tasks to get up and running on this Chromebook, I&#8217;m already nearing 100% charge and I know full well that if I came off the charger for the rest of the day, I&#8217;d be fine.  And maybe even into tomorrow, too.\n\n\n\nWe have to quickly mention the star of the show with this one: the 13.3-inch OLED screen.  It&#8217;s just so gorgeous and colorful that it makes everything you do look better.  The brightness is great, the viewing angles are perfect, and the aspect ratio feels natural in desktop mode where I tend to use it most of the time.\n\n\n\nIt&#8217;s a tablet, so thin bezels, a light carry weight and a slim silhouette are all here, too, making this Chromebook look modern and slick on the desk and easy to hold in the hands.  While I don&#8217;t think a 13.3-inch, 16:9 tablet is the best form factor in the world, it is surprisingly easy to use as a tablet and great at gaming and watching videos with its quad speaker setup.  \n\n\n\nInside there&#8217;s the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, so things hum along quite nicely even when I have a few desks, multiple apps, and lots of windows up and running.  Seriously, working from it this morning has only cemented the fact that this tablet is easily my overall favorite in the ChromeOS ecosystem right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn sale for $349 right now\n\n\n\nSo, naturally, when a device I enjoy this much drops to its lowest price ever, I have to let you all know!  Right now, over at Best Buy, you can snag the Duet 5 for the lowest price we&#8217;ve ever seen on sale: $349.  That&#8217;s a whopping $150 off!  Granted, there was a Snapdragon Insider deal a few weeks ago, but that required some extra steps and for you to belong to the email group prior to the deal happening.\n\n\n\n\nBuy the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 5 at Best Buy\n\n\n\n\nThis time around, there are no caveats or extra steps.  Just head over to Best Buy, throw it in your cart, and enjoy it when it arrives.  I can guarantee you&#8217;ll get far more worth out of this tablet than the $349 price tag would allude to.  With the quality build, gorgeous screen, quad speakers and the keyboard cover/stand in the box, this Chromebook deal is a hard one to beat.  But it won&#8217;t last long.  Grab it at this price while you can!\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Venice film festival: Martin McDonagh reunites Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson in remotest Ireland for an oddball study of isolation and hurtMartin McDonagh’s new film is a macabre black comedy of toxic male pride and wounded male feelings, a shaggy-dog story of wretchedness and a dance of death between aggression and self-harm, set on an imaginary island called Inisherin off the Irish coast. It’s happening in 1923 during the civil war; the additional symbolic acrimony is offered to us on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. As with so many of McDonagh’s works, the glint of the unburied hatchet is all too visible in the murk, and the setting is a stylised and ironised Irish rural scene not so very far from John Millington Synge. Mutilation is a familiar motif. There are plenty of genuine laughs in this movie, but each of them seems to dovetail into a banshee-wail of pain. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photo by Frank Jansky/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Guardians need to figure out how to win again — fast Nine of the Guardians’ final 30 games will come against the Royals (including six games to end the season), the most they will face any team down the stretch. Essentially, their key to regaining the sole AL Central lead and a path to the playoffs goes through Kansas City. \nThat shouldn’t be a tall order for this or any team. The Royals stink. They know it, we know it, everyone knows it. But that’s the beast of a 162-game season — depending on when you’re meeting a team they might not be playing like a 55-80 team with the worst pitching staff and one of the worst offenses in baseball. And a 68-win team might be playing like a basement dweller instead of one vying for a playoff spot. \nIf the Guardians can’t figure things out soon, the Twins are going to steamroll ahead and take the AL Central — and make no mistake about it, no AL Central team is getting a Wild Card spot. It’s winning the division or bust here. \nThe good news is that the Guardians can turn everything around with one game. Get off on the right foot, start feeling good about themselves, and get hot going into the playoffs. They are 2-8 in their last 10, and currently riding a miserable five-game losing streak. Last night they finally managed multiple runs for the first time in a calendar week, but still lost. Do they find the magic again and use it to beat the hapless Royals? \nPitching matchups are heavily in the Guardians’ favor, with Triston McKenzie and Shane Bieber both going for Cleveland and rookie Cody Morris potentially facing Daniel Lynch, who has surrendered three or more runs in five of his last six starts. \nBut can they score? \nTeam at a glance\n\n\nRecord: 55-80 (13th in AL)\n\nRuns Scored: 535 (12th in AL)\n\nRun Differential: -146\n\nLast 10: 5-5\n\nSlash: .245/.308/.382\n\nwOBA: .304 (11th in AL)\n\nwRC+: 94 (12th in AL)\n\nERA: 4.76 (15th in AL)\n\nSIERA: 4.45 (15th in AL)\n\nK-BB%: 9.2% (15th in AL)\n\nProjected starters\nMonday, Sept. 5, 8:10 p.m. ET: RHP Brady Singer vs. RHP Triston McKenzieTuesday, Sept. 6, 8:10 p.m. ET: LHP Kris Bubic vs. RHP Shane BieberWednesday, Sept. 7, 8:10 p.m. ET: TBD (LHP Daniel Lynch*) vs. TBD (RHP Cody Morris*)\nRoster\n\n40-man roster\nDepth chart",

        "description": "Venice film festival: Martin McDonagh reunites Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson in remotest Ireland for an oddball study of isolation and hurtMartin McDonagh’s new film is a macabre black comedy of toxic male pride and wounded male feelings, a shaggy-dog story of wretchedness and a dance of death between aggression and self-harm, set on an imaginary island called Inisherin off the Irish coast. It’s happening in 1923 during the civil war; the additional symbolic acrimony is offered to us on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. As with so many of McDonagh’s works, the glint of the unburied hatchet is all too visible in the murk, and the setting is a stylised and ironised Irish rural scene not so very far from John Millington Synge. Mutilation is a familiar motif. There are plenty of genuine laughs in this movie, but each of them seems to dovetail into a banshee-wail of pain. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Oil-producing alliance OPEC+ announced on Monday it will slightly lower oil production in October, eliminating the 100,000 barrel per day increase that began this month.\n\n\n\nOPEC leaders made the decision after gathering for a meeting, where they noted the 100,000 barrel per day increase was only intended for September. OPEC produces around 28 million barrels per day.\n\n\n\nThe 13-member alliance said in a statement the \"higher volatility and increased uncertainties require the continuous assessment of market conditions and a readiness to make immediate adjustments to production.\"\n\n\n\nThe price for a crude barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil climbed 3 percent after the announcement, reaching $90 per barrel, while Brent crude was also up 3 percent to $96 per barrel.\n\n\n\nPresident Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia, the second largest OPEC member nation, over the summer as high gas prices beleaguered Americans and sunk his approval ratings. \n\n\n\nAfter Biden met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and fist-bumped the Saudi leader, OPEC announced a mostly symbolic increase of 100,000 barrels per day for September.\n\n\n\nGas prices have fallen to a national average of $3.78, according to the American Automobile Association, a significant drop from a historic $5 a gallon in June.\n\n\n\nThe oil market is expected to tighten with Russia threatening to cut off Europe from its gas supply over tensions with the war in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nThe price for a barrel of crude oil has also fallen from a high of around $120 for both Brent and WTI.",

        "description": "Back in 1972, when Democrats nominated George McGovern for president, McGovern’s campaign manager called a Democratic congressional candidate in Ohio.\n\n\n\n“I have good news,” the campaign manager said. “Senator McGovern is going to come to your district to campaign.”\n\n\n\n“That is good news,” the Democratic House candidate replied. “Unfortunately, I won’t be here. I’ll be in Florida, visiting my mother.”\n\n\n\n“But I haven’t told you when we’re coming,” the campaign manager said.\n\n\n\n“It doesn’t matter,” the Ohio candidate replied. “Whenever you come, I’ll be in Florida visiting my mother.”\n\n\n\nUntil recently, it looked like things could be that bad for President Biden this year. Biden’s job approval ratings have been below 50 percent for the past year, dipping below 40 percent a month ago. The good news? Things have been looking up a bit lately for President Biden, especially since Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act and student loan relief. The latest Morning Consult-Politico poll, taken Aug. 19-21, shows Biden with 43 percent approval, up from 39 percent earlier in the month. That is still way below the 50 percent approval level Biden would need to give his party a midterm boost. But it’s less scary for Democrats than it was a month ago.\n\n\n\nThis year’s midterm election is likely to be an unusual contest. The results will be shaped by two unpopular presidents — current Democratic President Joe Biden (who has a 54 percent personal unfavorable rating in the Morning Consult poll) and former Republican President Donald Trump (57 percent unfavorable).\n\n\n\nDemocrats are fighting history. In 18 midterm elections since World War II, the president’s party has lost House seats in all but two. That’s mainly because voter turnout shrinks by about one third in midterm elections, which are like a three-ring circus with no main event. Most of the turnout loss comes from casual voters who vote once every four years and disproportionately support the party of the winning presidential candidate. The president’s party has suffered an average loss of 26 House seats since World War II, easily enough to overturn the Democrats’ current majority of five.\n\n\n\nThe two exceptional midterms — where the president’s party gained House seats — occurred in years when the midterms turned into referendums on popular presidents. In 1998, President Bill Clinton was facing impeachment over his affair with Monica Lewinsky — but the economy was booming, and Democrats turned out in unusually high numbers to save their president. It happened again four years later, in the 2002 midterm, when President George W. Bush was still riding a high a year after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\n\n\nPresident Biden is nowhere near those peaks of popularity. But he has something else going for him: the Trump threat.\n\n\n\nNearly two years out of office, Trump is soaking up news coverage and pushing the current president out of the spotlight. That may be doing Biden more good than Trump.\n\n\n\nTrump and his MAGA followers have seized control of the Republican Party. What it amounts to is a takeover of the GOP by the radical right. The radical right has been a force in U.S. politics for a long time, but it only came to power with Trump’s election in 2016. It’s determined to get that power back.\n\n\n\nThe big story from this year’s Republican primaries is the sweeping victories of 2020 election deniers — Republicans who refuse to accept Trump’s loss. According to the Washington Post, a majority of this year’s Republican primary winners (250 candidates in 469 contests) support Trump’s claim that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n\n\nThat invites a straightforward strategy for Democrats in 2022: Re-run the 2020 election — make it another contest between divisive and extremist Republicans and Democrats who are showing they can deliver (on infrastructure, prescription drug prices, gun safety, veterans’ health care, climate change and student loans).\n\n\n\nThe key moment in this year’s campaign was the Supreme Court ruling on June 24 taking away the constitutional right to abortion. You cannot take away a right that Americans have had for almost 50 years without provoking a fierce political backlash. Abortion, more than any other issue, proves to most voters that extremists have taken over the Republican Party.\n\n\n\nIt has also enabled President Biden to find his political voice.\n\n\n\n“If the MAGA Republicans win control of the Congress,” the president warned in Maryland, “it won’t matter where you live. Women won’t have the right to choose anywhere — anywhere!” He added: “This is not your father’s Republican Party. This is a different deal.”\n\n\n\nA tough message like that might even get Biden invited to campaign in Ohio.\n\n\n\nBill Schneider is an emeritus professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University and author of “Standoff: How America Became Ungovernable” (Simon &amp; Schuster).",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3629699-chinas-cost-free-gulag-for-muslims/",
        "description": "China’s prolonged detention of more than 1 million Muslims in Xinjiang represents the largest mass incarceration of people on religious grounds since the Nazi era. Yet, disturbingly, China has incurred no international costs.\n\n\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping, the brain behind the scheme, and his inner circle have faced no consequences for sustaining the Muslim gulag since at least March 2017. Despite two successive U.S. administrations describing the unparalleled repression in Xinjiang as “genocide” and “crimes against humanity,” Western actions against China have largely been symbolic.\n\n\n\nThe just-released report on Xinjiang by the United Nations’ human rights office cites serious human-rights violations there and recommends that Beijing take “prompt steps to release all individuals arbitrarily deprived of their liberty” in that sprawling ethnic-minority homeland.\n\n\n\nYet this report, paradoxically, is a fresh reminder that China has escaped scot-free, with little prospect that it will be held to account for its mass internment of Muslim minorities, including expanding detention sites in Xinjiang since 2019. The Xinjiang repression also includes forced sterilization and abortion, torture of detainees, slave labor and draconian curbs on freedom of religion and movement.\n\n\n\nThe report’s release came after nearly a yearlong delay and just minutes before the four-year term of Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, ended. U.N. investigators had compiled the Xinjiang report almost a year ago, but Bachelet kept stalling its release, despite growing pressure from Western countries.\n\n\n\nIn May, after lengthy discussions with Beijing on arrangements, Bachelet undertook a controversial official visit to China, the first by a U.N. high commissioner for human rights since 2005. During her tenure, Bachelet – a former Chilean president and political detainee under dictator Augusto Pinochet – stayed mum on the Chinese repression in Xinjiang (and Tibet). She said nothing on the crackdown in Xinjiang even when she briefly visited that region during her restrictive China tour, which glossed over abuses by Xi’s regime.\n\n\n\nBachelet had earlier acknowledged that she was under “tremendous pressure” over the report, with China asking her to bury it. The eventual release of the report, minutes before Bachelet’s retirement at midnight on Aug. 31, indicated that she did not want her successor or temporary replacement to take credit for publishing it. Failing to release the report would have left a glaring black mark on her tenure.\n\n\n\nDays before her retirement, Bachelet sent a copy of the report to Beijing because, as she explained in a Sept. 1 statement, she “wanted to take the greatest care to deal with the responses and inputs received from the (Chinese) government last week.” In response to the 48-page U.N. assessment, China wrote a 131-page rebuttal, with its foreign ministry calling the report a “farce.”\n\n\n\nChina has been emboldened by the international community’s indifference and indulgence. It successfully hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics, probably the most divisive games since the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics, which helped strengthen the hands of Germany’s Adolf Hitler.\n\n\n\nUnderscoring China’s growing economic power and geopolitical clout, even Muslim countries, by and large, have remained shockingly silent on the Xinjiang repression. As if that weren’t bad enough, the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation in March honored Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi as a speaker at its foreign ministers’ forum in Pakistan.\n\n\n\nXi’s&nbsp;Muslim gulag has made a mockery of the 1948&nbsp;Genocide Convention, to which China acceded in 1983 (with the&nbsp;rider&nbsp;that it does not consider itself bound by Article IX, the clause allowing any party in a dispute to lodge a complaint with the International Court of Justice). The Genocide Convention requires its parties, which include the United States, to “prevent and punish” acts of genocide.\n\n\n\nChinese authorities have subjected Uyghur and other Muslim groups in Xinjiang, including ethnic Kazakhs and Kyrgyz, to Orwellian levels of surveillance and control over many details of life. As Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo warned, China is weaponizing biotechnology to “pursue control over its people and its repression of members of ethnic and religious minority groups.”\n\n\n\nThe Xinjiang repression is aimed at indoctrinating not just political dissidents and religious zealots but entire Muslim communities by imposing large-scale deprogramming of Islamic identities. A gulag archipelago of 380 internment camps (or “reeducation hospitals,” as Beijing calls them) has become integral to this larger assault on Islam.\n\n\n\nIt is against this background that the carefully worded U.N. report warns that, “The extent of arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim groups … and deprivation more generally of fundamental rights enjoyed individually and collectively, may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.” The report cited “patterns of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” in the detention centers, including “credible” allegations of sexual violence.\n\n\n\nThe U.N. report may carry the imprimatur of the world’s only truly universal organization and its member states, yet China was quick to pour scorn on it. Just as it rubbished a 2016 international arbitral tribunal&nbsp;ruling&nbsp;that invalidated its territorial claims in the South China Sea, China ridiculed the U.N. report, calling it a pack of “disinformation and lies.”\n\n\n\nThe 1945-46 Nuremberg Military Tribunal, set up after Germany’s surrender in World War II, prosecuted those involved in crimes against humanity, the same crimes now being perpetrated in Xinjiang. Yet, with China a rising power, there seems little prospect that Chinese officials behind the Muslim gulag will face similar justice.\n\n\n\nIndeed, just as China responded to the tribunal’s ruling by accelerating its expansionism in the South China Sea, including militarizing the region, it could step up its repression in Xinjiang until it manages to fully Sinicize and tame Muslim groups.\n\n\n\nBrahma Chellaney is a geostrategist and the author of nine books, including the award-winning “Water: Asia’s New Battleground” (Georgetown University Press).

        "description": "Thatcherism was disastrous 40 years ago, but the new prime minister seems intent on reviving it to meet the crises of 2022Liz Truss and her likely chancellor of the exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, belong to a particular generation, many of whom once asked their parents: “Can a man be prime minister?” Not even four years old when Margaret Thatcher took power, 15 when she lost it and well into adulthood before the Tories were finally defeated, their earliest political awakenings would have taken place against the long backdrop of Thatcherism.This biographical context is acknowledged in the notorious political tract that Truss and Kwarteng co-authored with Priti Patel, Dominic Raab and Chris Skidmore, Britannia Unchained, published in 2012. “All five authors grew up in a period where Britain was improving its performance relative to the rest of the world,” it says. “The 1980s, contrary to the beliefs of many on the left, were a successful decade for Britain.” Their objective is to resurrect political dreams from their own childhood.William Davies is a sociologist and political economist.

        "description": "A vehicle drives through a residential neighborhood in Los Angeles.Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty ImagesBank of America launched a pilot program last week that foregoes a down payment, closing cost, minimum credit score and mortgage insurance for some first-time homebuyers in some Black and/or Latino neighborhoods. The goal is to bolster homeownership among communities that have historically faced trouble in the real estate market and particularly help Black and Latino families build wealth over time. Some experts say it&#x27;s a good step forward, but worry the program will not go far enough to support homeowners after they have purchased a home.&quot;It&#x27;s not that we just get folks into the home, but that we&#x27;re also able to help them have the savings, the resources necessary to make sure their homes are safe and healthy in the long run,&quot; Samira Payne, director of community revitalization at Rebuilding Together, a nonprofit group that focuses on safe and healthy housing, told NPR. What the program entailsEligibility will mainly be determined by income, home location and payment history for bills such as rent, phone, utilities and auto insurance. Applicants are also required to complete a homebuyer certification course.The initiative is taking place in Charlotte, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles and Miami, specifically in neighborhoods where Black and/or Latino residents make up the majority. &quot;Homeownership strengthens our communities and can help individuals and families to build wealth over time,&quot; AJ Barkley, head of neighborhood and community lending for Bank of America, said in a statement.Depending on the success of the initiative, the company will consider expanding in the months ahead, a spokesperson for Bank of America told NPR. The racial gap in homeownership Racial inequities in the country&#x27;s housing system date back to slavery and were reinforced by segregating practices such as redlining, where federal agencies refused to insure mortgages to people in certain areas. The term is most associated with Black neighborhoods.Today, many residents in predominantly Black or Hispanic neighborhoods continue to struggle in the housing market because of discriminatory practices.In 2020, Black and Hispanic applicants were more likely to be rejected for mortgage loans than their white or Asian counterparts, according to a February report from the National Association of Realtors. While white, Asian and Hispanic Americans all saw &quot;decadelong highs&quot; in homeownership rates that year, the rate for Black Americans turned out to be slightly lower in 2020 than in 2010. No-down payment or minimum credit score will help Black, Latino and low-income white borrowersFor some prospective homebuyers, it can take years or decades to save up for a down payment on a home. That can be especially true for Black and Latino families who make about half as much as the average white household, according to a 2021 report from the Federal Reserve. &quot;Even a 3% down payment on a home is a level of wealth or just spare cash that many families don&#x27;t have. And that will be disproportionately true for Black and Latino borrowers,&quot; Jesse Van Tol, the president and CEO of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, told NPR.Eliminating a minimum credit score and examining payment history will also help families who have student loan or medical debt, but are generally responsible borrowers, he said.Van Tol foresees both of these strategies helping communities that have historically been starved of capital and credit.&quot;It will help many Black and Latino borrowers and I think it will also help many lower income white borrowers,&quot; he added. &quot;That&#x27;s a good thing.&quot;Black and Latino neighborhoods need investment to increase value of homes and ensure wealthThe program&#x27;s homebuyer certification course is designed to demonstrate an applicant&#x27;s ability to meet current obligations and create a budget roadmap in sustaining their homeownership in the future, according to a Bank of America spokesperson.But Payne, from Rebuilding Together, said that&#x27;s not enough. &quot;The first-time homebuyer course may help in developing knowledge around saving and maintenance, but we also recognize that there are things that are beyond that initial savings, like unexpected expenses, critical home repairs, disaster recovery,&quot; Payne said.She added that for the program to be a long-term success, there needs to be greater investment in the targeted neighborhoods at large. &quot;Having resources in the community beyond the homes, like community spaces, organizations, and quality schools — all of those pieces tie into realizing the benefits of homeownership and helping folks build resilience for challenges that may come,&quot; Payne said.

He has been artistic director at Semperoper Ballett in Dresden for the last 16 years and previously danced with William Forsythe’s Ballett Frankfurt, Dutch National Ballet and National Ballet of Canada. He danced with ENB for two seasons 30 years ago and it’s an experience that stuck with him. “I love the pioneering spirit of ENB. You really become a family.

All eyes were on the director as she faced the world’s press ahead of the film’s premiere – and after days of controversy involving Shia LaBeouf’s withdrawal from the project and Florence Pugh’s reluctance to take part in any press tours.But the rumour mill was swiftly stifled after Wilde repeated the party line that everything was totally fine, and the festival’s press conference moderator shut down any further awkward questions. “Florence is a force; we are so grateful she is able to make it tonight [to the premiere] despite being in production,” Wilde said in response to a question about Pugh’s absence. “As for the endless tabloid gossip and noise out there, the internet feeds itself. I don’t feel I need to contribute to it.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "In the nearly 70 years since the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark anti-segregation ruling in&nbsp;Brown vs. Board of Education, America’s K-12 and higher education settings have become more richly diverse. However, the same is not always true of American preschool classrooms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn fact, a&nbsp;2019 report&nbsp;from The Urban Institute found that American preschool classrooms are more than twice as likely as their kindergarten and first-grade counterparts to be nearly 100 percent Black or Hispanic in their student composition.\n\n\n\nWhat is behind this unexpected segregation? The answers are complex, but one key driver is public policy. Ironically, state and federal preschool investments — often enacted in the name of improving equitable outcomes — may be inadvertently contributing to increased segregation through enrollment prioritization, not only by race and ethnicity but across socio-economic and other key demographics.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn collaboration with Education Trust, Century Foundation and Educational Alliance’s Manny Cantor Center, our team at The Hunt Institute has been hard at work in recent months exploring both the values of diversity and inclusion in preschool and the ways that policymakers can better support the robust integration of early childhood settings.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResearch has found&nbsp;that diverse and inclusive settings positively impact children's development across multiple domains, including their social, emotional and cognitive development. When children are exposed to diversity from an early age, they acquire stronger social and emotional skills and increase their awareness and understanding of diverse perspectives and cultures. Inclusive settings can encourage greater acceptance of others and help prepare children to navigate and succeed in an increasingly diverse world.\n\n\n\nEconomically diverse classrooms help bridge achievement gaps and stimulate cognitive and social growth for all children in the classroom. In economically integrated classrooms, preschool children with both lower and higher socioeconomic statuses gain greater language skills. Research conducted with school-aged children has found that when children are in integrated and diverse settings, they show growth in test scores, are more likely to enroll in college and are more creative and innovative in their thinking.   \n\n\n\nDiverse educational settings also have economic and societal benefits. Studies have shown children in diverse classrooms are prepared to be global citizens and succeed in a global economy, have access to more equitable resources and are likely to earn more as adults and have an improved quality of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith a wealth of evidence suggesting the benefits of classroom diversity, what can policymakers do to better support such classrooms? A key first step may involve taking a cue from the oath sworn by physicians: “First, do no harm.”\n\n\n\nThe nation’s preschool investments, from Head Start and childcare subsidies, to state-funded prekindergarten, are almost exclusively targeted toward low-income children — resulting in a greater prevalence of racially, ethnically and socioeconomically homogeneous settings, especially in geographic areas where these populations may already be significant. While universal programs open to all children would almost certainly eliminate some of these concerns, so too may less costly public policy approaches designed to address them thoughtfully and proactively.\n\n\n\nThe intentional use of&nbsp;mixed delivery&nbsp;approaches through which income-eligible children are funded to participate in both public and private preschool classrooms alongside tuition-based and otherwise ineligible peers is an idea gaining traction in prekindergarten programs across the nation.\n\n\n\nLikewise, state and federal policymakers must be mindful not to create such rigid program and funding criteria that their expectations can only be met in stand-alone classroom settings. Instead, agency leaders should be undertaking the hard work of aligning and (as necessary) deconstructing program requirements to allow preschool providers maximum flexibility to integrate classrooms through the blending and braiding of multiple revenue sources.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese are just a few of the recommendations included in a new report,&nbsp;“Strong Foundations: Promoting Diverse and Inclusive Preschool Settings,” released this month by our coalition of partner organizations, with support from Trust for Learning. We invite you to read the full report and share it with the policymakers and early education leaders within your networks.\n\n\n\nWith deliberate and proactive approaches, policymakers can extend the benefits of diversity and inclusion to all preschool students. The time to do so is now.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;Javaid Siddiqi, Ph.D., is president &amp; CEO of The Hunt Institute, an education policy resource to the nation’s governors, state lawmakers and senior state elected leaders based in Cary, NC.&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/3629734-rising-numbers-of-americans-concerned-about-political-violence-poll/",
        "description": "Sixty-four percent of Americans believe the United States will see an increase in political violence over the next few years, a figure that has steadily risen in recent months, according to a new CBS News-YouGov poll.\n\n\n\nJust over half of Americans — 51 percent — expected an increase in political violence when the question was asked in January 2021. Fifty-seven percent said the same in December, meaning the new poll marks the first time that more than 6 in 10 Americans expressed an increased expectation of political violence.\n\n\n\nJust 10 percent of respondents in the newest iteration of the poll said they expected a decrease in political violence in the next few years, while 26 percent said they didn’t expect the level to change.\n\n\n\nThe increasing trend comes in the months following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot in which hundreds of people stormed the building to contest President Biden's victory in the Electoral College. \n\n\n\nBeyond the Capitol riot, threats of political violence have become a somewhat regular occurrence on fraught national issues. \n\n\n\nA man was arrested outside Justice Brett Kavanaugh's home in June in the days leading up to the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade. Threats against federal law enforcement have increased in recent weeks after the FBI searched former President Trump's Florida home.\n\n\n\nDespite increasing expectations of political violence, a significant majority — 86 percent — said force or violence is always unacceptable to achieve political goals. Fourteen percent said it can be acceptable if they feel it is necessary.\n\n\n\nThe poll also found Americans have pessimistic views about the levels of democracy and civility in the country.\n\n\n\nFifty-four percent of respondents said they think the United States will be less of a democracy a generation from now, compared to 19 percent who indicated they think the country will be more of a democracy.\n\n\n\nAttempting to reverse low approval ratings bogged down by issues like inflation, President Biden in recent days has increasingly framed the upcoming midterm elections as a referendum on democracy, portraying Trump and “MAGA Republicans” as a threat to the republic.\n\n\n\n“Not every Republican, not even a majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology,” Biden said during a primetime address in Philadelphia on Thursday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“But there’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country,” he added.\n\n\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has continued to focus on his unfounded claims of voter fraud in public appearances.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring a Saturday campaign rally in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, he called Biden an “enemy of the state” and referred to the FBI and Justice Department as “vicious monsters” after they searched Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence.\n\n\n\nThe new poll found that 8 in 10 Americans think the level of civility in American politics in recent years has gotten worse, while just 7 percent said it has gotten better. Twelve percent said they hadn’t seen a change in civility.The poll was conducted from Aug. 29-31 with a sample of 2,085 U.S. adults. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.",

        "description": "Photo by Eric Espada/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Three opponents in three cities were on the docket for the Dodgers, who used seven starting pitchers in seven games, winning four. They gained one starter back in Clayton Kershaw, but lost Tony Gonsolin to the injured list. Simiarly, Blake Treinen is back after over four months away, but Brusdar Graterol and David Price got hurt, too. \nWelcome to September, the time for sorting things out for October.\nBatter of the week\nJustin Turner continued his months-long hot streak, hitting .500 last week with five doubles and a home run.\nPitcher of the week\nSeven different Dodgers started this week, giving us a large quantity of possible candidates. We’ll go with Tyler Anderson, even in a loss. He pitched seven innings and kept the Dodgers in a game that Jacob deGrom was dominating on the other side. Anderson walked none for the ninth time this season, the team innings leader lasted at least seven innings for the eighth time.\nWeek 22 results\n4-3 record33 runs scored (4.71 per game)24 runs allowed (3.33 per game).642 pythagorean win percentage\nYear to date\n92-41 record716 runs scored (5.38 per game)422 runs allowed (3.17 per game).725 pythagorean win percentage (96-37)\nMagic number: 9 to clinch the NL West\nMiscellany\nRare lopsided loss: One-run wins are talked about often, but great teams tend to beat the hell out of others. The Dodgers qualify, having outscored their opponents, on average, by more than two runs per game. Baseball Reference defines blowout games as decided by five or more runs, and the Dodgers are 35-6 in such games, the most blowout wins and tied for the fewest blowout losses. The first five of those defeats came by exactly five runs, which made Friday’s 7-1 loss to the Padres even more notable.\n\n\nThe @Dodgers lost to the Padres 7-1 tonight, snapping LA's streak of 228 consecutive regular-season games without losing by more than 5 runs.That streak was 80 games longer than any other such streak in MLB history (next longest: 148 by Pirates from 1979-80).— Stats By STATS (@StatsBySTATS) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nAssuming the position: Hanser Alberto pitched the final inning of that loss on Friday, but then on Saturday pitched in a more familiar role of closing out a blowout win. Saturday was Alberto’s eighth pitching appearance this year, the record for a position player in a season. Position player pitching is a regularity now, with expanded bullpens somehow always in need of constant saving. A position player can’t enter a game to pitch unless the teams are separated by at least six runs, and the typical usage — 97 of 113 such appearances this year — is mopping up a loss. But of the 16 position-player pitching games to come in a win, seven are by Hanser Alberto, the finisher. On Saturday, he not only tripled earlier in the game after taking over at third base, but also struck out Josh Bell in the ninth inning for his first career strikeout. Alberto is the first Dodgers reserve to hit a triple and strike out someone from the mound since Larry Sherry on July 9, 1960.\nDouble your pleasure: The first of two Justin Turner doubles on Friday gave him 30 on the year, his fifth career 30-double season. On Sunday, Mookie Betts — in the same week he set a new career high with 33 home runs — hit two doubles as well, the first of which giving him 30 doubles for the sixth time. Ending the week, Turner has 32 doubles and Betts 31, to go with Freddie Freeman’s MLB-best 43 doubles and 34 by Trea Turner. It’s the seventh time the Dodgers have at least four players with 30 doubles in a season, and the first time since 2014. The club record is five players with 30-plus doubles, set by Brooklyn in 1931. The Dodgers lead the National League with 279 doubles, on pace to set club record for doubles in a season (312, in 2017) and doubles per game (1.97, in 1930).\nTransactions\nMonday: Tony Gonsolin was placed on the IL with right forearm inflammation, and Michael Grove was called up for a spot start in Miami.\nTuesday: Grove was optioned, as was Phil Bickford. Heath Hembree was selected and Jake Reed recalled from Oklahoma City, and proceeded to get the win and save, respectively, in the series opener in New York. For Reed, it was his first major league save.\nThursday: Clayton Kershaw was activated off the IL to start the finale against the Mets, and Miguel Vargas was called up as rosters expanded from 26 to 28 players.\nThursday: Brusdar Graterol was placed on the IL with right elbow inflammation, after pitching only four games since returning from a previous six-week IL stint with shoulder inflammation. Bickford made a quick return.\nFriday: Blake Treinen was activated off the 60-day IL after missing 4½ months with shoulder inflammation. Reed was designated for assignment.\nSunday: David Price landed on the 15-day IL with left wrist inflammation, and Ryan Pepiot was recalled to pitch bulk innings on Sunday.\nGame scores\n\nMonday: Dodgers 3, Marlins 2 (10 innings)\n\nTuesday: Dodgers 4, Mets 3\n\nWednesday: Mets 2, Dodgers 1\n\nThursday: Mets 5, Dodgers 3\n\nFriday: Padres 7, Dodgers 1\n\nSaturday: Dodgers 12, Padres 1 \nSunday: Dodgers 9, Padres 4\n\n\n\n\nPrevious weekly reviews: Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 | Week 5 | Week 6 | Week 7 | Week 8 | Week 9 | Week 10 | Week 11 | Week 12 | Week 13 | Week 14 | Week 15 | Week 16 | Week 17 | Week 18 | Week 19 | Week 20 | Week 21\nUp next\nThe Dodgers run the Terry Kennedy gauntlet, hosting the Giants for three games, including an afternoon start on Wednesday, followed by another weekend series against the Padres, this time in San Diego.",

        "description": "Photo by Denis Poroy/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Snakes will get a bite of the Brewers v2.0 I am stepping in to do several previews that would have otherwise been written by the witty Jack Sommers, so don’t slam me for the lack of professionalism in this write up. Besides, you know who I am. :)\nPadres = Brewers?\nThe last time we played the Padres was before the trade deadline. We got swept at Petco Park...no, wait! We actually won a game, because Merrill Kelly &gt; Mike Clevinger. And Melancon got a save. Ha! You didn’t see that coming!\nIt was the last game before the All Star game and ever since, the Diamondbacks, who were at 40-52 then, have gone 24-17. The Padres have had a similar schedule as the Diamondbacks since our last matchup and have gone a similar 22-19. \nAlthough our division rivals are in a play-off spot, ever since losing this weekend’s series against the unbeatable Dodgers, they are 19 games behind the division leaders. However, despite losing the last series, they have a bit more of a comfortable lead in the Wild Card race thanks to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Currently, they are 3 games ahead of the Milwaukee Brewers and 1⁄2 a game in front of the Phillies. Of the teams in a wild card spot (Braves or Mets, Padres and Phillies), the Padres have the worst run differential. All in all, despite the still positive performance, many, and probably the Padres themselves included, would have expected much more from this team, especially after the trade deadline where they went big.\nWe probably know what their strength is: their loaded rotation. The Padres are league leaders (just behind the Astros) in Quality Starts, although that isn’t translated into a strong W-L% for their starting pitching. The rotation is pretty much carried by their ace Joe Musgrove and Yu Darvish. Their relief pitching is good, but the bullpen carries a total number of holds similar to the D-Backs’ bullpen. Something is missing...\nThe bats are missing. Their OPS+ is middle of the pack, but their SLG% is bad, even worse than the Diamondbacks. They are one of the league leaders in walks though, which is basically what is saving their OBP, but they obviously don’t move many of those batters over to home plate. In order to become the dominating team they want to be, the Padres need to hit better and harder so they can score more runs that way. Don’t you love the simplicity of baseball?\n  \n        \n      Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n      “Wow, that DBE guy is really smart” - image and thoughts of Torey Lovullo after reading this article\n\n  \nPadres’ major roster movements since our last match up.\n\nAcquired Juan Soto from the Washington Nationals. For the Padres Soto has continued his MVP performance and he leads a powerful 2-3 combo with Manny Machado.\nAcquired closer Josh Hader from the Brewers. So far Hader has gone from bad to worse since moving to San Diego, giving up 12 runs in less than 6 innings.\nAcquired Josh Bell from the Washington Nationals. Bell has gone really cold since coming over from Washington, hitting just .181 although he still draws a fair amount of walks.\nAcquired Brandon Drury from the Reds. Drury has been striking out in almost a quarter of his appearances and hitting somewhat over the Uecker line.\nActivated Robert Suarez from the 60-day IL. The hard throwing Venezuelan has performed well since his return early August although he recently gave up 3 runs in one inning of work.\nGot rid of Eric Hosmer.\nGave up MacKenzie Gore in the Soto trade.\nLost Fernando Tatis Jr. to a couple of lists and he is out for the season and the beginning of the next one.\n\nThe Padres recalled infielder Matt Beaty and right-hander Reiss Knehr from their Triple A as September call-ups and have Drew Pomeranz (since the beginning of the season) and catcher Jorge Alfaro on their IL, so nothing noteworthy there.\n  \n        \n      Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images\n      “Wait, did they really say ‘nothing noteworthy’ on the AZSnakePit?” - image and thoughts of AJ Preller after reading this article\n\n  \nThe matchups\nBefore even looking at the different pitching matchups, I will go bold here and say that on the offensive side Juan Soto and Manny Machado are a league above all other hitters in this series, but other than them I would take almost anyone (except Perdomo) of our hitters over any friar.\nThe difference in this series will be the pitching performance. Obviously in close games we will probably get screwed in at least one of the three games by our bullpen (count on that, please, it will save frustrations), and thus it will depend on the different pitching matchups if we can rob this play-off team a win. \nGame #1 Mon 09/05 3:40 MST, Ryne Nelson (ARI) vs Blake Snell (SDP)\n\nRyne Nelson. For Reno: 5.43 ERA, 1.390 WHIP, 3.1 BB/9, 8.5 K/9.\nBlake Snell. 3.87 ERA/3.09 FIP, 1.323 WHIP, 4.0 BB/9, 12.0 K/9.\n\nJames wrote an excellent article on Nelson, so nothing to add there. \nIf there is one game the D-Backs can win in San Diego, then it will be the first one in the series. Blake Snell has performed like a mid-rotation pitcher and has fared okay in that. Biggest issues this year are short outings (as ever, he never makes it past 6 innings) and few scoreless in those (3 in 19 games). He still has troubles limiting the walks although not as bad as last season. Snell bounced back in his latest outing against the Giants, going 6 scoreless, but was hit hard in Cleveland the week before giving up 6 runs in 3.1 innings, his shortest outing of the season.\nHe was supposed to start the game against the D-Backs on April 10, but couldn’t make it because of an injury, so the last time D-Backs batters squared off against him was in August 2021. That way, basically half of our current team hasn’t seen him yet. \nThe splits are real with Snell, limiting lefties to a .182 BA while right-handed batters have achieved a .702 OPS, so expect the D-Backs to deploy more RHB than normal in Monday’s game.\nWe should be able to see within the first 4 innings if we are able to win the game and obviously we will depend a lot on how Nelson faces the task of pitching to some fearless ‘papis’. But I am sending some positive vibes here and say we take this, putting my confidence in our newest member of the major league squad.\n  \n        \n      Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images\n      “Darn, they are on to me...” - image and thoughts of Blake Snell after reading this article\n\n  \nGame #2 Tue 09/06 6:40 MST, Merrill Kelly (ARI) vs Joe Musgrove (SDP)\n\nMerrill Kelly. 2.84 ERA/3.09 FIP, 1.105 WHIP, 2.6 BB/9, 7.8 K/9.\nJoe Musgrove. 3.01 ERA/3.38 FIP, 1.038 WHIP, 1.9 BB/9, 9.0 K/9.\n\nYou don’t get a matchup much better than this one if you are planning on watching a D-Backs vs Padres game. The difference between Kelly and Musgrove is that our man is able to limit the hard contact better than Musgrove. This pitching matchup could go either way and will probably decide who wins the series.\nHowever, in the last 7 games Musgrove has encountered troubles, giving up 21 runs in 41 innings. Musgrove has gone 1-3 in those games and was bailed out by the offence in a game in Kansas where he gave up 5 runs in just 3.2 innings. The right-hander is faring better against LHB than RHB, although just minimal, so we probably won’t see the D-Backs betting on that.\nNope, our cards will be on Merrill Kelly and hoping he is able to go many innings to limit the possibilities of yet another bullpen meltdown. \nGame #3 Wed 09/07 5:40 MST, Tommy Henry (ARI) vs Yu Darvish (SDP)\n\nTommy Henry. 4.83 ERA/4.60 FIP, 1.484 WHIP, 4.5 BB/9, 6.5 K/9.\nYu Darvish. 3.26 ERA/3.27 FIP, 0.971 WHIP, 1.7 BB/9, 9.0 K/9.\n\nHenry was smashed to Philly steak in his latest outing and will be looking to bounce back and give his ERA a prettier face. He’ll face the tough task of keeping up pace with Darvish who comes off a 7 inning win last Friday, in the series opener against the Dodgers, whom he held scoreless and allowed just 2 hits.\nDarvish has already faced us three times this season, achieving 2 wins and a non-decision, being the non-decision a 6 innings no hitter. Walker and Marte have good numbers against Darvish, so the Diamondbacks are definitely not without a chance here but will need to perform at their best to be able to come on top in what will probably be the toughest game of the series to win.\nHere’s to good luck and let’s go D-Backs!",

But here we are, on Labor Day, with Rocco Baldelli’s squad tied with the suddenly-scuffling Cleveland Guardians atop the AL Central.\nDespite a three-game skid that culminated with a 13-0 drubbing at the hands of the White Sox on Saturday night, the Twins managed to avoid a sweep in Chitown on Sunday while Cleveland continues their sudden and ongoing slide as losers of five straight and eight of their last 10.\nHowever, things get easier for the Guardians as they head to Kansas City to take on the Royals while the Twins are in the Bronx to face the Yankees. Yes, the Yankees are already an 80-win club and were easily the best team in baseball at the All-Star Break, but they’ve dropped six of eight and just lost Andrew Benintendi to a broken wrist.\nThe Twins will send Chris Archer to the bump for his usual five innings, while New York will counter with Jameson Taillon (12-4, 3.97 ERA). Taillon exited his last start after being hit with a line drive, but thankfully X-rays were negative and it was ultimately diagnosed as a forearm contusion.\nThe strikeout numbers are way down this year for Taillon but he’s still been largely effective, and a Twins lineup that still is without Byron Buxton and Jorge Polanco will need to be on their game if they’re going to get a Labor Day win at Yankee Stadium.\n\nToday's Lineups\n\n\n\n\nTWINS\nYANKEES\n\n\n\n\nLuis Arraez - DH\nGleyber Torres - 2B\n\n\nCarlos Correa - SS\nAaron Judge - CF\n\n\nMax Kepler - RF\nGiancarlo Stanton - DH\n\n\nJose Miranda - 1B\nJosh Donaldson - 3B\n\n\nNick Gordon - 2B\nJose Trevino - C\n\n\nGio Urshela - 3B\nOswaldo Cabrera - RF\n\n\nJake Cave - LF\nIsiah Kiner-Falefa - SS\n\n\nGary Sanchez - C\nTim Locastro - LF\n\n\nGilberto Celestino - CF\nMarwin Gonzalez - 1B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Archer - RHP\nJameson Taillon - RHP",

        "description": "President Joe Biden&#x27;s student loan forgiveness plan could lift crushing debt burdens from millions of borrowers, but the tax man may demand a cut of the relief in some states.That&#x27;s because some states tax forgiven debt as income, which means borrowers who are still paying down student loans could owe taxes on as much as $10,000 or even $20,000 that was taken off their bill. In Mississippi, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arkansas and North Carolina, forgiven student loans will be subject to state income taxes unless they change their laws to conform with a federal tax exemption for student loans, according to a tally by the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.That dismays Cathy Newman, a Louisiana State University graduate who just took a job teaching freshman biology at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg. She figures she could end up owing a few hundred dollars of money that she could have kept had she stayed in Louisiana.Newman said she can come up with the cash because she has a good job, but she knows of a lot of other borrowers who will still be stuck in difficult financial positions even with their loans forgiven.“If they stay in the state, they could end up with a pretty hefty tax burden if things don&#x27;t change,” Newman said. “I won&#x27;t be happy if I have to do it. I can do it. But a lot of people can&#x27;t.”More than 40 million Americans could see their student loan debt cut or eliminated under the forgiveness plan Biden announced late last month. The president is erasing $10,000 in federal student loan debt for individuals with incomes below $125,000 a year, or households that earn less than $250,000. He’s canceling an additional $10,000 for those who also used federal Pell Grants to pay for college. But it only applies to those whose loans were paid out before July 1, which leaves out current high school seniors and students who will follow them.Although having $10,000 or $20,000 in loan payments eliminated will be a boon over the long term to borrowers who qualify, those in the affected states might be required to declare that as income. Depending on a state&#x27;s tax rates, the taxpayer&#x27;s other income and the deductions and exemptions they&#x27;re able to claim, that could add up to several hundred extra tax dollars that they&#x27;ll owe.Spokespeople for tax agencies in several states — including Virginia, Idaho, New York, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Kentucky — told The Associated Press that their states definitely won’t tax student loans forgiven under Biden’s program. Revenue officials in a few other states said they needed to do more research to know.Newman, 38, went into debt to pay for graduate school. She had already set herself up for relief under the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, though that requires five more years of teaching on top of the five she already taught at the University of Louisiana Monroe. Biden&#x27;s program would cut $10,000 off her debt load when it takes effect, but under existing Mississippi tax law, the relief won&#x27;t come free.“It&#x27;s not a huge burden for me, but it could be for a lot of other people, which is what I&#x27;m worried about, especially if it&#x27;s unexpected, and I think a lot of people don&#x27;t realize that,” Newman said.Any relief in states that would tax the forgiven debt would have to come from their Legislatures. Leaders of the Minnesota Legislature and Democratic Gov. Tim Walz have indicated in recent media interviews that there&#x27;s broad support for a fix, which could come during the 2023 session, or even earlier on the remote chance of a special session.In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration plans to propose a fix in the state budget next year, but that would have to be approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature. And Evers needs to get reelected in November before he can formally make that request. Republican legislative leaders and Evers&#x27; GOP challenger, Tim Michels, did not reply to messages seeking comment on the student loan tax issue.However, in Mississippi, the chairman of the state Senate committee in charge of taxes said he&#x27;s willing to take a look when the Legislature convenes next year. Republican state Sen. Josh Harkins, of Brandon, said he needs to learn more about what his state&#x27;s tax laws say on debt forgiveness.“I&#x27;m sure people will want to look at adjusting that or making some changes in the law, but a lot of factors have to be considered,” Harkins said, noting that Mississippi enacted its biggest-ever tax cut earlier this year and adding that he wants to gauge the impact of inflation before making big tax policy decisions. “This all just hit in the last week.”",

        "description": "Photo by Duane Burleson/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Of these four, only one or two will make the postseason. Catching up with old friends.\nJavier Báez\nWe don’t hear much about Javy, and that’s probably because his team isn’t very good. Báez has hit .294/.351/.382 (10-for-34) in nine games since the last update here, and you’ll note the relatively low SLG. That’s because only one of those 10 hits was for extra bases (a home run). The Tigers were 3-6 in the nine games. Here’s the home run [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a recent Tigers Javy giveaway:\n\n\nFirst 10,000 fans thru gates at Sunday’s Tigers-Royals game at Comerica Park get a Javier Báez lunchbox. pic.twitter.com/v4TcwsZtGO— Jason Beck (@beckjason) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nAbout two-thirds of fans got a lunchbox in Detroit that day. Attendance at Comerica Park on September 3 was 15,259.\nKris Bryant\nStill out with plantar fasciitis and hasn’t played since July 31. Update, such as it is:\n\n\n#Rockies manager Bud Black says that Kris Bryant is out of his boot (on occasion) that is helping to treat plantar fasciitis and has done some “higher intensity exercise.” There is still no timeline for his return.— Rox Pile (@RoxPileFS) August 30, 2022\n\n\n\nRockies beat writer Danielle Allentuck says:\n\n\nI crunched all the numbers and one thing is very clear: a healthy Kris Bryant won't solve the #Rockies problems. Analysis: https://t.co/aAyJz5YNvf pic.twitter.com/kTM7XUlpKj— Danielle Allentuck (@d_allentuck) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nShe’s right. And Rockies fans are not happy with this whole situation:\n\n\nIt never fails that when I buy tickets to see @KrisBryant_23 he is either injured, not playing , or not where I thought he’d be playing. WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN. I bought my rockies jersey and left field tickets     — Paige. (@PaigeGauze) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nAnthony Rizzo\nRizzo is 3-for-13 with two home runs since the last update here, but hasn’t played since August 31 with back problems. The article says:\nRizzo stayed back in California after the Yankees lost a series to the Los Angeles Angels. He was preparing to receive an injection, according to manager Aaron Boone.\n“There’s a chance that he could get an injection and probably miss this Tampa series, potentially,” Boone said.\nWhich, in fact, did happen. Which led to some humor from our SB Nation friends at Pinstripe Alley:\n\n\nAnthony Rizzo is \"available\" in the same way that all the old crap at my parents' house 200 miles away is for me https://t.co/H4w6aLYPVQ— Pinstripe Alley (@pinstripealley) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nRizzo has played in 117 of the Yankees’ 131 games this year, starting 111 of those.\nKyle Schwarber\nSchwarber is the only one of these four players who has not missed any time with injury this year. He’s played in 128 of the Phillies’ 134 games so far.\nSince the last update here, Schwarber has hit .237/.293/.421 (9-for-38) with two doubles, a triple (!) and a home run, along with 14 strikeouts. His OPS for the season entering Monday’s action is an even .800.\nHere’s the home run, hit August 29 vs. the Diamondbacks [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nThat ball went a long, long way:\n\n\n#Phillies 7 @ #Dbacks 0 [T4-1o]:Kyle Schwarber homers (36): fly ball to RF (3-run)Hit: 432ft, 105.8mph, 29° Pitch: 85.7mph Cutter (LHP Madison Bumgarner, 20)— Home Run Tracker (@DingerTracker) August 30, 2022\n\n\n\nIf you’re interested, you can see Schwarber play at Wrigley Field later this month. The Phillies will be in town for a three-game series September 27-28-29.\nThe Rockies are also at Wrigley this month, September 16-17-18, but it seems doubtful Bryant will play in that series.",

        "description": "Forced labor, sexual assault and abuse are not normal dinner-table topics for the relaxing Labor Day weekend. But, sadly, this is often part of the story behind so much of the produce that winds up on our plates in America. As Justice Department prosecutors noted this spring when three defendants in Georgia were sentenced to federal prison for human trafficking on U.S. farms, “These men engaged in facilitating modern-day slavery.” \n\n\n\nAs the co-founder and CEO of a values-focused soup company, I have preached endlessly about the need to know the “story of our food.” And although we’ve made strides in drawing awareness to sustainability in the agricultural industry, we have not paid as much attention, perhaps, to the vulnerable and often unprotected laborers who do the actual work. That no longer should be acceptable to any of us. What good is it to pat ourselves on the back for buying locally sourced organic tomatoes and onions if those vegetables were picked by farm workers who endured abusive conditions?\n\n\n\nThere are more than 1.2 million hired farm laborers in this country. They pick the tomatoes for our summer BLTs, the corn for our Labor Day barbecues, and the strawberries for our fruit cups. They do this work by hand. We’ve mechanized so much in our food system, but most crops are still picked manually by farm laborers. And these laborers are more vulnerable than ever. The number of workers in this country legally under the federal government’s H2A temporary visa program has tripled since 2012, to nearly 258,000 in 2021. This number represents less than one-quarter of the agricultural workers in this country. Unfortunately, the agricultural labor force is often subject to abuse, wage theft, and worse — regardless of their immigration status. \n\n\n\nThe statistics from the Department of Labor are staggering. Over 70 percent of the department’s workplace investigations reveal major violations, and many farms are repeat violators. A recent investigation found that violating farms owed more than $9 million in back wages to hundreds of laborers. \n\n\n\nWe, the consumers, have the power to stop this and to reform the food supply chain for good.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne group, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers in Florida, is working to end abuse in the agricultural system. These farmworkers say they have seen it all: A farm manager reportedly beating a worker simply for stopping to take a sip of water. Undocumented workers hidden inside walk-in freezers to dodge immigration officials. Women who are raped in the fields and then too terrified to report the assaults for fear of losing their jobs, or worse. \n\n\n\nThe Immokalee Workers created the Fair Food Program, a unique partnership among farmers, farmworkers and food companies to ensure humane wages and working conditions for the people who help feed our families. Many retailers have signed on to participate, including Whole Foods, Walmart and Ahold. My company, Soupergirl, recently obtained a Fair Food certification just for our tomato gazpacho line. It’s a very modest step, and we hope that much bigger companies will join us.\n\n\n\nMany Americans feel powerless to stop the seemingly endless stream of tragic events they hear about or read about in the news. But we actually can play a positive role simply by asking food brands to buy only produce that is certified as having been grown on farms that respect basic human values. This isn’t some ill-defined boycott that goes viral on social media for 12 hours and is never heard about again. Consumers can do good every time we step into a grocery store by buying Fair Food-certified produce and other products. And we can each do our part to push food companies to buy fruits and vegetables from certified farms that care about their labor force.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere’s no virtue in buying pesticide-free produce grown on farms that abuse their workers for profit. This Labor Day weekend — and all days — let’s make sure that the food we put on our tables is worthy of the decent, hardworking people who picked it for us.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSara Polon is CEO of Soupergirl, the plant-based soup and gazpacho company based in Washington, D.C.

        "description": "Why is Jerusalem lumped in with the jingoism of Last Night of the Proms? William Blake wrote a heretical, anti-establishment anthem that was later gifted to the suffragists and used to rouse fighters in the Spanish civil warWhen the South African soprano Golda Schultz walked out in front of the BBC Symphony Orchestra on 12 September 2020, she looked both spectacular and completely at ease as she prepared to sing a new arrangement of the Last Night of the Proms staple, Jerusalem. Four minutes and three seconds later, her performance had sparked a storm.The Metro headlined with a quote from Twitter, calling the event “a mangled abomination”, while the i reported that the “bluesy” remake annoyed traditionalists, who were then described as “aghast” by the Daily Mail. But even the strongest tabloid headlines were muted compared to the outpourings of disgust on social media, which attacked the performance as “an assault on the eardrums” and a “massacre” in which Schultz had “butchered” both the original music and British culture.

        "description": "Printworks, LondonAnthony Roth Costanzo’s neon-lit ‘operatic experience’ brought together Handel and Philip Glass plus dancers, a painter … and films of erotic puddingsAnother week, another foray beyond BBC Proms HQ. The latest Prom to leave the Royal Albert Hall was an “operatic experience” at Printworks London – once the largest printing factory in western Europe, and since 2017 reincarnated as a massive club and gig venue. It’s the kind of cavernous space that generates its own electric atmosphere long before any performance starts. (More’s the pity that this first Prom at the Printworks will also be the last: the entire complex is now set to close to allow for “redevelopment”.) As we stood waiting for the start in neon-shot darkness, an electronic soundscape of breathing – or perhaps it was the wind or the sea? – mingled with whispers of bafflement.Bafflement turned out to be essential to this event masterminded by countertenor and operatic uber-showman Anthony Roth Costanzo in collaboration with English National Opera. Handel arias alternated with chunks of Philip Glass, punctuated by ear-bending beatboxing by Jason Singh, all subtle purrs and rattles, clicks and pops. Short films were projected on to the walls, minutely synched to the music: a Monty Python-ish medieval knight; dogs playing (leaping in comical slow-motion for one of Handel’s heart-wrenching slow sections); an adolescent girl weeping on a runway in a desert; a surreal sequence of erotic puddings, cigarettes and sausages in lurid 1960s colour.

        "description": "Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Though overt drama is limited, a lot of specifics are still up in the air as teams trod into mid-September As we’ve mentioned in these pages before, the new playoff format has resulted in a pervasively strange feeling so far this season. With six playoff spots available in each league and an array of competitive teams not much higher than that, most of what’s going on is jockeying for postseason position, rather than postseason spots. Still, a lot of races have the potential for substantial reshuffling. Let’s take a look.\n\nNL East\nCurrent status: Mets (85-50) lead Braves (84-51) by 1.0 games.\nMets’ upcoming schedule:\n\n@Pit: Walker v. Keller (53%)\n@Pit: deGrom v. Wilson (71%)\n@Pit: Bassitt v. Oviedo (60%)\n@Mia: Scherzer v. Cabrera (58%)\n@Mia: Carrasco v. Lopez (49%)\n@Mia: Walker v. Luzardo (50%)\nSum win probability: 3.41\n\nBraves’ upcoming schedule:\n\n@Oak: Wright v. Irvin (62%)\n@Oak: Strider v. Waldichuk (65%)\n@Sea: Morton v. Ray (51%)\n@Sea: Odorizzi v. Kirby (43%)\n@Sea: Fried v. Gonzales (60%)\nSum win probability: 2.81\n\nBoth the Mets and Braves head out on the road for the week, with the Braves playing one fewer game on the West Coast. The Braves also have to visit a contender, while the Mets face some non-pushover pitching matchups but a bad team overall in Miami. Overall, it seems that by next Monday, these two teams will keep pace with the Mets picking up a half-game due to the schedule, but as we just saw with New York losing a series at home to the Nats, it’s baseball and no one really knows what kind of crazy stuff might happen.\n\nLast 2 NL Wild Card Spots\nCurrent status: Padres (74-61) lead Phillies (73-61) by 0.5 for fifth seed; Brewers (70-63) trail sixth seed by 2.5 games.\n\nPadres: 3 vs. ARI, 3 vs. LAD; sum win probability = 3.33\nPhillies: 3 vs. MIA, 3 vs. WSN; sum win probability = 3.75\nBrewers: 3 at COL; 2 vs. SFG; 3 vs. CIN; sum win probability = 5.01\n\nThe Phillies have by far the easiest slate this week, but the Brewers have a compressed schedule that they can use to really force chaos. It looks like right now, the Brewers might have Corbin Burnes and Freddy Peralta face Jakob Junis and Sean Hjelle in their home doubleheader against the Giants, which could give them a big boost. If the Padres go 4-2 given that they have to face the Dodgers, and the Brewers go 7-1, things might get feisty.\nThe Phillies appear to be in line to face Sandy Alcantara in their finale with the Marlins, but shouldn’t have a tough time of it otherwise. Then again, they’ve lost six of seven, with three of those losses coming in games where they were favored. Why are we letting any of these teams into the postseason, again?\n\nAL East and Wild Card Spots\nCurrent status: Yankees (80-54) lead Rays (74-58) by 5.0; Blue Jays (73-59) by 6.0; and Orioles (71-62) by 8.5 games. Mariners (76-58), Blue Jays, and Rays are separated by 1.0 games each for the three Wild Card spots, with the Orioles 2.5 games out of the last spot.\n\nYankees: 4 vs. MIN; 3 vs. TBR; sum win probability = 3.87\nRays: 3 vs. BOS; 3 at NYY; sum win probability = 3.21\nBlue Jays: 4 at BAL; 3 at TEX; sum win probability = 4.20\nOrioles: 4 vs. TOR; 3 vs. BOS; sum win probability = 3.01\nMariners: 3 vs. CHW; 3 vs. ATL; sum win probability = 3.13\n\nThe Yankees will have a decent chance to ensure they stop frittering away the division with a favorable home series against the Rays over the weekend, though they do have to face contenders all week. The Blue Jays seem most primed to make a move here with essentially seven easy matchups (the worst is Mitch White vs. Kyle Bradish, which doesn’t seem bad at all), though the Orioles have thrived this season by defying expectations and odds, meaning that the four-game set these teams kick off on Monday could be a very important one. Mariners aren’t in any real danger of missing the playoffs at this point, given that the AL East teams have to play each other a fair bit in September, but could see their position as the top Wild Card seed erode this week if the Blue Jays take advantage of their easy pitching matchups. \n\nAL Central\nCurrent status: Guardians and Twins (68-64) tied and 2.0 games ahead of White Sox (67-67)\n\nGuardians: 3 @ KC; 3 @ MIN; sum win probability = 3.25\nTwins: 4 @ NYY; 3 vs. CLE; sum win probability = 3.27\nWhite Sox: 3 @ SEA; 4 @ OAK; sum win probability = 3.76\n\nThis division is clearly the Sick Man of MLB this year, and not much about it looks like it’s going to get clarified this week, even with the two frontrunners set for a weekend showdown. The pitching matchups in that series (Quantrill/Bundy, McKenzie/Archer, Bieber/Ryan) aren’t really lining up to give either team an advantage, and the Twins do get an extra game relative to the Guardians to try and pull ahead. The White Sox won’t go away this week, either, given that they get to play Oakland while the frontrunners battle over the weekend.\nNon-Braves games to watch (assuming pitching matchups hold):\n\nMonday/Labor Day: White Sox @ Mariners, Lance Lynn v. Marco Gonzales. Team quality-wise this is a mismatch, but Marco Gonzales has been bad while Lance Lynn has been horribly unlucky (101 FIP-, 82 xFIP-). If the White Sox are going to stay relevant, they need to take advantage of matchups like this when they get them, even against better teams.\nWednesday: Twins @ Yankees, Sonny Gray v. Domingo German. The only favorable matchup for the Twins in their four-game set in New York. If they don’t win this one, they could be at a sizable disadvantage going into the weekend set with the Guardians.\nThursday: Marlins @ Phillies, Sandy Alcantara v. Kyle Gibson. Both starters here got trashed in their most recent outings, but it’s also the biggest impediment (other than the Phillies themselves) to the Phillies taking a lead for the fifth Wild Card spot in the NL.\n Friday: Reds @ Brewers, Nick Lodolo vs. Jason Alexander. The Brewers have the benefit of an easy schedule to get back into playoff position this week, but this matchup could be a problem given that Lodolo has been quite good, and Alexander really hasn’t. \nSaturday: Guardians @ Twins, Triston McKenzie vs. Chris Archer. Probably the most even matchup overall in this series (McKenzie has been much better than Archer but the Twins are at home) and likely the fulcrum point for how the division bounces going into the next week.\nSunday: Mets @ Marlins, Taijuan Walker vs. Jesus Luzardo. Walker has been bad since late July, Luzardo has been mostly solid. This is the Mets’ worst matchup of the week, and could be the Braves’ best chance to pick up a game, perhaps even the game they need to actually take the division lead.",

        "description": "A federal judge on Monday granted former President Trump’s request to appoint an independent special master to review materials the FBI seized from his Mar-a-Lago residence last month.\n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed objections from the Department of Justice (DOJ), blocking prosecutors from further reviewing or using the seized documents in their investigation until the special master completes their review.\n\n\n\nCannon asked the DOJ and Trump’s attorneys to submit a joint filing by Friday that includes a proposed special master candidate list.\n\n\n\nTrump has accused the FBI and DOJ of executing the search for political purposes, also claiming that some of the documents were protected by attorney-client privilege and executive privilege.\n\n\n\nThe DOJ had argued in court that a special master appointment would stall its investigation of Trump and that he did not have the authority to claim executive privilege from his time in the White House since he is no longer in office.\n\n\n\n“With respect to the Government’s ongoing criminal investigation, the Court does not find that a temporary special master review under the present circumstances would cause undue delay,” Cannon wrote in the ruling.\n\n\n\nThe FBI’s search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence on Aug. 8 came as part of a federal investigation into whether Trump violated the Espionage Act and two other statutes. Agents recovered 33 boxes containing more than 100 classified records, although the potential violations do not rely on the documents being classified.\n\n\n\nRaising concerns about privileged materials seized in the search, Trump demanded the appointment of a special master two weeks later. Cannon previously announced her preliminary intent to grant the request.\n\n\n\nTrump’s demand came as he separately pushed for the release of the unredacted affidavit that led another federal judge to approve the search warrant. That judge released a redacted copy late last month.\n\n\n\nAlongside his request for a special master, Trump also asked Cannon to order the return of the seized property from Mar-a-Lago. Cannon on Monday declined to make such a ruling.\n\n\n\n“Plaintiff ultimately may not be entitled to return of much of the seized property or to prevail on his anticipated claims of privilege,” Cannon wrote. “That inquiry remains for another day.”\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to a DOJ spokesperson for comment.\n\n\n\nAlthough she temporarily blocked the DOJ from using the materials in its investigation, Cannon said the intelligence community’s&nbsp;ongoing damage assessment&nbsp;of the documents’ storage at Mar-a-Lago could continue.\n\n\n\nThe DOJ had argued that Trump lacked standing to request a special master because his presidential records were owned by the government, not Trump himself. The judge dismissed the objection, arguing that although Trump may not have ownership of many of the materials, “genuine disputes” exist as to whether others constituted personal records.\n\n\n\nProsecutors also said Trump could not claim executive privilege as a former president against the current executive branch, but Cannon said the DOJ’s position “arguably overstates the law.”\n\n\n\nThe DOJ also argued that its filter team had already examined the materials to separate privileged documents before handing them off to investigators, so a special master would be unnecessary and cause further delay.\n\n\n\nCannon called into question the accuracy of the filtering, noting that investigators on at least two occasions were given materials they believed were potentially privileged and handed them back to the filter team.\n\n\n\n“These instances certainly are demonstrative of integrity on the part of the Investigative Team members who returned the potentially privileged material,” Cannon wrote. “But they also indicate that, on more than one occasion, the Privilege Review Team’s initial screening failed to identify potentially privileged material.”\n\n\n\nUpdated at 12:55 p.m.",

        "description": "Rising GOP star Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin will travel to Maine this week to campaign for Republican gubernatorial candidate Paul LePage, a controversial former governor seeking a third term.\n\n\n\nYoungkin, who has been rumored as a potential 2024 presidential candidate, is traveling to several states this year to boost GOP candidates. He will make a stop for a fundraiser in Lewiston, Maine, on Wednesday, The Washington Post reported.\n\n\n\nThe Virginia leader's pit stop to support LePage has drawn some scrutiny because of controversial comments the Maine candidate has made, including anointing himself as the \"Donald Trump before Donald Trump.\"\n\n\n\nLePage served as Maine's governor from 2011 to 2019 but is allowed to seek a third term under state law after sitting one term out. He was officially approved in February.\n\n\n\nLePage is taking on Gov. Janet Mills (D) in November in what is expected to be a highly competitive race. According to a May poll from Pan Atlantic Research, Mills is slightly leading LePage, 46 percent to 42 percent.\n\n\n\nLePage's governorship was known for cutting taxes, making state welfare reductions and paying off Medicare debt to hospitals. When his term finished, he said he was retiring in Florida and would not return, before changing his mind and seeking a third term.\n\n\n\nLePage is also known for making controversial comments, including racially charged ones about Black and Hispanic people, as well as saying drug dealers are impregnating White girls in the state. \n\n\n\nThe former governor has since tried to distance himself from his past, telling News Center Maine in February that he has had a \"big change\" since leaving office and wishes to bridge the divide between political parties.\n\n\n\n\"We need to find a path to have civil discourse so we can talk both sides of the argument,\" he told the local outlet.\n\n\n\nYoungkin won the Virginia governor's race last year in a surprise victory for the Republican Party that established him as an up-and-coming star.\n\n\n\nIn the coming weeks, Youngkin is also making additional stops in Georgia, Kansas, New Mexico, Nevada and Oregon to support Republican candidates ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n\n\nThe Virginia Democratic Party has submitted public records requests to view the governor's travel records, expressing frustration that Youngkin is spending taxpayer money on out-of-state races.\n\n\n\nYoungkin's office told the party the governor pays for his own political travel.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Post, Youngkin also defended his decision to travel to Maine to stump for LePage, telling reporters last week that he doesn't know of any \"racially inflammatory statements and, therefore, I’m not sure that that’s accurate.\"\n\n\n\nVirginia Democrats, who are also outraged over the LePage scandal, tweeted Sunday that Youngkin is acting \"disgraceful\" by supporting the candidate.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3628598-this-labor-day-honor-the-fundamentals-of-fairness/",
        "description": "As Americans close out our summer with a relaxing Labor Day, it is time to reflect on why fairness always matters, why wage equity is important and how greater fairness and equity can positively impact our society’s wellbeing, productivity and economic growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLet us start with fairness.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFairness is understood and valued even by non-human species. This was confirmed by&nbsp;Sarah Brosnan, a professor of psychology, philosophy and neuroscience at Georgia State University who performs a now famous experiment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe presents&nbsp;two capuchin monkeys&nbsp;with a task: hand the researcher a rock when signaled to do so. If the monkey performs, they are rewarded with a piece of cucumber. Good news for the monkey. The researcher then differentiates between the two monkeys, rewarding one with the cucumber and the second with a grape, a preferred treat. When the monkey getting the cucumber sees this unfair practice, they are enraged — they throw the cucumber down, rattle their cage and bang the floor. There is no mistaking their anger over the clear unfairness for the same task.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSince this demonstration, an understanding of fairness and cooperation has been shown in other species, including dogs, ravens and chimpanzees.  Fairness predates humanity: It has \"deep biological roots.\" \n\n\n\nResearch shows our own children&nbsp;understand fairness&nbsp;from an early age, and what academics call distributive justice.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nChildren are surprised and upset when seeing resources distributed unequally for no reason and,&nbsp;by age three,&nbsp;will state they want equality in distribution. Children will also make sacrifices to be fair and to punish those who are unfair. This is seen in experiments when&nbsp;kids reject unequal distribution&nbsp;of rewards even though doing so means they get no reward as a result. Kids will also act to correct an unfairness they have witnessed even if they are unaffected by it, which researchers call&nbsp;third-party punishment. Instead of viewing kids as selfish, miniature versions of the&nbsp;“homo economicus,” we ought to recognize them as young moral actors with quite clear views of what is and is not fair.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn Labor Day, we would do well to remember and recognize that fairness matters when we are children and when we become adults and workers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2022, I see a change in perspective, an equity reawakening post-pandemic, with millions of poorly paid&nbsp;waiters&nbsp;and&nbsp;service workers&nbsp;responding to the dangers they faced in the pandemic by demanding better pay for hard work that has historically been underpaid (particularly&nbsp;in America).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnionization and industrial action are&nbsp;on the rise.&nbsp;These workers’ reasonable demands for fairness are finally being addressed by employers competing for workers in a tight market. In July, there were&nbsp;11.2 million job&nbsp;openings. If firms and we as consumers want people to do hard essential work, then they must be compensated fairly and appropriately. Greater transparency and fairness in wages — rebalancing in favor of labor and away from capital — is long past due.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis readjustment in favor of labor will pay economic dividends. Janet Yellen, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, understands as much.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDecades ago, Yellen, writing alongside her&nbsp;Nobel Prize-winning husband George Ackerlof,&nbsp; proposed a ‘fair wage effort hypothesis’ to explain workers’ commitment and productivity in the workforce. Yellen posited that “workers have a conception of a fair wage; insofar as the actual wage is less than the fair wage, workers supply a corresponding fraction of normal effort.” People will come to work, but if they believe they are being undervalued and not being paid a fair wage for their labor, the firm’s performance will suffer.\n\n\n\nThe last decades in America have been tough for most, with more and more revenue taken by executives and firms and less going to the workers. As the&nbsp;Economic Policy Institute&nbsp;notes, productivity went up 62 percent from 1979-2020, but wages only went up 17.5 percent. Employees are not stupid. They can see what’s happening.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA disgruntled workforce will not deliver for companies and the wider economy.&nbsp;This dynamic may have been unfolding in the U.S. for many years, with persistently low wages leading to dissatisfied workers who are undervalued, who then underperform.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA partial answer to the productivity puzzle seen in&nbsp;stagnant low-wage&nbsp;advanced economies like the United Kingdom may be that post-pandemic&nbsp;wage rises&nbsp;and&nbsp;worker anger&nbsp;can slowly begin to address the fairness gap.&nbsp;By demanding more and solving the fairness gap, those employees will also likely become more motivated and dedicated. Employers, who are paying more for labor, will have an incentive to invest to further lift labor productivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe can see this cycle play out in Germany:&nbsp;higher wages&nbsp;for employees; much&nbsp;shorter work weeks,&nbsp;solid productivity; strong,&nbsp;more equitably distributed&nbsp;economic growth.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis Labor Day, perhaps the outlook for wage fairness and greater equity is better than it has been for many a year. If successful, worker demands can help lift many or most boats, rather than only the super yachts of the plutocrat class. It’s about time.\n\n\n\nStuart P. M. Mackintosh&nbsp;is executive director of the Group of Thirty.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Jameson Taillon gets the nod as the Yankees return home to the Bronx for Labor Day. The Yankees narrowly avoided a sweep at the hands of the Tampa Bay Rays yesterday, as Aaron Judge homered and scored on an Oswaldo Cabrera sacrifice fly to slip past their division rivals by a score of 2-1 yesterday in St. Petersburg, keeping them five up in the AL East. There’s no rest for the weary, however, as the Yankees return home to open a three-game set with the Twins with a Labor Day matinee. Old friends Gary Sánchez and Gio Urshela will be making their returns to the Bronx after the spring trade that sent them to Minnesota.\nJameson Taillon (12-4, 3.97 ERA, 4.08 FIP) gets the ball for the Yankees. It truly has been a tale of two seasons for the right-hander, who had been a veritable ace through his first 10 starts of the season (6-1, 2.30 ERA, 2.86 FIP, 44:5 K:BB) and an absolute disaster since the middle of June (6-3, 4.96 ERA, 4.92 FIP, 70:18 K:BB). The turning point? A four-inning outing against the Twins on June 7th in which he gave up four runs on nine hits. Hopefully, today’s start will be another turning point, as the Yankees desperately need him to pitch like his April and May self down the stretch.\nAdditionally, Taillon will make his start just five days after suffering a wrist contusion that forced him from the ballgame after getting hit by a line drive against the Angels last week. Although he appears to be healthy, that is something to keep an eye on today.\nFor their part, the Twins will send out Chris Archer (2-7, 4.52 ERA, 4.29 FIP). Although Archer’s stat line may not be pretty, looks can be deceiving. The former Rays ace was absolutely electric against the Yankees earlier this season, limiting them to just one run on two hits in five innings of work. Considering that happened on June 8th — also known as the time when the Yankees lineup had a pulse — there’s reason to be cautiously pessimistic about a matchup that, at least on paper, looks like the perfect opportunity for the Yankees to get back to their hitting ways.\nTo attempt to get back on track for the 20th time in a row, manager Aaron Boone has constructed ... well, it’s a lineup, that’s what I can say. Aaron Judge returns to the two-hole, manning center field. Before that, things get dicey, with Gleyber Torres leading off for the third time this year. After that, things also get dicey, with the slumping Giancarlo Stanton and Josh Donaldson being followed by Jose Trevino, Oswaldo Cabrera, and a trio of batters who have combined for four extra-base hits since the start of August.\n“Here’s the clicker.

        "description": "No, Gunnar, we’re clapping for YOU. | Photo by Mitchell Layton/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Orioles probably need to go 6-3 or better against the Jays to have postseason hopes. They already lost one today. Orioles Game 2 lineup\n\nCedric Mullins - CF\nAdley Rutschman - DH\nAnthony Santander - RF\nRyan Mountcastle - 1B\nGunnar Henderson - SS\nRamón Urías - 3B\nRougned Odor - 2B\nKyle Stowers - LF\nRobinson Chirinos - C\n\nJordan Lyles had been scheduled to start today. However, he was pushed back from Game 1 due to being under the weather, according to manager Brandon Hyde. Keegan Akin has taken the mound for the second game instead.\nBlue Jays Game 2 lineup\n\nGeorge Springer - DH\nVladimir Guerrero Jr. - 1B\nBo Bichette - SS\nMatt Chapman - 3B\nTeoscar Hernández - RF\nCavan Biggio - 2B\nRaimel Tapia - LF\nDanny Jansen - C\nJackie Bradley Jr. - CF\n\nJosé Berríos is set to start the second game for the Jays.\nNote: All of the below was written before the Orioles lost game 1 of the doubleheader.\nIf the Orioles are going to get from where they are right now to a postseason spot a month from now, they’re going to need to win a bunch of games. Depending on the projection system, it seems like the 87-89 win range is what they think is an average outcome for the third AL wild card spot. The Orioles have 29 games left to play and if they need to get to 88 wins, then they need to go 17-12.\nThe other thing about this is that the Orioles are chasing the Blue Jays, against whom they have ten games remaining. Two of these games will be played today. The Orioles trail the Jays by 2.5 games in the standings heading into this doubleheader. Every win they get against the Jays is going to be a big help for the wild card math. Every loss will hurt. \nWith two games set for one day, that makes today have the potential to be crucial. If the Orioles lose both, it’s not officially over, but it’s pretty much over. The Orioles would need to make up 4.5 games in 27 remaining. If they somehow win both, then they only need to win one of the next two games to come away with a win in the four-game series, and they could finish the set a half-game behind the Blue Jays, or even, with an improbable four-game sweep, a half-game ahead. \nA split would be okay, though it would still leave the Orioles with wins they need later on, now with fewer games to get them. It’s a huge day! There’s no way around it. This is exciting and nerve-wracking. The exciting part is obvious. \nThe nerve-wracking part is simple: Are the Orioles up to this huge moment? They’ve had a great couple of months to get to this point. Now we’re down to the last month and against the primary competition for the last playoff spot. They’ve been good enough to get our hopes up such that those hopes could be crushed. We haven’t felt this in five years in Birdland.\nOrioles Game 1 lineup\n\nCedric Mullins - CF\nAdley Rutschman - C\nAnthony Santander - RF\nRyan Mountcastle - 1B\nRamón Urías - 3B\nGunnar Henderson - 2B\nJesús Aguilar - DH\nAustin Hays - LF\nJorge Mateo - SS\n\nThe Orioles have summoned Mike Baumann as the extra player on the roster for this doubleheader, and they’re going to use him right away as the starting pitcher in the first game of the set. Baumann has not been up with the MLB team since June. At Triple-A Norfolk since then, he’s pitched in 11 games, with a 2.83 ERA and batters hitting .213/.287/.329 against him. That included six innings with no earned runs allowed and 13 strikeouts in his last start before this. We can all hope he is up to the task against the Jays today.\nBlue Jays Game 1 lineup\n\nGeorge Springer - CF\nVladimir Guerrero Jr. - 1B\nBo Bichette - SS\nAlejandro Kirk - C\nTeoscar Hernández - RF\nMatt Chapman - DH\nCavan Biggio - 2B\nLourdes Gurriel Jr. - LF\nSantiago Espinal - 3B\n\nAnd as if it could be any other way, former Oriole Kevin Gausman makes the start in this crucial game for the Jays. Former O’s relief prospect Zach Pop is the Jays extra roster player for the doubleheader. The Orioles have found ways to come out on top when facing great pitchers during their run over the last two months. They gotta find a way to do it again. Gausman has a 2.12 FIP for the season, and he’s picked up more than seven strikeouts for every walk.",

The painting, titled Mama Goes to Market, will be exhibited at Sotheby’s’ New Bond Street galleries later this week, before being auctioned off as part of a lot featuring pieces by Omar Ba, Theaster Gates and Ouattara Watts, among others.Nine of the works being sold as part of this year’s Contemporary Curated lot were handpicked by Skepta; the London rapper chose each piece because “they all had an African feeling about them”. “Whether they were created by African artists or not, they all share in this essence,” he said in a statement. “In one way or another, they triggered powerful dialogues with my painting too.” Notable pieces chosen by Skepta include Simon Helps, a 1986 painting by Sir Frank Bowling, and Addicktion, a portrait by British-Ghanaian painter Lynette Yiadom-Boakye.

For an upgrading in 2005-07 to enable the RFH to flourish again, the spirit of the original conception needed to prevail over the literal preservation of the structure.This shift in the attitude taken towards conservation was achieved by the architect Diane Haigh, who has died unexpectedly aged 73, and it led to a more widespread change in guidance.

        "description": "The British rapper’s first painting was inspired by African markets and was produced during lockdown in 2020Skepta is set to sell his debut painting as part of an auction he’s co-curated for Sotheby’s’ Contemporary Curated series. The painting, titled Mama Goes to Market, will be exhibited at Sotheby’s’ New Bond Street galleries later this week, before being auctioned off as part of a lot featuring pieces by Omar Ba, Theaster Gates and Ouattara Watts, among others.Nine of the works being sold as part of this year’s Contemporary Curated lot were handpicked by Skepta; the London rapper chose each piece because “they all had an African feeling about them”. “Whether they were created by African artists or not, they all share in this essence,” he said in a statement. “In one way or another, they triggered powerful dialogues with my painting too.” Notable pieces chosen by Skepta include Simon Helps, a 1986 painting by Sir Frank Bowling, and Addicktion, a portrait by British-Ghanaian painter Lynette Yiadom-Boakye.

        "description": "The residence of former US President Donald Trump at Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on August 9, 2022, one day after FBI agents conducted a court-authorized search and recovered scores of classified documents.GIORGIO VIERA/AFP via Getty ImagesU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has granted former President Donald Trump&#x27;s request for a special master to review documents seized by the FBI from Mar-a-Lago last month, temporarily stopping federal prosecutors from using those documents in their investigation into obstruction and mishandling of government secrets. The decision was expected. Last weekend, the judge said she was inclined to grant Trump&#x27;s request, and a hearing on the matter took place last Thursday. At that hearing, the Justice Department laid out its argument against the special master and signaled it was likely to appeal such a ruling. Cannon, a Trump appointee, cited in her order on Monday the need to ensure &quot;the appearance of fairness and integrity under the extraordinary circumstances presented.&quot; A special master is an independent third party, typically an attorney, appointed by the judge to review materials seized in a search for anything that may be protected from investigation by attorney-client privilege, or executive privilege as Trump is claiming. The judge also ordered the government to cease any review or use of the materials for its criminal investigation until the special master review is completed, but Cannon said the intelligence community may continue its review to determine potential national security risks from the classified material being kept outside of a secure government facility. Cannon set a deadline of Fri. Sept. 9 for the two parties to submit a joint filing with a list of proposed candidates to be named special master and a detailed proposal to establish the duties and limits of the special master, as well as a schedule for the review and compensation. Legal experts have told NPR that requesting a special master is another attempt from Trump to undermine the work of the Justice Department and question their integrity. But others have argued that it will just be another procedural loophole the department has to go through during their investigation into the documents.On Friday, Cannon unsealed a list of items the FBI seized from former President Trump&#x27;s Mar-a-Lago home during a court-authorized search last month.  Previous documents filed in court by the Department of Justice revealed that Trump was holding several classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, and the DOJ has raised questions on whether Trump and his team attempted to obstruct justice by concealing or removing some of the documents authorities wanted.\nTrump&#x27;s attorneys have downplayed the Justice Department&#x27;s concerns about the classified material found at Mar-a-Lago, saying in a filing Wednesday that there was no &quot;cause for alarm.&quot;\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "&#8220;Astronomy has enlarged the sphere of our conceptions, and opened to us a universe without bounds, where the human Imagination is lost.&#8221;\n\nOn March 13, 1781, the Solar System bloomed a new planet: The polymathic astronomer John Herschel, who would later coin the word photography, discovered Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun &#8212; an icy blue gas giant spinning on its side twofold farther than Saturn.\nThe Voyager&#8216;s farewell photograph of Uranus. (Photograph courtesy of NASA.)\nWith the help of his unstoppable sister Caroline, who had ground the lenses, Herschel had built an unexampled telescope with a magnifying power of 6,000, dwarfing all the reigning royal instruments. With it, and with his superhuman patience for observing the heavens long into the English winter nights, he didn&#8217;t so much discover the fact of Uranus as deduce its nature &#8212; it had been visible to astronomers for a long time and was even included in the preeminent star catalogue of the time, but it had always been classified as a faint fixed star. \nJust like Edwin Hubble had gasped at his telescopic realization that what was previously considered a nebula in the Milky Way was in fact a whole other galaxy beyond it, instantly changing the scale of the known universe, Herschel looked through his mighty instrument and realized that what was previously considered the fixed star of a faraway solar system was in fact another planet revolving around our very own star, instantly reconfiguring our corner of the cosmos. \n19th-century Solar System quilt designed and embroidered by Ellen Harding Baker over the course of seven years to teach women astronomy when they were barred from higher education in science. (Available as a print.)\nIn an age when the filter bubble was as thick for lack of access to information as it is today for excessive access to information, it took considerable time for Herschel&#8217;s discovery to travel from the ecstatic circle of the scientific community into the popular imagination. Chief among its driving forces was the unconventional 1786 book An Introduction to Astronomy in a Series of Letters from a Preceptor to His Pupil (public domain) by John Bonnycastle (1750/1&ndash;1821), who dedicated an entire chapter to Uranus. Nested into it is a lovely manifesto for the broader value of astronomy &#8212; and, by extension, of all science &#8212; as a tool of existential reckoning and a fulcrum for living up to our highest nature. \nEpochs before the great Holocaust survivor and chemist Primo Levi considered the humanistic value of space exploration in a divided world, Bonnycastle takes the discovery of Uranus as a canvas for the bigger picture:\nThis discovery, which at first appears more curious than useful, may yet be of great service to astronomy; the circumstance of a primary planet having been unobserved for so many ages naturally led astronomers to examine, with greater accuracy, those small stars which had hitherto been genially neglected, or only considered as of use in determining the position of the planets. And these observations have produced many other new discoveries in the celestial regions by which our knowledge of the heavenly bodies, and of the immutable laws that govern the universe, will become much more extended; which is the great object of the science, and the source from which we may expect to derive such consequences as are of practical application, and the most useful to mankind.\nJohn Herschel (artist unknown)\nThe purpose of such discoveries, Bonnycastle observes two centuries before the golden age of space telescopes and their epoch-making discoveries of other worlds around other suns, is to liberate us from the parochial perspective of self-significance that is the downfall of the human animal. Reverencing the self-transcendence of the telescopic perspective, he writes:\nAstronomy has enlarged the sphere of our conceptions, and opened to us a universe without bounds, where the human Imagination is lost. Surrounded by infinite space, and swallowed up in an immensity of being, man seems but as a drop of water in the ocean, mixed and confounded with the general mass. But from this situation, perplexing as it is, he endeavours to extricate himself; and by looking abroad into Nature, employs the powers she has bestowed upon him in investigating her works.\nBonnycastle also made a daring creative decision against the grain of convention &#8212; he punctuated the science with astronomically themed verses by beloved poets, explaining the rationale behind his choice in a passage that reads like a manifesto for the spirit of The Universe in Verse:\nThe frequent allusions to the Poets, and the various quotations interspersed throughout the work, are intended as an agreeable relief to minds unaccustomed to the regular deduction of facts by mathematical reasoning, and to enliven those parts where a simple detail of particular must, from its necessary length, become languid. Poetical descriptions, though they may not be strictly conformable to the rigid principles of the science they are meant to elucidate, generally leave a stronger impression on the mind, and are far more captivating than simple unadorned language.\nComplement with an animated poem celebrating the cosmic perspective and a poetic tribute to our search for dark matter, then revisit composer Caroline Shaw&#8217;s stunning music for the poetry of the cosmos and poet Diane Ackerman&#8217;s stunning poems for the Solar System.\ndonating = lovingFor a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the unbearable name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

When Britain’s new prime minister rose to the lectern to embrace a narrower win over Rishi Sunak than expected – narrow enough to make you wonder if he could even have won, had he played it differently – the old, slightly flat, stilted speaking manner was back.

        "description": "COVID-19 has been a cruel teacher. And the harsh lessons we’ve learned will be wasted unless we can apply them to the next disease crisis. Sadly, it’s already upon us.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ongoing monkeypox epidemic — now a pandemic by some&nbsp;definitions — has shown yet again the critical importance of investing in global public goods such as disease surveillance, diagnostic technologies and vaccine research.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut one message that hasn’t stuck is that emerging infectious diseases can pack surprises for which no amount of preparation is sufficient.\n\n\n\nWe were arguably more ready for monkeypox virus than for any other virus. Scientists have over&nbsp;50 years of experience with it. Numerous countries have been preparing for it since the threat of bioterrorism was realized with the&nbsp;2001 anthrax attacks, and we now have a monkeypox&nbsp;vaccine&nbsp;and&nbsp;treatment. The United States, the country with the&nbsp;most recorded cases&nbsp;in 2022, has direct experience controlling monkeypox on its own soil since&nbsp;2003. Dr. Dimie Ogoina, an expert in Nigeria, even&nbsp;warned&nbsp;about the possibility of monkeypox transmission through sexual contact back in 2019.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, we find ourselves at a point where public health experts (including one of us, who worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionbranch that deals with monkeypox) are concerned that the virus will establish itself in the human population for many years to come.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAll this underscores the limitations of&nbsp;the current paradigm favored by the public health sector&nbsp;to address infectious diseases after they’ve emerged rather than preventing them in the first place.\n\n\n\nFortunately, earlier this year, the World Bank&nbsp;announced&nbsp;it would create a new fund for pandemics. While its scope is still being decided, it will likely support aspects of prevention alongside initiatives to prepare for and respond to pandemics.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bad news is that influential voices don’t seem that interested in preventing the root causes behind the rise in epidemics and pandemics. Billionaire and philanthropist&nbsp;Bill Gates, for example, completely overlooks this in his recent&nbsp;TED talk&nbsp;and&nbsp;other writings&nbsp;on pandemics.\n\n\n\nSome, such as the World Health Organization&nbsp;(WHO) Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, have even cautioned against it. In June, the panel&nbsp;advised&nbsp;the World Bank that investing in prevention could “sap resources from achieving the goals of rapid identification and containment of pandemic threats that will remain inevitable despite vast resources spent in pursuit of prevention.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn making this argument, the panel ignores the science. Most pathogens that cause emerging infectious diseases (including SARS-CoV-2 and monkeypox virus) originate in animals and then spill over into people. Pandemics, and the outbreaks that lead to them, however, can be&nbsp;prevented&nbsp;through actions to reduce risk of spillover such as stopping deforestation and regulating wildlife trade.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFurthermore, focusing only on containing pathogen spread after spillover has occurred is inherently unjust because the tools of containment are simply not accessible to so many people. COVID-19 vaccines have been available since early 2021, yet only&nbsp;26 percent of Africans&nbsp;have gotten a dose compared to 80 percent among Americans and Canadians (a similar story is playing out with monkeypox). It’s also unfortunately common for emerging infectious diseases to be ignored when they don’t greatly impact socioeconomically privileged groups, as we’ve seen with HIV and monkeypox.\n\n\n\nIn the coming months, the World Bank will be defining the scope of its new fund. To achieve the fund’s goals, it is critical that this fund invest in actions to reduce risk of spillover. This will require that the Bank pursue three actions.\n\n\n\n1) It must explicitly state that a key goal of this fund is to address spillover. There are currently no major global efforts focused on spillover prevention. This is a huge gap in the global commons that carries lethal consequences. The World Bank can fix this easily while the fund is in its infancy.\n\n\n\n2) It must ensure that the animal health and environmental sectors are included as equal stakeholders alongside the public health sector. While the World Bank has made clear that the WHO will be&nbsp;heavily involved in the fund, there are no such commitments for other multilateral agencies (e.g., the UN Environment Programme, the World Organisation for Animal Health) that have as much a role in pandemic prevention and preparedness.\n\n\n\n3) It must work with countries and organizations to increase donations to the fund. So far, less than&nbsp;$2 billion&nbsp;has been committed globally, far short of the recommended&nbsp;$20 billion&nbsp;annual minimum. While that sounds pricey, it is expected that the United States will need&nbsp;$7 billion&nbsp;just to control monkeypox virus for the foreseeable future and has spent over&nbsp;$3.5 trillion&nbsp;to address COVID-19.\n\n\n\nWhat Gates and the WHO Independent panel don’t seem to get, the World Bank can get right. We need to reduce risk of spillover to prevent outbreaks before they begin alongside efforts to contain pathogen spread after spillover. This is akin to medical thinking that has broadened from a focus on treating symptoms to its current acceptance of the importance of preventative health care. Pandemics are no different — traditional public health thinking needs to evolve quickly to prevent more pandemic catastrophes.\n\n\n\nNeil M.

        "description": "Who wants to win this thing? Not I, say the three ALC contenders. | Chase Agnello-Dean/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Cleveland falls back to the pack, in a division no one wants to win We’ve been told all season long that the White Sox have an easy second-half schedule (they do) and will play better against lesser competition. \nBut we can’t get ahead of ourselves. The White Sox have played all season as if the division was handed to them in March, so we won’t make the same mistake here.\nThe following is an attempt to examine how the schedule will likely play out, updated as each series finishes up, every few days. \nI have tried to be evenhanded with these series matchups. The logic of Chicago getting swept in San Diego is that it’s a long second leg of a trip, after a demoralizing series loss in Minnesota, with the bolstered Padres fighting to host a playoff series. The White Sox also ran out of gas by season’s end in 2020 and 2021.\nWill Cleveland win five of six to end 2022? That’s tough to do, but the Royals will have much earlier cashed in their season, and the Guardians get nine games at home overall to end the year.\nThere are very few sweeps all told, so this presumes that the AL Central clubs, as bad as they are, never get too hot or too cold — until Cleveland at the end, the White Sox enjoy the hottest stretch, predicted to shoot from three games over at the end of August to 11 up heading into the home stretch.\nSo ... do the White Sox end up with the division title? \n\nHeading into the second halfTwins 50-44Guardians 46-44White Sox 46-46\n(all series are three games unless otherwise specified)\n\nThirteen series into the second half, the Guardians took a huge hit in a sweep in Cleveland against the Mariners. Cleveland is still playing better than predicted pace, but only by one game.\nThe White Sox, despite taking two of three at home vs. the Twins (as forecast) actually lost some ground against predicted pace, as the (anticipated loss) makeup game lost to rain in Cleveland last month is now set for September 15.\nThe White Sox, at this point, are depending on not one but the two teams ahead of them to fall back to them in the standings. A .500 division winner? We’ll see.\nGuardians 86-76 (+ 1 vs. prediction)Twins 85-77 (+ 1)White Sox 81-81 (- 4)\n\nJuly 22-24 predicted results White Sox split at home with GuardiansTwins split two games on the road at

        "description": "Mum was the word, as Zach Stewart (far left) pursued a perfect game on this day, 11 years ago. Third baseman Brent Morel and Stewart batterymate Tyler Flowers serve as bouncers on the bench, in case anyone gets too close. | Hannah Foslien/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Three massive games pitched by fairly mundane names 1978\nA catastrophic base-running mistake for the Twins secured a 4-3 Chicago win at Metropolitan Stadium in Minnesota, in front of 3,630 fans. \nWith the bases loaded in the bottom of the seventh and just one out, down 4-0 to the White Sox, Twins outfielder Bombo Rivera singled to center. The hit drove in Dan Ford from third base. However, Ford backpedaled home, waving José Morales around as well from second base, and in the process Morales passed Ford and touched home plate first. Morales was ruled out, the Twins scored just one run in the frame\nThe run loomed large when, down 4-3 in the bottom of the ninth with one out and the sacks packed, closer Lerrin LaGrow struck out pinch-hitter Rod Carew and got Roy Smalley to fly out to end the game.\nThe Ford mistake allowed Steve Trout to record his first career victory, in his first career start.\n\n1993\nIn a game at Detroit, White Sox star slugger Frank Thomas belted his 40 home run of the year. It marked the first time a Sox player ever hit that many in a season. Thomas’ shot came off of Mike Moore in the first inning of a 5-3 win.\n\n2011\nIn the back half of a day/night doubleheader in Minnesota, White Sox pitcher Zach Stewart fired a one-hitter, beating the Twins, 4-0. Stewart, acquired earlier in the season from Toronto, was making only his eighth career major league start.\nStewart retired the first 21 batters before Danny Valencia hit an opposite-field double to right to end Stewart’s perfect game bid. Zach would end his one-hitter with eight strikeouts. The Sox would also win the first game, 2-1, behind the strong pitching of Philip Humber. \n\n2019\nAfter getting knocked out of the game in the first inning a few days previously, Reynaldo López rebounded to throw one of the best games in his career as he threw a 7-1, one-hitter at Cleveland. The righthander struck out 11 and walked three in going the distance. \nKevin Plawecki delivered the lone hit off López, recording a two-out double in the second that right fielder Ryan Goins had a play on. A more experienced right fielder might have had a better chance at what was a tough play. The drive scored Jake Bauers from first. Otherwise, López was unhittable, retiring the last 16 batters he faced.",

        "description": "Venice film festival: Styles’s accent is intentionally dodgy, but the rest of Olivia Wilde’s unconvincing tale of dystopian suburbia does not have the same excuseFirst things first: it was unfair of everyone on Twitter to mock Harry Styles – on the basis of a single out-of-context online clip – for his wonky and unconvincing transatlantic accent in this film. There turns out to be a reason for it. Unfortunately, that reason is part of a larger wonkiness and unconvincingness in this handsomely designed but hammily acted, laborious and derivative mystery chiller. Directed by Olivia Wilde, it superciliously pinches ideas from other films without quite understanding how and why they worked in the first place. It spoils its own ending simply by unveiling it, and in so doing shows that serious script work needed to be done on filling in the plot-holes and problems in a fantastically silly twist-reveal.The setting is 1950s suburbia, or some disturbingly fabricated alt-reality version of 1950s suburbia, a glitchless picture-perfect place for a satire on conformity and patriarchy. This is a gleaming new housing development in the Californian desert, with state-of-the-art homes for families and upscale professional couples; there are retail stores and a swish country club for tennis and swimming. And everyone works for a single company with the faintly Orwellian name “Victory”, which is also the name of the town. The firm does top-secret work which employees are forbidden to discuss, and the locality is periodically disturbed by crockery-rattling mini-quakes which everyone has learned to ignore. The wives have swallowed their anxiety and thus have a glazed, affectless expression, like the Valium addicts of postwar America or those mannequins in the fake nuclear-test “doom towns” built by the US government in the Nevada desert.All our reviews from Venice 2022 Continue reading...",

Fortunately, some cultures do, such as the Māori, who use the word whānau (pronounced “fa-nu”), which loosely means “my people” and includes anyone of importance, blood relative or not. We might also remember the ancient wisdom embedded in most, if not all, cultures that it takes a village to raise a child.Damian GriffithsCheltenham, Gloucestershire• What would you call the son of your son’s partner? He already has a loving father and four grandparents, but lives with his mum and your son. I suggested a “bonus” grandson following the modern Swedish tradition.

        "description": "We recently marked six months since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; U.S. and Russia tensions are their greatest since the Cold War, and we are closer today to the brink of nuclear war than at any time in the nuclear age.\n\n\n\nThis has been real potential on two fronts for nuclear disaster in Ukraine: There have been overt threats from Russia of the potential of use of nuclear weapons as well as close-calls and attacks on the world's largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant has been shelled by Russian forces and recently was disconnected from the power grid, which is critical to maintaining the cooling of the reactor core and spent fuel rods storage. The disconnection caused the Soviet-era diesel-powered generators to activate for the first time in history. Under normal circumstances these generators have fuel to last two weeks, though it is feared that the fuel supplies may have been reduced during the war. In the absence of cooling there’s a real possibility of a meltdown releasing radiation which could then spread over the region and potentially much of Europe. Thankfully, the power was restored, but there is significant risk of this happening again as long as there is war in the region.\n\n\n\nOut of fear and to “prepare” for potential radioactive release, the Ukrainian government is distributing millions of potassium iodide (KI), “anti-radiation” tablets to prevent thyroid cancer from inhaled or ingested radioactive iodine. Thyroid cancer is a common cancer, along with many others, resulting from radionuclide exposure that can happen many years after exposure particularly in infants, children and young adults.\n\n\n\nRepresentatives of the International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) arrived at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant Thursday. After initial touring, IAEA director Rafael Mariano Grossi stated, “It is obvious that the plant and the physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times.”\n\n\n\nAny attack on — or near — a nuclear power plant is an act of terrorism.\n\n\n\nWe are closer to the brink today than ever before. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists’ nuclear&nbsp;Doomsday Clock&nbsp;was at 100 seconds till midnight (representing civilization apocalypse) before the invasion occurred, and the risk has only heightened.\n\n\n\nThere are roughly&nbsp;12,700 nuclear weapons&nbsp;in the world, of which the United States and Russia hold 90 percent. Hardly a day goes by without a nuclear threat or a reminder of the nuclear capabilities of the superpowers. This is coupled with the threat and targeting of attacks on Ukrainian nuclear power plants. Such an attack would be catastrophic in the region.\n\n\n\nRecent scientific studies have confirmed that the long-feared dangers of nuclear war are actually much greater due to the catastrophic climate effects that would follow even a regional nuclear war, potentially causing global famine. The report, “Global food insecurity and famine from reduced crop, marine fishery and livestock production due to climate disruption from nuclear war soot injection,” published Aug. 15, outlines the effects of various nuclear war scenarios, from a regional war between India and Pakistan using roughly 100 Hiroshima size weapons — half of one percent of the global nuclear arsenals — to a nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia using 4,400 weapons. In these models, global surface temperatures would drop between 1 and 16 degrees Celsius.&nbsp;This would initiate massive crop loss and a global average calorie drop of 7 percent to 90 percent depending on the scenario, lasting for years to decades. Ultimately, this would result in the death of some 5 billion people and could potentially lead to the extinction of our species.\n\n\n\nThis is a situation that does not have to be. We know how to build — and we know how to dismantle nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nEach of us can and must play a part in demanding an end to the nuclear threat.\n\n\n\nThere is a growing national coalition called&nbsp;Back from the Brink comprised of individuals and 416 health, environmental, religious and scientific organizations, 329 U.S. elected officials, 61 municipalities and seven state legislative bodies calling for the United States to lead a global effort to prevent nuclear war by pursuing a verifiable, time-bound agreement among nuclear nations to eliminate their nuclear weapons while simultaneously advocating for common sense policies to secure a safer more just future.\n\n\n\nThose policies include:\n\n\n\nRenouncing the option of using nuclear weapons first\n\n\n\nEnding the sole, unchecked authority of any U.S. president to launch a nuclear attack\n\n\n\nTaking U.S. nuclear weapons off hair-trigger alert\n\n\n\nCanceling&nbsp;the plan to replace the entire U.S. nuclear arsenal with enhanced weapons\n\n\n\nThere is also a global&nbsp;Avaaz petition&nbsp;calling on all parties to the U.N. Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)&nbsp;to urge the 10th&nbsp;NPT Review Conference happening right now to call for a ban on all fighting near any nuclear reactor, demilitarizing them, and creating a ‘safe zone’ of at least 30 km.\n\n\n\nI encourage everyone endorse and support these efforts.\n\n\n\nThe fact that the world has not seen another use of nuclear weapons since Nagasaki — either intentionally, by accident or miscalculation — is not a result of superior knowledge, technology, nuclear control policies or skill. Rather, it has been by sheer luck, as noted by former Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara. Sooner or later, our luck will run out, and the present Ukraine conflict is increasing the odds.\n\n\n\nThe only way to avoid nuclear war is by the complete abolition of such weapons. If we survive, our children’s children will ask what did you do when the world was threatened? What will be your response?\n\n\n\nRobert Dodge, M.D., is a family physician practicing in Ventura, Calif.

COVID-19 symptoms could be keeping millions of Americans out of the workforce.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEconomists and policymakers have struggled to figure out why a much lower percentage of working-age adults are in the labor force than before the pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe number of Americans either employed or looking for work eclipsed its pre-pandemic level in August, according to Labor Department data released Friday. But the labor force participation rate remains 1 percentage point below its February 2020 level, a gap roughly equivalent to 1.6 million people.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA smaller labor force hasn’t kept the U.S. from adding jobs at a rapid rate since mid-2020. The U.S. has replaced all 21 million jobs lost to the pandemic, with nearly 3 million jobs added this year alone, and brought the jobless rate down near pre-pandemic levels.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEven so, thousands — if not millions — of Americans could be on the sidelines of the rapid recovery because they’re still too sick from prolonged COVID-19 symptoms to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We don't know what proportion of people are having very debilitating symptoms with a lot of certainty,” said Julia Raifman, an assistant professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“But we know that it is happening to some people and we know that each infection seems to increase the chances of it happening,” she continued.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExperts say it’s tough to know for sure how many Americans suffer from “long COVID,” a general term for symptoms of COVID-19 that last weeks or even months after an infection.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCommon symptoms of long COVID include persistent shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue and difficulty concentrating — all of which can make work difficult in most fields and impossible in some.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRoughly 16 million working-age Americans said they had long COVID in a June survey conducted by the Census Bureau, but it’s unclear how many of them are still too sick to work.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKathryn Bach, a nonresident senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution think tank, analyzed the data and estimated anywhere from 2 to 4 million long COVID sufferers could be sidelined by their symptoms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"I don't think anyone who's seriously looking at this thinks that long COVID is not a big problem,” Bach said in a Thursday interview.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“But when it comes to the labor market impact, the specific numbers do matter and we don't have the data right now to get to those numbers,” she continued.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBach is one of several experts who say the U.S. needs to collect better data about the prevalence and severity of long COVID. She said it’s important to differentiate between long COVID sufferers with frustrating symptoms and those with symptoms so severe, they’re unable to rejoin the labor force.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA study published by the Federal Reserve of Minneapolis in July found that roughly 25 percent of those who get COVID-19 experience long-term symptoms, and one-fourth of those long-haulers reported symptoms severe enough to limit their work hours. While a majority of long-haulers remained employed, they were 10 percentage points less likely to be employed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We're about 1 percentage point overall below where the trend would suggest we are,” Bach said. \"If half of that were long COVID, and I'm not saying it is, that is absolutely impacting people's ability to hire.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLong COVID may not be the only factor keeping labor force participation below pre-pandemic levels. Many older workers who retired during the pandemic may be well-off enough to stay out of the workforce, while others with health conditions may be wary of coming back while the pandemic still poses a threat.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut experts say the U.S. must contend with a long-term increase in the number of Americans unable to work because of their COVID-19 symptoms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"We know enough to know it's a problem, right? We know enough to know that we have an historically tight labor market. Let's talk about what we can do about it,” Bach said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe pointed to ways that could make workplaces more accessible for anyone with a disability, which includes reducing stigma over asking for accommodations and expanding telework options.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRaifman added that reducing COVID-19 infections is also essential to reducing long COVID cases and making workplaces more accessible to those who aren’t infectious but are still dealing with symptoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It's a moment for leaders to invest in people and those investments have a huge return,” Raifman said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“A lot of people when they miss work due to COVID do not have enough food to eat. A lot of businesses don't have enough employees to keep the business running, so a lot of essential services ended up having high school students and National Guard members stepping in and substitutes when they didn't have enough people to run.”&nbsp;",

That’s the Hero11 Black, apparently. | Image: Becca Farsace / The Verge\n    \n\n  GoPro is reportedly getting ready to launch its next camera, but don’t hold your breath for a big redesign. Instead, according to images and specs first spotted by WinFuture, it appears the GoPro Hero11 Black will look virtually identical to the Hero10, and all the important tweaks will be on the inside.\nThe biggest upgrade sounds like a new sensor offering the “widest ever field of view on any GoPro,” which WinFuture says will be capable of 27-megapixel still images and 24.7-megapixel stills grabbed from videos. (The current Hero10 Black, for comparison, shoots 23-megapixel photos.) Video resolution doesn’t sound like it’s changing, though: the new model will reportedly still cap out at 5.3K at 60 frames per second, or 4K at 120 fps....\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "Rays shortstop Wander Franco resumed his rehab assignment yesterday, slotting in as the designated hitter for the Triple-A Durham Bulls as he attempts to return from July hamate surgery. The plan, as relayed by Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times, is for Franco to stick with the Bulls for a few more games and rejoin the Rays for their series against the Blue Jays on September 12.\nOf course, this is contingent on Franco feeling well in the coming days. He attempted to begin a rehab assignment a few weeks ago but was pulled off due to continued soreness in his hand. It seems like he&#8217;s in a better position this time around, however. &#8220;This is definitely the best I’ve felt since the injury,&#8221; Franco tells Topkin, via interpreter Manny Navarro. &#8220;That’s probably the most important thing, if he feels good where he’s at, where we’re at,&#8221; manager Kevin Cash said.\nGetting Franco back for the final few weeks of the regular season would certainly be a boon for the Rays. They are currently five games back of the Yankees in the battle for the AL East crown and sandwiched between the Mariners and Blue Jays in the Wild Card picture. The club also put second baseman Brandon Lowe on the IL last week, which further subtracted from their infield depth.\nOther injury notes from around the league&#8230;\n\nAstros righty Justin Verlander went on the IL a week ago due to a calf injury, with both Verlander and general manager James Click expressing optimism that a significant absence wouldn&#8217;t be necessary. However, Verlander probably won&#8217;t return after the 15-day minimum, Click tells Chandler Rome of the Houston Chronicle. The Astros are fortunate enough to be sitting on a record of 86-48, six games ahead of the Yankees for the best record in the American League and 17 games ahead of the Central-leading Guardians/Twins. That means the club is cruising to a first round bye and can allow Verlander to return at whatever pace is best for his health, as opposed to rushing him back for meaningful games down the stretch. Prior to the injury, the 39-year-old was having an incredible season, especially when considering he effectively missed the previous two years. He&#8217;s thrown 152 innings in 2022 with a 1.84 ERA, 26.5% strikeout rate and 4.5% walk rate. By surpassing the 130-inning mark, he has vested a $25MM player option for next year, but would likely be able to do better than that on the open market if he declined the option.\nThe Nationals placed right-hander Victor Arano on the 15-day injured list, retroactive to September 2, due to a right shoulder strain. The club hasn&#8217;t released any information about Arano&#8217;s timeline, but with only about four weeks left on the schedule, it&#8217;s possible that this ailment will end his season. He&#8217;s thrown 42 innings so far this year, his first MLB action since 2019. He has a 4.50 ERA, 23.5% strikeout rate, 6.4% walk rate and 51.6% ground ball rate. A 58.9% strand rate is probably inflating that ERA, with advanced metrics like FIP (3.71), xFIP (3.45) and SIERA (3.12) thinking he deserved much better. The 27-year-old will cross three years of MLB service time by season&#8217;s end, meaning he will qualify for arbitration for the first time.",

        "description": "Courtesy Lisa Fielding\n    \n\n  He and his band entertained Cubs fans at the ballpark for decades beginning in the 1980s. From 1982 through the middle of the 2010s, Ted Butterman’s Cubs Quintet entertained fans with Dixieland jazz during ballgames at Wrigley Field.\nI’m sad to report to you that Ted Butterman passed away last Wednesday, aged 87.\nThis 2015 article by Lisa Fielding of WBBM radio sums up well what Butterman and his band did to liven up the ballpark:\n\n80-year-old Ted Butterman says he debuted the band in 1982, a day he recalls Fergie Jenkins was on the mound and the Cubs shut out the Mets 5-0, a win for the team and for the newest addition to the Friendly Confines.\n“The first couple of games when we first started playing out here they’d never heard anything like that before, we added to the ambiance of the park, brought a smile to a lot of people’s faces even though the Cubs were losing,” said Butterman.\nSince then, he estimates he’s played nearly 3,000 games in front of the park, under the marquee, pregame and in between innings throughout the stadium.\n“We only have a minute 20 seconds to play during the game, so we have to give it our all for a minute and 20 seconds,” he said.\n\nAs you know, I sat in the right-field bleachers for many years before moving to left field after  the 2005-06 bleacher rebuild. Ted and his band used to set up near us and play between innings most games, and I got to know him a bit. Nice guy and he loved his music and the Cubs. \nI’m not entirely sure when his band stopped playing at Wrigley, but based on that article, they played music for Cubs fans for at least 34 seasons beginning in 1982. Here’s some video of Butterman and his band playing at Wrigley in 2008:\n\nRest in peace, Ted, and thanks for the memories.",

        "description": "Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  A quick review of how the Mets’ position players fared over the past week. The week started off extremely well for the Mets, as they took two out of three from the Dodgers in a hard-fought three-game series. And the Mets kept the good times rolling in their series opener against the Nationals on Friday night when they won 7-3, putting up their best offensive performance of the week. However, things took a sharp turn for the worst over the weekend, as they dropped two consecutive contests 7-1 and the offense failed to do anything productive against a mediocre Nationals pitching staff. All the while, the Braves kept winning as always and the Mets have seen their NL East lead shrink to just a single game over Atlanta. \nOverall, the offense has been in a bit of a rut as a collective for a few weeks now, with a couple of players responsible for the lion’s share of the production while most of the rest of the lineup flounders. Last week, it was Mark Canha playing the hero. This week, the trio of Eduardo Escobar, Starling Marte, and Brandon Nimmo are the only players to earn positive marks, while everyone else’s overall performance was middling to poor. \n  \n        \n  \nWe’ll start with Eduardo Escobar, who had been slumping badly and also dealing with an injury prior to this week. With Brett Baty having torn a ligament in his thumb that effectively ended his young rookie season and Luis Guillorme still on the injured list (though due back soon), Escobar is back to playing third base every day against righties and lefties alike. Luckily for Escobar, the Mets faced a lot of left-handed pitching this week, but he performed well hitting on both sides of the plate, posting a 206 wRC+ over 20 plate appearances. Half of his six hits went for extra bases, including two home runs—a two-run shot on Friday that put the Mets on the board and a solo homer on Saturday that tied up that contest and turned out to be the Mets’ only run of the game before things unraveled in the later innings. He shares the team lead in RBIs this week with four and was one of only three Mets to walk multiple times this week.\nStarling Marte was definitely the standout performer with the bat during the Dodgers series, as he continues to put up steady production week in and week out. In Tuesday’s narrow loss, Marte went 2-for-4 with a home run. The next day, Marte was responsible for knocking in both Mets runs with a two-run homer in the third inning that ended up to be the difference in the game. And then in Thursday’s rubber game victory, Marte went 2-for-3 with a walk, an RBI, and two runs scored. Marte shares the team lead in RBIs for the week with Escobar with four and holds the second-best mark in both hits (7) and wRC+ (155). He also leads the team this week in runs scored with four. \nMarte wasn’t the only one to make the highlight reels during the Dodgers series, though. Brandon Nimmo not only fared well this week with the bat, he made the best—and probably the most important—catch of his career this week, robbing Justin Turner of what would have been a game-tying home run Endy Chavez style. He pumped his fist after he landed with the ball secured in his glove in a display of emotion on the field we rarely see from Nimmo and the catch elicited a display of excitement rarely seen from Jacob deGrom as well, as the Mets’ ace raised his arms to celebrate the catch and tipped his cap in a well-deserved acknowledgement of the feat. Nimmo not only led the team in game-saving catches this week, he also led the team in hits with eight. He also scored three runs and drove in two, posting a very solid 126 wRC+ over 25 plate appearances. \nUnfortunately, the good news mostly ends here. A small silver lining is that Francisco Lindor improved over his dreadful week last week, but he still isn’t fully out of his slump. He collected six hits, which matches Escobar’s total, but unlike Escobar, only one of those was for extra bases and Lindor only scored one run and drove in one run this week. Overall, he posted a decidedly meh 94 wRC+ over 24 plate appearances, but he was one of only three Mets to steal a base this week. \nJeff McNeil also keeps getting his hits (he too had six hits this week), but had a somewhat pedestrian week overall, putting up a 90 wRC+ over 22 plate appearances. Five of McNeil’s six hits were singles; he scored two runs, drove in one run, and also walked once. McNeil had a game-tying sacrifice fly in yesterday’s game, but he also committed a rare error, which turned out to be very costly for the Mets and contributed to Carlos Carrasco’s afternoon blowing up on him. \nWith Escobar, Marte, and Nimmo getting positive marks and Lindor and McNeil having so-so weeks, there is a steep decline to the next tier of players, which unfortunately contains the still slumping Pete Alonso. Alonso shares the team lead in walks this week with three, which saves him from the poop emoji, but he had just two hits in 24 plate appearances this week, amounting to a dismal 36 wRC+ for the week. His only RBI this week came on a solo home run in the sixth inning of Friday’s victory, which was the go-ahead run in that contest. That was pretty much Alonso’s only contribution this week to speak of, which is not what you want from your primary run producer in the lineup. \nThe other player to walk three times this week is Daniel Vogelbach, but he had just one hit this week mixed in with those three walks. Vogelbach did not get as much playing time as he usually does, as the Mets faced a litany of left-handed pitchers this week. He collected the one hit and three walks and scored a run over ten plate appearances.\nThis meant that Darin Ruf had a chance to distinguish himself with much more playing time than usual, but he unfortunately did not rise to the occasion. Ruf collected just one hit and an RBI in 12 plate appearances—a -56 wRC+ and a poop emoji for mostly being a non-factor during his Mets tenure thus far. \nBoth DH and catcher continue to be black holes, just as they were before the trading deadline. Other than being the only regular besides Francisco Lindor to steal a base this week, James McCann had a mostly unproductive week again. He had one hit and scored a run in eight plate appearances. Tomás Nido’s most productive day was Friday; he had two RBIs in that game, including an RBI single in the sixth inning that contributed to that big inning after Alonso’s home run gave the Mets the lead. It was one of two hits for Nido in ten plate appearances this week. \nAfter last week’s heroics, Mark Canha has fallen back down to earth a little bit. Canha put up a 65 wRC+ in 23 plate appearances this week. He notched four hits, two of which went for extra bases. His most notable contribution this week was a game-tying homer in Tuesday’s series opener against the Dodgers, which the Mets would unfortunately go on to lose. Otherwise, he collected two hits in Friday’s victory over the Nationals. Still, Canha has been playing mostly every day, along with all the Mets regulars. \nWhich means that the Mets bench has been getting virtually no playing time. Tyler Naquin went hitless in three plate appearances this week, but did score a run. September call-ups Terrance Gore and Deven Marrero did not log any plate appearances this week, but Gore did appear in a game as a pinch runner and stole second base.",

        "description": "Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  If you can’t win the division, at least you can make a difference in who does. The Royals get the opportunity to impact a pennant race in a season where they’re just two losses away from guaranteeing their sixth consecutive sub-.500 season. That’s because they’ll host the Cleveland Guardians, who are currently involved in the best division race in baseball as there are just two games separating first place from third place and the Guardians are currently tied with the Minnesota Twins. A good race doesn’t mean these are good teams, mind you. Four teams in the AL East are all better than anyone in the Central. The Guardians, while they are currently at the top of the division, have the 14th best record in baseball. So they’re not great. Their lineup can do some work because they don’t strike out much, but they have three real power threats from top to bottom. Jose Ramirez is the obvious one, but Josh Naylor and Andres Gimenez are the surprises. Maybe Naylor shouldn’t be a surprise, but it was hard to know what he’d do coming off the leg injury. Their strength, as always, is in the pitching. Their top three starters are excellent and the back of their bullpen is nearly unhittable when they’re on and they’re on a lot. They are missing two starters, who are both on the IL, but Zach Plesac and Aaron Civale have been adequate at best. It’ll hurt to be missing the veterans, but the Guardians always come up with something.\n\n\n\n\nRoyals vs. Guardians Projected Pitching Matchups\n\nI did a podcast heading into the 2021 season and we were talking about the rest of the AL Central. One of the questions was who is the best pitcher we don’t know much about yet and I said Triston McKenzie, which didn’t look so good last year when he had a 6.38 ERA and 20.6 percent walk rate in his first 11 appearances. But since then, something clicked and he’s been outstanding. He has a 3.52 ERA and a 6.5 percent walk rate. That’s with a ton of strikeouts. He’s nasty. He throws a 92-93 MPH fastball about 57 percent of the time. It probably shouldn’t work, but it does. What’s even crazier is that he throws it in the middle of the plate. Fastballs that are roughly league average velocity or slightly below down the middle shouldn’t be successful. But McKenzie is. His curve is his big-time swing and miss pitch and it’s been fantastic while his slider has been a little bit more hittable, but can still be very good. He’s been better against lefties than righties and has bounced back from a tough June with very good pitching in July and August. And what’s so interesting is that he’s been good, but he’s been terrible with runners in scoring position. Either he simply can’t pitch with a runner on second or third or that’s something that will even out and make him even better. \nCareer vs. KC: 9 G, 7 GS, 46.0 IP, 4-2, 2.74 ERA\n\nYes, this is basically what I wrote for the Tigers series. It’ll be okay. In a way, I’m sort of glad Brady Singer unraveled on Tuesday night against the White Sox. It was easier to swallow because the Royals offense picked him up for once, but it allows the opportunity to see how he responds. We saw him not have much against the White Sox a few weeks ago and gut it out to go six. But we haven’t had many chances to see how he responds to bad results. He struggled against Houston in June and came out the next start and was just okay. The last time he failed to go five innings, he responded with nine straight starts of six innings or more. So he’s passed the tests so far, but it’ll be nice to see how he responds to this. As much as we don’t want to see failure, it’s a great test. My one concern with Singer is that he is showing some signs of fatigue with where he’s missing on his sinker, but even so, a Guardians team that doesn’t swing and miss much might be good for someone who gets so many called third strikes. Singer faced Cleveland the last time he failed to go six innings in a start and started that stretch I mentioned above, so maybe history will repeat itself.\nCareer vs. CLE: 7 G, 6 GS, 36.1 IP, 2-0, 4.21 ERA\n\nWhile Shane Bieber has been unable to recapture the magic of his 2020 season, he’s still been a fantastic starter for Cleveland over the last two years, though he did miss time in 2021. This year he’s been healthy. His strikeouts are a fair amount down, but his walks are as well and he’s giving good innings every fifth day, having gone six or more in 20 of his 25 starts and in each of his last nine. What’s so intriguing about Bieber, to me anyway, is that his fastball velocity has dropped considerably to an average of 91.2 MPH this season. And while it’s been hit a bit, it hasn’t been crushed like you’d expect. His slider, curve and cutter have been so good that he can live with that fastball, but I suppose if there was a day where he didn’t have a couple of his other pitches, it could end up rough for him. I’m not entirely sure if that’ll ever happen, though. While Bieber does have traditional splits as he goes through an order multiple times, there really isn’t a lot about his profile that says how an opponent can find success. It’s just about him having an off day.\nCareer vs. KC: 11 GS, 61.1 IP, 4-0, 3.38 ERA\n\nKris Bubic threw six innings for the first time in nearly four weeks in his last start in Chicago. He only gave up two runs on five hits, so on the surface, that’s a strong start. But he also walked four and struck out just one. After showing a propensity for getting the strikeout over his previous few starts, he now has just four strikeouts in his last three total. That’s good for just a 6.2 percent strikeout rate, which simply doesn’t get it done. While some pitchers have the issue of putting hitters away, Bubic doesn’t even seem to be getting there to have the chance to do it. He’s actually throwing a lot more strikes with a rate of 66 percent over his last 10 starts compared to a 59 percent rate in his first 13 appearances. Maybe that’s the problem. Maybe his stuff isn’t good enough to live in the zone as much as he is. The Guardians are a tough team to test that hypothesis on because even though their walk rate is one of the lowest in the league, they don’t swing and miss, which means pitches in the zone are going to get hit.\nCareer vs. CLE: 3 G, 1 GS, 3.2 IP, 0-1, 14.73 ERA\n\nThe Guardians took Cody Morris in the seventh round of the 2018 draft we know all too much about as Royals fans. As a typical Guardians prospect, he didn’t seem to be much of anything and then struck out 93 while walking 20 in 61 innings last season. He’s had some shoulder issues that have cost him a good chunk of this season, but he struck out 30 and walked six in 15.1 AAA innings this year. He made his first big league start on Friday and wasn’t good. He generally pitches in the 92-95 range with a four-seamer that can touch as high as 97 or maybe 98. He gets ton of spin and movement. He also throws a good changeup, a cutter and a curve. Command can become an issue for him because his delivery can get long at times, but he’s very difficult to hit as you can see from all those strikeouts. \nCareer vs. KC: First Appearance\n\nZack Greinke is set to make his return from the IL in this one with no rehab starts. He was pitching pretty well when he went on the injured list after he came back from his previous stint with forearm issues. In 11 starts, he had a 3.32 ERA with 39 strikeouts and 11 walks in 57 innings and was even better at home in six starts spanning 33 innings with a 1.64 ERA with 24 strikeouts and five walks. He obviously isn’t the pitcher he once was and definitely isn’t the innings-eater he once was, but he can certainly be effective with his strike-throwing and can help to give a little extra rest to an otherwise young rotation that seems to be slowing down a bit as the year winds down.\nCareer vs. CLE: 33 G, 28 GS, 170.0, 12-9, 3.55 ERA\nRoyals vs. Guardians Prediction\nI don’t like these pitching matchups, though I do like that Singer is going in this series and was pushed back. I like that for competitive reasons and I like that because it negates the advantage for one game that the opponent has on the Royals. I don’t know if the Royals did it because they wanted to play spoiler more or if it’s because Singer actually needed an extra day (which I think he did), but I like it. Still, after all that, I think it’s hard to predict more than one win for the Royals, which is what I’m going with here.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/cardinals-designate-junior-fernandez-option-dakota-hudson.html",
        "description": "As expected, the Cardinals reinstated Jack Flaherty from the 60-day injured list before this afternoon&#8217;s game with the Nationals. Righty Dakota Hudson has been optioned to Triple-A Memphis to create an active roster spot, while reliever Junior Fernández was designated for assignment in a corresponding 40-man roster move.\nFlaherty makes his return to the Busch Stadium mound for what&#8217;ll be his first MLB appearance since July 11. The right-hander left his final start before the All-Star Break with shoulder discomfort, his second extended shoulder-related absence of the year. Flaherty&#8217;s season debut was delayed until June 15 due to bursitis, and the star hurler revealed in Spring Training he&#8217;s pitched through a labrum tear in the area for years.\nIt&#8217;s been the second consecutive injury-plagued season for Flaherty, who also had extended IL stints last year due to an oblique strain and shoulder troubles. He started 15 of his 17 outings last season but has been limited to three starts in 2022. The absences certainly seemed to have a deleterious effect on Flaherty&#8217;s performance earlier this year, as he was tagged for six runs in eight innings with nine walks and only six strikeouts. He averaged 92.1 MPH on his fastball, down two ticks from his 94 MPH heater of 2019-20.\nWith a month remaining on the regular season schedule, Flaherty will get a few chances to try to recapture that form. At his best, he&#8217;s shown ace-like potential and could be a postseason weapon. He finished fourth in NL Cy Young balloting back in 2019, when he posted a sparkling 2.75 ERA with a 29.9% strikeout rate across a career-best 196 1/3 innings.\nSt. Louis holds an 8 1/2 game lead over the Brewers in the NL Central, having all but officially secured control of the division with a 25-7 record dating back to the start of August. They&#8217;re still 5 1/2 games behind the NL East-leading Mets for the second seed in the Senior Circuit, giving them an uphill battle if they&#8217;re to take hold of a first-round bye. If they wind up finishing in third place in the league, they&#8217;d host the final Wild Card qualifier in a three-game series. How manager Oliver Marmol deploys Flaherty in that set could well depend on the form he shows down the stretch. Adam Wainwright and deadline acquisition Jordan Montgomery have been brilliant and look like postseason starters, with Flaherty joining José Quintana and the struggling Miles Mikolas as options for a third start.\nFlaherty&#8217;s return bumps Hudson from the primary five. While St. Louis announced last week that he&#8217;d pitch out of the bullpen, they&#8217;ll instead send him back to Memphis to work from the rotation there. Rob Rains of STLSportsPage tweets that the club still plans to bring Hudson back to make a start on September 17th, when the Cards will play a doubleheader against the Reds. Today&#8217;s demotion allows him to exhaust the required 10 days in the minors for optioned players, although it remains to be seen if he&#8217;ll stick with the big league club in relief from then forward or immediately head back to Triple-A.\nA longtime member of the rotation, the sinkerballing Hudson has had an inconsistent 2022 campaign. He&#8217;s made 24 starts but posted a 4.43 ERA, striking out batters at a well below-average 13.5% clip. Hudson&#8217;s 52.8% ground-ball rate is still very strong, but it&#8217;s down from the 56.9% mark he posted in his best season back in 2019. He&#8217;s had a particularly rough go of things in the season&#8217;s second half, carrying a 5.52 ERA in 29 1/3 frames since the All-Star Break.\nThe demotion won&#8217;t have any impact on Hudson from a service time perspective, even if his return 12 days from now is a one-off recall. He&#8217;s already surpassed the four-year service threshold this season, meaning he remains on track to first reach free agency after 2024. The Cards would owe him a raise on this year&#8217;s modest $1.05MM salary if they tender him an arbitration contract after the season.\nAs for Fernández, he&#8217;ll now find himself on the waiver wire within the next few days. A member of the St. Louis organization since signing as an amateur free agent in 2014, he first reached the majors five years later. Fernández has bounced on and off the active roster for the past four seasons, tallying 50 2/3 innings over 47 cumulative appearances. He owns just a 5.51 ERA in that time, fanning 19% of batters faced with a very high 13.1% walk percentage.\nThe 6&#8217;3&#8243; hurler has a 2.93 ERA over 13 MLB appearances this season, but that&#8217;s been paired with the more pedestrian strikeout and walk rates he&#8217;s posted throughout his career. He&#8217;s had a tougher go from a run prevention perspective in Memphis, where he&#8217;s allowed more than five earned runs per nine through 36 appearances out of the bullpen.\nWhile Fernández hasn&#8217;t had a ton of MLB success to this point, the 25-year-0ld could generate some interest on the waiver wire. He&#8217;s averaged a blistering 98.8 MPH on his heater during his big league time this season. He&#8217;s also induced grounders on more than half the batted balls against him at both the major league and Triple-A levels. Any team that claims him off waivers could keep him in Triple-A for the rest of this season, but he&#8217;ll be out of options next year and would have to break camp with another team or again hit the waiver wire.\nKatie Woo of the Athletic first reported Hudson would be optioned.",

        "description": "Photo by Zac BonDurant/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  This isn’t the strongest group of players Atlanta has put together, but a couple of players look like they could be steals. The Atlanta Braves spent nearly their entire draft capital this season chasing pitching talent, leaving a class of hitters with little in the way of excitement. A few players have surprised us early with big performances, and despite the lackluster feeling leaving the draft there is some real potential in this crop of players.\nDrake Baldwin\nBaldwin was the first hitter taken in this past draft, going in the third round out of Missouri State. Baldwin quickly made a strong case for himself with four doubles in his first six games in pro ball, but has since faded with only one extra base hit in his past twelve games. Baldwin has made the most of being an advanced bat and has an 18.3% walk rate with Augusta, but has otherwise not been very effective. Baldwin has not shown off high level bat speed or power yet, but there is raw power in the bat and his approach overall garners high praise. \nDavid McCabe\nMcCabe, like Baldwin, started out strong with an .819 OPS over his first twelve games in Augusta. Like Baldwin McCabe’s production has since dropped off and his strikeouts have piled up more than expected. He hit his first home run the opposite way on August 16th and has shown off solid power, but he is a guy that still has question marks with regards to his ability to hit pro stuff. With every player in this draft it’s important to take these early performances with a grain of salt, and that goes double for college players many of whom are playing deeper into the season than they are used to.  \nIgnacio Alvarez Jr.\nFifth round pick Nacho Alvarez has been the most impressive player from this draft on both sides of the ball, quickly justifying his fifth round selection. Drafted as a third baseman he’s even gotten time at shortstop and made some nice plays over there to back up the prep reports of his high caliber defense. Alvarez has walked much more than he has struck out and has an approach at the plate and ability to barrel the ball that is far ahead of a typical 19 year old. Alvarez’s biggest question mark is his swing, which is geared overwhelmingly for contact and doesn’t allow him to tap into his raw strength. \nCory Acton\nActon did not make it out of the Florida Complex League this season so we unfortunately don’t have much to go on beyond statistics. He struggled in Florida with a .656 OPS and 14 strikeouts in 40 plate appearances, but expectations were never high for him as a guy who signed for just $5000.\nAndrew Keck\nKeck has not received very much playing time nor seen the field since August 14th, and in that playing time he has seen only one game at catcher. Most thought Keck would end up moving off of catcher as a professional so this isn’t much of a surprise. Keck hasn’t shown much with the bat in his short stint and doesn’t impact the ball well, though he has made consistent contact.\nJustin Janas\nStrikeouts have piled up a bit for Justin Janas so far with Augusta, but there shouldn’t be too much concern for a player that showed his ability to hit a Division I program. Matching the scouting report Janas’s biggest problem has been his lack of impact contact as in 20 games he has just four extra base hits. His swing is compact and quick and should allow him to get the barrel to the ball, but limits his power potential and will likely need to be tweaked in order for him to have an offensive profile that can fit at first base.\nEJ Exposito\nExposito came out of the gates strong for Augusta, but has been hurt by batted ball luck since along with higher-than-ideal strikeout rates. Still Exposito has been a pleasant surprise as a 16th round pick with three home runs so far in his career. Exposito attacks fastballs looking to drive them and he has the power to do so, though the ferocity of that swing may lead to some swing and miss in his game. \nKevin Kilpatrick\nAlong with Alvarez, Kilpatrick has made up part of a duo of players that have impacted the Augusta lineup. Though he has been cooled in the most recent series Kilpatrick got off to an electric start with 15 hits in his first nine games. Kilpatrick has legitimate raw power and athleticism to have some high-end projection, though his subpar pitch recognition at this stage can get him into trouble. As a 17th rounder there is plenty to like with Kilpatrick. \nNoah Williams\nAs a prep bat it was not surprising that Williams didn’t make it out of rookie ball this year, and in general he is a raw prospect that is far more projection over present. He notched just one extra base hit in ten Florida Complex League games, though his athleticism and 6’3” frame does hint at some real power projection.\nChristian Jackson\nThe other of the Braves prep bats also spent his first season in rookie ball, and his results were even worse than Williams’s. Jackson struck out 14 times in 30 plate appearances in the FCL and both prep players are more than likely going to start next season in extended spring training.\nKeshawn Ogans\nKeshawn Ogans is a player I like quite a lot in the 20th round, though I’m not exactly convinced he’s a legitimate prospect. His power limitations are real and will be hard to overcome given that his frame doesn’t present much room for growth, but he does everything else well. As cliche as it is Ogans is a gamer and a player that’s great to have in the system. He hits, defends, and runs well and could have a similar impact as a player we like in Cody Milligan. He was the first hitter from this class to receive a call up to High-A Rome and has gone 3-10 in his debut there.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3629407-2022-is-the-most-promising-labor-day-for-unions-in-several-decades/",
        "description": "This is an unusually promising Labor Day for American unions — maybe the most hopeful for many decades — for several reasons.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFirst, the annual Gallup poll released last week showed a 71 percent public approval rate for unions – the highest level since 1965. The sky-high approval rate is even more remarkable given the organizational weakness of organized labor. Unions currently represent just 10.3 percent of the American workforce.\n\n\n\nSecond, there's a mini-organizing wave — driven by worker-organizers, not full-time union officials — taking place across the low-wage service sector. Most notably, workers at 235 Starbucks stores have voted to unionize since Starbucks Workers United historic first victories in Buffalo, N.Y., last December; the independent Amazon Labor Union (ALU) won at a Staten Island warehouse with 8000 workers in April; Apple retail store workers in Towson, Md., formed the company’s first union in June, as did Trader Joe’s workers in Massachusetts and Minneapolis, REI workers in New York City and Berkeley, and  Chipotle workers in Lansing, Mich. There hasn’t been this much excitement around labor activism in low-wage, non-union sectors of the economy for decades.\n\n\n\nThird, the number of workers — often young, progressive, college-educated working-class — talking union continues to grow by the week: cultural (museum and gallery) workers, non-profit workers, digital media workers, video game designers and even Facebook workers.\n\n\n\nBut the news isn’t all positive. There’s a huge disconnect between the energy and enthusiasm for union among young workers versus national union membership trends. Because of weak laws and strong employer opposition, national union membership rates have been falling for decades. Private sector union density was just 6.1 percent in 2021.\n\n\n\nMoreover, when you think about what it would take to bring about union revival, and consider all&nbsp;the factors that have contributed to union decline&nbsp;— globalization, automation, new employment forms such as gig work, deregulation, non-union domestic competition, changes in the structure of corporate governance and so on — meaningful revival seems virtually impossible.&nbsp;But the current moment offers some hope.\n\n\n\nGrassroots Campaigns Key to Sparking Organizing and winning Labor Law Reform&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI have long believed that the current wave of \"self-organization\" is the only possible way that meaningful union revival could happen in the United&nbsp;States.&nbsp;The Starbucks and Amazon union campaigns have excited young workers and made them believe that organizing is possible, even in the face of ferocious union busting by the wealthiest corporations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMoreover, this kind of grassroots organizing is the only way we're likely to gain stronger labor laws.&nbsp;Survey evidence shows that almost half of non-union workers would like to have union representation but strong employer opposition and weak legal protection for the right to choose a union means they are unlikely to get it. But we'll never get labor law reform unless the public understands the issues, cares about them, and feels it has a stake in the outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConsider&nbsp;the campaign for the Employee Free Choice Act, the failed effort to strengthen the right to choose a union during the early days of the Obama administration.&nbsp;I left my academic job at the London School of Economics and took a position as research director at the University of California Berkeley Labor Center at that time in large part because&nbsp;I believed it possible that unions could win labor law reform.&nbsp;But, on reflection, EFCA likely never stood a chance:&nbsp;it was a quiescent period in union organizing, no one was paying attention to the issue — one could never meet anyone who had even heard of EFCA unless they had a professional interest — and President Obama didn't lift a finger to help it; but his lack of meaningful action was inevitable given the first two issues.\n\n\n\nToday, in contrast, we have dynamic organizing campaigns at Starbucks, Amazon and several others; many more people are paying attention to union issues than has been true for decades — in large part because of the&nbsp;incredible traditional and social media coverage generated by those campaigns&nbsp;— and we have a White House whose occupant wants to be remembered as&nbsp;the “most pro-union President in history.”&nbsp;Those factors won’t be enough to win labor law reform, but without them, unions don't stand a chance: their allies will never be able to force labor reform through the Senate while no one is looking, so to speak, because&nbsp;the corporate lobby will always be stronger than the union lobby&nbsp;and will always have sufficient votes to block it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSomething’s Happening Here….&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe don't know what the legacy of the current union moment will be; it could yet all go up in a puff of smoke, but that doesn't mean that there's not something historic happening. As a result of the inspirational campaigns at Starbucks and Amazon, unions have overcome the parochialism that has always defined them, even in their heyday, and entered the media mainstream. Union issues have become a matter of general interest.&nbsp;Throughout the country young workers are excited about labor activism&nbsp;— and much of this grassroots activism among younger workers is&nbsp;happening despite the national labor movement, not because of it. The organizing dynamism is coming from below, not above. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nStarbucks Union is the Best Model Yet for Union Revival&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStarbucks Workers United provides the best model for how the established labor movement can interact with the young, insurgents who want to organize in the low-wage service sector and beyond; it has also developed a replicable model that has resulted in 235&nbsp;unionized stores at a ferociously anti-union superstar corporation — a unique achievement in the history of U.S unions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe best hope for any meaningful union revival in the United States is that next Labor Day we have dozens more Starbucks Workers United style of organizing campaigns.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJohn Logan is professor and director of Labor and Employment Studies at San Francisco State University.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Canadian battle rapper Pat Stay was fatally stabbed just past midnight on Sunday in the province of Nova Scotia, the Halifax Police Department said in a news release.\n\n\n\nPolice said Stay, 36, was stabbed around 12:35 a.m. in downtown Halifax. He was transported to the hospital, where he later died.\n\n\n\nThe Nova Scotia Medical Examiner Service ruled his death a homicide. Police are continuing to investigate the incident.\n\n\n\nStay, from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, was known for his skill in rap battles, in which rappers use rhyme and wordplay to competitively diss and outperform the other. Stay was hailed for his freestyle rap form.\n\n\n\nThe music world mourned his death following the news. Rapper and musician Eminem tweeted Sunday night that \"hiphop lost one of the best battlers of all time … RIP @patstay .. KINGS NEVER DIE!!\"\n\n\n\nStay had recently defended Eminem from rival hip-hop artist The Game, who released a diss song \"The Black Slim Shady\" attacking him. Stay dropped a song on his prolific YouTube channel that dissed The Game in return.\n\n\n\nOther rappers expressed their condolences for the Canadian battle rapper. Drake made a post about the freestyle rapper on Instagram, and both Immortal Technique and Royce Da 5'9\" paid their respects on Twitter.\n\n\n\nA fundraiser for Stay has reached more than $100,000 on GoFundMe, hitting the target goal for the musician's loved ones.\n\n\n\nThe news came on the same day as a series of stabbings in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, although the provinces are on opposite sides of the country.",

        "description": "The Orioles announced they&#8217;ve claimed reliever Jake Reed off waivers from the Dodgers. In a corresponding move, Baltimore placed infielder Jonathan Araúz on the restricted list. The O&#8217;s also announced that righty Phoenix Sanders, whom they&#8217;d designated for assignment over the weekend, has gone unclaimed on waivers and been sent outright to Triple-A Norfolk.\nReed has been a frequent name on the waiver wire over the past two seasons. A minor league signee of the Dodgers, the right-hander first reached the big leagues in July 2021. He&#8217;s subsequently gone from L.A. to the Rays, the Mets and then back to the Dodgers on waivers. His second stint with the Dodgers lasted less than two months, as he was claimed in mid-July but designated for assignment last Friday when the club reinstated Blake Treinen from the injured list. The O&#8217;s become the latest team to take a shot on Reed, who&#8217;d also spent time in the Twins and Angels organizations before getting to the majors.\nDespite drawing frequent interest from clubs, the University of Oregon product doesn&#8217;t have a ton of big league experience. He&#8217;s logged 21 innings over 20 appearances, posting a 5.57 ERA with a below-average 19.7% strikeout percentage. The low-slot righty has a better track record in the upper minors, pitching to a 3.84 ERA with a 25.6% strikeout rate through parts of six seasons in Triple-A. The O&#8217;s can bounce him between Baltimore and Norfolk for both this season and next if he holds a spot on their 40-man roster, as he&#8217;s in his second of three minor league option years.\nWhile Reed can factor into the Orioles surprising postseason push this month, he wouldn&#8217;t be available to the club in the playoffs if they can run down a Wild Card spot. Players acquired after August 31 are ineligible for a team&#8217;s playoff roster. Now that he&#8217;s changed organizations in September, Reed won&#8217;t be allowed to participate in the 2022 postseason.\nAraúz was claimed off waivers from the Red Sox in June. He&#8217;s spent most of his Orioles tenure on optional assignment to Norfolk but hasn&#8217;t appeared in a game since last Friday. The club hasn&#8217;t provided a reason for his absence, but Araúz will not count against the 40-man roster (nor will he be paid) for any time he spends on the restricted list.\nSanders was also a waiver claim from an AL East rival, joining the O&#8217;s from the Rays a few weeks ago. The 27-year-old didn&#8217;t suit up at the big league level with Baltimore, but he&#8217;ll stick in the organization. Sanders has never been outrighted before in his career, and he doesn&#8217;t have the requisite three years of MLB service time to elect free agency. Sanders made his first eight MLB appearances with the Rays earlier in the season, allowing five runs with a 12:3 strikeout-to-walk ratio through 14 2/3 innings.",

        "description": "Venice film festival: A wealthy young woman, friendless and lost after studying abroad, sets about recovering an old friendship she thinks she once hadActor-turned-director Carolina Cavalli makes her feature debut with this elegant, angular contrivance: an absurdist existential comedy about an entitled twentysomething called Amanda (Benedetta Porcaroli, from Netflix’s Baby) who has reached a quarterlife crisis.Amanda has finished an unsatisfying period in Paris studying and returned to her wealthy family home in Italy, the scene of a near-drowning childhood accident in the swimming pool and the base for her extended dysfunctional clan. Like someone awakening from a dream, Amanda realises she has no boyfriend, no job and no friends. So when her mother (Monica Nappo) tells her that she once played as a little kid with a local girl called Rebecca, the daughter of her mother’s friend (Giovanna Mezzogiorno), Amanda sets out with fanatical determination to re-befriend this now adult woman (Galatéa Belluggi), or to create the illusion that they were once friends. Rebecca turns out to be an agoraphobic shut-in, quite as messed up as Amanda, but this only increases her eligibility for being Amanda’s new best mate.The film, like its heroine, is on its own spectrum of emotional bewilderment, full of looming closeups and wayward, asymmetric compositions, with something of Lanthimos or Kaurismaki, or the Italian director Paolo Sorrentino whose influence is obvious and who is in fact credited for his special contribution. It is a film that riffs entertainingly on details that are part of what is essentially a comically first-world-problem universe: Amanda is obsessed with getting enough supermarket loyalty points to get an electric fan which she can sell online. She even gets a temp job at an electrical goods store and instantly behaves with insouciant high-handedness towards her baffled boss. But does she really need the money? She meets a guy at a techno club (with weirdly few customers) and decides that he is to be her boyfriend, and moreover conceives an obsession with owning a horse that she has seen in a nearby field.

        "description": "Larry Robinson-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The boys are back on Blake in game one against the Milwaukee Brewers The Colorado Rockies are back on Blake today and will face the Milwaukee Brewers for game one of three. \nToday the Rockies will call on Ryan Feltner (2-6, 5.78 ERA). In his last two outings he gave up a total of six earned runs, three per game. In his last game in Atlanta, he struck out seven total batters. Hopefully today we see more strikeouts and less runs. \nOpposite Feltner, Adrian Houser (4-9, 5.02 ERA) will pitch for Milwaukee. Houser was just activated on August 24th after spending nearly two months on the IL. Houser has pitched a grand total of 4 1⁄3 innings since his return, giving up a total of five earned runs, with all of those coming on his first appearance on August 24. \nThis series will also be the Coors Field debut of Michael Toglia, though he’s not unfamiliar with Coors Field after playing here in the 2021 Futures Game. \n\n\nMichael Toglia on his successful first week in the majors ahead of his first home game: pic.twitter.com/KVdyaGoLp9— Danielle Allentuck (@d_allentuck) September 5, 2022\n\n\n\nFirst Pitch: 2:10 PM MDT\nTV: AT&amp;T Sports Net Rocky Mountain; MLB.tv\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM; KNRV 1150 (Spanish)\nLineups:\n\n\nNew series, new lineup : @BallySportWI : @620wtmj#ThisIsMyCrew pic.twitter.com/7RIy4GTdV4— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 5, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n#Rockies lineup vs. #Brewers pic.twitter.com/ib7bVud86F— Thomas Harding (@harding_at_mlb) September 5, 2022",

And it worked! More than 8.1 million people went to the movies on Saturday, Variety found, compared to 1 million the day before and 1.7 million the day after. National Cinema Day brought the biggest crowds to theaters of any day in 2022, which leads to one inevitable conclusion: people will go to movies when movies only cost three bucks.

        "description": "President Biden responded to a heckler while delivering remarks in Milwaukee on Monday, saying, “Everybody’s entitled to be an idiot.”\n\n\n\nBiden traveled to Wisconsin on Labor Day to deliver a speech at Milwaukee Laborfest, where he spoke about his support for unions and lauded Democratic legislative victories such as last year's coronavirus relief package and a bill to invest in domestic semiconductor manufacturing that he signed into law last month. \n\n\n\nAt one point, someone in the audience could be heard trying to disrupt the speech.\n\n\n\n“No, no, no, don't — let him go. He's, look, everybody's entitled to be an idiot,” Biden said. It was not immediately clear what prompted the heckling or what the person was saying.\n\n\n\nBiden also responded to protesters while delivering a prime-time speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia on Thursday. Hecklers shouted “F Joe Biden” and the anti-Biden phrase “Let’s go, Brandon.”\n\n\n\n“They’re entitled to be outrageous. This is a democracy,” Biden said during that speech, also saying, “Good manners is nothing they’ve ever suffered from.”\n\n\n\nBiden’s stop in Wisconsin comes two months ahead of the November midterms. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) and Democratic Senate nominee Mandela Barnes are gearing up for high-profile contests against Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), respectively. ",

        "description": "Russia on Monday banned 25 more Americans from entering the country, including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, multiple U.S. senators, and actors Ben Stiller and Sean Penn.\n\n\n\nThe additions, which bring the total number of Americans banned from entering Russia to 1,073, are in response to U.S. sanctions on Russians following the country’s invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Raimondo, Russia's newest sanctions target multiple senior Commerce Department officials, including Deputy Secretary Don Graves and two assistant secretaries.\n\n\n\nThe list also includes six senators: Sens. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). Russia had previously sanctioned more than a dozen other sitting senators.\n\n\n\nRussia also on Monday banned from entering the country actors Sean Penn and Ben Stiller, both of whom visited Ukraine during the war.\n\n\n\nPenn was in Ukraine in February to film a documentary as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces moved in, and he met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the eve of the invasion.\n\n\n\n“I do know that we have to invest everything that we have to support the Ukrainian people and to support President Zelensky, or I do not think we will have a legitimate memory of what America hopes to be,” the “Milk” star told CNN’s Anderson Cooper during a March interview.\n\n\n\nStiller met with Zelensky in late June in connection with his role as global goodwill ambassador to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\n\n\n“It’s one thing to see this destruction on TV or on social networks. Another thing is to see it all with your own eyes,” Stiller said during the visit. “That’s a lot more shocking.”\n\n\n\nRussia's latest round of sanctions also included multiple private sector executives at firms such as geospatial analytics company HawkEye 360 and fertilizer manufacturer CF Industries.\n\n\n\nThe sanctions also include people working at nongovernmental organization and nonprofits, including former Rep. Tom Perriello (D-Va.), the executive director of Open Societies, a grant-making organization chaired by Democratic mega-donor George Soros. \n\n\n\n“The hostile actions of the American authorities, which continue to follow a Russophobic course, destroying bilateral ties and escalating confrontation between Russia and the United States, will continue to be resolutely rebuffed,” Russia's statement announcing the sanctions read.The Biden administration has imposed multiple rounds of financial sanctions and visa restrictions on wealthy Russians, Kremlin-linked individuals and Russian financial institutions to increase pressure on the Kremlin amid its war in Ukraine.",

        "description": "In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Ben Stiller talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during their meeting in Kyiv, Ukraine, June 20, 2022.Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/APRussia imposed personal sanctions Monday on 25 Americans, including actors Sean Penn and Ben Stiller, in response to U.S. sanctions against Russians stemming from the conflict in Ukraine.U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was on the new sanctions list, as were several American senators: Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Rick Scott of Florida, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.Russia&#x27;s Foreign Ministry said the group, which also included business leaders, academics and government officials, would be banned permanently from entering Russia.Previous rounds of Russian sanctions against Americans have included President Joe Biden and members of his family, as well as lawmakers and business leaders. The U.S. has sanctioned numerous Russians, including government officials and business people.Penn and Stiller have been outspoken critics of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. Penn is an activist involved in relief work, among other causes. Stiller is a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Copyright 2022 NPR.

This new model has an amazing five-octave pitch range, increased bass response, and easier playability.\n\n\n\nWith no reeds to blow, no keys to press, and no strings to pluck, the theremin defies all expectations of a musical instrument. It is instead played in a manner that seemingly conjures music from the ether, simply through the motion of the body when close to the instrument.\n\n\n\nThe sound of the instrument is powerfully ethereal, as demonstrated in The Octopus Project song &#8220;I Saw the Bright Shinies&#8221;.\n\n\n\nTo debut the new Etherwave Theremin, Austin-based electronica group The Octopus Project performs their original track “I Saw the Bright Shinies” in a performance filmed in the Moog Sound Lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Moog Music (@moogsynthesizers) \n\n\n\nOther artists have debuted this new version as well.\n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Moog Music (@moogsynthesizers) \n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Moog Music (@moogsynthesizers) \n\n\n\nvia Boing Boing",

        "description": "Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  If it weren’t for the Astros depth in the starting rotation, their top pitching prospect Hunter Brown surely would’ve made his major league debut long before this evening against the Rangers. In fact, he’d probably been promoted months ago if he was rostered by one of the 29 other clubs. Thanks to the active roster expanding in September, he finally has a chance to showcase his talents on the biggest stage of his profession. \nWith one of the more dynamic arms in the minors, Brown’s numbers this season — 2.55 ERA and a 31.5 percent strikeout rate in 106 innings — have further justified his top prospect billing. His swing-and-miss potential appeals to many, especially in shorter appearances. Developed as a starter, the lack of an immediate opening likely forces Brown into a relief role if he is included on the postseason roster. As such, Houston is presenting an opportunity to the 24-year-old right-hander this month to ascertain whether he can provide some value to the club for October. As I mentioned last week here, it is worth experimenting with players like Brown and Yanier Diaz in September to see if that is a feasible plan. \nSo, what should we expect to see from Brown in his debut later today? \nThe right-hander primarily utilizes four pitches: A four-seam fastball, curveball, slider, and changeup. Of those four pitches, the best two offerings are arguably his fastball, which can occasionally reach the upper nineties, and his high-spin curveball that misses plenty of bats. He also mixes in his slider and occasionally his changeup. \nThe first clip below is Brown’s four-seam fastball in action, reaching about 95 miles per hour. Does it remind you of another four-seam fastball thrown higher in the zone for whiffs? \n  \n        \n  \nAn effective pitch across multiple areas of the strike zone, as with other pitchers who have been developed within the Astros’ minor league system, Brown’s four-seam misses plenty of bats higher in the zone. Arguably the best pitch in his repertoire, especially if his command continues to show improvement. \nBut the pitch that I am looking forward to watching later this evening is Brown’s curveball, which was implemented by the Astros following their selection of the right-hander in the fifth round of the 2019 draft. The gif below is a bit grainy, but his curveball is a breaking pitch that generates plenty of spin, which ought to help it miss a fair share of bats at the major league level. \n  \n        \n  \nTruthfully, I am a sucker for curveballs with loads of breaking action. Brown’s curveball is the pitch that I am most optimistic about. That said, I am also interested to see how and when Brown utilizes his slider and changeup. His slider, in particular, is effective but not quite on the same level as his curveball. Still, an effective pitch when used in the right spots, and it offers a different look depending on the matchup and sequencing. \nHowever, the main issue in Brown’s minor league career isn’t a lack of pitches to use; rather, it is more about lapses in command and his propensity to walk opposing hitters. But this problem appears to have been mitigated to some extent since June 18, the last outing he had when he allowed more than three walks in a game. \n\n4/6 to 6/18: 29 walks\n6/24 to 8/28: 16 walks\n\nCommand, or lack thereof, will likely determine whether Brown’s 2022 season continues into October or not. It is something to watch in this start and any future appearances he makes between now and his regular season finale. If it isn’t much of an issue, I will venture to say he may actually earn a spot on the postseason roster.",

        "description": "Photo by Thomas A. Ferrara/Newsday RM via Getty Images\n    \n\n  A quick review of how the Mets’ pitchers fared over the past week. Given the fact that the Mets lost back-to-back 7-1 games against the Juan Soto and Josh Bell-less Washington Nationals, you’d think this meter would look a lot worse. But really the bad pitching performances were confined to just a couple of players, one of whom is no longer on the roster. And meanwhile, the pitching staff fared very well against a formidable Dodgers lineup. This week saw Trevor May hit the injured list for an undisclosed (likely COVID-related) reason, but Tommy Hunter and Carlos Carrasco both made their returns from the injured list, although the latter less successfully than the former. Max Scherzer had to leave his start early due to left side fatigue and the game got away from the Mets after his departure, but the Mets are confident he will miss only one start. With Tylor Megill progressing in his rehab and Drew Smith also set to return in the somewhat near future, the Mets’ pitching staff is getting progressively healthier, but questions remain regarding Carlos Carrasco’s health and the relative dearth of reliable late-inning options. However, this week, Mychal Givens finally had a strong week and Seth Lugo continues to shine.\n  \n        \n  \nLet’s start with Carlos Carrasco’s performance yesterday, which left a lot to be desired. He gave up a run right away in the first inning, but was able to limit the damage with a timely double play. He then seemed to settle in, tossing a relatively quick scoreless second inning. But then things unraveled on him in the third. It’s true that Jeff McNeil botched what could have been an inning-ending double play and maybe we would not be having this conversation. But, Carrasco simply could not put the inning to bed after that and ended up surrendering four runs before being lifted from the game, unable to finish the third inning. He avoids the poop emoji because none of those third inning runs were earned, so in the end he was only charged with one run over 2 2⁄3 innings, striking out two batters and walking two batters. But it was still abundantly clear that Carrasco was not quite himself and maybe could have used a rehab start or two before returning to big league action. \nTrevor Williams picked up the bulk of the innings in long relief yesterday after Carrasco’s early exit after not pitching for two weeks. Although Williams was not as impeccably good as he had been recently, he did what the Mets needed him to do by eating the innings. He picked up Carrasco by recording the final out in the third without allowing any of his inherited runners to score and then he pitched four additional innings after that, allowing two runs on five hits, striking out three batters, and walking two. \nTommy Hunter, back from the injured list, pitched the final two innings of yesterday’s game in mop-up duty. He allowed just one baserunner over those two frames via a walk and struck out one batter. Hunter gets a perfect clean sheet in his first week back; he finished the seventh inning of Tuesday’s loss after the Dodgers took the lead against Joely Rodríguez and he worked around two hits to pitch a scoreless sixth inning after Max Scherzer’s early exit on Saturday.\nMax Scherzer had been pitching well on Saturday before he took the cautious (and likely appropriate) route of not pushing himself through the fatigue he was feeling in his left side. The only damage off Scherzer through five innings of work was a first-inning solo homer off the bat of Luis García. Scherzer yielded three total hits in the five frames, struck out five batters, and walked one. Hopefully the fatigue is not a lasting issue for him and he will be able to go deeper into the game in his next start.\nIt was Adam Ottavino who took the loss on Saturday—his third loss of the season—for giving up the go-ahead homer to Lane Thomas in the eighth inning that snapped a 1-1 tie. But Ottavino does not get bad marks for this week; his other two outings were excellent. Ottavino pitched on back-to-back days in high leverage in the Dodgers series and was successful both times. On Wednesday, he earned his 18th hold of the season for pitching a scoreless eighth inning in relief of Jacob deGrom to set things up for Edwin Díaz. He struck out two batters in the outing. He then turned around the following day and earned his third save of the season, protecting a two-run lead and also striking out two batters in that outing. \nAlthough it was Ottavino who took the loss on Saturday, it was Adonis Medina who let the game get away. He started the ninth inning with the Mets down a run and his job was to keep the Nationals off the board to at least give the Mets a chance to come back in the bottom of the frame. He failed to even get out of the inning. He recorded just one out and gave up five runs, four of which were earned. When Carrasco was activated from the injured list yesterday, Medina was sent back down to the minors. \nWhen Trevor May was placed on the injured list on Saturday without an injury designation, righty Bryce Montes de Oca was called up to take his place on the roster. May pitched a scoreless seventh inning in Thursday’s victory and earned his fifth hold of the season; this represents his only work for the week before hitting the IL. Montes de Oca came in the game to clean up Medina’s mess on Saturday and gave up a hit and a walk but didn’t allow any additional runs to score. He also struck out a batter in his first Mets outing. As of right now, Montes de Oca remains on the roster, but may be sent back down when the next rehabbing pitcher returns. \nNow that we have the weekend’s unpleasantness out of the way, most of the rest of this meter is positive. Jacob deGrom gave the Mets the ace performance they needed against the Dodgers, surrendering just one run on a solo homer by Mookie Betts through seven innings of work on Wednesday. He struck out nine batters and walked one. Of course, he may have left with the game tied if not for Brandon Nimmo’s spectacular play robbing Justin Turner of a game-tying homer. Nonetheless, deGrom was still excellent, earning his fourth win of the season. \nAfter Ottavino’s scoreless eighth, Edwin Díaz entered the game with Timmy Trumpet playing his signature entrance music live in an absolutely electric environment. And Díaz delivered an electric performance to go along with it, tossing a 1-2-3 ninth inning to notch his 29th save of the season. The only reason Díaz does not get a fireball this week is because he allowed a run in his other outing the following day, but it did not cost the Mets the game. Buck Showalter opted to use Díaz in the eighth inning on Thursday to protect a three-run lead against the heart of the Dodgers order. He did so, but he looked human in the process. He started the inning by walking Freddie Freeman and then hitting Will Smith with a pitch to bring the tying run to the plate. He then gave up two straight well-hit, deep fly balls, but luckily both stayed in the ballpark. The first advanced the runners and the second plated a run via a sacrifice fly to bring the Dodgers within two. But Díaz shut things down after that, ending the inning with an exclamation point by striking out Gavin Lux on a 102.8mph fastball. This performance earned Díaz his fourth hold of the season. \nThe strong relief work from May, Díaz, and Ottavino in Thursday’s rubber game victory came in relief of Chris Bassitt, who was very good in his start this week. Bassitt held a formidable Dodgers lineup to two runs on six hits over six innings of work. He struck out four batters and walked three batters. This strong performance earned Bassitt his 12th win of the season. His season ERA stands at 3.32. \nTaijuan Walker pitched the first game of the Dodgers series and delivered a fine performance, giving up three runs on five hits through 5 1⁄3 innings of work. He struck out five batters and walked three in the outing. All three Dodgers runs came in the third inning where Walker hit Joey Gallo with the bases loaded to plate the game-tying run and then gave up a go-ahead single to Gavin Lux. But he managed to settle down and stop the bleeding and Mark Canha’s game-tying homer ensured Walker did not take the loss.\nIt was Joely Rodríguez who ultimately took the loss on Tuesday, as he came in a tie game in the seventh inning and gave up a leadoff double to Freddie Freeman and then a one-out single to Gavin Lux. It was Rodríguez’s fourth loss of the season. However, his other two outings this week were good ones. He pitched a scoreless eighth inning in Friday’s victory complete with two strikeouts and pitched a scoreless seventh inning on Saturday before that game went south for the Mets. \nBut, it was a great week for Mychal Givens, who desperately needed a good week to hang his hat on. With the Mets down by a run after Rodríguez’s outing on Tuesday, Givens pitched two scoreless innings to give the Mets a chance to come back, allowing only one baserunner via a walk. He followed up that performance by earning the win on Friday, pitching 1 2⁄3 scoreless innings in relief of David Peterson.\nDavid Peterson started Friday’s game and exited the game with the Mets losing, but ultimately the Mets came back to win. Peterson gave the usual David Peterson performance: ultimately fine, but sort of frustrating to watch. He allowed eight hits so was constantly negotiating traffic on the base paths, but he limited the Nationals to three runs over 5 1⁄3 innings of work. But in his usual Peterson fashion, he needed 95 pitches to do so. He did strike out six batters in the outing while walking only one. \nAfter Givens negotiated the rest of the sixth inning for Peterson plus contributing a scoreless seventh, Rodríguez pitched the eighth, and Seth Lugo finished things off on Friday with a scoreless ninth inning, complete with two strikeouts. It was another strong week for Lugo, who performed a Houdini escape act on Tuesday to get out of the sixth inning without further damage to keep the Mets in striking distance. With Taijuan Walker having given up a one-out double, Lugo came in the game to record the final two outs of the inning. He did so, but he loaded the bases by walking two batters. But he was still able to come out unscathed to post a 0.00 ERA for the week. It’s Lugo’s second strong week in a row and his season ERA is now down in the low threes.",

        "description": "Photo by David Berding/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Wacha and roll I don’t know what the Red Sox expected out of Michael Wacha but it probably wasn’t a 2.56 ERA/3.80 FIP in 95 innings. The Sox are 13-4 in games he started. When you consider a shutout and a seven-inning start are his only games going deeper than six innings and the troublesome bullpen in 2022 is pretty good! Chaim Bloom picking up a reclamation project abandoned by the Rays after 2021 turned out OK. Granted, the strikeouts are down and the walks are up and his FIP shows he’s been a little worse than he’s appeared. But in this season of mostly disaster, he’s been a very bright spot. Even five clean innings at a time is a welcome sign this year when good starts have been hard to come by. Of more trivia than forecasting, Wacha’s two starts against the year have been solid enough efforts: two runs over five innings in April and four runs over six innings on August 26.\nTriston Casas collected his first hit yesterday in his major league debut and is heading home to Florida where he certainly will have a loud cheering section is the usually vacant Tropicana Field. \nAfter entering September with a five-game hitless streak, Rafael Devers started to turn it back on against the Texas Rangers. He had two hits in each of the first three games before an 0-4 yesterday. The third baseman still hasn’t found his power stroke since returning from the IL with just three home runs since the beginning of August and none since August 14. He enters today a .261/.324/.412 hitter at the Trop with 5 home runs in 41 games.",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Reed was designated for assignment by LA on Friday Jake Reed goes from one contending team to another. The right-hander was claimed off waivers by the Orioles on Monday, three days after he was designated for assignment by the Dodgers.\nReed pitched for the Dodgers in both 2021 and 2022, with similar paths both years. He was acquired around the middle of the year, pitched in the majors, at some point pitched for the Mets, and was eventually claimed off waivers by another team.\nThis year, the 29-year-old Reed was claimed by the Dodgers off waivers from the Mets on July 13, and within two weeks was in the majors. When sent to Triple-A Oklahoma City on July 31, that was his fifth time getting optioned this season, the maximum allowed by the collective bargaining agreement.\nReed was called up again last Tuesday in New York, along with Heath Hembree to fortify a taxed bullpen. Pressed into duty immediately, Hembree earned the win in last week’s series opener over the Mets, with Reed earning the save, the first of his career. He’s one of nine Dodgers pitchers to record a save in 2022.\nIn all, Reed had a 1.93 ERA in 4⅔ innings with the Dodgers, with two strikeouts and a walk. He pitched in five of the seven games for which he was active. But when Blake Treinen was activated off the 60-day injured list on Friday after missing over four months with a partial tear of his shoulder capsule, the Dodgers needed to make room on both the active and 40-man rosters. They designated the effectively out-of-options Reed for assignment, which led us to Monday’s waiver claim. \nReed joins an Orioles team that entered Monday 2½ games behind Toronto for the final American League wild card spot. Since he wasn’t in the organization by August 31, Reed would be ineligible should Baltimore reach the postseason, but he can at least help them try to get there.\nSome Dodgers designated for assignment this season have cleared waivers and stuck around in Triple-A, including Carson Fulmer, Robbie Erlin, and Stefen Romero. But they’ve also lost a handful on waivers.\nDarien Núñez, out for the year with Tommy John surgery, was claimed by the Giants on April 27. The left-hander was soon released but quickly re-signed by San Francisco to a minor league contract.\nIan Gibaut was claimed off waivers by the Dodgers on June 30, and was even active for two games for Los Angeles but did not pitch. He was claimed off waivers by the Reds on July 5, and has a 4.44 ERA and 3.03 FIP in 22 relief appearances for Cincinnati.\nRylan Bannon had a similarly short time with the Dodgers, claimed from the Orioles in August but designated for assignment four days later without having played for Los Angeles. Bannon was claimed off waivers by the Braves on August 16, and is hitting .350/.482/.575 in 13 games with Triple-A Gwinnett.\nReyes Moronta signed a minor league deal with the Dodgers in March and pitched 22 games in relief. He was designated for assignment when Dustin May was activated, then Moronta was claimed off waivers by the D-backs on August 22. Moronta has allowed two runs in 4⅓ innings in five games for Arizona.",

        "description": "President Biden expressed his support for labor unions and boasted about Democratic legislative victories during a Wisconsin labor event just two months ahead of the November midterms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSpeaking at Milwaukee Laborfest, the president said Labor Day is “a special day to me as well because the fact of the matter here is I wouldn't be here without unions! Unions. Electricians, iron workers ... teamsters, laborers, bricklayers, transit workers, plumbers and pipefitters, steel workers.”\n\n\n\nHe also said union support helped propel him to the Senate years ago, saying that “union labor endorsed me and fought for me.”\n\n\n\nBiden also continued his attacks against \"MAGA Republicans,\" referring to former President Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan.\n\n\n\nBorrowing language from his Thursday speech in Philadelphia, Biden said, “Not every Republican is a MAGA Republican. Not every Republican embraces that extreme ideology. I know because I've been able to work with mainstream Republicans my whole career. But the extreme MAGA Republicans in Congress have chosen to go backwards, full of anger, violence, hate and division.”\n\n\n\nBiden on Thursday delivered remarks from Independence Hall in which he portrayed Republicans aligned with Trump as a threat to democracy and many rights.\n\n\n\nThose who attended the Monday labor event included Gov. Tony Evers (D), Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), and President of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations Liz Shuler. \n\n\n\nBiden also used the event in a swing state with a crucial Senate race to tout a number of his administration's legislative victories, including a coronavirus relief package, the bill he signed last month to fuel investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and scientific research, and aspects of the sweeping health, tax and climate reconciliation package.\n\n\n\nWisconsin will hold two closely watched contests in November for governor and Senate. Democrats are hopeful they can unseat Sen. Ron Johnson (Wis.), who is considered one of the most vulnerable Senate Republicans fighting for another term. \n\n\n\nA Fox News poll released last month found 49 percent of Wisconsin voters backing Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes (D), while 45 percent supported Johnson. The polling falls within the margin of error, effectively tying the two. \n\n\n\n“For decades, Big Pharma tried to block giving lower drug prices for those on Medicare or anywhere else. For decades, Big Pharma won year in year out because they own chunks of the Congress, because they had the help, like your senior senator, Ron Johnson, who said,” Biden said to boos after saying Johnson’s name.\n\n\n\n“I want to say what he said,” Biden continued. “He said he opposed lowering drug costs because we result in punishing the pharmaceutical industry. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I mean, come on, man.”\n\n\n\nBiden was referring to an interview Johnson did with Fox News host Brian Kilmeade in August. Kilmeade asked Johnson about his thoughts on Medicare being allowed to bid on pharmaceutical prices, with the senator alleging the pharmaceutical industry and innovation would be negatively affected. The Democratic reconciliation package will allow some drug prices to be negotiated by Medicare. \n\n\n\n“When you start punishing the pharmaceutical industry, you're going to have less innovation, you're going to have fewer lifesaving drugs. That's not a good thing,” Johnson commented at one point. ",

        "description": "Left-hander Lucas Gilbreath, who flashed promise as a late-game reliever for the Rockies, is out for the remainder of the season.\nHe&#8217;s planning to get a PRP (platelet-rich plasma) injection this week in the hopes that he can avoid Tommy John surgery. He&#8217;s been on the injured list with a left elbow flexor strain since Aug. 28.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m hoping that everything goes well and I&#8217;m hoping to be ready for next season,&#8221; Gilbreath said after the Rockies&#8217; 6-4 loss to the Brewers on Monday. &#8220;It&#8217;s frustrating to end the season this way, especially the way I was throwing lately.\n&#8220;But I think we caught it at a good time and hopefully we can give it ample opportunity (to heal).&#8221;\nGilbreath, 26, a graduate of Broomfield&#8217;s Legacy High School, pitched very well for much of the season and posted a 4.19 ERA in 47 appearances. However, in his last seven outings, before he went on the IL, he was erratic, submitting a 6.75 ERA with a 1.69 WHIP.\nHe didn&#8217;t want to blame his poor performance on his ailing elbow but did say it was a factor.\n&#8220;It didn&#8217;t feel great and there was a point when I was trying to work through it and make it happen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The training staff did a great job trying to make me feel like I could compete.\n&#8220;So that wasn&#8217;t necessarily the reason for my struggles, but toward the end, it definitely got to the point where it was annoying and it started to bother me when I was out there. That&#8217;s the time that we decided to take some action on it.&#8221;\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tKeeler: Todd Helton&#8217;s second coming?

Veteran shortstop Jose Iglesias was not available for Monday&#8217;s game after injuring his left hand during the fourth inning of the first game of Sunday&#8217;s doubleheader at Cincinnati. Iglesias will undergo an MRI on Tuesday and the Rockies will then make a decision about a possible stint on the IL.\nBlack said that Iglesias has swelling and soreness in the palm and thumb areas of his left hand. Iglesias, 32, has been Colorado&#8217;s steadiest offensive player this season, putting together a slash line of .300/.337/.392 in 423 at-bats. He&#8217;s scheduled to become a free agent at the end of the season.\nDaza&#8217;s return. Outfielder Yonathan Daza, out since Aug. 12 with a dislocated left shoulder, is close to returning from his rehab assignment with Triple-A Albuquerque. He was en route to Denver on Monday but was not available for the afternoon&#8217;s game. Daza will likely be activated before Tuesday night’s game against the Brewers, meaning the Rockies will have to make a roster move to place Daza on the active roster.\nShould Iglesias need time on the IL, Daza could replace Iglesias on the active roster. However, if Iglesias doesn&#8217;t have to go on the IL, the Rockies would likely have to make a roster move involving another outfielder.",

        "link": "https://www.denverpost.com/2022/09/02/sitting-down-college-football-leadership-actually-approved-an-expanded-playoff-but-not-without-some-murkiness/",
        "description": "When the commissioners couldn’t deliver, the presidents stepped in and got it done: The College Football Playoff will  finally, officially, expand to 12 teams in the 2026 season &#8212; and possibly earlier.\nThe university presidents and chancellors who make up the CFP’s Board of Managers approved expansion Friday, approximately eight months after the conference commissioners failed to agree on the format. (ESPN was the first to report the news.)\nHowever, the presidents left many details, including the start date, to those very same commissioners.\nNext week, the leaders of the 10 Football Bowl Subdivision conferences and Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick will convene to (presumably) hammer out the specifics.\nOne critical piece &#8212; access — has a working framework in place: The six highest-ranked conference champions and six at-large teams will make up the 12-team field.\nIn other words, the Pac-12 would have a clear pathway to the event as long as its champion is one of the top six. (There are only 10 conferences.)\nPut another way: The Pac-12 winner could be ranked behind the champions of the ACC, Big 12, Big Ten and SEC and a winner from one of the Group of Five leagues and still make the field.\nThat’s a significant development for the conference, which is fighting for relevance and survival after the announced departures of USC and UCLA, to the Big Ten, in 2024.\nAs they attempt to stay unified, the 10 remaining members have placed a heavy emphasis on media rights revenue and playoff access.\nThe former is being negotiated this fall with ESPN, Fox and other potential partners.\nThe CFP framework approved Friday by the presidents should allay concerns about the latter.\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tKeeler: Todd Helton&#8217;s second coming?

CFP expansion will provide increased access and excitement and is the right thing for our student-athletes and fans. We look forward to working with our fellow conferences to finalize the important elements of an expanded CFP in order to launch as soon (as) practicable.”\n(Washington State president Kirk Schulz represents the Pac-12 on the CFP’s Board of Managers.)\nOther ramifications of CFP expansion are possible:\n&#8212; Could it make Oregon and Washington, who reportedly have been pursuing Big Ten membership, more interested in remaining in the Pac-12.\nAfter all, access to the CFP would be vastly more difficult in the 16-team Big Ten, with Ohio State, Michigan, Penn State and USC, than in the 10-team Pac-12.\n&#8212; Could the massive influx of cash that will accompany expansion &#8212; hundreds of millions of dollars for the power conferences — give the Pac-12 a means of dangling extra revenue in front of the Huskies and Ducks?\nInstead of adopting an unequal-share model (with revenue from its broadcast contracts), the conference could grant outsized portions of the CFP revenue to whichever teams participate.\n&#8212; Could the limited number of at-large berths (six) prompt the Big Ten to end its pursuit of expansion beyond 16 schools.\nAdding top-tier programs like Oregon and Washington could make CFP access more difficult for the likes of Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan State.\nAnd if the Big Ten doesn’t expand, the likelihood of Pac-12 survival increases dramatically.\nWhile those issues will undoubtedly factor into realignment decisions made over the coming weeks, the next step for the sport is deciding when the expanded playoff will commence.\nIn addition to the access (six conference champs, six at-larges), several other details of the format are known:\n&#8212; The four highest-ranked conference champions, as determined by the selection committee, will be the Nos. 1-4 seeds and receive first-round byes.\n&#8212; The first-round games will be played on the second or third weekends of December.\n&#8212; The four quarterfinals and two semifinals will be played at bowl sites (as is currently the case).\nThe CFP has four years remaining in its contract cycle. The earliest the event would expand is the 2024 season, if there is agreement on the logistics.\n\nSupport the Hotline: Receive three months of unlimited access for just 99 cents.

        "description": "Photo by Greg Fiume/Getty Images\n    \n\n  A number of people deserve blame for the Orioles falling 3.5 games back of the Blue Jays. Anthony Santander isn’t one. On the first play of the first game of Monday’s Orioles-Blue Jays doubleheader, George Springer hit a ground ball that left the bat at 108.6 miles per hour. Orioles shortstop Jorge Mateo made a diving stop to his left to field the grounder, then, while falling off balance, fired a two bounce throw to first baseman Ryan Mountcastle, who stretched about as far as he could to haul in the ball and get out the runner. The crowd erupted. It was an amazing play.\nThis was one of those plays where you could just feel, immediately, that everyone in the stadium was aware of the stakes of the game and what it all meant. It was like “the play” when you get into the late innings of a potential no-hitter. If the entire Orioles team could have carried that kind of energy through into the rest of the game, it would have been an absolute romp. They didn’t. They instead trudged along to a deflating coulda-been-different loss, 7-3.\nYou can point at whatever frustrated or outraged you the most as making the biggest difference in the game. Orioles minor leaguer Mike Baumann, summoned as the extra man for the doubleheader to make his first MLB start, was eminently hittable, allowing eight hits in five innings and 11 batted balls of 95+ miles per hour overall. He did not help very much, or do anything to show that maybe he should take over for the faltering Spenser Watkins down the stretch.\nBaumann was hardly the only culprit. The Orioles had their share of opportunities to really break open the game against their former pitcher Kevin Gausman, making his first not-as-an-Oriole start on Monday afternoon. The O’s capitalized on exactly none of those chances, going 0-8 with runners in scoring position across the whole game. Though Gausman allowed seven hits over 6.2 innings, he did a good job scattering them, allowing just two runs. Crucially, he didn’t walk anyone.\nIn a familiar theme from recent games, this RISP futility included the Orioles failing to score a man from second base with none out in both the fourth and fifth innings, and blowing the chance to bring home a man from second with one out in the sixth. That last one occurred as Ryan Mountcastle doubled off the right field scoreboard - maybe two feet away from getting a home run - and it was bungled by the Jays outfield, allowing Adley Rutschman to score from first on the play. That’s one way to get around RISP problems.\nThe fourth inning was an especially frustrating scene to witness, as Gausman was on the verge of coming unglued after being called for a balk. He had to be restrained by a teammate from getting in the face of the umpire who called the balk. Players have been ejected for less. Perhaps he’s gotten a handle on the meltdowns since being traded away from here. After getting over the initial explosion, Gausman responded by striking out Anthony Santander, Mountcastle, and Ramón Urías in succession. Geez, man. \nIn fairness to Santander, he took four pitches out of the zone in his at-bat, but the ump rung him up on a full count pitch well below the zone. This was a recurring theme in the game. As noted by Orioles beat writer Zachary Silver’s screenshots of the official pitch data, the Orioles batters bore the brunt of outside-the-zone strike calls.\nIn even more fairness to Santander, he homered from both sides of the plate in this game, blasting a Eutaw Street home run for the eighth time in his career off of Gausman in the first inning, then lighting up Jays reliever Tim Mayza in the eighth inning. Both home runs traveled 414 feet. Impressive symmetry. Santander is certainly not part of why the Orioles lost the game. He now has 27 home runs this season.\nPerhaps most deflating of all for Orioles fans is that the game also hinged on Gunnar Henderson - making his just 11th ever professional start at second base - blowing a couple of double play opportunities. These misplays directly led to two Jays runs scoring instead of innings being over. In the third inning, Henderson bobbled the transfer when trying to make a relay throw. In the fifth, he dropped a hard shot right at him, preventing him from starting a 4-6-3 double play.\nNeither one of these shows up in the box score as an error. “You can’t assume the double play,” as they say, no matter how often the plain evidence of your eyes suggests that you could and probably should. Henderson has made some amazing plays as a shortstop already. Maybe he should just play third base and Urías should be the one to play second when Rougned Odor is on the bench. Or maybe Henderson will be just fine at second base whenever called upon for the next month and no one should overreact to one unfortunate game.\nJust to salt the wound a little bit more, the game turned into something of a laugher in the ninth inning when the bad version of DL Hall was called upon to be the “let’s make sure we don’t have to use up any more pitchers while losing with a second game still to play later” pitcher. He did not succeed in this role.\nHall got one out to finish off the eighth inning, then simply blew in the ninth. He faced five batters in the ninth and did not get any outs in the inning. Four hits, one walk; Hall got three of these guys to two strikes but just couldn’t put them away, including an 11-pitch walk to #9 hitter Santiago Espinal. Beau Sulser, freshly called up today, had to come in to get through the ninth.\nWhoever you want to blame and whatever percentage of blame you want to assign around, the fact remains the same. The Orioles could have really used this one, and despite trailing by no fewer than two runs until the ninth inning, it never felt very much like they had a chance to get it. Now, they are 3.5 games back of the Jays in the wild card race with 28 games left to play - including one more today and another three in this series overall. Chances are there to make up for this loss, but not if they keep playing like this.\nJordan Lyles and José Berríos are lined up as the starting pitchers for the second game of the doubleheader. Berríos has struggled this year, bringing a 5.32 ERA into the start. The Orioles hitters need to take advantage, especially since manager Brandon Hyde told reporters before the game that Lyles woke up under the weather and that’s why Lyles didn’t start this game. So who knows what they’re going to get from him.",

        "description": "Aaron Judge provided the tie-breaking, difference-making home run in the Yankees’ win over the Twins. | Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Yankees were sloppy, but the Twins could not capitalize The New York Yankees played a sloppy game on Monday afternoon in the Bronx.\nThe Minnesota Twins were better defensively and on the bases and had more hits and walks combined. But they still managed to lose in a game that didn’t feel as close at the final 5-2 margin.\nAfter a quick 1-2-3 first inning for Yankees starter Jameson Taillon, Aaron Judge laced a one-out double to right-center field. With two down in the inning, Josh Donaldson rocketed a single off the left-field wall, scoring Judge. Donaldson, however, assumed a round-tripper out of the box and didn’t run hard until he reached first based and was gunned down by several feet at second base by Jake Cave.\nNick Gordon and Kyle Garlick both singled in the second inning, but the hits were sandwiched around a Gio Urshela groundball double play and the Twins did no damage.\nThe Twins put a runner in scoring position in the third inning after Gilberto Celestino reached on an error and stole second base, but Carlos Correa struck out swinging to end the threat. Instead, the Yankees doubled their lead in the bottom of the frame as Old Friend Marwin Gonzalez, who entered the game with a sub-.600 OPS, walloped a homer into right field.\nUrshela walked in the fourth with two outs but was stranded after Garlick struck out. Twins starter Chris Archer got out of some trouble of his own in the bottom of the fourth by forcing a Yankees double play.\nThe Twins’ offense finally woke up in the top of the fifth, as Jake Cave walked, bringing former Yankee Gary Sanchez to the dish. Sanchez absolutely demolished a 1-0 fastball, depositing it back into the bleachers in right field; the ball landed a whopping 73 feet from home plate.\nTwo pitches later, Celestino laced a ball off the top of the short wall in right field, missing a home run by a foot or two. Yankees right-fielder Oswaldo Cabrera played it perfectly, gunning Celestino down at second on a close play. After an Arraez popout, Correa and Miranda each singled before Taillon coaxed a flyout from Nick Gordon to end the inning. When it was all said and done, the Twins had four hits and a walk but only managed to score two runs in the fifth.\nArcher faced just three men again in the fifth, getting the Yankees to bang into a double play for the second consecutive inning.\nThe Twins received a gift baserunner again in the sixth, as Donaldson whiffed on an Urshela grounder to start the inning. But the next three runners went down in order, leaving the game tied with the top of the Yankees order coming up in the next inning.\nPredictably, Archer was removed after five innings. Trevor Megill took the mound and promptly gave up a sharp single to Gleyber Torres. Then, it was Judge’s turn to do damage, parking a Megill slider into the second deck down the left-field line. Just like that, it was 4-2 Yankees.\nThe Twins had another runner erased in the top of the seventh inning on a double play. In the bottom, Emilio Pagan did what he often does, allowing a solo home run to Old Friend (kind of) Isiah Kiner-Falefa — only his second round-tripper of the year in 442 plate appearances this year.\nThe Twins couldn’t muster another baserunner over the final two innings, and it ended up being a fairly easy win for the Yankees.\nNotes\n\nThe Twins went down in order in the first, eighth, and ninth innings. In the six innings in between, the Twins had at least one runner on base.\nAll told, the Twins left seven runners on base and grounded into two double plays.\nThe Yankees grounded into three double plays of their own, bringing the game’s total twin-killings to five.\nBetween the two errors, Donaldson’s baserunning mistake in the first inning, and four walks allowed, the Yankees played the sloppier all-around game. But they also won the home-run battle and had a much more effective bullpen outing.\nThe Twins stole two bases and weren’t thrown out attempting to steal, so that was weird.\nLuis Arraez had some poor at-bats in this game, including a give-away swing on a pitch that was a foot outside and a couple of bad swings with runners on base.\nCleveland doesn’t play until 7 p.m. CT, so ... fingers crossed that they continue to be worse than the Twins.\n\nStuds\n\nGary Sanchez: 1-for-4, HR, 2 RBI\nGilberto Celestino: 1-for-2, R, SB, BB\n\nDuds\n\nLuis Arraez: 0-for-4, K\nTrevor Megill: 1 IP, 2 ER, 2 H, BB, HR",

        "description": "The Blue Jays have designated catcher Zack Collins for assignment, tweets Mitch Bannon of Sports Illustrated. The move creates a vacancy on the 40-man roster for reliever Julian Merryweather, who was activated from the 60-day injured list between games of today&#8217;s doubleheader with the Orioles. Righty Casey Lawrence was optioned to Triple-A Buffalo to clear an active roster spot.\nToronto acquired Collins just before Opening Day, swapping backstops with the White Sox in a deal that sent Reese McGuire to Chicago. One of the big appeals for the Jays at the time was that Collins could be optioned to Triple-A, while the out-of-options McGuire had to stick on the MLB active roster. In a Jays organization that also includes Danny Jansen, Alejandro Kirk and top prospect Gabriel Moreno, Collins has had a tough time getting on a big league diamond. He&#8217;s appeared in 26 MLB games this season, hitting only .194/.266/.417 with an untenable 39.2% strikeout rate over 79 trips to the plate.\nThe lefty-hitting backstop has had more success &#8212; albeit in an entirely unconventional way &#8212; in Buffalo. He owns a .195/.361/.398 line through 155 plate appearances with the Bisons. It&#8217;s obviously an unimpressive batting average, but a massive 20.6% walk rate has allowed Collins to get on base at a strong clip in the minors. He&#8217;s also connected on five homers, seven doubles and a triple in 36 Triple-A games.\nPlate discipline and power have long been Collins&#8217; calling cards, and that combination was enough to inspire the White Sox to take him with the #10 overall pick in the 2016 draft. He has an excellent 13% walk rate over 430 MLB plate appearances, but that hasn&#8217;t been enough to compensate for a 33.5% strikeout percentage that has led to a sub-.200 career batting average.\nCollins will now find himself on waivers. With the trade deadline in the rearview mirror, the Jays either have to release him or try to run him through outright waivers. He&#8217;s in his final minor league option year, so an acquiring club could stash him in Triple-A for the rest of this season but would have to carry him on the Opening Day roster in 2023 or make him available to other teams.\nMerryweather, meanwhile, is in position to make his first MLB appearance in a bit less than three months. He&#8217;s been out since June 14 with an abdominal strain, an unfortunate continuation of injury issues that have bothered him throughout his career. Merryweather has also missed time with elbow and oblique issues as a big leaguer, in addition to numerous IL stints as a prospect. The 30-year-old has only 41 MLB appearances as a result, but he&#8217;s flashed a power arsenal when healthy.\nThe right-hander has averaged 97.3 MPH on his fastball this season. That hasn&#8217;t translated to as many whiffs as one might expect, with his 10.7% swinging strike rate through 18 1/3 innings checking in a bit below league average. Merryweather has induced ground-balls at a lofty 52.5% clip, however, and he&#8217;ll offer interim manager John Schneider a power arm to call upon in relief.",

        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Monday signed legislation aimed at creating standards for working conditions for the fast food industry in the state. \n\n\n\nNewsom signed a bill on Labor Day that includes the creation of a 10-member Fast Food Council, all of whom will be appointed by Newsom and other state lawmakers. The council will establish standards on things such as working hours and wages. \n\n\n\n“California is committed to ensuring that the men and women who have helped build our world-class economy are able to share in the state’s prosperity,” Newsom said in a statement.\n\n\n\n“Today’s action gives hardworking fast-food workers a stronger voice and seat at the table to set fair wages and critical health and safety standards across the industry. I’m proud to sign this legislation on Labor Day when we pay tribute to the workers who keep our state running as we build a stronger, more inclusive economy for all Californians.”\n\n\n\nThe bill was lauded by state politicians and groups alike.\n\n\n\n“ICYMI: @CAGovernor has signed landmark labor legislation #AB257 into law, setting the bar for giving workers a say in their wages and empowering them to shape industry standards&nbsp; &nbsp;@ChrisHoldenNews @Fightfor15LA @NorCalFF15 #CALeg,” tweeted SEIU California, whose local unions include janitors, health care workers and others.\n\n\n\n“Thank you @GavinNewsom for signing this landmark bill standing up for workers rights and worker dignity. It can be a model for the country. Thank you to @SEIU workers for your tireless advocacy,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) tweeted.\n\n\n\nNewsom has been widely floated as a possible 2024 Democratic candidate for president, though he has not formally announced any plans. He has prompted more speculation in recent months after he started running ads in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantsi (R) has been floated as a possible GOP presidential candidate, saying “Don’t let them take your freedom.”&nbsp;&nbsp;",

        "description": "Police and local officials in a Maryland county near Washington, D.C., on Monday announced a curfew for youth after a spate of violent crimes in the community and a homicide count that reached a three-decade high last month.\n\n\n\nFor at least 30 days starting this weekend, Prince George's County will implement a curfew for those under 17 years old from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. Sunday through Thursday and 11:59 p.m. and 5 a.m. Friday and Saturday unless they are accompanied by an adult. The curfew is enforced through fines.\n\n\n\nPrince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks said at a news conference that there have been more than 350 carjackings this year, compared to 91 in 2019.\n\n\n\nShe argued there is a problem with the system when police are \"arresting and re-arresting the same children\" who she said are out committing crimes at 3 a.m. \n\n\n\n\"At this point these kids don't just need a hug, they also need to be held accountable,\" the county executive said. \"They must be held accountable.\"\n\n\n\nThe news conference was held after August saw 24 homicides, the single deadliest month for the Maryland county in about three decades, according to police. \n\n\n\nOn Sunday, an 18-month-old girl was shot twice in Glenn Dale, NBC Washington reported. The child survived but suffered critical injuries, authorities said.\n\n\n\nBesides the curfew, Alsobrooks said she is working to tackle the challenge from other angles, including through funding mental health programs at schools and a summer jobs program.\n\n\n\n\"This is just one tool in the toolbox,\" she said of the curfew. \"I cannot stand by and continue to watch children who were shot and killed — [and children] who are not only committing crimes but harming others — and do nothing about it.\"\n\n\n\nIn February, the county executive announced officials were working more closely with the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) in Washington, D.C., to identify repeat offenders.\n\n\n\nLaw enforcement says violent crime has risen across the country, jumping from roughly 380 per 100,000 people in 2019 to about 398 per 100,000 people in 2020, according to the FBI. Data for 2021 is set to come out this fall.\n\n\n\nIn Prince George's County, police have investigated 80 killings this year, although there were 89 homicides last year. \n\n\n\nPolice have also responded to 211 non-fatal shootings so far this year, compared to 209 last year. \n\n\n\nPolice have recovered more than 1,000 firearms in 2022 and arrested around 2,700 offenders in connection to gun-related crimes.\n\n\n\nPrince George's County Police Chief Malik&nbsp;Aziz spoke in support of the curfew on Monday, saying violent criminals \"should not be allowed to reoffend and further victimize our residents.\"\n\n\n\n\"No one should have to tolerate living in fear and being a victim of crime in your own neighborhood,\" Aziz said.",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Yankees got homers from the familiar (Judge) and unfamiliar (IKF, Marwin) in a 5-2 victory. Ball go far, team go far. That has been the mantra of the Yankees in recent seasons, and that’s how they drew it up today. Courtesy of a trio of home runs from Aaron Judge, Marwin Gonzalez, and Isiah Kiner-Falefa, the Yankees held off the Minnesota Twins, 5-2, for their second-straight win.\nJameson Taillon had a tall task ahead of him as he took the mound for the Labor Day matinee. Even if the Yankees lineup had been firing on all cylinders, he was up against a Twins offense that roughed him up in June and which, by all accounts, is a top-five lineup in the American League. But the Yankees’ hitters have been the definition of ice cold, having scored just three runs over the last three days — all by the MVP frontrunner Judge. Taillon’s margin for error was paper-thin.\nFor the most part, Taillon worked well within that margin. He bowled down opposing hitters for the first four innings, not allowing a runner to reach scoring position. The Twins got to him in the fifth, when former batterymate Gary Sánchez blasted a monstrous game-tying, two-run home run into the left-field bleachers — a place that he visited many times during his time in pinstripes. Despite allowing three other hits in the inning, he managed to escape the frame without allowing another run, thanks in large part to strong defense, courtesy of Oswaldo Cabrera’s fourth outfield assist in just his 11th game out there.\n\nOverall, Taillon’s final line wasn’t eye-popping, as he allowed two runs on six hits in five innings, striking out three and walking two. In today’s game, however, in which teams go to their bullpen earlier than ever, that’s virtually a quality start: as noted on the YES broadcast, teams have been 86-60 this season when their starter goes five innings and surrenders two runs.\nOf course, as also noted on the broadcast, the team success can only occur when your offense scores runs for your starter. Fortunately, the Yankees got that memo today. As always, Judge got the ball rolling with one in the first on a double, coming around to score on a Josh Donaldson single off the left-field wall. Being the second-half Yankees, it shouldn’t be surprising that Donaldson got thrown out at second for the third out of the inning because he sauntered out of the box, thinking that he had a home run. Even with that TOOTBLAN, Donaldson gave the Yankees a 1-0 lead.\nTwo innings later, the improbable happened: Marwin Gonzalez homered.\n\nYes, that’s right. Gonzalez, who had not recorded a hit since July 6th, a hit against a non-position player pitcher since July 2nd, or an extra-base hit since June 28th, sent one into the right-field seats. A moonshot it was not, traveling just 364 feet, having an exit velocity of just 97.0 mph and an xBA on the interstate (.140). It was a run all the same, however, giving the Yankees an early 2-0 lead.\nThe Twins caused a scare when Sánchez hit the aforementioned bomb to knot the game at 2-2 and nearly took the lead in the fifth. But in the home half of the sixth, the probable happened: Aaron Judge homered.\n\nAt this point in the season, I’m running out of adjectives to describe Judge homers. The stats, as always, are mindboggling: 109.6 mph exit velocity, 404 feet, .840 xBA. It was historic, tying Alex Rodriguez for the most home runs in a season by a Yankees right-handed hitter with 54. Most importantly, it was two runs, as Gleyber Torres had led off the inning with a single to right field, giving the Yankees a 4-2 lead.\nThe next inning, the almost-impossible happened: Isiah Kiner-Falefa homered.\n\nIt was just IKF’ss second home run of the season and his first in 58 games at Yankee Stadium, but it couldn’t come at a better time for the much-maligned shortstop, who has been criticized for his defense and mired in a slump (.200/.286/.260 slash since August 14th) while watching New York promote two possible replacements (Cabrera and Oswald Peraza). It was 99 mph off the bat, 370 feet into the seats, and good for a 5-2 lead.\nAnd that’s all that the Yankees would need. Greg Weissert, Wandy Peralta, and Clay Holmes would combine for four scoreless innings. Things got a little sticky in the seventh, as Weissert walked Gilberto Celestino and Carlos Correa to put runners on first and second with one out; Peralta, however, induced a 5-5-3 double play off the bat of Jose Miranda to end the threat.\n\nNot everything about this game was positive. Jose Trevino continued his slump by grounding into a pair of double plays, while both Donaldson and Gonzalez added extra stress to the pitching staff with a pair of errors. Most importantly, Giancarlo Stanton fouled a ball off his toe and although he finished the at-bat, he was removed from the game (postgame X-rays on his foot were negative). Much like yesterday’s win being followed by the news that Andrew Benintendi needed surgery, it seems like the Yankees just can’t win without some kind of loss these days.\nAt the end of the day, though, a win is a win (just as Matt said yesterday). Weissert gets credit for the victory, improving to 2-0, while Trevor Megill falls to 3-2 and Holmes earns his 19th save. With the Red Sox and Rays still playing, the 81-54 Yankees will at worst remain five games up in the division, and could stretch their lead to six.\nThe Yankees and Twins continue their series tomorrow night, with Gerrit Cole up against Joe Ryan as New York looks to clinch its 30th consecutive winning season. First pitch is scheduled for 7:05 pm ET, and will be an Amazon Prime-exclusive game.\nBox Score.",

        "description": "Michael Chow/The Republic / USA TODAY NETWORK\n    \n\n  The D-backs start their quest for a fourth series win in a row, as Ryne Nelson makes his debut. \n\nToday's Lineups\n\n\n\n\nDIAMONDBACKS\nPADRES\n\n\n\n\nCarson Kelly - C\nJurickson Profar - LF\n\n\nJosh Rojas - DH\nJuan Soto - RF\n\n\nKetel Marte - 2B\nManny Machado - 3B\n\n\nChristian Walker - 1B\nJosh Bell - 1B\n\n\nEmmanuel Rivera - 3B\nJake Cronenworth - 2B\n\n\nJake McCarthy - RF\nHa-Seong Kim - SS\n\n\nStone Garrett - LF\nMatt Beaty - DH\n\n\nAlek Thomas - CF\nTrent Grisham - CF\n\n\nGeraldo Perdomo - SS\nAustin Nola - C\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyne Nelson - RHP\nBlake Snell - LHP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoster moves\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks made the following roster moves:\n\nSelected RHP Ryne Nelson (No. 52) from Triple-A Reno\nRecalled INF Yonny Hernandez from Reno and placed him on the 60-day injured list (strained left calf).\nOptioned RHP Luis Frias to Reno following yesterday’s game.\nThe D-backs’ 40-man roster remains at 40.\n\nA Triple-A 5.43 ERA would not typically get a promotion to the major-leagues. But there's reason to hope for better from Ryne Nelson. Firstly, is the oft-discussed environment of the Pacific Coast League. Just as it inflates hitters' numbers causing unrealistic expectations, so pitchers look worse than they are. The collective ERA there this year is, coincidentally, also 5.43, compared to the current MLB figure of 3.97. That will go quite some way to countering the higher quality of hitters Nelson will be seeing today. It may be no coincidence the team chose San Diego for his debut: per ESPN, it is the most pitcher-friendly park in the majors this year [Starting today means he’ll miss Coors too, given Arizona’s six-man rotation].\nIt's also reported Nelson tweaked his mechanics earlier in the season. Specifically, he was reaching too far back on each pitch, and this was affecting the results. After some changes were made, according to pitching coordinator Dan Carlson, “The carry came back. The command came back. And also the breaking ball got much, much sharper and then with the slider and change, he was able to keep those things in the strike zone.” Through May 24, Nelson had a 7.34 ERA and had allowed 10 home-runs in barely 40 innings of work. Over 17 starts since, the ERA for Ryne has been 4.61, significantly below the PCL average, with an improved home-run rate.\nHis walk- and strikeout-rates are both a bit below PCL average. That suggests we will potentially see more balls in play - given Arizona’s defensive prowess of late, it may not be a bad thing. While caution should be exercised with AAA stats (once more, due to the weird environment), Nelson appears to be quite fly-ball skewing, with a GB% of only 36%, lower than the 43% MLB average, so could keep our outfielders busy. While I haven’t seen a line-up yet (what’s above is getting plugged in nearer game-time!), I would not be surprised to see Torey Lovullo go with his best defensive trio out there this afternoon, to give Nelson the best chance of success.",

        "description": "This group of Black Sox chuckleheads got themselves banned from baseball, sending the White Sox into what would become a three-decade tailspin. | Chicago Sun-Times/Chicago Daily News collection/Chicago History Museum/Getty Images\n    \n\n  In all likelihood, 2022 cannot end worse for the South Siders than 1921, 1918, 1984 — or even 2013! The White Sox have 122 years of history, but they have not been a team of extremes. Sure, there have been just three World Series titles — and one World Series loss! Likewise, just 12 first place finishes (9.8% of the time) — and eight last-place endings (6.6%).\nSo it’s tempting to think of this year’s fall from a 93-win division winner to the current pace of 81-81 — a drop of 12 wins — as being both devastating and unprecedented in franchise annals.\nBut no, in fact, it is not so. There have been more crushing seasons, including one this century.\nLet’s get the good news out of the way: In order for the 2022 White Sox to crack the Top 10 Most Disappointing White Sox Clubs of All Time and These Are the Raw Unfeeling Numbers Here Not Your Tears Dripping Into a Nacho Helmet or Running Over Your Luis-Eloy Bobblehead, the White Sox will have to lose three-quarters of their games (finish 7-21). As angry as we all might be at this summer’s careening clown car, it is extremely unlikely that such a September surprise awaits.\nWhat were the 10 biggest soul-crushing White Sox clubs of all time? Glad you’re here. Dry your eyes, and let’s take a look.\n\n1903 White Sox\nWinning Percentage Drop 114 pointsWins Drop 14Standings Drop 4th to 7th\nThe White Sox franchise started out gangbusters, winning the AL pennant in 1900 (pre-majors) and again in 1901 (no World Series). In 1902, the club fell to fourth place, but at just eight games back, the race was tight. In 1903, Clark Griffith exited as pitcher-manager and Jimmy Callahan took over a younger club. A healthy run differential in 1902 gave way to a -97. This was a White Sox team in transition; and it wouldn’t be this bad again (AL placing or winning percentage) for almost two decades.\n1978 White Sox\nWinning Percentage Drop 115 pointsWins Drop 19Standings Drop 3rd to 5th\nBetcha didn’t see this one coming. Bill Veeck’s 1977 Rent-a-Player success ran out of gas in September, and because it gave way to three following years of shoestring budget slapdashery in 16´´softballing duds it’s easy to forget how far off the cliff the White Sox fell pre-Jerry Reinsdorf. With the South Side Hit Men, Veeck and GM Roland Hemond could almost do no wrong; Oscar Gamble, Steve Stone, Richie Zisk, the front office sneezed and a curtain-call worthy player popped out of the dugout. Even a marquee trade, Bucky Dent to the Bronx, yielded a big prize years later in LaMarr Hoyt. In 1978, the same plan was rolled out, but Ron Blomberg, Bobby Bonds and Claudell Washington just didn’t have the same ring to them. Even Stone, who had come back to the Sox and Veeck out of appreciation for the gamble taken on him, had similar peripherals but saw his WAR cut in half.\n1938 White Sox\nWinning Percentage Drop 119 pointsWins Drop 21Standings Drop 3rd to 6th\nThough tied with 1948, the 1937 White Sox actually being a decent team (81-70-2) climbing the ladder over three seasons from fifth to fourth to third, qualifies it as more devastating, especially given that it had been 16 seasons since the White Sox had finished as high as third place. This bottoming-out in 1938 also signaled terrible times to come, as the White Sox would finish as high as third just one time in the next 14 seasons and in the first division (1st-4th) of the AL only five times in 14 years. We might think 2013-19 was agony, but the true dark ages in White Sox history stretch for virtually all of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Cap-tip your pops, or your grandpappy, or great-grandpa for sticking it out; or question their intelligence, your choice.\n1948 White Sox\nWinning Percentage Drop 119 pointsWins Drop 19Standings Drop 6th to 8th\nOne one hand, the 1948 White Sox represent a low ebb after nearly three decades of drowning, as just the fourth White Sox team in 49 years of existence to finish dead last. But it also represents the final super-low for the franchise for more than 20 years to come. It took a few more years, but a streak of 17 straight winning seasons was on the horizon.\nBut now that a few have already popped up, let’s talk for a second about the ugliness of 8s for the White Sox. In only three seasons ending in 8 — 1908, 1958, and 2008 —have the White Sox owned a winning record. And five of the biggest dream-crushers in team history have come in “8” years.\n1995 White Sox\nWinning Percentage Drop 121 pointsWins Drop 20 (based on 162-game seasons in 1994 and 1995)Standings Drop 4th to 8th\nThe 1995 campaign, as you’ll see also in 1918, is bastardized by a lack of a full season. However, unlike 1918 being truncated by World War, the mid-90s void was forced by greedy ownership colluding and otherwise unwilling to share the wealth of the game with players. That said, the fall from “World Series favorite” (um, the White Sox weren’t even the best team in the AL when play stopped in 1994, 3 1⁄2 games behind the Yankees, and tied for third-best in baseball with Atlanta) to Bevington’s Bumblers was exceedingly ugly. The presumed dominance of the 1990s “window of contention” was killed by labor strife, which is even grosser than what is happening here in the 2020s (with just “mini” labor strife).\n1968 White Sox\nWinning Percentage Drop 135 pointsWins Drop 22Standings Drop 4th to 8th\nMy gut might have picked this drop as the worst-ever, because it just seemed so devastating. The White Sox hadn’t had a losing season since 1950, and what’s more, they didn’t really come CLOSE to a losing season in that 17-year span (OK, one season just four games better than .500, we’d kill for that these days). So the fall from 89-73 last-second pennant heartbreakers in 1967 to 67-95 — at the time, the fifth-most losses in franchise history — was absolutely bonkers. The magic of GM Ed Short (demonstrated by retooling the franchise on the fly in the early 1960s) had worn off completely, and the White Sox were heading into the darkest seasons in their history. Thankfully, the darkness was brief.\n2013 White Sox\nWinning Percentage Drop 136 pointsWins Drop 22Standings Drop 2nd to 5th\nThis one snuck right up on me, because it’s so easy to forget that the 2012 Shadow Ball Ventura charges were so good and dominant all season. In all but one week’s worth of 2012 games from May 29 to September 25 the White Sox were in first place, only to collapse by losing 11 of their last 15. The next year, the team’s offense went completely flat, and the White Sox spent all year in free-fall, eventually inviting the misery that became the 2010s rebuild.\n1984 White Sox\nWinning Percentage Drop 154 pointsWins Drop 25Standings Drop 1st to 5th\nMy vote for most crushing season, as you would need to be about 105 years old to have experienced a worse one. The Winning Ugly White Sox had won 99 games and, more than that, CRUSHED AL West competition by 20 games. Twenty games! How does a team that has a 1983 like it did turn around and just drop 25 games, with largely the same personnel? The pitching staff stayed just as productive, but the hitting was only half as good, with special citations issued for Carlton Fisk (dropped 2.8 WAR), Rudy Law (-3.1), Greg Luzinski (-2.6) and Tom Paciorek (-1.3). And even still, the 1984 team did make a valiant charge to first place, holding it for two days in early July before finishing the season 30-48 and collapsing to fifth place, 10 games out.\n1918 White Sox\nWinning Percentage Drop 189 pointsWins Drop 28 (projecting to a 156-game season in 1918)Standings Drop 1st to 6th\nThere was a lot going on in the late teens, even as the White Sox were ascending to best in the majors. The 1917 team, winning 100 games and by a full five games better than any White Sox team ever, was always going to be a hard act to follow. But a championship season hangover plus a season interrupted by war service and illness (Joe Jackson, one of many, missed essentially the whole season in the service and was harangued for taking a shipbuilding job Stateside vs. soldiering) resulted in a catastrophic drop in the standings. Worse, the truncated season (ending in early September) saw the World Series played at Comiskey Park — with the Cubs as host!\n1921 White SoxWinning Percentage Drop 219 pointsWins Drop 34 Standings Drop 2nd to 7th\nWell, this fortune turn was the worst of all time, but is the only one that can be easily explained. The 1920 White Sox were a terrific team (third-best in White Sox history, and the only one of the seven-best South Side clubs to not see the postseason) that only lost a second straight AL pennant in the season’s final days. With just three games left, the White Sox were within a half-game of the pennant, but the South Siders dropped two of three at the mediocre St. Louis Browns, and ended up two games short. However, that collapse was for a reason: Very late in the year, Kenesaw Landis had banned the core of the club from ever playing in the majors again. Not only did the gutted club in 1921 pave the way for the Yankees to begin romping all over the AL, it was the start of three decades of futility on the South Side. (One odd note, while the 1921 White Sox were the 11th-worst club in team history, they did not finish in last place in the AL; the woebegone Philadelphia A’s, who did not have the excuse of their core banished from the game, finished 8 1⁄2 games worse than the White Sox!)",

        "description": "Anxiety, autism, schizophrenia, and Tourette syndrome each have their own distinguishing characteristics, but a new study asks if circadian rhythm disruption may bridge these and most other mental disorders.\nIn a new study in the journal Translational Psychiatry, scientists hypothesize that circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) is a psychopathology factor that a broad range of mental illnesses share. Research into its molecular foundation could be key to unlocking better therapies and treatments.\n&#8220;Circadian rhythms play a fundamental role in all biological systems at all scales, from molecules to populations,&#8221; says senior author Pierre Baldi, professor of computer science at the University of California, Irvine. &#8220;Our analysis found that circadian rhythm disruption is a factor that broadly overlaps the entire spectrum of mental health disorders.&#8221;\nLead author Amal Alachkar, a neuroscientist and professor of teaching in the pharmaceutical sciences department, notes the challenges of testing the hypothesis at the molecular level but says thoroughly examining peer-reviewed literature on the most prevalent mental health disorders provided ample evidence of the connection.\n&#8220;The telltale sign of circadian rhythm disruption—a problem with sleep—was present in each disorder,&#8221; Alachkar says. &#8220;While our focus was on widely known conditions including autism, ADHD, and bipolar disorder, we argue that the CRD psychopathology factor hypothesis can be generalized to other mental health issues, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, food addiction, and Parkinson&#8217;s disease.&#8221;\nCircadian rhythms regulate our bodies&#8217; physiological activity and biological processes during each solar day. Synchronized to a 24-hour light/dark cycle, circadian rhythms influence when we normally need to sleep and when we&#8217;re awake.\nThey also manage other functions such as hormone production and release, body temperature maintenance, and consolidation of memories. Effective, undisrupted operation of this natural timekeeping system is necessary for the survival of all living organisms, the paper&#8217;s authors say.\nCircadian rhythms are intrinsically sensitive to light/dark cues, so they can be easily disrupted by light exposure at night, and the level of disruption appears to be sex-dependent and changes with age. One example is a hormonal response to CRD felt by pregnant women; both the mother and the fetus can experience clinical effects from CRD and chronic stress.\n&#8220;An interesting issue that we explored is the interplay of circadian rhythms and mental disorders with sex,&#8221; says Baldi, director of the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics. &#8220;For instance, Tourette syndrome is present primarily in males, and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease is more common in females by a ratio of roughly two-thirds to one-third.&#8221;\nAge also is an important factor, according to scientists, as CRD can affect neurodevelopment in early life in addition to leading to the onset of aging-related mental disorders among the elderly.\nAn important unresolved issue centers on the causal relationship between CRD and mental health disorders, Baldi says. Is CRD a key player in the origin and onset of these maladies or a self-reinforcing symptom in the progression of disease?\nTo answer this and other questions, the researchers suggest an examination of CRD at the molecular level using transcriptomic (gene expression) and metabolomic technologies in mouse models.\n&#8220;This will be a high-throughput process with researchers acquiring samples from healthy and diseased subjects every few hours along the circadian cycle,&#8221; Baldi says. &#8220;This approach can be applied with limitations in humans, since only serum samples can really be used, but it could be applied on a large scale in animal models, particularly mice, by sampling tissues from different brain areas and different organs, in addition to serum. These are extensive, painstaking experiments that could benefit from having a consortium of laboratories.&#8221;\nHe adds that if the experiments occur in a systematic way with respect to age, sex, and brain areas to investigate circadian molecular rhythmicity before and during disease progression, it would help the mental health research community identify potential biomarkers, causal relationships, and novel therapeutic targets and avenues.\nAdditional coauthors are from the University of California, Los Angeles; and UC Irvine. The National Institutes of Health provided financial support.\nSource: UC Irvine\nThe post Hypothesis: Circadian rhythm links mental disorders appeared first on Futurity.",

President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that a nuclear power plant is “one step away from a radiation disaster” because Russian shelling damaged one of its power transmission lines on Monday.\n\n\n\n“Today the last power transmission line connecting the plant to the energy system of Ukraine was damaged due to another Russian provocative shelling. Again — this is the second time — due to Russian provocation, the Zaporizhzhia plant is one step away from a radiation disaster,” Zelensky said during a presidential address.\n\n\n\n“I consider the fact that Russia is doing this right now, right on the eve of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] conclusions, very eloquent. Shelling the territory of the ZNPP [Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant] means that the terrorist state does not care what the IAEA says, it does not care what the international community decides. Russia is interested only in keeping the situation the worst for the longest time possible,” he continued.\n\n\n\nThe Ukrainian president urged the international community to recognize Moscow as a terrorist state and to bolster sanctions against it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe IAEA separately issued an update on Monday saying that Ukraine had reached out to the agency to let the IAEA know that a backup power line, connected in part to the ZNPP, needed to be disconnected in order to address a fire but that there were no damages.\n\n\n\nThe developments come as two IAEA experts are set to remain on-site to monitor the nuclear power plant as the Russian military has shelled the Zaporizhzhia plant for the last month, creating fears of a possible nuclear incident.\n\n\n\n“Director General [Raphael Mariano] Grossi will on Tuesday issue a report about the nuclear safety, security and safeguards situation in Ukraine – including the findings from the mission to the ZNPP – and later the same day brief the United Nations Security Council about the mission to the plant,” the IAEA said in its update.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Canadian police announced on Monday that one of the two men suspected of fatally stabbing 10 people and wounding more than a dozen others in the province of Saskatchewan had been found dead.\n\n\n\nBrothers Damien Sanderson, 31 and Myles Sanderson, 30, face charges of first-degree murder, attempted murder and breaking and entering in connection to the Sunday stabbings. \n\n\n\nSaskatchewan Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Commanding Officer Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore said in a statement on Monday that Damien Sanderson had been found dead earlier that morning. Authorities are still searching for Myles Sanderson.\n\n\n\n\"His body was located outdoors, in a heavily grassed area in proximity to a house being investigated. We can confirm he has visible injuries, not believed to be self-inflicted at this point. The exact cause of death will be determined in conjunction with the Saskatchewan Coroner's Office with a date and time to be determined,\" Blackmore said.\n\n\n\n\"Myles Sanderson, Damien's brother, may have sustained injuries, this has not been confirmed. We want the public to know this because there is a possibility he may seek medical attention,\" she added. \"Even if he is injured, it does not mean he is not still dangerous. Myles has a lengthy criminal record involving both persons and property crimes.\"\n\n\n\nThe development came hours after warrants for the two men's arrests were issued.\n\n\n\nPolice received the first report of a stabbing around 5:40 a.m. on Sunday. The suspects allegedly attacked the victims at 13 different locations.\n\n\n\nBlackmore said in a statement that hundreds of law enforcement personnel were working aggressively to apprehend the suspects.\n\n\n\n\"To the people of Saskatchewan and beyond, please be assured that we are using every human, investigational and technological resource we have available to locate and arrest the persons responsible for this tragedy and to ensure your safety,\" she said.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 7:50 p.m.",

        "description": "Steve Blass speaks on being inducted into the inaugural Hall of Fame class for the Pittsburgh Pirates. | Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Nineteen former members of the Pirates organization are immortalized in the team’s inaugural Hall of Fame class. Though the Pittsburgh Pirates have struggled through yet another disappointing season, it is worth mentioning that the club has a rich history that covers 135 years. Several World Series titles, all-time great players and contributors, and the impact the team has had on the city helps them standout as a staple in Major League Baseball. Those players and contributors were finally formally recognized as the Pirates’ inaugural Hall of Fame class was enshrined and immortalized in plaques outside of PNC Park.\nThis inaugural class features 19 players, 16 of which are already members of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. Of the 19 members, there are only three surviving players, all of which were present at the ceremony. Steve Blass, Bill Mazeroski, and Dave Parker all spoke at the ceremony, as they were inducted and donned the yellow Hall of Fame jacket that symbolizes their impact on the community and their incredible careers as members of the Pirates’ organization. \nBill Mazeroski lays claim to one of the all-time great moments in baseball with his walk off homerun in game seven of the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees. It was the first time a World Series had been decided with a homerun, and still the only time it would take place to win a game seven in the championship series. \nObviously, that’s a huge highlight, but Mazeroski was really well known for being a sound defender at second base, playing for the Pirates from 1956-1972, winning eight Gold Glove awards. Mazeroski had his jersey retired by the Pirates in 1987 and was inducted into Cooperstown in 2001.\n  \n        \n      Photo by Bruce Bennett Studios via Getty Images Studio/Getty Images\n      Bill Mazeroski rounds third after hitting his iconic homerun to win the 1960 World Series.\n  \nSteve Blass has been a fixture in the Pirates’ organization for 60 years. Blass would play in 1964, and then from 1966-1974 all with Pittsburgh and became an icon for his pitching prowess. \nBy far the most memorable part of Blass’ career came during the 1971 World Series against the favored Baltimore Orioles. Blass would throw two complete games in game three and game seven of the series, helping the Pirates mightily to win the title. \nFollowing his playing career, Blass joined the Pirates broadcast team in 1983 and was calling games until 2019 when he retired after six decades with the team.\n  \n        \n      Photo by Justin Berl/Getty Images\n      Steve Blass is honored following his retirement from the Pirates’ broadcast team and 60 years with the franchise.\n  \nDave Parker was a transcendent athlete in Major League Baseball and provided plenty of highlights for the Pirates from 1973-1983. “The Cobra” was well known for his powerful arm and batting ability. \nParker was a seven-time All-Star, two-time batting champion, National League MVP, and two-time World Series champion, once with the Pirates in 1979. \nParker became just the second athlete to earn an average of $1 million per year, which garnered much criticism from fans after some lackluster years for Pittsburgh. Despite that, Parker retired with a .290 batting average, with 2712 hits, and his 166 home runs puts him top 10 all time for the club.\n  \n        \n      Photo by Focus on Sport/Getty Images\n      Dave Parker at the plate against the Chicago Cubs\n  \nAlongside the incredible Pirate’s players that were inducted were several members of the Negro Baseball League who all played in the area for either the Pittsburgh Crawfords or the Homestead Grays. Owner Bob Nutting touched on the impact and the legacy of those players and how important it is that they receive this recognition. \nRay Brown, Oscar Charleston, Josh Gibson and Buck Leonard were the Negro League players that were inducted into the Pirates’ Hall of Fame, and throughout their careers were praised for their incredible accolades despite never given the opportunity to play in the MLB.\nWith the recent struggles that the club has had, it is a breath of fresh air to have something surrounding the Pirates be celebrated, and this team Hall of Fame is long overdue. It is somewhat of a shame that there are only three surviving members to be recognized, but through 135 years of Pirates’ baseball, these 19 members are forever immortalized as legends of the game in the city of Pittsburgh.\nIn total, the inaugural class includes Honus Wagner, Paul Waner, Lloyd Waner, Fred Clarke, Jake Beckley, Max Carey, Pie Traynor, Roberto Clemente, Ralph Kiner, Arky Vaughan, Willie Stargell, Bill Mazeroski, Josh Gibson, Ray Brown, Buck Leonard, Oscar Charleston, Dave Parker, Danny Murtaugh and Steve Blass.",

        "description": "Photo by Jamie Sabau/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Relevant baseball is happening, even if the Mets/Pirates game was postponed Here are the relevant games on the schedule for today:\nThe Blue Jays took Game 1 of a doubleheader in Baltimore, 7-3. However, the Yankees beat the Twins, 5-2 to maintain their lead. The second game of that doubleheader is ongoing, with the Orioles currently holding a 1-0 lead.\nThe Red Sox hold a 3-2 lead over the Rays in the fifth at the time of writing, which could push the Rays back a game if the score holds. \nThe Brewers trail the Rockies, 3-2, in the sixth. A loss to the Rockies during what should be an easy and profitable week for them would really further ding up Milwaukee’s dwindling playoff odds.\nThe Padres host the Diamondbacks, with 2019 second-round pick Ryne Nelson set to make his MLB debut against Blake Snell. \nI picked the White Sox-Mariners Lance Lynn/Marco Gonzales game as the key game to watch today, so maybe check that out. The White Sox can gain a game on the Twins with a win, as can the Guardians if they’re able to beat the Royals by sending Triston McKenzie against Brady Singer.",

        "description": "It’s put up or shut up time for this Yankees squad, and we want to know if you think they can do it. The brief glimpse of hope near the end of August has already sputtered out on this team. The Yankees avoided the worst-case scenario of getting swept by the Rays, but have otherwise put themselves in prime position to hand away the division that they’ve had in their back pocket since May. Their upcoming homestand will be crucial to seeing if they’ll be playing from behind for the final weeks of the year or if they can prevent a full-blown crash and burn.\nThe problem with the team is clear — outside of Aaron Judge, the offense is doing next to nothing. A few players are trying to work through injuries, others are trying to find a groove after rehabbing from injury, and others have been black holes in the lineup all year. The team has already played their cards in calling up a pair of infield prospects, so is there anything else they can do to the roster itself? Are there adjustments that the coaching staff can find, or is it truly just up to the players to perform better? If you’ve got questions like these, or any other concerns, be sure to send them in for a chance to be featured in our Yankees mailbag.\nAnswers will run on Friday morning. All questions received by the night of September 8th will be considered. You can leave your submissions in the comment section below or by e-mail to pinstripealleyblog [at] gmail [dot] com.",

        "description": "The White Sox announced that reliever Aaron Bummer and third baseman Yoán Moncada have been reinstated from the injured list prior to this afternoon&#8217;s game against the Mariners. Outfielders Adam Haseley and Mark Payton were optioned to Triple-A Charlotte to create active roster space. Bummer had been on the 60-day injured list, so the Sox needed to clear a 40-man roster spot for him. That&#8217;s been achieved by sending righty Tobias Myers &#8212; whom the club hadn&#8217;t previously announced was designated for assignment &#8212; outright to Charlotte after he went unclaimed on waivers.\nBummer is in position to make his first MLB appearance in three months. The left-hander last pitched on June 7, then landed on the IL with a left lat strain a couple days later. Bummer&#8217;s absence led the Chicago front office to target southpaw bullpen help in advance of the trade deadline, and they eventually sent catcher Reese McGuire to Boston for Jake Diekman. Bummer will reassume his role as the primary lefty for acting manager Miguel Cairo, as he&#8217;d been off to another strong start. Through 17 2/3 innings, he posted a 3.06 ERA with a solid 26.3% strikeout rate and an elite 58.3% ground-ball percentage.\nMoncada missed the minimum amount of time after suffering a left hamstring strain during the final few days of August. It was the third IL stint of the year for the switch-hitting infielder, who also landed on the shelf with an oblique injury and a strain of his other hamstring earlier in the year. Those injures have seemingly prevented Moncada from getting into any sort of groove, as he&#8217;s slumped to a career-worst .197/.269/.313 line over 324 plate appearances this season.\nThe Sox added Myers on deadline day, claiming him off waivers from the Giants. The 24-year-old has started five games with Charlotte since then, allowing a staggering 16 runs (15 earned) with 11 walks and eight strikeouts. It&#8217;s the continuation of a nightmarish season for Myers, who has worked exclusively at Triple-A between the Guardians, Giants and White Sox organizations. He owns a 7.35 ERA in 71 frames between the three clubs&#8217; top affiliates.\nThose struggles have come largely out of nowhere, as Myers posted a slid 3.90 ERA with a huge 30.5% strikeout rate in 117 2/3 innings between Double-A and Triple-A in 2021. That led Cleveland to acquire him from the Rays last November and immediately add him to the 40-man roster to keep him from being selected in the Rule 5 draft, but things have since unexpectedly gone backwards. Myers, who has yet to make his MLB debut, will now have to try to work his way back onto a 40-man roster. He&#8217;ll be eligible for minor league free agency at the end of this year if Chicago doesn&#8217;t first reselect him onto the 40-man.",

        "description": "No wonder Miguel Cairo is smiling. | Jamie Sabau/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Will the M’s be able to stay awake? Yesterday’s loss may have kept interim manager Miguel Cairo from keeping his undefeated record (we don’t charge him with Tuesday’s loss in a game where the lineup and prep was done by the HOFBP before heading off on with an alleged medical problem — that’s like a reliever coming in with a 3-0 count on the batter), but the more important game of the day was the one in Cleveland.\nThat’s because:\n\nThe Guardians lost, so the White Sox didn’t lose any ground\nThe game started late for an afternoon contest, then had a 4 1⁄2 - hour rain delay and lasted 11 innings, ending at 11 p.m. Eastern, so the Mariners barely got to the airport before their charter expired and must have sailed into their home port just about in time to head to the locker room\nThe delay came in the top of the fourth, so with the extra innings every Mariners reliever made an appearance\n\nAll told, if the Mariners play tonight like they fell asleep on the bases or in the field, it will probably be because they really did fall asleep. Either that, or they’ll be so full of Red Bull their whole bodies will be shaking, which is not generally conducive to good baseball. For a team that relies on solid pitching and defense, neither is a good situation.\nTaking advantage of the presumably sleepwalking Seattle lineup will be the job of Lance Lynn, who still sports nasty season stats like a 4.70 ERA, but had a solid August, giving up just 10 earned runs in 36 2⁄3 innings.\nAnother break for the Sox today is facing Marco Gonzalez, probably the weakest of Seattle’s starters, and also a lefty. Gonzalez has a 3.99 ERA but much worse FIP, and whose ERA in August was 5.08. Gonzalez will be throwing a five-pitch repertoire, where the changeup is his favorite, all thrown softly enough to be crafty-leftyish except he’s apparently not all that crafty, to a White Sox lineup that features the return of Luis Robert from an injury and paternity leave hiatus:\n  \n        \n  \nLynn takes on a Mariners lineup that hits for power, with four usual starters with 18 or more long balls. But Seattle’s No. 1 HR and RBI man, Eugenio Suarez, has the day — or at least the start — off in favor of old buddy Jake Lamb. Control will be a key, because the Mariners are only 12th in the league in average, but second in walks.\n  \n        \n  \nDealing with leadoff hitter Julio Rodriguez will be the big challenge, because Rodriguez has both 23 dingers and 24 stolen bases.\nIn roster news, Aaron Bummer and Yoán Moncada are both back from the IL, with Mark Payton and Adam Haseley sent down to make room. Also, space was made on the 40-man roster with the DFA (and reassignment to Charlotte after going unclaimed) of righty starter Tobias Meyers.\nFirst pitch is scheduled for 5:40 p.m. Central. Idiot box coverage is back at NBC Sports Channel, but who might be in the booth is anybody’s guess. Minnesota was kind enough to lose to the Yankees this afternoon, so there’s ground to be made up on the Twins.",

        "description": "The rise in cyberattacks this year has forced many companies in critical sectors to make improvements to&nbsp;their cyber defenses&nbsp;in an effort to&nbsp;secure their networks from hacks.\n\n\n\nSuch companies are increasing their investments in cybersecurity and seeking to hire&nbsp;more cyber professionals&nbsp;— a task proving to be challenging amid a shortage of cyber workers across industries.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill&nbsp;spoke to several security experts and industry leaders in the financial, health care and energy sectors to gauge how those critical industries are&nbsp;seeking&nbsp;to keep their networks secure amid the growing number of cyberattacks.\n\n\n\nIn the health care sector, which has seen a spike in ransomware this year targeting hospitals and other health&nbsp;care facilities,&nbsp;Christopher Plummer, a senior cybersecurity architect at Dartmouth Health, said having a cybersecurity program is crucial for hospitals, as they hold sensitive information — including patient data.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut&nbsp;he estimated that only about 10 to 20 percent of the nation’s hospitals have a dedicated cybersecurity program.\n\n\n\nA&nbsp;recent report&nbsp;from Kroll, an investigation and risk consulting firm, found a 90 percent increase in the number of attacks against health care organizations in the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith cyberattacks&nbsp;increasing, the sector has had to increase its resources to fund cybersecurity programs and hire more cyber professionals&nbsp;to work on securing its networks and systems from attacks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think many HDOs [health delivery organizations] just don’t know exactly where they’re supposed to be in terms of human resources when it comes to cybersecurity — they just know they need people,” Plummer said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe pandemic has also put a strain on a sector that “was already in a very tough place with respect to security resources,” said Plummer.\n\n\n\nThe surge in attacks has also led lawmakers to urge the Biden administration&nbsp;to strengthen the federal government’s cyber defenses in the sector.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a letter&nbsp;addressed to the Department of Health and Human Services, Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) and Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) last month urged the agency to better protect the health care and public health sector from the growing number of cyber threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Ransomware attacks on the [health care and public health] sector have skyrocketed in the past two years as opportunistic criminals recognized that hospitals may pay quickly to resolve issues and protect patient safety,” the lawmakers said in the letter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"We remain concerned, however, about the lack of robust and timely sharing of actionable threat information with industry partners and the need to dramatically scale up the Department’s capabilities and resources. With cyber threats growing exponentially, we must prioritize addressing the HPH sector’s cybersecurity gaps.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy&nbsp;comparison, the financial industry has traditionally been ahead of other sectors when it comes to having a robust cybersecurity system.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Given that financial services rely on customer trust for its business and has long been highly regulated, the sector is more mature than many others in terms of cybersecurity and preparedness,” said Teresa Walsh, the global head of intelligence&nbsp;for the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the industry has also recently faced a wave of cyberattacks:&nbsp;In particular, the cryptocurrency sector has been a high interest target this year as hackers found ways to steal millions of dollars in virtual currency.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOver the summer, two crypto firms said hackers stole more than $100 million worth of digital currency. The companies said at the time that they were partnering up with&nbsp;law enforcement to try to track down the hackers and retrieve the stolen funds.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe hacks also led the Treasury Department to&nbsp;impose sanctions&nbsp;in August against cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash for helping hackers launder more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe agency said Tornado Cash allowed cyber groups, including North Korean-backed hackers, to use its platform to launder the proceeds of cybercrimes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmid such attacks,&nbsp;David Roque, senior vice president at USI Insurance Services, an insurance brokerage and consulting firm,&nbsp;said he’s&nbsp;seen “clients allocating higher funds for security.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRoque added that financial services, particularly those in the crypto sector, are also looking to purchase&nbsp;cyber insurance to cover costs associated with data breaches and other types of cyberattacks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There’s been a heightened amount of interest from a lot of our clients when it comes to cyber liability,” Roque said, adding that many of his clients in the crypto sector are not covered.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWalsh said that more resources in the industry are also being invested in business continuity, disaster recovery and other resilience practices.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“As in many industries, the thinking has broadened from focusing primarily on cybersecurity and defense to include strategic focus on cyber resilience or ensuring continuity of operations even in the face of an attack,” Walsh said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to a 2020 Deloitte study, financial services spent about 10 percent of their annual IT&nbsp;budget on cybersecurity,&nbsp;with such spending amounting&nbsp;to about $2,700 per full-time employee.\n\n\n\nWalsh added that like many other sectors, the financial industry is facing a cybersecurity talent shortage. She said one way to fix the talent gap is for companies to broaden the pool of candidates they consider.&nbsp;Instead of only focusing on specific backgrounds and the number of years of experience,&nbsp;she said&nbsp;employers should also&nbsp;look into&nbsp;more diverse candidates and promising entry-level applicants.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlong with&nbsp;the financial and health&nbsp;care industries, the energy sector has also faced rising cyber threats.\n\n\n\nLast year, the Colonial Pipeline was hit by a disruptive ransomware attack forcing it to shut down operations for&nbsp;nearly a&nbsp;week. The incident caused gas shortages in several states as fuel prices spiked.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is a huge challenge worldwide,” said Suzanne Lemieux, director of operations security and emergency response at the American Petroleum Industry, referring to the rise of cyberattacks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLemieux added that the oil and gas industry has made significant investments to&nbsp;shore&nbsp;up&nbsp;its cyber defenses following the Colonial Pipeline attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInvestments were also made in education as well as cross-training cyber workers so they can learn different skill sets, allowing them to be more flexible in the type of work they do.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLemieux said cross-training also helps with retention,&nbsp;which is beneficial, especially in an industry that has a labor shortage of cyber workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“In this market today, if you’re not cyber&nbsp;secure&nbsp;you’re not going to be in the market for long,” Lemieux said.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Dodgers used seven relievers to cover seven innings on Sunday, and with off days on each of the next two Thursdays, a sixth starter isn’t really needed to give the rotation extra rest. That made Monday’s roster move most obvious, with Ryan Pepiot optioned and reliever Justin Bruihl recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City.\nPepiot had no command whatsoever on Sunday, needing 74 pitches to record only six outs. Entering after a perfect first inning by Caleb Ferguson, Pepiot walked four, threw 32 balls, and had 19 balls fouled off. He had trouble putting anyone away. Amazingly, despite the walks and three hits allowed, Pepiot only allowed one unearned run, thanks in large part to Alex Vesia stranded the two runners Pepiot left behind with nobody out in the fourth.\n\nIn eight games in the majors this season, Pepiot had a 3.78 ERA with 38 strikeouts in 33⅓ innings, but also 26 walks and a 17.4-percent walk rate.\nThis is his fifth option of the season. If he’s called up again for whatever reason, he couldn’t be sent back down without placing on waivers.\nBruihl has been up in the majors three previous stints this season, including making his first opening day roster. The left-hander has a 3.57 ERA and 4.70 FIP in 18 games with the Dodgers this year, with 11 strikeouts and four unintentional walks.\nBruihl is up more as an extra arm than any specific role, though he has extreme splits in his two major league seasons. He holds left-handers to just .187/.238/.187, having not yet allowed an extra-base hit in 82 plate appearances. But right-handers against Bruihl are hitting .275/.397/.471 in 65 PA.\nSince getting optioned on July 1, Bruihl had a 4.34 ERA with Oklahoma City, with 13 strikeouts and 12 walks in 18⅔ innings over 16 games.\nSan Francisco move\nThe Giants also made a roster move before Monday’s game, with outfielder Austin Slater landing on the 10-day injured list with a left hand sprain. Pitcher Yunior Marte was recalled from Triple-A, which means San Francisco did not have the maximum 14 pitchers on the roster before today. What a concept.",

        "description": "The Rockies&#8217; growing pains aren&#8217;t particularly pretty.\nThe announced crowd of 32,627 that turned out to watch them lose, 6-4, to Milwaukee on a scorching Monday afternoon at Coors Field can testify to that.\nThe Rockies, who arrived home after a 3-7 road trip, have lost nine of their last 12 games.\nOn Labor Day, Colorado&#8217;s lineup &#8212; one that included rookie first baseman Michael Toglia, rookie left fielder Sean Bouchard and rookie catcher Brian Serven — labored. The Rockies managed just five hits and the rookie trio combined to hit 1-for-10.\nBut it&#8217;s apparent from the lineups that manager Bud Black has been drawing up lately, and the relievers he&#8217;s been testing later in games, that school is in session as the season winds down.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s very important to be patient with these guys,&#8221; Black said. &#8220;They&#8217;re learning, each and every at-bat, each and every inning.&#8221;\nRookie right-hander Ryan Feltner, a likely part of next year&#8217;s rotation who also remains a work in progress, delivered an uneven start. Over 5 1/3 innings, he was charged with four runs on five hits with just one walk. He tied his career-high with seven strikeouts.\n&#8220;He&#8217;s learning on the fly in the big leagues, and for the most part, he&#8217;s succeeding,&#8221; Black said.\nWhen Feltner departed in the sixth inning with one out after plunking Kolton Wong, Colorado was clinging to a 3-2 lead. By the time the inning was over, Colorado trailed 6-3 after Victor Caratini blasted a three-run homer 443 feet to right off of inexperienced right-hander Justin Lawrence.\nLawrence is a reliever who the Rockies have high hopes for in 2023. But with a 4.66 ERA and a propensity to walk hitters, he&#8217;s also one of those players with a lot of unanswered questions.\n&#8220;He&#8217;s been pitching well, and you&#8217;ve noticed that we have been putting him in more important spots in the game and he&#8217;s delivered,&#8221; Black said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a guy that&#8217;s getting the ball in the strike zone much better. He&#8217;s a young pitcher still trying to figure it out at the big-league level. He&#8217;s on his way and we need to continue to see him make progress in the next month &#8212; like he has been. He can be a big part of the bullpen.&#8221;\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tKeeler: Todd Helton&#8217;s second coming?

But the Rockies woke up in the eighth, getting a solo homer to left by Cron off Taylor Rogers and loading the bases on a single by Bouchard and a walk by Hampson.\nThe sleepy crowd woke up when pinch hitter Elias Dias came to the plate to face All-Star right-hander Devin Williams, but Williams got Diaz to ground out to shortstop Willy Adames.\n\nOn Deck\nBrewers RHP Brandon Woodruff (9-4, 3.54 ERA) at Rockies RHP Chad Kuhl (6-8, 5.19)\n6:40 p.m. Tuesday, Coors Field\nTV: ATTRM\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM\nKuhl, who faced the Brewers often when he pitched for the Pirates in the National League Central, has a solid track record against them, going 4-2 with a 3.43 ERA in 12 career appearances (11 starts). Kuhl, however, didn&#8217;t pitch well at Milwaukee on July 24, lasting a season-low 2 1/3 innings in Colorado&#8217;s 10-9 loss. He allowed five runs (three earned) on five hits with two walks and four strikeouts. The right-hander is making his third start since returning from the injured list, going 0-1 with a 5.59 ERA in his first two starts back.\nWoodruff, who&#8217;ll face the Rockies for the second time this season, is coming off a tough start at Arizona. He gave up five runs on eight hits in 5 2/3 innings. Since coming off the injured list, he is 4-1 with a 2.80 ERA in 12 starts. He&#8217;s 1-1 with a 6.75 ERA in four career starts against the Rockies, including a win on July 23 at Milwaukee when he gave up just one run on four hits over six innings and fanned eight.\nTrending: Charlie Blackmon recorded two of the Rockies’ hits five hits Monday and drove in two runs with a single in the first inning. He&#8217;s hit safely in 30 of his last 32 home games since June 5, slashing .358/.390/.584 with 28 RBIs over that span.\nAt issue: After hitting just 1-for-11 on the Rockies&#8217; just-completed road trip, rookie catcher Brian Serven went 0-for-3 on Monday.\nPitching probables:\nWednesday: LHP Eric Lauer (10-6, 3.54) at Rockies LHP Kyle Freeland (7-9, 4.75), 1:10 p.m., ATTRM\nThursday: Off day",

But it turned out that our walks were less brisk than usual, because everywhere we went were hedgerows bursting with ripe blackberries. It was easily the best crop I can remember — which seems strange, given that we’re in a long period of drought.\n\nQuote of the Day\n\n”Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the earth&#8217;s surface relatively to other such matter; second, telling other people to do so. The first one is unpleasant and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid.”\n\n\nBertrand Russell\n\nI quote this all the time when people complain of being overworked.

He had produced hundreds of thousands of words, then hundreds of thousands more, updating the text as academic economics and the world itself changed. He kept writing, for years, for decades, for so long that he ended up writing for roughly 5 percent of the time capitalism itself has existed. The problem wasn’t figuring out how the story started. The problem was knowing when it ended.\n\nDeLong says that he originally thought the story would end in 1999 with the realisation of Fukuyama’s ‘end of history’ vision.\nBut in time he concluded that\n\nneoliberalism and social democracy would not be gently taking turns. In political terms, the future instead would be about the “return of something that Madeleine Albright called fascism, and who am I to tell her not to,” he said. And in economic terms, it would be about high inequality, low productivity, and slow growth. “We may have solved the problem of production,” DeLong told me. “We certainly have not solved the problem of distribution, or of utilizing our extraordinary, immense wealth to make us happy and good people.”\n\nMany of us have been waiting for this book for a long time.\n\nMy commonplace booklet\n”Ladies in shorts\nand gentlemen with naked torsos\nare invited to forbid themselves\nto enter the church.\n\nChurch Notice, French Pyrenees.\n\n(From French Widow in Every Room)\n\nThis Blog is also available as a daily email.

        "description": "A few players recently designated for assignment have gone unclaimed on outright waivers:\n\nThe Yankees announced Monday afternoon that southpaw Anthony Banda has been sent outright to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Signed to a major league contract on August 28, Banda spent only seven days on the MLB roster before being designated for assignment. Banda pitched twice as a Yankee, allowing eight of the ten batters he faced to reach base (five walks, a hit batman and two hits). That disappointing showing brought his overall season line up to a 6.75 ERA with slightly worse than average strikeout and walk rates (22.2% and 9.6%, respectively) through 26 2/3 innings split between the Pirates, Blue Jays and Yanks. Having previously been outrighted in his career, Banda will have the right to refuse the assignment in favor of minor league free agency.\nMets right-hander Connor Grey was outrighted to Triple-A Syracuse, according to his transactions log at MLB.com. A seven-year minor league veteran, Grey received his first big league call on August 22. Unfortunately, he didn&#8217;t appear in a game before he was optioned out. Now that he&#8217;s passed through waivers, he&#8217;ll have to work his way back onto a 40-man roster if he&#8217;s to make his MLB debut. Grey has made 22 appearances (21 starts) with Syracuse this season, pitching to a 5.52 ERA over 93 innings. He&#8217;s posted subpar strikeout and walk numbers but generated grounders on nearly half the batted balls he&#8217;s allowed. Grey will remain in the organization but would reach minor league free agency this winter if the Mets don&#8217;t add him back onto the 40-man roster.\nMarlins southpaw Jake Fishman has gone unclaimed on waivers, according to his transactions tracker at MLB.com. The 27-year-old has earned a pair of big league calls this season, but he&#8217;s only been on the roster briefly. Fishman did make his first two big league outings, tallying 4 1/3 innings of one-run ball. He&#8217;s spent the majority of the season working as a long reliever with Triple-A Jacksonville, pitching to an excellent 2.04 ERA over 53 innings. He&#8217;s induced grounders on a strong 52.6% of batted balls with a solid 23.9% strikeout rate. Fishman has now been outrighted twice this year by the Marlins, giving him the opportunity to refuse this assignment in favor of free agency.",

        "description": "Photo by Greg Fiume/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Braves are headed west for a three-city, eight-game trip that begins with a two-game series in Oakland Riding a five-game winning streak, the Atlanta Braves will head out for an eight-game road trip that will begin Tuesday with a two-game stop in Oakland against the Athletics. Atlanta’s recent surge has them just one game back in the NL East standings behind the New York Mets. Since starting the season 23-27, the Braves have gone 61-24. They are 37-26 on the road this season and swept a two-game series against Oakland at home back in June. \nRookie outfielder Michael Harris II has been red-hot for Atlanta and is currently riding a 12-game hitting streak. He is hitting .340/.392/.589 with 14 doubles and seven home runs in the “second half,” i.e., since the All-Star Break. Austin Riley has homered in four of his last five games and had a seven-game hitting streak snapped Sunday against the Marlins. \nThe series will also mark the return of Matt Olson to Oakland for the first time since the offseason trade that sent him to Atlanta. Olson spent the first six seasons of his major league career with the Athletics. The Braves will also see two of the prospects that they sent away to get Olson in this series. Shea Langeliers made his major league debut in mid-August and is hitting .221/.229/.456 with three home runs in 17 games. Cristian Pache also returned to the major league roster in late August, but is hitting just .160/.214/.233 in 222 plate appearances this season.  \nOverall, the Athletics do not pose much of a threat on paper. They haven’t won a series since mid-August and are 11-20 in their last 31 games. They don’t hit well (85 wRC+, third-worst in MLB) nor pitch well (second-worst team pitching fWAR). Really their only useful roster function is above-average defense.\nSean Murphy has been awesome this season on both sides of the ball, compiling 4.4 fWAR while notably underhitting his xwOBA. That’s really about all there is to say for Oakland’s position player corps — for example, Elvis Andrus is second on their team in xwOBA and was released anyway. A lot of the rest of the roster is composed of a mishmash of guys who can hit but not field, or field but not hit — they’ve used 29 different position players this year, and only 11 have 0.1 fWAR or more. \nThe pitching end has been similarly grim. Frankie Montas was great but got dealt. Cole Irvin and Paul Blackburn have been okay. Zach Jackson and A.J. Puk have had nice relief seasons, but Jackson is riding a massive FIP-xFIP gap to success so far. The Athletics have given a ton of playing time to a bunch of pitchers that have seriously struggled — 30 percent of the team’s innings have been thrown by sub-replacement level pitchers so far. \nTuesday, September 6, 9:40 p.m. ET (Bally Sports South)\nKyle Wright (25 GS, 154.2 IP, 24.0 K%, 6.9 BB%, 2.85 ERA, 3.50 FIP)\nKyle Wright will get the start for Atlanta on Tuesday night to begin the road trip. Wright has pitched well of late and hasn’t allowed a run in two straight starts. He blanked the Rockies for seven innings while allowing five hits and two walks to go along with six strikeouts. He’s allowed two runs or fewer in seven of his last eight outings, including each of his last four, where he’s been dominant. Wright faced Oakland in Atlanta back on June 7 and allowed five hits, two runs and struck out seven in eight innings. \nCole Irvin (24 GS, 147.2 IP, 17.6 K%, 4.6 BB%, 3.35 ERA, 3.93 FIP)\nLefty Cole Irvin will get the start for the Athletics in the series opener. Irvin matched up against Wright back on June 7 and allowed seven hits and two runs, both home runs by Acuña Jr., in 5 1/3 innings. Irvin is coming off of a tough outing where he allowed nine hits and five runs in 5 1/3 innings against the Nationals. While Irvin seems like your generic soft-tossing innings-eater, his recent results have been whiplash-inducing. He’s been hammered in three of his last four outings, but the other was an amazing 11-strikeout, zero-walk, seven-shutout-inning performance against the Marlins. He’s had other good starts against teams like the Angels and Rangers since the All-Star Break, but tends to get hit hard by offenses like the Astros, and hopefully, the Braves. \nIf you’re watching, take a gander at Irvin’s slow curve, which has one of the least consistent shapes and velocities of any pitch you’ll see this season. That doesn’t help it work particularly well, it’s just a weird thing to see in a baseball game.\nWednesday, September 7, 3:37 p.m. ET (Bally Sports South)\nSpencer Strider (28 G, 17 GS, 114.2 IP, 38.1 K%, 8.3 BB%, 2.67 ERA, 1.84 FIP)\nSpencer Strider will get the start in Wednesday’s series finale. Strider is coming off of (in)arguably his best start as a professional, where he broke John Smoltz’s Atlanta record for strikeouts in a game with 16 in a two-hit, eight inning performance against the Rockies. Strider has been light- out of late and has currently quieted concerns that he might wear down as the season enters its final month. He has allowed a total of three runs in his last four starts (25 innings) and has 36 strikeouts and seven walks during that span. \nKen Waldichuk (1 GS, 4.2 IP, 26.1 K%, 17.4 BB%, 1.93 ERA, 3.12 FIP)\nYoung left-hander Ken Waldichuk will get the start for Oakland in the finale. The Athletics acquired Waldichuk at the deadline from the Yankees in the Frankie Montas trade. He allowed five hits and one run, but also walked four in a 4 2/3 innings in his debut against the Nationals on September 1. Like many young call-ups, Waldichuk has good “stuff” and movement but really suspect command.",

The Colorado Rockies started off today’s game with a hot first inning, and despite the hot afternoon, cooled off significantly for the remainder of the game. One might even say their bats were ice cold.\nThe Rockies just couldn’t find enough offense\nThe Rockies came in and made a splash early. After a McMahon hit, a walk and a fielders choice, Charlie Blackmon had a two-RBI single that gave the Rockies an early lead. Garrett Hampson was also able to get CJ Cron home on a sacrifice the give the Rockies a 3-0 lead. \nCJ Cron homered in the eighth inning and even though they loaded up the bases directly following his solo shot, the Rockies were unable to score any more runs. \nThe Brewers found a way\nIn the fourth inning the Brewers were able to come within one, even with two outs. Andrew McCutchen singled to bring home Rowdy Tellez follow by a double by Jace Peterson to plate McCutchen. \nThings didn’t completely fall apart until the sixth inning, though. Ryan Feltner started out the inning but was replaced by Justin Lawrence after a single from Tellez and hitting Kolton Wong with a pitch. A Jace Peterson single tied up the game. \nThe real pain came on a Victor Caratini home run into the bullpen, giving the Brewers a three-run lead making the score 6-3. \nThe fun, though\nMichael Toglia made his big-league Coors Field debut today (I have to specify because he did play here in the 2021 Futures Game) and had a dazzling catch at first base.\n\n\nMichael Toglia with the quick reflexes! pic.twitter.com/rPko9sSldO— RoxGifsVids (@RoxGifsVids) September 5, 2022",

        "description": "President Biden visited two key swing states on Labor Day to tout Democratic accomplishments and go on offense against Republicans with the midterm elections just two months away.\n\n\n\nBiden first made a stop in Wisconsin to speak at Milwaukee Laborfest, followed by a stop in Pittsburgh where he delivered remarks to the United Steelworkers of America Local Union 2227. \n\n\n\nWhile Biden used both events to demonstrate his support for labor unions, he also used the trips as campaign stops to show what his administration and the Democratic-controlled Congress has accomplished while he’s been in office.\n\n\n\nThe “...American Rescue Plan also created and saved millions of jobs. Why? Because here in the state of Pennsylvania, and almost every state, didn't have enough money to keep teachers on the payroll, to keep firefighters on the job, to keep police on the job, to keep people, nurses and docs on the job,” Biden said while in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“And so what’d we do? We, in fact, gave them the money to make sure they did it. And this governor, your governor, spent it well.”\n\n\n\nHe also touted the bipartisan infrastructure law; aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act, including an aspect of the law that allows some drug prices to be negotiated by Medicare; and legislation boosting the domestic semiconductor industry amid a critical computer chip shortage.\n\n\n\nBiden used the opportunity to go on offensive against Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), one of the most vulnerable GOP senators up for reelection in November, blasting him for comments that he thought Medicare and Social Security should be annually approved.\n\n\n\nWhile in Pennsylvania, the president didn’t invoke Republican Senate nominee Mehmet Oz's name but instead went after former President Trump more prominently in his remarks.\n\n\n\n“All of us love the country. But you can't love the country and say how much you love it when you only accept one of two outcomes from the election. Either you won or you were cheated. It doesn't work that way,” Biden said, referring to Trump’s baseless allegations that the last election was stolen from him.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd borrowing language he used during his prime-time speech last Thursday, he also went after \"MAGA Republicans.\"\n\n\n\n“Not every Republican is a MAGA Republican. Not every Republican embraces that extreme ideology. I know because I've been able to work with mainstream Republicans my whole career. But the extreme MAGA Republicans in Congress have chosen to go backwards, full of anger, violence, hate and division,\" Biden said in Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nWhile Democratic Senate challenger Mandela Barnes, who is taking on Johnson in November, was not president during Biden's speech, Biden gave him a shout out during his remarks in Wisconsin. \n\n\n\nPennsylvania Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman did attend the president’s event in the state. Biden quipped during his speech, “if I have to be in a foxhole. I want John Fetterman in there with me.”\n\n\n\nBoth Fetterman and Barnes are gearing up for tight races in critical battleground states that will help determine whether Democrats can retain control of the Senate past November. \n\n\n\nThe nonpartisan election handicapper Cook Political Report rates Johnson’s seat as a “toss up” while it recently moved Pennsylvania’s open Senate seat from a “toss up” to “lean Democrat.”",

        "description": "Brent Skeen-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  An impromptu bullpen game was not a recipe for success as the Orioles lost to the Blue Jays for the second time in a single day. An awful day of baseball at Camden Yards came to a merciful close on Monday night as the Orioles lost 8-4 to the visiting Blue Jays, suffering a sweep at the hands of the team directly in front of them in the playoff race.\nFollowing a 7-3 loss in the first game of the day, things went from bad to worse for the Orioles when it was revealed that projected starter Jordan Lyles would not be able to take his turn in the rotation for game two. Lyles attempted to warmup, but couldn’t continue, citing an illness as the cause.\nAs a result, the Orioles made a move in-between games, promoting Bruce Zimmerman for needed length out of the bullpen. Beau Sulser, who had just been called up earlier in the day, was optioned to make room.\nKeegan Akin made the spot start, and things went well...for a little bit. The lefty worked two scoreless innings, striking out four in the process and allowing just one runner, a Teoscar Hernandez double. \nIn the meantime, the Orioles took the lead. The much-maligned Rougned Odor crushed a no-doubt dong to deep right field. It was the second baseman’s 12th homer of the season, and it represented some of the only good news for the home team in this one.\nThings got wobbly in the third for Akin. A double from Jackie Bradley Jr. and then a walk for George Springer was enough to get him the boot in favor of Nick Vespi.\nVespi’s appearance was noteworthy because it meant the southpaw would pitch on three straight days, something no other Orioles pitcher has done this season. It was a tactic employed by manager Brandon Hyde to keep his relievers as fresh as possible, and he would have looked like a genius if the first time he pulled it off was a success. But it wasn’t. Vespi served up a three-run homer to Bo Bichette to give the Blue Jays a 3-1 lead.\nAfter that, Hyde turned to the recently promoted Zimmermann. The hope was that he could both provide innings and regain the form he had at the start of the season. Welp, at least he accomplished the former.\nThe Baltimore-born hurler got through the fourth and fifth innings unscathed, but then he started to give up home runs. Bichette led off the sixth with his second home run of the day. Cavan Biggio followed with another dong in the same frame. Zimmerman was left in to take this one on the chin. Three consecutive hits from Raimel Tapia, Danny Jansen, and Bradley Jr. scored two more runs.\nBichette was back to continue contributing to Zimmermann’s nightmarish outing in the seventh inning. The shortstop launched his third long ball of the day, a shot to centerfield, to put the Blue Jays up 8-1.\nThe sluggish Orioles offense mounted somewhat of a comeback attempt in the bottom of the seventh inning. An Odor walk, a Kyle Stowers single, and a Robinson Chirinos base hit loaded the bases with no outs. A catcher’s interference with Cedric Mullins at the plate kept the bases loaded and scored Odor. Adley Rutschman added to the lead with an RBI fielder’s choice, scoring Stowers. The promise of a big inning was still in the air, but it would not come to fruition as Anthony Santander and Ryan Mountcastle were both retired to halt the threat.\nThere was one last bit of offense in store. Rutschman launched his 10th home run of the season in the bottom of the ninth inning. But that was the extent of it as the O’s fell 8-4.\nIt should be noted that Zimmermann came back out to the mound for the top of the ninth, and he was able to toss one more zero to finish up his day after six innings of relief. The stat line is not pretty, and even the six innings feel empty when the Orioles really needed quality and quantity on this day. But considering the hand he was dealt, Zimmermann’s effort is at least appreciated. \nBut to say that today was a disappointment is an understatement. The Orioles didn’t need to emerge with wins in both games of the doubleheader, although it would have been nice. But they did need to avoid being swept themselves. They were unable to accomplish that.\nThe math starts to get tough for the Orioles. They will now sit 4.5 games back of these Blue Jays for the final AL wild card spot. It’s not an impossible mountain to climb, and considering they still have eight games against the Jays, including the final two games of this series, you could say they hold their own destiny in their hands. At the same time, it is a tall task with a remaining schedule that feels a lot shorter than it did just a few hours ago.\nA win on Tuesday now feels like a requirement. The O’s will turn to a hot hand in rookie Kyle Bradish. He faces off against Mitch White, a trade deadline acquisition from the Dodgers. First pitch is set for 7:05 from Camden Yards.",

        "description": "In a recent survey, young adults 19-30 years old reported significantly more marijuana and hallucinogen use in 2021 compared to five and 10 years ago, survey results show.\nRates of past-month nicotine vaping, which have been gradually increasing in young adults for the past four years, also continued their general upward trend in 2021, despite leveling off in 2020. Past-month marijuana vaping, which had significantly decreased in 2020, rebounded to pre-pandemic levels in 2021.\nAlcohol remains the most used substance among adults in the study, though past-year, past-month, and daily drinking have been decreasing over the past decade. Binge drinking (five or more drinks in a row in the past two weeks) rebounded in 2021 from a historic low in 2020, during the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn the other hand, high-intensity drinking (having 10 or more drinks in a row in the past two weeks) has been steadily increasing over the past decade and in 2021 reached its highest level ever recorded since first measured in 2005.\n&#8220;One of the best ways we can learn more about drug use and its impact on people is to observe which drugs are appearing, in which populations, for how long, and under which contexts,&#8221; says Megan Patrick, a research professor at the University of Michigan&#8217;s Institute for Social Research and principal investigator of the Monitoring the Future study.\n&#8220;Monitoring the Future and similar large-scale surveys on a consistent sample population allow us to assess the effects of &#8216;natural experiments&#8217; like the pandemic. We can examine how and why drugs are used and highlight critical areas to guide where the research should go next and to inform public health interventions.&#8221;\nSince 1975, the Monitoring the Future study has annually surveyed substance use behaviors and attitudes among a nationally representative sample of teens. A longitudinal panel study component of MTF conducts follow-up surveys on a subset of these participants to track their drug use through adulthood. Participants self-report their drug use behaviors across three primary time periods—lifetime, past year (12 months) and past month (30 days).\nResearchers collected data for the 2021 survey online from April to October 2021. Key findings in the young adult group include:\n\nMarijuana use: Past-year, past-month, and daily marijuana use (use on 20 or more occasions in the past 30 days) reached the highest levels ever recorded since these trends were first monitored in 1988. Marijuana use in the past month was reported by 29% of young adults in 2021, compared to 21% five years ago (2016) and 17% 10 years ago (2011). Daily marijuana use also significantly increased during these time periods, reported by 11% of young adults in 2021, a significant increase from 8% in 2016 and 6% in 2011.\nHallucinogen use: Past-year hallucinogen use had been relatively stable over the past few decades until 2020, when reports of use started to increase dramatically. In 2021, 8% of young adults reported past-year hallucinogen use, representing an all-time high since the category was first surveyed in 1988. By comparison, in 2016, 5% of young adults reported past-year hallucinogen use, and in 2011, only 3% reported use. Types of hallucinogens reported by participants included LSD, MDMA, mescaline, peyote, &#8220;shrooms&#8221; or psilocybin, and PCP. The only hallucinogen measured that significantly decreased in use was MDMA (also called ecstasy or molly), showing statistically significant decreases within one year as well as the past five years—from 5% in both 2016 and 2020 to 3% in 2021.\nVaping: Nicotine vaping in the past month increased significantly among young adults in 2021, despite leveling off in 2020 during the earlier part of the pandemic. The continued increase in 2021 reflects a general long-term upward trend: In 2021, nicotine vaping prevalence nearly tripled to 16%, compared to 6% in 2017 when the behavior was first recorded. Prevalence of marijuana vaping in the past month among young adults significantly dipped in 2020 but returned to near pre-pandemic levels in 2021. Since 2017, when marijuana vaping was included in the study, past-month prevalence has doubled—from 6% in 2017 to 12% in 2021.\nAlcohol use: Reports of binge drinking by young adults—defined as having five or more drinks in a row in the past two weeks—returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2021 after significantly decreasing in 2020 (32% reported in 2021 vs. 28% in 2020 and 32% in 2019). High-intensity drinking, defined as having 10 or more drinks in a row in the past two weeks, was at its highest level since it was first measured in 2005, reported by 13% of young adults in 2021, compared with 11% in 2005. However, past-month and past-year alcohol use and daily drinking have been on a downward trend in young adults for the past 10 years. For example, in 2021, 66% of young adults reported alcohol use in the past 30 days, a significant decline from 70% recorded in 2016 and 69% in 2011.\n\nThe survey also shows significant decreases in past-month cigarette smoking by young adults and non-medical use of opioid medications in the past year (surveyed as &#8220;narcotics other than heroin&#8221;) compared to 10 years ago. Both substances have been declining steadily in use for the past decade.\n&#8220;Medical and recreational cannabis laws (37 and 19 states, respectively) have increased availability and lowered or removed legal consequences for cannabis use. This legal change has been accompanied by shifting opinions, with many people believing that cannabis is generally quite safe,&#8221; says Kevin Boehnke, a research investigator with Michigan Medicine’s anesthesiology department and the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center.\nBoehnke, who studies trends in use of cannabis and psychedelics for pain and other physical and mental health conditions, wasn&#8217;t involved in this study.\nHe notes that, from a safety standpoint, it is well documented that cannabis has a lower risk of lethal overdose than alcohol and nearly all other drugs, making it an attractive alternative to other drugs in recreational or medical settings.\n&#8220;Lastly, I think there is growing awareness, including and especially among young people, of the morally bankruptcy and scientific invalidity of War on Drugs policies, increasing skepticism of harms attributed to cannabis.&#8221;\nAs far as psychedelic drugs are concerned, &#8220;there are quite a few overlaps and similarities, especially related to the War on Drugs policies. The State of Oregon and several municipalities have also decriminalized psychedelics, following in the steps of cannabis in setting a precedent for decriminalization of Schedule I drugs. This may have increased accessibility as well,&#8221; he says.\n&#8220;The enormous burden of mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, and the inadequacy of current treatment options have also led to a lot of excitement about psychedelics as a medical treatment.&#8221;\nAs use of these other compounds grow, it&#8217;s possible that some people are using cannabis or psychedelics rather than alcohol, Boehnke notes. &#8220;However, while past-year, past-month, and daily drinking is slowly declining based on these data, the increase in high-intensity drinking is certainly concerning.&#8221;\nSource: University of Michigan\nThe post Young people report using more marijuana, hallucinogens appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Set Number: X163621 TK1\n    \n\n  A Cubs trade deadline acquisition will soon make his MLB debut. None of this has officially been announced by the Cubs as of today, but the following transactions appeared on the Cubs website late Monday:\n\nThe Cubs placed Justin Steele on the 15-day injured list retroactive to September 2. He left his last start, August 26 in Milwaukee, with back issues.\nTo replace Steele on the 28-man active roster, righthander Hayden Wesneski was added from Triple-A Iowa.\nTo make room for Wesneski on the 40-man roster, righthander Kervin Castro was designated for assignment.\n\nWesneski was acquired from the Yankees August 1 in a trade for reliever Scott Effross. The 24-year-old Wesneski, who was the Yankees’ sixth-round pick in 2019 out of Sam Houston State, has made five appearances (four starts) for Iowa with a 5.66 ERA and 1.210 WHIP. That doesn’t sound great, but that’s two bad outings and the last three have been really good: 0.60 ERA, 0.600 WHIP, .087 opponents BA, 15 strikeouts in 15 innings.\nSteele’s placement on the IL retroactive to last Friday means he won’t be eligible to return until September 17, and having thrown 119 innings this year — a career high — it might just be best to shut him down for the rest of the year.\nKervin Castro had talent and had some good outings for the Giants last year, but the results just weren’t there in eight appearances for the Cubs in which he posted a 7.59 ERA and 1.500 WHIP. I assume if he clears waivers he’ll be sent back outright to Iowa.\nI’m not quite sure what the Cubs intend to do with Wesneski. He could be slotted in to start, but the starters for the Reds series (Wade Miley, Javier Assad, Adrian Sampson) were noted in this tweet Sunday:\n\n\nCubs rotation for Cincinnati: Miley (off IL), Assad, Sampson. Giving Steele extra time with his back.— Steve Greenberg (@SLGreenberg) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nSubject to change, of course. Wesneski could piggyback with Miley, I suppose, or that list could change before the Reds series begins.\n “As always, we await developments.”",

Our hearts go out to the families, loved ones and friends of those who remain missing and the deceased,” it added in a separate tweet.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Coast Guard’s Sunday news release, the float plane was heading to the Renton Municipal Airport, located about 12 miles southeast of Seattle.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCrews immediately recovered one body, with another nine missing.

        "description": "The Padres placed infielder Brandon Drury on the seven-day concussion injured list, retroactive to September 3, prior to today&#8217;s matchup with the Diamondbacks. Catcher Jorge Alfaro has been activated from the 10-day IL to take the vacated active roster spot. Drury was hit in the head by a Dustin May curveball on Friday. He remained on the active roster over the weekend but hasn&#8217;t played since then, and he&#8217;s apparently still battling concussion-like symptoms. The 30-year-old is eligible to return as soon as Saturday, although his specific recovery timetable is unclear.\nAcquired as part of San Diego&#8217;s massive trade deadline, Drury has struggled through his first month in Southern California. While he&#8217;s connected on five home runs as a Padre (including a grand slam in his first at-bat), he&#8217;s hitting only .220 with a .262 on-base percentage over 107 plate appearances since the trade. That&#8217;s a notable dip from the excellent .274/.335/.520 line he posted through the first four months of the year as a member of the Reds. Despite the drop in production, Drury has remained an everyday player for a Friars team battling for a Wild Card spot. The season&#8217;s final month is also important for him personally, as he&#8217;s slated to hit the open market at the end of the year.\nLet&#8217;s check in on a couple other injury situations within the division:\n\nThe Giants placed outfielder Austin Slater on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to yesterday, with a left hand sprain. Reliever Yunior Marte is up from Triple-A Sacramento to take the roster spot. Part of a matchup-heavy outfield in San Francisco, Slater has emerged as a highly productive role player when in the lineup for manager Gabe Kapler. He&#8217;s hitting .267/.378/.396 over 286 plate appearances this season, his third straight above-average campaign. The righty-hitting Slater carries a .257/.357/.424 line dating back to the start of 2020, including a massive .284/.389/.497 showing against left-handed pitching. Luis González has been in the lineup each of the past four days as Slater has nursed the injury that&#8217;ll now send him to the IL.\nRockies reliever Lucas Gilbreath is being shut down for the season, reports Danielle Allentuck of the Colorado Springs Gazette (Twitter link). The left-hander is on the injured list with a flexor strain in his throwing elbow, and he&#8217;s headed for a platelet-rich plasma injection. Allentuck adds that Gilbreath&#8217;s offseason work will be delayed by the issue, but the expectation is that he&#8217;ll avoid surgery and should be ready for Spring Training. Gilbreath has been a trusted relief option for skipper Bud Black this year, getting into 47 games and working 43 innings. He posted a 4.19 ERA with above-average strikeout (26.2%) and ground-ball (46.7%) marks, but he battled some control inconsistency.",

        "description": "Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Merely the best pitching debut in franchise history.  Record: 65-69. Pace: 79-83. Change on 2021: +20. \nThere were no half-Nelsons to be found at Petco Park this afternoon, only the full variety. Ryne Nelson made his major-league debut, and it was one for the record books. He kept a tough Padres’ offense entirely in check, throwing seven scoreless inning to pick up a thoroughly well-deserved win. Stone Garrett homered and Christian Walker drove in a pair of runs, as Arizona improved to 9-2 over their last 11 games, and got a good jump on their attempt to win a fourth consecutive series. \nThe D-backs offense had an odd start. Lead-off man Carson Kelly walked and Josh Rojas worked the count full. He then struck out - as did our next four batters, Blake Snell delivering a harsh diet of sliders. It took seven Diamondbacks before anyone put a ball in play, Garrett doubling to right with two outs in the second. Alek Thomas followed with a double of his own to the left-center gap, and Arizona had an unexpected 1-0 lead, after five consecutive K's. In defense of the hitters, it can't have been easy for either offense in the early innings. The 3:40 pm start time left awkward shadows crossing the infield between the mound and home-plate. [The Petco lights came on before the fifth inning, even though it wasn't even 5 pm yet]\nMajor-league debutant Nelson was just as able to take advantage of that too. Though he was also heating up the radar gun, touching 98 mph, a good four or five mph harder than the figures we had expected to see. Was it the adrenaline of his debut, in front of 75+ family and friends at Petco? Regardless, after giving up a double to the first batter he faced, Nelson settled down admirably. He stranded that base-runner and retired San Diego in order for the second, third, fourth AND fifth innings, quickly and efficiently. He needed only 55 pitches to get to that point, striking out five, with his change-up looked particularly pretty, playing well off that 97 mph fastball. \nHowever, the D-backs were struggling almost as much. After Thomas, Jake McCarthy became Arizona’s next base-runner, when he singled with two outs in the fourth, and stole second, his 13th of the season. He was stranded there though, as Garrett became Snell's eighth strikeout victim through four innings. Josh Rojas singled leading off the fifth, but Ketel Marte's wretched spell continued. He had struck out on three swinging strikes in the first, an AB Michael said was Marte's worst of the season, and emptied the bases with a double-play. Christian Walker followed with his third K of the game, allowing Snell to reach double digits; Emmanuel Rivera was also 0-for-3 with three strikeouts off Snell. \n\nMeanwhile Nelson kept motoring, throwing strikes and keeping the ball down in the zone. He retired 17 batters in a row following the opening double, before the same batter, Jurickson Profar, doubled again, this time past a diving Walker. The runner took third as McCarthy booted the ball around in the corner. Fortunately, there were two outs and Juan Soto's fly-ball to center ended the sixth, with the D-backs still clinging to their 1-0 advantage. They were able to double that courtesy of Garrett's third home-run (above). While Nelson will, justifiably, get the lion's share of the plaudits for today's game, it's worth looking at what Stone has done to start his major-league career. \nHe has 14 hits through his first ten games in the majors, a number in franchise which trails only Mark Reynolds, who had 17. Garrett's triple-slash is .424/.424/.818 for a 1.242 OPS. The only higher OPSs through that point with a meaningful number of PAs were by Junior Spivey (1.290), Reynolds (1.380) and Carlos Quentin (1.554). Now, that's not going to sustain for ever, and the complete lack of any bases on balls (36 PA so far) is going to become an issue. But he wasn't even ranked as a top 30 prospect by just about anyone. Remember, he had all but given up on baseball in favor of real estate. Whatever may happen the rest of the way, it's one of the best stories of the season. \nBack on the mound, despite a manageable pitch count, Ryne did seem to be running out of gas somewhat in the seventh. This perhaps gives credence to the adrenaline theory for his increased velocity earlier. The pitches that were painting the black were now missing the zone by some margin. The pitches in the zone were less competitive, and the Padres put the tying run on base with two outs, courtesy of a pair of singles. With his 87th and final pitch, Nelson coaxed a fly-ball to right, stranding the runners. The final line: seven innings pitched, no runs allowed on four hits and no walks, with seven strikeouts. \n\nOnly one other pitcher since 1901 has made a debut of 7+ scoreless innings, with at least seven Ks and no bases on balls [Nick Kingham for the Pirates in 2018] In terms of D-backs' debuts, the previous high Game Score was 72 by Archie Bradley in 2015 and Geraldo Guzman in 2000. Nelson today was a 76, if my math is correct, which would be tied for 12th-best start from any Arizona pitcher this season. Fun fact: it’s a higher Game Score than our $23 million man Madison Bumgarner has managed in any outing this year. \nThough at 2-0, the game was not out of the woods yet. Walker took a large step towards solidifying that in the top of the eighth, singling home a pair of runs, after a Geraldo Perdomo double was followed by a Josh Rojas walk and stolen-base. Thomas delivered tacos in the ninth with his second RBI, scoring McCarthy with a ninth-inning sacrifice fly. Meanwhile, Kevin Ginkel pitched a 1-2-3 eighth in relief of Nelson, and for the second day in a row, Arizona had a chance at a 5-0 shutout. Unlike yesterday, Caleb Smith would not Melancon the shutout, giving us another perfect inning and closing out Arizona’s first shutout victory in San Diego since September 20th, 2019. \n  \n        \n  \n\nClick for details at Fangraphs.com\nTsar Peter the Great: Ryne Nelson, +45.3%\nRah, rah, Rasputin: Stone Garrett, +13.0%\nTsar Nicholas II: Ketel Marte, -13.0%\n\n\nAlmost three hundred comments on the Gameday Thread, and no wonder, with one of the most memorable debuts in franchise history. Comment of the thread to kilnborn for a statistical nugget to keep an eye on:\n  \n        \n  \nOnly another five or so scoreless starts to go, Ryne! Perhaps more achievable might be the number of scoreless innings to start a career as a Diamondback. On a quick and dirty check, that seems to be 12.2, held jointly by James (the artist formerly known as Jimmie) Sherfy and Clay Zavada. \nSame two teams tomorrow, with a more conventional start time of 6:40 pm. Merrill Kelly takes the mound for Arizona, in what should be another good pitching duel, going up against Joe Musgrove. I’ll be back on the recap pony for that one, but after this game, I can’t say I mind too much. Do not make a fool out of this contentment, Diamondbacks...",

        "description": "Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Crew scores four in big sixth inning in comeback victory Box Score\nMilwaukee managed to take the series opener against the Rockies on the road Monday afternoon, winning 6-4 in comeback fashion after a go-ahead three-run homer by Victor Caratini.\nColorado jumped out to a quick lead in the first, as Ryan McMahon, Brendan Rodgers and C.J. Cron reached via a single, a walk and an error, respectively, to load the bases with no outs. Charlie Blackmon followed it up with a two-run single to make it 2-0. Garrett Hampson added to the lead later in the inning on a sac fly, putting the Rockies up 3-0 after one.\nAfter the rough first inning, Adrian Houser settled down, lasting five innings and giving up just the three runs (one earned) on two hits and two walks with two strikeouts.\nThe Brewers finally answered back in the top of the fourth, as Rowdy Tellez started the inning with a double before back-to-back outs put Milwaukee in danger of spoiling a runner in scoring position. Andrew McCutchen made sure that didn’t happen though, singling to drive in Tellez. Jace Peterson then drove in McCutchen on a double to make it 3-2.\nTellez kicked off another rally in the sixth inning with a single, which was followed by a Kolten Wong hit by pitch and a McCutchen single to load the bases with one out. Peterson then hit a sac fly and Victor Caratini put the Crew ahead for good on a three-run bomb with two outs.\nCron hit a solo homer in the bottom of the eighth off Taylor Rogers to make it 6-4, but that was all the offense either team would muster in the hitter-friendly Coors Field. McCutchen, Caratini and Tellez all had two-hit days for Milwaukee.\nMilwaukee’s bullpen of Brad Boxberger, Matt Bush, Rogers and Devin Williams combined for four innings, allowing just one run on three hits and two walks with four strikeouts to hold off Colorado’s offense.\nThe Brewers will look to take game two on Tuesday evening at 7:40 p.m. They’ll send Brandon Woodruff to the mound to take on Chad Kuhl for Colorado.",

        "description": "Erik Williams-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Martin Maldonado gets the only RBI plus a key assist to put the Astros’ rookie on the record for his first MLB win. \nIt’s an embarrassment of riches. \nIt’s not like the Astros don’t already have six starters that just about any other MLB team would drool over. The Astros’ starting pitcher team ERA is the best in the AL at 3.04 while employing six different starters almost all year.\nAnd now here comes Hunter Brown. In his first MLB appearance, the just-turned 24-year-old rookie threw a three-hit, six-inning shutout, showing remarkable poise and surprising control.\nBrown’s MLB career started auspiciously.  In the first inning, he began his career striking out superstars Marcus Semien and Corey Seager, his first two batters faced.\nBrown retired his first eight batters, striking out four until Brown finally gave up the first hit in his career to Bubba Thompson. Thompson was later thrown out by Martin Maldonado trying to steal second for the third out in inning three.\n\n\nRunning on Machete? Bold. pic.twitter.com/yjBkGley4c— Houston Astros (@astros) September 5, 2022\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Astros took an early 1-0 lead in the second inning on an RBI single by Martin Maldonado, scoring Trey Mancini.\n\n\nEarly lead for the Stros   pic.twitter.com/TqAAwMgTFT— Houston Astros (@astros) September 5, 2022\n\n\n\nBrown escaped trouble in the fourth and fifth innings unscathed. In the fourth, Semien opened with a hard-hit double to left-center field and moved to third on a Corey Seager groundout. Nathaniel Lowe next crushed a 95 MPH grounder that was adeptly handled by Yuli Gurriel playing in that kept Semien on third. Adolis Garcia ended the inning with a 107.5 MPH grounder to Alex Bregman.\nIn the fifth inning, Brown got the first two outs on grounders but walked Kole Calhoun on a 3-2 count on seven pitches. Calhoun got to second on an Ezequiel Duran single, but Brown escaped damage by striking out Bubba Thompson swinging on a 3-2, 95.7 MPH four-seamer.\nBrown’s line in his first MLB appearance was impressive. He went six complete innings, giving up no runs on three hits, one walk, and five strikeouts. \nIn some ways, Brown confounded expectations. According to most analysts, Brown’s strengths as a pitcher are his velocity and stuff.  We expected great hit-and-miss ability. His Achilles heal is supposedly his command.\nYet today, Brown pleasantly surprised with excellent control, walking only one, getting 14 of 21 first-pitch strikes, and throwing 70.9% of all his pitches for strikes. \nSo much for rookie jitters.\nBut to be fair, the Rangers did manage to make good contact against Brown. Seven batted balls were hit for 100+ MPH or more, and three were hit at 94.8 - 100 MPH. Brown only managed a relatively modest eight swinging strikes out of 79 total pitches. Brown was helped by keeping the ball on the ground, getting ten groundouts against only two flyouts.\nBrown showed his full arsenal, getting eight outs on four-seamers that ranged between 95-97 MPH, seven outs on curves, and one out each on the slider and changeup. One of his sliders came in at an almost unbelievable 95 MPH.\nFollowing Brown, Astros relievers Bryan Abreu, Hector Neris, and Rafael Montero continued the Astros shutout of the Rangers, throwing a perfect inning each, respectively.\nHere’s a Hunter Brown 4-seam strikeout.\n\n\nHunter Brown, 96mph ⛽️ pic.twitter.com/L7cj6AQWd1— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nAnd here’s how his mechanics look compared to another notable Astros starter.\n\n\nHunter Brown vs. (his idol) Justin Verlander, Mechanics. pic.twitter.com/x8AKa1Q90C— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nThere was controversy in the eighth inning when Jose Altuve was called out trying to take home on a short pop-up by Yordan Alvarez. The original call stood after review, although from every angle except one, it appeared that Altuve was easily safe. If Altuve could have pulled it off, it would have been the shortest sacrifice fly in history most likely.\nThe Astros and Rangers meet again tomorrow at 7:10 CT.\nBox score and videos here.",

The glove’s nearly there.\nMichael Toglia’s most Todd Helton-esque moment came at the top of the second inning Monday at Coors Field, on a ball that left Jace Peterson’s bat the way the funny cars leave the line at Bandimere.\nWhile Toglia, the Rockies’ rookie first baseman, held Milwaukee’s Kolten Wong at the bag, Wong’s teammate Peterson fired a two-out screamer &#8212; exit velocity: 101 miles per hour &#8212; right at Toglia’s noggin.\nIt was the kind of ball that sends 98% of the free world to reconstructive nose surgery. Toglia tracked the stitches from the launch, did a pirouette and coolly swept it out of the air, the way a matador sweeps his muleta.\n“That was pure reaction,” the Rockies’ first baseman said after Monday’s 6-4 setback. “That’s either, you catch it or you take it off the teeth.”\nWith that, Toglia grinned. Every chiclet was clean and accounted for.\n“The last 24 hours, he hasn&#8217;t even had time to think,” Toglia’s girlfriend, Jenna Nastrini, told me Monday as her dude took warm-up swings at the on-deck circle in the bottom of the sixth.\n“I think (Monday night) will be his first moment of actually digesting it. Hopefully, (we’ll) grab some food, get some sleep and have a good, fun night game (Tuesday).”\nLet the kid get some rest before we start comparing him to Todd Helton, ya know?\nRockies general manager Bill Schmidt set the bar this past March when he likened Toglia, the Rockies’ first-round pick out of UCLA in 2109, to Helton, the premier first baseman in club history, the franchise’s gold standard.\nRelated Articles\n\nSports Columnists | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; growing pains apparent in loss to Brewers\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nSports Columnists | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies lose Lucas Gilbreath for the season; Jose Iglesias facing an MRI\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nSports Columnists | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; doubleheader split at Cincinnati leaves them with 3-7 road trip\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nSports Columnists | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe stories behind Albert Pujols&#8217; (many) home runs vs. the Rockies: &#8220;It&#8217;s a homer I&#8217;ll never forget until the day I die.&#8221;\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nSports Columnists | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSaunders: Truth is, Nolan Arenado was too good for the Rockies\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n“He should remind you of somebody,” Schmidt told The Post’s Patrick Saunders.\nIf Toglia’s Coors Field debut was any harbinger, the bat’s still got a ways to go to catch that somebody in particular.\nThe 24-year-old drew a first-inning walk to keep the line moving against Brewers starter Adrian Houser, helping the hosts to put up a 3-0 lead heading into the top of the second.\nResults were mixed after that, as the switch-hitting Toglia, who hit fifth, grounded out to short in the third, struck out looking in the sixth, and flew out to deep right in the top of the eighth as the potential tying run.\n“Triple-A pitching, Double-A pitching, is much different than the big leagues,” manager Bud Black said of the rookie. “And he&#8217;s figuring that out.\n“But he&#8217;s being competitive, which I liked. He&#8217;s got a good head on his shoulders.”\nAnd to be fair, that same head’s been spinning for much of the last 10 days or so. Nastrini said Toglia and his family figured they’d probably finish the season at the Rockies’ Triple-A affiliate in Albuquerque, where he was hitting everything in sight, so the call-up to the big club on Aug. 30 came as a happy shock. For everybody.\n“It&#8217;s been insane. I mean, all the nerves came out in Atlanta (during his Aug. 30 debut),” Nastrini recalled. “We were crying. We were laughing. We were sweating. It was just chaos that whole week.”\nJenna, who lives in Southern California, got a little Front Range teaser last week, as she landed for a layover in DIA en route to Atlanta. She recalled zipping up and down the concourses, trying in vain to find Rockies stuff to bring to the Braves’ Truist Field, before the second leg of her flight.\n“I was sleep deprived,” she laughed, “and was like, yelling at the person in the airport, ‘Do you hate baseball? Why are there no (Rockies souvenirs)?’”\nLabor Day was … calmer.\n“(Toglia) texted me when I flew in (this morning), and he goes, ‘I&#8217;m home.’ So it&#8217;s been a long time coming. He feels confident. He&#8217;s so excited to come play here. He feels at home here, being in the clubhouse and with all the staff.”\nThe staff might be a little shaky on some details, though. When Toglia’s bio first appeared on the Coors Field scoreboard, it announced that he’d made his MLB debut on June 7, 2011. When he was 12.\nApparently, the rookie wasn’t the only one who could’ve used a little more rest heading into Monday.\n“Give me a normal night’s (shut-eye) to get to the night game (Tuesday) and we&#8217;ll be ready,” said Toglia, who’s hitting 6 for 24 (.250) in his first taste of The Show. “We’ll be ready for this stretch.”\nEven if the rookie lost the game, he still won the race. In the top of the sixth, with two outs and the Rockies down 6-3, the first baseman fielded a rope up the line via the Brewers’ Garrett Mitchell &#8212; Toglia’s old UCLA teammate.\nThe sprinting rookie beat his buddy to the bag for the final out. If you’re wondering why that’s a big deal, Mitchell was expeditiously 34-for-36 on stolen bases over his last 132 minor league appearances.\n“All those years of racing each other,” Toglia said with a laugh. “So I guess that means I’m faster.”\nSpoiler alert: He isn’t.\n“I know,” Toglia said, beaming again. “But I took a hit away from him.”\nImagine what he could do after a little sleep.",

        "description": "Who knew the thin man trying escape from Lance Lynn’s body was Pedro Martinez? | Steph Chambers/Getty Images\n    \n\n  A little Lynn (not Loretta), a little Elvis (not Presley) and a little luck do the trick Lance Lynn discovered his inner Bert Blyleven, Elvis Andrus discovered his inner Aaron Judge, and the Seattle third base coach discovered his inner fear of challenging a defense, which was all enough for the White Sox to hang on for a squeaker over a Mariners team that was sleepless in Seattle. Well, that and a little luck.\nLynn eschewed his usual repertoire of fast ball A, fast ball B, and fast ball C to unveil a newly brilliant curve ball, taking advantage of a Mariners team that had  been in Cleveland until the wee hours to make a brilliant seven-inning start of 11 Ks, just one walk (against a team second in the league in free passes), three hits and one unearned run. Lynn got most of his strikeouts on curves, as well as most of his 25 swinging strikes, and retired the last 17 he faced.\nAJ Pollock put the Sox on the board first with a 358-foot line shot on a first-pitch changeup from Marco Gonzales in the second. \n\n\nOne pitch is all AJ Pollock needed!#ChangeTheGame | @NBCSChicago pic.twitter.com/MWL42j6mBv— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 5, 2022\n\n\n\nSeattle tied it up in the bottom half, but a Romy González single and a fly by Andrus that was just enough — by about an inch — to go off of Mitch Haniger’s glove and onto yellow paint.\n\n\nElvis has left the building.#ChangeTheGame | @NBCSChicago pic.twitter.com/2EMlZRCwZ8— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 5, 2022\n\n\n\nAndrus not only provided what proved to be two crucial runs with the homer, but made three really fine fielding plays, two on grounders and one on a line drive, without which the W would have been an L. His robberies are part of the reason the Mariners had the seven hardest-hit balls of the game, but little to show for it — a little good fortune mixed with good D there.\nThat was it for scoring until the bottom of the ninth. Kendall Graveman survived the eighth despite two absolute smashes, one nabbed by Andrus and the other a single, but it was Liam Hendriks who made things a little more exciting than they had to be.\nHaniger led off with a 107.5 mph single, was wild-pitched to second, then, after two outs, Hendriks walked pinch-hitting slugger Emilio Suarez (several usual Mariners starters didn’t start, presumably because of the rough turnaround) on four pitches. That brought up J.P. Crawford, who hits Liam well as a rule, and did so again, with a bloop single to right. For some reason, Sam Haggerty, who pinch-ran for Suarez, was held at third. \nTrue, the ball was in the hands of the only White Sox outfielders who can throw at all, Adam Engel, but when Engel’s throw was way wide, so that turned out to be a really bad decision, as challenging the outfield is a much better idea than challenging Hendriks, who closed the game out with a strikeout of Adam Frazier.\nThe win puts the Sox one game over .500 (again) at 68-67 (5-1 in games when Miguel Cairo made out the lineup) one game behind the Twins, who lost to the Yankees, and either one or two behind the Guardians, who were ahead of the Royals as of this writing.\nGame 2 of the series will be at 8:40 p.m. Central tomorrow, with Johnny Cueto facing fireballing righty Logan Gilbert.",

        "description": "An Irish regulator has fined Meta, the parent company of Instagram, about $400 million because the social media platform broke data protection laws, specifically pertaining to children’s privacy on the app, multiple news outlets reported.\n\n\n\nAccording to Politico, which was the first to report the news, the Irish Data Protection Commission penalized Meta with a fine of 405 million euros, just over $400 million, a sum that the regulator confirmed to the news outlet. \n\n\n\nThe Data Protection Commission didn't offer further details to Politico or to the New York Times, which also reported the news. But both outlets reported the fine was related to Meta violating the General Data Protection Regulation and how the data of children on the app is handled.\n\n\n\nThe Irish regulator launched an investigation into the app two years ago over phone numbers and email addresses that were available to the public from teenagers who had business accounts on the platform and for having the public-by-default accounts for children between the ages of 13 and 17, according to The New York Times. \n\n\n\nThe development comes as Meta and other social media networks are under increasing scrutiny, especially following an explosive investigation published by The Wall Street Journal last year. The Journal published information obtained by a former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen that detailed the extent to which Facebook knew the Instagram was unhealthy for teens.\n\n\n\n“This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago, and we’ve since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private,\" a Meta spokesperson told Politico regarding the Irish regulator's fine.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"Anyone under 18 automatically has their account set to private when they join Instagram, so only people they know can see what they post, and adults can’t message teens who don’t follow them. We engaged fully with the DPC throughout their inquiry, and we’re carefully reviewing their final decision.”\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Meta and the Data Protection Commission for comment.&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/red-sox-enrique-hernandez-agree-to-contract-extension.html",
        "description": "The Red Sox have gotten a jump on their offseason business, reportedly agreeing to a one-year contract extension with utilityman Enrique Hernández. The deal guarantees the Wasserman client $10MM for the 2023 season.\nHernández had been slated to hit free agency this winter, but he&#8217;ll bypass that opportunity for a third season in Boston. The longtime Dodger first hit the open market over the 2020-21 offseason, when he signed a two-year, $14MM pact with Boston. It was a surprisingly strong multi-year arrangement on the heels of back-to-back down seasons at the plate, but it quickly looked like a coup for chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom and his front office.\nThe Puerto Rico native posted arguably his best season to date in 2021. He tallied a personal-high 585 plate appearances and connected on 20 home runs and 19 doubles with an overall .250/.337/.449 slash line. Hernández walked at a robust 10.4% clip, only struck out 18.8% of the time and made a strong impact from a power perspective. Altogether, by measure of wRC+, his offensive production checked in nine percentage points above league average.\n\nHernández paired that well-rounded hitting output with his typically strong defense. As he has throughout his career, Hernández proved willing to bounce between the infield and outfield. He spent the bulk of his time in center field and at second base, with public defensive metrics placing him among the league&#8217;s best at the former position. On the heels of that strong first season in Fenway, Hernández deservedly earned Boston&#8217;s Opening Day nod in center field this year.\nThe 31-year-old hasn&#8217;t managed to replicate last year&#8217;s production though. He slumped to a .193/.266/.325 line through the season&#8217;s first month and has never fully gotten back on track. While Hernández has improved upon that particularly tepid early-season output, he&#8217;s posted below-average numbers at the dish in each month when healthy. He also lost a bit more than eight weeks to a strained right hip flexor that sidelined him from early June until the middle of August. Altogether, Hernández has gotten into 68 games and tallied 304 plate appearances, compiling a meager .219/.283/.354 showing with just six longballs.\nSome of Hernández&#8217;s underlying numbers have correspondingly gone in the wrong direction. His walks are down to a below-average 7.9% clip, while his rate of hard contact has plummeted from 43.2% to 34.4%. Perhaps the Red Sox are willing to attribute the offensive downturn, at least in part, to the hip issue through which Hernández was battling. Disappointing as his 2022 work at the plate has been, he has continued to rate as an above-average defensive center fielder. If he can recapture something resembling league average offense, Hernández would still be a valuable contributor &#8212; either as the regular center fielder or in a utility role that sees him bounce more frequently between the dirt and the grass.\nPresumably, Hernández will get the first crack at an everyday outfield role again. The Sox don&#8217;t have much in the way of established in-house alternatives, with former top prospect Jarren Duran struggling to a .218/.269/.355 line with bottom-tier defensive metrics through his first 90 big league games. For a Red Sox team that is looking to immediately return to contention after a disappointing 2022 campaign, penciling the 26-year-old into the Opening Day lineup is probably too risky. If Duran plays his way into an everyday job, Hernández could slide into a superutility capacity.\nOne could argue Boston should&#8217;ve aimed higher than either Hernández or Duran and sought an external upgrade in center field. Re-signing Hernández doesn&#8217;t expressly rule that out, although it&#8217;d seem to alleviate the pressure on Bloom and his staff to dip into very thin waters at the position. Aaron Judge, of course, is the top free agent who&#8217;ll be available but looks likely to command a salary approaching or exceeding $300MM. Aside from Judge, Brandon Nimmo is the only clear above-average center fielder who&#8217;s slated to hit the open market. The Rays are certain to buy out defensive stalwart Kevin Kiermaier (with whom Bloom is plenty familiar from his time in the Tampa Bay front office), but Kiermaier&#8217;s coming off a shaky offensive season of his own and recently underwent season-ending hip surgery.\nThe trade market may not offer many solutions either. Teams are sure to try to pry Bryan Reynolds away from the Pirates yet again, but no team has been successful (or seemingly even come close) to doing so. The A&#8217;s will probably listen to offers on Ramón Laureano, but he&#8217;s arguably a cleaner fit in a corner outfield spot than up the middle. Other trade candidates include the Royals Michael A. Taylor and the Cubs Rafael Ortega, but it&#8217;s not clear either is an upgrade over Hernández.\nIt&#8217;s the start of what figures to be a busy offseason in Boston. The Red Sox are facing the potential free agent departures of Xander Bogaerts, J.D. Martinez, Nathan Eovaldi, Michael Wacha and Rich Hill, among others. Assuming Bogaerts opts out of the remaining three years on his current contract, the Sox are slated to enter the offseason with a bit more than $70MM in guaranteed commitments for 2023 after accounting for Hernández&#8217;s deal. Rafael Devers headlines an arbitration class that&#8217;s likely to push that tally north of $90MM.\nThat still leaves plenty of room for a club that opened this year with a payroll above $206MM, per Cot&#8217;s Baseball Contracts. They&#8217;ll need to overhaul the pitching staff, address a middle infield position if Bogaerts departs, and perhaps look for upgrades at catcher and in a corner outfield spot. There&#8217;s a lot of work to be done this offseason. Today&#8217;s agreement to keep around a familiar player whom the organization clearly expects to right the ship marks the first of many key decisions on the horizon.\nJeff Passan of ESPN first reported Hernández and the Red Sox were in agreement on a one-year, $10MM extension.\nImage courtesy of USA Today Sports.",

        "description": "Photo by Ed Zurga/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The extra inning rules suck.  Despite overcoming two two-run deficits in the first nine innings, the Royals couldn’t do it a third time in extras and fell to the Guardians 6-5. It marks Kansas City’s 81st loss of the 2022 campaign. \nAfter getting roughed up against the White Sox last week, Brady Singer toed the slab attempting to return to his July/August form. Unfortunately for the right-hander, he wasn’t missing many bats.\nIn the top of the second, Cleveland tacked on two runs on a bunt from Austin Hedges and RBI-single by Myles Straw. \nAs for the Royals’ bats, they were silent through four against Triston McKenzie. However, the shutout didn’t last forever. In the home half of the fifth, rookie Drew Waters demolished a game-tying, two-run shot into the right field bullpen. The 400-foot blast was the first of Waters’s career. \n\n\nWaters hits his first major league home run!!

As soon as the page turned to the top of the sixth, the Guardians reclaimed the lead on a solo homer off the bat of Josh Naylor. A costly error from Singer allowed another run to cross the plate — extending Cleveland’s lead back to two runs. Since the All-Star Break, there hadn’t been a better bullpen in baseball than Cleveland’s. The Guardians last blown save had come roughly a month earlier. However, even the best can have off nights…which occurred at Kauffman Stadium Monday. In the bottom of the seventh, Kansas City trimmed the deficit to one on a sacrifice fly from Michael A. Taylor. In the ensuing inning, Salvador Perez tied the game on an RBI-double into the left field corner. \n\n\nSalvy ties the game! TV: Bally Sports Kansas CityStream: https://t.co/9lV7xqX4bx#Royals pic.twitter.com/BVdRMrB1ph— Bally Sports Kansas City (@BallySportsKC) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nWith the hope of giving the offense a chance to walk it off, Mike Matheny turned to Scott Barlow to keep the game tied. Behind a jaw-dropping defensive gem from Bobby Witt Jr, the Royals earned that chance. Though a failure to drive in the winning run with less than two outs in ninth sent the game to extras. \n\n\nBOBBY WITT JR.!!!! TV: Bally Sports Kansas CityStream: https://t.co/9lV7xqX4bx#Royals pic.twitter.com/EAvO75Hmv5— Bally Sports Kansas City (@BallySportsKC) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nIn the 10th, Carlos Hernandez was the man called upon. That move proved to be the wrong one, as Cleveland’s Oscar Gonzalez crushed a two-run double off the wall in left-center field.  \nTrailing by two for the third time in the game, the Royals had one more chance to cash in off the Guardians’ dominant bullpen. Only that third opportunity came against Emmanuel Clase, who had 24 consecutive saves. Kansas City brought the winning run to the plate but Clase slammed the door on the Royals and the night. \nThe Royals, 55-81, will try to avenge the loss tomorrow night.

With the usual speech and visuals from the steps of No 10 delayed by 24 hours thanks to the Queen’s “episodic mobility issues”, the papers had to make do with Truss smiling broadly after she defeated Rishi Sunak to take the Tory crown and later become Britain’s fourth prime minister in six years.
