Instead, Cook said, “I would love to convert you to an iPhone.”\nBut the person who asked the question, Vox Media’s LiQuan Hunt, came back with a valid complaint, saying that his mother can’t see the videos he sends her. It all comes down to a lack of interoperability between iMessage and RCS, both messaging systems that could...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "Photo by Ed Zurga/Getty Images\n    \n\n  A potential sweep of the Royals was lost, as was the chance to gain more ground in the AL Central Somewhere around the third inning of tonight’s game, I had a feeling and I turned it into a tweet. \n\n\nThis game has an 11-inning 2-1 bullshit loss funk to it.— Matt Lyons (@mattrly) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\nNow, you might be looking at that and thinking that it’s my fault the Guardians did, in fact, lose a 2-1 game with some absolute tomfoolery as the end. HOWEVER, it didn’t go to extras so I submit to the court that I did not, in fact, curse the team. Blame Emmanuel Clase instead. \nBut for real, joking aside, blame Clase. At least a little bit He’s still the best reliever in baseball, he’s still going to dominate from here on out, but he can’t win ‘em all. He was due a stinker like this sooner or later, and boy did he have one. \nClase wielded his typical cutter that immediately topped the pitch velocity charts, but tonight he couldn’t locate it to save his life (or this game). The end result was 19 pitches, zero swings and misses, and eight balls. I don’t think there’s anything terribly insightful to gather from Clase’s outing here, it was just a bad night and the guy pitched four games in the last three days. With Cody Morris filling in for an injured rotation and only going four innings, the bullpen was taxed. \nThis was Clase’s first blown save since May 5 against the Twins, and it’s the first time he’s allowed an earned run since Aug. 6 against the Astros. I think he’ll be OK. \nIf you don’t want to blame Clase, you could also blame the offense and no one would fault you for it. The Guardians outhit the Royals, 8-6, but couldn’t form a good sequence to score any runs. The typically clutch Andrés Giménez flying out with the bases loaded and two outs in the top of the first immediately made this game smell off.\nOwen Miller plated the Guards’ only runner of the evening with an RBI single in the top of the fourth. That followed Oscar Gonzalez hitting one of his two doubles on the day, and it was Miller’s third hit in his last two games. Is he turning a corner? His utterly disappointing at-bat in the eighth with an insurance run on base would leave me to believe no. At least we know we’ll see him get at-bats every single day to figure it out. \nThis all overshadows the fact that Cody Morris had a pretty solid outing for the second start of his career. He threw the most pitches he’s thrown in any game all season at any level, inducing eight swings and misses on 61 pitches. His cutter and changeup were both working well, which was a point of emphasis for him to improve after his rough debut last week. \nThe loss leaves Cleveland at 70-65 on the season — still good for first in the AL Central or fifth in the AL East.",

        "description": "Apparently tonight was supposed to be a Tatis bobblehead but that was changed to a Soto City Connect Shersey.\n    \n\n  Welcome to the Varsho. Don’t look at the score, watch the homers I must say. As exciting as the team has been recently, I am not looking forward to tonight’s game like I though I would be. This feels like a pivotal moment in the season and future. Last night was a heartbreaking defeat; the type that would have started a tailspin in the last two seasons. Plus, my last review was the Philly loss...Sincerely hoping the youth can prove me wrong tonight and continue giving us meaningful baseball (even if the postseason is a pipe dream still). \n\n\n\nToday's Lineups\n\n\n\n\nDIAMONDBACKS\nPADRES\n\n\n\n\nJosh Rojas - 3B\nHa-Seong Kim - SS\n\n\nKetel Marte - 2B\nJuan Soto - RF\n\n\nJake McCarthy - RF\nManny Machado - 3B\n\n\nEmmanuel Rivera - 1B\nJosh Bell - DH\n\n\nDaulton Varsho - DH\nJurickson Profar - LF\n\n\nCorbin Carroll - LF\nWil Myers - 1B\n\n\nCooper Hummel - C\nJake Cronenworth - 2B\n\n\nAlek Thomas - CF\nAustin Nola - C\n\n\nGeraldo Perdomo - SS\nJose Azocar - CF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTommy Henry - LHP\nYu Darvish - RHP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInnings 1-3\nThere were lots of fireworks in the first third of the game. Varsho homered in the second. CORBIN CARROL HOMERED right after him to go back-to-back for his first career home run! That gave the team a 2-0 lead in the second after an abysmally pathetic first that saw Darvish use 10 pitches to retire the side. \nOf course, when you have an unheralded rookie on the mound, anything can happen. And unfortunately for Tommy Henry, the regression monster continued to rear its head in the bottom of the second. San Diego got two home runs of their own, but the first was of the 2-fer variety....\nDarvish faced no opposition in the third. Henry hit Soto on the shoulder (in the first he nearly hit him, but the ball actually hit the bat knob and Hummel caught it for a K), but the rest was smooth sailing again. \n3-2 PADRES\nInnings 4-6\nSome more fireworks in the middle innings. Varsho hit his second homer of the game (first time in his career). But of course this is PetCo, notorious home run happy field - sarcasm-, so Myers followed up with a home run of his own in the bottom of the 4th. In the fifth, Soto came out (related to the HBP most likely), being replaced by Grisham. Thomas got himself a hustle double ruled a single with an error. He made it to third on a Perdomo sac bunt but Marte grounded into an inning ending double play after a Rojas walk. \nIn the bottom of the 6th, Grisham and Bell manufactured another San Diego run with some help from a horrible throw to second by Hummel. Middleton replaced Henry and pitched fairly well after that. Darvish did just fine for the Padres. \n5-3 PADRES\nInnings 7-9\nThis game felt over after the top of the 7th. In that inning Carroll doubled then Hummel walked. But Carroll broke for third on a failed steal attempt before Thomas walked. Walker then pinch hit for Perdomo and grounded into another inning ending double play. \nFrom that point, Melancon pitched a scoreless 7th with a four pitch Profar walk. Then we let Mantiply pitch (something I am learning to detest every time it happens) the 8th. He gave up a single to Nola who got second on a ground out and scored on a Kim double. \nThe 9th saw Hader come in to close out the game. He succeeded without issue. It took 9 pitches to retire Varsho, Carroll and Kelly (pinch hitting for Hummel). \n6-3 FINAL PADRES WIN\nConclusion\nThis game was easier to watch than I feared, but wasn’t fun overall. The young offense remained exciting, but the veterans were tough to watch all around. Poor Tommy Henry saw the regression monster rear its head for the second consecutive game. Yu Darvish was beatable tonight; we were just more beatable. \nFangraphs\n  \n        \n  \nComment of the Day\nNo doubter for the comment tonight. ISH was early with the insight into how we probably feel right now. A healthy thread tonight with 255 total comments at time of writing. \n  \n        \n  \nUp Next\nA day off on Thursday. But back in action by Friday. The snakes head to Denver to play German Marquez of the Rockies. Zach Davies takes the mound for the good guys. Time is 5:40pm Arizona Time, television is normal (no AppleTV shenanigans).",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/matt-wisler-elects-free-agency.html",
        "description": "Reliever Matt Wisler has gone unclaimed on outright waivers after being designated for assignment by the Rays this week, reports Darren Wolfson of SKOR North (on Twitter). He&#8217;s electing minor league free agency in lieu of an outright assignment, according to Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times (Twitter link).\nIt&#8217;s a bit of a surprise to see Wisler go unclaimed, as he&#8217;s currently amidst a decent campaign. He owns a 2.25 ERA across 44 innings over 39 appearances. Wisler has only struck out 19.9% of opponents, but he&#8217;s shown strong control. While he&#8217;s not missed many bats this year, Wisler has induced swinging strikes at an above-average rate in each of the prior three seasons. In both 2020-21, the Ohio native paired those whiffs with decent overall run prevention.\nStill, clubs are apparently apprehensive by Wisler&#8217;s dip in velocity. He&#8217;s averaging a career-low 89.7 MPH on his four-seam fastball this year. More important, his slider is down to 79.8 MPH after sitting at 81.5 MPH last year. Wisler leans almost exclusively on that breaker, turning to it on a staggering 91.5% of his offerings. He&#8217;s used the slider as his primary pitch four years running, but he&#8217;s continued to push his approach to greater extremes with each season. Despite turning almost exclusively to the slider, Wisler hasn&#8217;t encountered any sort of platoon issues. He&#8217;s actually fared better against opposite-handed hitters than righties over the past few seasons, including holding southpaws to a .186/.240/.314 line in 75 plate appearances in 2022.\nNow that he&#8217;s on the open market, Wisler will have the right to explore opportunities elsewhere. Players who join an organization after August 31 aren&#8217;t eligible for postseason play, however, so any signing team would only be able to install him in the bullpen for the final few weeks of the regular season. Wisler has surpassed his sixth year of major league service this season, so he&#8217;d be eligible for free agency again at the end of the year even if he signs for the stretch run.\nIt&#8217;s possible Wisler just turns his attention to 2023 at this stage on the calendar, but there&#8217;d be no financial downside for another team adding him for the final few weeks if he&#8217;s searching for a more immediate opportunity. The Rays are responsible for what remains of his $2.16MM salary, while another team would only owe him the prorated portion of the $700K minimum if he finds another MLB job (which would be subtracted from Tampa Bay&#8217;s obligations).",

When assessing the long-term ramifications of the AFL’s extraordinary broadcast deal this week, it is an adage to consider given a slight shift towards pay TV.Between 2025 and 2031, the first eight rounds of the men’s AFL season will be screened or streamed exclusively by Foxtel on Saturday, the most traditional day of the football calendar, and the seven-season, $4.5bn deal with incumbent broadcasters Foxtel, Telstra and the Seven Network requires some mental gymnastics when assessing the significant positives and potential pitfalls.

        "description": "It’s true that the UK Treasury thrives under the pressure of a crisis, from the 2007 financial crash to the Covid pandemic – but is its self-hyped reputation as the bedrock of government stability really deserved?There is a flattering story that the Treasury likes to tell about itself. Picture the scene in March 2020, Covid spreading fast around the world and countries implementing shutdowns and border closures. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, underestimating the problem, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, dithering. Government ministers praying for a modest death rate before herd immunity kicked in.Then, from the chaos, emerges someone with a real plan and a crack team: the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and behind him, the Treasury, peopled with the top brains of the civil service. “Whatever it takes,” says Sunak, as hundreds of billions of pounds are found and committed to the nation’s safety. The Treasury rolls out an extensive furlough and business support scheme. This ensures that the economy remains afloat while people can stay safe at home. Continue reading...",

The case for LLL can be made by pointing to technological, geographic or demographic changes, among others. It recommends proponents \"place LLL firmly on national policy agendas, and identify public policy issues where the adoption of LLL has significant comparative advantages\" (p. 16) and continues along that line, linking LLL to (for example) the sustainable development goals (SDG) and tracking this to recommendations for implementation. The handbook concludes with a case study of a 'learning city'.\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

        "description": "Ben Dickson, \nTechTalks, \nSept 08, 2022\n\n\n\t\t           \n\t\t           To 'be honest' is to have the possibility of telling a falsehood, but to choose not to do so. It's something that can be attributed to devices - we would ask, for example, whether a scale gave an honest weight. But normally we think it has to do with intention; the agent has to know what they're saying isn't true. But if an AI simply can't distinguish between truth and falsehood (as appears to be the case when we look at some of the nonsense it produces) then there's no way to say it can be honest. Right? Well, not so fast. As this article points out, while an AI is always ready with a response to a question, it can calculate degrees of uncertainty about the answer. \"Having language models express their uncertainty is a crucial aspect of honesty: there will always be things that models don't know for sure, and so uncertainty is necessary for conveying the model's knowledge faithfully.\"\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

On Wednesday night, after a good team effort to come back, the Astros reached another victory, though this time they were helped by the rival pitcher as Jonathan Hernández threw a wild pitch to let the final run to score. After the first three innings, the Astros were down 3-0.\nThe game did not offer a good beginning for Houston. Nathaniel Lowe homered off starter Cristian Javier in the first inning. Later, in the third, the Rangers used two RBI singles from Marcus Semien and Kole Calhoun to make it 3-0.\nBut fortunately, Javier was better eventually. The righty did not surrender a hit since the fourth inning until completing 5 1/3 innings of four hits, three runs (one earned), two walks, and eight strikeouts.\nOffensively, the Astros reacted in the fourth with a Yuli Gurriel RBI single to shrink the gap 3-1.\nTwo innings later, in the sixth, Kyle Tucker clubbed his second homer of the month and 24th overall. The two-run blast tied the score at three and gave us a bullpen duel won by Houston.\n\n\nWill the real King please stand up. pic.twitter.com/F07Twc2nz5— Houston Astros (@astros) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\nSeth Martínez, Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero, and Héctor Neris all did a wonderful job to keep the chances intact until the Astros took advantage of the ghost runner in the 10th innings. With Hernández on the mound and after issuing two intentional walks, he threw a wild pitch after the first offering to Alex Bregman. That was it, game over (4-3).\n\n\nLet's get wild. pic.twitter.com/t9wsU2tNG2— Houston Astros (@astros) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Astros have won seven of the last nine games and will try to follow that on Friday, when they’ll begin a three-game series against the Angels. Lance McCullers will face Anaheim in the series opener.\nVIDEOS AND BOX SCORE.",

        "description": "Taken into care, abused, objectified: the actor had a traumatic start to life – and her career. Why does she feel such a strong connection to her new TV role: privileged, notorious Catherine de Medici?Not so long ago, Samantha Morton was given a relic from her past – her application form to join Nottingham’s Central Junior Television Workshop (one of the organisation’s leaders, clearly proud of Morton’s success, had hung on to it). It had asked her to list what she wanted to be when she grew up. Prime minister, she wrote, followed by novelist and actor. She laughs, remembering it. We had been talking about whether she might go into politics one day – not such a leap for an actor who is intensely political (the “novelist” bit might have to wait). But it also seems to sum up so much else about the young Sam I’m picturing, defiant blue eyes staring out from the scrappy passport photo that would have been stapled to the corner of the sheet. Drive and ambition, and a feeling that despite everything she had been through by that point – in and out of care for years, subjected to physical and sexual abuse – that her hopes and dreams could be as big as anyone’s.Through immense talent, luck and sheer force of will, Morton, 45, did make it – Hollywood success, indie superstardom, two Oscar nominations, a Bafta for the first film she directed, and now starring roles in big TV shows. She was in The Walking Dead, playing Alpha, the leader of a zombie army, and has just been announced as the lead in another series, The Burning Girls. Her latest is in The Serpent Queen, as Catherine de Medici, the 16th-century queen of France, vilified throughout history, but portrayed here by Morton with characteristic empathy (and based on the biography by Leonie Frieda).

        "description": "Antonioni’s 1982 film, in which a sexually restless middle-aged film-maker auditions young women, feels dated but has pleasing flourishesMichelangelo Antonioni’s long slide from critical favour may or may not be reversed by the re-release of this late work from 1982, a midlife or latelife crisis of a movie that Antonioni made at the age of 70 and was his last serious solo directorial work. (I would much prefer to see a revival of his tremendous and neglected film The Lady Without Camelias from 1953.)Anyway, this revives his signature themes – metaphysical mystery, existential anxiety, sexual obsession – and there are some definite, pleasing flourishes. But unfortunately, as with the later movies of Fellini, there are some softcore sex scenes and a preposterously romanticised and eroticised search for the ideal (and sexually available) woman; the concept of the sexually restless middle-aged film-maker auditioning young women to be in his movies jars a little.

        "description": "Jared Young | Photo by Buck Davidson/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Iowa is still undefeated in the state of Florida. South Bend’s bullpen melted down in a late loss.  The Midwest League announced their Player and Pitcher of the Month of August today and the South Bend Cubs swept the awards with Pete Crow-Armstrong and Luis Devers winning the two awards.\nCrow-Armstrong hit .356 for the month of August with three home runs, 18 runs scored and 17 RBI. Crow-Armstrong had a .417 OBP for the month and a SLG of .535. He also stole 12 bases in 17 attempts.\nDevers made four starts for South Bend in August and went 1-0 with a 1.35 ERA. He gave up just three runs in 20 innings and did not allow more than one run, earned or otherwise, in any of his starts. Devers struck out 20 batters, walked just four and held opposing hitters to a .149 batting average in August.\nIowa Cubs\nThe Iowa Cubs peeled the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp (Marlins), 3-1.\nAnderson Espinoza loaded the bases with three walks in the first inning, but he escaped without any runs scoring. That was his story tonight as Espinoza tossed four scoreless innings before exiting. Espinoza gave up four hits, he walked just the three and he struck out two.\nBecause Espinoza did not go five innings, the win went to Bryan Hudson. Hudson tossed two innings without giving up a run or a hit. He did walk one batter while striking out two.\nBen Leeper pitched the ninth inning and got the save, but not before giving up a run on two hits. He struck out one and walked no one.\nLeft fielder Jared Young had an RBI single in the fourth inning and an RBI double in the sixth. He went 2 for 4.\nCatcher Tyler Payne was 2 for 4.\nTennessee Smokies\nThe game in Pensacola was postponed for unplayable conditions. They will try to play a doubleheader on Friday.\nSouth Bend Cubs\nThe South Bend Cubs were popped by the Cedar Rapids Kernels (Twins), 8-4.\nLuis Devers wasn’t as sharp  as he had been, but he still only allowed one run on four hits over 4.2 innings. Devers did walk four batters (as many as he walked all last month!) and he struck out four.\nThe Kernels scored six runs in the bottom of the eighth inning off Michael McAvene and Jake Reindl. McAvene’s got the loss. His final line was three runs on one hit and two walks over 1.2 innings. One of those hits was a solo home run.

        "description": "Forget the chilly perfection of marble sculpture – a Cambridge classicist presents ancient bodies in all their fleshy fallibilityThink of the Greek or Roman body, and what might come to mind is the chilly perfection of a marble sculpture. The Apollo Belvedere, for example: a Roman copy of a Hellenistic original, rediscovered in the Renaissance, installed in the Vatican by Julius II, regarded as “the miracle of art” by 18th-century German art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann.In Exposed, Cambridge classicist Caroline Vout takes a very different approach. The bodies she considers are fallible and fleshy; they are sticky, malodorous and unpredictable. Some are disabled. Some are enslaved, abused or exploited. (There is a particularly sobering passage on the law code of Gortyn in Crete which, in the fifth century BC, recorded that if a free man raped a free woman he was fined 1,200 obols. For the rape of an enslaved woman the fine was 1 obol – or 24 if she was a virgin.) Continue reading...",

        "description": "Putting the team on his back: Mark Payton went 4-for-5 with two homers and a double during Charlotte’s 9-8 victory. | Laura Wolff/Charlotte Knights\n    \n\n  Charlotte’s Mark Payton was responsible for most of Wednesday’s highlights   \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nThe Knights came out on top in a wild game against the Sounds.\nCharlotte took an early lead thanks to a two-out rally in the second. With runners on first and second, Indiana Hoosier Craig Dedelow and Zach Remillard drew back-to-back walks to force in a run. Then, Mark Payton drove in a pair with a double to make it 3-0. Things got even better in the third, when Carlos Pérez hit a solo home run to extend the lead to four.\nKnights starter Kyle Kubat had a rough fourth inning, though the defense struggled to do him any favors. With one out and nobody on base, a Lenyn Sosa error opened the door for a Sounds rally, and they capitalized. After a double, a pop out, a three-run homer, a single, and a two-run homer, Nashville had a 5-4 lead. Because all of those runs scored with two outs after the error, Kubat was not charged with any earned runs.\nPayton continued showing off his power with a solo blast in the bottom of the fourth to tie the game, 5-5, and in the fifth, the Knights distanced themselves from Nashville. Adam Haseley drove in a run with a single, and after a double-steal by Yolbert Sánchez and Haseley that was aided by a throwing error, it was 7-5. Dedelow added an exclamation point with a double to make it 8-5.\nNashville scored once in the sixth against reliever Kade McClure, and it pulled within one in the eighth, when Dan Winkler allowed a run. However, Payton poured cold water on Nashville’s comeback attempt when he launched his second homer of the day in the bottom of the eighth.\nReliever Lane Ramsey issued three walks in the ninth, but although he allowed a run, he held on for the save.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nIt was a rough day for Barons hitters, as they only managed three measly singles in a 3-0 loss.\nBarons starter Jared Kelley issued five walks in four innings, but he ensured that the free passes did not come back to bite him. Incredibly, Kelley lasted four scoreless innings.\nThe bad news was that despite Kelley's ability to pitch out of trouble, the game was still scoreless when the starter exited. In the fifth, reliever Emilio Vargas took over on the mound, and he allowed a run on a double by Mike Siani. Despite that, Vargas had a nice day, only allowing one run over four innings. But it was not enough, as the Barons offense was ice-cold. As for hits, Wilfred Veras had one single, and Luis Mieses had two. That was it.\nSiani added a pair of insurance runs in the ninth with a two-run triple against Caleb Freeman.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nThe Cyclones used a huge third inning to pull away from the Dash on Wednesday night.\nThe Dash struck first, as they scored a pair in the bottom of inning No. 1. Andy Atwood, Alsander Womack, and Ben Norman started off with three consecutive singles to open the inning. Norman’s single drove in the first run of the game for either team, and Riley Jepson padded the early lead with a sacrifice fly.\nThe score remained 2-0 until the top of the third, when Brooklyn woke up against Winston-Salem starter Hunter Dollander. The Cyclones got five runs on six hits, and the last two of those hits were home runs. The second home run wrapped up Dollander’s outing. Dollander only lasted 2 2⁄3 innings due to the disastrous third frame.\nThe Dash bullpen was phenomenal, allowing only two hits in 6 1⁄3 scoreless innings. Unfortunately, it was not enough, as the Dash offense got quiet down the stretch. Winston-Salem finished 1-for-7 with runners in scoring position.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nThe Cannon Ballers scored two in the first, and they almost made it so that those runs were enough, but Augusta rallied just in time.\nJordan Sprinkle drew a dreaded, leadoff walk for Kannapolis in the bottom of the first. Three batters later, with two outs, Tim Elko launched a two-run shot to give the Cannon Ballers an early lead.\nCannon Ballers starter Martin Carracci allowed the GreenJackets to get one of those runs back in the second, but that was the only run he allowed. He struck out five in 4 1⁄3 innings.\nThe score remained 2-1 until the ninth, when Augusta got a leadoff walk that was followed by an RBI triple against Adisyn Coffey. Fortunately, Coffey got out of the inning with the tie intact, as a harmless pop fly and an unassisted double play by third baseman Brooks Baldwin got the job done.\nHowever, the GreenJackets drove in their free base runner in the top of the 10th with a double. Meanwhile, the Cannon Ballers were kept off the board for the ninth consecutive inning, so they took the loss in extras.",

        "description": "Today, in Texas, U.S. District Judge Reed O&#8217;Connor undercut a key part of the Affordable Care Act, more popularly known as Obamacare. That law assigned to three different government bodies the task of deciding what preventative treatments&#8212;cancer screenings, vaccines, and so on&#8212;health plans must cover. In Braidwood Management v. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, various business owners and individuals opposed buying insurance that covered some of those treatments, citing either economic or religious grounds. Four individuals wanted to be able to buy health insurance that did not include PrEP drugs to prevent HIV infection, contraception, the HPV vaccine, or screenings and counseling for STDs and drug use. The plaintiffs say they do not need such care and being forced to participate in plans that cover that care &#8220;violates their religious beliefs by making them complicit in facilitating homosexual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity outside of marriage between one man and one woman.&#8221; Two Christian businesses have similar complaints, while one other business and one other individual simply say they don&#8217;t want or need this coverage. (One says his wife &#8220;&#8216;is past her childbearing years,&#8217; and neither he nor his family members &#8216;engage in the behaviors that makes [sic] this preventive treatment necessary.&#8221;)O&#8217;Connor is famous for his decisions against the federal government. In a 2018 decision, he tried to get rid of the ACA altogether, but the Supreme Court upheld the law by a vote of 7&#8211;2. Today, in Braidwood Management v. Becerra, he decided that the members of one of the three panels deciding preventive treatments have been appointed unconstitutionally and upheld the argument that the PrEP requirement violated the plaintiffs&#8217; religious rights. He reserved his ruling on how to fix these issues.Also in the news today is Moore v. Harper, a North Carolina case about whether state legislatures alone have the power to set election rules even if those laws violate state constitutions. The case is currently before the Supreme Court, and friend of the court briefs are flowing in to make arguments either for Timothy Moore, speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, and the rest of the petitioners, or for defendant Rebecca Harper, a North Carolina voter, and the rest of the respondents. The case comes from North Carolina, where the state supreme court rejected a dramatically partisan gerrymander by the Republican state legislature. Republicans say that the state court cannot stop the legislature&#8217;s carving up of the state because of the &#8220;independent state legislature doctrine.&#8221; This is a new idea that caught on in 2015, when Republicans wanted to get rid of an independent redistricting commission in Arizona. It is based on the clause in the U.S. Constitution providing that &#8220;[t]he Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.&#8221;Until now, states have interpreted &#8220;legislatures&#8221; to mean the state&#8217;s general lawmaking processes, which include shared power and checks and balances among the three branches of state government. Now a radical minority insists that a legislature is a legislature alone, unchecked by state courts or state constitutions that prohibit gerrymandering.Why now?Democrats are actually far more popular than Republicans in most states, and they win elections that are statewide, like those for the U.S. Senate, governor, or U.S. president. But state legislatures control the way state districts are carved up, and after 2010, when Republicans made a concerted effort to take over state houses through a plan called Operation REDMAP, they gerrymandered the states they control to the point that Democratic voters cannot win the number of seats their votes reflect.Biden narrowly won Georgia in 2020, for example, but a new districting map has given Republicans an advantage of at least 15 points for control of the state House of Representatives. Democrats will have to win the state by double digits in order to flip the House. That party power leads to extremist legislation, for once in power, legislators in safe seats can operate without fear of being voted out and can vote for measures that cater to their extremist base rather than to the wishes of the majority. This partisan gerrymandering skews Congress as well. According to political scientist Jacob Grumbach of the University of Washington, North Carolina, for example, was actually a leader in expanding access to voting in the 1970s. But after Republicans captured the legislature in 2010, they changed election laws so dramatically that in 2018, Republicans won 49.3% of the vote and yet captured 77% (10 of 13) of the state&#8217;s seats in Congress.Grumbach identifies 2010 as a crucial shift for democracy in a number of states. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about [Republican] control,&#8221; he says. &#8220;When the [Republican Party] wins your state, it will reduce democracy.&#8221; The changes don&#8217;t reflect major changes in the states themselves; rather, both the big money interests of the Republican Party and the electoral base, which is motivated by white identity politics, want to keep voting limited. Those advancing the independent state legislature theory want to be able to gerrymander their states, but they also point to another clause of the Constitution. It says: &#8220;Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legis&#173;lature thereof may direct, a Number of Elect&#173;ors.&#8221; They advance the idea that the legislature can choose the state&#8217;s presidential electors regardless of which candidate the majority of the state&#8217;s voters choose. This doctrine is, of course, what Trump and his allies pushed for to keep him in power in 2020: Republican state legislatures throwing out the will of the people and sending electors for Trump to Congress rather than the Biden electors the majority voted for. Not surprisingly, those writing friend of the court briefs defending the independent state legislature doctrine are a who&#8217;s who of those who backed Trump&#8217;s effort to convince state officials to write slates of electors for Trump rather than Biden. They include America First Legal Foundation, which Democracy Docket identifies as connected to Trump advisor Stephen Miller and Trump&#8217;s chief of staff Mark Meadows; America&#8217;s Future (Trump&#8217;s national security advisor Michael Flynn); Claremont Institute&#8217;s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence (John Eastman, author of the Eastman memo for overturning the 2020 election); Honest Elections Project (Leonard Leo); Public Interest Legal Foundation (Eastman and Trump lawyer Cleta Mitchell), Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections (Trump&#8217;s attorney general Bill Barr), and so on. In contrast, a conference consisting of the Supreme Court chief justices or chief judges of the courts of last resort of all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, urged the Supreme Court not to decide that the state legislatures could operate without any oversight. Relying on the long history of state court review of the legislatures&#8217; decisions, including those over elections, it concluded that state courts had a traditional role to play in reviewing election laws under state constitutions.Revered conservative judge J. Michael Luttig has been trying for months to sound the alarm that the independent state legislature doctrine is a blueprint for Republicans to steal the 2024 election. In April, before the court agreed to take on the Moore v. Harper case, he wrote: &#8220;Trump and the Republicans can only be stopped from stealing the 2024 election at this point if the Supreme Court rejects the independent state legislature doctrine&#8230;and Congress amends the Electoral Count Act to constrain Congress&#8217; own power to reject state electoral votes and decide the presidency.&#8221;And yet in March, when the Supreme Court let the North Carolina Supreme Court&#8217;s decision against the radical map stay in place for 2022, justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas, and Brett Kavanaugh indicated they are open to the idea that state courts have no role in overseeing the rules for federal elections.In the one term Trump&#8217;s three justices have been on the court, they have decimated the legal landscape under which we have lived for generations, slashing power from the federal government, where Congress represents the majority, and returning it to states, where a Republican minority can impose its will. Thanks to the skewing of our electoral system, those states are now trying to take control of our federal government permanently.&#8212;Notes:https://www.vox.com/2021/4/2/22360341/obamacare-lawsuit-supreme-court-little-sisters-kelley-becerra-reed-oconnor-nondelegationhttps://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/braidwood-becerra-ruling-usdc-texas.pdfhttps://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/9/7/23341076/obamacare-reed-oconnor-prep-supreme-court-braidwood-becerra-affordable-care-acthttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/us/politics/texas-judge-obamacare.htmlhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-redistricting-affects-the-battle-for-state-legislatures/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/07/opinion/democracy-states-america.htmldropbox.com/s/c682q88keqyc&#8230;\\n\\n1/n &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;JakeMGrumbach&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Jake M.

        "description": "Just published in paperback by Icon Books, Kat Lister&#8217;s &#8216;The Elements: A Widowhood&#8217; is not a pallid story of survival, writes Kirsteen McNish, but an account of things that oscillate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;At 35 years old, Kat Lister started to piece her life back together from the ashes and aligned herself to the elements to re-shape and re-imagine how things might look when peering down a chasm of loss. Setting sail stuttering into the unknown after her husband died after being diagnosed with a brain tumour, she finds herself living a totally different trajectory to the one she had imagined for herself and her relationship. How many of us even think further than tomorrow, next week, the next year? Facing a maelstrom of unexpected dawning chaos, one’s life can become a radical act of will — to emerge every morning out of slumber into a gaping reality that no one could have prepared you for. The sticky tar days. The days that seem to have no end. The whys and what ifs. The split second when you wake up in the morning and you forget it has happened. Then the rebuilding. Fire, Water, Earth and Air here are the weathervanes Lister chooses to guide her and inhabit.\n\n\n\nThe Elements is a lyrical, hypnotic, rich, beautifully composed, intricate and delicate tapestry of a book. But it is also subversive. From the outset Lister was determined to have the word &#8216;Widowhood&#8217; emblazoned across the cover as a sub-heading; a brave step for both an author and a publishing house. Much easier not to confront the reader and merely artfully allude to something in a shy side-glance on the cover. This book is not presumptuous about the highly individual nature of loss, and its author does not attempt to tick the non-sequential Kubler-Ross stages off like a crude shopping list. Instead, Lister flies in the face of presumptions and etched-in expectations of gender, and refuses to be sacrificed on the altar of &#8216;widowhood&#8217; — by doing so also freeing the reader&#8217;s expectations; she is not presuming to be a voice for anyone other than herself, and so for those readers who may have experienced loss themselves, it’s sweet relief not to be lumped into one swirling mass of generalisation from the outset, allowing the text to both breathe and soar.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAside from being beautifully observant, self-reflective, poetic, and delicately woven, it is written by someone who, despite everything she encounters, has an ache to absorb as much as she can, whether that’s voraciously reading texts or travelling in her quest to keeping looking outward; she throws up often, doesn’t sleep, dances, fucks, retreats, and starts again. By doing this she allows herself to surrender to something bigger than herself. The Elements is not a pallid story of survival, it’s an account of things that oscillate, and reflects the world around and beyond us; \n\n\n\nGrief isn’t a one-dimensional experience, but an oscillating process that mirrors the natural cycles we all learned about in biology class, the repeating patterns that can be found almost everywhere in our natural world…Spirals, waves, tessellations, symmetry, like the expanding universe around us we are a symphony of restless change.\n\n\n\nLet’s be candid. Sharing perspectives on the very thing that most of us do not want to address — death, grief, caring, and failure of the body to align with one&#8217;s will — is the bow and arrow of this biographical account. One gets the real raw deal here, not an account which is neatly sewn up into palatable morsels — it lives and breathes organically and undulates as Lister works out how to forge a pathway ahead of her.&nbsp;She somehow also manages to both embrace her contradictions and be brutally honest — she refuses to fulfil the noble, benign or old-as-the-hills passive depiction of a woman bereaved, and by doing so reclaims herself; is always resolutely her own person caught between shifting seismic plates of a personal earthquake. Life after loss, one feels for Lister, is a process of experimentation; testing the boundaries, regaining trust, self-respect and the ability to skip across quicksand.&nbsp; She is also very aware that by doing this she is often in conflict with herself, playing a role to deal, to preserve some control, when everything is in freefall. This account is complex, devastating, but also uplifting because as a reader we can somehow walk with her, not least because she is acutely aware of the sensory and is able to subtly convey micro-emotions as multifaceted as rock strata or ridges in one’s fingerprints.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe explores sex and self-pleasuring once her libido finally gallops home (“the wanking chapter” as she deadpanned at a recent festival event), and the highs and lows of hooking up then checking out — desirous of human connection and yet still aware she is at times a cork that’s bobbing in the ocean. But however poignant the accounts, there is always a deep humour and self-awareness. She also throws a light on, nay flies a flag, for what in essence it is to be a “carer”, which is something that isn’t much talked about in literature, and one wonders why, as one in four of us will care for someone we love in our lifetimes, won&#8217;t we then feel a need to be acknowledged without pity but with respect? I came away feeling more than ever that this is a writer who wishes to bring visibility to those whose stories are often kept in the shadows and should be seen rather than pigeonholed or marginalised. She emblazons a kind of graffiti that is hard to scrub off;\n\n\n\nOn the morning of my husband’s funeral, I put on crimson lipstick, and zipped my feet into a pair of ruby red boots, sartorial choices that subconsciously sparred with my new status. Yes, they said, I had chosen to be a 30-year-old bride, but I hadn’t asked to be this 35 year old widow.\n\n\n\nLister’s visceral prose reaches its most confrontational as her body is turned inside out and upside down as she and her partner go through IVF, and relentless hospital appointments, during his prognosis — a searing holding of the flame. The medicalisation of her body can make the reader wince, but never do we feel she is admonishing the reader in these insights. Lister is not trying to be an everyman, but rather she is opening a door — allowing the reader to step into someone else’s frame, and letting the light rush through the cracks, bringing forth strip-light illumination;\n\n\n\nIt’s hard to do even now, to stand on the charred ground and look down. I’m giving it a go for the sake of the story, but I’m not sure it’s possible to rake over the past and examine what happened without neatening it a little or smoothing over the rough surface in some way. I can squish down the main details into a couple of paragraphs, but it doesn’t give you the messy bits I have tried to block out, and it is the messy bits I need to confront.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a world of social media echo chambers and deftly swerving certain subjects (unless fictional accounts that are perhaps acceptably distanced enough for the reader or viewer) this is a truly refreshing read. Lister too kicks against allowing her partner&#8217;s memory to disintegrate into the two-dimensional, and — something we might all wish for in the event of our own lives being reflected upon — her partner Pat is both honoured and depicted in rich detail enough to get a real sense of who he was; his humour, pragmatism, positive outlook and intellect allowing his imprint to hover long after I closed the final pages. In one passage the writer relays an image of one her partner&#8217;s legs slightly raised before he spins on a dancefloor, which conjured up such a strong scene I felt I was there at a pub table, surrounded by the smell of beer, the night outside — and was taken apart. That a real person is depicted and not merely a chain of anecdotes blurred by the fog of time is a kind of sorcery in itself;\n\n\n\nWhen I talk of my husband, I often speak of disparate worlds. Mine is inside time, his is supertemporal. I continue to age whilst my husband stays fixed in a past I am drifting further away from with every sentence that I type. And yet, like those luminous balls of plasma in the sky, we are still connected together, for all time is cyclical. I hold the elements within me.\n\n\n\nLister works to inhabit the dissociative experiences common with trauma and instead chooses connect actively with her experiences, to inhabit them and connect with her body, from the slaps she administers to herself upon first hearing the prognosis from her partner down the phone, to re-finding herself sometime after his death sexually and sensually. In her honesty and frankness she is comet-like and blazes a trail.\n\n\n\nThere is so much tenderness in this book too; a paean to the things we grasp around for to steady us in the haar. Passages that discuss retrieving items from a plastic bag (such as a shaving cream or half-used deodorant) and placing them back in her bathroom, the curve of her partner&#8217;s fingers having left their invisible imprint, leaves a deep and familiar impression. (I will never forget seeing the shoe of my late sister on its side on her living room carpet and how I felt that it was somehow waiting for her like a fly trapped in amber). I cannot also help but think of the artist Alison Watt’s exhibition A Portrait Without Likeness and how these held or adorned objects separated out from the portrait wearer (a feather or a rose for instance) take on their own new meaning and yet still reflect the strange dance between permanence and transience.\n\n\n\nThere is much to say about the depths of this book, that lingers on long after in the ether, and I admit I cannot fully do it justice in all its kaleidoscopic glory. But to read this book one feels both seen and like the seer ; the most unusual of portholes, and one that allows us to fall and rise between the seabed and the distant shimmering horizon. To call this a book on bereavement or for the bereaved is far too reductive — there is somehow a part of all of us all lingering, somewhere, in The Elements.\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n&#8216;The Elements: A Widowhood&#8217; is out now in paperback.\n\n\n\nKat Lister will be in conversation with author and broadcaster Jude Rogers on 13th September at The Social, London.

        "description": "Michael Frayn’s comedy is not just extremely funny but also acknowledges the fragile artifice of order – in theatre and the world beyondAll plays, wrote critic John Lahr, are dated. He meant, I assume, that all plays are inevitably products of a particular historical moment. But the best plays also transcend their time and that is palpably true of Michael Frayn’s Noises Off. This month a 40th anniversary production of the classic farce, starring Felicity Kendal, Tracy-Ann Oberman and Matthew Kelly, opens at the Theatre Royal in Bath before heading off on a short tour.Viewed logically, Frayn’s caprice should by now have had its day. After all it is predicated on the performance of an antic farce, Nothing On, that has distinct echoes of Ben Travers, Brian Rix and Ray Cooney; and, although the last of these is buoyantly alive, no one could pretend their work is still a staple of the touring circuit. But Frayn is not simply writing a witty pastiche but also charting the progressive deterioration of his play-within-a-play. A nightmare dress-rehearsal is followed by a vision of backstage mayhem and finally a descent into public madness.Noises Off is at Theatre Royal Bath, 22 September-1 October; Richmond theatre, 4-15 October; Theatre Royal Brighton, 18-22 October; and Cambridge Arts theatre, 25-29 October.

        "description": "State use of federal infrastructure dollars to prioritize highway expansions over repairs could waste billions of dollars and worsen the impacts of climate change, a new report has found.\n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;report, published on Thursday by the U.S. Public Interest Research Groups (U.S. PIRG), urged state lawmakers to reexamine proposed highway expansion projects — while taking into account the evolving transportation needs of the American public.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Every time we spend money on infrastructure, we have an opportunity to re-envision the future,” Matt Casale, director of U.S. PIRG Education Fund’s environment campaigns, said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We should not invest in highway boondoggles that will exacerbate our pollution and global warming problems,” Casale continued. “The projects that we choose to invest in should be ones that are going to make American lives better.”\n\n\n\nStates have found themselves with funds to make such decisions following November’s passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which seeks to modernize transportation across the U.S.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the infrastructure law, the report authors noted, gives states the flexibility to choose how best to spend much of the funds they receive. Many states are advancing billions of dollars’ worth of highway expansion projects, funds for which the authors argued would be better spent on attending to maintenance backlogs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfter highlighting 66 highway boondoggles in seven previous reports, U.S. PIRG Education Fund focused in Thursday’s edition on seven new highway projects that would cost a total of more than $22 billion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“America can't afford to squander our historic investment in infrastructure on boondoggle projects,” lead author James Horrox, a policy analyst at the Frontier Group, a Denver-based nonprofit organization, said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“And yet, across the country, wasteful and damaging highway expansion projects are often first in line for public dollars,” Horrox added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe most expensive project is a $16 billion proposal to widen the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway — plans that would result in the addition of hundreds of miles of new lanes on two of the country’s busiest roads, according to the report.\n\n\n\nRealizing these ambitions could mean “undermining New Jersey’s emissions reduction goals,” the authors argued.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA $2.8 billion plan to construct a 10-lane, double-decker bridge across the Ohio River could “exacerbate congestion at one of the country’s worst traffic bottlenecks,” the report stated.\n\n\n\nAnother $1.3 billion would go to Maryland’s proposed Montgomery County M-83 highway, which has been discussed since the 1960s.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe construction of this highway would “pose a a direct threat to 25 residential neighborhoods, 100 acres of public forest, 14 wetlands, six streams, natural floodplains and 60+ acres of agricultural reserve,” the authors contended.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWidening the I-205 in Oregon would cost $900 million and could endanger “the long-term financial security of the region’s transportation system,” while contradicting the state’s climate goals, according to the report.\n\n\n\nA proposed $750 million eight-mile bypass in southwestern Virginia would threaten hundreds of acres of forest, wetlands and farmlands, and force 21 households to relocate, the authors stated.\n\n\n\nAnother contentious project is the $510 million reconstruction of I-35 in Minnesota, which would be the first of a series of major highway projects in downtown Duluth, the report explained.\n\n\n\nThe final project of focus is the $66 million-$100 million redesign of the Erie Bayfront Parkway in Pennsylvania, which the authors argued would attract more traffic to Erie’s developing bayfront and fail to meet community demands for improved pedestrian access.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe authors recommended that instead of investing in such projects, state and local governments should finance solutions that minimize dependence on automobile travel.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey also stressed the importance of directing funding toward repairing existing roads and granting priority to projects that decrease growth in vehicle-miles traveled.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“State bureaucrats still have a misplaced appetite for costly, polluting and ineffective highway expansion projects,” Casale said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Rather than costly highway boondoggles, we need to start using our money more wisely by investing in public transit, walking and biking instead,” he added.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Photo by Quinn Harris/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The late-night/early-morning spot for Cubs fans asks you how you are feeling about the Cubs pitching staff.  Welcome back to BCB After Dark: the cool spot on a hot night for night owls, early-risers, new parents and Cubs fans abroad. I hope you’re all doing well tonight. Come on in and relax for a while. There’s no cover charge. Let us know if there’s anything we can do for you tonight. Bring your own beverage.\nBCB After Dark is the place for you to talk baseball, music, movies, or anything else you need to get off your chest, as long as it is within the rules of the site. The late-nighters are encouraged to get the party started, but everyone else is invited to join in as you wake up the next morning and into the afternoon.\nThe Cubs lost tonight to the Reds, 7-1. I blame myself for this one since it was 1-1 when I had to turn off the game and go deal with family matters. I should never have gotten married and had a daughter. Priorities.\nLast night I asked you to grade the Seiya Suzuki signing and it turns out most of you are still pretty happy with it as 50 percent of you gave it a “B.” Another 33 percent only gave it a “C” while 12 percent of you still think it was a home run and gave it an “A.” \nHere’s the part where I normally throw it over to the jazz and movies. But honestly, I had a bit of a scheduling problem this evening as my daughter’s high school football game (the one she’s cheering for) got delayed by two hours so as to avoid the 110 degree heat. Later, I had some internet issues. This is all a long-winded way of saying that I don’t have any movie stuff for you tonight. But I’d pre-written some jazz, and we always have time for that anyway. You can skip it now if you want. You won’t hurt my feelings. But I’m including some Rolling Stones as a bonus.\n\nToday (well, probably yesterday by the time you read this) is the birthday of the giant of the tenor saxophone, Sonny Rollins, who is 92 years young today. Or maybe we should call him the “Saxophone Colossus” as his classic 1956 album was titled.\nThis is a colorized concert recording from 1971. Sonny plays his classic “Sonnymoon for Two” and the jazz standard by Duke Ellington “In a Sentimental Mood.” Joining Rollins for this gig are Bobo Stenson on piano, Arild Andersen on bass and Jon Christensen on drums.\n\nAnd because it’s Rollins’ birthday, I’m including what is probably the song that is probably the very first time I heard Rollins play. It’s The Rolling Stones’ “Waiting for a Friend,” which features Rollins on saxophone. I always thought this was a surprisingly mature song for a band that, for the most part throughout their career, has refused to grow up.\n\n\nWelcome back to all of you who skip the music.\nTonight I’m going to ask you a simple question: How do you feel about the Cubs’ pitching staff going into 2023? The Cubs will have Marcus Stroman returning and we hope Kyle Hendricks will come back healthy. We don’t know about Drew Smyly, but it sounds like he could be coming back next year. There’s a mutual option on his contract, although we’re unsure on the terms. But he says he’s happy in Chicago. \n Then there are all those young pitchers that have done well this year. Keegan Thompson and Justin Steele are the most-established of them, but there is also Hayden Wesneski, Caleb Kilian and Javier Assad. It’s certainly possible, maybe even likely, that Jordan Wicks is going to pitch for the Cubs next season.\nThe bullpen is a bit more of a mess with team president Jed Hoyer trading away the best four relievers at the trade deadline. But there’s a good chance that Codi Heuer returns and Brandon Hughes is establishing himself as a reliable arm back there. There are also other young arms like Manuel Rodriguez, Brendon Little and Jeremiah Estrada. Adbert Alzolay is still a wildcard for either the rotation or the pen. And that’s not even getting into minor league prospects like DJ Herz or Ben Leeper or Ryan Jensen. \nThere are a lot of good and talented young arms. Of course, you know what they say about young arms—they’ll break your heart. \nSo rank how well you’re feeling about the Cubs pitching staff for 2023. A “5” doesn’t mean that you think they’re perfect the way they are, but you think what Hoyer needs to add to the team this winter won’t be too hard to turn it into a playoff-worthy staff. (This doesn’t mean you think the hitting will be good enough to make the postseason, of course.)  A “4” is you think there’s a solid foundation, but there are some pressing issues that need to be addressed and they won’t be easily solved. Give a “3” if you there’s a solid foundation, but there needs to be be a major renovation over the winter. \nA “1” means you think it’s a mess and the rebuild is still a ways away from completion. A “2” would mean that you are a little more optimistic that what they’ve got is good, but it still won’t be anywhere near playoff-ready, even with some big additions this winter.\nI hope I didn’t over-explain it. So tell us how you are feeling about the Cubs’ pitching staff heading into next year?\n\nThank you all so very much for stopping by. If you could help us by busing your own table tonight, that would be a big favor. Stay cool the rest of this evening. If you need us to call a ride for you, let us know. Please tip your waitstaff. And join us again tomorrow night for another edition of BCB After Dark.",

        "description": "Sadler’s Wells, LondonThe Belgian choreographer’s interpretation of the great keyboard work is a rich, carefully crafted essayAnne Teresa de Keersmaeker is not someone you expect to see dancing in silver sequined hotpants: a high queen of choreographic seriousness and an austere presence on stage. This solo is both a departure from and a distillation of what we know of the Belgian choreographer. Her 42 years of work has spanned starkly formal early pieces, shimmering group dances and sober solos, all wedded to the details of musical structures.In this case the music is Bach’s late masterpiece The Goldberg Variations, and it’s not really a solo, because her stage is shared with pianist Pavel Kolesnikov. In white vest, black shorts and bare feet, he sits with his back to the audience – he’s playing for her, not us – introducing the music’s theme with divine delicacy. Kolesnikov’s playing dances and sings as De Keersmaeker provides some profound listening experiences, standing still to let Bach breathe, even cutting the lights in mournful variation 25 to cocoon us in sound.

It appeared in this dimension in February 2017.\n\n\n\nThis theme is also special as I use it dog-fooding style (which I have been told is not always a culturally appropriate metaphor but it fits me) since I use it myself at (best doman ever, thanks Tim Owens):\n\n\n\nhttps://cog.dog/\n\n\n\nI checked to see if the original template had changed (I am relieved to find the answer is no), so no updates were needed there.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the only significant change I made was enabling the theme to use Font Awesome version 6.02, which is really as simple as downloading the web versions, updating the all.min.css styles and replacing the web fonts. I thought I would need to incorporate a few more bits of scripts and shims, but they did not seem to be needed.\n\n\n\nI also had been playing around with a plugin, Iconic Font Menus  I had maintained after the originators abandoned it that creates the social media icons. The original version was for Font-Awesome version 4 and I foolishly renamed my updated version with a 5 in it. I had found, in fact the plugin could work with later versions by referencing the CSS in a CDN, but since I already have Font-Awesome wired into the theme, I could save loading an unnecessary second font loading:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe real reason I wanted to do this is that this theme is one that Reclaim Hosting offers as a one click install. I sent them a note with the link to a new version that they could maybe update in their universe of web hosting (this way changes are pushed to all Reclaim users who used the one click installer of the theme).\n\n\n\nI got a replyleting me know they were pretty overloaded with semester start up for their clients, but I was offered the chance to DIY&#8211; take on modifying the Installatron Scripts that do this magic. I have been nosing around the copy Lauren Brumfield shared with me, but woah Nelly there&#8217;s a lot of moving parts\n\n\n\nAnd this is the simple part\n\n\n\nI made a first round of guesses but need more time to whack the code. The good thing is if I can figure out this simple one, I can update he SPLOT themes Reclaim offers and maybe even add new ones.\n\n\n\nThe other thing I did was followup on some GitHub renos I had done recently for TRU-Collector.  My README for even the simple WP-Dimension theme was rather sprawling, so I yanked out the docs to a separate markdown file which then affords me a way to display them more elenantly with Docsify This:\n\n\n\nMuch prettier and navigable documentation, generated dynamically from GitHub markdown.\n\n\nAnd maybe the best part of updating was a regular round of searching on a unique string in my theme footer to roundup like 15 new sites using the theme&#8211; the examples list is now 58 sites long. Some favorite new ones include:\n\n\n\nAlyssa V. Loera&nbsp;https://alyssavloera.com/Anne Cong-Huyen&nbsp;https://anitaconchita.org/Carolinas Regional Phi Alpha Theta Conference&nbsp;http://pat-2022.history.dhlbac.net/Casey W. Patterson&nbsp;http://caseywpatterson.com/Dr Derritt Mason&nbsp;https://derrittmason.com/Jonathan Mack&nbsp;https://jonathanmacklofi.com/Dr. Kari A. B. Chew&nbsp;https://ithana.org/Sam Holley-Kline&nbsp;https://samholleykline.com/Shyanne Michael&nbsp;http://shyannemichael.com/Stacey Greenwell&nbsp;https://staceygreenwell.createuky.net/Vert&#8217;altitude&nbsp;https://vertaltitude.org/Whale Racks&nbsp;http://www.whaleracks.com/\n\n\n\nAMany of these are for the idea I saw, as a person&#8217;s &#8220;calling card&#8221; but I see other uses like for products, conferences, etc. I see even students in the OpenETC picking it to write a series of blog posts.\n\n\n\nI love seeing these different dimensions of use (cough) (pun).\n\n\n\nThe other new dimension I am adding to my GitHub pile of stuff is enabling the Discussions area that provides a more human way than Issues for visitors to ask questions, make suggestions. Give it a spin for WP-Dimension, right now it&#8217;s a lonely space.\n\n\n\nThis is hardly ground breaking innovation, but it does feel good to get these updates in, and even more, to get some good feelings that this simple theme, which looks most &#8220;unbloggy&#8221; resonates for people. And I am still able to provide these and not bang anyone&#8217;s head on the Full Site Editing plaff.\n\n\n\nGive WP-Dimension a spin?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Image: \n\n\n\n\n\n2011/365/347 Believe in Fortune Cookies flickr photo by cogdogblog shared under a Creative Commons (BY) license",

        "description": "So-called copyright trolls come in all shapes and sizes and while most have a cynical approach to copyright law, some are prepared to go to extremes.\nThe most notable case in the United States involved Prenda Law. After playing the victim for years, an investigation found that the law firm uploaded movies to sites like The Pirate Bay and then sued those who downloaded them. Two lawyers were later sentenced to prison, one of them for 14 years.\nTaiwanese authorities are currently dealing with a similar case, with lawyers at the helm once again.\nLicensed &#8216;Copyright Cockroaches&#8217;\nEarly June 2022, news outlets in Taiwan reported that former ultramarathon runner, entrepreneur, political critic, and law graduate Kevin Lin was a suspect in a &#8220;copyright cockroach&#8221; case.\nAccording to a police investigation, Truth Intellectual Property Consulting Co &#8211; a company owned by Kevin Lin &#8211; obtained public transmission licenses which enabled it to distribute several films to the public. Movies covered by these licenses subsequently turned up on BitTorrent networks and people who downloaded them began receiving legal threats.\nAccording to reports, Lin&#8217;s company enticed users to download the torrents, tracked their IP addresses, and then filed copyright lawsuits in an effort to profit from cash settlements. Lin said that due to his support for the opposition government and his criticism of its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the investigation against him is politically motivated.\nFive Indicted For Running Copyright Troll Scheme\nThis morning Taipei prosecutors announced that Kevin Lin had been indicted for his role in the copyright-trolling operation. Since August 2021, hundreds of lawsuits had been filed against alleged movie downloaders by Lin&#8217;s company, prosecutors said, something that should attract a heavy sentence.\nIt&#8217;s alleged that Lin was admitted to the College of Law at National Chengchi University in 2018 and graduated two years later. From there he set up a copyright consultancy company with the goal of turning litigation against file-sharers into profit for his company.\nIn May 2021, licenses were obtained from Vie Vision Pictures Co. and Applause Entertainment Ltd, which led to 18 movies being uploaded to BitTorrent networks, to tempt users into downloading them. After capturing their IP addresses, Lin&#8217;s company obtained their identities from ISPs and sued them. The goal was to obtain out-of-court settlements.\nBig Crimes Deserve Heavy Sentences\nSince August 2021, Lin&#8217;s company filed 937 lawsuits for copyright infringement. In just 25 of those cases, the company managed to &#8220;extort&#8221; settlements of NT$900,000 (US$29,207), FocusTaiwan reports. In addition to Lin, several other people have also been indicted for their part in the operation.\nProsecutors are demanding heavy sentences for Lin and a lawyer identified by the surname Cheng, who played a key role in devising the litigation strategy. The company&#8217;s lawsuits overwhelmed the Intellectual Property Police Corps, other police agencies, and prosecutors&#8217; offices, authorities say.\nThree other men, identified by their surnames and alleged roles in the operation &#8211; Lin (lawyer), Hsu (company owner on paper), and Chen (employee) &#8211; have also been indicted. A third lawyer, an accountant, and a client of the lawyer are subjects of deferred prosecution.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

        "description": "As a woman of color who was fortunate to be accepted to medical school 29 years ago, I thought that if I had the intelligence, grit, and credentials, I would succeed. I thought that the profession of medicine operated within a system of meritocracy: work hard and you will be rewarded. I learned the hard way that it isn&#x2019;t like that.\nMy post-graduate professional journey has spanned a general surgery residency, fellowships in hospice and palliative medicine and clinical medical ethics, all of which has led me to a rare but much needed integrated clinical practice. But like the trajectories of so many other women and people of color, mine has been encumbered by factors beyond my control, like my gender and the color of my skin. I was aghast to learn that the skills I worked so hard to develop would later be used against me because I didn&#x2019;t look like a surgeon.Read the rest&hellip;",

Instead, we pretend it isn&#8217;t an issue and the problem persists.\r\nWe don&#8217;t talk about the ongoing and escalating costs (human and financial) of our changing climate, so the systems that are making it worse continue, unimpeded.\r\nWe don&#8217;t talk about all the time we waste in meetings, the persistence of caste and injustice, the manipulation of our communication platforms, the creeping aristocracy disguised as a meritocracy or even the ridiculous nature of the wedding-industrial complex.\r\nWhat all of these systems have in common is that they maintain their position in the status quo by creating a force field that somehow keeps us from talking about them.\r\nOn the other hand, we talk about quarterly profits, sports rankings, celebrities and the horserace of the day&#8217;s politics all the time. Which is why so much time and energy is spent on polishing and optimizing those systems.\r\nFigure out what&#8217;s important, then create the conditions for people to talk about it.\r\nPS thanks to Eileen Fisher for doing just that. Last month, their stores gave away thousands of copies of The Carbon Almanac to people who stopped by. Simply that. To encourage people to talk about our future.\r\nAlso congratulations to Gabe for 2,000 daily posts. Good stuff.\r\n\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&#160;",

After decades of being an outlier, it now joins every other developed nation in having the federal government engaged in negotiating drug pricing.\nThe pharmaceutical industry will continue its fight to blunt the implementation of the law, but in coming years Medicare prices for a limited number of high-cost medications will be lowered, with new prices established either through steep discounts off the average price in the private insurance market or by considerations of comparative effectiveness and other factors within a broader &#x201C;negotiation&#x201D; process.Read the rest&hellip;",

But a new watchdog report offers&#xA0;early evidence that only a small portion of providers are billing for virtual care in a potentially fraudulent way, suggesting that targeted interventions could crack down on abuse.\nSome Medicare-certified providers &#x2014; just about 1,714 out of 742,000 &#x2014; billed for telehealth in a way indicating high risk of fraud, waste or abuse during the pandemic&#x2019;s first year, according to the Department of Health and Human Services&#x2019; Office of the Inspector General&#x2019;s analysis of fee-for-service Medicare claims. Those providers billed roughly half a million Medicare beneficiaries for almost $130 million. The analysis doesn&#x2019;t account for the dollar amount of Medicare Advantage claims, but does include encounter data.Read the rest&hellip;",

        "description": "Photo by Joshua Bessex/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  When Judge might reach milestone homers; Donaldson to paternity list; Youth movement in bullpen; Severino eyeing Astros; Britton to Scranton FanGraphs | Ben Clemens: We’ve been tracking Aaron Judge’s homer pace compared to where some of the greatest single-season home run hitters were at various points late in the year, and with No. 55 yesterday, it’s looking all the more likely that the big guy breaks Roger Maris’ American League record of 61. Even the median FanGraphs Depth Charts projections had him reaching 62 prior to the start of play yesterday. So when might each of the milestone homers of 60-62 occur? Clemens took his best stab at it, using a few different factors and a million simulations. Spoiler alert: You might want to book a flight to Toronto.\nMLB.com: The Yankees made a few different roster moves before the beginning of the doubleheader on Wednesday. Some were already known (the already-maligned Ronald Guzmán up with Anthony Rizzo on the IL), but a new one involved Josh Donaldson heading to the paternity list — though manager Aaron Boone had alluded to that happening sometime soon. To make room for Guzmán, they designated Triple-A reliever Luke Bard for assignment.\nInterestingly, the Yankees called up a pitcher to take Donaldson’s spot, Deivi García. The former highly-regarded prospect has had another tough year, as he was demoted to Double-A Somerset and only recently returned to Scranton in a bullpen role. Per Boone, the Yankees just wanted an extra arm in the ‘pen for a few days since they already had a bevy of infielders. (Update: As it turns out, the extra arm was just for the doubleheader, as García was optioned afterward to likely make room for Nestor Cortes’ return today.)\nSI.com | Max Goodman: If it seems like there are a bunch of young pitchers throwing important innings in New York these days, said kiddos are aware. Ron Marinaccio, Greg Weissert, and Clarke Schmidt have all spent time at Triple-A this year, but now, all three of them are in The Show as part of what Schmidt has called “a youth movement.” His time in the rotation may be limited with Nestor Cortes set to return tomorrow, but he will likely join Marinaccio and Weissert in the ‘pen, where Weissert has already turned in some memorable moments and Marinaccio has boosted himself near the top of Boone’s pecking order. Their teammates and coaches talked with Goodman about how they’ve elevated their play.\nNJ.com | Randy Miller: It remains to be seen if the Yankees will make it far enough in October to square off with the Astros, but Luis Severino is already thinking about the possibility. He made perhaps his final rehab start yesterday with Double-A Somerset, and the Astros are on his mind. His team has faced the Astros in the playoffs thrice since he debuted in 2015, and they’ve been dispatched by Houston all three times. Sevy’s goal is to finish the season strong and finally take them out, who he called the AL’s “team to beat.”\n\nLastly, rehabbing reliever Zack Britton took another step in his comeback from Tommy John surgery, as he’s moved up to Triple-A Scranton, where he threw a scoreless inning last night. Boone has said that he’ll make multiple appearances there.\n\n\n  MLB REHAB ASSIGNMENT  The @Yankees announced that pitcher Zack Britton will join SWB against the @DurhamBulls tonight. Britton’s rehab assignment is being transferred from the @TampaTarpons, where he appeared in three games spanning 2.1 innings of work.#RepBX #OffTheRails pic.twitter.com/FMJdDkxihq— SWB RailRiders (@swbrailriders) September 7, 2022",

        "description": "Saudi Arabia has unveiled designs for a futuristic megastructure in the desert. But it is an idea that has preoccupied the imaginations of architects – and megalomaniacs – for generations‘The contemporary city needs a full redesign,” purrs a seductive voice, over surging orchestral strings. “What if we removed cars? What if we got rid of streets? What if everything you needed was always a five-minute walk away?” The words accompany an animation depicting an oblong megastructure sprouting from a desert landscape, slicing through sand dunes and mountains in a continuous urban strip: a city of 9 million people, sealed inside a mirror-clad box. “A 170km revolution in urban living,” the narrator continues, “protecting the Earth’s most stunning nature, while creating unmatched liveability.”Most cities don’t come with their own Hollywood-style trailers, but then most cities are not the Line. Unveiled in July, the project is the latest heady fantasy to emerge from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s marketing machine, garnering breathless headlines and torrents of clicks (its videos have 400m views and counting). The slick trailers promise a car-free, carbon-neutral bubble with its own temperate microclimate, where artificial intelligence will be “continuously learning predictive ways to make life easier”.

        "description": "Cynthia Hall-Duran of St. Paul has been a fan of the AZ Gallery (also called Argyle Zebra Gallery) in Lowertown for a while, and she was able to attend the soft opening of their September show “Rejected.”More than 2,200 artists, both emerging and professional, submitted their work to the State Fair’s Fine Arts show this year, and only 324 were on display. Plenty of quality work didn’t make the cut, and AZ’s “Rejected!” gives these photos, paintings and other works a second chance to be seen. Hall-Duran called the show delightful.AZ Gallery is open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. There’s an artist reception from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Friday. The show runs through Sept. 25.Art lover Florence Brammer of West St. Paul said she can’t stop telling people about the Weisman Art Museum’s fall exhibition, surveying three decades of art by Piotr Szyhalski. “We Are Working All The Time!” displays an impressive array of Szyhalski’s work, including posters, painting, web projects and public performance.Raised and trained in Poland, Szyhalski is a professor of design and media arts at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. Brammer singles out Szyhalski’s Labor Camp Report posters: a series of 225 hand-inked posters created daily over the course of eight months during the pandemic.“To see them all together, chronologically hung, is really stunning,” Brammer said.The show is open for public viewing now, but the gallery will host an opening bash on Sept. 15 at 7 p.m, its first such event since the pandemic hit. The exhibit will be on view at the gallery on the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities campus through Dec. 31.Installation view of Piotr Szyhalski: We Are Working All The Time!, at the Weisman Art Museum through Dec. 31, 2022.Courtesy of Weisman Art Museum.Teacher, theater director and artist Justin Spooner of Minneapolis is looking forward to attending Exposed Brick Theatre’s Through Our Eyes Festival that starts this weekend. The festival spans two weekends and features two new plays back-to-back. “Freeing Assata” by interdisciplinary healing artist Sterling Miller takes on the incarceration and liberation of political activist Assata Shakur. Siddeeqah Shabazz’s play, “A Love Story in 8 Scenes,” which explores the clash of love and religion for one teenage Muslim girl.Spooner appreciates that, in addition to showcasing two world premieres, the festival includes a series of short workshops, whose subjects include  Spontaneous Storytelling, Decolonizing the Artist, and Exploring Childhood through your Senses. The festival starts Friday Sept. 9 at 7:30 p.m. and runs through Sept. 18 at Open Eye Theatre in Minneapolis. ",

        "description": "Outside the wastewater treatment plant in the Iron Range town of Aurora, a small trailer could hold clues to solving a big environmental problem facing northern Minnesota — how to protect wild rice from sulfate, a pollutant released by iron ore mines, wastewater treatment plants and other industries. Mei Cai, an environmental engineer with the Natural Resources Research Institute at the University of Minnesota Duluth, points to a series of tanks where a chemical called barium chloride reacts with dissolved sulfate in the water to form particles.  Then another chemical is added that clumps those particles together into bigger pieces, forming a sludge that can be removed from the water, which then goes through a final filtration process.  The water that comes out of the Aurora treatment plant has high levels of sulfate; about 250 parts per million. The technology Cai is demonstrating in the mobile trailer has successfully reduced sulfate levels in the water from the plant to below 10 parts per million, low enough to meet the state&#x27;s strict sulfate rule for water that&#x27;s released into lakes and rivers where wild rice grows.That could be especially important here in Aurora, because treated water discharged from the city water plant eventually flows into the Partridge River, which was recently added by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to Minnesota’s list of waters that do not meet the state’s wild rice sulfate standard.“What we&#x27;re trying to deal with here is show that whatever is coming out of the plant, we can reduce the sulfate enough so that when the effluent from the plant goes into the environment, it doesn&#x27;t pose a significant impact on sulfate concentration in the region,” said Rolf Weberg, executive director of the Natural Resources Research Institute (NRRI). Natural Resources Research Institute executive director Rolf Weberg explains a new technology to remove sulfate from water on Aug. 15 in Aurora, Minn.Dan Kraker | MPR NewsGlobally UniqueMinnesota&#x27;s wild rice sulfate standard is globally unique — state lawmakers adopted it in the 1970s after research found that wild rice didn&#x27;t grow well in waters high in sulfate. But the standard has rarely been enforced. In 2011, following a lawsuit by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce to throw out the rule, and pressure from environmental groups and Indian tribes to start enforcing it, the state legislature asked the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to study the rule and see if it needed updating. The MPCA found that the rule wasn’t wrong, but said it was imprecise. So in 2017, the agency proposed a complex, flexible formula that would determine what standard would be appropriate for each specific lake or stream. But a judge nixed that proposal the following year. Chemicals added to water cause sulfate to form a red sludge that can be removed from the water for disposal.Dan Kraker | MPR NewsThat means the state’s wild rice standard of 10 parts per million remains in effect. “The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has basically said the MPCA has to apply the law. Period,” said Paula Maccabee, advocacy director with the group WaterLegacy. But for years, most mining companies and wastewater treatment plants have argued that the only proven technology to meet the standard — reverse osmosis, or nanofiltration — is prohibitively expensive. Only PolyMet Mining, which is seeking to open the state’s first copper-nickel mine, has agreed to install reverse osmosis technology to treat sulfate. &quot;You&#x27;re talking about capital costs in the range of hundreds of millions of dollars,” said Daniel Marx, an attorney who represents a group called the Minnesota Environmental Science and Economic Review Board, made up of municipal wastewater treatment facilities around the state. Marx said it would also cost water plants millions of dollars a year to operate and maintain the energy-intensive technology, and dispose of the salty byproduct that&#x27;s left over. &quot;It&#x27;s the type of situation where it&#x27;s not technologically or economically feasible to do sulfate treatment.&quot;That’s why NRRI has worked for the past several years to identify sulfate reduction technologies that are different from reverse osmosis, and that could work at a fraction of the cost, including technologies that use microbes and even peat. Marx said municipal utilities are excited about those new possibilities. But he said they have lots of questions — how much cheaper will alternatives be to reverse osmosis? And what can be done with the salty sludge that&#x27;s left over? Chemicals added to water cause sulfate to form a red sludge that can be removed from the water.Dan Kraker | MPR NewsJeff Hanson thinks he has an answer to that last question. He started a company called Clearwater BioLogic in his hometown of Babbitt on the Iron Range that developed a bioreactor designed to float in mine pit lakes and clean the water of sulfate.After years of research, he said his company recently devised a way to effectively treat the byproduct that&#x27;s left over. He’s partnered with a different company that has identified a beneficial use for what previously was a waste product. &quot;And having a value for that waste material, nothing to put in the landfill, nothing to throw away, dramatically improves the cost scenario on this as well,” Hanson said. Hanson hopes to have field trials in place on the Iron Range this summer. Paula Maccabee with the environmental group WaterLegacy said it makes sense to pursue new technologies to clean up old mining pollution. But she said state officials shouldn&#x27;t rely on them when deciding whether to grant permits to new projects. &quot;That is the biggest concern we have, is that if people start saying, &#x27;Well, maybe at some point in the future, we&#x27;ll be able to remediate it,&#x27; that might be an excuse for failing to use the technologies, whether it&#x27;s the liners or the nanofiltration that are necessary right now, to prevent more pollution.&quot;The city of Aurora pulls its drinking water from the St. James Mine Pit. Dan Kraker | MPR News‘Feet to the fire’Meanwhile the federal Environmental Protection Agency has made it clear to Minnesota officials that they need to address excessive sulfate in water. The question is how. “Right now there is a lot of uncertainty from our perspective about how MPCA will do that,” said Marx, who represents municipal water plants. One of the questions the group has is how the MPCA will choose to proceed “in light of its findings that there are issues with the current standard on the books that may be outdated,” said Marx.Hanson, who is developing the floating bioreactor technology in Babbitt, said addressing the sulfate issue is going to require that the state play a role. “We do need to hold [mining companies] feet to the fire sometimes,” Hanson said. “And that&#x27;s why we have agencies that set standards and enforce them.”MPCA spokesperson Darin Broton said the agency continues to have conversations with tribal nations, communities and industrial facilities on the sulfate issue. “There are no easy solutions or a one-size-fits-all approach,” Broton said. “But we’re hopeful that new technologies can help address some of the concerns.” And those technologies may not be that far away from being deployed. NRRI’s Weberg said the next step is to engage with water treatment plants to see what additional data they need, and to partner with a plant to build a pilot facility. He doesn’t think that future is that far away. “It could be a year or two away, but it&#x27;s certainly not 10 years away,” Weberg said. Mei Cai, an environmental engineer with the Natural Resources Research Institute, shows how a chemical added to water can solidify sulfate for removal.Dan Kraker | MPR News",

        "description": "Updated: 1:02 p.m.Ready to be inundated with political ads? Now that Labor Day is past, the commercials from candidates, parties and outside groups are ramping up. Even if you don’t watch TV, the campaigns are looking for every avenue to get your attention with Election Day now just two months away. From screens to the skies and many places in between, candidates are hoping their points sink in.“Voters aren&#x27;t paying attention necessarily during the summer,” said Erika Franklin Fowler, professor of government at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, who tracks political ads and trends across the country.  “And so it&#x27;s essentially when people are back to their normal routines in the fall, that&#x27;s really when candidates and campaigns are trying to make their final pitches as we head into November.”Campaign ads offer a prime window into what candidates and their allies view as the issues resonating most. Messages often mirror polling or what’s driving the news.Some big issues this year are education, inflation and abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade’s constitutional protections. Images of the upheaval after George Floyd’s killing by police will also get ample use.Ads from DFL Gov. Tim Walz highlight his efforts to boost school funding, which he contrasts with Republican candidate Scott Jensen’s comments questioning where education dollars go. Walz has also run commercials touting the state’s strong economy and the rebound from COVID-19.“We&#x27;ve been through a lot but we&#x27;re coming back strong. Now I&#x27;m fighting for more relief for families so we can keep moving forward as one Minnesota,” Walz says in an into-the-camera appeal that closes out his opening ad, complete with upbeat music and sunrise images.Gov. Tim Walz posed for a selfie with a supporter at the 2022 Minnesota State Fair.Brian Bakst | MPR NewsAds from the Alliance for a Better Minnesota are more searing. The pro-Walz group has run loads of commercials highlighting past Jensen comments favoring abortion restrictions.On Wednesday, Jensen aired his first TV ad. It features him holding his newborn grandchild and discussing abortion.“Abortion is divisive, and Tim Walz is weaponizing the issue,” Jensen says as the infant wiggles in his hands. “In Minnesota, it’s a protected constitutional right, and no governor can change that. And I’m not running to do that.”He closes by saying he wants to bring the focus back to public safety, education and inflation. But that he is talking about abortion in his opening ad demonstrates that the issue is exacting a political toll on his campaign.Jensen has gone from saying he’d support a full ban on abortion to laying out exceptions in cases of assault or when a mother’s life is at risk. Minnesota’s abortion-access protections are rooted in a state Supreme Court decision. To be sure, governors appoint justices when there are vacancies, but it would take a new legal challenge or constitutional amendment to completely reverse course. But lawmakers could seek to add new restrictions or licensure expectations for abortion providers.Republican candidate for governor Dr. Scott Jensen greets supporters at the 2022 Minnesota State Fair.Brian Bakst | MPR NewsThe political ad push will be difficult for viewers to escape if they’re watching standard television programs.Campaigns and outside groups are gobbling up time on everything from house remodeling shows on cable to prime-time network dramas to live sports. Political ads are routinely wedged around local newscasts because campaigns know they’re getting in front of a civically engaged audience.Generally speaking, the more watched a program is, the more campaigns want to piggyback. But that’s also pricey. One 30-second ad this weekend during the Minnesota Vikings game against the rival Green Bay Packers will set candidates back $35,000. It costs groups even more because candidates get a preferred rate.A &#x27;Walz Failed&#x27; campaign ad in a men&#x27;s bathroom at a restaurant in Woodbury, Minn.Brian Bakst | MPR NewsBut there are cheaper options. Walz is paying $24 for spots he’s airing on Hallmark Channel during “Golden Girls” reruns in the Mankato cable market.It’s all about when the ads run, how popular the show is and what the demographics are of the likely audience. But campaigns also want to be sure people are seeing their ads enough times to sink in — what the industry calls frequency or impressions.Walz has been on air since July and is now running hundreds of thousands of dollars in ads a week, with that increasing as the election grows closer. His allies are adding on.Jensen’s initial TV buy is smaller, but his campaign says he’ll have a robust presence on air. He’s likely to considerably lag Walz in overall ad spending.An independent candidate, Hugh McTavish, has also been airing television ads.Based on ad time reservations, there also will be ads in the attorney general race, likely the secretary of state race and cable spots in key legislative districts.  The main event among the U.S. House races is in the 2nd District, which is south and east of the Twin Cities. DFL Rep. Angie Craig and Republican challenger Tyler Kistner have millions of dollars in commercial time lined up, and several outside groups are ready to throw in millions more.And it won’t be only TV where the ads land.Captive audiences are key.Digital ads and banners follow you around the internet or social media based on browsing habits. Publicly available data on spending on digital text and video show Walz and his key allies far outpacing Jensen and his backers in that area, too.There was that ubiquitous &quot;Walz Failed&quot; plane banner hovering above the State Fair as well as hand-held fans and backpacks. A digital ad with the anti-Walz slogan flashes on screens above suburban restaurant urinals. Franklin Fowler, who directs the Wesleyan Media Project, said campaigns are adapting to changing entertainment and media consumption habits. “From a paid advertising perspective, television still garners the bulk of the campaign spending, in part because it&#x27;s expensive. But it&#x27;s certainly the case that fewer people are watching TV because of lots of cord cutting and other things,” she said. “And so as audiences gravitate to different spaces and get rid of their cable TV altogether, that means campaigns and those who are trying to reach voters do have to use more tools in order to reach folks.”APM Research Lab senior research analyst Ben Clary contributed to this report.",

        "description": "A live-action take on the classic animation has effective visual moments and an impactful turn from Tom Hanks but never quite justifies its existencePinocchio has long been a misfit within the classic Disney canon – the early animated films which solidified Walt Disney’s reputation as a master storyteller and formed the bedrock layer of American cinematic fairytales. You’re hard-pressed to find someone who claims the 1940 original, the second animated feature ever made by Disney, as their favorite. Many found it to be frightening and unsettling, myself included. It’s a weird story, this tale of a sentient wooden puppet who dreams of being a real boy and, among other things, witnesses rogue children transform into donkeys and gets swallowed by a whale.So it makes sense that the inevitable (for business reasons) live-action remake of Pinocchio will bypass theaters and head straight to Disney+. It is an odd fit, less hyped than its live-action cousins, neither quite a children’s movie nor a children’s movie for adults. There’s a strangeness to the whole proceeding – an unbeloved classic, sanded down from the original 1883 novel by Italian author Carlo Collodi, updated into a 1 hour, 40-minute visually stimulating but emotionally dull mishmash.

        "description": "The Republican Party on Thursday announced it has hosted more than 5,000 separate events at its minority community centers, 38 multipurpose voter outreach spaces spread around 19 states.\n\n\n\nThe Republican National Committee (RNC) community centers have been at the center of the party's outreach to minority and disadvantaged communities around the country ahead of the 2022 midterms.\n\n\n\n“The RNC's purposeful engagement forges the way for stronger relationships with minority communities and a stronger Republican Party. Unlike Democrats, Republicans do not take minority communities for granted, and we will continue to work to earn each vote ahead of November,\" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told The Hill in an email.\n\n\n\nEvents held at the community centers include everything from business roundtable discussions to food and toy drives, and educational or training events.\n\n\n\nThe centers also host the Republican Civics Initiative, an education program for immigrants who are eligible for naturalization.\n\n\n\nThe community center strategy seeks to engage minority voters directly with the Republican Party, in an attempt to cut into long-held Democratic electoral advantages among non-white voters.\n\n\n\nThe strategy also exploits a weakness in Democratic outreach to many minority communities, as criticism over that party's intermittent voter contact, particularly with Hispanic voters, has received significant attention.\n\n\n\nAnd the community centers are likely to serve as staging grounds for get-out-the-vote efforts in key districts.\n\n\n\nA majority of the GOP's community centers are set up to serve Black and Hispanic communities, but there are also five centers dedicated to Asian and Pacific American voters, one for Native American voters in North Carolina, a Jewish community center in Boca Raton, Fla. and a veterans' community center in Virginia Beach, Va.",

Boudette, an automotive correspondent for The New York Times.Background reading: Not only is California the largest auto market in the United States, but more than a dozen other states also typically follow California’s lead when setting their own auto emissions standards.Automakers such as General Motors have equally ambitious aspirations for electric cars, but moving away from internal-combustion vehicles will not be easy.For more information on today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily.

        "description": "A man’s encounter with the woman whose life he saved triggers this heartfelt tale of a search for home and meaningFrom his 2016 debut, Five Rivers Met on a Wooded Plain, prolific novelist and playwright Barney Norris has never been afraid to address the Big Stuff. The brevity of life; the fragility of love; the mysteries of memory and consciousness. Through an array of unnervingly convincing ventriloquised voices, he has excelled at pinpointing the pivotal moments in his characters’ emotional lives. His fourth book, Undercurrent, is equally engaged with universal themes, with a Hardyesque focus on chance, agency and grief.

        "description": "Volodymyr Zelensky may be the most accessible wartime president in human history. Since Russia invaded his country in February, Zelensky has masterfully paired his everyman charisma with his uncommon social-media savvy, making the whole world feel as though they know him—and inspiring millions of people to root for Ukraine’s victory.And yet actually getting to the man in person is not so easy. The Atlantic’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, and staff writer Anne Applebaum learned as much when they traveled to Kyiv in April to interview Zelensky, a journey that involved getting on a train without tickets and navigating the city long after curfew.Their wide-ranging conversation with Zelensky is a window into how he is living, what shapes his thinking, and what it looks like when an unlikely political figure like Zelensky goes “from Larry David to Winston Churchill” overnight, as Goldberg put it.Listen here:What follows is a condensed and lightly edited transcript of Goldberg and Applebaum describing their time in Kyiv, including portions of their conversion with Zelensky.Jeffrey Goldberg: You couldn’t think of a leadership style more different from that of Vladimir Putin than Zelensky’s. It’s almost too neat. If you’re writing a screenplay, you’d be like: “Oh, these guys, they’re two opposites. Give me a break.”Anne Applebaum: I’ve been writing and working on Ukraine for many, many years. And I always felt that it was a very minority interest. And to have it suddenly become a mass phenomenon has been really amazing. And I think probably that mass phenomenon is not possible without Zelensky.Goldberg: Anne Applebaum and I were meant to go to Ukraine what turned out to be two days before the invasion. So we postponed the trip, because there was an assumption at the very outset that Russia would just roll over Kyiv and that we would be stuck there and bad things would happen.And it just seemed like an odd moment to go, but we kept on planning. It’s just a matter of getting in. Because there are no flights, obviously. And so we took a very, very long train ride on a very, very slow-moving train.Applebaum: It wasn’t a train that you could buy tickets to. We got on the train because an old friend of mine works for Zelensky. He’s actually a Ukrainian journalist. He’s now got a job, both in the president’s office and also in the railway administration. And so, when we landed in Warsaw, Jeff said to me: “Do you have the tickets?” And I said: “No, Jeff, I don’t have any tickets because what happens is we get to the platform and we find the conductor. And we say, ‘Sergei sent us.’” And Jeff said: “You’re joking.” And I said: “Nope, I’m not joking.” And then we went to the platform and we found the conductor and I said, “Sergei sent us.” And he said: “Okay, here’s your car.”Goldberg: Much of the trip was at night across the Polish countryside. And in the middle of the night, you arrive at the border, there’s a Polish border check. Then the train moves a little bit and there’s a Ukrainian border check. The fascinating thing about trains that move between Poland and Ukraine is that the old Soviet Union made sure that its tracks were a different size than tracks moving to the west. Because, assuming that NATO was going to invade through Poland, the Soviets wanted to make sure that their trains couldn’t move. So what they have to do at the border is literally change the wheels.Applebaum: And this was meant to prevent, you know, Germans or whoever from riding their trains into the country. It’s funny in retrospect. It’s actually not funny in one sense, because one of the reasons why Ukraine now has trouble exporting its grain by road—historically, it’s always exported it through the ports, through the Black Sea—is because of this wheel problem, because it would take a long time and a lot of effort to move that kind of cargo by train.Goldberg: We arrived in the station. We were met by some people who were there to help us. The elegiac, beautiful, evocative thing was that there was a concert, a free concert taking place in the main hall of this train station: a balalaika orchestra with a couple of very big Ukrainian pop stars singing Ukrainian patriotic songs.One of the performers was Oleg Skrypka, who is among a group of musicians now seen as symbols of Ukraine’s resistance. It would be the equivalent of Taylor Swift showing up in Union Station to, you know, make the crowd feel like life was worth living or that we can have some normalcy.So we stood there and listened for a few minutes. It was quite moving. But the city is mostly empty. The streets are not filled with people. Some stores were operating, a couple of restaurants were operating, but we moved quickly to our hotel.Applebaum: There were soldiers manning roadblocks. There were these metal contraptions that the Russians call hedgehogs that were around many of the bridges and blocking some of the roads.I had been there in December, only three months earlier. And in December, it was a completely normal city. I remember there was an ice-skating rink set up outside the presidential administration. There were little children ice skating on the rink. So it had been absolutely normal. A couple of months into the war, it was very different.Goldberg: So the meeting was at night. We got there before curfew. You get to a checkpoint, and then you go through to another checkpoint. And they’re soldiers of different units. Some of them are very young. Some of them clearly had been soldiers for a month. You get into the presidential compound and it’s all blacked out.What happens is you have no sense of where you are in the building. It’s dark. You’re going down long, winding, circuitous hallways, making rights and lefts, upstairs and downstairs.Applebaum: I assume it’s a way of evading bombers or somehow protecting people inside. Eventually we arrived at a kind of secure room that’s in the center of the building, which had no windows, but had Ukrainian flags all around.And this was where we met Zelensky.Applebaum: We could hear him coming in with his chief of staff and one or two other people. And he was swearing as he was walking in.Goldberg: He walks in, he looks at us and he raises his hand shyly, like to wave, and says “Hi” in English. And we said: “Hi.”Applebaum: And then he made a joke about having an old back or something like this. And my first thought was: That’s so un-Putin-like. The first thing he was showing us was: I’m a normal person. I’m not pretending to be pompous. I’m not making you wait. I’m going to talk to you as if we were in a coffee shop, and I’m not going to act like I’m so important, and so on.It was a very different atmosphere than that created both by previous Ukrainian presidents—but also very, very different to the filmed meetings that we’ve seen people having with Vladimir Putin, where there’s a big, long table. And there are these very grand rooms and the guests are kept at arm’s length, and so on. This was not like that at all. This was very collegial.Goldberg: He’s very informal in his approach. You’re reminded that he actually is a comedian and entertainer. He’s not trying to intimidate with the size of his office, with his bearing, with his personality. He’s just Volodymyr Zelensky, this television comedian who wound up becoming the president of a country under siege.Applebaum: He’s not living some exceptional life. He’s not escaped to Monaco. He’s suffering the same things [his people] are and feeling what they feel. And I think it’s become very politically effective to do that. I mean, and you can even see it by what he’s wearing.Goldberg: He was wearing his typical green shirt and green semi-army pants.Applebaum: You can imagine a different Ukrainian president wearing a uniform. He’s the commander in chief; he might want to dress up in something with epaulets or even just camouflage. But mostly he’s wearing T-shirts. And I think this is the uniform of ordinary Ukrainians. It’s also more or less the uniform of the territorial army, which lots of Ukrainians are serving in. So he’s demonstrating all the time that he’s one of them. He’s like them. He feels what they feel. And the same message is being sent to the West.Goldberg: There is something incredible about this story in that he’s, like, some Jewish comedian who somehow ended up the president of Ukraine. And then Putin invaded. And somehow he had to figure out how to stop being a comedian and be a wartime leader. Be Churchill, you know. Moving from Larry David to Churchill.Applebaum: We talked about what weapons Ukrainians needed. This was of course one of the big themes of the interview, because it was really, in that particular moment, what they especially wanted to get across.And Zelensky describes calling world leaders. He says, well, you know, I speak to the—I don’t know—the chancellor of Austria and the president of Germany, and I call them every week. And every week, they say: “How can we help you?” “What do you need?”And he says, “Well, actually here’s a list. I need airplanes, howitzers, so on, and so on.” And then a week later, they call back again, and they say: “How can we help you? What do you need?” And he says, “Well, actually I told you last week, but here’s the list again.”Goldberg: He gets tired of all the same questions—and what he really gets tired of, he told us, was having to explain over and over and over again what weapon systems and what kind of support he needs.Applebaum: At that moment in April, it felt like there was still a pretty big gap between what the Ukrainians needed to defend themselves and what America in particular was able to supply. I think in the early part of the war, there were several things going on.One was that the Americans, first of all, didn’t believe the Ukrainians would last that long, that they would defend Kyiv. Second of all, there was some kind of lack of understanding between the two sides. Ukraine is not a traditional American ally. It’s not Israel. It’s not Britain. It’s not Australia. It’s not a country that we’ve been working with for decades [where] we have decades of understandings and treaties and joint military exercises that we can draw on.And so I think there was some lack of fellow feeling in the beginning. And some Americans weren’t sure, you know: Should we really send these things? Will they know how to use them? Will they lose them? What will happen? I mean, I’m guessing that that was what was going on. I don’t really know that. But there was some reluctance initially. There has also been, from the beginning, a reluctance on the part of the United States to give weapons that would seem to be very provocative to the Russians.Goldberg: The most interesting thing about his request for weapons was the subtext. The subtext was: If you want to defeat Russia, you’re going to have to give me this stuff. And if I don’t do it with your material, one day you’re going to have to do it yourselves. So you might as well have Ukrainians fight this fight.Applebaum: I find the appeal of Zelensky in America fascinating, because I think it comes from something quite specific. So for the last decade, maybe two decades, you know, Americans have been divided by a culture war. Which to be incredibly crude about it, is something like: liberal values on the one hand, versus nationalism or patriotism on the other.And what Zelensky has done is demonstrate what it’s like to do a national, patriotic defense of liberal values. He’s very much defending a free society, an open society, but also a multicultural society. He’s Jewish. People around him speak both Russian and Ukrainian. There are people of other faiths and nationalities in his entourage and in the Ukrainian leadership.And part of what they’re fighting to preserve is that definition of Ukraine as a form of civic patriotism. Ukrainian civic patriotism. And that’s one thing that I think—even if everybody doesn’t articulate it that way—I think that’s part of his appeal in the United States and in Europe.Goldberg: I surmised that he is, psychologically, a very healthy person. Because he’s been basically trapped in this complex. Every day brings new information about nightmares that are happening across this country. He can only deploy so many soldiers, and the army is only so effective. It can’t defend everything at once. He’s having endless Zoom conversations and phone conversations with people he has to repeat himself to. He doesn’t have his family near him for obvious security reasons. It’s a miserable life.And I got the feeling—and this is more of a vibe than an explicit conversation—but I have a feeling that he’s at peace with the fact that he’s a wartime leader. That he might never make it out of this place. But he’s not going to leave. And that somehow history has chosen him to be the leader and spokesman for his country. And so he’s just going to sit there and do the task. But he doesn’t get a lot of sleep. He doesn’t get a lot of rest. He doesn’t get any breaks.But he made the most important decision he probably has made in his life, at least as a public figure, by not running away in the first days. We all remember Ashraf Ghani: the president of Afghanistan who got the hell out of Dodge right as the Taliban was at the gates of Kabul. And Ashraf Ghani has to live with himself forever with that decision.And no matter what happens in the future, Zelensky should be remembered for his decision to stay. And stand with his people. And stand with his country. That was an act of supreme bravery. There were a lot of people in Europe and America telling him to get out. Obviously the CIA and other agencies had figured out ways to move him out of the country if they had to. And he stayed.Applebaum: We spent about an hour and a half with Zelensky, and then about an hour and a half with Andrii Yermak, his chief of staff. And so, by the time that was done, it was very late. The presidential administration building was totally empty, and we had the same scene as before, with people leading us out through the darkened stairways with flashlights.Goldberg: There was one street-cleaning vehicle going down the road, I remember, which is incongruous because it was the only vehicle and it was a street cleaner. Which shows that they’re still trying to maintain some level of order and safety and cleanliness. But it was very interesting to walk out into that kind of absolute quiet, absolute dark.And it made me think of Zelensky in his bunker, alone with his thoughts. Eventually, everybody has to go to sleep for at least a couple of hours. And then he sits there. And I wonder what that’s like, thinking: What will tomorrow bring?",

        "description": "“How to Build a Life” is a weekly column by Arthur Brooks, tackling questions of meaning and happiness. Click here to listen to his podcast series on all things happiness, How to Build a Happy Life.When empath first entered the English lexicon, it was anything but a compliment. The term was coined in a 1956 science-fiction story about unnaturally empathetic beings that are used to exploit workers. But the word has since taken on more positive connotations and today might even be worth putting on your résumé as a mark of leadership. Some argue that leaders should exhibit more empathy to help burned-out workers after the worst of COVID-19. The reporter Charlotte Alter dubbed Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign an “empathy offensive,” and if election results are any guide, the strategy paid off.In contemporary culture, empathy seems like a fairly unalloyed virtue. As virtues go, however, empathy is overrated. Used excessively and on its own, it can bring harm to empathizers and empathizees alike. Instead of striving to be more empathetic, we should all try to build on empathy to cultivate its superior cousin: compassion.Want to hear more from Arthur? Join him for coffee and conversation at The Atlantic Festival on Friday, September 23. Register and find out more here.Empathy is not feeling sorry for someone in physical or emotional pain—that’s sympathy. Rather, it is mentally putting yourself in the suffering person’s shoes to feel their pain. It’s the difference between “Get well soon” and “I can imagine how much discomfort you must be feeling right now.” Some researchers even hypothesize that empaths have hyper-responsive mirror neurons, which react when another person’s behavior is observed. In other words, taking on others’ burdens might be built into some people’s brains.Evidence suggests that empathy really can lessen other people’s burdens. Participants in a series of experiments documented in 2017 were found to experience significant physical pain relief when hearing someone else express empathy, but not when hearing comments that were unempathetic or neutral. Similarly, patients cope better with bad medical news if their doctors are empathetic, showing they personally understand what the patient is going through.But this relief comes at a cost to the empathetic person. Writing in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience in 2014, researchers showed that training people in empathy tended to raise their negative feelings in response to others’ distress. This makes sense: If you take on others’ pain, you will have more pain in your life.Empathy can also harm others—the objects of empathy and even those uninvolved. In his landmark book Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion, the University of Toronto psychologist Paul Bloom argues that empathy “can lead to irrational and unfair political decisions.” For example, policy makers might hold people to different standards because they connect to some personal challenges and trials but not others. Bloom even says empathy can “make us worse at being friends, parents, husbands, and wives,” because sometimes an act of love involves doing something that causes pain rather than relieving it, such as confronting an awful truth. The philosopher Jesse Prinz concurs, noting that when we focus on the feelings of one individual, we can ignore the greatest good, and might even do things that harm instead of help, such as “recklessly support[ing] social programs when toughness is called for.”[Read: The dark side of empathy]For empathy to become a full-fledged virtue requires adding a few complementary behaviors that convert it into compassion. A comprehensive study of compassion in the Clinical Psychology Review defines it as recognizing suffering, understanding it, and feeling empathy for the sufferer—but also tolerating the uncomfortable feelings they and the suffering person are experiencing, and, crucially, acting to alleviate the suffering.Compassion helps both the sufferer and the helper. In the 2014 study that showed that empathy training worsened mood, some participants were given training in compassion instead. Compared with empathy training, compassion training lowered their negative feelings and raised positive feelings after they witnessed the pain of others. Compassion also benefits the sufferer: For example, doctors who are more comfortable around patients in pain may be more successful navigating painful treatment, such as acupuncture. Learning to look analytically at others’ discomfort and providing help can take another person’s burden and make it into an opportunity for both of you to feel better.For your sake and others’, the trick is not to eradicate empathy; rather, it is to develop it into compassion. You can do so in two ways.1. Toughen up.To be tougher in the face of another’s pain doesn’t mean feeling it less. Rather, you should learn to feel the pain without being impaired to act. I learned this distinction from my son, who is a Marine. In boot camp, he faced rigors beyond anything he had ever experienced in his life, and he said he wanted to quit every single day, and often thought he would. Boot camp was followed over the next couple of years by many rounds of combat training, and finally, selection for a special unit in which nearly 90 percent of aspirants were eliminated. According to my son, this last experience was more awful than boot camp, but he never doubted whether he would finish, because he had learned how to function under extreme circumstances. Pain—never far away for a Marine—doesn’t much faze him anymore.Compassionate people are like my son at the end of his training: just as likely to feel pain as anyone else, but able to bear it and function. Empathetic doctors relieve pain with their empathy; compassionate doctors can also calmly operate on the patient. Empathetic parents suffer with their adult kids when they are struggling at college; compassionate parents can resist the urge to drive over and treat them like children.[Read: A short history of empathy]2. Don’t just feel—do.A lot of the time, when people are in pain, they resist an effective cure because it would temporarily be even more painful. A person might walk around for years with a trick knee because they can’t bear the thought of an operation and recovery (and research shows that people usually overestimate the pain of surgery). Similarly, people stay in toxic relationships because leaving seems too terrible to deal with.Empaths can’t help others commit to difficult resolutions, because their assistance stops at the victim’s feelings. But compassionate people, toughened up to act, can do hard things that the person suffering might not want or like—but that is for their good. Compassion can be tough love, giving honest counsel that is difficult to hear, saying goodbye to an employee who is not a suitable fit, or saying no to a disappointed child. This can start a virtuous cycle, in which the recipient of compassion gets a little more resilient and becomes better able to show compassion themselves.If cultivating compassion sounds daunting to you, you’re not alone. It might be partially outside of your control: Research has shown that compassion and empathy are to some degree genetic, and that we may be inherently drawn to people with these traits. However, plenty of evidence also shows that compassion can be learned. Techniques for doing so involve a combination of contemplative practices, loving-kindness meditation for oneself and others, and learning to not just receive another person’s pain but also give your joy and happiness to someone who’s suffering.Like anything else of great human merit, the key for turning empathy into compassion is to use your conscious faculties to push beyond your feelings. Do the work to become strong in the face of pain and you will benefit yourself and others. There is no label like empath for someone who has become especially compassionate, but you’ll know it when you achieve it, and others will too.​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

        "description": "That Donald Trump has acted recklessly and lawlessly, without empathy, as if he lives in a world devoid of moral rules, should surprise no one. Some of us warned back in the summer of 2016 that Trump was erratic, unstable, and temperamentally unfit for office. He had what I referred to then as a “personality disorder.” I believed then and I believe now that it is the most essential thing to understand about him. Trump in power couldn’t end well.Trump never found a way to escape the antisocial demons that haunt him. But here’s what turned a personal tragedy into a national calamity: He imprinted his moral pathologies, his will-to-power ethic, on the Republican Party. It is the most important political development of this century.The GOP once advertised itself as standing for family values and law and order, for moral ideals and integrity in political leaders. Such claims are now risible. The Republican Party rallied around Trump and has stuck with him every step of the way.Republican officials showed fealty to Trump despite his ceaseless lying and dehumanizing rhetoric, his misogyny and appeals to racism, his bullying and conspiracy theories. No matter the offense, Republicans always found a way to look the other way, to rationalize their support for him, to shift their focus to their progressive enemies. As Trump got worse, so did they.Republicans defended Trump after the release of the Access Hollywood tape and alleged hush-money payments to a porn star. They defended him when he obstructed justice to thwart the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and sided with Russia over U.S. intelligence during a press conference in Helsinki, Finland. They defended him after learning of his effort to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election. They defended him despite his effort to overturn the election by pressuring state officials to “find” votes and send fake electors, by wallpapering the country with lies, and by instigating a violent assault on the Capitol. The ex-president continues to peddle the Big Lie to this day, and any Republican who challenges it is targeted.[Read: Trump’s rejection of observable reality]Something malicious has occurred since Trump won the nomination in 2016. Six years ago, Republicans jettisoned their previous moral commitments in order to align themselves with the MAGA movement. Today, they have inverted them. Lawmakers, candidates, and those in the right-wing media ecosystem celebrate and imitate Trump’s nihilism, cynicism, and cruelty. What was once considered a bug is now a feature.This is the result of individuals’ and institutions’ accommodation of one moral transgression after another after another. With each moral compromise, the next one—a worse one—becomes easier to accept. Conduct that would have horrified Republicans in the past now causes them, at best, to shrug their shoulders; at worst, they delight in it.How does that change play out in our politics? Five years ago, leading Republicans were publicly critical of Trump’s statements following the white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Now consider that just a few weeks after far more ominous actions by Trump—inspiring and provoking an insurrection—House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy flew to Mar-a-Lago to grovel before Trump. Initially, Republicans accepted the need for a bipartisan commission to find out what had happened on January 6; since then, they have undermined every effort to uncover that day’s events and how central a role Trump played in them.The 2016 Republican platform said, “The next president must restore the public’s trust in law enforcement and civil order by first adhering to the rule of law itself.” Today, Republicans, in response to a lawful search of the home of a lawless ex-president, compare the FBI to the Gestapo and the Stasi. Trump himself, during a rally, referred to the FBI and the Department of Justice as “vicious monsters.” And no political party in living memory has done as much as the GOP to undermine civil order and the public’s trust in law enforcement, or to attack the rule of law.In hindsight, January 6, 2021, was a milestone along not just one path of radicalization, but two. Of course, it represented an unprecedented assault on democracy by the violent mob on Capitol Hill and the president who incited it. But it also represented what turned out to be the last moment when Republicans considered repudiating Trump. For a few days, party leaders seemed, at last, horrified enough to break with him. But when McCarthy slunk to Mar-a-Lago, hat and apology in hand, and when then–Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Senate Republicans backed away from Trump’s impeachment and removal, the moment was over, and a door slammed shut. There would be no more wavering. Today, the dominant faction in the GOP is not conservative in the American tradition; it is authoritarian and revolutionary, like far-right parties in Europe.Karen Stenner, a political psychologist and the author of the groundbreaking The Authoritarian Dynamic, argues that about a third of people across 29 liberal democracies seem to have a psychological predisposition toward authoritarianism. The tendency exists on both ends of the political spectrum, though it’s more prevalent on the right.Stenner defines authoritarianism, which she believes is about 50 percent heritable, as a deep-seated psychological predisposition to demand obedience and conformity—what she calls “oneness and sameness”—over freedom and diversity. Authoritarians have an aversion to complexity and diversity. They tend to be intolerant on matters of race, politics, and morals; to glorify the in-group and denigrate the out-group; and to “reward or punish others according to their conformity to this ‘normative order.’”The danger, Stenner says, arises when that tendency, which is often latent, is activated by “normative threats,” a deep fear of change, and a loss of trust in our institutions. She also made this point to my colleague Helen Lewis: In normal, reassuring, and comforting conditions, people with authoritarian tendencies could be your best neighbor. But those predispositions “are activated under conditions of threat and produce greater intolerance to differences.”Donald Trump has made his supporters feel “permanently panicked,” according to Stenner. He “never got past the constant-rage-and-fear stage.”  And it doesn’t help that modern life’s complexity is overwhelming for many people.For those with authoritarian tendencies, Stenner says, there’s a need “to reassure them and calm them down.” Her goal is “to help authoritarians live in peace with liberal democracy.” We need to reintegrate, rather than triumph over and banish, the authoritarians. Demeaning and dismissing a significant part of the country won’t turn out well. And so the focus of her work is to find practical ways to bring “activated authoritarians” back from the brink, including by means of normatively reassuring messages. The key, she believes, is to reduce the feelings of being threatened and to find the right language—language that is less alienating to those with authoritarian tendencies—to talk about things such as diversity and immigration. She and the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt point out that moral elevation, the response we have when we witness virtuous acts, can also be helpful.This approach is commendable; my guess is that right now it might have sway with the minority of Republicans who are uneasy about Trump. Perhaps, combined with an indictment of Trump, it might be enough to weaken the ex-president to the point where the Republican Party breaks with him. But will its members break with the authoritarian tendencies that now define the GOP?That seems unlikely. The majority of the party has gotten more radicalized, more aggressive, and more conspiracy-minded, not less, since Trump left office. The MAGA movement has provided many of its adherents with an identity, a source of personal meaning, and a cause for which to fight. They have created a narrative in which they are heroic figures fighting malevolent forces. They find psychological satisfaction in relentless conflict; their lives seem more vivid and more purposeful within MAGA’s ever-combative frame. Politics has become, for them, an ersatz religion. In this activated state, they are not reachable by reason or open to amelioration. In fact, many in MAGA world are looking for reasons to take offense, to feel victimized, to lash out.[Peter Wehner: Don’t succumb to MAGA fatalism]There is an analogy to nature: When a thunderstorm cloud has sufficient electrostatic charge, it has to discharge toward the ground. If the lightning bolt doesn’t find one target, it will find another. So will Trump supporters.“We have a big faction of one of our two major political parties who wants to unravel our democracy because it no longer serves them,” Barbara Walter, a professor at UC San Diego and the author of How Civil Wars Start and How to Stop Them, recently told CNN. “The reality is if you don’t say anything, if you stick your head in the ground, this makes it easier for those who do want to create some sort of authoritarian or strongman, minority-rule government—sort of what you have in Hungary—it simply allows them to do that more easily. They can do it quietly behind the scenes when no one’s looking.”  I’m of two minds about all this. I admire groups such as Braver Angels, which is attempting to bridge partisan divides, decrease affective polarization, and help Americans understand one another beyond stereotypes. If we can help those with authoritarian tendencies reintegrate themselves into liberal democracy, we should certainly do so. It’s important to hear perspectives that differ from our own. And it’s imperative that we relearn how to talk with one another as fellow citizens instead of as combatants.I also believe we should continue to stay in relationships whenever possible, including with family members and friends whose authoritarian attitudes have been activated, even as we look for the right moment and the right way to name our differences and express our disappointment with those who have aligned themselves with malignant political figures and movements. We should speak with candor but not with malice, striving for grace as well as for truth. It’s an impossible balance to always achieve, at least for me; my frustrations can sometimes get the better of me, and perhaps they get the better of you too. But the balance is still worth fighting for.But even though we shouldn’t give up on individuals, I can’t escape concluding that the time for mollifying grievances is over. In our political endeavors, the task is now to contain and defeat the MAGA movement, shifting away from a model of psychological amelioration and toward a model of political confrontation. This is the model that Liz Cheney embraces, and so do I.[Mark Leibovich: Liz Cheney, the Republican from the state of reality]It requires defeating Trump Republicans at the polls, but it goes well beyond that. It also means rallying the forces that must rise up to oppose authoritarianism by speaking honestly about the nature of the threat. It means telling the truth about not just Trump but many of his supporters, who remain complicit in a corrupt and corrupting enterprise—one that is inflicting grave injury on our nation and its ideals.MAGA supporters have had countless opportunities to take the exit ramp, and they have always found reasons not to. At some point, when an enterprise is thoroughly corrupt, staying a part of it, helping it along, refusing to ever speak up, is not just a mistake in judgment; it is a failure of intellectual and moral integrity. This doesn’t mean that every area of a MAGA supporter’s life is devoid of rectitude, of course. But it does mean that one important area is. And that needs to be said.So, no, I am not suggesting “giving up” on individual MAGA supporters, writing them off, throwing them out of polite society—even if I were in a position to do any of those things, which I’m not. I am suggesting that much of MAGA world is authoritarian, that Liz Cheney is right to turn all her political energies to opposing it, and that containing and defeating MAGA—not hoping it will change, not placating its grievances—is now the No. 1 priority for friends of democracy. Maybe we’ll succeed, maybe we’ll fail, but the mission is unavoidable. And honorable.",

        "description": "In February, when the bombs began falling on Kyiv, I immediately thought of Sergii Leshchenko. He isn’t a friend or colleague exactly, but I feel indebted to him. Over the years, at a series of Kyiv cafés, he has patiently explained the dark corners of Ukrainian politics to me, sharing insights gleaned from his long career as an investigative reporter. In those earliest hours of the war, as I watched CNN correspondents crouching in the parking garages of their hotels, I worried about what might befall him. I sent him a text extending my “solidarity and prayers,” a gesture that, even as I made it, felt inadequate to the moment.I had first met Leshchenko in May 2014, in the back room of a sleek Kyiv restaurant serving food from the republic of Georgia. A group of journalists, both local and foreign, had assembled, and the mood was ebullient. Three months earlier, a revolution had chased President Viktor Yanukovych, a Russian-backed kleptocrat, from power.Leshchenko seemed young then: wiry, bespectacled, clad in a button-down shirt, a quiet presence. He had been something of a prodigy; the son of engineers, he had obtained his first press pass when he was 17. In the early years of independence from the Soviet Union, he roamed the corridors of Parliament, gawking at the new titans of the nation’s politics.He didn’t set out to be an investigative journalist. The vocation was thrust upon him. In 2000, two weeks after he began working for a newspaper, his editor went missing. Two months later, the editor’s corpse was discovered in the forest, decapitated, drenched with chemicals, and charred. Investigating the murder, which was never officially solved but strongly implicated a former president, provided Leshchenko with an advanced education in the hideous tactics of the powerful.Revealing the corruption of the elite was dangerous but also exhilarating. Perhaps Leshchenko’s greatest subject was Yanukovych’s extravagant lifestyle, especially his ornate palace, built on 340 illegally obtained acres. Among the amenities were a museum for the president’s car collection and a pirate ship anchored in a river that passed through the property. Leshchenko’s stories helped stoke the anger that brought protesters into the streets.On the night I met him, however, Leshchenko was contemplating a new career. His small circle of reformers shared a growing belief that the moment demanded more than just railing against the rot. Ukraine’s democracy needed builders. With the encouragement of the political theorist Francis Fukuyama, Leshchenko ran for Parliament and won. At age 34, he occupied one of the seats of power that had so dazzled his teenage self.It never occurred to me that I would see Leshchenko again. Then, in 2016, he made a brief but consequential cameo in American politics. Soon after Donald Trump won the Republican nomination, Leshchenko held a press conference in Kyiv. Waving a sheaf of documents, he revealed the existence of a “black ledger,” which contained notations of furtive payments disbursed by Yanukovych’s party. A few months later, The New York Times reported the presence of Trump’s campaign chair, Paul Manafort, in the pages of the ledger. He had apparently received millions in illicit payments from powerful backers of the party. Manafort immediately resigned from the campaign.I emailed Leshchenko asking if we could meet. On my subsequent reporting trips to Kyiv, I came to appreciate how his capacity for outrage coexisted with a sly sense of humor. He once showed me selfies he’d taken in front of properties that Manafort owned in New York.[From the March 2018 issue: Franklin Foer on Paul Manafort, American hustler]It took a sense of humor to appreciate the strange fate of his political career. In 2019, he had grown close to Volodymyr Zelensky, then a comic actor running for president. But the bylaws of Zelensky’s newly formed party forbade Leshchenko from running as a candidate on its slate. Only outsiders, who’d never held political office, were allowed to represent the party, which promised sweeping change. The outsiders won in a wave election, taking down their ally Leshchenko in the process.Leshchenko filled the void with a medley of projects. He hosted a television talk show and consulted at the Kyiv Post. Emulating the nation’s new president, he even dabbled in show business.Want to hear more from Franklin Foer about Russia’s war on Ukraine? Join him, Anne Applebaum, and George Packer at The Atlantic Festival on Friday, September 23. Register and find out more here.Brian Keith Etheridge, a writer from Hollywood, had spent months living in Ukraine so that he could be closer to the source material for what he hoped would be his masterwork. Little in Etheridge’s past suggested the depth and sweep of the project. His previous credits included sitcoms such as The Goldbergs and Mike &amp; Molly.This series would be darker, more award-worthy—a docudrama about Ukraine’s tumultuous post-Communist years. He told me he had the project distilled to a formula that might catch the attention of a Netflix executive: “It’s Narcos meets House of Cards, but set in Kyiv.” The working title was Sovereign State.Etheridge turned to Leshchenko for help. He was learning the history as he wrote; Leshchenko had lived the plot points.Etheridge asked him to apply the precision of investigative journalism to the script. In one draft, a powerful oligarch tells the Ukrainian president, “Suck my dick.” Leshchenko protested that he wouldn’t use that particular turn of phrase, because its recipient would interpret it as a slur and therefore grounds for violent reprisal.On February 23, Leshchenko and Etheridge were story-boarding episodes. “It was our best day of work,” Etheridge told me. But at 3 p.m., they were interrupted.A member of Parliament Etheridge had befriended arrived in the writers’ room. He looked pale. He had just met with Zelensky. The president told him that the Russians were going to begin bombing Kyiv the next morning. The subject of their show—the history of Ukraine—was about to take another momentous turn.Etheridge made hasty plans to drive to Lviv, in western Ukraine, a safe distance from the amassed Russian troops, and implored his partner to join him. Like me, he worried about Leshchenko’s safety in what promised to be a short, lopsided war. But Leshchenko sensed an opportunity to participate in the next chapter of Ukraine’s history. “I’ve got to be here,” he told Etheridge.In “Radio Atlantic,” Jeffrey Goldberg and Anne Applebaum report on their journey to Kyiv to meet with Ukraine’s president:Listen and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | Google | Pocket CastsJust before 5 o’clock the next morning, Leshchenko turned over in his bed and saw the ominous glow of breaking news on his phone. President Vladimir Putin had announced that Russia was launching its invasion of Ukraine.Soon after, he heard a distant rumble. He went outside and watched cars flow from garages, clotting the city’s arteries. His neighbors were fleeing westward to safer ground—but he had orders to go elsewhere.When Zelensky had taken office, he’d appointed Leshchenko to the Supervisory Board of the Ukrzaliznytsia, the national railway. Some members of the intelligentsia dismissed the job as a second-rate sop to a loyalist. But the prospect of working with the gritty stuff of locomotives fired Leshchenko’s imagination. He would help oversee one of Europe’s largest firms, with 230,000 workers, an organization that needed hardheaded reform. “I liked that it was concrete,” he told me this summer, over dinner at the restaurant in my hotel.I had returned to Kyiv, once again seeking Leshchenko’s insight. I wanted to see the war through his eyes, to understand how the country had survived the Russian onslaught—and whether the war had changed the trajectory of Ukraine’s still nascent democracy. He has a nose for a story and a knack for inserting himself into pivotal events. He’s also a raconteur, and good company.In the weeks leading up to the invasion, Leshchenko told me, Ukrzaliznytsia had sent specific instructions: At the first sign of war, he was to report to the organization’s headquarters, in central Kyiv. The building was a short subway ride from his apartment. Rushing out the door, he instinctively stuffed his backpack with his official documents, a wad of cash, his laptop, and underwear.The railway management had good reason to worry that the Russians would seek its destruction. Taking out the leadership of the railway would debilitate the nation’s primary transportation network and, therefore, the entire country.When Leshchenko arrived at headquarters, a functionary told him that the plans were already scrambled. He needed to head to a satellite office nearby, a building unlikely to make the Russian list of targets. With explosions in the distance, the CEO of the railway, Alexander Kamyshin, delivered a locker-room talk to the small group of executives who had assembled at the new rendezvous point. “We’re going to keep the railways operating at any cost,” he said.To hedge its bets, the group split in two and fled in different directions. One team made its way to Lviv, where it would set up an improvised headquarters.Leshchenko joined the second group, which included Kamyshin. They piled onto a specially designed railcar, called an automotrice. From a distance, it looked like a souped-up terminal shuttle from an American airport: With engineer’s perches at both ends, it could quickly change directions. Kamyshin announced that the car would ride the rails of central Ukraine in a deliberately desultory pattern, making it a slippery target.The group in the automotrice intended to run the system while on the move, but that proved impossible. In the early hours of the war, mobile phones worked erratically, if at all. To stay in touch with station managers at remote outposts, they relied on a communication system that might have been cutting edge in the Soviet era: Every hour or so, the car would pull into a station. Leshchenko and the executives would head into a room called the studio, equipped with a microphone. A switchboard operator would use a system of cables to patch them through to far-flung stations.What Leshchenko heard in these conversations gobsmacked him. At 8 a.m., a station manager on the border with Crimea reported that he had witnessed a train carrying dozens of tanks roll into Ukraine. Another manager relayed that he’d just seen Russian tanks a two-hour car ride from Kyiv. “We had people at even tiny stations,” Leshchenko told me. “We heard what nobody had known before.”Conventional wisdom held that if Russia attacked, it would merely escalate the long-standing conflict in the country’s east. But Leshchenko could see, from the strangely panoramic vantage of the automotrice, that the Russians were pouring into the country from every conceivable angle. “We understood the total invasion,” he said.Leshchenko became the railway’s de facto intelligence liaison. As a former journalist, he could take accurate notes of phone calls, and typed up the accounts of the disparate station managers on his MacBook. Each time he collected fresh information about Russian movements, he forwarded his notes to Serhii Shaptala, the army’s chief of staff.The group on the automotrice felt torn between conflicting imperatives. Conductors were scrambling to facilitate a massive evacuation of panicked women and children from besieged cities. Two thousand passengers, sometimes more, were crammed into trains designed to carry 600. But the rails were also being exploited by the invading Russians, allowing them to quickly import heavy weaponry deep into the country.To stall the onslaught, the Ukrainian army began deliberately detonating tracks that might carry Russian tanks into the heartland. Explosives ripped bridges from their moorings. These were significant alterations to the system that needed to be relayed down the hierarchy to station managers and engineers. From the mobile headquarters, the railway management remade the network’s map so that evacuations could continue, despite all the self-inflicted damage.As the automotrice caromed from station to station and the hours wore on, Leshchenko began to regret that he’d forgotten to pack his toothbrush. He managed to briefly cadge a bed in the car’s small bunk room, where the executives took turns napping.\r\n\r\nKyiv-Pasazhyrskyi train station, February 25. By June, Ukrainian trains had evacuated more than 3.8 million refugees. (Sipa USA / Alamy)\r\nAt the end of the war’s second day, just after midnight, the automotrice pulled into a small town. To avoid advertising targets to the Russians, everything remained shrouded in the thickest darkness. “I’m in a World War II movie,” Leshchenko thought. The automotrice slowed to a halt alongside another railcar. Standing on the tracks, he saw Ukraine’s infrastructure minister.Thank you for your good work, the minister told the assembled officials. But it’s time to consolidate operations in Lviv immediately. Before the invasion, the railroad was hardly beloved. It was notorious for its corruption and unreliability. But in those first days of war, when nearly every institution collapsed, the trains miraculously kept running. By June, Ukrzaliznytsia had evacuated more than 3.8 million refugees, including 1 million children. Every day, the company hauled an estimated 300,000 tons of cargo, compensating for the Russian blockade of Black Sea ports and a fuel shortage that incapacitated trucking.That night, as management followed the infrastructure minister’s orders and began the trip to Lviv, Leshchenko’s mind began to wander. He felt that the railway had survived its greatest moment of crisis. His nose for the story told him that history was going to be made elsewhere.On the eve of Zelensky’s inauguration, in 2019, Leshchenko believed he was going to join the president’s inner circle. During the campaign, he had arranged briefings for the candidate, lining up experts to teach him the intricacies of foreign policy and the necessity of battling corruption. After the election, Leshchenko discovered that Zelensky would answer his texts if he sent them in the early morning, as the president-elect prepared his kids for school. He began sending Zelensky advice, without having to filter it through a gatekeeper.Then, just as he stood poised to assume a position of power, his investigations of Paul Manafort returned to damage him. In May 2019, Rudy Giuliani appeared on Fox News and warned that Zelensky was “surrounded by literally enemies of the president.” Giuliani assured viewers that he wasn’t insinuating a vague conspiracy; he was pointing the finger at a specific adviser. “I’ll give you his name.” He paused. “A gentleman by the name of Leshchenko.”Giuliani’s denunciation was transparently part of his ploy to pressure Zelensky into launching an investigation into the Ukrainian business dealings of Joe Biden’s son Hunter. But Leshchenko knew it would ruin his chance for a job. Even if Zelensky largely resisted Giuliani’s importuning, he wasn’t going to risk angering the leader of Ukraine’s most powerful ally. “I’m not stupid,” Leshchenko said. “If you’re considered a troublemaker by an American president, it’s best not to be involved.”[Read: Franklin Foer on the betrayal of Volodymyr Zelensky]Now, with Ukraine at war—and Trump out of office—the landscape shifted. Three days before the invasion, Andriy Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff, had unexpectedly called Leshchenko to ask him to join the government’s Disinformation Prevention Center, an agency focused on combatting Russian propaganda.It was an aborted conversation. They made vague plans to meet and discuss the details further. Having arrived in Lviv after his time on the automotrice, Leshchenko called to press the issue. “Do you still need me?”“Take the next train back to Kyiv,” Yermak told him.At 7 o’clock the following morning, Leshchenko arrived in Kyiv and called Yermak again.“I’m here,” he told him.“A car will pick you up at your apartment in an hour.”Leshchenko stuffed his toothbrush in his bag and replenished his cache of T-shirts.The streets of Kyiv were devoid of civilian life, but the trip to the presidential bunker required wending through a maze of checkpoints. Anxious guards scrutinized documents passed to them through the car’s window. Days earlier, Russian agents, some of whom had supposedly laid low in Kyiv for months, had been activated. They’d descended on the center of power to capture, or perhaps eliminate, the leadership of Ukraine. The plots had been foiled, but anxiety remained.[Read: Anne Applebaum and Jeffrey Goldberg interview Volodymyr Zelensky: The worst may be ahead of us]When Leshchenko finally arrived at the presidential bunker, he found slumbering soldiers strewn across the floors. Presidential aides sidestepped them as they went about their jobs. Leshchenko, however, was shown to his own room—an office that doubled as a dorm. He could unfold a cot and place his pair of white hotel slippers next to it.Although Leshchenko had a room, he didn’t have a clear set of responsibilities, at least not at first. Needing to improvise his job into existence, he set about making himself useful. Unlike most members of the president’s inner circle, he spoke English well and without self-consciousness. From his days at the center of the Manafort scandal, foreign journalists had his number stored in their contacts. If he needed to play the role of gofer—helping arrange Zelensky’s interviews—he didn’t mind.Despite all the tension of the bunker, its ethos felt familiar to him. When Leshchenko had first met Zelensky, he’d noticed that he shared his office with a pair of brothers, Boris and Serhiy Shefir. They were longtime producers in Zelensky’s entertainment empire, like-minded comedic talents. Zelensky fed off their jokes. He liked to stay close to the creative process. Even after he left entertainment for politics, his inner circle still had the informality and bonhomie of a writers’ room.Somehow, the windowless bunker retained the same camaraderie. Most public figures would scoff at living with their closest aides, but it suited Zelensky. “We lived like a family,” Leshchenko told me. As he observed the president at close distance, it struck him: “He doesn’t like to be alone.” Zelensky’s extroversion propelled him to talk through every decision. “He liked to be able to see the reaction to his ideas.” The close company of his advisers allowed him to socialize the burden of running a nation at war.When Leshchenko went to the bunker’s canteen or stuck his head into a colleague’s office, he would often bump into the president, who would quiz him: “What’s the news?” When an adviser expressed his horror at a video of wartime destruction—or discovered a hilarious meme—Zelensky would crowd around a laptop along with everyone else.Zelensky let his generals manage the war, which felt far beyond his own capacities. But there was another war, the one for hearts and minds, which the president made his own. Leshchenko became one of his foot soldiers.Zelensky and Yermak (himself a film producer) fervently believed in the ability of celebrities to influence opinion and had impeccable instincts for casting. Part of Leshchenko’s job was to book talent that could bring international attention to Ukraine’s plight. Through his partnership with Brian Keith Etheridge, Leshchenko arranged for Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher to join a videoconference with Zelensky, though he failed in his campaign to get the president a virtual cameo at the Academy Awards. Zelensky settled for the Grammys.Since he was a young reporter, Leshchenko had stayed in touch with Michael McFaul. A longtime Russia expert and ambassador to Moscow under Barack Obama, McFaul was a fiery presence on Twitter and television, passionately advocating for the Ukrainian cause. When McFaul was going to address more than 200 Democratic members of Congress at a retreat in Philadelphia on March 10, he set up time to talk with Leshchenko and Yermak.Ninety minutes before he was scheduled to speak, McFaul dialed the men on Skype and was jolted by the presence of another face on the screen. There was Volodymyr Zelensky, smiling at him. “Mike, you look great over there,” the Ukrainian president told him. Zelensky needed House Democrats to fund arms packages for Ukraine and to pass more sanctions on Russia—and he needed McFaul to press that case.“Did he rile me up? Absolutely. Was it orchestrated? Absolutely,” McFaul told me. Even in the moment, he marveled at the expert manipulation.In our conversations, Leshchenko referred to the bunker by a euphemism, “The Special Place.” The term betrayed his emotional attachment to the months he spent living there. He felt connected to the patriotic mission, but he also admitted that the experience had fulfilled a yearning to “touch history with my fingertips.” What made the Special Place so special was that he was running his hand along a moment that would live in national legend.On March 19, Leshchenko left the Special Place for a few hours to grab a drink at a bar with the handful of his friends who’d remained in Kyiv. In his social circle, these friends were outliers. They hadn’t decamped to Poland, but had chosen to endure the empty grocery shelves and the blaring air-raid sirens.A DJ spun vinyl while hipsters in beanies downed shots in the name of victory; in the kitchen, volunteers were cooking meals for the Territorial Defense Forces. A devotee of underground techno clubs, Leshchenko felt transported back to his old haunts. Under different circumstances, the gathering would have spilled into the morning hours. But the government had imposed an 8 o’clock curfew, which meant the group needed to disperse at 7 so that nobody would be marooned on the streets on the wrong side of the deadline.As the gathering wrapped up, Leshchenko felt overcome by the moment, or perhaps it was the pair of Aperol spritzes he’d imbibed. His friend Anton Ptushkin, a YouTuber with a popular channel devoted to his international travels, had brought a camera. He grabbed Leshchenko and asked him, “What’s your attitude towards parties during the war?” In his mushy, slightly buzzed mood, Leshchenko exclaimed: “We have to come back to normality as much as possible; if we don’t come back to normality, people won’t come back to Kyiv. If they don’t come back to Kyiv, they won’t pay taxes; they won’t buy milk or bread in the store; the economy won’t come back to life. War is not for death; it’s for life.”Two weeks later, Ptushkin posted the video, which had been shot at the very moment that Ukrainian troops were fighting a pitched battle in the suburbs of Kyiv. Leshchenko’s cameo was brief, his monologue edited down to a few seconds embedded in a 20-minute documentary about Kyiv in wartime. But the response to the snippet of Leshchenko was instant and hostile. “The elite of Kyiv hangs out in disco bunkers,” one tweet excoriated.Back when Leshchenko was an ink-stained wretch, he enjoyed a reputation for adversarial zeal and superhuman integrity. When he entered politics, however, he found himself subject to the same scrutiny he had made a career of applying to those in power. Newspapers ran stories about his apartment, for which he’d paid about $300,000—far pricier than a former journalist’s salary could muster. (Leshchenko said he could afford it thanks to a loan from a former boss and the fact that his girlfriend was a renowned DJ playing lucrative gigs around the world.) Old enemies, and even erstwhile friends, skewered him.When the video appeared, he thought, “I’m in the middle of another shitstorm.” He braced himself for a reprimand. But nobody in the bunker mentioned the controversy to him. It didn’t register in the midst of a battle for the survival of the nation.Leshchenko understood why the video rankled; he even sympathized with his critics’ point of view. A return to normalcy might exact an intolerable price: “People could begin to feel distant from the war.” But he also stood by the sentiment that people under attack deserve to smile, to recover small pieces of the happiness that Russia had stolen from them.Two days after the video appeared, Leshchenko and Oleksiy Arestovych, an actor turned frequent government spokesman, hopped in a car and began driving away from the city. Ukrainian troops had liberated the Kyiv suburbs, but few from the bunker had ventured beyond the city center. The two men wanted to survey the wreckage of the Russian occupation for themselves.They drove silently through Bucha and Irpin, names that weren’t yet synonymous with the horrors that transpired in them. Arestovych would steer the car onto the sidewalk when burned-out Russian equipment barricaded the streets. Leshchenko had heard secondhand accounts of battle, but it was nothing like seeing the totality of the wreckage with his own eyes, the detritus of kitchens and laundry rooms strewn across the horizon of rubble, the stains of blood on the pavement, the lifeless eyes of the survivors.[Franklin Foer: Who defines Russia’s atrocities in Bucha?]When they returned to the bunker, they sought out Zelensky. “You really need to see this yourself,” Leshchenko told him. The president agreed.Dislodging the Russians from the environs of the city was one of the great upsets in modern military history—a victory that most analysts in the West hadn’t dared to imagine. But the revelation of atrocities in the liberated villages muffled any celebratory impulse in the bunker.Although the Ukrainian public largely believed that victory was within grasp, Leshchenko began to understand that the war likely would end not in months, but in years. If the Russians were going to treat the Ukrainians they conquered as vermin, then the occupation of Ukrainian territory was an intolerable concession. And if there weren’t any tolerable concessions to offer, were there any plausible grounds for a negotiated peace?Still, it slowly dawned on Leshchenko and his colleagues that the bunker was no longer a necessity, at least for the time being. They could return home. On April 28, Leshchenko slept in his apartment for the first time in seven weeks.On a cloudy June afternoon, I accompanied Leshchenko to the Office of the Presidential Administration, where Zelensky works. Residential apartments peer into the back of the hilltop complex. “See the clotheslines,” he said. Amused by the incongruous detail, he pointed at a woman’s leopard-print housecoat drying in the wind.Even though the Russians had largely stopped attacking Kyiv, sandbags remained piled in front of the building’s windows. A hallway was illuminated only by a cheap desk lamp sitting on the floor. Walking through the building felt like a stumbling trip to the bathroom in the middle of the night.\r\n\r\nLeshchenko holds an artillery shell in Toretsk, Donetsk Region, in June. (Courtesy of Sergii Leshchenko)\r\nLeshchenko led me into the press-briefing room, which had theater seats and a podium that Zelensky frequented. He wore his signature T-shirt, which announced I’m Ukrainian. Twice a week, Leshchenko appears in the room to record a short video debunking the latest in Russian agitprop. Today, he wanted to poke holes in an interview that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had given a day earlier—“full of outright lies and cheap manipulation.” Among his baseless provocations, Lavrov had accused Ukrainian soldiers of using drugs that prevented them from experiencing pain and fear.When he’s making conversation, Leshchenko tends to take long pauses to gather his thoughts, carefully calibrating his answers to questions. Over meals, he will look down and slurp his soup as he composes his sentences. At the podium, he inhabits a fast-talking persona whose every sentence sounds punctuated by an exclamation mark. He takes pride in not needing a script in his briefings, and razzed a colleague for reading from a teleprompter.“When I speak, I speak from the heart,” he teased.Rhetorically shredding the Kremlin’s ludicrous claims required him to lean on his old reporting skills, to muster facts. But he admitted that the task didn’t demand much of his intellectual capital—Russian propaganda tends to beggar belief. His job wasn’t so much to persuade as it was to remind the world how much the Russians hated Ukrainians. He wanted to relentlessly highlight the extravagant desperation of Russian lies. His counterpropaganda was its own form of propaganda.His briefings were a small part of how the Zelensky administration had overcome a historic impediment to Ukrainian democracy. When the country emerged from the Soviet Union, its people harbored a radical distrust of the state. The government was “them”—a distant entity that never represented or reflected the public interest. Not incorrectly, it was viewed as a mechanism oligarchs used for plunder. But in wartime, with the benefit of an external enemy, the government became “us”—a body worthy of trust, more organically connected to its citizenry. When its official mouthpieces, including Leshchenko, conveyed a message, the public tended to heed it—more so, at least, than it would have in the past.When we left the briefing room, Leshchenko took me for a bowl of borscht in the canteen. On our way, he suggested we stop in the building’s formal entrance. “Maybe we should take a selfie,” he said. We were standing near a colonnade, where the gaps between the columns were filled with rows of sandbags, piled 10 feet high. “This is a very famous place.” It was where Zelensky liked to greet visiting foreign leaders, a setting that never failed to impress, even if it was obviously an overwrought display that served no clear military purpose. A month later, Zelensky’s wife, Olena, would pose in the same place for an Annie Leibovitz spread in Vogue.As we left the foyer, we ran into a woman who had lived with Leshchenko in the bunker. While I stood to the side, they shared a reverie. “Whenever I see someone from there, it feels like a significant moment,” she told him.For Leshchenko, the Special Place had become an object of longing, a time that had passed. He may very well spend the rest of his life seeking to replicate it.In early summer, before the intolerable heat arrived, Kyiv was swept with an energy that surprised its residents. The trains from Poland were packed with returning refugees. Despite the curfew, young people went to the city’s dance clubs. Drivers on mopeds delivered food ordered on mobile apps.On a Saturday night, Leshchenko and Anton Ptushkin took me to a chic Thai restaurant overflowing with patrons, some of whom ate on blankets, spilling down a grassy lawn in front of the establishment.As a native of Kyiv, Leshchenko likes to wax lyrical about the “city of scars,” a metropolis that has survived centuries of successive traumas. The Russian invasion, he predicted, would eventually take its place in this lineage of suffering. This history of resilience made him strangely optimistic. There was even a chance that the war might leave the city with a greater self-confidence, a more expansive sense of its own possibilities. Squinting one’s eyes, it was possible to see that future on the lawn of the Thai restaurant.Leshchenko could easily inhabit the normalcy he’d extolled in his now-notorious monologue, but it also left him feeling inadequate, a bit empty. It was a sentiment I heard echoed by other men leading civilian lives in Kyiv. Some, like Leshchenko and Ptushkin, compensate by becoming amateur arms dealers. They raise money from abroad or dip into savings to procure trucks and drones, importing them from Poland and then hauling them to soldiers in the thick of action. It’s at least as much a salve to the anxieties of the benefactors as it is a boost on the battlefield.Two nights before our Thai dinner, Leshchenko and Ptushkin had driven east to deliver a caravan of Toyota trucks. It was a 14-hour ride into the Donbas, first along broad highways, then along constricted country roads.The caravan made its way to a village called Mykolaivka, about seven kilometers from the front line. They arrived at a small hotel late at night. Like every building in town, the hotel kept its lights off—a necessary defensive tactic, but hardly fail-safe.Dining in the dark, Leshchenko heard the screech of a Russian shell falling in the hotel’s direction. Before Ptushkin had time to react, he saw Leshchenko lying facedown. “He was the only one on the floor,” he remembered, with a touch of mockery. The woman running the hotel advised the group to crowd into a room in the middle of the building, protected by a pair of concrete walls.Heading to bed at that point didn’t make any sense. Leshchenko felt as if he had spent the evening pounding espresso. At one in the morning, another shell arced toward the hotel. When it landed about 200 meters away, the walls of the structure wobbled. “He was really scared,” Ptushkin remembers.But Leshchenko also admitted that he felt alive—pulsing with the same sense of vitality that he’d felt in the Special Place. “I’ve become an adrenaline junkie,” Leshchenko told me. “But I think it’s very human.”That craving kept propelling him back toward the front. As he described the feeling, he showed me a short clip that a friend had taken of him, running through thick brush, wearing body armor and sunglasses, as artillery exploded around him. He fetishized these moments and tried to hang on to them. In his apartment, he keeps shards of Russian bombs and missiles that he has collected on the battlefield, his own personal museum of the war.When Leshchenko returned to Kyiv, he went to a party. Arriving a bit late, he saw Ptushkin surrounded by a crowd of women, recounting their trip with great relish. “It used to be cool to go to the Maldives or the Seychelles,” Leshchenko joked. “Now it’s cool to say, ‘I was in the Donbas.’ ” The joke betrayed an anxiety that I heard Leshchenko express on multiple occasions. The war, which Kyiv experienced so intimately in the late winter, now risked becoming a distant piece of exotica. He worried that the public would lose touch with the conflict, and then lose interest. It wasn’t hard to imagine that he was also worrying about himself, that history, which he touched at every turn, might slip beyond his reach.This article appears in the October 2022 print edition with the headline “The Operator.”",

        "description": "Ivan Illich, from In the Mirror of the Past: \n\nRather than life in a shadow economy, I propose, on top of the z-axis, the idea of vernacular work: unpaid activities which provide and improve livelihood, but which are totally refractory to any analysis utilizing concepts developed in formal economics. I apply the term ‘vernacular’ to these activities, since there is no other current concept that allows me to make the same distinction within the domain covered by such terms as ‘informal sector, ‘use value,’ ‘social reproduction.’ Vernacular is a Latin term that we use in English only for the language that we have acquired without paid teachers. In Rome, it was used from 500 B.C. to 600 A.D. to designate any value that was homebred, homemade, derived from the commons, and that a person could protect and defend though he neither bought nor sold it in the market. I suggest that we restore this simple term, vernacular, to oppose commodities and their shadow. It allows me to distinguish between the expansion of the shadow economy and its inverse the expansion of the vernacular domain. \n\nOne of Les Murray’s collections of poems is called The Vernacular Republic, and while that title is usually thought to refer to Australia simpliciter, I don’t think that’s right. The Vernacular Republic is more an ideal image of Australia, what it might have been and perhaps (with repentance) still could be. \nI think if we take Illich’s understanding of the vernacular domain, and add to it the image of an alternative but “more comprehensive” economy that Wendell Berry writes of, then we have a rough outline of what a genuine Vernacular Republic would be. The Vernacular Republic is an “informal sector” that opposes the logic of commodity and gradually but steadily practices the Kingdom of God. ",

        "description": "Just one more sleep until dConstruct—squee!\n\nNot that I anticipate getting much sleep. My sleepnessness will partly be like that of a child on the night before Christmas. But my sleepnessness will also inevitably be that of an adult neurotically worrying about trifling details.\n\nIn reality, everything is all set. Thanks to the stellar Clearleft events team, I don’t need to lose any sleep. But my stupid brain can’t help but run a conveyer belt of potential problems through my mind: what about dongles? Power? Timings? What if there’s an impromptu rail strike? A deluge? Other emergencies you can’t even imagine?\n\nI try to ignore those pestering pointless questions and instead think about the fantastic talks we’re going to get. I’m genuinely excited about each and every speaker. I’m pretty sure that once the day begins, I’ll forget all my worries and bliss out to the mind-expanding presentations.\n\nThe day before a conference feels kind of like the build-up to a battle. All the strategic decisions have been made, everything is in place, and now there’s nothing to do but wait.\n\nI’ve communicated (or maybe over-communicated) all the relevant details to the speakers. And one week ago I sent one final email to the attendees with details of the schedule and some suggestions for lunch.\n\nI also included this request:\n\n\n  Could you do me a favour? Would you mind getting a hold of a Covid test sometime in the next week and taking a test a day or two before dConstruct? (And if you test positive, please don’t come to the event.)\n  \n  If you can’t get hold of a test (I know it can be tricky), then could you please bring a mask to wear when inside the venue?\n\n\nI think asking everyone to take a test is a reasonable request, and nobody has objected to it. I worry that it’s yet another form of hygiene theatre (like providing anti-bacterial handwash for an airborne virus). After all, the antigen tests are most effective when you’ve already got symptoms. Taking a test when you don’t have symptoms might well give a negative result, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you don’t have Covid. Still, it’s a little intervention that might catch an infection that otherwise would’ve spread further.\n\nI’m assuming that everyone coming to dConstruct is vaccinated. Maybe that’s naive on my part, but I figure if you’re intelligent enough to get a dConstruct ticket, you’re intelligent enough to protect yourself and others. So we won’t be requesting proof of vaccination. I hope my naivety aligns with reality.\n\nSee, this is all one more thing for my brain to gnaw on when I should be thinking about what a fantastic day of talks I’ve got ahead of me. Roll on tomorrow!",

The Yankees have gotten a solid start to their homestand, taking the first three games against Minnesota. It’s probably greedy to say that they need to complete the sweep, but given their play over the past month and the opponent that’s coming into town next, they can’t afford to ruin the momentum. The Twins seem cursed to never beat the Yankees even at their lowest, so take the gift in front of you.\nBefore the Yankees go for the sweep, let’s roll through what’s in store on the site. I’ll bring the latest Judge tracker and Peter has the results from the team’s rivals last night. Dan examines the team’s two strongest prospect pools at shortstop and center field to determine who is the best of the best, Jeff argues that Oswaldo Cabrera’s skill set has him well-positioned for a postseason roster spot, Sam dives into Jameson Taillon’s home run problem, and Josh re-visits Judge’s historic year with one month left to finish it.

Spencer Strider had another impressive start on Wednesday, as the Braves completed the two game sweep of the Athletics, who are very bad at baseball. Strider was very shaky in the first inning, as he walked three batters and required 36 pitches to get out of the inning. He then remembered that he is better than the entire Oakland roster and dominated for the rest of the game, leaving with 6.0 innings pitched, 9 strikeouts, just the 3 walks, and only the 2 runs allowed. Vaughn Grissom and Dansby Swanson each had a big homer to do the work on the offensive side, along with some sequencing runs. \nBraves News\nHere is our game recap from the fun 7-3 win over the A’s. \nHuascar Ynoa got Tommy John surgery somewhat out of the blue. \nMLB News\nMets’ Max Scherzer hit the IL with a left side injury in what is expected to be a short term stint. \nChristian Yelich, who has just not been the same player that he was since 2019 hit an absolute monster of a homer at 499 feet estimated on Statcast.",

        "description": "The debate around a proposal that aims to give news outlets the power to negotiate with tech giants to distribute their content is heating up ahead of a Senate markup of the bill slated for Thursday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBipartisan sponsors of the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act in the House and Senate released a revised version of the bill in August, which kicked off&nbsp;campaigns&nbsp;from advocacy groups for and against the legislation.\n\n\n\nChamber of Progress, Public Knowledge and 19 other advocacy groups sent a letter&nbsp;on Friday&nbsp;to top senators of the Judiciary Committee against the bill, arguing the revised version would force tech platforms to carry digital content “regardless of how extreme” it is.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the News Media Alliance, a trade association that represents newspapers across the U.S., dismissed the arguments made against the legislation and said it would help even the playing field after years of tech platforms decimating local news.\n\n\n\n“This is expected opposition based on the&nbsp;organizations&nbsp;asserting these claims,” Danielle Coffey, executive vice president and general counsel for the News Media Alliance, told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The attacks themselves, frankly, are just not substantiated by the text of the document, nor do they solve the problem that the legislation is trying to solve, which is to ensure fair compensation for high quality journalism,” she added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bill would allow digital journalism providers with fewer than 1,500 full time employees and nonnetwork news broadcasters to form joint negotiation entities to collectively negotiate with dominant tech platforms, such as Google and Facebook, over the terms associated with access to their digital news content.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt would also create a limited safe harbor from federal and state antitrust laws for eligible digital journalism providers that would allow them to participate in joint negotiation and arbitration to jointly withhold their content from a covered platform.\n\n\n\nThe bill's supporters say it is intended to help build back local news infrastructure after revenues have been cut into by tech giants sharing digital news content.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“To preserve strong, independent journalism, we have to make sure news organizations are able to negotiate on a level playing field with the online platforms that have come to dominate news distribution and digital advertising,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), chair of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, said in a statement when releasing the revised bill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bill is also sponsored by Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). In the House, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) is a lead sponsor, along with antitrust subcommittee Chairman&nbsp;David Cicilline (D-R.I.)&nbsp;and ranking member Ken Buck (R-Colo.).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdam Kovacevich, CEO and founder of the tech industry group Chamber of Progress, said his primary concern is that the bill would “effectively force online platforms to both fund and link to” right wing outlets, such as Infowars, Newsmax and One America News Network.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Our concern is that the JCPA would turn Big Tech platforms into kind of a guaranteed ATM and billboard for right wing news delivering funding and guaranteed links and traffic from their services,” Kovacevich told reporters on a call Wednesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGoogle and Facebook’s parent company Meta are both corporate partners that support the Chamber of Progress.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe core of&nbsp;the argument from advocacy groups opposing the bill is centered around a provision in the revised text of the bill that says a covered platform, referring to the dominant tech companies, may not “discriminate against any eligible digital journalism provider that is a member of a joint negotiation entity.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe letter sent by Chamber of Progress, Public Knowledge and other groups also argues that large media conglomerates will still be able to “dominate negotiations” and that “small outlets would be unheard,”&nbsp;because the proposal would apply to all outlets that employ fewer than 1,500 full time employees, a cap which only excludes the nation's three largest newspapers. The limit could&nbsp;also&nbsp;“create unintended consequences such as layoffs or transitions to more part-time or freelance employees,” the groups said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think those members of Congress who are supporting this see their local news outlets, they see the struggles that they're going through, and they want to do something good. And I think they need to take more time to look at the details of this bill, and the unintended consequences,” Chris Lewis, president and CEO of Public Knowledge, told reporters on the same Wednesday call.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe News Media Alliance, however, dismissed the argument about potential layoffs and said that the “opposite” will happen. In Australia, where a similar proposal was passed last year, the News Media Alliance said some newsrooms doubled in size after the change.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The information that we provide to communities is critical — whether it be health care, education, or what’s going on that nobody else will cover. There will be no other entity that comes in and covers a community, and attends a city hall meeting, or listens to a school board. It's not going to happen,” Coffey said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I've seen these newspapers go away and nothing replaces them, and the reason isn't an audience problem. It's a revenue problem,” she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;change in the news industry, she said, is “directly caused by the revenue that’s extracted by the platforms that do not come back to those who create the content.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It's not coincidental,” she said.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3633072-new-biden-midterm-strategy-over-democracy-comes-with-risks/",
        "description": "When Joe Biden entered the race for president in 2019, he declared that the “soul of the nation” was at stake. \n\n\n\nNow Biden is amping up that narrative as president, making the case that democracy and former President Trump’s election lies will be on the ballot in this fall’s midterm elections.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe new rhetoric makes sense politically. It gives Biden a chance to motivate Democrats into coming out to support the party in the midterms, when congressional majorities will be a stake. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nYet it also comes with some risks, as it requires the president to drop the unifying tone that has been a big part of his first-term messaging. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn castigating Trump and the Republicans aligned with him, Biden hopes to animate the Democratic Party’s liberal base while putting the former president on the ballot. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s a strategy Democrats sought to use in Virginia in 2021, when the party lost the state’s governorship. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House and Biden’s party are hoping for a better outcome this fall. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s messaging has been elevated by the FBI’s search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence one month ago, which has dominated headlines ever since. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe fight between Trump and the Department of Justice has worried Republicans, as it has given Democrats an opportunity to make the elections more about Trump. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats say the idea of protecting Democracy — and of casting Trump and his allies as threats to it — can be effective. Even if Trump is not on the ballot, Republicans closely tied to the ex-president, including Senate candidates Herschel Walker in Georgia, Blake Masters in Arizona and J.D. Vance in Ohio, will be.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The idea that there are folks that are unfit to hold public office and should not be in power is an issue that can be layered over whatever other policy issues are at play,” said Democratic strategist Rodell Mollineau.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPolling suggests Biden could be on to something. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Quinnipiac University&nbsp;poll&nbsp;released late last month found that 67 percent of American adults believe U.S. democracy is in danger of collapsing, while an&nbsp;NBC News poll&nbsp;released the same month found that a larger percentage of voters ranked threats to democracy as the most important issue facing the country than did cost of living.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden reintroduced the theme during a&nbsp;prime-time speech Thursday from Philadelphia, assailing Trump and Republicans aligned with him as threats to equality and democracy in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Too much of what’s happening in our country today is not normal. Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,” Biden said, referring to the former president’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden carried forward that message in speeches from Milwaukee and Pittsburgh on Labor Day, arguing that democracy is at stake in the midterm elections. In Wisconsin, Biden accused Trump-aligned Republicans of embracing political violence and defending “the mob that stormed the Capitol” on Jan. 6, 2021.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe theme is hardly brand new for Biden. In 2019, Biden said giving Trump eight years in the White House “will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are, and I cannot stand by and watch that happen.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s attack lines have been met with criticism from Republicans, including those who have rebuked Trump and his falsehoods about his 2020 election loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome have characterized Biden’s words as divisive and accused him of alienating a broad swath of voters who cast ballots for Trump during the last presidential election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Biden is making the political bet that talking about Trump enough will rev up his base and help voters forget inflation and rising crime,” said Doug Heye, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee. “But despite being blue-collar Joe, he failed to try to bring in those people who may have only reluctantly voted for Trump because they felt the Democrats have moved too far left.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“And in just branding everything ‘MAGA Republicans,’ it regurgitates the same rhetoric they used to call Mitt Romney too extreme,” Heye added, pointing to a tweet&nbsp;sent from Biden’s presidential Twitter account that suggested “MAGA Republicans” are aligned with Wall Street interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“What does that have to do with elections, democracy, Jan. 6?” Heye asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden and other White House officials have defended his remarks, saying the president is distinguishing between “MAGA Republicans” and “mainstream” Republicans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats say the narrative driven by Biden isn’t just tailored to the 2022 midterms. They say he’s offering a preview of shorts of his rhetoric in the upcoming presidential race as well. In recent months, Biden has said, both publicly and privately, that he plans to run for reelection in 2024. Trump is also weighing another bid for president, raising the prospect of a rematch between the two men.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocratic strategist Joel Payne said Biden’s message — including the major address he delivered last week in Philadelphia — is “more about 2024 than it is about 2022.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I viewed the speech last week as laying a predicate for 2024,” Payne said. “Why he’s essential for another term, why he’s relevant. It’s a bookend for the 'soul of the nation' speech he delivered in Charlottesville” at the start of his presidential campaign in 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne Democratic strategist put it this way: “It almost feels like Biden has divorced himself from the outcome of the midterms a little bit.&nbsp;Obviously,&nbsp;he cares about the&nbsp;outcome,&nbsp;but I think a big part of his message right now is catered to the general election.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNayyera Haq, a former Obama administration official, said the rhetoric is also about Biden solidifying his legacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Even if there are zero electoral benefits, there is the idea of legacy and what the history books will say about you,” Haq said. “You take Biden at face value. This is about the soul of the nation and the trajectory of our nation. “&nbsp;&nbsp;",

federal judge’s ruling granting former President Trump’s request for a special master has generated a range of intense reactions from legal experts, who have called it unusual, lacking in legal reasoning, “absurd” and offering undue favoritism to a former president.\n\n\n\nThe ruling in favor of Trump by federal district court Judge Aileen Cannon has been a head-scratcher for many attorneys, who say the court left behind many unanswered questions while also blocking an unprecedented investigation of a former president.\n\n\n\n“It does seem to reflect a fair amount of bending and stretching of the law in numerous different respects,” said Jeff Robbins, a former federal prosecutor and congressional investigative counsel.\n\n\n\nCannon surprised observers by indicating last month before she had heard any arguments in the case that she was inclined to grant Trump’s request.\n\n\n\nIt’s a detail that has gotten renewed attention, as experts say the ruling fails to deliver meeting the legal tests lawyers are trained to analyze while asking the special master to resolve major legal questions as Trump argues executive privilege should allow him to withhold executive branch documents from the current administration.\n\n\n\nIn her Labor Day ruling, Cannon repeatedly stressed optics as a rationale for having a third-party special master review the more than 10,000 documents taken during the search.\n\n\n\n“A commitment to the appearance of fairness is critical, now more than ever,” she wrote, noting that Trump may gain little from the exercise.\n\n\n\n“Plaintiff ultimately may not be entitled to return of much of the seized property or to prevail on his anticipated claims of privilege. That inquiry remains for another day,” she wrote.\n\n\n\nThe order puts the DOJ’s investigation on ice, barring investigators from reviewing any evidence until the special master is appointed and completes their review.\n\n\n\nRobbins said in order to grant an injunction to block a party from taking an action, the plaintiff must show not only a likelihood of ultimately succeeding in the case, but that they would be irreparably harmed if the request was not granted.\n\n\n\n“There was essentially not even lip service paid for these requirements. ... That's sort of, you know, frankly, injunction law 101,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMuch of Cannon’s ruling focused on potential damage to Trump’s reputation that could stem from the investigation, musing that details about the investigation could be leaked to the media.\n\n\n\nBut much of what the public knows about the investigation has been through court-ordered unsealing of DOJ records as well as from Trump himself.\n\n\n\n“And matter of fact, the only leak that has occurred in this is a leak by the former president himself of the existence of the search. So that to me is a glaring example of just ignoring the standards for granting an injunction,” Robbins said.\n\n\n\nOthers see the consideration of his status as a former president as inappropriately elevating Trump compared to others who would be unlikely to get similar treatment if their home were searched in the course of a criminal investigation.\n\n\n\n“The judge said that she thought that the fact that Donald Trump is a former president gives him heightened reputational interests, that there's more reason in this case to be worried about the reputational damage that a criminal charge could inflict than there is in a normal case. That strikes me as wrong and troubling in a country where nobody's supposed to be above the law,” said David Alan Sklansky, a professor at Stanford Law School and an expert in the Fourth Amendment and constraints on prosecutorial power.\n\n\n\nSklansky said Trump has a greater ability than most people caught up in criminal investigations to air their side of the story.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“His brand at this point is kind of tied up in his battles against the government. So I think that he's suffering less reputational injury than most people do when it's announced that they’re the subject of a criminal investigation,” he added.\n\n\n\nWhile the order spends ample time considering Trump’s arguments it spends relatively little considering the government’s argument that a special master would seriously hamper its investigation, covering one of the Department of Justice's principal objections with just a few sentences.\n\n\n\nBut experts say some of the more perplexing aspects of the order are those surrounding executive privilege, warning the ruling sets a dangerous precedent for allowing a former executive to hamstring a successor.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) argued that Trump’s very claim that some of the documents were protected by executive privilege proves their point — that they are government property and must be maintained by the National Archives.\n\n\n\nBut Cannon said the DOJ “arguably overstates the law” on the limits a former president has, leaving it to the special master to review the documents for both attorney-client protected materials — a relatively common service they provide to the court — and materials covered by executive privilege, which is an entirely unprecedented role.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s the kind of legal issue that courts and judges resolve generally, not special masters,” said Slansky, who himself has served as a special master.\n\n\n\nWhile Cannon’s ruling directs the special master to consider executive privilege, she does not lay out how.\n\n\n\n“Why would you outsource it? If you've got some basis for believing that these documents are protected by executive privilege, let's lay out what the standard is,” Robbins said.\n\n\n\n“It's not enough to say ‘I'm not persuaded that that executive privilege can never be invoked by a former president.’ Okay. That’s fine. So what are the standards that you're giving to a special master?”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPeter Shane, a law professor at New York University and an expert in executive privilege said he’s unsure what exactly the special master is supposed to assess.\n\n\n\n“You don't need a special master to identify whether the documents are potentially the subject of executive privilege. All of these documents, I assume, were communicated to the president or he wouldn't have them,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut he and Sklansky also see major risks to allowing a former president to withhold documents from the current administration.\n\n\n\n“That strikes me as completely wrongheaded because the government continues. And when we have a new administration come in, they have to continue the work of governing. And it strikes me as completely unworkable to say that when a new administration comes into office, they're restricted from knowing what kinds of discussions went on in the previous administration, that official government documents can be shielded from the current administration. That just strikes me as completely unacceptable,” he said, adding that’s something courts should not be eager to take ownership of.\n\n\n\nHe noted that even Cannon doesn’t offer a wholesale endorsement of the idea, allowing the intelligence community to access the records so they can do their own damage assessment.\n\n\n\nShane said the issues are even more pressing when considering the national security information Trump has in the tranche of records.\n\n\n\nHe said it's the constitutional duty of the president “to protect the national security from the moment of inauguration to the last minute of that person's term.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Protecting the national security right now is not Donald Trump's job; it is Joe Biden's job. And the idea that he might be shielding information relevant to our national security from the current administration, whose constitutional job it is to protect the national security, is absurd. It's an absurd claim,” Shane said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe damage that could result from affording Trump any right to executive privilege in this case is something that could unfold for years, he said.\n\n\n\n“It creates the idea that privilege belongs to a human being as opposed to the institution and the office of the presidency. That somehow the constitution imbues individual human beings with power in perpetuity — which is itself opposed to the idea of the rule of law and the idea that no one is above the law,” he said.\n\n\n\n“The responsibility of taking care that the law be faithfully executed is a job that belongs to whoever is president now. Not who was president four or 12 or 16 or 40 years ago … It needs to be available to the current president to see the records of prior administrations in order that they can do their job to the fullest.”",

        "description": "Democrats have seized political momentum over the past two months, mobilizing thousands of voters outraged over the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and passing a series of bills that have left the party's voters with a feeling of accomplishment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe legislative victories, coupled with former President Trump's legal problems, have left Democrats in a strong position to hold the Senate and even bolstered President Biden's approval ratings on the heels of a student debt forgiveness plan popular with college-aged voters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYet none of this may help Democrats with the House, where even after the spell of momentum, the party’s chances of holding onto its majority are still slim.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere's why:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRedistricting\n\n\n\nRedistricting didn’t deliver Republicans the kind of bulletproof House map that Democrats once feared it would, thanks to Democratic gerrymanders in states like Illinois and court rulings overturning heavy-handed Republican maps in places like North Carolina.\n\n\n\nBut the GOP is still set to gain ground this year under the new maps.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCourts in New York and Maryland struck down Democratic gerrymanders that would have offered the party some padding in a tough election year, while Republicans made huge gains in Florida after the GOP-controlled state legislature acquiesced to Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R) demand for a congressional map that created four new Republican-leaning seats.\n\n\n\nIn other states, such as Texas, where redistricting didn’t significantly alter the top line partisan breakdown of their House maps, Republican-controlled legislatures redrew the lines to solidify their current advantages and protect GOP incumbents.\n\n\n\nOverall, Republicans are expected to net three or four new House seats this year because of redistricting alone. That’s not insignificant, given that the GOP needs to net just five seats to recapture the House majority.\n\n\n\n“The environment still favors Republicans,” Doug Heye, a Republican strategist, told The Hill recently. “The math, especially with redistricting, favors Republicans.”\n\n\n\nDemocratic retirements\n\n\n\nHouse Democrats are grappling with a historic number of retirements this year, including a handful from competitive districts that look like prime pickup opportunities for Republicans.\n\n\n\nOverall, 31 House Democrats aren’t seeking reelection this year, choosing to either retire or run for a different office. Compare that to the 19 Republican members who aren’t running for another term.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s par for the course for some House members from the president’s party to leave Congress ahead of the midterms. In some cases, they’re longtime members who are looking to retire or move on to new endeavors. For others, the prospect of running for reelection in such a brutal political environment may have forced their hand.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the spate of Democratic retirements from the House still poses a challenge for the party. Incumbents typically have a baked-in advantage when seeking reelection; they already have name recognition in their district, as well as easier access to financial and party resources than newcomers do.\n\n\n\nRepublicans are also targeting a handful of competitive districts where Democratic incumbents aren’t running for reelection. That includes Pennsylvania’s 17th District, where Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.) won’t be on the ballot this year because he chose to run instead for the state’s Democratic Senate nomination, as well as Illinois’s 17th District, which is currently held by retiring Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.).\n\n\n\nThe national environment\n\n\n\nThere’s little doubt that the political landscape has improved for Democrats over the past two months.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe fight over abortion rights that was reignited over the summer gave the party and its voters a much-needed shot in the arm, evidenced by recent special election upsets and the rejection of a ballot question in Kansas that would have stripped abortion protections from the state constitution.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Democrats are largely outpacing their Republican rivals in fundraising and the party has seen a rebound on the generic ballot, a poll question asking voters which party they would rather see control Congress.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut unlike Senate contests, which hinge more on candidate quality and statewide campaign infrastructure, House races often pivot more on national trends. And in that regard, there’s still plenty for Democrats to worry about. Biden’s approval rating, while improving somewhat, is still underwater, and inflation remains at its highest level in decades.\n\n\n\nAnd despite the recent jolt of momentum for Democrats, party strategists said they’re clear-eyed about the possibility that things could take a turn for the worse in the two-month stretch leading up to Election Day. They’re bracing for an onslaught of Republican spending in the coming weeks, as well as a potential surge in GOP enthusiasm driven by Trump’s mounting legal troubles.\n\n\n\n“The national environment is good now for Democrats, but I need this to hold for 10 more weeks and that’s hard,” said one Democratic consultant, who’s advising candidates in multiple competitive races this year. “You’re at the mercy of a lot of things that you can’t control.”\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nDemocrats also have historical precedent working against them. Since the end of World War II, the president’s party has only picked up House seats in midterms twice — in 1998 and 2002.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn both cases, the circumstances were unique. Democrats gained seats in 1998 in part because of a backlash among voters over Republican-led efforts to impeach former President Clinton. And Republicans came out on top in 2002 as the country rallied around former President George W. Bush and the GOP in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\n\n\nBeyond that, the midterms usually bring bad news for the president’s party. And while the underlying causes of that trend aren’t always clear, this year’s midterms look a lot more like 2010, when a red wave swept Republicans into the House majority, than they do 1998.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s approval rating is nearly as low as Trump’s was at this point in 2018, right before Democrats recaptured the House majority in that year’s midterms. And an&nbsp;NBC News poll&nbsp;released late last month found that nearly three-quarters of voters — 74 percent — believe the country is on the wrong track.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt the same time, inflation remains high and there are still lingering fears that the U.S. may be heading toward a recession, even as some metrics, such as employment numbers, remain solid.\n\n\n\n“I think looking at where Americans are focused, it’s still inflation, skyrocketing gas prices, the economy,” said Matt Terrill, a Republican strategist and former aide to ex-Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. “Those kitchen-table issues.”&nbsp;",

Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday pledged to add permitting reform legislation to a stopgap funding bill that would prevent a government shutdown, but he’s in a tough spot as he seeks to deliver on a promise to Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).\n\n\n\nThe permitting reform is a side-deal Schumer struck with Manchin in late July to pass a climate, tax and health care bill known as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which is projected to help reduce that nation’s carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030.\n\n\n\nManchin offered his support for the bill in July after winning significant concessions, and his vote allowed Democrats to pass a major achievement for President Biden.\n\n\n\nSchumer made clear Wednesday that he doesn’t plan to backtrack on his promise.\n\n\n\n“Permitting reform is part of the IRA and we will get it done,” Schumer said Wednesday. “Our intention is to add it to the CR.”\n\n\n\nBut that plan is running into opposition from progressive House Democrats and outside environmental groups.&nbsp;There’s also a chance that several Senate Democrats may balk at the deal with Manchin, now that they no longer need his vote to pass a budget reconciliation bill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRep. Raúl Grijalva’s (D-Ariz.) office told The Hill on Wednesday that 50&nbsp;lawmakers&nbsp;had signed onto his letter calling for a separate vote on the permitting reform provisions instead of putting them in the continuing resolution.\n\n\n\nAttaching it to a short-term government funding measure would force House progressives to choose between voting no and possibly forcing a shutdown or voting yes and making it easier to develop new energy projects that would burn fossil fuels and pump more carbon into the atmosphere.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany environmental groups are also up in arms over the deal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore than 650 such organizations sent a&nbsp;letter&nbsp;to Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) expressing their opposition last month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This fossil fuel wish list is a cruel and direct attack on environmental justice communities and the climate. This legislation would truncate and hollow-out the environmental review process, weaken Tribal consultations, and make it far harder for frontline communities to have their voices heard by gutting bedrock protections in the National Environmental Policy Act and Clean Water Act,” they wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome Senate Democrats also said they couldn’t say whether they would support a short-term government funding bill that includes permitting reform until they review the details of the bill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said he wants to know what the net impact on carbon emissions will be from passing both the Inflation Reduction Act and the permitting reform package.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“‘Are we helping to solve the climate problem?’ is the question,” Whitehouse said. “I don’t even know what the permitting reform is.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd while many Republicans also support the types of reforms Manchin supports, several GOP senators on Wednesday panned Manchin’s proposal for not going far enough.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It seems pretty weak to me. I want to see how they have it written up but I hear it sounds pretty weak —&nbsp; ineffective,” said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), the ranking Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n\n\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), has said that he would oppose such a measure on principle, calling it part of a “political payback scheme.”\n\n\n\nThere is doubt over whether the government funding measure combined with permitting reform could pass the House, given the growing opposition from progressive House Democrats.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I like the idea of permitting reform. So, I'll certainly keep an open mind,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told The Hill on Wednesday. But he also said he’d be “surprised” if Manchin “gets what was promised.”\n\n\n\n“I know there were progressives over in the House that don't like the idea. They swallowed the reconciliation bill, but it's going to be an interesting process to watch,” he said, adding jokingly that “this may be a Lucy and the football moment” for Manchin.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSchumer could find a way around the jam by also adding to the government funding measure a bill to codify marriage equality. That could make it more difficult for House liberals to vote no, but it would also threaten Republican support for the package in the Senate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSchumer says his preference is to bring the marriage equality bill to the Senate floor separately.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We would prefer to do it as a separate bill. We hope there are ten Republicans to help us with that,” he said Wednesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA bipartisan group of Senate negotiators met earlier in the day in an effort to put together a deal on marriage equality legislation that could muster 60 votes in the Senate to overcome an expected GOP filibuster.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin (Wis), one of the lead Democratic negotiators on the marriage bill, said she also wants to keep it separate from the short-term government funding bill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBaldwin said Wednesday that she’s close to getting the 10 Republican votes she needs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of the bill’s cosponsors, told reporters on Wednesday the talks are making progress.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I'm never confident until a roll call. But we're making good progress. It's a lot of sincere interest,” Collins said.\n\n\n\nCollins’ comments came after she and Baldwin penned an opinion piece published in&nbsp;The Washington Post&nbsp;addressing “mischaracterizations” about the bill’s scope, including the idea that it would “legalize or recognize polygamous relationships or marriages.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome Democrats are hesitant to sign onto the idea linking the marriage bill and the government funding package, though they won’t rule out the proposal if it helps them get both priorities passed by the end of the month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I'm for the art of the possible,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), said. “If it makes it easier to pass it we should do it that way. If it makes it harder to pass it we shouldn’t.”\n\n\n\n“This is gaining, slowly in the Senate, bipartisan support,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said, referring to the marriage equality bill. “I'm hopeful that we can get it done whatever the vehicle.”\n\n\n\nSome Republican leaders are insisting on a clean funding package, potentially punting a separate vote on the marriage equality bill until after the coming midterm elections.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCollins and Baldwin have also pushed against using the funding bill as a vehicle for their bill, though they would like to see a vote before the November election.\n\n\n\nDespite opposition in the House, there is support among some climate hawks in the Senate to add Manchin’s permitting proposal to the government funding bill. They argue that it will bolster the deployment of clean energy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We are going to have to build big, planet-saving projects and the environmental movement has been organized around stopping things from being built and although that continues to be an important aspect of being an environmentalist, now we need to think about building projects that will save the planet,” Schatz said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut if enough liberals opposing the plan flex their muscles in the House, it’s not guaranteed the funding bill would get enough Republican votes to make it to Biden’s desk.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy attaching both permitting reform and marriage equality legislation to the CR, Schumer could shift blame to Republicans opposing the same-sex marriage measure.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOtherwise, progressives Democrats will have to swallow permitting reforms that will make it easier to build new energy projects and tougher for environmental activists to slow them down.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“My guess is, if it's on our CR, they're gonna have to eat it if they don't like it,” Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) said on the issue. “Or wrap their arms around it if they do.”",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/defense/3633199-biden-sparks-debate-with-marine-backdrop-to-combative-address/",
        "description": "President Biden sparked debate about his own adherence to political norms during his speech last week warning of GOP attacks on democracy, when the White House placed two Marines in the backdrop of his high-profile address from Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nIt wasn’t the first time a president has given a speech in front of the military. But as the nation becomes more polarized, even those who think Biden’s imagery was not particularly political say it was bad optics.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is — to take sort of a football analogy — this is a 5-yard penalty. Definitely not a 10- or 15-yard penalty or loss of downs,” said Peter Feaver, a professor of political science and public policy at Duke University.\n\n\n\nDuring his speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia on Sept. 1, Biden warned that former President Trump and other so-called MAGA Republicans represent a threat to the country.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House insisted that the speech was an official address and not a political one, but Biden invoked his predecessor by name — something he does not often do — and urged Americans to “vote, vote, vote!”\n\n\n\nThe speech elicited praise from the left and backlash from Republicans. But some common ground emerged over two Marines positioned behind him during the speech.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLt. Gen. Mark Hertling, who commanded U.S. Army Europe from 2011 to 2012, said on Twitter that he thought Biden’s speech was “ well delivered” and “definitely needed at this time in our history.” However, he said the military shouldn’t have been in the background.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Why is that my opinion? For the same reason I believe: the military shouldn’t attend political events in uniform; people running for office shouldn’t wear uniforms in ads/tout their veteran status in their campaigns; active duty personnel shouldn’t publicly support candidates,” he added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPaul Rieckhoff, founder of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, similarly praised Biden’s speech as “very powerful and important,” adding that it was “overdue in many ways.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, he said that if the presence of the Marines was not intentional, then it was “just sloppy.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Plenty of people in the White House know better. Or should. Either way, there’s just no need to have it even as a concern. It just shouldn’t be done in America,” Rieckhoff tweeted.\n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended the presence of the Marines during the speech.\n\n\n\n“The presence of the Marines was intended to demonstrate the deep and abiding respect the president has for these service members, to these ideals and the unique role our independent military plays in defending our democracy, no matter which party is in power,” Jean-Pierre said during a briefing Friday.\n\n\n\n“And it is not abnormal. It is actually normal for Presidents from either side of the aisle to give speeches in front of members of the military,” she added. “It is not an unusual sight or is not an unusual event to have happen.”\n\n\n\nPentagon Press Secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder didn’t answer a question on the Marines during a Tuesday briefing, instead referring to Jean-Pierre's comments.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Defense’s long-standing policy is that active-duty service members can carry out the obligations of citizenship but will not “engage in partisan political activities.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFurthermore, active-duty personnel are to “avoid the interference that their political activities imply or appear to imply DoD sponsorship, approval, or endorsement of a political candidate, campaign or cause.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the two Marines standing behind Biden during his speech were following orders, so they themselves didn’t do anything wrong, experts said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It certainly breaks with the norms of civil-military relations, and it puts the Marines in a tough situation,” said Katherine Kuzminski, a senior fellow and program director for Military, Veterans and Society at the Center for a New American Security.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Any service member who is asked to do something by the commander in chief is going to follow through on that — that is the bedrock of our expectations of the military. But it added a military flavor to the events in a way that didn't need to happen and that broke with the civil-military norms,” she continued.\n\n\n\nRecent presidents from George W. Bush to Barack Obama have drawn criticism for using the military as a political backdrop.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFeaver pointed out that the most obvious comparison made on Twitter was a speech Bush gave in 2003 aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln to declare the end of major operations in Iraq — commonly referred to as “Mission Accomplished.”\n\n\n\n“That was a speech that the Democrats in particular did not like, and there there was some element, perhaps, of politicization,” Feaver said. “But what he was doing was praising the sailors who had worked on that mission, so it was a little bit closer to legitimate than using the merely as wallpaper, which is what happened on Thursday night.”\n\n\n\nKuzminski pointed out that Obama announced a surge of 30,000 troops to Afghanistan to an audience of cadets at West Point Military Academy in 2009.\n\n\n\n“They were in the audience, they weren't standing behind the president, and they were the people who are going to be most directly affected by the policy. So while the president was making a broad political statement about military policies to the country, he's also directing his comments to the individuals who would be most affected,” she said.\n\n\n\nHowever, concern of politicization of the military rose to a fever pitch during Trump’s time in office, particularly after he threatened to use the military to quell demonstrators in summer 2020.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump’s rhetoric prompted tensions with military leaders, with his former Defense Secretary James Mattis offering stunning public criticism in a statement to The Atlantic.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJoint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley apologized in June of that year after he&nbsp;appeared alongside Trump in a photo taken outside of St. John’s Church in Lafayette Square after federal authorities attacked peaceful protesters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEarly on in his term, Trump signed an executive order temporarily barring entry of immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries during a ceremony at the Pentagon.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think that most scholars would agree that some of the violations there were above and beyond what we’ve normally seen with many presidents in terms of violating democratic norms of civil-military relations,” said Risa Brooks, a Marquette University political science professor who specializes in civil-military relations, of the Trump administration.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe increasing polarization across U.S. society has exacerbated those concerns over threats to civilian-military norms. It’s something that eight former secretaries of Defense and five former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff acknowledged in an open letter published in War on the Rocks.\n\n\n\nTheir letter noted that civilian control of the military is exercised by all three branches of government and that the members of the military “swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution, not an oath of fealty to an individual or to an office.”\n\n\n\n“Members of the military accept limits on the public expression of their private views — limits that would be unconstitutional if imposed on other citizens. Military and civilian leaders must be diligent about keeping the military separate from partisan political activity,” they wrote.\n\n\n\nKuzminski of the Center for a New American Security said future presidents would be well advised to take those warnings to heart.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“In the future, I think any president would — it would behoove any president to keep the military out of political speeches or political events and not put them in that position in the first place,” she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMorgan Chalfant contributed.",

It reflects the party’s long-standing challenges in building donor lists to power its campaigns.”",

        "description": "Scores, news, and notes, from around the Detroit Tigers’ farm system for Wednesday, September 7, 2022.  St. Paul Saints 10, Toledo Mud Hens 6 (box)\nThe Saints jumped all over Austin Bergner and held on to win their third straight over the Mud Hens.\nThe Saints got two runs in the top of the first, and three more in the second, eventually knocking Bergner out after three innings. They added another run in the fourth before the Hens finally started clawing their way back.\nDaz Cameron got the Hens going, launching a two-run shot in the fourth for his seventh homer of the season. Still the Saints added another run in the top of the sixth. In the bottom half, Zack Short led off with a single and Cameron followed with a walk. A double play ball from Jonathan Schoop moved Short to third, where he’d score on a wild pitch. \nShort came through with a two-run double in the seventh, and Cameron singled in Chris Rabago in the bottom of the ninth. The Saints just kept adding runs to hold them at bay.\nCameron: 2-4, R, 3 RBI, HR, BB, SO\nShort: 2-4, 2 R, 2 RBI, 2B, BB, SO\nComing Up Next: RHP Simeon Woods Richardson starts for the Saints on Thursday night. The Hens haven’t announced a starter yet. \nAltoona Curve 2, Erie SeaWolves 1 (F/10)(box)\nThe pitching was strong on both sides, but the Curve managed to score the Manfred runner in the top of the 10th, and the SeaWolves’ couldn’t match them on Wednesday.\nGerson Moreno gave Erie two perfect innings with four strikeouts in a bit of an opener start, before Brant Hurter took over. The big lefty punched out seven in four innings of work, allowing three hits and a walk. He did allow an unearned run in the third, as his own error covering first base with two outs in the inning cost him.\nThe SeaWolves had some chances early on and couldn’t take advantage. Quincy Nieporte led off the second with a double but was stranded. They had two on with two outs in the fifth, but couldn’t get a clutch knock. Finally in the eighth, Eric De La Rosa led off with a double, and Gage Workman doubled him home two batters later, but Workman was stranded as Parker Meadows grounded out, and Quincy Nieporte flew out to end the inning. \nBrendan White allowed a double in the 10th with the runner on second to lose the tie. Jon Rosoff started at second in the bottom half, and reached third on a wild pitch. Eric De La Rosa managed an infield single to lead off the 10th, but Rosoff had to hold at third and De La Rosa made a cardinal mistake in getting picked off. Rosoff was thrown out at home on an Andrew Navigato ground ball, and Workman struck out to end it. \nDe La Rosa: 3-4, R, 2B\nMeadows: 1-3, BB, SO\nHurter: 4.0 IP, 1 R, 0 ER, 3 H, BB, 7 SO\nComing Up Next: First pitch is set for 6:05 p.m. EDT on Thursday night. The Bowie Baysox lost as well, so the two clubs are still tied up with 10 games left on the schedule.\nGreat Lakes Loons 3, West Michigan Whitecaps 0 (box)\nThe Loons’ Adolfo Ramirez carved up the Whitecaps in this one, and the bullpen did the rest. The Whitecaps managed just three singles and a pair of walks on the night. \nCarlos Pena’s short start was quite good for the Whitecaps. He allowed a run over three innings, but punched out seven, allowing just three hits and a walk. The bullpen leaked a pair of runs, but the pitching was not the issue in this one.\nCrouch: 1-2, BB\nPena: 3.0 IP, ER, 3 H, BB, 7 SO\nComing Up Next: RHP Keider Montero (7-7, 4.74 ERA) takes on RHP River Ryan (1-1, 0.82 ERA) at 6:35 p.m. EDT on Thursday. Lake County won on Wednesday, so the Whitecaps are now two games back in the divisional chase with just four to play.\nLakeland Flying Tigers 7, Jupiter Hammerheads 0 (box)\nThe pitching was good, but it was two of the Tigers top young positional prospects who carried the Flying Tigers on Wednesday. \nLakeland started the scoring in the second. Andrew Jenkins reached on an error to start the inning, and stole second before scoring on a Dom Johnson single. In the third Cristian Santana doubled with one out and scored on a Peyton Graham single. Graham advanced on the throw in, and Jenkins knocked him in with a single.\nIn the fifth, Santana was drilled by a 94 mph fastball. Graham made them pay, launching his first pro home run to left field. Santana got further vengeance in the seventh when Iverson Leonardo was hit by a pitch leading off. Santana smoked a two-run shot, his ninth, to left field. The bullpen did the rest.\nSantana: 2-4, 3 R, 2 RBI, HR, 2B, SO\nGraham: 2-4, 2 R, 3 RBI, HR\nJenkins: 1-4, R, RBI, SO, SB\nComing Up Next: First pitch is set for 6:30 p.m. EDT on Thursday night.",

The iPhone XS was part of the second generation of notched iPhones, so it was all kind of about the notch — but it was also about the fancy OLED display that showed off perfect blacks compared to the XR’s traditional LED. Which is why Apple put a vibrant wallpaper with bright pops of color on the XS and the notch disappeared into the perfect black of the OLED display. There was something timid about the choice to hide it in the wallpaper, like Apple wasn’t quite as confident of its now fairly iconic screen cutout.

        "description": "Jefferson County School District Food Service Department staff arrange some of the hundreds of free lunches that was given to students on March 3, 2021 in Fayette, Miss. As one of the most food insecure counties in the United States, many families and their children come to depend on the free meals as their only means of daily sustenance.Rogelio V. Solis/APChildren had more access to food in 2021 compared to the previous year. But for other population groups, such as the elderly and women living alone, food insecurity was on the rise, according to the Agriculture Department. The rate of food insecurity was 6.2 percent for households with children in 2021, a decrease from 7.9 percent in 2020. The national average is 10.2 percent. The Department of Agriculture defines being food insecure as having had &quot;difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members because of a lack of resources.&quot; Rates of food insecurity increased for households with no children, especially for women and senior citizens who live alone. Rates declined for households with children under age 18, married couples with children, households with single mothers, and households in the South. The average American spent $62.50 per person every week on food. Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "A person walks down a street in Philadelphia, Pa.Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesA quarter of American adults say they live in fear of being attacked in their own neighborhoods, according to a poll by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The poll, conducted between June and July of this year and including a sample of 4,192 adults, found that Americans of color were more likely than white Americans to say they feared being threatened or physically attacked. The poll found that a quarter of Black respondents, 26 percent of Latinos, 36 percent of Native Americans, 21 percent of Asian adults, and 19 percent of white adults say they have feared someone might threaten them harm in their own neighborhoods.NPR interviewed several poll respondents about their individual reasons for feeling unsafe in their communities. Their answers ranged from looming threats of violent racism to fears of societal collapse due to politics. Read more below: He experienced overt racism in his youth and now fears for younger relativesPaul Ongtooguk, an Alaskan Inuit man living in Anchorage, has lived with this kind of fear for most of his life.&quot;Growing up, we went through the era when it was just open racism about being Alaskan Native,&quot; he says.Outside of Alaska, Ongtooguk says that people are less familiar with the appearance of Alaskan Natives, often leading to strangers making crude and offensive stereotypes about his race.&quot;This one was really weird. I was in Philadelphia, somebody asked me if I was an octoroon,&quot; Ongtooguk said, referencing an offensive, outdated term for a person of 1/8th Black ancestry. &quot;I had to look it up.&quot;At 65 years old, Ongtooguk says he thinks he has aged out of much of the overt racism that occurred in his youth, but he still fears for younger family members.Thousands of miles southeast in a small Texas town, 64-year-old Annette Jackson says her experience with violent racism has only worsened in recent years.A white man approached her in Walmart after the 2016 election and spat in her faceFollowing Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 White House victory, Jackson, who is of mixed race but presents as a woman of color, says she was assaulted by a white man while working her job at a Walmart deli counter.&quot;He said &#x27;Trump won,&#x27; and then he spit in my face,&quot; she says.Jackson says she reported the incident to management, but no further action was taken.&quot;It&#x27;s like Trump won so they had a right to treat me in a kind of way.&quot;Jackson&#x27;s example, while extreme, is not unusual.Last year, the FBI said that 2020 had seen the largest number of reported hate crimes since 2008. Attacks against Black and Asian Americans saw the most significant increases in that period.Jackson claims Black, white, Hispanic and Native American ancestry, and says she presents as a woman of color.&quot;I don&#x27;t feel safe at all,&quot; she says. &quot;I would hesitate to call the police in fear they&#x27;d shoot me instead of the person I&#x27;m calling the police on. There are people that ride around with the Confederate flags hanging out the back of their trucks. And, you know, I don&#x27;t feel safe. I don&#x27;t feel safe in America.&quot;Some attributed their fear to other powerful voicesNot everyone polled shared the same ideas on the root of violent crime. Bernardo Medina, 71, is a Puerto Rican born American living in New Jersey.He says he feared most for national security and blamed Democrats in power for &quot;emboldening&quot; enemies of the United States.&quot;The Democrats sold out this country&#x27;s national security long ago,&quot; he says. &quot;Starting with the Clintons. Later, the Obamas. And now the Bidens became rich by selling out this country. Plain and simple. The criminals are in power and the good people have to live in fear.&quot;He also blamed the Black Lives Matter movement and 2020 protests against police brutality for degrading social discourse.Those protests were overwhelmingly peaceful and sought to bring attention to state-sanctioned racist violence against Black people.&quot;They deceived a lot of people with their nice talk and then took the money,&quot; he says of Black Lives Matter national leadership, which has come under fire in recent months over accusations of financial impropriety. &quot;It&#x27;s all a hoax. It&#x27;s all a game.&quot;The unraveling of the nation&#x27;s social fabric was a common theme among respondents.‘I hope to never have to use my gun, but we&#x27;ve gone to gun safety classes in case we ever had to’Ernesto, a Black 37-year-old resident of a Philadelphia suburb, says social unrest was behind most of his fears for himself and his family. He declined to provide his last name.&quot;I feel like people aren&#x27;t understanding of different points of view anymore,&quot; he says. &quot;You never know where you&#x27;ll go, where you will no longer be welcome because of your point of view. People have preconceptions and prejudices that they amplify now. And I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because we hear about it more through social media or if it&#x27;s actually the case.&quot;&quot;I never felt discriminated against,&quot; he says. &quot;I knew it existed, but I never felt it directly against me. Whereas now I&#x27;m afraid that I will be because you hear about it so much more and so often. So, yeah, I&#x27;m totally afraid of traveling the country. I don&#x27;t want to go somewhere and end up in a place that I didn&#x27;t realize would be unwelcoming to someone like me.&quot;Also compounding Ernesto&#x27;s concerns is the looming threat of gun violence, which he says keeps him from traveling into the city any more than is necessary.And since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, he says that he and his wife have begun stockpiling supplies in the event that something catastrophic happens. He says he doesn&#x27;t trust the government to be able to care for his family in times of crisis.&quot;We have food supplies, we have generators, we have our evacuation plan so that I feel like I don&#x27;t need to wait for the government to give me instructions or assistance to take care of myself,&quot; he says. &quot;I hope to never have to use my gun, but we&#x27;ve gone to gun safety classes in case we ever had to. And we know that there might be a time when we have to.&quot; Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "Tariq and his family traveled from New York to South Dakota&#x27;s corn palace for a ceremony honoring his new position as the state&#x27;s official corn-bassador.Travel South DakotaEverything changed for 7-year-old Tariq when he slapped some butter on an ear of corn. He knew it tasted good, but butter made it better. His passion for produce landed him a sweet gig last Saturday as South Dakota&#x27;s official Corn-bassador.Some people might see corn as just a starchy vegetable. But to Tariq (whose last name wasn&#x27;t released for privacy reasons), it&#x27;s a big, beautiful lump with knobs on it. His favorite part is the juice that comes out as he&#x27;s chowing down, he told an interviewer on the YouTube channel Recess Therapy in a video posted last month.&quot;I mean just look at this thing, I can&#x27;t imagine a more beautiful thing, it&#x27;s corn!&quot; Tariq said.Tariq&#x27;s profession of love for his favorite vegetable earned him the nickname the &quot;Corn Kid&quot; after his interview racked up millions of views and was made into a song. Last Saturday, he was dubbed South Dakota&#x27;s official corn-bassador by Gov. Kristi Noem, who declared Sept. 3, 2022, Official Corn-bassador Tariq Day.&quot;Whereas, South Dakota is one of the top corn producers in the nation, providing nourishment across the globe but especially to Tariq, a 7-year-old boy who recently discovered that corn was real,&quot; the governor&#x27;s declaration reads,  &quot;... it is fitting and proper as Governor to make special note of outstanding young man.&quot;Tariq said everyone doesn&#x27;t have to like corn, but everyone should definitely try it, especially with butter.Travel South DakotaKatlyn Svendsen of the South Dakota Department of Tourism told NPR that the Corn-bassador and his family traveled from New York to attend an honorary ceremony at the state&#x27;s Corn Palace in Mitchell, S.D.&quot;As part of naming Tariq a South Dakota Corn-bassador, we wanted Tariq and his family to experience a combination of South Dakota&#x27;s two largest industries, tourism and agriculture,&quot; Svendsen said.She said Tariq couldn&#x27;t believe his eyes when he saw the palace made of corn. &quot;It&#x27;s a dream come true!&quot; he said.\nTariq said an ear of corn should cost $1, and though everyone doesn&#x27;t have to love it, everyone should certainly give corn a taste, especially with butter. &quot;If you or anyone loves corn, if you come to me, I&#x27;ll tell you all about it,&quot; he told Recess Therapy.\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "Anne Garrels on location in Iraq in 2006Dianna Douglas/NPRAnne Garrels, longtime foreign correspondent for NPR, died on Wednesday of lung cancer. She was 71 years old.At NPR, Garrels was known as a passionate reporter willing to go anywhere in the world at a moment&#x27;s notice if the story required it. She was also a warm and generous friend to many.When she arrived at NPR in 1988, she already had a lot of experience under her belt — including 10 years in television news at ABC, where she was bureau chief in both Moscow and Central America.Garrels made a strong impression on NPR&#x27;s Deborah Amos. &quot;She was this glamorous television reporter who came here,&quot; she said. &quot;She didn&#x27;t dress like the rest of us in the beginning. And she&#x27;d has this long and remarkable career before she landed here ... She was always braver than me, and I always understood that she was braver than me.&quot;That bravery led Garrels into many war zones. And when it came to covering a war, she was there at the beginning, in the middle of the battle, and at the peace table. She was the kind of reporter who would drive alone across a war zone if that&#x27;s what it took to get the story.But in a 2003 interview with NPR&#x27;s Susan Stamberg, Garrels insisted that she was not a &quot;war junkie.&quot; &quot;I didn&#x27;t set out to be a war correspondent,&quot; she said. &quot;The wars kept happening.&quot;As Ted Clark, one her former NPR editors, remembered it, Garrels was a prolific reporter with a seemingly endless curiosity about the world.&quot;She went everywhere, she was on every continent. I looked at her stories on the NPR archives, and there were 90 pages. And on all kinds of subjects, not just political, not just military but social, artistic, cultural,&quot; Clark said.NPR&#x27;s Philip Reeves worked with Garrels on many stories from Iraq to Pakistan, but he first met her in Moscow. He said Garrels had a deep love and understanding of Russia.&quot;Unlike a lot of reporters who just go out there and collect quotes and relay them to their editors, Annie could actually get right inside the minds and hearts of people, and that&#x27;s what made her an incredible reporter,&quot; he said.As much as Anne Garrels loved Russia, she is probably best known for her reporting during the 2003 Iraq war. She was one of a handful of foreign reporters who remained in Bagdhad as the war began. As she told Susan Stamberg, she used a satellite phone for her reports and went to great lengths to conceal it from Iraqi authorities.&quot;And then I decided it would be very smart if I broadcast naked, so if that, god forbid, the secret police were coming through the rooms, that would give me maybe five minutes to answer the phone, pretend I&#x27;d been asleep and sort of go &#x27;I don&#x27;t have any clothes on!&#x27; And maybe it would maybe give me five seconds to hide the phone,&quot; she said.Garrels later wrote about her wartime experiences in Iraq in a book called Naked in Bagdhad. NPR&#x27;s Deborah Amos, who also reported from the Iraqi capital, remembered that Garrels sometimes took extraordinary risks to get a story.Once, she had wanted to do a piece about cemetery workers in Najaf. &quot;This was at the height of the killing and it was terrible in Bagdhad, and frightening. And so Annie rolled in a carpet in the back seat of a car, through the worst neighborhoods, so that she would not be visible,&quot; Amos said. &quot;The piece was beautiful, and no one — of course, except for all of her colleagues — knew what it took for her to do that.&quot;It&#x27;s not that Garrels wasn&#x27;t afraid, said her friend Phillip Reeves — it&#x27;s just that her need to tell a story sometimes drove her to take risks that others wouldn&#x27;t. And, Reeves said, it wasn&#x27;t just her bravery that set Garrels&#x27; reporting apart from the rest of the pack. She had another great quality: empathy.&quot;I think at heart she loved people, actually. And that, in this day and age it&#x27;s unusual, she gave them time. She would sit down with people and really talk through what had happened to them. So, when you were sitting next to her when she was doing that, you often saw a whole story unfold that you didn&#x27;t realize was there, because Annie&#x27;s imagining what it&#x27;s like to be them,&quot; he said.\nThose same qualities that made Anne Garrels a great reporter, said Reeves, also made her a great friend who will be sorely missed.\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "Authorities said on Wednesday that Myles Sanderson (right), the second suspect in the stabbing deaths of 10 people in the province of Saskatchewan, died shortly after his arrest. Damien Sanderson (left), his brother, had been found dead on Monday with wounds that did not appear to be self-inflicted.APUpdated: Sept. 7, 2022 at 9:50 p.m.The second suspect connected to a mass stabbing spree died shortly after being taken into police custody, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have confirmed. In a press conference, the RCMP said that Myles Sanderson went into what was described as &quot;medical distress&quot; shortly after being detained earlier Wednesday afternoon. He was taken to a hospital in Saskatoon and pronounced dead, Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore told reporters. She said she could not provide further detail about his death, except to say that &quot;all life-saving measures were taken.&quot; There will be an investigation launched into the circumstances surrounding his death, Blackmore said, and an autopsy will be conducted later this week. Along with his brother Damien, Myles Sanderson was a suspect in a series of stabbings that killed 10 people in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. His death comes two days after Damien Sanderson was found dead with wounds that did not appear to be self-inflicted, according to authorities. Myles Sanderson was arrested after police received reports that a man matching his description had stolen a vehicle, Blackmore said, which culminated in a car chase. Police &quot;directed&quot; his vehicle into a ditch, she said. The stabbings took place Sunday morning in 13 locations across the James Smith Cree Nation and the nearby village of Weldon. A motive has not yet been determined; police said they believe some of the victims were attacked at random, while others were singled out. Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore said that, before Sanderson&#x27;s arrest, she had visited James Smith Cree Nation, where many told her they were still frightened by the prospect he might attack again.&quot;I hope that this brings them some closure in that they can rest easy tonight knowing that Myles Sanderson is no longer a threat to them,&quot; Blackmore said.Before their deaths, the two Sanderson brothers had been charged with a total of four counts of first-degree murder, two counts of attempted murder and two counts of breaking and entering a residence.

and eyes, politics and whys.\n\n\n\nFormer President Trump’s cartons of U.S. classified and intelligence documents, now in the hands of the Justice Department, present legal and political challenges for Attorney General Merrick Garland and his team as they ponder a court deadline this week that’s akin to three-dimensional chess for the executive branch.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDOJ’s choice about whether to appeal an order to select an independent reviewer to examine the materials seized on Aug. 8 at Mar-a-Lago could impact future presidents, stall an investigation involving allegedly mishandled U.S. intelligence and hand the former president and his allies months of political openings to stoke distrust of the FBI and the Biden administration.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Senate Republicans are scrambling to play defense without knowing exactly what Trump removed from the White House, how his retention of sensitive materials may have compromised U.S. secrets and whether he is guilty of actions that would result in criminal penalties for any lesser current or former U.S. official. Trump’s documents drama could pose complex legal, international and political repercussions for his future — in 2024 and beyond.\n\n\n\nAhead of the midterm contests, Republican senators want to talk about President Biden’s economic record and inflation but instead are barraged with questions about Trump’s decision to stash more than 300 classified documents at his personal residence, reports The Hill’s Alexander Bolton.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s stunning, it’s outrageous that highly sensitive documents of the United States of America were kept in an insecure place. That’s why we have laws to prevent it,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told The Hill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I think classified information is supposed to be handled in a certain way and obviously we understand that here,” Senate Republican Whip John Thune (S.D) added, referring to a secure facility in the Capitol that must be used by senators to review sensitive intelligence documents. “The rules … are pretty clear.”&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ Politico: GOP offers strained Trump defenses in the Mar-a-Lago probe — for now.\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Florida judge throws Trump, DOJ curveball with special master decision, according to legal experts.\n\n\n\n▪ The New York Times: Garland faces tough calls in weighing a response to a judge’s Trump ruling.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department has until Friday to propose a specific independent reviewer or appeal a judge’s ruling in Trump’s favor that involves his claims of potential attorney-client privilege and executive privilege. The unusual legal questions presented have become a test of Trump’s (and perhaps any future president’s) post-White House powers (The Washington Post).\n\n\n\nThe New Yorker Q&amp;A reports on where the Trump documents investigation could head: “On Friday, if the government doesn’t make an immediate appeal, or if it does but still goes ahead and makes the filing, it will want to be pressing for some pretty tight timelines on any special master to complete the review, because what the government does not want to have is this dragging out,” explained Mary McCord, a former assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and a former acting assistant attorney general for national security. McCord is Georgetown University Law Center executive director of the nonpartisan Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection.\n\n\n\nWith 61 days to go until Nov. 8, election handicappers and political strategists predict Republican candidates remain favored to win control of the House this year, even if by a smaller margin than projected as the summer began. In Republicans’ favor: Democratic retirements and gerrymandered districts. The Hill’s Max Greenwood unpacks the political conditions for Republican candidates.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ Yahoo News: Biden leads Trump by 6 points in a hypothetical 2024 rematch, the widest margin in six months, according to the latest Yahoo News-YouGov poll.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ Reuters explainer: What’s at stake in the 2022 congressional elections.\n\n\n\n▪ Politico: Democratic governors in the big battlegrounds are looking strong — but the GOP is expanding the map.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n▪ &nbsp;Politico: Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D), vying for a Senate seat, said during an interview that he will debate GOP opponent Mehmet Oz this fall once they iron out accommodations for Fetterman’s “auditory processing” challenges caused by a stroke.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ The New York Times: There is no law barring a convicted or imprisoned felon from becoming president. With that in mind, some in Congress want to disqualify Trump in 2024 as an “insurrectionist” under a clause in the Constitution.\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Biden sparks debate with Marine backdrop to combative address.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill and The Associated Press: Gloves off in new Biden midterm strategy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\n\n\n➤ CONGRESS&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSenate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) promised on Wednesday to pass a side deal he struck this summer with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.). The hitch: opposition from progressive Democrats in the House and Senate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSchumer said he will attach permitting reform legislation that would speed the development of fossil fuel and other energy projects to the stopgap spending measure Congress must approve to keep the federal government funded beyond Sept. 30 (The Hill).\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post: Senate negotiators push toward a same-sex marriage vote this month, possibly as early as next week, with GOP support.\n\n\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee today is expected to mark up a proposed bipartisan Journalism Competition and Preservation Act that aims to give news outlets power to negotiate with tech giants such as Google and Facebook to distribute their content and local news (The Hill).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA delegation of U.S. lawmakers arrived in Taiwan on Wednesday on a previously unannounced trip, the latest group of senior U.S. officials to visit the island and defy Beijing, which has reacted with anger to such exchanges. The de facto U.S. Embassy in Taiwan said eight lawmakers, led by Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, would be staying until Friday as part of a larger visit to the Indo-Pacific region (Reuters).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES\n\n\n\n➤ ADMINISTRATION\n\n\n\nOn canvas, former President Obama is a portrait almost in black and white, his gaze steady and inscrutable, his posture relaxed and self-contained against a white background, his tie the same steely gray as his hair.\n\n\n\nMichelle Obama, who for eight years with her husband appeared to be a study in motion and energy, is seated and still, depicted in vivid color on a White House Red Room sofa, attired in a pale blue evening gown, both shoulders bare.\n\n\n\nIn the halls of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., the 44th president and the former first lady will be frozen in time as the contemporary pathbreakers they were and are, depicted among iconic visages of predecessors, including Abraham Lincoln and Jacqueline Kennedy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday during a “hanging” ceremony full of bonhomie in the East Room hosted by Bidenand first lady Jill Biden, guests applauded the official White House portraits of the former president painted by Robert McCurdy, and of Michelle Obama, painted by artist Sharon Sprung. The Obamas selected the artists, each of whom worked from photographs.\n\n\n\nThe Hill: “I want to thank Sharon Sprung for capturing everything I love about Michelle. Her grace, her intelligence, and the fact that she is fine,” Obama said, to appreciative clapping.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe nonprofit White House Historical Association helps manage the portrait process and since the 1960s has paid for most of those in the collection through private donations and merchandise sales. Other portraits of the Obamas remain popular with traveling exhibits from the National Portrait Gallery collection. Those works by artists Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald return to Washington in November.\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press published a short video tour of White House portraits HERE, and the White House Historical Association created a longer video showcase HERE.\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill’s In the Know: Here are the official White House portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ Reuters: The White House event included a Trump barb and a tan-suit joke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPINION\n\n\n\n■ A better strategy to rein in Big Tech: Congress should pass the Open Apps Market Act, by Joel Thayer, opinion contributor, The Hill. https://bit.ly/3BlYXDk\n\n\n\n■ Oklahoma embarks on a grotesque execution-spree, by The Washington Post editorial board. https://wapo.st/3D5ELXG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHERE AND WHEN\n\n\n\nThe House will meet on Friday at 9 a.m. for a pro forma session and return to work in the Capitol on Sept. 13.\n\n\n\nThe Senate convenes at 10 a.m. and will resume consideration of the nomination of Andre Mathis to be a United States circuit judge for the 6th Circuit.\n\n\n\nThe president will receive the President’s Daily Brief at 9 a.m. Biden will promote the nationwide availability and accessibility of updated COVID-19 vaccine boosters during a Roosevelt Room speech at 1:45 p.m. The president will headline a Democratic National Committee fundraising event at 7 p.m. in Montgomery County, Md., and return to the White House.\n\n\n\nVice President Harris will speak in Houston at the National Baptist Convention 142nd Annual Session at noon local time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen is in Dearborn, Mich., to deliver a 2 p.m. speech at Ford Motor Co.'s Rouge Electric Vehicle Center about the administration’s economic growth strategy and the Inflation Reduction Act’s alternative fuel incentives for vehicles and transportation (Detroit News).

Security Council, the United States formally accused Russia of a war crime by forcibly deporting “hundreds of thousands” of Ukrainians to Russia, including children, and said it has information that Russian officials are overseeing so-called filtration operations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"These operations aim to identify individuals Russia deems insufficiently compliant or compatible to its control,\" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told her counterparts (Reuters). The United States is among 45 nations coordinating the investigation of alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Russia dismissed the allegation as “fantasy,” calling it the latest invention in a Western disinformation campaign (Politico).\n\n\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, during a defiant speech on Wednesday to an economic forum in Vladivostok, called Western sanctions “stupid” and threatened to halt all energy sales to Russia’s critics if they move forward with a cap on oil prices proposed by the Group of Seven industrialized economic powers.\n\n\n\n“I’m sure we have not lost anything and will not lose anything,” Putin said of Russia’s prospects despite war with Ukraine, heavy military casualties and punishing international sanctions. “The main thing is strengthening our sovereignty, and this is the inevitable result of what is happening now” (The Washington Post).\n\n\n\nPutin’s power over natural gas supplies is weakening, according to European Union leaders (The New York Times), who say they plan to cap Russian natural gas prices after Putin threatened to cut off all energy supplies if the EU takes such a step. The specter of energy rationing in some of the world's richest countries this winter is the talk of Europe (Reuters).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPutin and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet next week in Uzbekistan at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, Russian Ambassador to China Andrei Denisov announced on Wednesday (The Associated Press). The two leaders last met in February weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine. Moscow and Beijing have increasingly aligned their foreign policies to oppose liberal democratic forces in Asia, Europe and beyond, making a stand for authoritarian rule with tight borders and little regard for free speech, minority rights or opposition politics.\n\n\n\nIn rare public comments, Ukraine’s military commander in chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, warned on Wednesday of the threat of Russia using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which he said would create the risk of a \"limited\" nuclear conflict with other powers (Reuters).\n\n\n\n➤ ECONOMY\n\n\n\n💰 Wage increases for job-switchers compared with compensation for employees who have not pulled up stakes indicate the monetary benefits of moving on in a tight labor market. Research shows millennials and Gen Zers have taken advantage of the current labor shortages, switching jobs more frequently than their older colleagues and, in return, reaped pay hikes and other benefits. If the U.S. economy contracts, the labor market will likely take a hit, according to economists. That means the window of opportunity for job hoppers to leverage demand for their skills, especially those workers at the bottom of the income ladder, will begin to close (The Hill).\n\n\n\n⛽ Inflation: U.S. gasoline prices keep tumbling. The average price of a gallon of gas was $3.76 per gallon on Wednesday, according to AAA’s gas price tracker. That’s a decrease of $1.26 per gallon since prices reached a peak in mid-June. If oil prices continue to decline, drivers will likely continue to see pump prices drop further, AAA predicts. … Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard on Wednesday added her voice to those reinforcing expectations that the central bank later this month will opt for a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point rate rise. “We are in this for as long as it takes to get inflation down,” she said (Financial Times). The Fed concludes a two-day meeting on Sept. 21.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n➤ TECH\n\n\n\nApple had a surprise in store on Wednesday: No U.S. price hikes for its newest iPhone, despite inflation and supply chain challenges (CNBC).

Think themes: personal health data (Apple Insider) and safety features (CNBC).&nbsp;\n\n\n\n➤ PANDEMIC &amp; HEALTH\n\n\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) on Wednesday lifted a mask mandate covering New York transit, which commuters disliked and found confusing. “We haven’t seen any [COVID-19] spikes, and also people are getting back to work, back to school,” she said during a press conference at a health center in New York City, shortly before receiving her omicron-targeted booster that’s being made available this week. “We have to restore some normalcy to our lives” (Bloomberg News).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nChina’s continued COVID-19 lockdowns will likely lead to long-lasting political and economic consequences, Foreign Policy reported on Wednesday in its China Brief.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n🦠 Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) tested positive for COVID-19 while traveling in India for an eight-day economic itinerary and will isolate there and return to the United States next week, his staff said on Wednesday (The Hill). … Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) also tested positive for the coronavirus, his office announced on Wednesday (The Hill).\n\n\n\nTotal U.S. coronavirus deaths reported as of this morning, according to Johns Hopkins University (trackers all vary slightly): 1,048,989. Current average U.S. COVID-19 daily deaths are 336, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\nThe Hill: A United States District Court in Texas on Wednesday ruled against the Affordable Care Act’s mandatory coverage of HIV prevention drugs. The administration says it is reviewing the opinion.\n\n\n\n➤ STATE WATCH\n\n\n\nCalifornia is in the news today because of extreme heat, drought, wildfires and coping woes, including threats of rolling blackouts and restrictions on electricity and water. Here are five things to know about conditions in the Golden State (The Hill) and a look at how California is responding to record high temperatures (The Hill).\n\n\n\nAs weather-related hazards appear nationwide, the focus on energy and water now and in the future continues to be shadowed by past decisions, or rather, indecision. For The Atlantic, Robinson Meyer reports that the U.S. electricity industry knew about the dangers of climate change 40 years ago and denied them anyway.\n\n\n\nIn Nevada, police on Wednesday arrested Clark County Public Administrator Robert Telles, 45, in connection with the slaying of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German, who had written stories about alleged bullying and favoritism in the politician’s office. Police made the arrest on suspicion of murder after serving a search warrant at Telles’ home. He is to appear in court today. German was found stabbed to death outside his residence on Saturday and was likely killed on Friday (NBC News).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE CLOSER\n\n\n\nTake our Morning Report Quiz\n\n\n\nAnd finally … 🏈 It’s Thursday, which means it’s time for this week’s Morning Report Quiz!

        "description": "Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images\n    \n\n  A 4.5 game deficit with 25 games left to play is a tall order for any team to overcome. Hello, friends.\nThree freaking hits. The Orioles needed a strong effort against the Blue Jays last night to keep themselves from falling too far back in the wild card standings and all they could muster was three freaking hits and one freaking walk. The team may have made it to September with meaningful games still to be played, but unfortunately, the way they’ve played since Monday has made it where there aren’t likely to be any more meaningful ones coming after this.\nCheck out Stacey’s recap for the not-so-lovely totals from the 4-1 loss to the Jays. There wasn’t much good to say. Tyler Wells being brought back earlier than expected from his rehab assignment didn’t pay off. Cy Young candidate Alek Manoah was better than the Orioles offense. It wasn’t fun. Despite the new branding around Camden Yards, chaos was not comin’.\nSo, what now? The John Mellancamp observation, “Life goes on long after the thrill of livin’ is gone” is true also for baseball seasons. The excitement of a playoff chase is over and yet the season isn’t over until October 5. The tragic number - the combination of O’s losses and Blue Jays wins - after which they’ll be eliminated from the wild card race is 22. That mathematical elimination won’t happen for a while, perhaps not even until October.\nThat said, unless the Orioles start an eight-game winning streak on Friday, there’s just too much ground to pull back. The team had enough talent to get this far but it seems like this is as far as this group could get. The remaining games should be spent figuring out who is really, truly a keeper as the team heads towards a new season where there will actually be expectations from the get-go, rather than an ongoing audition process that brings through a bunch of bad players while trying to unearth some gems.\nWho’s worth keeping in a starting rotation where the team goes into the season with playoff aspirations? Is an outfield of Austin Hays, Cedric Mullins, and Anthony Santander really good enough to do it? Do the O’s want to try to do better than Ryan Mountcastle’s 2022 performance in their first base/designated hitter positions? Who of the successful relievers can repeat that into 2023 and which of the less successful ones might be able to do better? If they want something better in one of these spots, is an option from within the system viable in the short-term? Or do they need to find something better from outside?\nThese are the kinds of questions that the team will be answering over the last several weeks of baseball, rather than the much more fun one of, “Can the Orioles earn a wild card spot?” Dating back to August 20, the Orioles have averaged only 3.55 runs per game. They’re 10-7 in those games, so it could be worse, but that’s just not good enough offense to hang around much deeper into the season than now.\nThere is an off day today where all of this can be digested. A number of hitters certainly seem like they could use the off day, and it won’t hurt the pitching staff either, since that may give them a chance to reset the starting rotation a bit. It still remains to be seen when Jordan Lyles will slot back in after the stomach virus that wiped him out on Monday kept him out of action the last couple of games as well.\nThe team will be back in action, if you want to generously label the recent pattern of offense as “action,” on Friday at home against the Red Sox. That series opener gets under way at 7:05. Currently expected to start for the Orioles is Austin Voth, with 5.91 ERA and 1.813 WHIP guy Brayan Bello pitching for the Red Sox.\nAround the blogO’sphere\nFor Orioles pitcher DL Hall, teal and orange glove a reminder of how far he’s come (The Baltimore Sun)With the focus turning away from daily changes to the postseason chase, there are probably going to be more little stories like this. It would be nice if there was room for both.\nOrioles to host ‘Thanks Brooks Day’ on September 24 (Orioles.com)I’ve heard that the original Thanks Brooks Day in 1977 was a fun time.\nHyde explains plan for Wells (plus other notes) (School of Roch)Manager Brandon Hyde broke down everything that went into yesterday’s pitching decisions in his pre-game remarks. That was a lot of juggling that didn’t end up mattering all that much since the offense only got three hits.\nBirthdays and Orioles anniversaries\nToday in 2012, the Orioles beat the Yankees to pull into a tie for the AL East lead. However, during the 5-4 win, CC Sabathia hit Nick Markakis with a pitch that broke Markakis’s thumb, ending his season. Would the next month’s ALDS have played out differently with a healthy Markakis, who was the 2012 Orioles team’s highest OBP player? I guess we’ll never know.\nThere are a few former Orioles who were born on this day. They are: 2014 catcher Nick Hundley, 1985-86 catcher Al Pardo, 1956 one-game pitcher George Werley, and 1958 six-game pitcher Lou Sleater.\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday to you! Your birthday buddies for today include: Battle of Gettysburg hero Joshua Chamberlain (1828), composer Antonín Dvořák (1841), actor Peter Sellers (1925), country artist Patsy Cline (1932), civil rights activist Ruby Bridges (1954), and singer-songwriter Pink (1979).\nOn this day in history...\nIn 1504, the sculpture David by Michelangelo was unveiled in Florence. You can still find it in Florence today, though it was moved from its original public plaza into an art museum in 1873. A replica has stood at the original spot since 1910.\nIn 1900, a hurricane struck Galveston, Texas. The hurricane killed between 6,000 and 12,000 people and left nearly a quarter of the surviving population homeless.\nIn 1945, the partition of Korea began, with American troops arriving in the southern part of the country in response to Soviet occupation of the north the previous month.\nIn 1966, Star Trek aired its first episode, “Man Trap”.\n**\nAnd that’s the way it is in Birdland on September 8. Have a safe Thursday.",

        "description": "Photo by Cliff Welch/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Since returning from the IL, Story has been hitting anything and everything, supplying some fun as the Red Sox play out the string before entering a critical offseason.  This is the too little too late part of the season for the Boston Red Sox. As fun as it was for fans to see them sweep the Texas Rangers last weekend and have their longest win streak since the end of June, their chances of making the playoffs are minuscule at this point, and that’s putting it rather lightly. To wit, prior to games on Wednesday, FanGraphs gave them a 0.3 percent chance of making the playoffs. Yikes. \nBut while the overall season is circling the drain, there is still some fun to be had, even some that doesn’t revolve around finally getting to see Triston Casas take on MLB pitching. In the last couple weeks, Trevor Story has provided quite a bit of that aforementioned fun, as he has been nearly unstoppable since returning from the injured list at the end of August. \nBefore he came back into the lineup on Aug. 27, Story had last played on July 12, a week before the All-Star Game and several more before the Juan Soto blockbuster. Wow, that was a while ago, wasn’t it? Anyway, prior to his recent stint on the IL, Story had been merely OK in the first few months of his maiden season with the Red Sox after signing a six-year, $140 million deal a few weeks before the regular season got started. With a 93 wRC+ prior to his injury that was buoyed by a spike of power production in May, it was still far too early to label Story a bust, but it wasn’t great for the Red Sox’s biggest free agent signing of the offseason (and the Chaim Bloom era) to be struggling to keep his head above water offensively. \nMaybe a little rest is all Story needed, though, because he has looked like an entirely new player over the last week and a half. With the mandatory qualifiers about sample size and such, this is the Story the Red Sox hoped they signed earlier this spring. Even including an 0-for-4 night on Tuesday, in 37 plate appearances since coming off the IL, Story has slashed .400/.432/.629 for an even 200 wRC+. He’s also had six extra-base hits, driven in five and even stolen a couple bases. Obviously Story isn’t going to bat .400 the rest of the reason or be 100 percent better than league average as a hitter. After all, mixed in with those impressive stats is a still very high strikeout rate, a meager walk rate and pretty middling contact metrics in terms of hard hit rate, average exit velocity and barrel rate. In addition, Story’s batting average on balls in play during this recent stretch is sitting at a ludicrous .565. Still, we can all agree the last week has been fun when Story has been hitting. \n  \n        \n      Photo By Winslow Townson/Getty Images\n  \nSuch a heater is reminiscent of what the Red Sox starting second baseman did back in May, when he clobbered nine home runs across 120 plate appearances, including a seven-game stretch of seven dingers in the middle of the month. Unfortunately, that torrid pace fell off in the next few months, with Story hitting only six home runs across 148 combined plate appearances in June and July, with his overall production falling to 24 percent below league average in that time. For comparison, he was 29 percent better than league average at the plate during May. \nSo the pattern we’re seeing develop here is one of a streaky hitter prone to strung out stretches of struggles mixed with sizzling samples of superpowered slugging. But is that what we should expect from Story based on his pre-Boston days? Before last season, the answer would more or less be no. Between 2016 and 2020, Story posted a below average wRC+ for a month only eight times (out 25 months), with a few of those months combining production in March and April and/or September and October. Of those eight instances, only three occurred from 2018 to 2020, making for 12 months with a wRC+ above 100 across a sample of 15 months. While monthly wRC+ isn’t exactly a scientifically perfect way to measure a hitter’s streakiness, it at least sheds some light on Story’s consistency during that time. \nIn 2021, however, Story was a bit more prone to offensive fluctuations from month to month. From March through May, he hovered in the mid-80s in terms of wRC+ while hitting five home runs. He finally got going in June with a 117 wRC+, before going into a deep funk in July (58 wRC+). The seesaw reversed course from there, with Story producing a 125 wRC+ the rest of the way (133 in August and 117 in September and October). In all, the uneven distribution didn’t make Story any less of a marquee free agent, but it did create at least a little bit of uncertainty. \nThe up-and-down trajectory has continued in 2022, doing little to quell any lingering doubt, with Story producing a wRC+ of 129 in May and a combined mark of 200 in August and September, which have been weighed down by marks below 80 in the other months of the year. \nWhen you put it all together, Story has clawed his way above average offensively, although just barely at a 104 wRC+. That would be perfectly fine if he were a platoon infielder, but it looks like more of a disappointment when placed in the context of Story’s starpower and paycheck. However, disappointment is certainly too strong a word at this juncture. (Who decided to use that word anyway? Oh right, I did.)\nBuoyed by his usually strong defense and the sparks of offensive success he has had, Story is still on his way to a roughly three-win season, which is pretty good considering he missed more than a month of the year and has regressed a bit offensively. We also have to remember that he didn’t sign with the Red Sox until very late in the offseason, giving him precious little time to acclimate to a new team at the beginning of the year. These may seem like excuses, and I suppose they are, but what Story’s recent hot streak has shown us is that in a year that’s been tough to evaluate, he has clearly shown he can still be a superstar. He just needs to do it more consistently. \n  \n        \n      Photo by Nick Cammett/Diamond Images via Getty Images\n  \nBut that’s not the only thing up in the air as it relates to Story. When the Red Sox signed an All-Star shortstop last spring, it raised red flags about what it meant for Xander Bogaerts’ future with the team. The short-term solution this year was to shift Story over to second base while allowing Bogaerts, an All-Star shortstop himself, to stay at his post. While there were never any rumblings of animosity between Bogaerts and Story, it would be naive to ignore the addition of Story in the context of the ongoing contract negotiations saga between Bogaerts and the Red Sox. \nTechnically speaking, Bogaerts is signed through 2026. So what’s the problem? Well, for those who have tried to ignore all this with the hopes that it would all work itself out (I envy you), Bogaerts has an opt-out clause following this very year. It’s been assumed for nearly a year that Bogaerts will use said opt-out clause to test free agency, and with the Red Sox failing to work out an extension to his liking, that still seems like the path Bogaerts will take. \nNow, that doesn’t mean the Red Sox might not re-sign him this offseason (and it will be no sooner than that), but adding Story complicated the calculus for both sides. If Story continues his late season surge through the end of the campaign, it might get even more complicated. It likely it won’t have a huge effect, of course. It would be foolish to make such a major contract decision with a homegrown star based on a few games, and even if Chaim Bloom has not exactly won over the Red Sox fanbase, he’s not going to make that mistake. However, if Story was actually brought in as insurance for if Bogaerts left or to replace him because Boston wasn’t interested in pursuing a long-term deal, seeing him produce like he has the last couple weeks certainly won’t change the minds of those in the front office. \nIt feels callous to look at a positive on the field like Story’s recent offensive run in such a callous light. An optimist would see Story succeed and be excited about the future, as it would be insane for a team with the financial resources of the Red Sox to opt for one offensively gifted middle infielder when it could have two. But as the Red Sox have shown over the last few years with moves like the Mookie Betts trade, there is no room for sentiment in the front office. \nSo as not to leave you on such a dire-sounding note, let’s veer back to the fun Story has provided recently and watch his three-run home run from last Sunday. We can worry about the rest later. \n\n\nComing in HOT. pic.twitter.com/1BvVvPCFAA— Red Sox (@RedSox) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\nNote: All statistics are from before games on Sept. 7",

        "description": "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made an unscheduled visit to Kyiv on Thursday as the Biden administration announced major new military aid worth more than $2 billion for Ukraine and other European countries threatened by Russia.In meetings with senior Ukrainian officials, Blinken said the Biden administration had notified Congress of its intent to provide $2 billion in long-term Foreign Military Financing to Ukraine and 18 of its neighbors, including NATO members and regional security partners, that are “most potentially at risk for future Russian aggression.&quot;Pending expected congressional approval, about $1 billion of that will go to Ukraine and the rest will be divided among Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia, the State Department said.It will go to help those countries “deter and defend against emergent threats to their sovereignty and territorial integrity&quot; by enhancing their military integration with NATO and countering “Russian influence and aggression,&quot; the department said.“This assistance demonstrates yet again our unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s future as a democratic, sovereign, and independent state, as well as the security of allies and partners across the region,” it said.Foreign Military Financing, or FMF, allows recipients to purchase U.S.-made defense equipment, often depending on their specific needs.The financing comes on top of a $675 million package of heavy weaponry, ammunition and armored vehicles for Ukraine alone that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced earlier Thursday at a conference in Ramstein, Germany.That package includes howitzers, artillery munitions, Humvees, armored ambulances, anti-tank systems and more.Austin said that “the war is at another key moment,” with Ukrainian forces beginning their counteroffensive in the south of the country. He said that “now we’re seeing the demonstrable success of our common efforts on the battlefield.”“The face of the war is changing and so is the mission of this contact group,” Austin told the meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which was attended by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukraine’s defense minister as well as officials from allied countries.Germany and the Netherlands will provide training in demining to Ukrainian soldiers as well as demining equipment, the countries’ defense ministers said on the sidelines of the meeting with Austin. The training will be carried out in Germany. The two countries previously joined forces to send howitzers to Ukraine.Thursday&#x27;s contributions bring total U.S. aid to Ukraine to $15.2 billion since Biden took office. U.S. officials said the new commitments were intended to show that American support for the country in the face of Russia&#x27;s invasion is unwavering.The announcements came as fighting between Ukraine and Russia has intensified in recent days, with Ukrainian forces mounting a counteroffensive to retake Russian-held areas in the south and east.Shelling has continued near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe&#x27;s largest, with the warring sides trading blame again amid dire warnings from the U.N. atomic watchdog for the creation of a safe zone to prevent a catastrophe.On Wednesday, the U.S. accused Moscow of interrogating, detaining and forcibly deporting hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to Russia. Russian officials immediately rejected the claim as “fantasy.&quot;In Kyiv before meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Blinken visited the U.S. embassy and then the National Specialized Children’s Hospital Ohmatdyt, where he saw boys and girls injured during Russian bombardments, including Maryna, a 6-year-old from the city of Kherson who lost a leg after a rocket struck her house.In the hospital lobby, Blinken also met “Patron,” a Jack Russell terrier that has helped Ukraine’s military find more than 200 mines laid by Russian forces. Blinken kneeled down, petted the dog and presented it with treats, saying the canine was “world famous.”In one ward, Blinken brought a basket of stuffed animals, which the children quickly dangled in front of Patron to get his attention.Blinken told parents that “the spirit of your children sends a very strong message around the world.”",

        "description": "The Yankees swept a doubleader from Minnesota by throwing a team from the 90s at the Twins — as in uniform numbers usually limited to spring training.“It doesn&#x27;t matter if our big guys are here or they&#x27;re not,” Aaron Judge said after hitting his major league-leading 55th home run Wednesday to start the first of two rallies that carried New York to 5-4 and 7-1 wins. “We walk out there, we&#x27;ve got the pinstripes, we&#x27;re wearing the NY, and every single guy that walks in this clubhouse is going to get the job done.”Isiah Kiner-Falefa, playing third base for the first time in two years, sparked a two-run 12th inning in the opener with a tying leadoff single and hit a go-ahead grand slam in the fourth inning of the nightcap.IKF sent a belt-high slider from Joe Ryan (10-8) into the left-field seats and flipped his bat after the no-doubt drive, his first slam among 19 career home runs.“Last year I was on a 100-loss team,” Kiner-Falefa said. “Whatever it takes to win, that&#x27;s all I care about.”Oswaldo Cabrera stopped an 0-for-25 slide with a game-ending single in the opener.Giancarlo Stanton, Anthony Rizzo, DJ LeMahieu, Josh Donaldson, Andrew Benintendi and Matt Carpenter were among those hurt or unavailable.Judge (No. 99) was joined by Nos. 95 (Cabrera), 91 (shortstop Oswald Peraza), 97 (reliever Ron Marinaccio) and 90 (center fielder Estevan Florial) to give the Yankees five players with jerseys in the 90s. Greg Weissert (3-0), who won the opener, had a relatively low No. 85.Peraza got his first four big league hits in the doubleheader, including a pair of doubles. Cabrera threw out Gilberto Celestino at the plate in the 10th inning, his fifth outfield assist since his Aug. 17 debut, and made a sliding catch on Gio Urshela.“When we&#x27;ve seen what Oswaldo Cabrera has done on the defensive side of the ball or with big hits, that&#x27;s provided some energy,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said, going on to also cite Peraza and Florial. “Those are things that I think create energy, when young, talented players come up and play like they belong.”Gerrit Cole (11-7) struck out a season-high 14 in the night game, allowing five hits and two walks in 6 2/3 innings. Carlos Correa hit a third-inning homer, and with the crowd chanting “Cheater!&quot; in the seventh, Correa struck out to strand two runners against Lucas Luetge, who went 2 1/3 innings for his second save. Aaron Hicks added a three-run double in the eighth after Austin Davis walked the Nos. 7-9 hitters.New York (83-54) opened a five-game AL East lead over second-place Tampa Bay and clinched its 30th straight winning season. The Yankees are 114-39 against the Twins since 2002, including the playoffs.Judge homered for the fourth straight game, driving a changeup to left in the fourth inning, the only blemish of Louie Varland’s otherwise outstanding major league debut. Judge set the Yankees record for right-handed hitters by surpassing the 54 homers hit by Alex Rodriguez in 2007.Varland, a 24-year-old right-hander, gave up three hits and one walk in 5 1/3 innings with seven strikeouts. He averaged 93.9 mph with 44 fastballs, mixing in 19 changeups and 17 sliders.“I’m glad it’s over because there’s a lot of anxiety,” the St. Paul native said. “I couldn’t really feel my legs the first batter. After that first out though, things kind of went back to normal.&quot;Judge struck out on a changeup in the first.&quot;The perfect one to do my first strikeout,&quot; Varland said.Twenty-three family members and friends were on hand, visible on the third base side in a sparse crowd for the makeup of Tuesday&#x27;s rainout.“It’s like watching a movie. We’re just floating around. He deserves this so much,” said his mom, Kim. “It’s overwhelming joy. He’s been a fan forever and to get the hometown team is amazing, amazing.”Minnesota, which dropped two games behind AL Central-leading Cleveland, had built a 3-0 lead when Jose Miranda hit a two-run homer inside the left-field foul pole in the first and Celestino had an RBI single in the third. Gleyber Torres tied it with a two-run homer in the sixth off Griffin Jax.After Celestino’s RBI single off Marinaccio gave Minnesota a 4-3 lead in the 12th, Weissert retired Correa on a popout and Miranda on a flyout.Kiner-Falefa singled off Trevor Megill (3-3), stole second with one out and scored when Cabrera grounded a curve for an opposite-field, two-out single to left that ended a 4-hour, 3-minute struggle.“They&#x27;re cool, calm and collected,” Judge said of the kids. “I don&#x27;t see them up there timid. They&#x27;re not scared.”WinningNew York&#x27;s streak of winning seasons is second only to the big league record of 39 set by the Yankees from 1926-64.DefenseMinnesota made a season-high four errors in the opener.

        "description": "(Epic)The irrepressible rocker offsets his usual forays into the occult with moving contemplations of illness on a star-studded return‘I’ll never die, because I’m immortal,” sings Ozzy Osbourne on the second track of his 13th solo album. It’s not the last time Patient Number 9 mentions cheating death: “I’m coming out of my grave … you’re going to see my face,” he sings on No Escape from Now, while One of Those Days has him “killing myself – but I never die”. You could say all this seems par for the course, more of the supernatural hokum that has been part of the Ozzy Osbourne brand since Black Sabbath first appeared. There’s a lot of said hokum here, albeit with its tongue more obviously lodged in its cheek than it was 50 odd years ago: Patient Number 9 is an album that comes decorated with pantomime villain cackles, grown men’s voices crying “Mummy! Mummy!” in fear and what sounds like the bad guy in a campy horror flick shouting, “Somebody stop me!” A song that mentions decomposition, meanwhile, concludes with the words, “I loike worms,” in a thick Brummie accent.You can understand why Osbourne might be preoccupied with cheating death or rising from the grave in 2022. It’s not just that he has been plagued by health problems in recent years – Parkinson’s disease and surgeries after a fall at home and to combat nerve pain among them – it’s that every project Osbourne has involved himself in recently has had an air of finality about it. A farewell tour, a reunion album with Black Sabbath motivated by concluding his career with the band “in the right way”, a subsequent Sabbath tour called The End: even Osbourne’s last solo album, 2020’s Ordinary Man, was reviewed as if it was his last. But here he is, two years on and reunited with Ordinary Man producer Andrew Watt, who’s audibly a fan and thoroughly enjoying himself, slathering on the Planet Caravan-esque vocal effects during No Escape from Now and getting Eric Clapton to play on One of Those Days in a wah-pedal heavy style that’s, thrillingly, closer to his work with Cream than his solo oeuvre.

Well, a duo from Arbroath have got 13 hot tracks – translated from ultrasonic frequencies – just for youHanna Tuulikki is inviting you to a bat rave: a party in the setting September sun, propelled by pulsing beats and lights. All being well, above your head will flit superskilled flying mammals – common and soprano pipistrelles, Daubenton’s bats – dining on insects attracted by your body heat. The bats have provided the tunes, too: an album of 13 dance tracks written by Tuulikki with Tommy Perman, all mixed from sampled echolocation calls from 14 species found in the UK.Bat calls are ultrasonic – beyond the range of the human ear. The sounds Tuulikki and Perman used were recorded from a heterodyne bat detector, which translates them to audible frequencies. Hearing pipistrelle calls through a bat detector for the first time a few years ago Tuulikki was “struck by how much they reminded me of the Roland TB-303 synthesiser from the 1980s”. The squelching sounds of the 303 were foundational to acid house and techno: why not make dance music from bat echolocator calls? Continue reading...",

a courageous Russian soldier tells all about the war against Ukraine. Pavel Filatyev is a 33-year-old paratrooper who wrote an explosive memoir, “Zov” (Call), that appeared in early August. Filatyev exposes the war as an act of Russian aggression, shows that most Russian soldiers are hungry, dirty and demoralized, and savagely criticizes the Russian generals and officers. His exposé rings true, if only because it is identical to the one proffered by Ukrainian and Western policymakers, journalists, analysts and generals.\n\n\n\nFilatyev starts by describing the first “two months of filth, hunger, sweat, and the feeling of being next to death. It’s too bad that they don’t allow reporters to us in the frontlines, since the entire country could then admire the hairy paratroopers, dirty, filthy, thin; it was unclear who they were angrier at — the stubborn Ukrainians who don’t want to de-Nazify or their own incompetent commanders incapable of providing supplies even during combat. Half of my boys dressed and wore Ukrainian uniforms because they were of better quality and comfort, while ours were worn out since our great country was unable to dress, equip, and feed its own army.” He continues in this vein throughout the entire text, sparing no criticism of Russian military institutions. Unsurprisingly, morale is low: “An atmosphere of apathy rules over the contract soldiers, 90 percent of whom discuss ways to end their contracts as soon as possible.”\n\n\n\nFilatyev dismisses the regime’s justifications for the war. It can’t be Ukraine’s NATO aspirations, because Russia wages no war with its other NATO neighbors. It can’t be that Ukraine would have attacked if Russia hadn’t, he says, since “how could a country that has difficulty defending itself … attack us?” It can’t be that the Ukrainians are Nazis who oppress Russians, as he hasn’t heard of a single instance of Russians being persecuted for their language or culture in Ukraine. Nor, finally, can it be that the self-styled republics in Donetsk and Luhansk needed Russian protection from supposed Ukrainian Nazis hell-bent on destroying therm.\n\n\n\n“Don’t we have enough territory?” Filtayev asks rhetorically.\n\n\n\nFilatyev ends his memoir on a less than hopeful note:\n\n\n\n“I fought in Ukraine, and if I don’t have the right to say, ‘no to war,’ then who has the right to start it? I cannot return our army home, but I can relate my experience and my thoughts about participating in this war and call on my co-citizens to concern themselves with their own country, which has so many of its own problems. … The people are afraid and do not want to state their position and influence policy. It’s a vicious circle. We are all guilty, but it’s necessary to reach some conclusions and begin to correct our fall.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFilatyev then assumes an almost pathetic tone: “Where is the breadth of the Russian soul? Where are our nobility and spirituality? I cannot believe that we have again become enslaved serfs. After all, our ancestors shed so much of their own blood for freedom. Perhaps nothing will change things, but I will not participate in this madness.”\n\n\n\nIn an interview with a Russian opposition website, Filatyev emphasizes the lies on which Vladimir Putin’s war is based. “I don’t see in the trenches the children of Skabeyeva, Solovyov, Kiselev, Rogozin, Lavrov, and Medvedev” — the first three being Russian propagandists, the latter three being top policymakers — “even as I continually hear their calls to kill.” Fortunately, the soldiers appear to understand the mendacity and hypocrisy of the regime and its spokespersons, he says. “The Russian army does not want to fight. Not because it’s afraid, but because it understands that the government has dragged it into a fatal war. It’s a problematic war, in which there is no truth. Most Russian soldiers don’t feel that truth is on their side.”\n\n\n\nFilatyev then turns apocalyptic: “For many it will be hard to recognize the truth and the fact that we liberated no one, but simply destroyed cities and killed many people. But when they do realize this, then there’ll be a collapse.”\n\n\n\nOf the regime, of course.\n\n\n\nAlexander J. Motyl is a professor of political science at Rutgers University-Newark.

        "description": "Ukrainian officials, defending their country against Russian aggressors, began doing something in July that seemed odd, even counterintuitive: They started speaking loudly and regularly about their plans to liberate Kherson—a key southern city that Russia seized only a week after invading Ukraine on February 24. Indeed, the Ukrainians telegraphed their intentions in a way that the Russians could not mistake. This was like waving a red cape at an angry, incompetent bull. Almost immediately, rumors proliferated that the Russians were racing reinforcements to Kherson to prepare for the Ukrainian attack.Goading the Russians into doing so seems to have been the Ukrainians’ exact goal. Fighting in Kherson plays to Ukrainian strength far more than to the Russians’. Russian occupiers in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas, where the war had been concentrated from April until July, can operate very close to the Russian border, seem to have solidly functional rail lines, and are currently trying to pressure the Ukrainians from two sides at the tip of the fighting around the town of Siversk. Fighting in Kherson, by contrast, nullifies almost all of Russia’s advantages in the Donbas. The Russians are at the edge of their supply lines, while the Ukrainians can maneuver around them. Kherson is deeper into Ukraine than the Donbas, so Russian aircraft have farther to travel to reach the front lines, and that clearly makes them nervous; they prefer to fly mostly over Russia itself or its ally Belarus. Finally, the entire Russian fighting force in Kherson depends for its supplies on just a small number of bridges that span the wide Dnipro River. In recent weeks, the Ukrainians have attacked those crossings almost nightly, severely hindering Russia from moving supplies to their hard-pressed troops in Kherson. The longer the Russians have to fight with limited supplies, the more the battle will turn in Ukraine’s favor.Though Vladimir Putin had the reputation of a strategic genius when he started this war six months ago, the Ukrainians have exposed him as a plodding and unimaginative thinker who miscalculated enormously. Since then he has resorted to ponderous, unthinking offensives that have secured minimal gains at a very high cost. The Russian army, wildly overrated before the war by military analysts who hailed it as one of the most fast-moving, technologically sophisticated, and powerful in the world, turns out to be profoundly flawed. With ever-changing carousels of generals in charge, it has shown itself to be inflexible, uncreative, and unable to learn.[Phillips Payson O’Brien: How the West got Russia’s military so, so wrong]Ukraine has been on a more impressive trajectory. At the start of the war, the Ukrainians fought a surprisingly strong defensive struggle around Kyiv. Using attacks on Russian logistics and a strategy of denying the Russians access to Ukrainian cities, stringing Russian forces along the roads, and contesting the control of the air, they neutered the Russian drive on Kyiv in just a few weeks. Since then, the Ukrainian military has demonstrated the ability to adapt and develop new ways of countering the Russians. The sinking of the Moskva, the expulsion of the Russians from Snake Island, and the strikes on Russian facilities in occupied Crimea, an area previously thought too difficult to attack, show that the Ukrainians can plan and undertake missions requiring the operation of complex systems.The challenge the Ukrainians now face is their most difficult one yet. They are attempting to liberate a large swath of land on the west bank of the Dnipro River, anchored by Kherson but stretching almost 100 miles in length and about 30 miles in width. The Ukrainians’ new offensive is a far grander and more complex operation than anything they have previously undertaken. They are trying to neutralize a large Russian force equipped with large stores of heavy weaponry, much of it just rushed to the Kherson region in preparation for the Ukrainian attack.Since World War II, the advance of large armored forces has been based on control of the skies. The Ukrainians, though they are showing surprising ability in this area, are still battling the Russians for air supremacy. Moreover, Ukraine must move forward into territory now held by the enemy, rather than defend its own position. For almost all of the war, the Russians have been on the offensive. This has allowed the Ukrainians to use defensive firepower on them with great effectiveness. Recently, the number of photographically confirmed Russian-tank losses surpassed 1,000. The real figure is likely closer to 2,000; much of the destruction for the past few months has occurred in Russian-controlled territory, making photographic proof much more difficult to come by. Indeed, one could argue that the evolution of war, with the improvement of handheld anti-vehicle weapons and smaller drones, has given the defender important new advantages that make advancing extremely risky.The Ukrainians seem to understand all of this. So far they have built a different kind of offensive in Kherson—one that could hold lessons for the future of war. What they have not done is prepare for the kind of operation that many were expecting the Russians to launch in February: a large-scale, fast-moving war in which armored units break through enemy lines and exploit the opening by moving quickly forward and cutting off or surrounding enemy forces. In the first week of this latest phase of the battle, launched on August 29, the Ukrainians have liberated just a handful of villages. But even though the front line has shifted only marginally, the Ukrainians are positioning themselves for a significant victory.[From the October 2022 issue: Ukrainians are defending the values Americans claim to hold]They have done this by patiently preparing the ground for success over the previous months. First, the United States and other NATO countries seemed persuaded, after seeing the tenacity and smarts that underlay the Ukrainian defense, to provide a great deal of intelligence information. The Ukrainians could thus gather a more complete picture of the logistics situation of the Russian army. Of course, they needed to translate this information into action, and for that they needed to improve the accuracy, range, and overall effectiveness of their artillery and rocket-launch systems. The Ukrainians went into the war mostly relying on old Russian or Soviet equipment, starved as they were of higher-quality NATO standard equipment by Western governments that discounted their country’s chances in a conventional war with Russia. Since then, however, the Ukrainians’ strength, resolution, and ingenuity have led the United States and other NATO countries to provide far superior weaponry. These include a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which, despite being relatively old for the American military, has shown itself in Ukrainian hands to be considerably better than any Russian equivalent. Since the Ukrainians first deployed HIMARS, at the end of June, they have methodically targeted Russian supply depots, greatly constraining the invaders’ ability to move forward.Even more recently, Ukraine has started operating high-speed anti-radiation missiles, which take out enemy radar and seem to be playing havoc with Russian anti-aircraft defenses. This has allowed the Ukrainians to more fruitfully use drones, including the Turkish-made Bayraktars that seem to be exacting a heavy toll on Russian forces in Kherson.As such, even with the announcements of the Ukrainians’ transition to a more intense phase of the Battle of Kherson on August 29, we have not seen major attempts to push tanks through the Russian lines. Instead, we have seen Ukrainians probing up and down the line, trying to assess the location and strength of Russian forces, attack weak spots, advance cautiously, and, most of all, continue the regular attrition of Russian forces. This kind of warfare—which involves building up offensive capability, tempting the enemy to rush defensive forces in, and then destroying those forces—moves slowly, and it does not resemble many analysts’ view of how modern war looks. But it plays to Ukrainian strengths while magnifying Russian losses.Exactly how long the renewed Battle of Kherson will continue is tricky to say. Even if Ukraine is relatively successful, this phase of accelerated attrition might last for several weeks; even if Russian forces collapse in some places, they may prove harder to dislodge from others. However, as long as the Ukrainians can cut off Russian traffic across the Dnipro and use their superior systems to wear down Russian forces, they stand an excellent chance of driving them out of the west bank of the river. This would be the war’s most important victory since the Battle of Kyiv.",

        "description": "Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Today’s Marlins news roundup also includes Miguel Rojas’ message to his critics. Marlins Podcast Episodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday’s minor league scores: Triple-A Jacksonville lost, 3-1; Double-A Pensacola was postponed due to weather; High-A Beloit lost, 4-3; Low-A Jupiter lost, 7-0. Braxton Garrett (Jacksonville) was sharp in his rehab start, completing 3 1⁄3 quality innings on 46 pitches. Eli Villalobos has now gone 16 straight relief appearances without allowing an earned run. Making his full-season debut, Jacob Miller (Jupiter) allowed one unearned run while striking out three in a two-inning start.\nFor the first time since June 2021, Trevor Rogers has lasted six innings in back-to-back starts.\nFrom Miguel Rojas on Twitter: “Just because you have an opinion, doesn’t mean that opinion matters !! We already play a game of failure to be dealing with ppl telling you what you can’t do. Tough times really shows you who is there for you and who is just kissing [ass].” I transcribed the text just in case any of you have been blocked by Rojas on Twitter like Fish Stripes was.\nFanGraphs gives the Marlins a 50.1% chance to win their series finale against the Phillies. The Fish are in the midst of their longest losing streak since 2013, only three defeats away from setting a new franchise record in that department.\nFish Stripes’ own Noah Berger is traveling with the team in Philadelphia. He floats the possibility that Brian Anderson could be receiving reps in the infield in the near future. Anderson has been used exclusively in the corner outfield spots since returning from the injured list last month.\nThe Yankees’ two-decade dominance of the Twins continued with a doubleheader sweep, during which Aaron Judge socked his 55th home run of the season.\nThe newest open position posted to the Marlins’ job board is Chief of Staff, who will be reporting to COO Caroline O’Connor.\nInterested in a pair of good tickets to Saturday’s Colombian Heritage Celebration? Contact Marlins Tailgate.\nOnce Fish On The Farm reaches 7,000 followers on Twitter, they’re giving away an autographed Trevor Rogers card. Enter to win today!

        "description": "A new treatment that combines cytokine &#8220;drug factory&#8221; implants with a checkpoint inhibitor drug eradicates advanced-stage mesothelioma tumors in mice in just a few days, a new study shows.\nResearchers administered the drug-producing beads, which are no larger than the head of a pin, next to tumors where they could produce continuous, high doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2), a natural compound that activates white blood cells to fight cancer.\n&#8220;From the beginning, our objective was to develop a platform therapy that can be used for multiple different types of immune system disorders or different types of cancers,&#8221; says Amanda Nash, a graduate student at Rice University who spent several years developing the implant technology with study co-lead author Samira Aghlara-Fotovat, a fellow student in the lab of bioengineer Omid Veiseh.\nThe cytokine factories consist of alginate beads loaded with tens of thousands of cells that are genetically engineered to produce natural IL-2, one of two cytokines the FDA has approved for treatment of cancer.\n&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;ve not seen these mesothelioma tumors in mice be eradicated, with such efficacy, as we have in this mouse model.&#8221;\nThe factories are just 1.5 millimeters wide and can be implanted with minimally invasive surgery to deliver high doses of IL-2 directly to tumors. In the mesothelioma study, researchers placed the beads beside tumors and inside the thin layer of tissue known as the pleura, which covers the lungs and lines the interior wall of the chest.\n&#8220;I take care of patients who have malignant pleural mesothelioma,&#8221; says Bryan Burt, professor and chief of the thoracic surgery division at Baylor University. &#8220;This is a very aggressive malignancy of the lining of the lungs. And it&#8217;s very hard to treat completely by surgical resection.\n&#8220;In other words, there is often residual disease that is left behind. The treatment of this residual disease with local immunotherapy—the local delivery of relatively high doses of immunotherapy to that pleural space—is a very attractive way to treat this disease.&#8221;\nVeiseh says the mesothelioma study began when Burt and Ravi Ghanta, an associate professor at Baylor, heard about the early results of ovarian cancer animal tests Veiseh&#8217;s team was conducting with collaborators at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\nIn March, Veiseh and MD Anderson collaborators published a study showing IL-2-producing beads could eradicate advanced-stage ovarian and colorectal tumors in mice in less than a week.\n&#8220;They were really impressed by the preclinical data we had in ovarian cancer,&#8221; Veiseh says of Burt and Ghanta. &#8220;And they asked the question, &#8216;Could we actually leverage the same system for mesothelioma?'&#8221;\nMesothelioma refers to any cancer that occurs in the tissue linings that surround and protect internal organs. About 80% of mesothelioma cases are linked to prolonged exposure to asbestos.\nImmunotherapy with drugs called checkpoint inhibitors has met with some success in treating mesothelioma. Checkpoint inhibitors don&#8217;t kill cancer directly but rather by training the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells.\nIn the mesothelioma study, the researchers tested Veiseh&#8217;s drug factory implants both by themselves and in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor that targeted the PD-1 protein. They found the drug factory implants eliminated tumors in more than 50% of the treated animals when used by themselves.\nTumors were destroyed completely in all seven mice that were treated with both the drug factory implants and PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s very hard to treat mesothelioma tumors in mice, like it is in human beings,&#8221; says Burt. &#8220;And what our data show is that delivery of these immunotherapy particles, regionally, to these mice who have mesothelioma, has very provocative and very effective treatment responses. In fact, I&#8217;ve not seen these mesothelioma tumors in mice be eradicated, with such efficacy, as we have in this mouse model.&#8221;\nThe results also suggest that the combination of IL-2-producing implants and anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors could be effective at training &#8220;memory T cells&#8221; that can reactivate the immune system to fight mesothelioma if it recurs, Veiseh says.\n&#8220;We have a spinout company, Avenge Bio, that recently received clearance from the FDA to treat ovarian cancer patients, and in the next couple of months they expect to begin treating patients with these IL-2 cytokine factories,&#8221; Veiseh says.\n&#8220;The preclinical data reported in our latest manuscript helped justify initiating a second clinical trial for patients suffering from mesothelioma and other lung cancers with pleural metastasis,&#8221; Veiseh says. &#8220;We have held meetings with the FDA and expect to initiate a second trial for this patient population in the latter half of 2023.&#8221;\nIn addition to the cancer research, Veiseh and Ghanta have received a grant from the American Heart Association to study the cytokine implants&#8217; potential for healing heart injuries caused by heart attacks.\nThe study is published in Clinical Cancer Research. The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health funded the work.\nSource: Rice University\nThe post Tiny &#8216;drug factory&#8217; quickly destroys tumors in mice appeared first on Futurity.",

The Philadelphia hardcore quartet, making their UK debut in the wake of their stellar debut Diaspora Problems, evidently want to make a mark. And that they do – certainly in heat. Within two songs, the air is heavy with moisture, and drummer TJ Stevenson has stripped to the waist. “Do you think I’m sweating?” he asks the crowd.“Those are tears,” counters Jordan. “We’re crying from every pore of our bodies.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "Dan Brink\n    \n\n  Judge’s home run streak ended, but his pace is still looking strong. Welcome back to the Aaron Judge Home Run Record Tracker! We’re taking a daily look at where Aaron Judge’s monster season tracks compared to some of the other historic single-season home run leaders in anticipation of Judge potentially joining their ranks. We’ll be going by Team Game because not every player’s seasons were in sync with the calendar days and everyone didn’t play all of the team’s games, which makes this our universal standard. Now, onto Game 137:\nAaron Judge through Game 137 of 2022: 55 HR\nTeam Game 137: 9/7 — 0-for-2, 3 BB, 2 K, 1 SB\nEntering the second half of a doubleheader, Judge had homered in four straight games to jump ahead of Maris’ pace. He wouldn’t get an opportunity in this one though, working three walks as the league continues to be wary of offering him anything unless the situation requires them to pitch to the big man.\nRoger Maris through Game 137 of 1961: 53 HR\nTeam Game 137: 9/4 (1) — 0-for-4\nMaris didn’t have much to offer in this game, generating a couple of pop ups and lining into a double play in his first at-bat of the night. The Yankees were fine without Maris cranking one out, scoring in four of their last five frames to secure a 5-3 win over the Senators.\nBabe Ruth through Game 137 of 1927: 49 HR\nTeam Game 137: 9/10 — 0-for-2, 2 BB\nMuch like Judge, Ruth wasn’t allowed many shots to get the ball in the air on this night. The Browns walked the Sultan of Swat twice, and the rest of the Yankee lineup struggled to do much with the respect paid to the league’s top slugger. The team only scored one run, but that would be all they needed behind a seven-hit shutout from Wilcy Moore. Ruth was lifted in the ninth for a defensive replacement, so if Moore had faltered in the end there wouldn’t have even been another chance for the Bambino.\nBarry Bonds through Game 137 of 2001: 57 HR\nTeam Game 137: 9/2 — 0-for-3, 1 BB, 1 K\nFollowing the trend so far, Bonds didn’t get anything to hit in his game either. The Rockies didn’t even avoid him heavily, allowing one walk but otherwise attacking Bonds and getting him to strikeout once. The rest of the Giants were able to scrounge up three runs off of Shawn Chacon and the ‘pen held that lead to put the Giants 15 games above .500.\nMark McGwire through Game 137 of 1998: 55 HR\nTeam Game 137: 8/30 — 3-for-3, 1 HR, 3 RBI, 3 R, 1 BB\nNow we’ve got some intrigue. This day was great for the ‘98 race, and we start with McGwire’s day against Atlanta. McGwire had a solid day entering the seventh inning, when he stepped up to the plate with his team down two and with a pair of runners on with no outs. McGwire mashed a 1-0 Dennis Martinez offering into left-center, a three-run shot that gave him the lead back in the home run race and put the Cardinals ahead for good.\n\nSammy Sosa through Game 137 of 1998: 54 HR\nTeam Game 137: 8/30 — 1-for-3, 1 HR, 2 RBI, 1 R, 1 BB, 1 K, 1 CS\nI say that McGwire had to take back the lead in his game, because in the first inning of the Cubs-Rockies game Sosa tied him with his 54th blast of the year. This one was a two-run bomb that proved crucial, as the Cubs would win this game by a narrow 4-3 final. This would be one of several points in September when Sosa briefly caught up to McGwire before the final push to history.",

The only eligibility requirement was that she continue working for the school.”\n\n\n\n“For Porter, this version of subsidized housing has outlasted her time in the classroom, extending nearly four years after she took unpaid leave from her $258,000-a-year teaching job to serve in the U.S. House.”",

But campaign finance data show that in the first half of this year, the number of people giving federal contributions to Republican candidates and committees through WinRed — the GOP’s widely used donation processing platform — fell to around 913,000 down from roughly 956,000 contributors during the six months prior.”\n\n\n\n“The surprising dip illustrates broader fundraising difficulties that have plagued GOP candidates in key races across the country this summer, even amid hopes that the party could retake control of Congress. It reflects the party’s long-standing challenges in building donor lists to power its campaigns.”",

        "description": "Fresno Grizzlies\n    \n\n  Colorado Rockies news and links for Thursday, September 8th, 2022   First baseman Michael Toglia is in the majors. Shortstop Ezequiel Tovar might still potentially make his big league debut in September. Adael Amador and Yanquiel Fernandez have turned heads in their first minor league seasons with the Low-A Fresno Grizzlies. Fresh faces like Sterlin Thompson and Jordan Beck have emerged from this year’s draft. In the waning days of the 2022 season, the news is abuzz with information about the top prospects of the Colorado Rockies. \nHowever, there is one Rockies prospect I feel to be slipping under the radar much more than he should be, and that’s 22-year old catcher Hunter Goodman.\nHunter Goodman had a strong three-year collegiate career with the University of Memphis Tigers where he put up a career line of .323/.328/.638. He hit 42 home runs over those three seasons with 149 RsBI and stole 22 bases. He hit 21 home runs during his 2021 junior season, after which he was drafted in that year’s MLB Amateur Draft.\nThe Rockies selected Goodman in the fourth found of the 2021 draft, from which he joined the Arizona Complex League Rockies and put up very solid numbers. In 22 games with the ACL Rockies he slashed .300/.419/.517 with two home runs and seven doubles. Goodman would start the 2022 season with the Low-A Fresno Grizzlies, replacing fellow catching prospect Drew Romo as he headed to High-A Spokane. Like the aforementioned Amador and Fernandez, Goodman would be playing his first true minor league season in 2022 with the Grizzlies. Unlike Amador and Fernandez—both of whom are several years younger—Goodman has rocketed up the Rockies minor league system at an extreme speeds.\nGoodman kicked off his season by demolishing the ball in Low-A. His 22 home runs not only still leads the Grizzlies, but it also still stands as the high mark in the California League... which Goodman has been out of for two months. He was promoted to the High-A Spokane Indians in early July. Here is what I said about him at the time:\nproved he was ready to move up by absolutely crushing the ball every chance he got with Low-A Fresno. Goodman slashed an absolutely excellent .291/.368/.592 with a California League leading 22 home runs. Goodman played corner outfield in addition to catcher and first base in college at Memphis, but hasn’t logged any outfield reps in his professional career. He made 48 appearances at first base with Fresno and 24 appearances at catcher. Goodman has the raw power of a bat-first prospect with solid enough speed on the bases for four steals in Fresno. His defense needs work—especially behind the plate—but he has been putting in the time to make improvements with Jerry Weinstein in his corner. He reminds me very favorably of Daulton Varsho of the Arizona Diamondbacks.\nSince moving to High-A, Goodman has done nothing but continue to impress and build upon the success that earned him the initial promotion. In his first month with the Indians, Goodman hit .285/.318/.455 over 123 at-bats with 10 doubles and one triple. However, he wasn’t displaying the power he had been showing off earlier in Low-A. Through those first 31 games he hit only three home runs. Then in mid-August, the power switch was flipped back on. From August 17th through August 26th, Hunter Goodman played nine games and hit a home run in eight of them. Goodman would end the month of August on top, being named the Northwest League’s player of the month after a league-leading 10 home runs and .370 batting average.\n\n\nGoing out on  ! @HunterGoodman35 earns NWL Player of the Month honors for August after batting .370/.405/.769 and leading the league in hits (40), home runs (10), RBI (27), average (.370), total bases (83), slugging percentage (.769) and OPS (1.174). #GoSpo pic.twitter.com/0it25AuNs6— Spokane Indians (@spokaneindians) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nGoodman’s efforts over 49 total games in Spokane earned him yet another promotion. After hitting .315/.351/.589 with 12 home runs he was promoted to the Double-A Hartford Yard Goats on September 6th. Goodman has rocketed up the Rockies farm system, finding himself in Double-A in just one minor league season after starting the year in Low-A. This meteoric rise is cause for celebration, yet he remains unsung. Goodman is ranked the Rockies’ no. 23 prospect per MLB Pipeline with many freshly drafted faces ahead of him. In our preseason PuRPs rankings he came in at no. 27, and only moved up to no. 26 in our recent mid-season rankings.\nWhile it’s true that Goodman is behind defensively compared to his fellow catching prospects like Willie MacIver and Drew Romo, he has made improvements with his work behind the plate. In his 2021 season with the ACL Rockies he had four passed balls in just 12 games as catcher. Across 41 total appearances as a backstop in 2022 he has eight passed balls. Taking that number at face value can be a bit deceiving though. Six of those passed balls came over 24 games with Low-A Fresno, which he left in early July. In 17 games catching for High-A Spokane he had just two passed balls and a 1.000 fielding percentage.\nGoodman still has to put in some work as he improves his catching, but what makes him appealing defensively is his versatility. Goodman has actually played over 200 more innings as a first baseman across the three levels this season than he has as a catcher while posting a .980 fielding percentage. The Rockies could also explore his outfield experience to expand his versatility and playing time—like they have in putting Michael Toglia in right field—if they choose to move him away from catching. \nAs a bat-first prospect, Goodman’s improving defense is more than serviceable as he continues to do what he does best: hit the ball. After his strong offensive marks in Fresno and Spokane, Goodman will likely spend what remains of the 2022 season adapting to Double-A ball, where I predict he’ll start next season—depending on spring training results. In five at-bats with the Yard Goats he is still waiting for his first Double-A hit, but it will come sooner rather than later and will likely have a lot of distance on it.\n★ ★ ★\nAdjustments key for Carlos Estévez in turnaround | Rox Pile\nBullpen arm Carlos Estévez has quietly become one of the Rockies’ better relievers in the second half of the season, and Duane DaPron over at Rox Pile explores the adjustments he went through to make that happen. \n“I found a way to go back to what I do, like stay behind the baseball, get my pitches to move the right way that I want them,” Estévez said. “Once I found that, it’s been really good.”\n★ ★ ★\nOn the Farm\nTriple-A Game 1: El Paso Chihuahuas 6, Albuquerque Isotopes 2\nBrandon Gold gave up four earned runs on three hits and three walks over 1 2⁄3 innings to start game one of the Isotopes’ double header. He was relieved by Ty Blach, who pitched for 4 1⁄3 innings and gave up two runs on five hits. Joel Peguero wrapped things up for ‘Topes pitching with a scoreless seventh and two strikeouts. Jimmy Herron and Sam Hilliard led the offense with individual 2-for-3 games to make up most of Albuquerque’s seven hits, while Herron and LJ Hatch drove in their two runs.\nTriple-A Game 2: El Paso Chihuahuas 7, Albuquerque Isotopes 6\nThe Isotopes had much more offensive success in game two despite the loss thanks to three home runs hit by Sam Hilliard, Jonathan Morales, and DJ Peterson. Hilliard was the standout with a 2-for-3 game and two RsBI. Ashton Goudeau allowed two earned runs on six hits in a four inning start while Julián Fernández pitched two innings of relief. Fernández did give up an earned run but struck out three batters and issued no walks. Unfortunately a likely Isotopes win was spoiled by a rocky Zach Lee-pitched seventh inning. Lee gave up four earned runs on four hits—including a home run—in 2⁄3 innings as the Chihuahuas walked things off.\nDouble-A Game 1: Somerset Patriots 6, Hartford Yard Goats 2\nMitchell Kilkenny had a tough five inning start to kick off game one of the double header, allowing six earned runs on seven hits with three walks. Two of those hits were home runs. Boby Johnson finished the remaining two innings without giving up a run and striking out three batters. The Yard Goats offense scored just two runs on five hits, both of those runs came off a Grant Lavigne home run in the first inning.\nDouble-A Game 2: Somerset Patriots 5, Hartford Yard Goats 0\nThe second game of the double header was a tougher pill to swallow. Patriots pitchers Yoendrys Gomez (five innings) and Steven Jennings (two innings) pitched a combined seven inning no-hitter to blank the Yard Goats. The Yard Goats’ only baserunner was Grant Lavigne, who drew a walk. Will Ethridge took the loss after giving up three earned runs on five hits over four innings, including two home runs. Tony Locey had a difficult inning out of the bullpen, giving up four hits and two earned runs. He did strike out two batters. Austin Kitchen and Dugan Darnell both pitched scoreless innings.\nHigh-A: Spokane Indians 8, Tri-City Dust Devils 3\nThe only Rockies affiliate victory of the day came via the Spokane Indians and their eight runs. Colin Simpson had a 3-for-5 game with an RBI double while Drew Romo went 2-for-4 with an RBI of his own. Cuba Bess hit his first home run with the Indians by way of a two run shot in the second inning. Anderson Amarista put up a quality start with two runs (one earned) given up over 6 2⁄3 innings with five strikeouts. Anderson Bido pitched 1 1⁄3 scoreless innings in relief. Raymells Rosa walked two and gave up an earned run in his inning of work.\nLow-A: San Jose Giants 9, Fresno Grizzlies 3\nJaden Hill worked as the opener for Fresno over 1 1⁄3 innings with one earned run given up on a hit and a walk. He struck out two batters. Cullen Kafka took over and things didn’t go well for him. In four innings he gave up five earned runs on eight hits and walked three batters. Ever Moya gave up one earned run on three hits in his 1 2⁄3 innings of work while Sergio Sanchez gave up two earned runs on three hits. The offensive highlights of the game came from Benny Montgomery and Sterlin Thompson. Montgomery went 2-for-4 with a double and Thompson went 2-for-4 and hit his first Low-A home run—a two run shot in the second inning.\n★ ★ ★\nPlease keep in mind our Purple Row Community Guidelines when you’re commenting.

Kelley ties the National League record for relievers with six consecutive strikeouts.\n1969: The Braves acquire veteran pitchers Hoyt Wilhelm and Bob Priddy from the Angels in exchange for minor league prospects Mickey Rivers and Clint Compton. Hoyt will only stay for a little while as the Braves will waive the knuckleballer to the Cubs in September 1970.\n1975 The Astros outslug the Braves, 9-6, with Jose Sosa picking up his only career win. The loss goes to Frank LaCorte who was making his major league debut.\n1981: Houston’s Cesar Cedeno is fined $5,000 but not suspended after attacking a fan during the Astros’ 3-2 loss to the Braves. Witnesses said that three men in the box seats had been loudly berating Cedeno’s wife and making remarks about the 1973 incident in which he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for the accidental shooting death of a young woman in the Dominican Republic.\n2011: The Braves sweep a doubleheader from the Mets at Citi Field, increasing their lead in the Wild Card race to 7.5 games. A pair of rookies pick up the wins, Mike Minor in the 6-5 defeat of New York in the opener, and Julio Teheran, with his first major league victory, as the Braves prevail, 5-1, in the nightcap.

His 40th home run also breaks Darryl Strawberry’s Mets club record for most homers in a single season.\n1996: A Gary Sheffield 5th-inning home run against the Expos’ Pedro Martinez breaks the major league home run record for a season; the previous record of 4,458 was set 1987.\n1998: Mark McGwire breaks Roger Maris’ single-season home run mark by clouting his 62nd of the year off Steve Trachsel in the 4th inning of the Cardinals’ 6-3 win over the Cubs in St. Louis.\n2008: Gary Sheffield hits a grand slam for the official 250,000th homer in major league history. The blow is Sheffield’s second homer of the day and his 13th career grand slam. Magglio Ordonez, Miguel Cabrera and Mike Hessman also homer as the Tigers outslug the A’s, 14-8.\n2019: The Astros annihilate the Mariners 21-1. Gerrit Cole allows just 1 hit and no walks in eight innings while striking out 15. It is his third straight game of 14+ strikeouts, something accomplished by only one other pitcher since 1908, by Pedro Martinez during his otherworldly 1999 season.

        "description": "Photo by Nic Antaya/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Jackson Holliday had three hits, Max Wagner debuted with Aberdeen, and Bowie brought the power. Triple-A: Norfolk Tides 1, Memphis Redbirds (Cardinals) 0 - Game 1 - F/8\nIt was an impressive showing for a trio of pitchers that have bounced between the big leagues and the minors this season. Rico Garcia got the start and tossed three shutout innings while striking out four. Louis Head followed with two strikeouts over his two scoreless innings. And finally it was Logan Gillaspie with three more zeros. Across all eight innings the Norfolk pitchers allowed just three hits and one walk in total.\nThere wasn’t much offense to discuss. The Tides offense only had three hits themselves, and they were all rather spread out. Their lone run came in the eighth inning as a result of the Manfred runner starting the inning at second base. Ramon Rodriguez drove them in on a single. The only other noteworthy occurrence was Jordan Westburg’s 18th double of the season.\nTriple-A: Memphis Redbirds 0, Norfolk Tides 0 - Game 2/Suspended in first inning\nAn active shooter situation in Memphis caused this game to be suspended after the top of the first inning. It is scheduled to be made up on Thursday.\n\n\nWith the active shooter situation in #Memphis right now, I'm told the Norfolk Tides and Memphis Redbirds players were pulled off the field and are currently sheltering in place at the stadium until Memphis police says it's safe. @WAVY_News— Craig Loper II (@CraigLoperWAVY) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\nDouble-A: Richmond Flying Squirrels (Giants) 8, Bowie Baysox 6\nBowie certainly brought the power to this game. They hit four home runs—one each from Andrew Daschbach, Coby Mayo, Zach Watson, and Andres Angulo—but each of them was of the solo variety. Angulo added a pair of doubles as well. Connor Norby also doubled.\n\n\n419 foot nuke from Coby Mayo. pic.twitter.com/BiIrqZxMEb— The Verge- An Orioles MiLB Podcast (@BSLOnTheVerge) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nStarter Justin Armbruester was able to be effective despite issuing four walks and striking out just three. Over five innings he allowed only one run on one hit, a solo home run. Conner Loeprich followed with two innings of relief, allowing one run on three hits and two strikeouts. It was a tougher game for Nolan Hoffman, who was saddled with the loss after allowing six runs (four earned) in his inning on the mound. A Coby Mayo error in the ninth inning made things tough for the pitcher, but then Hoffman compounded it by serving up several hard hit balls thereafter. Griffin McLarty came on and did a nice job to get out of the inning without further damage. \nHigh-A: Jersey Shore BlueClaws (Phillies) 4, Aberdeen IronBirds 0 - Game 1 - F/7\nThe Aberdeen lineup was no match for BlueClaws pitcher Victor Vargas, who tossed an abbreviated two-hit complete game. The only IronBirds to earn their way on base were Connor Pavolony and Luis Valdez, who each singled. Valdez was then thrown out trying to steal.\nJean Pinto had an effectively wild type of outing. The starter allowed just one run over four innings, but he also walked five. Alex Pham and Nick Roth combined to allow three runs on five hits and five strikeouts over two innings of relief.\nHigh-A: Aberdeen IronBirds 3, Jersey Shore BlueClaws (Phillies) 1 - Game 2 - F/8\nThe IronBirds hitters rebounded a bit in game two, recording nine hits in total. But only one of the hits went for extra bases, a double from Frederick Bencosme. Max Wagner, Dylan Beavers, and Bencosme had two hits each. Wagner added a stolen base, a solid showing for Wagner on his first day as a High-A player.\nIt was a terrific effort from the Aberdeen pitchers. Antonio Velez  struck out five over four innings, and the only run he allowed was unearned due to a throwing error from Billy Cook. Rickey Ramirez and Xavier Moore finished things up with a combined four innings, striking out six in the process.\nLow-A: Down East Wood Ducks (Rangers) 4, Delmarva Shorebirds 2 - F/11\nJackson Holliday is getting his footing under him at Delmarva. The number one overall pick went 3-for-4 with a pair of doubles, a walk, and an RBI. Isaac Bellony added two hits. But in general the Shorebirds lineup struggled, going just 2-for-10 with runners in scoring position.\nIn general, it was a good day for the Delmarva pitchers. Deivy Cruz allowed just one run over four innings of work as the starter. The first three relievers were also effective as Hayden Nierman, Ryan Long, and Cooper Chandler combined to throw five shutout innings. Edgar Portes tossed a scoreless 10th inning, but then had trouble in the 11th, allowing three runs (two earned).\nBox scores for Wednesday’s games can be found here.\nThursday’s Scheduled Games\n\nTriple-A Norfolk: at Memphis, 5:05.

        "description": "Photo by Rob Tringali/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n    \n\n  An ancillary loose end stemming from Freddie Freeman’s exit from the Braves and his subsequent return to Atlanta, has been closed.\nFreeman’s former agent, Casey Close of Excel Sports, filed suit in July against Fox Sports radio host Doug Gottlieb, who tweeted on June 29, “Casey Close never told Freddie Freeman about the Braves final offer, that is why Freeman fired him.”\nGottlieb on Wednesday took his hand out of the cookie jar long enough to write a statement saying that he’s apologized to Close. \n“While I always strive to report accurate information, I prematurely reported on these events and I simply got it wrong,” Gottlieb said in his statement. “Upon further vetting of my sources, a review of the lawsuit filed against me in this matter, and a direct conversation with Casey himself, I have learned the conduct I alleged did not occur and that there is no credible basis for stating that it did.”\nThe retraction from Gottlieb, in addition to deleting his original tweet, seems to have ended the legal proceedings in this affair, with Close and Excel Sports releasing a statement shortly after Gottlieb.\n“From the onset, we were clear that Mr. Gottlieb’s tweet was wholly inaccurate and that we would seek legal remedies to set the record straight,” said Excel Sports’ statement. “He has retracted his statement in its entirety and acknowledged that he got the story wrong. We consider this matter closed.”\nLinks\n\nJosh Byrnes, the Dodgers senior vice president of baseball operations who has been in the Los Angeles front office since 2015, is listed among the candidates for the Tigers’ vacant general manager position, per Lynn Henning of the Detroit News, Jon Heyman of the New York Post, and Jon Morosi of MLB Network. Tigers manager A.J. Hinch’s first managerial job came in Arizona under Byrnes in 2009-10.\nMarc Normandin at Baseball Prospectus wrote about why having minor league players as a separate bargaining unit than major league players won’t fracture the MLBPA.\nThe MLBPA on Wednesday joined the AFL-CIO, a group that represents over 12 million union members. “The MLBPA has a proud, 56-year history of success rooted in unity and a highly engaged membership,” executive director Tony Clark said in a statement. “We look forward to bringing that history and experience to bear as a more formal part of the movement.”\nMichael Baumann in his debut at FanGraphs notes why anyone using “analytics” as catch-all term is missing the point. “You have to know everything. Quantitative and qualitative data, stats and scouting, current events and history,” he wrote. “And because baseball reflects and interfaces with society, you have to know economics, politics, and philosophy as well. It’s all part of the big picture.”",

        "title": "Six Introductions That Will Change How You Read These Classics",
        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/09/introduction-classic-books/671365/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "In his excellent introduction to Edith Wharton’s The Writing of Fiction, the author and critic Brandon Taylor offers an observation that bears repeating: Literature from the past may contain dated worlds and ideas, but we can and should engage with it. Wharton’s works, for example, still present “some startling revelation about the way we live and write today,” he explains. Older writing can also give us “something to argue against.” Classic texts might remain static, but they are revolutionized over time by readers’ changing experiences and offer us the unique chance to be in “capacious communion” with them. Fresh introductions can help us achieve that intimacy.Literary superstars such as Taylor have been eager to take on the role of both guide and medium, providing front matter that links the past with the present by placing classic texts in a contemporary context. Recently, readers have been treated to Merve Emre musing on Virginia Woolf in The Annotated Mrs. Dalloway, Esmé Weijun Wang expounding on Joanne Greenberg’s I Never Promised You a Rose Garden, and Margo Jefferson schooling us on Gwendolyn Brooks’s Maud Martha. Toni Morrison, Rachel Cusk, Rachel Kushner, Jennifer Egan, and Hilary Mantel have all written introductions.The authors of the six forewords below ask us to reconsider our relationship with stories from the past. Through their interaction with the books they write about, they offer us new ways to read older works—and elevate this literary art form to new heights. Here, before we have made up our minds about a story, we can ask: What lasts? What should? \r\nPenguin Classics\r\nKarl Ove Knausgaard on James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (introduction translated by Martin Aitken)In Joyce’s 1916 debut novel, the author’s now-infamous alter ego, Stephen Dedalus (seen later in Ulysses), makes his fiery debut. Young Dedalus rejects the religion he has grown up with, eschews the Irish traditions he has known, leaves home, and ultimately commits to becoming an artist by not serving that which does not serve him. In his foreword to the Penguin centennial edition of the book, the Norwegian sensation Knausgaard calls Portrait a “Bildungsroman, a coming-of-age story, perhaps the prime example of that genre in English literature.” Knausgaard predictably muses on identity, but he doesn’t dwell unnecessarily on it. Instead, his winding observations and philosophical musings steal the show. Detailed observations about Joyce’s seminal work—that it “swells” with “mood,” that it is really a book about the soul—allow a bigger picture to emerge. “Literature is never the preserve of others, and it knows no center, which is to say that its center is any place where literature exists,” he writes. “Only by refusing to serve, as Stephen does, may the artist do just that: serve.”[Read: The book that never stops changing]\r\nNew York Review Books\r\nLauren Groff on Yūko Tsushima’s Woman Running in the Mountains, translated by Geraldine Harcourt Set in 1970s Japan, Tsushima’s novel—published in 1980 and reissued in 2022—follows the plight of Takiko Odaka, a young, single woman on the verge of having a child in a society that condemns unwed mothers. Tsushima captures the wild range of feelings and experiences that pregnancy and early motherhood inspire: beauty, suffering, boredom, banal domestic struggle, dogged determination to seek out happiness no matter what. The Matrix author Groff’s introduction does what few forewords do: It lets the author speak for herself. Groff quotes Tsushima, one of Japan’s most influential and prolific writers, extensively, intervening only to assist readers in sorting out the relationship between Tsushima’s life and work. As a result, instead of getting the rigid feeling of an expert dissecting their subject, one senses that Groff and Tsushima are kindred spirits: both are writers and mothers; both are interested in the complexity—and mundanity—of violence and ecstasy, joy and pain; both ask What is a heroine? What is heroic? (albeit from different places and times). They are letting us in on the secret that, perhaps, the answers are not what we have been led to believe.\r\nA Public Space\r\nYiyun Li on Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace in Tolstoy Together: 85 Days of War and Peace With Yiyun LiTo understand and appreciate the genius of Tolstoy Together—which celebrates the experience of reading the novelist’s masterwork about the Napoleonic invasion of Russia in 1812 and its impact on several aristocratic families—try to imagine an introduction as a set of nested Matryoshka dolls. Tolstoy Together is like this. First is Li introducing War and Peace; then comes Brigid Hughes, the founding editor of the nonprofit publisher A Public Space, introducing Tolstoy Together; then the book returns to War and Peace, as other well-known writers and readers from around the world share their insights about the classic—and their personal and communal experiences reading it. Li’s introduction encompasses and unites all these parts; she writes that readers “want writers to articulate that for which we haven’t yet found our own words, we want our senses to be made uncommon.” She compares War and Peace to an old tree whose majesty needs no defending, ending with the unexpected but welcome admission that “fallibility is in everything I do.” Perhaps her ability to acknowledge her own imperfection emboldens her to break all of the rules? Here, a book becomes the preface to another book, and the introduction doesn’t belong to just one writer. With Tolstoy Together, Li gives readers the exact language she knows they are seeking.[Read: The exquisite pain of reading in quarantine]\r\nDaunt Books\r\nSally Rooney on Natalia Ginzburg’s All Our Yesterdays, translated by Angus DavidsonIn her introduction to Daunt Books’s handsome reissue of the late Italian author Ginzburg’s third novel about life before and during war, Rooney gushes about her “transformative” encounter with Ginzburg’s “perfect” 1952 novel, then bursts into a recap of the main events of the book and the author’s life. Ginzburg grew up in a family of antifascists and married a Jewish organizer who was later tortured and murdered by the Nazi regime he opposed. Her protagonist, Anna, also belongs to a family with dissidents doing their best to survive the Second World War. As a young wife and mother, she gives fugitives refuge in the cellar of her home. Rooney raves about plot elements and the “depth and truth” of the full cast of characters, exulting in Ginzburg’s—and Anna’s—recognition of the “supreme moral urgency” of the moment. It is our time, not just the 1940s setting, that Rooney tells us she is thinking of when she writes, “In times of crisis … there can be no ethics without politics.” Like Ippolito, Emanuele, and Danilo—Ginzburg’s young men who meet in secret to share books considered, by some, too powerful—Rooney says, as if to a friend, Here, you really must read this.\r\nKnopf\r\nZadie Smith on Toni Morrison’s RecitatifMorrison, the Nobel Laureate and queen of American letters, wrote 11 novels—and only one stand-alone short story. Originally published in 1983 in an anthology edited by Amiri and Amina Baraka, Recitatif follows two characters—Twyla and Roberta—who have known each other since childhood. Readers are made to understand that one is Black and one is white, but not which is which. All racial identifiers have quite deliberately been omitted. One of the first things that readers may notice about Smith’s introduction is its size: It is as long as the story it introduces. Smith knows that Morrison has presented her readers with a puzzle and is eager to play along. She performs a close (very close) reading of the text that spans almost 40 pages, dissecting speech patterns, points of plot and character, and even the story’s title. But rather than attempting to solve the mystery (although, she confesses, she wishes she could), she unravels why the mystery matters and praises Morrison’s “poetic form and scientific method.” Morrison, Smith tells us, believed that a story could be an experiment. Smith seems to be asking why an introduction shouldn’t be one, too.[Read: Why Walt Whitman called America the “greatest poem”]\r\nUniversity of Chicago Press\r\nColm Tóibín on Henry James’s The Art of the Novel: Critical PrefacesWhen it comes to the prodigious and lasting work of the American-born novelist and critic James, one would be hard pressed to find a more apt or interesting guide than the Irish writer Tóibín. Tóibín wrote a novel, The Master, with James as its main character; he is also the author of All a Novelist Needs, critical essays on James and his works. In the 2011 University of Chicago Press reprint of The Art of the Novel—a curated selection of the prefaces James wrote for many of his own works—Tóibín leaves no stone unturned. Alongside the original 1934 introduction from the poet and critic R. P. Blackmur, he shares his own stunning reflections on James’s collection. James’s proclivity for dining out in 1877 London increased his interactions with “the most important figures of the day”; Tóibín’s delicious intro offers readers dramatic insights into the gossip (Robert Browning’s “talk doesn’t strike me as very good”) and real-life incidents (The Turn of the Screw was first told to James by the Archbishop of Canterbury!) that inspired his most popular works. If you are as good as James and Tóibín, even a foreword can be a masterpiece.​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission. Thank you for supporting The Atlantic.",

        "description": "The high-profile seditious conspiracy trial for the leader of the far-right Oath Keepers extremist group will begin this month after a judge on Wednesday rejected a last-minute bid by Stewart Rhodes to replace his lawyers and delay his Capitol riot case.Rhodes said in court papers this week there had been a “breakdown” in communication between him and his two lawyers, who he claimed weren&#x27;t defending him forcefully enough. Rhodes&#x27; new lawyer argued that the Oath Keepers founder has not been given enough time to adequately prepare for trial and urged the judge to delay his trial at least 90 days.But the obviously irritated judge called the claim that Rhodes is being denied a fair trial “simply false.”U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said Rhodes&#x27; suggestion that his lawyers are not providing effective counsel appeared to be “complete and utter nonsense” and questioned why concerns about his lawyers were surfacing for the first time just weeks before trial.“The notion that you are going to create the kind of havoc that you will — and havoc is the only appropriate word I can think of — by moving Mr. Rhodes&#x27; trial, not going to happen,” Mehta told Edward Tarpley, whom Rhodes wanted as his new lawyer.Mehta said Tarpley is free to join Rhodes&#x27; two other lawyers — James Lee Bright and Phillip Linder — but Mehta was not going to remove them from the case.Tarpley told The Associated Press after the hearing that he&#x27;s disappointed but respects the court&#x27;s decision and remains willing to help Rhodes&#x27; defense team at trial.“He never went into the Capitol ... he never told anybody to go into the Capitol,” Tarpley said. There’s a lot of things in his favor. And, you know, I just think that he’s been unfairly accused and wrongly prosecuted in this case.&quot;The case against Rhodes and four co-defendants starting Sept. 27 in federal court will be the most serious case to go to trial so far in the riot of Jan. 6, 2021, that delayed the certification of Joe Biden&#x27;s 2020 president victory over Donald Trump.It will also be a major test for the Department of Justice, which has brought rarely used and difficult-to-prove charges of seditious conspiracy against Oath Keepers members and those of another far-right extremist group, the Proud Boys.Authorities say Rhodes was the ringleader of the Oath Keepers&#x27; plot to violently stop the transfer of power. In the run-up to Jan. 6, authorities say the Oath Keepers recruited members, purchased weapons and set up a “quick reaction force” with guns on standby outside the capital with the goal of keeping President Donald Trump in office.On Jan. 6, prosecutors say the Oath Keepers formed two teams, or “stacks,” that entered the Capitol. Rhodes is not accused of going inside the building, but was seen gathered outside the Capitol with several members after they did, authorities say.Rhodes has said there was no plan to storm the Capitol and that the members who went inside the building went rogue. His lawyers have argued he believed Trump would invoke the Insurrection Act and call upon the Oath Keepers to support his bid to stay in power. When Trump did not do that, Rhodes took no action, his lawyers have said.Three members of the Oath Keepers have already pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy, are cooperating with investigators and could testify against Rhodes at trial.Rhodes claimed that his lawyers, Bright and Linder, were not answering his calls or visiting him enough and failed to file legal papers they promised to. The defense also argued its case would be hurt by the arrest this month of the Oath Keepers&#x27; general counsel — Kellye SoRelle — whom the defense was expecting to call to the stand.Bright denied not answering calls from Rhodes or failing to discuss the defense strategy with him. He called some of the new legal papers Rhodes wants to file “frivolous.”",

        "description": "Photo by Ed Zurga/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Happy Macedonian Independence Day! Anne Rogers details some adjustments Kris Bubic has made throughout the season:\n\nStill, Bubic was pleased with his second consecutive quality start, despite both of them turning into losses for the 25-year-old. The small sample size of success has been a result of better command, and there’s been at least one reason for that.\nAfter Bubic’s start at Tampa Bay, when he allowed four runs in 3 2/3 innings, he was throwing his bullpen session in-between starts when pitching coach Cal Eldred brought up the idea of pitching exclusively out of the stretch in order to minimize movement in Bubic’s delivery. Bubic had been thinking about doing it as well, so he made the adjustment and liked the results.\nHe initiated the new approach against the Padres, and the results weren’t good, with six runs in four innings. But Bubic saw better success against the White Sox last week and Guardians on Tuesday.\n\nRustin Dodd, who evidently is taking over for Alec Lewis at The Athletic, answers some questions about the Royals in an AL Central Roundtable ($):\n\nWhat key questions does your team need to address in the short, medium and long term?\nDodd: 1. The Royals have to figure out their pitching development infrastructure — at all levels of the organization. 2. They have to sort out some roster question marks. For instance, young catcher MJ Melendez has shown big pop and plenty of promise with his bat, but where does he fit in with Salvador Perez? Another one: Can Nick Pratto make enough contact to be a regular at first, and if so, how does he co-exist with Vinnie Pasquantino? And where exactly should Bobby Witt Jr. play on defense? 3. The last time there was this much pessimism from fans around the front office of Dayton Moore, the Royals were two years away from making the World Series in 2014 and three years away from winning the World Series. In other words, things can shift quickly. But as owner John Sherman eyes building a downtown ballpark in Kansas City, the team needs to offer some evidence — this offseason and in 2023 — that the plan is still moving in the right direction.\n\nAlso at The Athletic, Jim Bowden flies in the face of statistics and ranks Bobby Witt Jr. ahead of Adley Rutschman among AL rookies ($):\n\n2. Bobby Witt Jr., SS/3B, Royals\nAge: 22\nWAR: 0.7 OPS+: 105\nWitt became the fifth rookie in MLB history to hit 20 home runs and steal 20 bases in his first season. He follows in the footsteps of the late Mitchell Page, who did it in 1977, Ellis Burks (1987), Marty Cordova (1995) and Rodríguez, who hit the 20/20 milestone a couple of weeks before Witt. Like Rodríguez, Witt has the potential to join not only the 30/30 club in future seasons, but also the 40/40 club if he reaches his ceiling. He has slashed .246/.288/.439 with 23 doubles, six triples, 20 homers, 70 RBIs and 26 steals. Witt is the fastest player in the AL, according to Statcast, and he’s made significant defensive improvements at third base. I still think his best position is shortstop; regardless, he’s willing to play all over the diamond and profiles as an above-average defender wherever he plays.\n\nOver at Inside the Crown, David Lesky breaks down Tuesday’s loss, noting how the Royals have struggled pitching to the bottom third of opponent’s lineups:\n\nI honestly don’t know what to make of this. It’s easy to assume this is just because Royals pitchers aren’t very good and are going to be below average against everyone. And they sort of are, but they have allowed a lower OPS to fifth and sixth hitters than to nine hitters. Which is just crazy. In these situations, sometimes you ascribe a theory to match your preconceived notions, and that’s exactly what I’m doing here. I simply don’t feel like Royals pitching is prepared for an entire lineup. They let down when facing hitters they “should” get out and they end up getting hurt.\nTheir numbers against the top two (.266/.356/.419) are worse than league average (.254/.325/.411) but not as drastically as that bottom third difference. And their numbers against three through six (.277/.346/.444) are worse than league average (.246/.317/.410) but not as drastically as that bottom third difference. No, this is a bad pitching staff, but there’s something about the bottom of the order that shouldn’t be as big of an issue as it is and fixing that would go a long way toward inching back to respectability as a staff.\n\nHere’s an article written by somebody that perhaps doesn’t watch a lot of baseball, entitled “One player on every MLB team who deserves more love.” There’s a lot of false information in this article, but the entry for the Royals is particularly comical.\nChristian Yelich hit an absolute nuke on Tuesday:\n\n\nThe longest homer of 2022 belongs to @ChristianYelich.  (MLB x @GoogleCloud) pic.twitter.com/wAut5rA5tc— MLB (@MLB) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nShohei Ohtani has a case for both Cy Young and MVP honors this season.\nJeff Passan and David Schoenfield present this season’s breakout stars. ($)\nThe NFL season officially kicks off tonight in Inglewood. If you plan on tuning in, here are four things to watch for in the game.\nWith the College Football Playoff set to expand, here are some ideas to make it a truly great event.\nThe U.S. and International teams are set for this year’s Presidents Cup. Compared to the Ryder Cup, the Americans have dominated this event for the better part of two decades and are heavy favorites to win again this year at Quail Hollow.\nIn this week’s (awful) rental opportunity, we have what appears to be a stairwell that was converted into an apartment.\nDon’t like talking to people at drive-thrus? Well good news, Panera is testing out an AI ordering system.\nArchaeologists in Borneo uncovered evidence that the first human limb amputation was performed over 30000 years ago.\nYour song of the day is Alibi - Far Out Remix by Krewella",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore educators than parents report being approached by young adults with mental health concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings of the new survey underscore the important role teachers and educators can play in promoting youth mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an effort to improve access to care, the Biden Administration has allotted nearly $300 million to bolster mental health resources in schools.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew data suggests teens reach out to educators more than their parents about mental health concerns, while experts stress both adults can play complementary roles in supporting young people’s mental health.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMost educators, 78 percent, have been approached by a child about a mental or emotional concern, according to a CVS Health/Morning Consult survey published Thursday. That’s compared to 58 percent of parents who report the same, underscoring how a network of adults can help young people navigate their mental health.\n\n\n\nMore than three-quarters of educators say they are concerned about adolescents’ mental health, compared to 43 percent of parents who say the same. Nearly half of parents surveyed say they had initiated a mental health conversation with their child, while 22 percent of educators report ever doing so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poll was conducted online in August 2022 among 500 parents and 340 educators of teens between the ages 13 and 17.\n\n\n\nThe results come as children and adolescents face increasing mental health concerns, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Around 1.5 million more kids experienced depression or anxiety in 2021, prompting U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy to issue an advisory in December.\n\n\n\n“Mental health challenges in children, adolescents, and young adults are real and widespread,” Murthy said, adding “the future wellbeing of our country depends on how we support and invest in the next generation.”\n\n\n\nWhen asked about top stressors teens face today, educators overwhelmingly cited family dynamics and relationships, self-esteem, bullying and social dynamics, along with social media usage. In comparison, parents were more likely to cite academic pressure, self-esteem, and pandemic-related stress as top negative mental health influences.\n\n\n\nOver 70 percent of educators also say issues relating to gender, race, and sexuality were factors relating to teens’ negative mental health compared with just one quarter of parents. Both cohorts agreed the most beneficial resource to bolster teen mental health is more affordable mental health care.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is a priority for President Biden who in July announced a nearly $300 million allotment to expand access to mental health care in schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDespite increasing popularity for mental health days, where children do not attend school to focus on their well-being, only 12 states allow the practice. At the same time, barriers like social stigma and economic challenges may prevent more schools from taking up the practice.\n\n\n\nAs children turn to adults in many aspects of their lives for mental health support, both parents and educators say they feel equipped to help. An equal percentage of parents and educators report they would know where to find support for a young person, according to the survey. Both also say they would speak directly to the child, to one another, or seek help from a professional.\n\n\n\n“Young people continue to face a mental health crisis, but they are not facing it alone,” said CVS Health President and Chief Executive Officer Karen S. Lynch in a press release. “Mental health can, and should, become a part of everyday conversation in the classroom, during lunch hour and at the dinner table.”&nbsp;",

        "description": "In 1993, the Buffalo Bills were down 32 points to the Houston Oilers in the third quarter of an NFL playoff game. In one of the most astounding comebacks in sports history, the Bills ended up defeating the Oilers by a score of 41-38. \n\n\n\nWelcome, political fans,&nbsp;to the&nbsp;final quarter of the 2022 midterm House elections. Over the past several weeks, the punditry has morphed from digging the Democrats’ graves&nbsp;to hyping expectations of their over-performing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGoing into the summer, some forecasts had Democrats losing as many three-dozen seats.&nbsp;Coming out of summer, David Wasserman, the unusually prescient analyst from the Cook Political Report,&nbsp;wrote (correctly, in my view): “GOP Control No Longer a Foregone Conclusion.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExcept.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s still too early to tell. We are in a world of contradictions.&nbsp;Predictable and volatile at the same time. Settled one day, unsettled the next.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMost&nbsp;midterm cycles are easily defined by the political winds.&nbsp;This one is all about wind shears.&nbsp;As Wasserman&nbsp;notes,&nbsp;the climate has been changed by a variety of influences: the Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling undermining Roe v. Wade, falling gas prices, GOP primaries&nbsp;that produced&nbsp;Trumpian candidates in moderate electorates, legislative victories like the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS bill.\n\n\n\nAt the center of this particular playoff are two quarterbacks, the chairmen of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs one who held the DCCC chair from 2011 to 2016, I’ve watched both manage the environment with fascination.&nbsp;I can tell you that the job places you in a schizophrenic world. You’re simultaneously praised and pilloried; your reputation is celebrated and cremated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut this cycle is particularly difficult to manage.&nbsp;Here’s why.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFirst, both campaign committees&nbsp;basically plan as political meteorologists, making decisions by those prevailing winds. I&nbsp;used to call it a “flip-flop” scenario.&nbsp;A favorable wind at your back dictates a&nbsp;strategy of offense,&nbsp;and the battlefield is expanded to flip more seats.&nbsp;In a “flop” environment, with strong headwinds, you hunker down to save as many incumbents as you can.&nbsp;The battlefield is consolidated, resources triaged to minimize losses.\n\n\n\nSecond, the winds can change. A candidate’s utterances can turn safe districts into more competitive ones.&nbsp;For example, I remember sitting with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) when he chaired the DCCC in the miserable 2010 cycle. He’d just learned that Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who represented a reliably blue district, had endorsed a boycott of his home state to protest a state law that harmed immigrants.&nbsp;Grijalva’s position was noble, courageous. But the electoral blowback at the time looked serious.&nbsp;I’ll always remember the incredulity in Van Hollen’s voice: “Now we have to defend Raul Grijalva’s district?”\n\n\n\nThird, there is the infatuation some have with the&nbsp;“congressional generic ballot,” which measures whether voters want Republicans or Democrats in Congress.&nbsp;Consider the fluctuation of that measure since the beginning of the year, according to&nbsp;Five Thirty Eight: On Jan. 1, Republicans were up by nearly a point; drifting into summer, in May, they expanded to 2.5 points; on Aug. 1,&nbsp;they were tied with Democrats; by mid-August, Democrats had taken the lead; and last Monday, Democrats were up by a point.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDon’t be misled. The&nbsp;generic ballot reflects vague preferences at a particular moment, not turn out at the polls.&nbsp;And a midterm election strongly rests on turnout.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI remember watching the congressional generic ballot in 2014, the midterm following President Obama’s reelection. In the first six months of the year, our&nbsp;lead in the generic was between two and seven points.&nbsp;It began to decline in summer.&nbsp;Between August and September, the Republicans surged ahead by as many as seven points.&nbsp;Then, in the&nbsp;closing weeks, we’d battled back to a one-point lead. We felt good. We knew we’d lose seats, but the generic suggested it wouldn’t be calamitous.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe day after the midterms, the actual vote reflected a 5.7-point advantage for Republicans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat was in a fairly routine environment, with easier to predict trends and wind directions and more reliable rules of engagement.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI revise my analogy&nbsp;to the Bills comeback triumph. Actually, this isn’t an NFL game. This is hockey. Offense and defense shifting constantly.&nbsp;Bursts of propulsion. Skirmishes and random eruptions. And the majority for both parties seem as thin as ice.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSteve Israel&nbsp;represented New York in the U.S. House of Representatives over eight terms and was chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee from 2011 to 2015. He is now director of the Cornell Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy Institute of Politics and Global Affairs.&nbsp;Follow him on Twitter&nbsp;@RepSteveIsrael.&nbsp;",

News personality Geraldo Rivera said in a new tweet that he’s not going to support former President Trump again. \n\n\n\nRivera on Wednesday stressed the former president’s \"shameful\" claims that the 2020 election was stolen. \n\n\n\n“Election Deniers depress me,” Rivera said. “I blame President Trump for his shameful campaign to slander and undermine American faith in our elections.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“For all his positive accomplishments, and there are many, I could never support him again,” Rivera added. “Without fealty to the Constitution, we’re 2d rate.”\n\n\n\nThe former syndicated talk show host has been a frequent critic of Trump in the past few years, previously saying that Trump hadn’t spoken to him after Rivera declared that the 2020 election result had been decided.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRivera, who in January, 2021 said that Trump should be impeached for his role in the rioting at the Capitol, said in August that the former president still rules the GOP, adding that he’s disappointed in many if not most Republicans for still believing Trump’s election claims. \n\n\n\nRivera last month tweeted a response to James Carville's interview with The Hill during which the Democratic strategist said that GOP voters are “stupid” for believing that Trump did not lose the 2020 election.\n\n\n\n“James Carville is wrong. Trump does rule the GOP. Many, if not most Republicans believe Trump was robbed in 2020. That doesn't make them ignorant or racist,” Rivera said at the time. “It makes them disappointing. They're drunk on Trump Koolaid, and either don't believe he lost, or worse, don't care.”",

        "description": "Playground theatre, LondonFeaturing Keith Allen as a scheming PR man, this heartfelt comedy drawn from songwriter Grant Black’s own experiences is often great funOpening with a song named Wanker, Rehab initially sounds like a musical setting out to shock, but it is actually written with a lot of heart. It draws on songwriter Grant Black’s own experience and is about a 90s singer, Kid Pop, who winds up in rehab after he’s papped snorting cocaine. Pop’s inevitable story of redemption feels contrived but the characters he meets, and the lively score that underpins their stories, are great fun, nuanced and full of compassion.Wearing a union jack T-shirt and streaky eyeliner, Jonny Labey’s Kid Pop looks like all the 90s pop stars rolled into one. Labey is charming and cocky, with just a hint of vulnerability peeking through. There’s a particularly clever song, Lucy, in which his sexual fantasies are repeatedly interrupted by the other characters’ far stranger and funnier addictions (one guy, obsessed with sunbathing, rubs lustily up against a UV light). In the world of rehab, Kid Pop is no longer star of the show. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Your Thursday morning dose of New York Mets and MLB news, notes, and links. Meet the Mets\n\nThe Mets needed a win in the worst way and they managed to get two as they swept the doubleheader against the Pirates. Both Chris Bassitt and Jacob deGrom were stellar on the mound as they gave up one run between them. The offense also finally woke up with Tyler Naquin leading the way in Game 1 and the entire lineup getting into the spirit in Game 2. Eduardo Escobar was the standout with a four-hit game. Overall it was a much-needed, feel good day at the ballpark as the Mets remain in first place for another day.\nChoose your recap Game 1: Amazin’ Avenue, MLB.com, Post\nGame 2: Amazin’ Avenue, Daily News, Newsday, Post\nBefore the games the Mets placed Max Scherzer on the injured list but the ace doesn’t envision it being a long term injury.\nIt was also revealed that Starling Marte was diagnosed with a non-displaced fracture on his finger but is considered day-to-day.\nTylor Megill pitched an inning for Triple-A Syracuse and retired all three batters he faced. As he inches closer to a return to the big league club he will most likely find himself in the bullpen.\nDespite winning three games after Timmy Trumpet made his appearance at Citi Field, Jerry Seinfeld blames him for the team’s recent skid.\nWith both the Mets and Yankees scuffling, a Subway Series in October looked like a possibility but unless they both find a way to right the ship it is less likely it happens. \nAround the National League East\nThe Braves won their seventh straight with a 7-3 victory over the Athletics. Huascar Ynoa underwent Tommy John surgery after spending most of the year in Triple-A.\nThe Marlins lost their ninth in a row after they fell to the Phillies by a score of 4-3.\nAfter defeating the Marlins, the Phillies will look for the sweep against Sandy Alcantara.\nThe Cardinals rallied late against the Nationals before walking it off in the ninth inning. Washington issued an apology to the young girls who had a ball caught in front of them from a grown man at a game.\nAround Major League Baseball\nJuan Soto exited the game early after he was hit on the shoulder with a pitch but the Padres believe he will be ok.\nRadio host Doug Gottlieb finally admitted that the allegations he made that agent Casey Close never gave Freddie Freeman the Braves’ final offer were indeed false.\nShohei Ohtani might not be the frontrunner for the MVP or the Cy Young awards but a case can be made that he deserves both.\nAaron Judge will join elite company if he makes it to 60 home runs this season, but his feat might be the most impressive.\nThe Major League Baseball Players Association joined AFL-CIO to help strengthen its labor movement.\nYesterday at Amazin’ Avenue\nOn Episode 140 of A Pod of Their Own the sad times of the New York Mets was discussed.\nThis Date in Mets History\nOn this date in 1969, the Mets clinched their first winning record in franchise history behind a strong effort by Tom Seaver.",

        "description": "Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images\n    \n\n  And the Cubs had lots and lots of baserunners... but almost no scoring. For five innings, this was a good, close, competitive game, even though the Cubs kept stranding baserunners.\nThen in the sixth, the bullpen (well, Erich Uelmen, specifically) completely fell apart, the Reds scored four runs, and from there they coasted to a 7-1 win over the Cubs.\nThe Cubs scored first, in the second inning. Nelson Velázquez and Yan Gomes led off with singles, and P.J. Higgins also singled for a 1-0 Cubs lead [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nI could stop now, because it’s all downhill from here. But you come here for game recaps, so I shall give you one.\nThe Reds tied the game in the third on a long home run by Aristides Aquino that wound up in the gangway between two buildings on Waveland.\nWho got the ball? Of course, it was Ballhawk Dave!\n\n\nReds Aristides Aquino with a 440ft bomb to Waveland Avenue. His 6th season and 37th career. One hop between rooftop buildings. Not to old to climb fences!!  ;) #cubs #reds #wrigley #cubswin #needkey pic.twitter.com/ws5fzbWY3m— BALLHAWK.NET (@Super_Dave) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\nI saw him after the game on my way to my car. He ripped his shorts going after that baseball.\nAnyway, back to baseball. Kyle Farmer also homered for Cincinnati in the fourth inning, giving the Reds a 2-1 lead.\nThe Cubs had no shortage of baserunners. After Higgins’ RBI hit in the second, putting runners on first and third with nobody out, Nick Madrigal hit into a double play. The Cubs also hit into a double play (Velázquez) in the fourth, and even after two more singles in that inning, couldn’t score again.\nIt all fell apart in the sixth. Javier Assad gave up two singles with one out and was removed. Assad didn’t pitch badly, but both those runners scored when Erich Uelmen had a disaster of an outing: Walk, single, single, then he too was removed. Michael Rucker relieved Uelmen and gave up an RBI single to complete the scoring for the Reds in that inning, but that gave them a 6-1 lead which was more than enough. They added another home run off Jeremiah Estrada in the ninth to complete their scoring.\nMeanwhile, the Cubs had three more singles in the sixth without scoring, because of yet another double play (Nico Hoerner hit into this one). In all, the Cubs put 12 hits on the board, all but one of them singles, and went 1-for-10 with RISP. That, and Uelmen’s rough outing, were the story of the game.\nAssad, I thought, threw very well. His line doesn’t reflect that, but again, two of the runs charged to him scored after he left the game. Assad first came to the major leagues because the Cubs needed an extra starter for last month’s doubleheader against the Cardinals, but has now thrown well enough to be put in the mix for next year’s rotation. He’s Rule 5 eligible this December, so he’ll have to be kept on the 40-man roster or the Cubs risk losing him. That’s all part of a number of difficult 40-man decisions the team has:\n\nJed Hoyer, the Cubs’ president of baseball operations, has called it one of those “good problems” that a team encounters. Chicago currently has a long list of players — including some high-profile prospects — who will need to be placed on the 40-man roster this winter for Rule 5 Draft protection.\n“We’re trying to figure out our roster, which is a bit more complicated than usual,” Hoyer said. “We have had a lot of discussions about the 40-man for the last few weeks, how we’re going to play it.”\n\nRepeat after me: As always, we await developments.\nThere are a couple of other things from this game worth noting.\nHere’s a nice defensive play by Assad that ended the fifth inning [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nYan Gomes wound up going 4-for-4, which was a career first:\n\n\nCubs catcher Yan Gomes is 4-for-4 tonight. It's the fourth time in his career he's had at least four hits, but the first game he did so while not also recording an out.— Jordan Bastian (@MLBastian) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\nSo that’s good, anyway. One final note: The last time before Wednesday that the Cubs had 12 hits but scored only once in a nine-inning game was June 16, 2003, a 5-1 loss to the Blue Jays at Toronto, and the last time they did that at Wrigley Field was April 19, 1964, an 8-1 loss to the Phillies.\nThat’s about all that’s worth talking about in this one, so let’s move on to the series finale, which will take place Thursday afternoon at 1:20 p.m. CT. Adrian Sampson will start for the Cubs and Luis Cessa will go for Cincinnati. TV coverage for this one is on YouTube. This BCB article from last May, when a Cubs/Pirates game was featured on YouTube, will tell you how to watch today’s game. (It’s free, no signup or account necessary.)",

        "description": "Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images\n    \n\n  White Sox out-mash Mariners; Rays shutout Red Sox; Blue Jays cruise past Orioles; Astros walk off Rangers in extras What a huge day for the Yankees! They swept the doubleheader against the Twins in dramatic fashion, first with a wild 5-4 extra-innings walk-off followed by a dominant 7-1 victory that featured 14 strikeouts from Gerrit Cole and Isiah Kiner-Falefa’s first career grand slam. The pair of victories couldn’t be better timed as many of their AL rivals also won, so let’s recap those games.\n\nChicago White Sox 9 (69-68) vs. Seattle Mariners 6 (77-60)\n\nWhat looked like a pitchers’ duel in the early frames transformed into a slugfest by the end. Luis Castillo struck out the first six batters faced while Michael Kopech matched him zero for zero in the first couple innings. It wouldn’t stay that way for long, with Seattle opening the scoring with a four-run third. Julio Rodríguez was the first to get on the board with an RBI double before coming in to score on a sac fly. Eugenio Suárez capped off the scoring in the frame with two-run bomb to give the Mariners a seemingly comfortable lead. \nThat lead quickly evaporated when the White Sox clawed back two runs in the fourth on an Eloy Jiménez home run. They’d grab the lead scoring four in an error-aided sixth. Jiménez went 3-for-4 with the home run and a double and three driven in while José Abreu and Gavin Sheets each contributed two batted in. On the other side, Suárez had two long balls in the game, the second a solo shot in the seventh to tie the game. However, Chicago managed to tack on three more in the final two frames to grab a 9-6 victory and tie with the Twins two games back of the division-leading Guardians.\n\n\nBoston Red Sox 0 (67-71) vs. Tampa Bay Rays 1 (77-58)\n\nIt’s hard to imagine a more miserable baseball game than a 1-0 loss at the Trop. Such was the fate that befell the Red Sox, as Jeffrey Springs and the obligatory procession of Rays relievers held them scoreless on six hits. The Rays hardly faired any better, as Nick Pivetta held them to one run on two hits in five innings after which the Boston bullpen backed their starter up with three scoreless frames. That lone run came in the fifth when Francisco Mejía led off with a double before being driven home on a Taylor Walls single. With the victory, the Rays maintain their lead over the Mariners for the first Wild Card spot.\n\n\nToronto Blue Jays 4 (76-60) vs. Baltimore Orioles 1 (72-65)\n\nAlek Manoah was back to his dominant self, going eight innings allowing a run on three hits against five strikeouts. Baltimore actually opened the scoring in the bottom of the first on a Ryan Mountcastle RBI double, but it would be all Blue Jays from that point forward.\nToronto tied it in the top half of the next frame before a three-run fifth well and truly tilted this game in their favor. Alejandro Kirk, Raimel Tapia, and Santiago Espinal all had multi-hit nights in the Blue Jays’ eventual 4-1 win. The victory capped off a critical 3-1 series win over the Orioles as the two teams battle it out for the final wild card spot. Toronto currently sits 4.5 games ahead of their avian foes for that last playoff berth.\n\n\nTexas Rangers 3 (59-77) vs. Houston Astros 4 (88-49)\n\nThe Rangers gave their Texas rivals a fair fight, but the Astros managed to eke out an extra-innings walk-off victory. Texas jumped out to an early 3-0 lead thanks to a first inning solo shot from Nathaniel Lowe and RBI from Marcus Semien and Kole Calhoun in the third. \nHouston responded in the fourth on a Yuli Gurriel RBI single before Kyle Tucker tied the game in the sixth with a two-run blast. The score would remain knotted at three apiece until the Astros walked it off in the tenth on a wild pitch by Jonathan Hernández. \n\nOther Contenders\nCleveland Guardians 1 (70-65) vs. Kansas City Royals 2 (56-82): Both teams pitched marvelously in this game, with Zack Greinke giving the Royals six innings on one-run ball while the Guardians shut out the Kansas City hitters for eight innings. The Guardians struck first in the fourth at which point you figured one of the best bullpens in baseball would hold down the lead. They managed to do so until the unlikeliest of culprits — closer Emmanuel Clase — blew the save thanks to a pair of leadoff walks, a single, and a Salvador Perez walk-off sac fly.

        "description": "Two role players the Orioles found for next to nothing.  | Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Whatever happens down the stretch, this team has extracted maximum productivity from its players and proven itself to be much more than the sum of its parts. As we head into the final stretch of the season, let’s crunch some numbers. Not W-L, OPS+, wRC+, or WAR. I mean moolah. Dollars and cents. Team payroll. \nYou probably know this if you’ve been anywhere near CamdenChat this season, but the 2022 Orioles, picked by everyone to finish last in the AL East, have grossly outperformed expectations. Pre-season, the only interesting question, FanGraphs offered, was whether they’d be “at least an interesting cellar dweller.” Right now, the Birds’ playoff chances are up in the air, but at 72-64, they’re outperforming the season predictions by about 20 wins, and have a better record than eighteen other clubs. \nBesides the gap between expectations and performance, what makes the Orioles’ performance impressive is that they are doing this with the lowest payroll in baseball.\nConsider the table below. There are lots of high-performing teams with big payrolls. There are bad teams with low payrolls. There aren’t many in between. \n\nThe mighty Dodgers have the highest payroll ($265.6 million) and the best record (94-42) in the majors. Per win, they’re paying a cool $2.82 million. The Mariners ($114.9 million, 77-60 record) are having a great year. Each Seattle win costs $1.49 million. The colossally disappointing Angels are top of the class in overpaying per win, at about $3 million each. \nConsider those numbers, and then consider the Orioles. With a $43.8 million payroll and 72 wins, the Orioles are paying $608,833 per win, which is the lowest figure in the Majors. \nWe can put that in perspective by comparing the Orioles to their AL East competition. As good as the AL East has been, some big spenders aren’t getting much bang for their buck. The underperforming Red Sox, with a $207 million payroll and just 67 wins, are spending $3.1 million per win. The Blue Jays, $2.2 million. The Yankees, $3.1 million (note, in light of Boston, just how comparatively inflated that makes the Yankee payroll). The Rays—the gold standard in stretching dollars—$1.18 million. \nAll of this makes the Orioles look pretty clever, and the achievements of their personnel particularly impressive how much better paid their counterparts are. Compare the Orioles and the Blue Jays rotations. Orioles starters make a combined $8.6 million, and Jordan Lyles is taking home $6 million of that. Toronto, meanwhile, spent $73 million on their rotation, includiung the injured Hyun-Jin Ryu (and $52 million if you don’t). Toronto starters’ ERA: 4.06. Orioles starters: 4.33. Not a massive difference.\nAll year, Baltimore has gotten contributions from unlikely sources. Out of their Top 5 players in WAR, there’s not a millionaire among them (unless you count Adley Rutschman’s $8.1 million signing bonus, which you totally can). Rutschman (4.6 WAR) is making $526,902 in his pre-arbitration salary. Cedric Mullins (3.5 WAR), Ramón Urías (3.3 WAR), Félix Bautista, and Jorge Mateo (2.8 WAR) all make around the league minimum of $700,000.\nOf course, bargain-hunting can go too far. People aren’t clothing, or dishwashers, or cars. The Orioles front office might be high fiving each other for their thrifty, overperforming ways, and they deserve the kudos. But at some point, the team will need to start paying its players. The Orioles don’t want to be known as the best darn cheapskates in the Major Leagues. And they will need to pony up for pitching and key free agents. At the risk of pouring salt on the wound, this was probably the lesson of the Toronto series. \nBut back to the glass half-full perspective. MLB recently ran a piece under the headline, “One thing we got wrong for each team in 2022.” Their Orioles-related answer was: “Everything.” The Orioles are the most surprising team in baseball right now, both because their turnaround since 2021 is historic, and because they’re drastically outperforming the limits of their own payroll. The Orioles team reboot depends on trying to beat the Tampa Bay Rays at their own game. For now, signs are good that they’re learning the important lessons.",

Looking at the two cameras side-by-side, the X3’s biggest upgrade is obvious — the company dropped the mildly confusing “One” from the camera’s name. Oh, and instead of a small, circular touchscreen, the X3 now sports a 2.29-inch rectangular display, which you can use to preview and review footage and control the device. (Ironically, the X2’s biggest upgrade was also in the display department.)\nAt $449.99, the X3 is slightly more expensive than its predecessor and still has the same 5.7K max resolution as the X2 did. However, the company says the camera’s 1/2-inch sensors have gotten an upgrade for “big resolution and image...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday shared what he called “good news” about his country’s armed forces recapturing settlements from Russia as the months-long conflict with Moscow continues.\n\n\n\n“This week we have good news from the Kharkiv region. Probably, you all have already seen reports about the activity of Ukrainian defenders. And I think every citizen feels proud of our warriors,” Zelensky said in his presidential address on Wednesday. “It is a well-deserved pride, a right feeling.”\n\n\n\nZelensky noted the successful victories Ukraine’s brigade units had in the unnamed settlements, thanking them for the “bravery and heroism” they showed during the combat missions. \n\n\n\nThe leader also congratulated the country’s 406th Separate Artillery Brigade and the 60th Separate Infantry Brigade for their victories on the battlefield. \n\n\n\n“Each success of our military in one direction or another changes the general situation along the entire front line in favor of Ukraine,” Zelensky said in his address, noting that the new victories will help benefit fighters in regions such as Zaporizhzhia, where a nuclear plant has been the target of heavy shelling attacks during the conflict as many share concerns about a potential nuclear disaster across the European continent. \n\n\n\n“The more difficult it is for the occupiers, the more losses they have, the better the positions of our defenders in Donbas will be, the more reliable the defense of Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and the cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region will be, the faster we will be able to liberate the Azov region and the entire south.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZelensky’s remarks come as Secretary of State Antony Blinken made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv on Thursday, announcing that the U.S. will send more than $2 billion in military aid to Ukraine and other countries that have been threatened by Russia.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nU.S. officials also announced on Thursday that President Biden has approved additional military aid to Ukraine worth up to $675 million, which includes armored ambulances, anti-tank systems, artillery munitions and howitzers.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/3633774-dhs-unwinds-trump-era-public-charge-restrictions/",
        "description": "The Biden administration on Thursday finalized a rule to replace a Trump-era policy that sought to limit immigration of those it feared may rely on social services.\n\n\n\nThe new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy rolls back the Trump administration's so-called public charge rule, restricting immigration pathways for those seeking to become U.S. citizens only if they are “primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.”\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration stopped defending the Trump-era rule just months after taking office, but the new rule is a departure from a Trump-era policy requiring prospective new citizens to forecast whether they might at any time rely on government aid.\n\n\n\nIt barred those who received assistance from one program over the course of a year and roped in new programs that were previously excluded from consideration, including food stamps and medical assistance.\n\n\n\n“This action ensures fair and humane treatment of legal immigrants and their U.S. citizen family members,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a release. \n\n\n\n“Consistent with America’s bedrock values, we will not penalize individuals for choosing to access the health benefits and other supplemental government services available to them.”\n\n\n\nThe Hill&nbsp;first reported&nbsp;the rule was expected to be released Thursday.\n\n\n\nDHS described its new rule as restoring “the historical understanding of a ‘public charge’ that had been in place for decades, until the prior administration began to consider supplemental public health benefits such as Medicaid and nutritional assistance.”\n\n\n\nAn applicant's use of cash assistance programs will still be weighed as a factor in a green card application.\n\n\n\nThe Trump-era public charge rule was one of a number of restrictions the previous administration sought to put in place restricting pathways to citizenship for those already in the U.S. as well as for those overseas seeking immigration visas.\n\n\n\nBut the Biden administration said the policy had ramifications for U.S. citizens as well, particularly in households where parents hold different immigration statuses, noting a drop of enrollment in such programs for children from those families.",

if Judge Aileen Cannon is right? In terms of conducting a criminal investigation, what is the actual harm in appointing a special master in the Mar-a-Lago case?\n\n\n\nFor argument’s sake, let's take the point of view that appointing a special master is no big deal and will eventually work to the government's advantage.\n\n\n\nWhy would anyone do that?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBecause criminal investigations are complicated, and one must take the long view here. The Department of Justice (DOJ) needs to keep its powder dry for the time being. Resist any appeal, for now.\n\n\n\nThe mother of all legal battles will likely come after an indictment — if any — comes down. Should Donald Trump or any of his associates be charged, the legal defense team would almost certainly file a motion to suppress all evidence obtained by the government derived from the execution of the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\nThe court would then set a date for a suppression hearing, which would effectively be a mini-trial — because should the government prevail (and they should, given what is known about the case so far), it would be game - set - match: DOJ. Evidence from the search warrant would be admitted into court during the actual trial, and Trump has no viable defense, that I see.\n\n\n\nSo, the suppression hearing would be the big deal.\n\n\n\nThe government's hand would actually be reinforced during a suppression hearing by the appointment of a special master: DOJ could argue that not only did the FBI follow every DOJ protocol with regard to the search warrant but the evidence was also reviewed by a special master as requested by the Trump legal team.\n\n\n\nIt should not take more than a month or so for the special master to analyze the documents seized, so those arguing that the special master appointment is slowing things down with regard to the investigation really don't know what they’re talking about, because an appeal of the special master decision to the 11th Circuit — one of the most conservative in the land — would likely take months.\n\n\n\nSo, when Judge Cannon asked out loud to the government “What do you have to lose?” she was right: There is almost nothing to lose.\n\n\n\nShould the special master exclude a couple of miscellaneous documents, the DOJ would still have several hundred at its disposal to prosecute.\n\n\n\nIf the special master were to exclude all the documents seized, using an expansive interpretation of executive privilege, then the DOJ must fight that legal battle to the highest court.\n\n\n\nBut what are the odds of that happening?&nbsp;Almost none.\n\n\n\nThe documents seized belong to the government, not the ex-president. That is the whole point of the search warrant; in fact, that is the whole point of the entire investigation.\n\n\n\nDOJ needs to swallow hard and get on with its investigation — and, yes, that means dealing with a special master.\n\n\n\nThe big legal fight — if there is one — will be at the suppression hearing, and the fact the DOJ will have followed every protocol will be better served by abiding by Judge Cannon’s wishes and utilizing the special master.\n\n\n\nThe likelihood of a stronger government hand at a suppression hearing, should there be one, trumps the needless delay of wasting time now over premature legal bickering and appeals with regard to the special master.\n\n\n\nThe DOJ needs to recognize that fact and ride out the appointment of a special master, because it holds the winning hand — and it can demonstrate the absurdity of Judge Cannon’s legal reasoning later, if necessary. Appealing now would only move the game to Donald Trump’s home court: slow-walking the justice system, one of his specialties.\n\n\n\nJustice would best be served if DOJ did not to fall into that trap.\n\n\n\nI don’t see that Trump has any viable legal defense for his ill-considered actions with regard to mishandling government documents.&nbsp;It appears that Bill Barr, his former attorney general, agrees.\n\n\n\nDOJ should not help create a defense for him: It should finish the investigation, hand down an indictment and do so in short order — and, yes, that means dealing with a special master.\n\n\n\nMartin J.

You can’t do that against any team, even the Royals, and expect to win much. Luckily the Twins dropped both of their games against the Yankees, leaving them and the White Sox 2.0 games being Cleveland for the AL Central. \nCleveland Guardians news\nIconic Cleveland baseball drummer John Adams gives update | WKYCLegendary Cleveland fan and club Hall of Famer John Adams is determined to make it back to Progressive Field someday. He has not attended a game in person since 2019 while dealing with health issues. \nTerry Francona’s ‘gray cloud’ may have passed his jinx to a new generation | ClevelandIf you’re a member of the Kinneberg family you may want to bring a glove to future games that Terry Francona manages.

The attention in the bullpen has all been on James Karinchak and Emmanuel Clase, but Stephan, a former Rule 5 pick from the Yankees, quietly has a 2.53 ERA in 53.1 innings. \nAround the league\n\nThe Twins pitched to Aaron Judge. \nThe White Sox aren’t giving up yet. \nThe Pirates are making moves. \nHere’s a behind-the-back pass from Vlad Guerrero Jr. \nZac Gallen is really, really good. \nAnother Padre star is injured. \nMike Trout and Shohei Ohtani combine to go 3-9 with two home runs in Angels loss.",

        "description": "A 25-year-old Minneapolis man has been charged with converting multiple guns to fully automatic fire, violating federal bans on machine guns. The criminal complaint against Aaron Malik Cato, filed in U.S. District Court, says customs and border protection officials intercepted a suspicious package headed to Cato&#x27;s north Minneapolis home from Taiwan. An inspection found so-called auto sears, which can convert semi-automatic guns to continuous fire. An undercover agent delivered the package to Cato&#x27;s home, and agents raided the house minutes later. Investigators say they found enough parts in the package to convert 10 handguns to fully automatic fire. Minneapolis police have been sounding alarms about a sharp rise in fully automatic gunfire on the city’s streets, saying they have tracked thousands of rounds going off in the last two years. Police officials presented data on gun violence to the Minneapolis City Council last month. They said the city’s ShotSpotter system first noted automatic gunfire in August 2020, with 50 such activations in 2021, January through August. This year, the department said there were 183 such detections, involving nearly 2,000 rounds fired. The federal criminal complaint filed Sept. 1 said Cato admitted to importing the devices and said that he had been both importing so-called switches and using 3D printers to create more of them in his home. Police seized both handguns and AR-15-style long guns from his residence. Federal agents said Cato had ordered a previous shipment of switches from Russia in October. Cato was arraigned on Wednesday and ordered held pending further proceedings.  State patrol, Metro policeStep up efforts to reduce violent crime",

        "description": "The Woman Who Became a Company:\n\nSince corporations can claim trade secrets, [Jennifer Lyn] Morone decided to resist pervasive data capture by incorporating herself, so that the company, JLM Inc., contains the intellectual property and activities of the human Morone. If a corporation can be a person, perhaps a person could be a corporation and so protect their data! The articles of incorporation enable Morone’s data to qualify as intellectual property and thus purport to offer protections from the data marketplace. The human Morone’s privacy is possible because it is the product and trade secret of the company, JLM Inc., which is incorporated in the state of Delaware. With its own Court of Chancery that hears cases involving corporate law, Delaware’s legal structure is favorable to business. The state also does not collect corporate taxes from those that do business outside the state or tax “intangible assets” — like data. […] \nAs JLM Inc., Morone has an obligation to refuse the terms and agreements that permit apps and websites to share data with their parent tech companies, alongside third and fourth parties. She must protect the secret formula of who she is so that she can sell it, making it a challenge for her to participate in many of the interactive information streams common to the 21st century. She can’t use apps, websites with cookies, or most search engines. They track her and collect data about her. That data is the property of JLM Inc. and so she must not engage these services. The problem with maintaining the marketplace as the point of reference for data governance is how it reinforces exploitative practices that don’t have clear, long-term safeguards for participants. Morone’s experience shows that the corporation doesn’t provide a solution to the extractive practices of these apps, platforms, and sites for a human who wants to live, work, or socialize today. \n\nEverything about this story is deeply sad. ",

The Amylyx drug is not a cure for ALS, but has been shown in a clinical trial to slow the progression of the neurological disease.

        "description": "Eight House lawmakers arrived in Taiwan on Wednesday to discuss relations with the U.S.\n\n\n\nIt's just the latest visit by U.S. lawmakers to Taiwan since Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) made her own historic trip in August — despite reservations by the Biden administration. \n\n\n\nChina claims sovereignty over the self-governing island, and fears of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan have been on the rise, particularly since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \n\n\n\nThe delegation to Taiwan, which will be in the country until Friday, is led by Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.).\n\n\n\nMurphy is joined by Reps. Scott Franklin (R-Fla.), Kaiali’i Kahele (D-Hawaii), Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), Andy Barr (R-Ky.), Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) and Kat Cammack (R-Fla.).\n\n\n\n“The delegation will meet with senior Taiwan leaders to discuss U.S.-Taiwan relations, regional security, trade and investment, global supply chains, and other significant issues of mutual interest,” the American Institute in Taiwan, the U.S.'s de facto embassy on the island, said in a statement regarding the trip.\n\n\n\nThe Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned Pelosi's visit, saying that it “gravely undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.”\n\n\n\nChina began conducting military drills in the waters surrounding Taiwan shortly after Pelosi’s trip.",

        "description": "A new poll reveals that almost half of those surveyed — 47 percent — said former President Trump did something illegal or unethical in the wake of documents being seized from his home in Florida and should be charged with a crime.\n\n\n\nFourteen percent in the NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist survey said Trump acted illegally or unethically but should not face criminal charges.\n\n\n\nForty-four percent of respondents said after FBI agents seized boxes of government documents and materials at Mar-a-Lago that Trump did something illegal. Another 17 percent said Trump's actions were unethical but not illegal, and 29 percent said the former president did nothing wrong.\n\n\n\nTwenty percent of Republicans surveyed said that Trump did something unethical, while only 5 percent said the former president did something illegal. Most Republicans, 63 percent, said that he did nothing wrong, according to the poll.\n\n\n\nThe survey also reveals that most Americans, 61 percent, said they do not want Trump to run again for office in 2024. This includes 90 percent of Democrats, 26 percent of Republicans and 67 percent of independents. \n\n\n\nA slightly higher percentage of respondents — 65 percent — said Trump should not run for office again if he is convicted of a crime connected to the search of Mar-a-Lago. \n\n\n\nHowever, 27 percent of Americans — including 61 percent of Republicans — said they still would want Trump to run in 2024 if he was convicted of a crime.\n\n\n\nThe FBI entered Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago in August after securing a search warrant from a federal magistrate judge.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice said classified documents were seized and Trump may have violated the Presidential Records Act by keeping presidential records that former executives have always turned over to the National Archives. \n\n\n\nTrump has insisted he did nothing wrong in connection with the records. \n\n\n\nThe new poll of 1,236 adults, conducted from Aug. 29 to Sept. 1, has a margin of error of 4.1 percentage points.",

        "description": "MLB Pipeline | Twitter\n    \n\n  Rushing had a 1.356 OPS for Rancho A pair of Dodgers minor leaguers won player of the month awards after stellar performances in August. Catcher Dalton Rushing and pitcher Reinaldo De Paula were both selected for the California League player and pitcher of the month for Rancho Cucamonga, the Low-A affiliate of the Dodgers.\nRushing was selected by the Dodgers in the second round (40th overall) of the 2022 MLB Draft out of the University of Louisville. He immediately introduced himself with a solo home run in his first career at-bat with the Quakes upon his August 4 arrival and hit six homers for his opening month as a professional.\nThe 21-year-old led the league in average (.442), on-base percentage (.551), slugging percentage (.805) and OPS (1.356). He was second in doubles (10) and third in hits (34) and total bases (62), posting eight multi-hit games. MLB Pipeline already has Rushing as the No. 9 prospect in the organization.\nDe Paula went 2-0 with two saves and a hold while finishing seven games for the Quakes. He did not allow a run and allowed just four hits in his nine appearances while striking out 14 in as many innings. \nThe right-hander held opponents to a .089 batting average in August prior to his August 25 promotion to High-A Great Lakes. The Dodgers signed De Paula, 23, as an international free agent out of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, in May of 2017.\nNow onto the action for Wednesday, or lack-thereof, as the four teams combined for five runs and one win between them.\nTriple-A Oklahoma City\nOklahoma City allowed four runs in the third inning and had little response offensively, dropping a 6-1 game to Tacoma (Mariners).\nThe loss is the sixth in the seven games for OKC, leaving them clinging to a 1.0-game lead in the PCL East. Round Rock (Rangers) lost to stay the game behind and El Paso (Padres) won both ends of their doubleheader Wednesday to move into a tie with Round Rock for second place.\nGavin Stone made his third start for OKC and the first at home since his promotion in mid-August. The right-hander ran into some trouble in the third inning, allowing four runs (two earned) after his first two starts were scoreless.\nAfter back-to-back doubles started the inning to score the first run of the game, Stone allowed a run on a wild pitch and would later give up a two-run single after Edwin Ríos made an error with two outs to prolong the inning.\nJason Martin reached all four times with two walks to go with a single and a double. The single in the seventh inning led to the only run of the game for OKC when he stole second and came around on a Jacob Amaya double. The Dodgers had chances to score but ended the night 2-for-10 with runners in scoring position.\nA pair of relievers continued their rehab assignments Wednesday. Victor González pitched a scoreless fifth and Tommy Kahnle made a back-to-back appearance with two strikeouts in a scoreless sixth. The right-hander also pitched Tuesday but needed only six pitches to get three outs.\nDouble-A Tulsa\nThere isn’t much to say for Tulsa other than to say they were shutout 11-0 on the road by Frisco (Rangers) Wednesday. The team produced only three hits and a walk, with two of the hits coming from Buddy Reed.\nStarter Kyle Hurt was tagged with four runs in the first and would be lifted before getting out of the inning. John Rooney came on and gave up seven runs in the third, of which only two were earned after two errors in the inning for the (Drillers).\nHigh-A Great Lakes\nGreat Lakes returned the favor after losing 3-0 Tuesday, turning around and winning 3-0 over West Michigan (Tigers).\nEddys Leonard tripled in a run in both the third and the ninth, while Austin Gauthier walked with the bases loaded in the eighth. Damon Keith was 2-for-5 out of the leadoff spot and scored two of the three runs.\nFour pitchers combined for the shutout, including five scoreless from starter Adolfo Ramirez. The right-hander lowered his ERA to 1.46 as he allowed only two hits and a walk while striking out six.\nReliever Ben Harris closed it out for his fourth save, striking out all three batters he faced. The lefty stretched his scoreless streak to 22.0 innings over 17 games and is 3-0 with a 0.67 ERA since being promoted to the Loons in late June.\nLow-A Rancho Cucamonga\nRancho had more hits than Lake Elsinore (Padres) but could only push one run across all night in a 4-1 loss at home.\nJake Vogel and Alex Freeland were both 2-for-4 near the top of the lineup. The only run  came in the sixth inning on a Bubba Alleyne ground out to score Vogel.\nAll four runs allowed came by way of the home run ball, including a two-run shot in the seventh to put the game away. The Quakes threatened in the ninth with two singles to put runners on the corners but failed to score.\nRancho was 0-for-6 on the night with runners in scoring position.\nTransactions\nDouble-A: Tulsa Drillers placed catcher Carson Taylor on the 7-day injured list and activated catcher Chris Betts and pitcher Kyle Hurt.\nWednesday Scores\n\nTacoma 6, Oklahoma City 1\nFrisco 11, Tulsa 0\nGreat Lakes 3, West Michigan 0\nLake Elsinore 4, Rancho Cucamonga 1\n\nThursday Schedule\n\n3:35 p.m.: Great Lakes (River Ryan) at West Michigan (Keider Montero)\n4:35 p.m.: Tulsa (Landon Knack) at Frisco (Cody Bradford)\n5:05 p.m.: Oklahoma City (Jon Duplantier) vs. Tacoma (Tommy Milone)\n6:30 p.m.: Rancho Cucamonga (Chris Campos) vs. Lake Elsinore (Jairo Iriarte)",

        "description": "Like many people on planet Earth, I have been spellbound by the first pictures from the James Webb Space Telescope: the lacelike windings of galaxies, the apricot filaments of nebulae, the remnants of exploded stars. A less picturesque, but still revolutionary, part of Webb’s mission is the search for signs of life elsewhere in the universe. The telescope goes about this momentous quest by analyzing the starlight passing through the atmospheres of distant planets. Each kind of molecule leaves its own telltale imprints on traversing light, and some molecules, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane, may indicate life forms on the planet below. Indeed, Webb has already found evidence of carbon dioxide on at least one planet beyond our solar system.Considering the billions of planets in our galaxy, and the billions of galaxies in the observable universe, few scientists believe that our planet is the only habitat with life. Nonetheless, finding definite evidence of living things elsewhere in the cosmos would have deep emotional and psychological import, as well as philosophical and theological meaning. Such a finding would force us humans to reconsider some of our fundamental beliefs: How do we define “life”? What are the possible varieties of life? Where did we living things come from? Is there some kind of cosmic community?In fact, recent scientific research suggests that life in the universe is rare. A few years ago, using results from the Kepler satellite to estimate the fraction of stars with possibly habitable planets, I calculated that, even if all potentially habitable planets do in fact harbor life, the fraction of matter in the universe in living form is exceedingly small: about one-billionth of one-billionth. That’s like a few grains of sand on the Gobi Desert. Evidently, we living things are a very special arrangement of atoms and molecules.Life may be even rarer than that. In the mid-1970s, the Australian physicist Brandon Carter pointed out that our universe seems particularly fine-tuned for the emergence of life. For example, if the nuclear force holding the centers of atoms together were a little weaker, then the complex atoms needed for life could never form. If it were a little stronger, all of the hydrogen in the infant universe would have fused to become helium. Without hydrogen, water (H2O) would not exist, and most biologists believe that water is necessary for life. As another example of fine-tuning: If the observed “dark energy” that fills the cosmos, discovered in 1998, were a little larger than it actually is, the universe would have expanded so rapidly that matter could never have pulled itself together to make stars, the essential nursery for all the complex atoms thought necessary for life. But with a slightly smaller value of dark energy, the universe would have expanded and recollapsed so quickly that stars wouldn’t have had time to form.Carter’s observation that our universe is finely tuned for the emergence of life has been called the anthropic principle. A profound question raised by the principle is: Why? Why should the universe care whether it contains animate matter? The theological answer to this question is a cosmic form of intelligent design: Our universe was created by an all-powerful and purposeful being, who wanted it to have life. Another explanation, more scientific, is that our universe is but one of a huge number of universes, called the multiverse, which have a wide range of values for the strength of the nuclear force, the amount of dark energy, and many other fundamental parameters. In most of those universes, these values would not lie within the narrow range permitting life to emerge. We live in one of the life-friendly universes because otherwise we wouldn’t be here to ask the question. Our existence, and our universe itself, is simply an accident, one throw of the cosmic dice.[Read: Why Earth’s history appears so miraculous]A similar line of thinking could explain why planet Earth has such favorable conditions for life: liquid water, moderate temperatures (at the moment), plentiful oxygen for higher-level metabolism. The obvious explanation is that there are many planets, even in our own solar system, that do not have liquid water or pleasant temperatures or oxygen atmospheres. Those planets do not harbor life. We are here, to build houses and write novels and ask questions about our own existence, because we live on one of the small fraction of planets that have the right conditions for life. In sum, animate matter is not only rare in our particular universe, but seems to be nonexistent in most possible universes.At the time that Carter published his paper, I had recently finished my graduate work and was doing research in astrophysics at Cornell University.During my two years at Cornell, I lived in an apartment with a large picture window facing Cayuga Lake. Every day, the lake looked different, as if painted by a new artist. I spent hours when I should have been pondering equations staring out at the lake, its fluctuating colors and textures.At Cornell, I met a number of scientific titans, such as Edwin Salpeter, Thomas Gold, and Hans Bethe. Gold, a theoretical astrophysicist and biophysicist born in Vienna in 1920, I got to know pretty well. Tommy was not particularly adept at mathematical calculations, but he was a brilliant and daring intuitionist. Barrel-chested and ruddy-faced when I knew him, with a broad smile, he had strong opinions about nearly everything and did not shirk from thumbing his nose at the scientific establishment. He rapidly threw out new ideas, like darts at a dartboard. Most of them missed the bull’s-eye, but not all.In 1948, Gold partnered with other astrophysicists to challenge the Big Bang theory with a counter theory called the “steady state” theory of cosmology. That theory proposed that the universe never had a beginning. It appears unchanging, even while expanding, because of a hypothesized constant creation of new matter. Steady state was eventually proved wrong. In 1968, Gold correctly hypothesized that the newly discovered pulsing radio waves from space were produced by rapidly rotating neutron stars. In the 1970s, Gold argued that the oil found on Earth did not originate from the decomposition of organic material, as most geologists believe, but was present deep underground when the planet first formed. He even persuaded the Swedish national power company to drill an exploratory well in a meteor crater. The interpretation of the sludge brought forth was highly controversial, and the company went bankrupt.[Read: Where science and miracles meet]I have vivid memories of standing in Tommy’s office, attempting to solve a problem with equations on the blackboard, when he would brush me away with exasperation and pronounce the answer simply by visualizing the problem in his head. Such physical intuition can be found in most scientists, but Tommy possessed it to an astounding degree.Tommy was also good with his hands. He once showed me a beautiful, three-legged chair he’d designed and built, and he explained that all chairs should be made that way. Even if the three legs are not the same length, their ends will sit stably on the floor because three points (the ends of the legs of the chair) define a unique plane (the floor). Add a fourth leg—a fourth point—and, unless it is cut exactly to the right length, its end will not lie in the same plane as the first three. The chair can then wobble back and forth among its four legs, the ends of any three of them lying in the plane of the floor, but the fourth being out of place. In other words, three legs allow only one solution for the position of the chair, but four allow for several.Thinking back on Tommy’s three-legged chair, I realize that it was a perfect metaphor for the single and unique universe that most scientists dreamed of. Physicists, and especially theoretical physicists, would like to think that there is only one possible universe consistent with the fundamental laws of nature, like one unique solution to a crossword puzzle or a chair with only three legs. If so, we would be able to calculate why our universe must be as it is.The possibility that there may be many other universes with different properties, many different solutions to the same fundamental laws of nature, deeply disturbs many scientists. It’s a bit like going into a shoe store and finding that size 3 fits you, but sizes 6 and 11 fit equally well.Modern physicists take great pride in being able to calculate everything from “first principles”—that is, from a few fundamental laws. For example, a physicist can calculate how fast a ball hits the floor when dropped from a height of three feet using a principle known as the “conservation of energy”: The total energy in a closed system is constant, even though that energy may change form. The conservation of energy, in turn, follows from an even deeper principle called “time invariance”: The laws of nature do not change from one moment to the next.Using basic principles, physicists have been able to calculate the color of the sky, the detailed orbits of planets, the strength of magnetism in an electron, and many other phenomena. But if there are many different universes consistent with the same starting principles and laws, then the fundamental nature of our universe is incalculable. Some basic properties of our universe would have to be accidents. Physicists hate accidents. If there were too many accidents, nothing would be predictable. Wheelbarrows might suddenly float in the air. The sun might come up some days and not others. The world would be a frightening place.There’s one more disturbing aspect of the multiverse idea. Even if this multitude of other universes are real, there may well be no way to prove or disprove their existence. By definition, a universe is a self-contained region of space and time that cannot send a signal to another such region even into the infinite future. Thus, a universe cannot communicate with another universe. The hypothesized boatload of universes must be accepted or rejected as a matter of faith. Just as scientists do not like accidents, they dislike being forced to accept things they cannot prove. But the multiverse, and other aspects of this strange cosmos we find ourselves in, may be not only not unknown to us at this moment, but fundamentally unknowable. Although such a notion goes against the long tradition of science, it does offer a bit of humility, which is good medicine for any profession.[Read: Don’t be afraid of the multiverse]The multiverse hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists. But one thing is almost certain: Life in our universe is extremely rare. I have already explained that life is rare in space—only a small fraction of matter exists in living form. Life is also rare in time, in the long unfolding history of the universe. At some point in the future, in perhaps a few hundred billion years, after all of the stars have burned out and all sources of energy have been exhausted, life in our universe will end—not just life similar to that on Earth, but life of all kinds. The “era of life” will have passed.What should we make of this realization? For me, it offers a feeling of kinship with all living things. We living things are the only mechanism by which the universe can observe itself. We living things, a few grains of sand on the desert, are that special arrangement of atoms and molecules that can attempt to fathom and record this dazzling spectacle of existence. In a limited but real sense, we living things help give the universe meaning. Without us, the cosmos would merely be.​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

        "description": "In August, the author Salman Rushdie was stabbed in the neck. The novelist has spent decades living under the threat of a hit put out by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989. The religious directive was a response to Rushdie’s novel The Satanic Verses, which Khomeini regarded as blasphemous. For many, the attack was an opportunity to reflect on the importance of free expression, and a reminder of the clear distinction between speech and violence.For others, it was an opportunity to remind others of the clear distinction between speech and violence, which is something that all those snowflake libs, who are sort of like the fanatic who stabbed Rushdie in the neck, should take to heart.“We live in a culture in which many of the most celebrated people occupying the highest perches believe that words are violence,” Bari Weiss wrote on her Substack, citing no one in particular. “In this, they have much in common with Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.” She added that “of course it is 2022 that the Islamists finally get a knife into Salman Rushdie. Of course it is now, when words are literally violence and J.K. Rowling literally puts trans lives in danger and even talking about anything that might offend anyone means you are literally arguing I shouldn’t exist.”As an outlet, The Atlantic attempts to provide readers with a broad spectrum of perspectives based on shared values. One of these values is freedom of speech, a principle to which I and all of my cherished colleagues are deeply committed. The assassination attempt on Rushdie was a direct attack on that freedom, and it should be no surprise that writers here have a great deal to say about it. But I must respectfully disagree with some of my colleagues about the conclusions they have drawn from the attack, linking contemporary left-wing discourse with a fundamentalist theocrat’s call for assassination.[Read: Rushdie’s challenge to Islamic orthodoxy]My colleague Graeme Wood pointed to Jimmy Carter’s 1989 op-ed criticizing Rushdie to argue that “over the past two decades, our culture has been Carterized. We have conceded moral authority to howling mobs, and the louder the howls, the more we have agreed that the howls were worth heeding.” He acknowledged, however, that “since the attempt on Rushdie’s life, almost no one has advanced these arguments,” meaning a link between the emotional injury of blasphemy and the very literal violence of murder. If our society were truly “Carterized,” I would have expected instead to have seen some prominent American figures make the argument Carter did decades ago.Another one of my colleagues, Caitlin Flanagan, settled for an exegesis of the views of the Twitter user @MeerAsifAziz1, whose account no longer exists. She argued that “the culture of free speech is eroding every day,” and offered a hypothetical example: “Ask an Oberlin student—fresh outta Shaker Heights, coming in hot, with a heart as big as all outdoors and a 3 in AP Bio—to tell you what speech is acceptable, and she’ll tell you that it’s speech that doesn’t hurt the feelings of anyone belonging to a protected class.”I’ll make no secret that I believe the focus on the misguided egalitarianism of undergraduates at private colleges has been disproportionate. People like this exist, though, and it’s fair to criticize them. What I frankly find puzzling is presenting this hypothetical student as the avatar of the idea that dangerous speech and ideas must be suppressed, when in statehouses and governors’ mansions, politicians who have the authority to enforce their ideas about censorship with state power are actually putting them into practice. Unlike the hypothetical Oberlin student, these officials are real, and the threat they pose to free speech is not only clear and present, but backed by a certain level of popular demand.I agree with Weiss and Wood and Flanagan that there is a bright line between speech and violence that must be respected, and that trying to kill someone for offending you is monstrous. Speech is not violence, and to argue so is to imply that violence is an appropriate response. The unacknowledged reality of these three essays, however, is that what I just stated remains the broad, widely held consensus in American life, from right to left. Americans simply do not live under anything resembling the kind of repression in which people are killed for blasphemy with state or popular support.[Caitlin Flanagan: America’s fire sale: Get some free speech while you can]Weiss, Wood, and Flanagan also noted the objection of a group of writers and thinkers to the PEN association bestowing an award on Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical publication that terrorists attacked in 2015 over its caricatures of the Muslim prophet Muhammad, murdering 12 people, including several staff members, police officers, a maintenance worker, and someone who was visiting that day. The letter signers described the massacre as “sickening and tragic” while criticizing PEN for “valorizing selectively offensive material: material that intensifies the anti-Islamic, anti-Maghreb, anti-Arab sentiments already prevalent in the Western world.”Weiss attacked the “civic cowardice” of those who objected, while Flanagan wrote that these writers were pressuring the organization to “abandon its mission” of protecting freedom of expression. Wood described the writers’ position as muddling “the distinction between offense and violence, and between a disagreement over ideas and a disagreement over whether your head should remain attached to your body.”  I would not have signed that letter if asked, not only because I do not sign open letters, as a matter of preference, but because I believe that blasphemy is a human right, and that the message that PEN was sending with the award was an endorsement not of Charlie Hebdo’s content but of the staff’s bravery in the face of an attempt to silence them through murder. But just as I have no objection to the award, I have no issue with people criticizing it because they do not want it to be interpreted as an endorsement of the racist caricatures Charlie Hebdo is known for, even accepting that they are intended with a layer of irony. (I’m not sure how many of the people disseminating these images are aware of the irony.) These may be mutually exclusive positions, but both are consistent with respecting free speech. Indeed, both the writers of the letter and its critics are arguing that there are things you can say but should not.One of the significant measures of free speech in a given society is how people deal with blasphemy—whether religious offense provokes state censorship or violence. America has a relatively strong record in that respect in comparison with much of the rest of the world, while clearly faltering in others. The suggestion here, however, is that the writers who objected to the award granted to Charlie Hebdo are in some sense justifying the massacre, and therefore defending the notion that violence is an appropriate response to offensive speech. But surely one can defend the right of Nazis to publicly protest while rejecting the tenets of national socialism. If I cannot defend the fundamental right of a speaker to be offensive while objecting to their speech, then what am I actually defending?In this case, the rights being asserted seem to be the right to be offensive, and the right of the offended to shut up and like it. The former combined with the latter is not an assertion of the right to free speech so much as a right to monologue, which I do not recognize.The American culture of free speech is indeed under threat, as Flanagan argued. Free speech requires a robust exchange of views without the coercion of threats and violence, and self-censorship in response to social pressure is a genuine risk. Yet by definition, there is no free speech if one person is allowed to make an argument and another is not allowed to object to it. Nor has there ever been a time in American history when freedom of speech was not threatened with proscription by the state, or when one could express a controversial opinion and not risk social sanction. In short, the culture of free speech is always under threat.In almost every era of U.S. history, the bounds of free expression have been contested. In the founding era, patriots tarred and feathered royalists. Before the Civil War, southern states passed laws that could be used to prosecute the dissemination of abolitionist literature and sought to prevent the Postal Service from delivering antislavery pamphlets, saying they would foment insurrection by the enslaved. Mobs followed the abolitionist Frederick Douglass across the North, throwing rotten eggs, stones, and menacing slurs at the orator at speaking events.  After Reconstruction, white supremacists destroyed the office of Ida B. Wells’s newspaper, The Free Speech and Headlight, following the publication of an editorial arguing that lynchings of Black men accused of raping white women were in fact punishment for consensual relationships. The Red Scares of the 20th century saw Americans forced from their jobs and prosecuted for leftist beliefs or sympathies on the grounds that those were tantamount to a commitment to overthrowing the government. Out of that crucible emerged a civil libertarian concept of free speech that many have mistaken for timeless rather than a product of a certain history and a particular arrangement of political power. The idea that certain forms of speech or expression justify or provoke violence, let alone that blasphemy does so, is not an invention of modern social-justice discourse.Every generation faces a different challenge when it comes to freedom of expression. Ours includes not only the widespread and growing campaign of state censorship led by Republican lawmakers, but a social-media panopticon that can both deny us the privacy necessary to come to our own conclusions and inhibit the courage necessary to express them. Most of us are not meant to be privy to every misguided utterance of a stranger, nor are we meant to have our errors or worst moments evaluated publicly by people who learned of our existence only as the focus of political propaganda, as the subject of ridicule, or as acceptable targets in pointless feuds between online cliques. (Although it must be said, there are those who thrive in such conditions, and have successfully exploited them for fame, profit, and status.)Yet, as Aaron R. Hanlon recently wrote in The New Republic, this wave of censorship laws in Republican-controlled states bears scant mention among many of the most prominent self-styled defenders of free speech, or at least, far less than the tyranny of the ratio. But we do not become little Rushdies when our inboxes and mentions are inundated with deranged filth from disturbed strangers, as a result of the public-facing profession we chose and the technological advancements that make us more accessible to such people.It is not minimizing the power of digital mobs to say that spending decades with the state-backed threat of an assassin’s blade at your throat is coercion of a different magnitude. The wrath of an online mob can be harrowing: harassment, outrageous falsehoods, and threats are not pleasant to bear, and can threaten not just your mental health but your livelihood, and in extreme cases your safety. To pretend that seeking to avoid such an experience does not condition what people say and how they act would be foolish. But to pretend that this is a left-wing ideological phenomenon rather than a structural one, when educators, medical providers, election officials, and others from all walks of life are being driven underground by right-wing influencers who can conduct a mob like an orchestra, would be equally foolish.The United States is living through the largest wave of state censorship since the second Red Scare. Beyond the plague of education gag laws restricting the teaching of unpleasant facts about American history, conservative judges seek to rewrite constitutional free-speech protections to punish the “liberal” media, and conservative states pass laws against public protest and immunize from liability those who would run over protesters with their cars, while law-enforcement organizations hope to use civil lawsuits to sue demonstrations against police brutality out of existence. Conservatives have sought to fire librarians and purge public libraries of books they deem controversial by categorizing them as obscene, as state officials try to punish teachers who provide their students with public information that allows them to access samizdat from libraries in states where it is not forbidden. Not only do abortion bounty laws seek to enforce silence around reproductive health, lest a person discussing the subject prick the ears of some snitch seeking a payday, but the overturning of Roe has coincided with explicit attempts to criminalize speech about abortion. In the strongest labor market in a generation, billionaires seek to use their power and authority to crush workers organizing for better conditions and a living wage.[Adam Serwer: The myth that Roe broke America]There is no shortage of major free-speech issues to address in America today, but many of us in the writing profession are primarily concerned with our social-media experience, because that is what we most directly and frequently encounter. Instead of recognizing that the warped behavioral incentives created by social media are a structural problem, we tend to blame the people online who annoy us the most. In many cases, those defending “free speech” are not defending freedom of expression so much as seeking the power to determine which views can be publicly expressed without backlash, and which can be silenced without reproach. When we speak of an idealized past without chilling effects, we are simply imagining a time when the social consensus was repressive and stifling for someone else.These conflicts are far more complex precisely because there is no clear line where social pressure from those exercising their rights of free speech and association crosses over into censoriousness. State censorship and violent compulsion are relatively easy to identify and oppose, if not always easy to prevent. When does accountability become harassment? When does protest become coercion? What views should be acceptable to state in polite society, and which should be appropriately shunned by decent people? When does a voice of criticism become the howl of a mob? When does corporate speech become corporate censorship? No society in human history has ever had simple answers to these questions. In a free society, sometimes people will choose to be horrible, and there is little to do other than make a different choice and counsel people to do the same.Presenting these dilemmas as similar to an attempt to silence someone with a theocratic death mark is trivializing, and ahistorical. There has never been a golden age when anyone could say what they wanted without consequence, only eras in which one shared perspective was dominant. Though nostalgia may cloud our perceptions, those times were no more free, even if politics, ideology, or self-promotion might compel us to remember otherwise.",

The first time was July 3 in Wrigley Field, which is one of the most iconic sports venues in the entire world. This time was September 7, in Coca-Cola Park, which gives all of its various concession stands and club seating areas pig-themed names, e.g. The Bud Light Trough, the Pig Pen, and The Bacon Strip.

It’s nothing to be too worried about, because he’s one of the youngest players of the league and, even with the disconcerting strikeouts (27 in 22 games), he’s still managed to hit 3 homers and put up a .340 OBP, but it is something to keep in mind before we pencil prospects into the 2024 depth chart. \nSalem, L 10-8\n\nRomero, 2B: 2-5, 2B, 3B, 2 RBI, 2 K\nBonaci, SS: 0-3, 1 R, 2 BB, 1 K, SB\nPaulino, 2B: 1-5, 1 R, 0 BB, 2 K\nMeidroth, DH: 1-5, 1 R, 2 K\n\n\n\nPerales: 3 IP, 5 H, 4 R, 2 ER, 0 BB, 4 K\nTalavera: 1.2 IP, 3 H, 6 R, 1 ER, 2 BB\nLucas: 3.1 IP, 1 H, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K\nTellier: 1 IP, 1 H, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K\n\nSomeone who has not struggled jumping up a level, on the other hand, is Mikey Romero.

        "description": "Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  It was a rough day on Wednesday for the Buccos.  I don’t think anyone is suprised to see that the Pittsburgh Pirates struggled to score runs in their Wednesday double-header against the New York Mets. The season-long issue continued in a 5-1 defeat in the afternoon game and a 10-0 loss in the nightcap. \nIn the first game, the Buccos were already down 5-0 before scoring their only run in the bottom of the sixth inning off of a Tyler Heineman single. \nBefore that, it was Duane Underwood giving up a run to the Mets in the first inning in a bullpen start. He wound up with the loss to fall to 1-6 on the year. He was followed by Bryse Wilson, who gave up a three-run homer to Tyler Naquin and a solo shot to Edurado Escobar in the fourth. \nOneil Cruz and Michael Chavis both went 2-for-4 as your only multi-hit Buccos. The Pirates had seven total hits in the game. \nIn the nightcap, there’s not much to report, particularly behind the plate, where the Bucs only snagged four hits on the evening, two of which came from Bryan Reynolds. Pittsburgh only had two runners in scoring position the entire game, of which they of course went 0-for-2. Oneil Cruz did snag a single to extend his hitting streak to five games. \nAnd here’s the question of the day. What was worse, the hitting or the pitching?\nJohan Oviedo got the start and only lasted one and two-thirds innings, giving up four runs on just one hit, but he walked five batters, including walking in a run, and also had a wild pitch that allowed another run to score. Ugly stuff. \nZach Thompson, Tyler Beede, and Yohan Ramirez gave up three, two, and one runs respectively out of the bullpen, with only Eric Stout getting out un-scored upon.\nThe Bucs did get a win out of the series, but Wednesday’s doubleheader was some bad baseball, even by Pirates standards. \nPittsburgh is off today, but will be back in action tomorrow against the St. Louis Cardinals.",

        "description": "Photo by Cliff Welch/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Yankees have built their minor league system up the middle, but is shortstop or center field the stronger position group in the minor league system?  Over the last few years, the Yankees have made a concerted effort to build their farm system up the middle. They have used high draft picks and big parts of their international bonus pool to bring in talented young players with high ceilings. Now six of the Yankees’ top-seven prospects according to MLB.com play either shortstop or center field, making those by far the best position groups in the Yankees’ system. As the minor league season approaches it’s conclusion, what group is the best in the system? \nThe shortstop contingent is led by the Yankees’ top overall prospect, Anthony Volpe. After a short professional debut following the 2019 draft, Volpe put in a ton of work during the pandemic-canceled season to improve his game. He exploded in 2021 and by the middle of the season was considered by virtually all scouts as not only the team's best prospect, but one of the best in all of baseball. \nNext up is Oswald Peraza, who recently made his major league debut, and after a slow first couple of games looks to be finding his stride with the bat and glove.  He should see plenty of playing time moving forward, but will likely retain his prospect status through the end of the season. Peraza was the Yankees’ number two prospect heading into the season but after a slow start at the Triple-A level he was bumped down to the third spot in MLB.com’s mid-season rankings. \n\n\n1st of many! Congrats Oswald!    pic.twitter.com/BzdMPKDVac— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nIn his last 52 minor league games Peraza hit .316/.382/.560 with 14 home runs and 22 stolen bases. He clearly turned a corner against Triple-A pitching and has long been known for his strong throwing arm and defense up the middle. \nRounding out the shortstop contingent is the Yankees’ first-round pick from 2021, Trey Sweeney. He has yet to put a full season of offensive numbers, but has played well since the beginning of June, and turned it up another notch over his last 19 games where he hit .300/.443/.486. It is still questionable if Sweeney will remain at shortstop in the long term or move to another position, but he has remained up the middle into the upper levels of the minors. MLB.com ranks Sweeney as the Yankees’ sixth-best prospect. \n\n\nTrey Sweeney gets us going with a leadoff double but left stranded, through 1 at the dutch.0-0 pic.twitter.com/qLzyz3n4cs— Hudson Valley Renegades (@HVRenegades) August 30, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Yankees’ center field prospects are led by 19-year-old Jasson Domínguez. The Yankees’ top international prospect signing in 2019 finally made his professional debut in 2021 playing in the Florida Complex League and with Low-A Tampa. While some scouts and fans soured on him as he failed to live up to the unreasonable expectations that surrounded his signing, he has bounced back in a big way in 2022. \nAfter a terrible start to the season, Domínguez picked it up by the end of April and then took it to another level in mid-May. Over his last 84 games he has hit .288/.408/.458, with nine home runs. He has also dramatically reduced his strikeout rate from 2021 and has been impressive across the board. While the power in terms of extra-base hits has not fully shown up yet, Domínguez routinely records big time exit velocities while being tracked by StatCast in the Florida State League.\nA few years prior to the Yankees signing Domínguez, they used one of their top international bonuses to sign Everson Pereira. Pereira’s tools impressed numerous scouts and he earned an advanced assignment for a 17-year-old in 2018 during his professional debut, but the numbers did not jump off the page early on. That changed in 2021 as Pereira put up massive power numbers after getting a late start to the season, needing just 188 at-bats to hit 20 home runs while climbing to the High-A level. \n\n\nDon’t let Everson Pereira get hot The Yankees No. 5 prospect goes deep with his fifth Double-A home run to put us up 2-1! pic.twitter.com/GLILRyIgMP— Somerset Patriots (@SOMPatriots) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nWhile the power has not been as dynamic this season, Pereira has climbed to the Double-A level and has a .937 OPS over his last 54 games. He has the speed and ability to man center field.\nIn the most recent MLB draft the Yankees selected Vanderbilt outfielder Spencer Jones. Jones was a corner outfielder in college due to playing alongside perhaps the best defensive center fielder in the college ranks, but he immediately moved to center field upon joining the organization. Jones’ bat did not skip a beat as he joined the pro ranks, hitting .940 OPS as a professional while providing some of the hardest hit balls in the Yankees minor league system this year already. He is expected to move quickly through the lower levels of the minors.  \nWhen we line the positions up against each other it is an interesting look. The two highest ceilings likely belong to Domínguez and Jones due to their potential to be a combination of dynamic power and strong on-base skills. Both will have to show that they can continue to do it at the higher levels of the minor leagues, while getting to the power in game action more often.  \nAnthony Volpe is considered the surest thing among all the Yankees prospects to contribute at the major league level. Peraza’s defense and ability to impact the ball also give him a floor of a major league contributor for a long time, and a ceiling of much more. \nThe Yankees have built their farm system up the middle in recent years. The results are showing at the top of the MLB.com prospect’s list as many of the team’s top young players are either shortstops or center fielders. Both groups boast high ceiling players who have the potential to help the Yankees in both the short and long term. It looks to me like the shortstops are more likely to contribute at the MLB level while the center fielders could have the bigger impact in the long run, if they can reach their ceiling. What do you think?",

        "description": "Anthony Castro in action for his previous team, the Guardians. | Photo by Chase Agnello-Dean/Getty Images\n    \n\n  If you put a reliever who strikes out a lot of guys but also walks too many on waivers, Mike Elias may grab him. Over the offseason, Camden Chat published an article about each member of the Orioles 40-man roster. During the 2022 season, we will update on new arrivals after they make it to the roster.\nHow he arrived: Waiver claim from Cleveland Guardians, 9/3/22\nWho left: Phoenix Sanders designated for assignment, 9/3/22\nThe Orioles have assembled a solid bullpen this year out of players who arrived in the organization by waiver claim. Some of these guys have been better than others, but as a group the Orioles are where they are thanks to this bunch: Bryan Baker, Joey Krehbiel, Jorge López, and Cionel Pérez. Though the O’s are no longer at the top of the waiver wire priority list, Mike Elias has not stopped trying to mine this vein for some kind of useful piece.\nThe latest arrival is Anthony Castro, a 27-year-old righty reliever from Venezuela who brings 38 games of big league experience into the organization. Castro is the eighth pitcher claimed by the O’s since the 2022 campaign began. One of these, Austin Voth, has carved out a role for himself. The others have mostly been one-or-two-and-done relief depth guys. The O’s elite talent pipeline has not yet generated a steady supply of internal reliever options, so they keep looking elsewhere. Finding relievers from other teams may well be the philosophe.\nA very simple demonstration of this kind of “wave while walking through the revolving door without actually stopping and getting out” tenure is the guy Castro replaced on the 40-man roster, Phoenix Sanders. He was claimed, sent to the minors, and waived within two weeks. Unless, like me, you lodged Sanders in your memory because his first name is Phoenix, you probably forgot about him.\nCastro’s contact with the MLB level up until now has not been very successful. His 38 games have left him with a 6.00 ERA. That’s been fueled largely by his having a 7.43 ERA in 12 games this season. Not every pitcher is going to turn into Voth, but Voth going from a 5.70 career ERA pitcher, and 10.13 this season before joining the Orioles, to what we’ve seen from him, shows that the Orioles can pull off the revival, sometimes. Most will not be revied, but you don’t know until you try.\nThere are some strengths for Castro amidst the challenges. For his career, he’s working with a ground ball rate of 48.2%. Ground balls are good! He’s also shown the capability to be a strikeout pitcher. Last year with the Blue Jays, Castro struck out 32 batters in 24.2 innings, and he had a K/BB ratio of 4. The Orioles perhaps think they can work with that, along with Castro’s 73rd percentile fastball velocity and 86th percentile fastball spin rate.\nIf there was more good news in Castro’s performance, I would share it. There isn’t. His smaller 2022 sample slipped substantially, with his strikeout rate falling by more than a third and his walk rate more than doubling. The command problem was matched even at the Triple-A level, where Castro walked 20 batters in 29.2 innings this season. Castro’s also been bitten by the home run bug. He gave up five home runs in his limited MLB action this season.\nGiven all of that, it seems more likely that Castro is seen as more of a medium-term development project at best, not a short-term option. Ship him to Norfolk, maybe tweak his pitch mix, maybe change up a couple of other small things, and see what starts happening. \nMost of the O’s pitcher waiver claims this season have been relievers who’ve been asked to cover gaps when a fresh arm was needed at the MLB level. Beau Sulser, Louis Head, Logan Allen. You don’t need to buy one of their jerseys unless you’re one of those people who enjoys the weird irony of wearing an ultra-obscure jersey. Castro seems likely to fit into this group, if he doesn’t end up in the Sanders group of being waived again before he even pitches at the MLB level for the team once.\nAccording to the Roster Resource depth charts, Castro is on his final minor league option year this season. That means that if he’s still hanging around on the 40-man roster at the end of spring training next year, he’ll have to either make the MLB team or be passed through waivers. \nStill to come: Jake Reed",

        "description": "Photo by Norm Hall/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Drew Lugbauer led a power-filled night down in the Braves’ minor league system. There were plenty of highlights on both sides of the ball as the Braves’ minor league affiliates went a combined 4-1. Drew Lugbauer and Hernan Perez each had two homer games, Rome got a pair of grand slams and great pitching in both halves of their doubleheader, and Augusta was able to win a close one in extra innings. Lets get into the games.\n\nGwinnett Stripers 7, Buffalo Bisons 10\nBox Score\n\nHernan Perez, 3B: 3-5, 2 HR, 4 RBI, 3 R, .766 OPS\nRyan Goins, SS: 3-4, RBI, R, .522 OPS\nFreddy Tarnok, SP: 3 IP, 6 H, 7 ER, 2 BB, 3 K, 4.00 ERA\nJared Shuster, RP: 4 IP, 4 H, 3 ER, 1 BB, 4 K, 4.15 ERA\n\n\nIt was a tough night for Freddy Tarnok on the mound as Gwinnett fell to Buffalo by the score of 10-7. The first three innings from Tarnok were mediocre, but at least passable, but things went very awry in the fourth where Tarnok allowed the first five hitters to reach base including giving up a grand slam which is obviously not great. Freddy was having trouble commanding his pitches, so when he went to dial things back in an effort to do so, the Bisons jumped all over him. One weird note here: Jared Shuster came in in relief to pitch the final four innings of this game. This was likely due to a combination of the weather issues, wanting to line up certain guys later on in the week, and accounting for Mike Soroka’s rehab start and NOT indicative of a prolonged switch. Also, he did not pitch particularly well with the bulk of the damage coming on a two-run homer he gave up in the sixth inning.\nOffensively, it was the Hernan Perez show as he connected for two home runs on Wednesday evening and drove in four of Gwinnett’s seven runs. Perez is coming off a really strong month of August and while he is not exactly a prospect at 31 years old, he has seen time at seven different positions at Gwinnett this season and can hit a bit which makes him an interesting org depth piece. Ryan Goins had a three hit night to help the cause as well.\n\nMississippi Braves 13, Biloxi Shuckers 2\nBox Score\n\nDrew Lugbauer, 1B: 3-4, 2 HR, 5 RBI, BB, .780 OPS\nLogan Brown, C: 1-4, HR, 3 RBI, BB, 2 R, .505 OPS\nAndrew Moritz, RF: 4-5, 2B, HR, 2 RBI, 3 R, .759 OPS\nDylan Dodd, SP: 5 IP, 8 H, 2 ER, 1 BB, 5 K, 3.27 ERA\n\n\nMississippi’s offense exploded in the last two innings for eight runs as the Braves trounced Biloxi by the final score of 13-2. Dylan Dodd was on the mound for Mississippi and while he wasn’t quite as dominant as he was in his previous start, he was still very solid through five innings of work. Dodd has not given up more than two earned runs since July nor has he struck out less than a batter per inning in a start since June. The Mississippi bullpen locked things down from there as Creasy, Higginbotham, Wilcox, and Puckett combined for four scoreless innings of relief.\nOn offense, Drew Lugbauer had one of those games he has sometimes as he connected for two homers while driving in five runs in the game. Those two homers put him at 26 on the season and hopefully is a sign that he is coming out of the funk he was in for essentially the entire month of August. Andrew Moritz had a four hit night including his second home run of the season and Logan Brown got in on the fun as well with his first homer of 2022. Weirdly enough, the only guy in Mississippi’s lineup that didn’t contribute in this game is Cade Bunnell who has been one of Mississippi’s most consistent offensive producers ever since he got promoted. Baseball is weird sometimes. \n\nRome Braves 5, Hickory Crawdads 0 - Game One\nBox Score\n\nBryson Horne, 1B: 1-2, HR, 4 RBI, BB, .706 OPS\nCal Conley, SS: 1-3, HR, RBI, .756 OPS\nLuis De Avila, SP: 6 IP, 4 H, 0 ER, 1 BB, 8 K, 3.49 ERA\n\n\nRome Braves 8, Hickory Crawdads 2 - Game Two\nBox Score\n\nGeraldo Quintero, 2B: 2-4, HR, 4 RBI, .763 OPS\nBryson Horne, 1B: 2-4, 2B, RBI, R, .711 OPS\nRoyber Salinas, SP: 5 IP, 1 H, 0 ER, 1 BB, 6 K, 4.11 ERA\n\n\nRome dominated on both sides of the ball in their doubleheader with Hickory as they swept the twin bill by the scores of 5-0 and 8-2. Luis De Avila got the start in the first game and he was coming off a start where he struck out 10 batters in six scoreless innings. He did not disappoint on Wednesday as he went six scoreless AGAIN while striking out eight batters. De Avila has been intermittently awesome this season and with his recent dominance, he is making the Braves looking awfully smart for selecting him in the minor league portion of the Rule 5 draft. Royber Salinas started the second game for Rome and threw five scoreless innings of his own with six strikeouts. Efficiency is definitely a concern with Salinas as he tends to throw a lot of pitches in search of strikeouts and a move to the bullpen feels a little inevitable to some of us, but Wednesday was a step in the right direction as he got through his five innings on just 74 pitches.\nRome got a pair of grand slams in their doubleheader which generally portends good things. In game one, the bulk of Rome’s offense came on Bryson Horne’s grand slam in the second inning. Horne would go on to have a pair of hits in game two as well, so he had himself a lovely day. In the second game, it was Geraldo Quintero who connected for a bases-clearing homer of his own for his second home run in high-A to help Rome explode for seven runs in the fifth inning of game two.   \n\nAugusta GreenJackets 3, Kannapolis Cannon Ballers 2 - F/10\nBox Score\n\nMahki Backstrom, 1B: 2-4, 2B, 3B, RBI, .772 OPS\nNoah Williams, RF: 3-4, 2B, RBI\nLandon Harper, SP: 2.2 IP, 7 H, 2 ER, 1 BB, 3 K, 7.20 ERA\n\n\nAugusta had to battle more than Mississippi and Rome did, but they managed to score the tying run in the ninth and the winning run in the 10th to secure a 3-2 win over Kannapolis. Landon Harper got the start for Augusta and he struggled with a lot of baserunners while failing to finish the third inning although the damage was limited to just two runs. The Augusta bullpen crew of James Acuna, Juan Mateo, and Estarlin Rodriguez were the unsung heroes of this game as they combined for 7.1 innings of scoreless relief to keep Augusta in the game.\nIt was a night somewhat sparse in terms of offensive highlights for the GreenJackets although there were some key moments that helped Augusta steal this one. Mahki Backstrom had a two extra-base hit night including an RBI triple that tied the game in the top of the ninth inning. Noah Williams, the Braves’ 18th round pick in the 2022 MLB Draft, made his Augusta debut and promptly had a three hit night including an RBI double in the 10th inning which proved to be the winning run in the game.",

(credit: John Timmer)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I was trying to figure out how to position the Urtopia Carbon e-bike so it could get enough signal to join my Wi-Fi network and download new firmware, I took a moment to ponder what would have happened if Apple had taken a tiny fraction of the money it has reportedly spent on its rumored electric car project and diverted it into making an e-bike instead. What would years of experience with mobile computing, hardware/software integration, maps and voice commands, and more mean for a bike?\nUrtopia is clearly trying to make software one of the Carbon's differentiating features, but the company is still in the learning stages. There are some interesting ideas in the software, and it's hosted on a pretty solid e-bike platform. But the package needs a bit more refinement and integration.\nThe bike\nThe Carbon's design is something that only became possible with the advent of carbon fiber frames, and it's certainly a striking bike. In theory, the joints between the different sections of the tube could be engineered to provide enough flex to absorb some shocks. But the Carbon is probably the stiffest e-bike I've ever tested. (I also may have made the ride a bit bumpier by inflating the tires too much, since I was unable to find any indication of what the preferred pressure was.)Read 26 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "The CDC should undergo four vital reforms, write Sandro Galea, dean of Boston University&#8217;s School of Public Health and Georgetown University’s Lawrence O. Gostin:\nOn August 17, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky acknowledged the CDC&#8217;s flawed response to the COVID-19 pandemic and announced an agency-wide restructuring.\nWe applaud Walensky for the courage to reexamine and overhaul the agency&#8217;s structure and organizational culture. While we recognize it is far easier to critique complex organizations from the outside, and far more difficult for those charged with articulating and implementing agency mission, we offer four reforms we see as vital to the CDC&#8217;s renewal as the nation&#8217;s premier public health agency.\nThe nation&#8217;s public health system has been in decline for decades, with funding for the core functions decreasing over several presidential administrations, and with professional staff feeling exhausted and undervalued during the COVID-19 pandemic. An underfunded, fragmented public health system, with often clashing federal, state, and territorial jurisdictions had already shown signs of fragility, and was barely able to contain Ebola in 2014 when travel-related cases arrived from West Africa.\nWhen faced with COVID-19, the greatest public health crisis of our lifetimes, the United States was one of the world&#8217;s worst performers. From faulty COVID-19 test kits early in the pandemic and weak data systems throughout, to confusing health messages, the CDC could not meet the moment of an unprecedented health crisis. And the agency repeated many of the same failures during the ongoing monkeypox response. The nation needs a high-level, 9/11-type commission to learn the lessons of COVID-19. But for now, we offer a perspective on what the agency&#8217;s precise failings have been and how it can lead directly to solutions in four crucial areas.\n1. Professional health communication and inclusive engagement\nClear and authoritative health communication is perhaps the most important responsibility of public health, particularly so during emergencies. And yet, the nation&#8217;s, and arguably the world&#8217;s, premier public health agency stumbled time and again on communicating useful and timely information—ranging from airborne transmission, masks, and isolation to business and school closures. Poor communication has also been a feature in the monkeypox response, especially for LGBTQIA+ communities at greatest risk. The CDC has an organizational culture and capabilities that have prioritized expertise in peer-reviewed research over health education. And the agency has been unable to get its messages heard and believed in an age of social media, when ideas disseminate rapidly in distilled form, quickly overwhelming complex messages buried many web pages deep.\nHow does the agency address this challenge? Clearly, the CDC needs to have in-house experienced communication experts who are actually in charge of communication. In addition to such expertise, the agency needs structural streamlining to ensure that the director, or her designate, can speak quickly and effectively on rapidly evolving threats and that the agency&#8217;s full suite of communication materials align promptly with that messaging. Ensuring effective health communication also requires ongoing active and inclusive engagement with at-risk communities. Meaningful engagement also requires the agency to invest in staff who build relationships that can facilitate communication long before a crisis occasions the need for rapid communication.\n2. Strong leadership in the face of jurisdictional challenges\nOne of the sentinel challenges the national public health response faced during COVID-19 was fragmentation of the US public health system. While the CDC is the nation&#8217;s public health agency, states, tribes, and territories have their own health departments and jurisdictional responsibilities. Our constitutional design places primacy in state, tribal, and local public health agencies. The CDC cannot engage in many jurisdictions unless it is explicitly invited to do so. It cannot force state agencies to share data. This led to the proliferation of different approaches to COVID-19 across the country, which played an enormous role in sowing confusion and mistrust.\nWe recognize that this problem extends well beyond the CDC, but only the CDC has the moral and normative authority to build the partnerships that can avoid chaotic and disparate responses across the country when faced with future health emergencies. Fundamentally, the country would be well served, particularly early during a crisis, by a federal agency that speaks clearly and for the whole country, with partners throughout the country aligning their messages and actions with those of the CDC. Even if there were differences in intrastate approaches, such differences can well be explained within broader coherent frameworks that simply were not the case during COVID-19. To achieve greater national coherence will require substantial efforts to build partnerships and systems of coordination and communication well before the next crisis hits. It also calls for substantial federal investment in CDC personnel tasked with creating the necessary coalitions and activating them when needed.\n3. Modern data systems\nA corollary of the fragmented public health system across the country is the fragmentation of data across the nation. Time and again, the CDC has not been able to provide timely and authoritative policy recommendations based on sound data. Consequently, streamlined and modernized data systems throughout the agency and across all of the country&#8217;s health agencies must be a sentinel priority. Even more challenging will be the need to integrate data from clinical settings through claims databases and electronic health record systems. While the CDC cannot compel states to share data, it can incentivize states to report data and marshal cooperation across other federal agencies, including Medicaid, Medicare, and the Veterans Administration. In addition to having comprehensive data and modern data systems, the agency needs to ensure it has the expertise to use these data optimally. Public health agencies broadly, and the CDC in particular, are lagging behind private sector actors with ready access to approaches, such as artificial intelligence to find patterns in data. Several public sector agencies like the Department of Defense are investing heavily in these approaches and the CDC should do likewise. This will require considerable investments in modern data systems and a new data-first approach to CDC functions going forward.\n4. A renewed workforce\nThe CDC has long prided itself on having the best public health workforce in the world. We have deep admiration for CDC staff who have worked tirelessly throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, facing harsh (and often unfounded) criticism in the public sphere. The excellence of CDC staff can be celebrated, while also recognizing that the world&#8217;s public health needs are changing faster than our workforce&#8217;s ability to deal with these challenges, especially fast-moving novel pathogens.\nThis is a moment for an honest appraisal of the skill sets currently within the CDC, the skill sets needed to complement and expand them, and how to create a pipeline of future CDC staff who are poised to stay ahead of public health threats. There is a broad range of expertise that appears to be weak or missing at the CDC, including mathematical modeling, systems and data science, high-end laboratory methods, and &#8220;omics&#8221; capabilities (the capacity for rapid characterization of a range of biological molecules to better understand organisms). Had the CDC possessed this in-house expertise, it would have performed considerably better, for example, in developing a rapid COVID-19 test, identifying SARS-CoV-2 variants, and making more accurate infectious disease projections.\nThe agency&#8217;s failure to be first and most authoritative in all of these areas deeply shaped CDC functioning, as well as the public&#8217;s perception of the agency, during COVID-19. This will require an honest wholesale assessment of what public health staffing of the future looks like and the implementation of a plan to get there. This will not be easy, particularly due to low staff morale and a long-standing culture of doing things a certain way. The culture of remote work, wherein most CDC staff are not in Atlanta, Georgia, [home of the CDC&#8217;s headquarters], has contributed to the CDC&#8217;s challenges. Changing organizational culture will not be easy or popular, but it is badly needed to make the CDC fit for purpose in the 21st century.\nWalensky&#8217;s overhaul of the CDC is a defining moment for the agency&#8217;s future. We would encourage a reform process that is transparent and evidence-based, focusing on maximal public health impact. The reform process, therefore, must start with a clear articulation of what is to be fixed and what the goals of a revitalized agency should be. But the CDC&#8217;s renewal cannot take place in Atlanta alone. It will require a whole-of-government approach, as well as a nation that wants the agency to succeed and will do what it takes to help it do so. If the COVID-19 pandemic taught us nothing else, it should be that our collective well-being and security are intimately connected to a highly professional national public health agency. The CDC has always been the world&#8217;s envy. There is a reason that, from China to Africa and Europe, national or regional agencies take their name from the US CDC. We have a shared responsibility now to reimagine the CDC to make it once again the world&#8217;s premier public health agency.\n(A version of this article was originally published in the Milbank Quarterly on August 23.)\nSource: Boston University\nThe post Opinion: The CDC needs these 4 reforms appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Biodiversity of the bee population is critical to maintaining the ecosystem function of crop pollination, which in turn is crucial to our food supply, research shows.\nThe new study shows how many more species of bees are needed to maintain crop yields when considering a longer-term time frame.\n&#8220;We found that biodiversity plays a key role in the stability of ecosystems over time,&#8221; says Natalie Lemanski, a postdoctoral researcher in the ecology, evolution and natural resources department at the Rutgers University School of Environmental and Biological Sciences (SEBS) and lead author of the study in Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution.\n&#8220;You do actually need more bee species in order to get stable pollination services over a growing season and over years.&#8221;\nThe researchers focused on various populations of bees at dozens of farms in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and California and found that many more bee species were not only needed for pollination than expected over an entire flowering season, but even more were needed over multiple years.\nThe researchers say they discovered different bee species pollinated the same types of plants at different times of the year. They also found that different bee species were the dominant pollinators on the same kind of plants in different years.\nBecause of natural fluctuations in bee populations, researchers say, all bee species present were needed to maintain a minimum threshold of pollination during lean years.\n&#8220;This research shows that abundance [of a species] matters, but bee diversity matters even more,&#8221; says Michelle Elekonich, the deputy division director of the National Science Foundation&#8217;s Directorate for Biological Sciences, which funded the study. &#8220;It&#8217;s not the same bees that are abundant at a given point in time, and variety is necessary to provide balance during a growing season—and from year to year.&#8221;\nThe study offers substantiation to a long-standing concept ecologists refer to as the &#8220;insurance hypothesis,&#8221; Lemanski says.\nThe idea is that ecosystems probably benefit when nature &#8220;diversifies the portfolio,&#8221; supporting multiple species of a category of a plant or animal, rather than relying on one dominant species.\n&#8220;We found that two to three times as many bee species were needed to meet a target level of crop pollination over the course of a growing season compared to a single date,&#8221; Lemanski says. &#8220;Similarly, twice as many species were needed to provide pollination over the course of six years compared to a single year.&#8221;\nThe researchers based their analysis on their own extensive observations of bee visits to flowers and measurements of the quantity of pollen grains deposited on individual flowers over weeks and months within a given calendar year and then over multiple years.\nThey collected the data, with permission of farmers, at 16 blueberry farms in South Jersey, at 25 watermelon farms in Central Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania, and at 36 watermelon farms in the Northern Central Valley of California.\n&#8220;The magnitude of increase in species needed over multiple years was remarkably consistent among crop systems when considered over the same interval of time,&#8221; Lemanski says.\n&#8220;In addition, the fact that the relationship between timescale and the number of species needed did not level off suggests that even longer time series, spanning multiple seasons, may further bolster the need for biodiversity to ensure reliable ecosystem service.&#8221;\nAdditional coauthors are from the University of California-Davis and Rutgers. The National Science Foundation and the US Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Agriculture and Food Research Initiative funded the work.\nSource: Rutgers University\nThe post Bee biodiversity is one way nature &#8216;diversifies its portfolio&#8217; appeared first on Futurity.",

What animal were you and what process did you go through? spikeboyI remember I wasn’t that particularly keen on it, so I think I was a sloth so I could just curl up in the corner and pretend I was on a tree and just shift up a bit every 20 minutes. We had a wonderful teacher but I’d had enough of some of the more modern dance stuff, so I used the animal thing as an exercise in having a bit of a kip. We really enjoyed the Turner and Lowry films. Did you learn to paint in both of their styles? Which famous British painter might you like to play next? Rextanka1 and DarkAnaemicII started painting a couple of years before we even started rehearsing Mr Turner. I had this excellent teacher, Tim Wright, and painted a complete reproduction of one of Turner’s masterpieces that I have on my wall and still can’t quite work out how I did it. It wasn’t until I played Lowry [in 2019’s Mrs Lowry &amp; Son] that I started painting a lot. I couldn’t stop painting between takes. I was doing slightly bad Turners, slightly bad Lowry knockoffs, then all of a sudden I started painting but couldn’t work out who it looked like, and realised it was me. I had my own exhibition last year [at London’s Pontone gallery], which was a massive surprise.

        "description": "It’s not exactly breaking news that Democrats detest Donald Trump. They loathe just about everything about him. And by “everything,” I mean … everything! But in a crazy way, they love the guy they hate. Well, maybe not actually “love”; more like “need,” because they see him as their best hope for a come-from-behind victory in November.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf you don’t believe me, maybe you’ll believe Joe Biden. In Philadelphia last week, the president couldn’t stop talking about his predecessor. He said “there is no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans.”\n\n\n\nMAGA Republicans, Biden said, “represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.” He said this fall’s midterm elections will represent a choice between “the light of truth” and&nbsp; “the shadow of lies.”\n\n\n\nThis was billed as a “Battle for the Soul of the Nation” prime-time speech — and it had all the trappings of a major league presidential address. Biden spoke in front of Independence Hall, which was bathed in crimson light, as two Marines in full dress uniform stood behind him, strategically in the camera’s shot. But for all its intended majesty, the red lighting “made the stately face of Independence Hall look like the entrance to a bordello in some red-light district,” as Bill McGurn put it in his Wall Street Journal column. (I’m glad I wasn’t the only one who thought that.)\n\n\n\nBut even the warm glow of that creepy red light couldn’t mask the reality of what was going on.&nbsp; The speech was often nasty, and more than a little partisan. Biden and the political team who came up with the game plan were trying to elevate the man they loathe. They were pretending that Joe Biden and the Democratic Party are some kind of superheroes working to save the nation from the forces of evil.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut it all comes down to this: They want to run against the man whose name isn’t even on the ballot. They want to tell the American people that Donald Trump and his most loyal supporters are nothing less than a threat to democracy — and, who knows, they might actually rev up the base and convince enough swing voters to reject Republican congressional candidates this fall.\n\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal called the speech “deeply cynical and divisive,” saying, “It contradicts Mr. Biden’s pledge, during the 2020 campaign and in his inaugural address, that he would unite the country. He repeated that claim of ‘unity’ on Thursday but by now it is a throwaway line.”\n\n\n\nFair enough. But you don’t have to think Joe Biden is a nice guy who’s doing a great job — or is even competent — to acknowledge that he’s right about some of what he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Republican Party arguably is “dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans.”\n\n\n\nTrump and his loyal “MAGA supporters” — the ones who don’t believe Biden is the legitimate president of the United States — really are a threat to “the very foundations of our republic.”\n\n\n\nTrump did try to subvert the peaceful transfer of power after he lost the 2020 presidential election. He did fire up his fans on Jan. 6, 2021— and a lot of them stormed the Capitol.\n\n\n\nDemocrats know what a lot of Republicans fear, even if they won’t say it out loud: That if Joe Biden and the blue team can make the midterm elections about Donald Trump, they’d have a good chance of at least minimizing their losses in November — and with a little luck, maybe do even better than that.\n\n\n\nWhatever else Biden’s team hoped to accomplish, they had to figure that Trump would feel the need to respond. If Biden’s speech could get under his skin and get him to fire back, then Trump would become the center of attention — and as long as the conversation is about the former president, maybe, Democrats hope, it won’t be about the current president’s failure to control inflation, crime, illegal immigration, and the Democrats’ embrace of woke, progressive ideology.\n\n\n\nAnd just as the blue team calculated, Trump took the bait.\n\n\n\nOn social media, he said that Biden “must be insane, or suffering from late-stage dementia.” Two days later, at a GOP rally in Philadelphia, he said that Biden is “an enemy of the state,” and his speech was “the most vicious, hateful, divisive speech ever delivered by an American president, vilifying 75 million citizens.”\n\n\n\nOn Labor Day, Biden was at it again, this time dusting off a very old Democratic trope to scare older folks, saying the “Trumpies” — as he called them — and the “MAGA Republicans in Congress are coming for your Social Security.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSay goodbye to the man who, right after he took office, told the American people, “We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.” And while you’re at it, say hello to a lifelong politician who will be taking aim at the foil he invented — those nasty “semi-fascists” — from now until at least November.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe won’t know for a while if the Democrats’ strategy will work, if making the midterms about Donald Trump and his most loyal supporters will be enough to convince swing voters that Republicans in general can’t be trusted with power. We’ll have the answer on Nov. 8.\n\n\n\nBut we do know this much right now: Donald Trump can’t take a shot without firing back. And that’s just what the Democrats are hoping. It’s at least one reason Joe Biden delivered that partisan speech in Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nBernard Goldberg is an Emmy and an Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University award-winning writer and journalist.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3633236-time-for-the-west-to-seize-russian-state-assets/",
        "description": "To win the war against Russia, monetary support will be as important to Ukraine as will be the delivery of weapons. But Ukraine’s government is running an approximately $5 billion monthly deficit, and its foreign currency reserves are being substantially depleted. As one commentator put it, “The current pace of losses means that Ukraine will be shortly on the verge of financial collapse if aid inflows are not sped up.” Financial aid from the United States, and to a lesser extent Europe, have thus far met the needs. However, no quick conclusion to the war is likely, as the recent announcement by the United States Department of Defense providing “mid- and long-term” capabilities to Ukraine has underscored.\n\n\n\nUkraine thus faces the very significant future financial requirements of a multi-year war which, combined with rising domestic demands on Western governments, means that establishing an alternative source of guaranteed funding has become increasingly important. To that end, Western governments should coordinate on — and then each enact — national legislation that allows them to utilize on behalf of Ukraine the approximately $300 billion currently held by those countries of Russian national reserves.\n\n\n\nRussia — and not the taxpaying publics of the United States and its allies — should bear the financial burden of its war against Ukraine.\n\n\n\nThe proposed legislation should say, in substance: “The [head of government] is authorized to seize the assets of an aggressor nation that has undertaken an armed attack in violation of the United Nations charter as requested by the nation under attack and to utilize the seized assets, including by transfer or other effective mechanisms, in support of the nation attacked.”\n\n\n\nThe proposal is intended to tie the seizure authority to the concepts behind the United Nation charter’s prohibition of the “use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.” Effectuating its implementation would be one reasonable method of collective self-defense, and, as such, authorized by the UN charter.\n\n\n\nIn the current circumstance, Ukraine would be utilizing the same type of authority as the United States has done under the Trading with the Enemy Act, and seeking support of those holding Russian assets as part of collective defense. In addition, the proposed legislation is analogous — though broader in scope and different in method — to the policies behind the international law on countermeasures which authorizes significant responses to illegal actions undertaken by an offending nation. Similarly, the international law on reparations authorizes an entity to receive compensation when harmed by the unlawful actions of a government. For example, UN General Assembly resolution 60/147 provides that a “State shall provide reparation to victims for acts or omissions which can be attributed to the State and constitute gross violations of international human rights law or serious violations of international humanitarian law,” including “any economically assessable damage.”\n\n\n\nThere have, of course, already been multiple discussions about seizing Russian assets on behalf of Ukraine. In the United States, there are differing views as to whether such seizure is already authorized under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The administration has taken the position, as articulated by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, that it does not “now” have such authority. Partly in consequence, the Congress is currently reviewing methods to seize assets owned by Russian oligarchs under sanctions.\n\n\n\nHowever, neither of these approaches — via IEEPA or against oligarchs — would meet Ukraine’s financial requirements. First, the United States does not hold anything near to the majority of Russian national assets, which rather are held by Germany, France, Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Austria. Those nations — with the exception of recent legislation in Canada — do not have statutory authority comparable to IEEPA, so any effective action against the great majority of Russian assets would require new legislative enactments. Second, while seizing the assets of sanctioned oligarchs may be morally correct and politically desirable, the amounts available are likely far too limited to resolve Ukraine’s financial requirements.\n\n\n\nTwo arguments are generally raised in opposition to the adoption of legislation authorizing the seizure of Russian assets. First, that it would undercut the stability of the international financial system for central bank assets to be seized, and second, that doing so would undercut the role of the dollar as the main international reserve currency and, in particular, encourage China to establish an alternative system. Neither bears close scrutiny.\n\n\n\nAs to the impact on the stability of the international system, it should be apparent that numerous of the already established sanctions are specifically designed to undercut Russia’s involvement in and use of that system. Even more clearly, however, the proposed legislation would only come into play if the nation whose reserves are being taken has acted in violation of the UN charter, and only at the instance of the country attacked. In such circumstances, utilizing seized assets in support of the attacked country would be an element in helping to reestablish international stability, not to undercut it. Moreover, the number of times the international financial system would be called upon to respond to aggressive inter-state warfare undertaken in violation of the UN charter hopefully would be few.\n\n\n\nAs to undercutting the role of the dollar in the international system, particularly by China, several factors suggest that the proposed seizure of Russian assets would not have such consequential effect.\n\n\n\nFirst, the proposal is not that the United States act unilaterally, but rather that it do so in coordination with the other countries holding the majority of Russian reserves. Coordinated action would mean that key countries would be in support of the action (as Canada has already demonstrated) and thus not be likely to see it as a reason to depart from use of the dollar.\n\n\n\nSecond, China is already undertaking to establish international payment mechanisms that utilize the renminbi rather than the dollar. But the renminbi is subject to Chinese currency controls and a government that is far from a free market paragon. The control maintained by the Chinese Communist Party makes the renminbi a questionable store of value — nor is it a useful medium of exchange for those who wish to trade with the West, where dollars (or euros, yen, pounds or Canadian dollars) are required. The renminbi only has an approximate 2 percent share as an international payment currency as compared to the dollar’s roughly 80 percent for inter-regional transactions, and that share is likely to rise only slowly.\n\n\n\nFinally, some have raised the issue of China choosing to terminate its holding of U.S. government debt, currently roughly $980 billion of the overall U.S. debt of roughly $30 trillion. As the figures suggest, however, China hardly is a dominant factor in the U.S. government debt market. Moreover, while theoretically it could choose to sell all or most of its dollar holdings, that would be unlikely to have lasting impact in the foreign exchange markets which process more than $6 trillion on a daily basis. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn sum: The importance of assuring that Ukraine has the capabilities required to prevail against Russia is reflected in the recently adopted NATO Strategic Concept which states that a “strong, independent Ukraine is vital for the stability of the Euro-Atlantic area.”\n\n\n\nThe United States and its allies have already undertaken a variety of collective efforts, such as through the Ukraine Defence Contact Group, to ensure Ukraine succeeds militarily. A comparable collective agreement to enact legislation authorizing seizure of Russian national assets would be a key element of “unwavering support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.”\n\n\n\nFranklin D.

        "description": "Ensemble Modern/Vimbayi Kaziboni(ECM, two CDs)Beckett, Rumi and first-world-war prisoners are referenced in Heiner Goebbels’ diverse score that incorporates chanting, jazz-rock, rhythmic dislocations and delicate solosFirst performed last year, Heiner Goebbels’s “phonographic collection from my imaginary notebook” is his first major orchestral work since the suite Surrogate Cities in 1994. He describes it as a cycle of invocations, prayers, poems and songs for a large orchestra, but, as always with Goebbels, it’s not as straightforward as that. The title comes from a line in James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake; in early 19th-century England, a “house of call” was a public space in which itinerant artisans could put their skills up for hire, and the 100-minute score creates a space in which recorded voices that Goebbels has sourced from wax cylinders, news reports and ethnographic sources can be given a political or historical context and a musical response.Among the voices and texts referenced here are Samuel Beckett and Heiner Müller, the Persian Sufi poet Rumi and the Armenian composer and folk-song collector Komitas; there are field recordings from Amazonia and Namibia and from Georgian prisoners during the first world war, and the music is equally diverse. The 15 movements of A House of Call, grouped into four parts, include moments of pounding jazz-rock (perhaps a glance back to the 1980s, when Goebbels was a member of the group Cassiber), through edgy rhythmic dislocations straight out of Stravinsky to disintegrating textures on the edges of music. But there are moments of extraordinary delicacy too, when just a solo instrument underpins a chant or a distant choir, as in the second part, Grain de la Voix (a title borrowed from Roland Barthes), built around recordings from the Caucasus.

        "description": "Photo by Adam Hagy/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Brazoban has been pretty good through 15 MLB relief appearances and his pitching profile should feel familiar to Marlins fans. I probably should have had the discipline to wait a few weeks and save this for the Huascar Brazoban installment of our 2022 Marlins Season Review series. But the comp came to mind while watching Brazoban’s appearance on Wednesday, and I can’t resist expounding on it.\nA non-roster invitee to Marlins spring training as a minor league free agent signing, Brazoban took several months to distinguish himself. The 32-year-old didn’t threaten to make the club’s Opening Day roster. Pitching at the Triple-A level for the first time in his career, the Dominican right-hander owned a discouraging 5.32 ERA/5.22 FIP through the end of May.\nA switch flipped in the middle of his campaign. Brazoban’s swinging strike and groundball rates soared for the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp as he found his niche in a multi-inning role. A deluge of injuries to Marlins pitchers in July allowed him to get his foot in the door.\nThe Marlins have barely anything invested in Brazoban, so he would not still be here six-plus weeks later unless he was performing. One of Miami’s few bright spots since the All-Star break, Brazoban has ridden whiffs and soft contact to good results.\n\n\nHuascar Brazoban punching out Cody Bellinger in an important situation, just like everybody predicted entering this season pic.twitter.com/12g3stPJ7t— Fish Stripes (@fishstripes) August 26, 2022\n\n\n\n  \n        \n      Baseball-Reference\n  \n\nI sort of glossed over the fact that this is his age-32 season. He’s the second-oldest Marlin ever to make his MLB debut behind only Joe Strong. Feels like it’s been a while since Kyle Barraclough pitched here, right? And yet, Barraclough is younger than Brazoban!\nAnyway, I was compelled to write about this unconventional rookie reliever because the Brazoban viewing experience is very Barraclough-esque. Despite poor control, he’s been good at run prevention thanks to nasty secondary pitches that play off his high-90s fastball velocity, outperforming ERA estimators just like Barraclough did throughout most of his Marlins tenure.\nThe statistical resemblance is uncanny:\n\nBrazoban as a Marlin: 29.5 K%, 14.7 BB%, 28.8 HardHit%, 3.8 Barrel% in 21.2 IP\nBarraclough as a Marlin: 29.8 K%, 14.3 BB%, 29.8 HardHit%, 3.5 Barrel% in 218.2 IP\n\nThe Dodgers rocked Brazoban for three earned runs in a mop-up outing last month; in all his other outings combined, he has allowed four total earned runs.\nAlthough Brazoban has his limitations, he’s shown the potential to get timely strikeouts. He possesses an uncommonly deep pitch mix by bullpen standards wich includes plenty of four-seamers, changeups, cutters and occasional sinkers. Opponents are taking uncomfortable swings against him.\nThe projected 2023 Marlins bullpen is unsettled, especially now that Cody Poteet and Anthony Bender have had Tommy John surgery and Cole Sulser is struggling to rediscover his pre-injury form. Kyle Barraclough 2.0 could prove useful.\nI don’t think the Marlins should be in any rush to move Brazoban, but this offseason presents a particularly challenging 40-man roster crunch for them. Four more solid weeks of production to wrap up 2022 would be huge for his job security.",

        "link": "https://learninginnovation.duke.edu/blog/2022/09/flanagans/",
        "description": "By Zhixian Zhang*\n\n\n\nAs one of the student partners of the Center for Teaching and Learning, Duke Kunshan University, I interviewed Owen Flanagan, Ph.D., Professor of Philosophy at Duke, in May 2022 about his teaching philosophy. When I went to Duke as an exchange student this spring, I was deeply inspired by his World Philosophy course. This course not only offers a gateway for students to critically engage with diverse philosophical traditions but also creates an inclusive, caring community where students could blossom and explore actively. Therefore, I am eager to share Prof. Flanagan’s teaching story from a student perspective. \n\n\n\nCreate an Inclusive Classroom&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen reading the assigned book “Republic” during class (Plato, 2013), I was impressed by the scene: a group of students sitting under a big tree, asking many questions spontaneously, and their teacher Socrates answering their questions. This is not like teaching in a traditional setting; rather, it is a thought-provoking conversation among different souls. I was fortunate to experience a similar scene in Prof. Flanagan&#8217;s class with such an inclusive and engaging atmosphere. No matter how ignorant students&#8217; questions appeared to be, Prof. Flanagan always managed to answer them patiently while keeping the conversation relevant. I wondered how he struck a balance between delivering meaningful lectures and maintaining adequate interactions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo respond, Prof. Flanagan first pointed out that the foremost task in teaching is to stick to the syllabus and cover all the important content. That is to say, do not let a good conversation slow down the schedule. Apart from that, he regarded it essential to clarify questions for students. &#8220;Never in my life I&#8217;ve heard a dumb question.&#8221; He claimed, &#8220;Philosophy can be confusing, and things you take for granted can be difficult for others to understand.&#8221; Prof. Flanagan usually pauses at the end of a speech so that students will have more time to ponder the topic and raise questions. But it also brought out a problem: two students in our class were always in a competition of throwing quick questions and trying to be the smartest. To foster a culture of intellectual interaction where everyone has an opportunity to join, Prof. Flanagan sometimes chose to ignore them when he saw the two hands in the air. Still, he gave them chances to talk most of the time and welcomed further discussions with them after class.  \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, to keep the whole class engaged, he observes students&#8217; faces, and he asks students questions directly if they seem to be deep in thought. If a student does not give a perfect answer, he won&#8217;t see it as a mistake and will simply complement more. A signal of invitation was the best encouragement for me to overcome shyness and speak up; as a result, it deepened my understanding of the class content. Researchers (Cashin, 2011) also support and explain the value of an open-ended discussion, which urges students to process information rather than simply receive it, as it gets students to practice thinking about the course material actively. Moreover, Prof. Flanagan sometimes asks students questions based on their interests and specialized fields, which is also a great way to stimulate students to think thoroughly as well as make them feel valued and supported.  \n\n\n\nFoster Diversity in Course Design&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn addition to inclusiveness, Prof. Flanagan also paid great attention to ensuring diversity in the course. While treating all individuals fairly and respectfully, he further recognized students’ diversity in aspects of knowledge, cultural background, and so on. To accommodate it, he included the formation and decolonization of neglected philosophies like African philosophy in the syllabus. “The problem is, the world is too diverse to give all the traditions worth attending to attention.” He stated with regret. For instance, since lots of African philosophies are in oral form instead of in written texts, it is hard to deliver unified, clear representations of them. Still, he believed there is a lot of insight in every single world philosophy tradition, and they deserved to be discovered and learned.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy adopting diversifying course materials, Prof. Flanagan is able to bring more equal classroom dynamics and show perspectives from a wider range of backgrounds (n.d.). For instance, he allowed students to write and present any topic they liked for the final paper. In addition to giving students chances to pursue their passion, it also heartened them to explore overlooked branches and share those precious, unique cultures with others. For instance, I got to investigate Zhuangzi’s attitudes toward death for the final project, and I gained applause and discussions with classmates after my presentation in class. Therefore, I believe that diversity cultivates an open mind in students.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEncourage Students’ Autonomy&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne thing about Prof. Flanagan&#8217;s syllabus has always intrigued me, which is that there is no length requirement or specific prompts for weekly posts on reading materials. In other words, as long as students hand in the homework on time, even if they only write one paragraph, they could get a full score on this section. Initially, I thought it only encouraged students to goof off, yet it had the opposite effect as everyone took the weekly posts seriously and submitted them in time. Prof. Flanagan explained his motives for designing homework in this way.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThough some teachers tend to shove information into students, Prof. Flanagan thought that students should learn actively, and the best way to keep them active is to make them act as if they were chatting with the author of the reading material in the same room. Through supporting, refuting, and offering reasons for their argument, students&#8217; minds can be stimulated and promote their participation in the class. Furthermore, feedback provided by Prof. Flanagan and our teaching assistant on the weekly post can help us revise and modify mistakes. Setting a deadline with a penalty is to make sure that students spend time on the post and prepare for the class, while no word or content limit means that students can act according to their self-interests. In this case, students tend to have more intrinsic motivation and dare to deliver genuine, thought-provoking ideas. Prof. Flanagan shared that students might gather the courage to criticize authorities such as Confucius and Plato in such a freeform assignment. Sometimes, he asked if students were willing to share their posts with others before class since they were provocative and inspiring, but he also respected them if they wanted to keep their ideas to themselves. \n\n\n\nIndependent learning by students also works as a feedback loop to improve teaching. While students act with autonomy and present their ideas frankly, Prof. Flanagan also adjusted his teaching moves accordingly. He found it very helpful to read students&#8217; comments before class to learn about the advantages and deficiencies in their thinking. If he noticed that students were siding the same view, he would provide an alternative. When students were confused about one concept, he offered a more detailed clarification in class. Research also indicated that the teaching strategy of high autonomy attends to students’ different learning needs and requires students to take responsibility for their workflow, enabling them to demonstrate their learning in various ways (n.d.).  \n\n\n\nTakeaways \n\n\n\nProf. Flanagan traveled to China and taught at DKU in 2018, so he is familiar with DKU&#8217;s liberal arts and global educational system. Hence, he emphasizes that inclusive and discussion-based teaching and learning are even more critical at DKU. He also suggests not assigning too many (reading) materials making courses focused and manageable, and giving students more time to think and ask questions.\n\n\n\nAlthough there is a saying from Confucius “I am a transmitter, not an innovator,” Prof. Flanagan believes that teaching requires a teacher to take on both roles. Even being a teacher, keeping attaining knowledge and being curious are still indispensable for imparting wisdom to pupils. The old texts may come alive and be connected with new situations in real life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n\nCashin, W. E. (2011). Effective classroom discussions.

The film-makers reveal why working with a neurodivergent cast was so rewarding‘I’ve always dreamed of being in a boyband,” says director Eddie Sternberg, laughing – then quickly adding for clarity: “I’m kidding!” He’s talking about his debut feature, I Used to Be Famous. It’s the story of a washed-up former pop star played by Deadpool actor Ed Skrein, who gets his musical mojo back by jamming with a talented autistic drummer (played by newcomer Leo Long).Actually, says Sternberg, he got the idea for the film 10 years ago when pop stars started doing comeback tours. “Blue, 5ive, Eternal – all these bands from when I was a kid.” Grabbing at a final 15 minutes of fame, they were only in their late 20s or early 30s. “I found that tragic, the idea of people having their peak in their teens or 20s, then trying to fill that void.

        "description": "The big phones have won. | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n    \n\n  Well, that’s it then — after just two iterations, Apple seems to be done with the iPhone Mini. Sure, it’ll still sell you a new one; last year’s 128GB iPhone 13 Mini is currently available for $599, but the new iPhone 14 lineup doesn’t include any models with the smaller 5.4-inch screen that some people have come to love. \nI may be disappointed, but I’m not surprised. Rumors of the Mini’s death have been swirling almost since it debuted in 2020. In early 2021, reports started to surface that Apple had vastly overestimated demand for the phone and had to slash production of it and that it only accounted for single-digit percentages of all iPhone sales. \nThe Mini wasn’t perfect, and it was niche — a perfect formula for a cult classic\nP...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "Names provide memory cues, and sales rely on this association whether the product is the same as what you remember it to be or not. This discrepancy is particularly problematic when it comes to marijuana, also known as weed, pot, dope, reefer or more formally, cannabis. \n\n\n\nThe problem is that the THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) content in marijuana products is not the same as it was decades ago. In fact, it has routinely risen to&nbsp;well over 50 percent&nbsp;in edibles, wax, vapes or dabs (butane hash oil). So even if your memory flashes you back to something you first learned about or tried in high school, in fact, what you encounter now is not the same.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA recent review of 20 studies in the medical journal Lancet reveals that high potency THC products lead to a much higher rate of addiction (regular or daily use), cannabis use disorder, which in turn is associated with a much higher rate of cannabis-induced psychosis. This condition, characterized by hallucinations and delusions, may last for one to two days but if the person happens to have an underlying psychiatric disorder (such as schizophrenia), which might not be known at the time, It can last months or even longer. \n\n\n\nThe problem with the current push toward legalization is that it doesn’t include efforts to limit the percentage of THC in the product. I think&nbsp;Italy&nbsp;has it right. Cannabis is not strictly legal there, but it is decriminalized, and shops there can and do sell cannabis products with up to 0.5 percent THC, a much safer percentage. These shops are busy, and one could argue that they are diverting users away from the higher potency, more dangerous products. This is a strategy that should be considered here.\n\n\n\nHere in the U.S., recreational cannabis is now legal in 19 states, with medical marijuana legal in 37 states. Many more states are on the way, and Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) have proposed legislation for decriminalizing it across all 50 states and removing it from the federal list of controlled substances, known as the “Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act.”\n\n\n\nI understand the argument that people are going to get and use marijuana whether it's legal or not, but if legalization isn’t accompanied by limiting THC content, little will be accomplished from a public health perspective.\n\n\n\nAubree Adams, director of the nonprofit, Every Brain Matters, said to me on Fox News, “Cannabis-induced psychosis is real and it's destroying thousands of families across America. Once the brain is broken, once it's addicted, it's really hard to get it back.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse said to me on Fox News that we are seeing more and more young men with these episodes, as people are exposed to higher and higher content products that are becoming more widely available. “Exposure early on to THC,” she said, “modifies the brain in ways that make it more susceptible later on to other drugs.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nToday’s marijuana is not only more powerful, but it is also sometimes laced with hallucinogens, PCP, embalming fluid and even fentanyl. Whatever we do to regulate it, we must recognize that it is not what it once was.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMarc Siegel, M.D., is a professor of medicine and medical director of Doctor Radio at NYU Langone Health. He is a Fox News medical correspondent and author of the new book, “COVID; the Politics of Fear and the Power of Science.”",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional gas-powered vehicles are a major contributor to climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In light of this, many manufacturers are looking to transition to cleaner alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne option that could transform the future of transportation is electric flying taxis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited Airlines has its sights set on the future of transportation. \n\n\n\nYesterday, it announced a $15 million investment in Eve Air Mobility, a company that specializes in electric flying taxis, in an effort to revolutionize commutes and aid the transportation sector’s transition to clean energy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe investment comes alongside a conditional purchase agreement for up to 400 electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (eVTOLs), with first deliveries expected as early as 2026.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEve’s taxis have a range of 40 to 60 miles and the vehicles can cut noise levels by 90 percent compared with traditional aircraft.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs part of the agreement the two companies plan to work on future projects together including the development of an urban air mobility (UAM) ecosystem. Eve is planning on simulating its UAM system in Chicago next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, United submitted a $10 million down payment on 100 eVTOLS from Archer Aviation, a California-based company also pioneering private air taxis. This initial investment is part of a $1 billion partnership between the two companies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe investments are part of United’s strategy to pave the way for aviation sustainability and innovation, said Michael Leskinen, President of United Airlines Ventures (UAV), the company’s corporate venture fund, in a press release.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Our agreement with Eve highlights our confidence in the urban air mobility market and serves as another important benchmark toward our goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – without using traditional offsets,” Leskinen added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Together, we believe our suite of clean energy technologies will revolutionize air travel as we know it and serve as the catalyst for the aviation industry to move toward a sustainable future.\"\n\n\n\nCalling the opportunity to work with United Airlines “unparalleled” Andre Stein, co-CEO of Eve, said he looks forward to the partnership.\n\n\n\n“I am confident that our UAM agnostic solutions, coupled with the global know-how we have been developing at Eve and Embraer's [an aircraft manufacturer] heritage, are the best fit for this initiative, giving United's customers a quick, economical and sustainable way to get to its hub airports and commute in dense urban environments,” Stein said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe partnership also grants United access to Embraer’s service centers and parts warehouses, along with field service technicians.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor some, private air taxis can seem like a science fiction novel trope. But the industry has been plugging away at commercialization for years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2021, American Airlines said it would invest $25 million with Vertical Aerospace, while Boeing has been working alongside Wisk, another electric air taxi company.\n\n\n\nHowever, as of August 2022, no company has been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration to begin commercial flights and many questions remain when it comes to pilot requirements and training. In addition, how these new systems will be integrated into existing aircraft systems poses a challenge.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn Eve’s part, the company says it is developing a “new air traffic management solution” aimed at safely scaling the UAM industry. “This software is intended to perform at the same safety level as Embraer's existing air traffic management software and expected to be a strategic asset to helping the entire industry grow,” the company’s press release reads.",

        "description": "More than 30 leading agricultural groups on Thursday urged lawmakers to avert a rail strike that would halt the transport of food and potentially cripple the U.S. economy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAround 115,000 rail workers could strike as soon as Sept. 16 if they cannot reach a contract agreement with railroads. Many workers are eager to walk out after their dissatisfaction with contract recommendations offered by a White House-appointed panel aimed at ending years of contentious negotiations.\n\n\n\nIn a letter to the top lawmakers on transportation committees, agricultural groups warned that farmers rely on freight rail to transport their goods and that any kind of stoppage would likely lead to the loss of food supplies, driving up prices and exacerbating the risk of famine around the globe.\n\n\n\n“A complete stoppage of the rail system would lead to shutdowns or slowdowns of rail-dependent facilities resulting in devastating consequences to our national and global food security,” the groups, including the American Farm Bureau Federation and National Grain and Feed Association, told lawmakers.\n\n\n\n“A freight rail stoppage would drastically make inflation worse, especially for those who can least afford it,” they added.\n\n\n\nCongress has the power to block or delay railroad strikes. In the event of a lockout, lawmakers could vote to enact the White House-appointed panel’s recommendations, something railroads are pushing for, or appoint arbitrators to fast-track a new deal, among a range of other options.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJust five of the 13 unions representing rail workers have reached tentative agreements with railroads to implement the panel recommendations, which call for 24 percent raises but don’t address workers’ concerns about grueling hours and a lack of time off.\n\n\n\nSome workers and union leaders see a strike as their only source of leverage, and they’ve accused railroads of banking on Congress to take it away. Democratic leaders are expected to block a strike rather than risk economic upheaval ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n\n\n“After the pandemic and supply chain disruptions of the past two years, now is not the time for more uncertainty and disruption,” a White House official told The Hill this week. “Now is the time for the parties to resolve their differences, before the nation’s economy begins responding to even the prospect of a nationwide rail stoppage.”",

        "description": "Photo by Harry How/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Seeing how the 2022 Dodgers stack up to history The Dodgers continue to pile on win after win and have given themselves a shot to break not only franchise records, but Major League Baseball records. \nWednesday afternoon’s win gave the Dodgers a 94-42 (.691) record through 136 games. Let’s see how that stacks up with some of the teams they are chasing.\nRELATED\nDodgers magic number to clinch the NL West\nMost MLB wins in a season\nAs mentioned in yesterday’s post, the number the Dodgers are chasing here is 116. In 1906, the Cubs went 116-36, good for the most wins in an MLB season as well as the highest winning percentage in a season (.763). Almost an entire century later, the 2001 Seattle Mariners tied the Cubs’ record of 116 wins.\nThrough Game 136, the 1906 Cubs were 104-32, whereas the 2001 Mariners found themselves with a record of 97-39. \nThe Dodgers currently sit at 94-42, a full ten games behind the Cubs and just three games behind the Mariners. In order to catch either of these teams and tie the record mark of 116 wins, the Dodgers will need to finish the season on a 22-4 run, not an easy task.\nAccording to Fangraphs, the Dodgers are currently on pace to win 109 games, but it’s important to remember that projections are just projections.  Let’s not forget that the Dodgers just came off of a month of August in which the team went 22-6. Anything is possible.  \nIf the Dodgers want to be the National League team with more than 109 wins since the 1909 Pirates, they need to finish at least 15-11. They are currently on pace to do so. \nBest Dodgers record ever\nPerhaps the Dodgers’ best shot at breaking a record this season has nothing to do with the rest of baseball, and everything to do with the Dodger franchise. In 2019 and 2021, the Dodgers finished the year with 106 wins, tied for the highest mark in franchise history. \nThe only way the Dodgers don’t at least tie this mark is if they play under .500 baseball the rest of the way. To finish 106-56 and tie the franchise record, the Dodgers need to go 12-14 in September. \nTo beat the record and set a franchise wins record, all the boys in blue need to do is play .500 baseball. A 13-13 finish amongst the final 26 games of the year would give the Dodgers a 107-55 record.",

        "description": "Diamondbacks catcher/outfielder Daulton Varsho has impressed so much in the outfield this season that his days behind the plate could be drawing to a close, writes Nick Piecoro of the Arizona Republic. Varsho tells Piecoro that he&#8217;s even surprised himself with how well he&#8217;s taken to the outfield.\nA former top-100 prospect, the 26-year-old former top prospect has drawn immaculate grades for his outfield defense in 2022, tallying 14 Defensive Runs Saved and, according to Statcast, 13 Outs Above Average and 12 Runs Above Average. Those are cumulative totals, so it&#8217;s worth noting that Varsho has also spent 175 innings behind the plate this year; had he been a full-time outfielder, those defensive marks would&#8217;ve likely been even more eye-catching.\nVarsho, who says it&#8217;s a personal goal of his to win a Gold Glove, added that he&#8217;s not content with his current level of outfield play, citing a few near-catches he missed (on what would&#8217;ve been highlight-reel efforts). Varsho labeled himself a perfectionist and spoke of small, incremental gains he could still make in his defensive game &#8212; &#8220;&#8230;[I]f I can add an extra inch by not having to look at the wall and understanding what I can do to get better&#8230;&#8221; &#8212; as part of his hopeful evolution.\nOf course, Varsho is far more than just a strong glove in the outfield. He&#8217;s built on a solid showing at the plate last summer and turned in a .243/.311/.457 batting line this season, swatting 23 home runs, 20 doubles and three triples while chipping in eight stolen bases (albeit in 14 attempts). It&#8217;s a solid, well-round skill set that could leave him as a fixture in center or right field, depending on how the remainder of the Diamondbacks&#8217; young outfield pans out.\nCorbin Carroll, regarded as one of the sport&#8217;s top prospects &#8212; if not the top prospect &#8212; prior to his promotion earlier this month, gives Arizona a potential high-impact talent to pair with Varsho in the long term. He&#8217;s followed up a combined .307/.425/.611 batting line in the minors this year with a .281/.324/.469 showing through his first eight big league games and now has 24 home runs and 31 steals between the minors and big leagues combined.\nAdd in the likes of Alek Thomas, himself a top-100 prospect prior to this season&#8217;s debut, and 25-year-old Jake McCarthy, who has surpassed all expectations with a strong debut campaign of his own, and the outfield group in Phoenix looks particularly promising. The 22-year-old Thomas has cooled after a solid start and is batting .249/.295/.373 on the season but has turned in plus defensive marks in center. McCarthy, meanwhile, is batting .288/.348/.455 with seven homers, 14 doubles, two triples and a 15-for-16 showing in stolen bases.\nIt&#8217;s a talented, albeit entirely left-handed, group of outfielders around which to build. That there are four players for three spots might make it tempting to continue deploying Varsho behind the dish at times, but his elite play in the outfield would be lost in that scenario. Manager Torey Lovullo told Piecoro that there are no plans for Varsho to start behind the plate for the remainder of the season, further pointing to a long-term move away from the position.\nIt&#8217;s a bit early to label the quartet of lefty-hitting outfielders a true &#8220;surplus.&#8221; Thomas&#8217; offense has been below average, and it&#8217;s fair to wonder whether McCarthy can sustain production that&#8217;s been bolstered by a .347 average on balls in play &#8212; particularly when he&#8217;s making hard contact at a below-average clip. Statcast pegs his &#8220;expected&#8221; batting average and slugging percentage at .259 and .367 &#8212; both well shy of his current marks. Carroll is a top-five prospect in baseball, but he also just turned 22 in late August, so it&#8217;s not a given that he&#8217;ll immediately break out into stardom.\nStill, Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic wonders about the possibility of the Diamondbacks utilizing this group of outfielders to bolster the rotation over the winter. There are plenty of teams with outfield needs who&#8217;d love to acquire a controllable long-term player to step right onto the 2023 roster.  Varsho is controlled through 2026, McCarthy through 2027 and both Thomas and Carroll through at least 2028. Speculating a bit, the Marlins are known to still be looking for their center fielder of the future and have plenty of pitching to dangle in talks with the D-backs. Arizona and Miami previously lined up on a Zac Gallen-for-Jazz Chisholm swap that has benefited both clubs, though the Marlins&#8217; front office has turned over a good bit since that time.\nTrading from that quartet of outfielders would thin out the Diamondbacks&#8217; outfield depth, quite likely in a significant way, but they do have some other options on the 40-man roster, including the right-handed-hitting Stone Garrett, who&#8217;s out to a blistering MLB debut himself after a nice showing in Triple-A. The free-agent market would also present several affordable, short-term options to plug into the outfield mix, and finding a useful complementary outfielder on the open market is quite a bit easier than finding the type of potentially impact arm that a trade of someone like Thomas could bring.\nHowever general manager Mike Hazen and his staff choose to proceed this winter, the play of the team&#8217;s young outfielders will give them plenty of options. And with a lot clicking elsewhere on the roster &#8212; Arizona is 26-19 since the All-Star break, a .578 winning percentage &#8212; the D-backs could be a shrewd offseason move or two away from reasserting themselves in the National League West more quickly than most would anticipate.",

        "description": "Atlantic Editions, a first-of-its-kind book imprint launched as a partnership between The Atlantic and the independent publisher Zando, announced today three upcoming titles set to publish in April 2023 from Atlantic writers: On Grief, by Jennifer Senior; On Work, by Derek Thompson; and On Nobody Famous, by Kaitlyn Tiffany and Lizzie Plaugic. All six current Atlantic Editions titles are available for preorder now.On Grief will be Senior’s Pulitzer Prize–winning story, originally published as “Twenty Years Gone” in The Atlantic’s September 2021 issue, about one family’s search for meaning after the loss of their son on September 11, 2001. The Pulitzer committee called Senior’s piece an “unflinching portrait of a family’s reckoning with loss in the 20 years since 9/11, masterfully braiding the author’s personal connection to the story with sensitive reporting that reveals the long reach of grief.”Tiffany and Plaugic’s On Nobody Famous is a literary collection drawn from work the pair began independently, then developed into an Atlantic newsletter. The book invites readers to follow the duo as they explore small parties, weird dinners, and aimless evenings in New York City in their characteristic irreverent and hilarious prose.Thompson’s On Work explores the future of work, technology, and culture at an inflection point in the history of labor as we face the rise of automation and AI, the “Great Resignation,” and a labor-movement resurgence. Thompson provides influential coverage of these subjects through his Work in Progress newsletter, and a special reporting series called “Progress.”“So many readers come to The Atlantic because they love Jennifer, Kaitlyn, Lizzie, and Derek,” said Adrienne LaFrance, executive editor of The Atlantic. “I can’t wait for them—and for all of us—to experience their extraordinary writing, original ideas, wit, and wisdom in book form.”The books under the Atlantic Editions imprint feature long-form journalism by Atlantic writers, each devoted to a single topic, and incorporate contemporary articles and classic storytelling from the magazine’s rich archive. The imprint’s first books––announced in May 2022 and publishing January 10, 2023––are On Misdirection, by Megan Garber; On Womanhood, by Sophie Gilbert (a finalist for the 2022 Pulitzer Prize in Criticism); and On BTS, by Lenika Cruz. They will offer their definitive writing on, respectively, our fractured attention, feminism, and the cultural influence of the world’s biggest band.\r\n\r\nThrough their partnership, Zando and The Atlantic seek to bring these stories to a wider audience by offering the books at an affordable cost and making them accessible as individual, definitive works.",

First, there is much detail to come. Also, it is an undeniable paradox that the first move of a prime minister surrounded by former Taxpayers’ Alliance staff is a £150bn state effort to fix commercial prices.Much like Boris Johnson would never have wanted to be the prime minister to curtail people’s liberties more severely than anyone since wartime, it is fair to say Truss would rather not have begun her tenure in No 10 with what is known as the energy price guarantee.

        "description": "There&#8217;s no denying the fact that ChromeOS 105 is an iterative update.  The headline feature added this time around is a new gaming overlay interface for Android games that is now officially in alpha status.  While a solid feature that will be useful and better in time, it is limited to a handful of games for now and is currently only a fun look at a way the ChromeOS team is tackling the continued lack of support from game developers for Chromebooks.\n\n\n\nMore exciting this time around is the fact that ChromeOS 105 is out and the bug fixes/security updates contained under the hood will likely make things safer, smoother and more secure than they were in ChromeOS 104.  The update technically became available last week on September 2nd, but no one saw the update until today.  Unlike most times, there&#8217;s not really a laundry list of new changes and features.  It&#8217;s just an clean-up sort of update this time around.\n\n\n\nWith Google opting for the new 4-week update schedule since ChromeOS 97, we&#8217;re simply going to have less feature-rich ChromeOS updates like this one pretty often moving forward.  I and likely many others are completely OK with that, too.  I&#8217;d much rather see the updates continue to regularly roll in with their bug fixes and security patches while the ChromeOS team focuses in on the bigger features to unveil when they are really, truly ready.\n\n\n\nFor now, it&#8217;s just nice to know that ChromeOS 105 is rolling out and we can go ahead and start looking forward to ChromeOS 106 slated to arrive later in September on the 29th.  For the moment, we&#8217;re not tracking any specific features for version 106, but that will likely change over the course of this month.  As always, we&#8217;ll keep digging and we&#8217;ll keep you all alerted when we find more upcoming things on the way.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Enlarge / The Carbon's design is striking, lacking a full seat tube. (credit: John Timmer)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I was trying to figure out how to position the Urtopia Carbon e-bike so it could get enough signal to join my Wi-Fi network and download new firmware, I took a moment to ponder what would have happened if Apple had taken a tiny fraction of the money it has reportedly spent on its rumored electric car project and diverted it into making an e-bike instead. What would years of experience with mobile computing, hardware/software integration, maps and voice commands, and more mean for a bike?\nUrtopia is clearly trying to make software one of the Carbon's differentiating features, but the company is still in the learning stages. There are some interesting ideas in the software, and it's hosted on a pretty solid e-bike platform. But the package needs a bit more refinement and integration.\nThe bike\nThe Carbon's design is something that only became possible with the advent of carbon fiber frames, and it's certainly a striking bike. In theory, the joints between the different sections of the tube could be engineered to provide enough flex to absorb some shocks. But the Carbon is probably the stiffest e-bike I've ever tested. (I also may have made the ride a bit bumpier by inflating the tires too much, since I was unable to find any indication of what the preferred pressure was.)Read 26 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "The Jeep Recon.                      [credit:\n                        Stellantis                        ]\n                  \n        \n      \n      \n  \nAlthough Stellantis has been doing great business with electric vehicles across the pond—the company sold more BEVs than Tesla in Europe during the first half of 2022—it has only a small handful of plug-in hybrids for sale in the US. That is about to change, as the automaker has revealed plans for electrifying its top-selling Jeep brand.\nJeep will bring four all-electric SUVs to the North American and European market by 2025. First up will be the Wagoneer S and Jeep Recon. The Recon is an all-new model patterned on Jeep's top-selling Wrangler, with removable doors and windows and a \"one-touch powertop.\" The Wagoneer S may get a different name by the time it hits the market, but Jeep is targeting a 400 km/250 mi range once it arrives. Both models will go into production in 2024, with the other two yet-to-be-revealed models following in 2025. Europeans will be able to buy the BEV Jeep Avenger, a subcompact SUV that's smaller than the Renegade, early next year.\nIt's not just Jeep getting BEVs, either. Chrysler, which currently offers only the Pacifica minivan (available as a PHEV) and 300 sedan, has a BEV concept car dubbed the Airflow. That model will likely be the basis for the first Chrysler BEV, which is slated to hit the market by 2025. Chrysler plans to be all-electric by 2028. Stellantis also has an electric pickup truck on the way; the company plans to unveil the Ram Revolution—its answer to the Ford F-150 Lightning—in November. Dodge is getting some electric love, too—Stellantis showed off a concept Dodge Charger Daytona SRT last month but has yet to reveal production plans for the all-electric muscle car.Read 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

The latter, says his former technical assistant Jason Stern, was “stacked almost floor to ceiling” with unlabelled cardboard boxes. “I had no idea what was in them. I never asked Lou.”When Reed died in 2013, the question of what to do with it all loomed large for his wife, the artist, musician and film director Laurie Anderson. No, she sighs, Reed left no instructions regarding his archive. “Wouldn’t that be great! No, nothing. Zero. We didn’t really talk about it,” she says. She even balks at the notion of calling it an archive. “I wouldn’t say that because he kept things, he was aware of their value. He didn’t think about his stuff that way. He wasn’t curating at all. He really wasn’t that interested in his past. He just left it there. This stuff was not important to him.” Continue reading...",

And are they really directed at her?The most famous song about Queen Elizabeth II is called God Save the Queen, and so is the second most famous. The Sex Pistols’ decision to record and release their anti-monarchist screed in time for the silver jubilee was the most brilliant provocation in a career consisting of almost nothing but brilliant provocations. The band had been playing the song for a few months under its original title, No Future, but manager Malcolm McLaren said the phrase sounded “like an ad for a bank”. Much better, he thought, to hijack the national anthem, turn it upside down and hitch a ride on the jubilee. What a coup.Another thing the Sex Pistols’ hit shares with the national anthem is that it is not about Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor but a symbol of the British state. For John Lydon, the Queen is not just synonymous with “the fascist regime”, she’s “not a human being” at all. The song soon spirals away from the ruler towards the resentfully ruled, “the flowers in the dustbin”. Britain was so fraught in 1977 – politically, socially, economically – that to many young people, the patriotic jubilee festivities were a bitter farce of nostalgia and denial, like bunting on a bomb site. As Jon Savage writes in England’s Dreaming: “Here was the ultimate statement of pop’s everlasting present, just at the moment when the masses were celebrating the past.”For although the pound may tumble, although panic fills the airAlthough government may crumble, and the cupboards nearly bareThough the stairs begin to rattle, and the rats begin to stareShe enfolds in mystic unity her subjects everywhereAnd we know we’re safe from harm while nanny’s there Continue reading...",

        "description": "Kamil Krzaczynski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Cubs were battered by the Reds 7-1 This was a dreadful loss, the kind of game that can happen when you are just playing out the string. Yesterday, it was the Reds (other than Kyle Farmer) who looked disinterested. Today it was the Cubs. To be fair, the Cubs did have 12 hits, but somehow only managed to plate a single run. There were three double play balls, certainly that contributed. It feels like there have been a lot of double plays recently. Aside from Tuesday’s effort, Cubs bats have been struggling a bit over the last week. Hitting into double plays is just one aspect of that. \nOn the other side of the ledger, only Sean Newcomb was totally clean. Michael Rucker retired five of the six batters he faced and didn’t allow any runs. The other three pitchers who worked in this game faced a total of 29 hitters and allowed seven runs. Javier Assad got knocked around for the first time. It’ll be up to him to make some adjustments. He did at least record six strikeouts. \nThere’s not a lot to say about a game like this. On a night like this, you wonder how this team ever wins games. But, I’m confident the team will bounce back and win the series. \nLet’s get right to three positives. \n1) The top spot has to go to Yan Gomes who was a perfect four hits in four at bats. I was surprised to find that not only is this the third four-hit game of his career, but that he had a five hit game previously as well (in nine innings no less!). \n2) P.J. Higgins had a pair of hits and the lone run driven in. \n3) I give the last nod to Sean Newcomb completing a perfect inning (under any circumstance at this point). \nAnd now, we take a look at the Heroes and Goats from Wednesday’s loss. \nGame 136, September 7: Reds 7 at Cubs 1 (57-79)\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs\n  \nReminder: Heroes and Goats are determined by WPA scores and are in no way subjective.\nTHREE HEROES:\n\n\nSuperhero: P.J. Higgins (.126). 2-4, RBI, K\n\nHero: Yan Gomes (.088). 4-4\n\nSidekick: Franmil Reyes (.028). 2-4, 2K\n\nTHREE GOATS:\n\n\nBilly Goat: Erich Uelmen (-.239). 0IP (3 batters), 2H, BB, 2R\n\nGoat: Nick Madrigal (-.180). 0-5, K, DP\n\nKid: Christopher Morel (-.084). 1-4, 2B, 2K\n\nWPA Play of the Game: With one out and the bases loaded in the sixth inning, the game was  only 2-1 when Spencer Steer stepped to the plate. He singled, scoring a run and then the ball was misplayed and a second run scored and runners ended on second and third. (.145)\n*Cubs Play of the Game: It was scoreless in the second inning when P.J. Higgins stepped to the plate with runners on first and second with no outs. He delivered an RBI single. (.123)\n\nRizzo Award Cumulative Standings: (Top 5/Bottom 5)\nThe award is named for Anthony Rizzo, who finished first in this category three of the first four years it was in existence and four times overall. He also recorded the highest season total ever at +65.5. The point scale is three points for a Superhero down to negative three points for a Billy Goat.\n\nDavid Robertson +22.5\nScott Effross +17\nNico Hoerner +16.5\nChristopher Morel +14\nPatrick Wisdom +13.5\nDaniel Norris/Frank Schwindel/Rowan Wick -9.5\nYan Gomes -13\nRafael Ortega -13.5\nJason Heyward -15.5\n\nUp Next: The third and final game of this series Thursday afternoon. Adrian Sampson (1-5, 3.95) will start for the Cubs. The Reds go with Luis Cessa (3-2, 5.18) goes for the Reds. \nWriter’s note: I’m undergoing a medical procedure on Monday, September 12. I do not know at this point what my writing capabilities will be during the Mets series. When I can, I’ll resume at least stats-only recaps. And when I can, I’ll return to regular recaps. I’ll update Al regarding status as things progress and I recover.",

Members of the LGBTQ community use the rainbow flag in pride-related events.\n\nKrishna presented the posters — one written in Arabic, the others with rainbows — near the start of Monday night’s meeting.\n\nAh, yes, that’s how.Link: https://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/2022/08/29/southlake-schools-rejects-in-god-we-trust-signs-featuring-rainbows-arabic/",

        "description": "Melyssa Graham and Stephanie Del Russo.\nOwner and Master Hair Artist Melyssa Graham opened the doors of Thomas Taft Salon on 2nd Avenue in 2013. During Melyssa’s decade-long experience working in Manhattan salons, she bore witness to an odd reality.  Although her industry appeared to be female dominated, most hair salons were owned by men. While she couldn’t be sure, this duplicity seemed to fuel another nagging thought; some of these NYC salons lacked authenticity. Melyssa decided to fill this gap. Incidentally, Thomas Taft Salons is named after Melyssa’s grandfather who owned and operated a hardware store in the Hudson Valley. Clearly, working with her hands is in the genes.\n\nMelyssa has created a salon culture that embraces individuality and expression, creates genuine relationships with her team, clients and other small businesses. “Education is paramount to our culture and success. It’s very humbling and rewarding to be able to foster talented people and watch them grow. It makes everything worth it.” says Melyssa. \nWhile teaming up with Operations &amp; Marketing Manager, Stephanie Del Russo, Thomas Taft Salon has been cited numerous times in national publications, has starred in the CNBC Five Day Biz Fix and grown to three locations. Thomas Taft SoHo opened its doors in 2018, and their newest, UWS location opened last year on 80th and Amsterdam. Their UWS location is particularly unique as they are located inside a collaborative niche work space offering dog grooming and (human) nail services. “The UWS location is an evolution of our brand and a representation of our tenacity. We opened this location during a pandemic so thinking outside the box and embarking on a partnership to share space made sense.” says Stephanie. \nOutside the box thinking is the norm for this business . To embrace mental health awareness, Thomas Taft Salon has been nationally recognized for their innovative silent appointment offering, in which clients can request to receive their service without the typical “small talk”. They also promote mental health care from within to their team to help destigmatize mental health problems.\n\nThe Upper West Side location has a new program, “After Hours Hair” when the salon is open until 11 pm, catering to night owls or those with non-traditional work hours. \nThe salon specializes in blonding, balayage, precision haircuts, and keratin treatments. Whether you’re new to discovering the salon or have been a client for years, you’re invited to the Thomas Taft End of Summer Block Party on September 15th from 4-8 pm at their salon location on 185 W. 80th St. The event will have a live DJ, complimentary dry styling and offerings from small businesses from the area. \nThomas Taft Salon Booking Link: Thomas Taft Salon\nRSVP to End of Summer Block Party:  Stephanie@thomastaftsalon.com",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking temperatures is the main way that health care providers find out if a patient has a fever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing a possible fever could delay treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA study of more than 4,000 patients finds that Black patients are less likely to get an accurate reading with a forehead thermometer than with an oral thermometer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForehead thermometers take temperatures using infrared radiation. Whether the devices can pick up the radiation can be affected by something called skin emissivity. Skin emissivity is how much light, radiation and heat is emitted by the skin, and can be affected by skin pigmentation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a study from Emory University, researchers look at data from 2014 to 2021 for about 2,000 Black patients and 2,000 white patients. They had their temperatures taken by both forehead and oral thermometers within a short time span on their first day in the hospital. For Black patients, the chances of detecting a fever with a forehead thermometer was 26 percent lower than with an oral thermometer. There were no significant differences for white patients.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMissed fevers in Black patients can lead to delayed diagnosis, and potentially increased risk of death down the line. \"If fevers are going undetected, then alerts are not being activated,\" says Sivasubramanium Bhavani, who is the lead author on the study and an assistant professor at Emory, to NPR. \"The differences in detection of fevers could lead to delays in antibiotics and medical care for Black patients.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHealth care professionals have also drawn attention to the racial biases in oximeters, used to measure blood oxygen levels especially during the pandemic. A study published in July in JAMA Internal Medicine found that in a study of pulse oximeters, “there were differences in supplemental oxygen administration between Asian, Black, and Hispanic patients and White patients that were associated with pulse oximeter performance and may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in care.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis thermometer study’s authors state that the errors could be due to not scanning people’s foreheads properly. In a previous study by a different research group, a small study of 65 individuals found that there were no differences in skin emissivity when comparing people grouped by skin pigmentation.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Nintendo Switch; Square Enix/NintendoSeven beautifully unpredictable genre stories, each designed by a different manga artist, are playfully rendered in this novel remakeIn a year where Kate Bush and Metallica re-entered the charts, it’s fitting that 2022’s most intriguing game so far has been plucked from the past. Directed by Takashi Tokita of Chrono Trigger fame, for decades Live a Live appeared destined to remain the RPG that time forgot. Its initial Japanese release on the Super Famicom (SNES) in 1994 was a commercial flop, ensuring it never left its homeland – until now.Resurrected for Nintendo’s fittingly anachronistic current console, the Switch, this eyebrow-raising relic has been reanimated using Square Enix’s gorgeous 2D-HD engine, a graphical style that melds rich high-definition backgrounds with retro 16-bit sprites. The results are glorious, injecting once-flat environments with a playful, eye-catching charm that never quite loses its magic. Continue reading...",

        "description": "I Used to Be Famous unites a washed-up pop idol with an autistic musician. The film-makers reveal why working with a neurodivergent cast was so rewarding‘I’ve always dreamed of being in a boyband,” says director Eddie Sternberg, laughing – then quickly adding for clarity: “I’m kidding!” He’s talking about his debut feature, I Used to Be Famous. It’s the story of a washed-up former pop star played by Deadpool actor Ed Skrein, who gets his musical mojo back by jamming with a talented autistic drummer (played by newcomer Leo Long).Actually, says Sternberg, he got the idea for the film 10 years ago when pop stars started doing comeback tours. “Blue, 5ive, Eternal – all these bands from when I was a kid.” Grabbing at a final 15 minutes of fame, they were only in their late 20s or early 30s. “I found that tragic, the idea of people having their peak in their teens or 20s, then trying to fill that void.

        "description": "Former President Donald Trump’s longtime ally Steve Bannon surrendered Thursday to face state money laundering and conspiracy charges in New York alleging he duped donors who gave money to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Bannon is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday afternoon.Prosecutors say that while Bannon promised donors all the money they gave would go to building the wall, he was involved in funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars to two other people involved in the scheme. The indictment didn&#x27;t identify those people by name, but the details match those of Brian Kolfage and Andrew Badolato, who pleaded guilty to federal charges in April.Bannon’s state-level charges in New York stem from the same alleged conduct as an attempted federal prosecution that ended abruptly, before trial, when Trump pardoned Bannon on his last day in office. Manhattan prosecutors also charged WeBuildTheWall, Inc., a nonprofit entity that Bannon and others allegedly used to solicit donations.Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes, not state offenses. In Bannon’s case, any double jeopardy argument would likely fall flat because his federal case didn’t involve an acquittal or conviction.Bannon, 68, arrived at the Manhattan district attorney&#x27;s office shortly after 9 a.m. Thursday.“This is an irony,” Bannon told reporters as he entered the building.“On the very day the mayor of this city has a delegation down on the border, they are persecuting people here, that try to stop them at the border,” he said, referring to a recent trip by New York City officials to Texas.“This is all about 60 days from the day,” he said, referring to the upcoming national election in November.In an earlier, written statement, Bannon accused Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of pursing “phony charges” against him ahead of the midterm election, saying the Democratic prosecutor targeted him because Bannon and his radio show are popular among Trump’s Republican supporters.Bannon said federal prosecutors “did the exact same thing in August 2020 to try to take me out of the election,” referring to his arrest months before Trump’s reelection loss. “This is nothing more than a partisan political weaponization of the criminal justice system.”Bragg and New York Attorney General Letitia James planned a 1 p.m. news conference to discuss the charges against Bannon.In 2020, federal agents pulled Bannon from a luxury yacht off the Connecticut coast and arrested him on charges he pocketed more than $1 million in wall donations. Prosecutors alleged thousands of investors were tricked into thinking all of their donations would go toward the border wall project, although Bannon instead paid a salary to one campaign official and personal expenses for himself.The states of Texas and Arizona recently began busing asylum-seekers to New York and Washington D.C. in an attempt to ratchet up political pressure on President Joe Biden’s administration to stop people from crossing into their states from Mexico. New York City Mayor Eric Adams recently dispatched a fact-finding team to Texas, partly to find out whether migrants were getting on the buses voluntarily.While the wall Bannon’s group proposed was to be built on the U.S. southern border, more than 1,000 miles from the Big Apple, Manhattan prosecutors have jurisdiction to pursue charges against Bannon because some donors to the effort lived in New York.Federal prosecutors, in the trial of a former Bannon co-defendant, noted that some residents of the New York City area had donated to the wall-building project. One witness that testified was an official with the charities bureau of the New York attorney general’s office who said that a charity backing the wall project had filed paperwork to accept donations in the state. The attorney general’s office is also involved in Bannon’s state criminal case.Bannon, who had pleaded not guilty to the federal charges, was dropped from the federal case when Trump pardoned him.Kolfage and Badolato had been scheduled to be sentenced this week, but that was recently postponed to December. A third defendant’s trial ended in a mistrial in June after jurors said they could not reach a unanimous verdict.In another case not covered by Trump’s pardon, Bannon was convicted in July on contempt charges for defying a congressional subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. He is scheduled to be sentenced in October and faces up to two years in federal prison.",

The Merge will result in a huge energy savings because \"it eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining and instead secures the network using staked ETH,\" the Ethereum currency.

        "description": "The Philadelphia Inquirer published a report on VBit Technologies, later Advanced Mining Group, a company that promised investors to buy and operate Bitcoin miners on their behalf and pay them out the returns. Much of the group's operations relied on a system of \"affiliates\" bringing in more investors—a sort of suspicious triangular-shaped scheme—and executives and top-performing affiliates enjoyed lavish rewards including expensive wines, six-figure sports cars, and fancy vacations.However, customers trying to withdraw their \"rewards\" saw increasing delays in receiving their payouts—days, then weeks, then an indefinite pause. A COO hired by the group left the company only three weeks later. On June 27, the group sent an email to its customers explaining that there was a \"potential pending settlement\" with the SEC—the first customers heard of the existence of any investigation—and that they would no longer serve customers in the U.S. On July 15, the company promised to refund customers what they paid to sign up with the program, but no refunds or further updates have materialized.The company has faced lawsuits in Washington state and Delaware, and apparently operated for two years after executives had acknowledged they were violating securities laws. The Delaware lawsuit describes the operation as a Ponzi scheme, and alleges that the company sold packages that would have required far more computing power than the company actually had access to.\n        \n            \n              \n                \"Investors fear millions lost in Pennsylvania’s largest cryptocurrency scandal based in South Philly\"\n               , The Philadelphia Inquirer",

        "description": "Photo by Michael Owens/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Cabrera has appeared to enjoy his first stint in the major leagues, and despite some poor numbers at the plate, he deserves a chance in the postseason given his skill set. Since joining the Yankees lineup, Oswaldo Cabrera has been fun for everyone to enjoy. His lively personality and embrace of the New York Yankees fanbase have helped fans through this very trying time. The postseason is on the horizon, and plenty players are looking to come back from the injured list, which means there will be odd men out. Players like Giancarlo Stanton and DJ LeMahieu have made their way before but don’t look like themselves, giving players like Cabrera more chance to prove themselves.\nBeing able to play different positions is a huge positive for Cabrera. One would assume being able to play in the outfield and infield well defensively should help him in the eyes of manager Aaron Boone. Specifically, in right field, he has shown the amount of value he can provide, which will come in handy. \nCabrera in right field has 7 DRS and 0 OAA, along with 2 DRS and 1 OAA at shortstop. He has played third and second base defensively, but he has zeroes across the board in those positions. The 7 DRS in right field sits tied for 14th among all outfield positions with Max Kepler, Jose Siri, Eli White, and Nate Eaton. In terms of only right fielders, he sits eighth, which is extremely impressive. \nDespite the 0 OAA in right field, everyone knows the kind of highlight reel plays Cabrera has pulled off. From robbing a home run to gunning down players trying for second base, there’s reason to be excited when this young gun takes to the outfield grass. The tweet below goes even further to showcase how impressive he has been:\n\n\nOswaldo Cabrera among RFs:- +7 DRS (8th)- +3 rARM (5th)- 4 Outfield Assists (T-14th)- 3.0 UZR (9th)In just 91.0 innings in RF, Oswaldo Cabrera has become one of the 10 best defensive RFs in the entire sport. Did I mention he's an infielder? #NYY #RepBX pic.twitter.com/Kg7BzOCcm9— Fireside Yankees (@FiresideYankees) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nThe story around Cabrera would be one thing if he was only a positive defender in one part of the field. But the fact that management and fans don’t have to be worried about him in any position is huge, especially when the Yankees have found ways to hurt themselves through defensive play more than one time over this rollercoaster of a season.\nInjuries continue to be a problem for the Yankees, and with a player like Cabrera on the bench, if something were to happen (knock on wood) in the postseason or a player needs a rest day, he can be of plenty use. The only concern would be what kind of value he’s providing at the plate. As of now, his batting numbers are nothing to brag about. The young utility player is slashing .192/.231/.260 with an OPS+ of 41. Despite the walk-off hit against the Minnesota Twins, his numbers dropped slightly over the double header as he went 2-for-10 with two strikeouts and no walks. Luckily, growing pains are normal. The 23-year-old has not looked strong offensively, but there is still plenty of time to adjust before the postseason arrives. \nNot only is Cabrera a strong defender, but he’s also a switch-hitter. Despite the poor numbers at the plate, the Yankees do have a switch-hitting backup option if they don’t trust the likes of Aaron Hicks, given his offensive and defensive struggles. Cabrera doesn’t look overmatched much, either, which is a good sign. So, his defensive capabilities are there if the team doesn’t trust a player or someone gets hurt, and his ability to make the lineup more diverse as a switch hitter also exists.\nPlaying multiple positions and hitting on both sides of the plate will benefit players in the major leagues. Despite not having much overall MLB experience and some poor at-bat numbers, there is plenty of reason to give him a chance in the postseason lineup. The experience alone for a mature young player will serve him well in the future.",

        "description": "No, not that one. | Photo by George Gojkovich/Getty Images\n    \n\n  How about that? Notes from a busy Wednesday on the Cincinnati Reds farm...\n\nColumbus Clippers 10, Louisville Bats 1 (AAA)\nThat’s disgusting. Revolting. Expected, but revolting. Michael De Leon swatted a solo homer for Louisville’s only run of the game, and Levi Stoudt was off the injured list and on the mound for the start, which was good - he walked a pair in his lone IP, but at least looked to be healthy again. The only other tidbit of note was Matt Reynolds picking up a pair of hits on rehab as he continues to be the Jeff Keppinger of Jack Hannahans.\nThe Bats are 25 games under .500.\nChattanooga Lookouts 3, Birmingham Barons 0 (AA)\nChristian Roa was absolutely brilliant in what was his best start as a professional (so far). He fired 6.0 scoreless, 1-hit innings, allowing just a lone walk while fanning 8 Barons on 77 efficient pitches. That’ll do from the former 2nd round pick, who’s finally rounding into the kind of form that made him an early darling in the short-lived Spincinnati days. Mike Siani had a pair of walks, a pair of hits (one a triple, one a double), swiped his 46th bag of the season, and drove in a trio in a busy day at the plate, while Elly De La Cruz had a hit and a walk and a steal of his own. \nThe Lookouts are 14 games under .500.\nDayton Dragons 5, Lansing Lugnuts 4 (High-A)\nDayton’s insurance run in the Top of the 9th proved large as Lansing rallied for a pair of runs in the Bottom of the 9th, and that’s how this one ended a 1-run win for Dayton. Math! Michel Triana doubled and tripled and drove in a pair, Noelvi “For Vendetta” Marte singled and swiped a bag, Rece “57”Hinds socked a towering double off the LF wall, Austin Hendrick walked twice and scored twice, and that’s about as much box score reading as I can sandwich into one run-on sentence.\nThe Dragons are somehow 5 games over .500.\n\nDaytona Tortugas 9, Tampa Tarpons 8 (Single-A) (F/10)\nDaytona picked up the walk-off victory in extras in this one, presumably as a gifted runner on 2B waltzed across the plate to the bewilderment of anyone who only watched the first 99.7 percent of baseball history. Edwin Arroyo is finally coming around a bit, and he had a right nice 3-hit game that included a double, a stolen bag, a ribbie, and a pair of runs scored. He’s 10 for his last 33 with 4 XBH in that time, which is decidedly better than he was to begin his Cincinnati farm career. A Reds LF named Dunn walked, struck out, and hit a homer in this one for old time’s sake.\nThe Tortugas are 22 games under .500.",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday blasted the side deal that Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) struck earlier this summer to pass a controversial proposal to make it easier to develop fossil fuel-based energy projects.\n\n\n\nSchumer told reporters Wednesday that he plans to attach Manchin’s permitting reform bill to the stopgap spending measure that needs to pass by Sept. 30 to prevent a government shutdown. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nSanders slammed the agreement as “a huge giveaway to the fossil fuel industry” and angrily warned that it would undermine President Biden’s pledge to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent by the year 2030.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I rise this morning to express by strong opposition to the so-called side deal that the fossil fuel industry is pushing to make it easier for them to pollute the environment and destroy our planet,” Sanders said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe said the legislation crafted by Manchin would make it easier for the fossil fuel industry to receive permits and complete what he called “some of the dirtiest and most polluting oil and gas projects in America.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe added the bill would speed the approval of a pipeline spanning from West Virginia to North Carolina that would “generate emissions equivalent to 37 coal plants or over 27 million cars each and every year.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Really, at a time when climate change is threatening the very existence of our planet, why would anybody be talking about substantially increasing carbon emissions and expanding fossil fuel production in the United States?” Sanders asked. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nSanders said he understood the power of oil, gas and coal companies “in our corrupt political system” but called on his colleagues to vote against the deal. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nPairing permitting reform to a continuing resolution gives it a very good chance of passing, even though opposition is building among progressive House Democrats. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nSchumer said he promised to pass the bill in exchange for securing Manchin’s vote last month for the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which will invest more than $300 billion in programs to combat climate change and further develop domestic energy production.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Permitting reform is part of the IRA, and we will get it done,” Schumer said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Democratic leader admitted last month that he was not thrilled to agree to permitting reform, but he noted that it could help the development of renewable energy projects as well as those to extract fossil fuels. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“In terms of the permitting reform, I didn’t like it but it was something that Sen. Manchin wanted,” Schumer told reporters in early August. “And in fact it has some very good things for the environment. It’s going to make permitting easier for clean energy.” &nbsp;&nbsp;",

        "description": "Restating his mission to improve cancer treatment in the U.S., President Biden said: “When we work together in America, there is nothing beyond our capacity. So let’s show the world what’s possible. Let’s show the world we’re committed.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nToday, he and members of Congress have an opportunity to do just that, by supporting the Give Kids a Chance Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and me that would expand children’s access to combination cancer therapy trials—and potentially save countless lives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Congress passed the RACE for Children Act, which Sen. Bennet and I wrote to streamline the approval of pediatric cancer drugs and require that single-drug therapy trials be applied to children as well as adults. According to the chair of the Children’s Oncology Group, it was a “huge…game-changer.” Our new bill builds off of that law’s success to help more children.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMedical doctors describe combination therapies, in which patients are treated with multiple drugs simultaneously, as “a cornerstone of cancer therapy.” They are more effective at counteracting drug-resistant cell growth, metastasis (the spreading of tumors throughout the body), and cancer relapse than single-drug therapies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn combination therapy trials, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves patients’ advance access to innovative combinations of molecularly-targeted oncology drugs or biologics. It’s one of the primary ways in which doctors develop new, life-saving cancer treatments. But because of outdated red tape, those trials are often limited to adults, and children suffering from pediatric cancers are stuck with less effective, single-drug treatments.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere isn’t a good reason to deny children battling a horrible disease the care they need. Fortunately, we don’t have to be satisfied with the status quo. We can make even more progress by further reforming the Pediatric Research Equity Act(PREA) and expanding the RACE for Children Act’s pediatric study requirement to combination therapy trials. That is what our Give Kids a Chance Actwould do.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Pediatric Oncology Section Head of Children’s Hospital Colorado confirms that our bill would “increase access to combinations of target cancer drugs” and bring new hope to “children and families who most need new treatment options.” Nor is that the only testimonial it has received. Dozens of hospitals, advocacy groups, and pediatric cancer research organizations have endorsed the Give Kids a Chance Act. Passing it should be common sense.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe House of Representatives has already incorporated a companion piece of legislation, introduced by Reps. G. K. Butterfield (D-N.C.) and Michael McCaul (R-Texas), into its version of the FDA user fee reauthorization bill. Now it’s time for the House and Senate to incorporate the Give Kids a Chance Actinto the final reauthorization bill, before those fees expire at the end of September, and pass it as soon as possible.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nthirteen-year-old cancer patient Caroline asks us a weighty question: “Combinations of cancer drugs developed for adults should also be studied in kids. Don’t kids with cancer deserve the same chance to be cured?”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe answer to that question is obviously yes. It’s why I call on my fellow policymakers in Washington to support the Give Kids a Chance Act.Our kids shouldn’t have to wait any longer—let’s turn this bill into law without delay.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRubio is the senior senator from Florida.",

President Trump’s Justice Department pushed for a criminal investigation of former Secretary of State John Kerry, an ex-U.S. attorney revealed in a new book, according to&nbsp;The New York Times.\n\n\n\nThe push for an investigation of Kerry was one of several instances in which Trump’s Justice Department pressured the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan to take action against the then-president’s critics, according to Geoffrey Berman, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Berman was fired by Trump in June 2020.\n\n\n\nIn May 2018, the Justice Department told Berman’s office it would be investigating Kerry’s Iran-related conduct, Berman details in his new book “Holding the Line,” out Tuesday, according to the Times.\n\n\n\nThe request came days after Trump publicly attacked Kerry on Twitter over the Iran nuclear deal, which he helped negotiate as head of the State Department in the Obama administration, Berman said. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the accords around the same time.\n\n\n\n“The conduct that had annoyed the president was now a priority of the Department of Justice,” Berman wrote, according to the Times. \n\n\n\nAfter Berman’s office declined to prosecute Kerry, the request was sent to another U.S. attorney’s office, in Maryland, which also declined to prosecute, Berman said in his book, according to the Times.\n\n\n\nIn another case of what he described as a “clear” and “outrageous” pattern, Berman said the Justice Department referred a case against Gregory Craig, former White House counsel for the Obama administration, to his office.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBerman claims he was asked to charge Craig prior to the midterm elections in order to “even things out,” according to the Times.&nbsp;The case was similarly shuffled around to another U.S. attorney’s office after Berman declined to prosecute.\n\n\n\nTrump’s Justice Department also sought to block cases against the former president’s allies, including his personal lawyer Michael Cohen, Berman noted in his book, according to the Times.\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to a Trump spokesperson for comment.",

Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) opened his morning remarks on the floor Thursday by expressing his concern over Queen Elizabeth II's medical condition and praising her as a “historic friend of the United States.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe GOP leader said “our thoughts and our prayers” are with the queen as she battles illness. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nMcConnell said he and many Americans are closely following reports about the British queen’s health as members of the royal family have rushed to her side. The queen is the longest-reigning British monarch in the country's history. \n\n\n\n“The Senate and the American people are watching the news regarding our friends in the United Kingdom and the health of their beloved Queen Elizabeth,” McConnell said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nMcConnell praised the 96-year-old queen, who was coronated in 1953, as “an exemplar of steady leadership and a beloved figure around the world.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“She’s been a historic friend of the United States,” he added. “The decades of her reign have seen a profound deepening of the special relationship between our two countries that has literally changed the world.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrince Harry and his wife Meghan, the duchess of Sussex, have also arrived in Britain from the United States. The two stepped back from their royal duties in 2020. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe queen’s appearance sparked concern earlier this week when she met with new British Prime Minister Liz Truss at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Photographs of the meeting revealed purplish blue markings on the back of the queen’s hand. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11:54 a.m.",

        "description": "Former President Trump on Wednesday backed incumbent Ohio Gov.&nbsp;Mike DeWine&nbsp;(R)&nbsp;in his reelection bid. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Things are really starting to look good in Ohio for Republicans,” Trump said in a statement announcing the endorsement, released by his Save America PAC. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Little has been said about the race for Governor, where we have an outstanding person running, Mike DeWine, who quietly, but professionally and patriotically, goes about doing his job, and really well.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump — who has made a slate of midterm endorsements, notably backing candidates who tout his false claims about election fraud — had previously hinted at someone challenging DeWine in a primary after the governor acknowledged President Biden’s win in the 2020 election.\n\n\n\n“Who will be running for Governor of the Great State of Ohio? Will be hotly contested!” Trump tweeted in 2020 after DeWine, who he'd endorsed in 2018, acknowledged Biden as president-elect.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDeWine had also been booed&nbsp;at one of the then-president's 2020 rallies amid anger over COVID-19 policies.\n\n\n\nThe crowd voiced its displeasure with DeWine after reports that his lieutenant governor, Jon Husted (R), had mentioned wearing masks. \n\n\n\nBut in Wednesday’s endorsement of DeWine, Trump also lauded Husted for boosting Ohio's economy and knocked Democratic gubernatorial candidate Nan Whaley.\n\n\n\nDeWine said on Twitter Wednesday that he and Husted “are grateful for President Trump’s support.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump in his statement noted the high-profile Senate race between Republican candidate J.D. Vance and Rep. Tim Ryan (D).  \n\n\n\nThe former president argued that \"J.D. Vance is pulling ahead of a 'RINO Democrat,' Tim Ryan, who has tied himself to me rather than Biden, yet he’s voted 100% for Biden’s destructive economic policies.”&nbsp;",

        "description": "President Biden committed&nbsp;$80 billion over the next decade&nbsp;to support the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and provide help for IRS agents to get their job done. Republicans are crying foul, suggesting that every American will be targeted for unnecessary and unwelcomed harassment, especially&nbsp;small business owners. Like any partisan response, the truth typically falls somewhere in the middle.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPerhaps instead of throwing money at a&nbsp;tax code and taxation system&nbsp;that is designed, as some argue, to leave “billions on the table,” the time is ripe to revamp the tax code, which has&nbsp;almost 10,000 sections&nbsp;and has been&nbsp;amended over 4,000 times just over the past decade.\n\n\n\nThe goal should be to create a simplified taxation system so that everyone can better understand how much taxes they are paying, with the IRS bureaucracy minimized, and taxes collected with greater ease for all.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo, what are some options that are used in other countries?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA&nbsp;flat tax&nbsp;imposes a single tax rate for all taxpayers. A&nbsp;value added tax, or VAT, taxes consumption rather than income.\n\n\n\nThe argument against both these taxation systems is that they are not sufficiently&nbsp;progressive&nbsp;to tax high-income earners enough, and they overly burden low-income earners. Yet, this is exactly the effect of the current tax code.\n\n\n\nThe people who benefit the most from a&nbsp;complex tax code are high-income earners. They are the people who exploit tax laws and rules that enable them to pay less taxes. Many such efforts are legal and well within the tax code, either explicitly or by interpretation.\n\n\n\nThe problem is that as the tax code has been revised and updated incrementally over the years, it has created legal and legitimate tax avoidance crevices that those with high incomes and in many cases, diverse income sources, can exploit.\n\n\n\nSimplifying the tax code will remove such opportunities and make it more difficult for anyone to avoid paying taxes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTax reform is often portrayed as needing to&nbsp;collect more taxes from the wealthiest earners. The data shows that&nbsp;high-income earners already pay a large proportion of federal taxes. For example, in 2019, the top half of all taxpayers paid 97 percent of all individual income taxes. Moreover, the top 1 percent of all taxpayers paid over 38 percent of all individual income taxes collected.\n\n\n\nOne question up for debate is whether such percentages are adequate. Should the 97 percent be 98 or even 99.5 percent? Should the 38 percent be 50, 60 or 80 percent?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStories about how the&nbsp;wealthiest people in America avoid paying taxes contain some elements of truth, yet are facilitated by the current tax code. For example, capital gains are only taxed when they are realized, which makes sense. Moreover, the wealthiest “tax avoiders” are extreme outliers among not just all taxpayers, but also among the majority of American high-income earners. Lastly, these “tax avoiders” are just following the tax code. Articles about such tax avoidance strategies make good social media posts, fueling ill-will against such people, but result in no effective changes in our tax code.\n\n\n\nBeing wealthy or being a high earner should not be a crime nor viewed with disdain. Many such people worked long hours to achieve their income capabilities. Some were in the right place at the right time. Some were shrewd and calculated. Some benefited from good luck. Some won the genetic lottery and were born into wealth. Many amassed their wealth through intelligent risk-taking and hard work.\n\n\n\nThrowing more money, in this case, $80 billion, at a broken tax code is nothing more than a bandage when more complex surgery is needed. Unfortunately, Congress does not seem motivated to undertake such a tax code revision. The tax preparation industry would lobby against it. Elected officials will not earn goodwill among voters. Revamping the tax code is viewed as a low-priority item compared to other more pressing issues that are under discussion in Washington.\n\n\n\nYet, a tipping point is fast approaching.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the federal deficit continues to grow, now over&nbsp;$30 trillion, there will be a need to rewrite the tax code.\n\n\n\nWith higher interest rates that will increase federal debt payments, consuming a greater share of the federal budget, lawmakers will need to find ways to keep the government funded and open. Everyone will need to contribute, and the pain will be felt across all income levels. The alternative is the inability of the federal government to pay its bills. In such a case, the primary objective would not be fairness, but solvency.\n\n\n\nTo avoid such chaos, the time to revise the tax code is now.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSheldon&nbsp;H.

Despite this known turn of the fiscal calendar, it seems to catch our national and congressional leadership by surprise most years as the clock winds down and time runs out to complete annual appropriations bills, the only real must-pass legislation of the year.\n\n\n\nAs a stop gap, or bridge, or whatever we want to call it, failure to enact annual appropriations results in continuing resolutions (CRs), which extend current year funding and priorities into the next year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe federal government has operated under CRs in all but three of the last 46 years. The Department of Defense (DOD) has operated under CRs for 1,500 days since 2010. That is over four years of budget stagnation and uncertainty, requiring incremental, inefficient funding solutions and delays in starting new programs and innovative solutions to address our most pressing national security challenges.\n\n\n\nFor the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1, a CR would mean $207 million per day in lost buying power. If the CR lasts until the end of November, $12.6 billion will be lost. These are big numbers. For context, $207 million buys 55 long-range anti-ship missiles; $12.6 billion buys two DDG-51 Arleigh Burke destroyers plus the department’s entire fiscal year 2023 planned investment in&nbsp;developing and fielding a mix of multi-service, multi-domain offensive long-range weapons.\n\n\n\nDeputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said recently that the department must shrink the “’lab-to-fab’ timeline from decades to years, or even months” if it is to meet the “pacing challenge” posed by China.\n\n\n\nWhat stops speed and innovation? Funding bills that incrementally extend last year’s priorities and money into the next year, increasing the technology “valley of death” where innovative technologies fail to make it through production and into warfighters hands and pushing small innovative companies out of the DOD orbit, and sometimes out of business altogether.\n\n\n\nToday, the disruptive, dangerous and wasteful impacts of CRs are better known and understood by more people than at any time in the past, due in part to a House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing held on Jan. 12, 2022.\n\n\n\nAt that hearing, Defense Department witnesses, led by DOD Comptroller Mike McCord and including the uniform leadership of each military service, made clear that CRs have immediate and long-term, operational and strategic effects. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen C.Q. Brown summed it up well: “All the money in the world cannot buy more time; time is irrecoverable, and when you are working to keep pace against well-resourced and focused competitors, time matters.”\n\n\n\nThe effects of continuing resolutions will be further magnified this year due to inflation, which is&nbsp;hitting the workforce&nbsp;and industry hard.&nbsp;A group of industrial associations&nbsp;reportedly met&nbsp;with McCord to discuss including anomalies or exceptions in the CR this fall to mitigate some of the negative impacts of inflation.\n\n\n\nThough a well-meaning attempt to put a bandage on the problem, Congress almost never approves such exceptions, favoring instead a “clean” extension of funds to keep the pressure on reaching a budget agreement which would enable enactment of appropriations bills. Makes you wonder though, pressure on whom?\n\n\n\nThose really hurt by CRs are those held hostage by them, not those who can fix the problem. If it were administration and congressional leadership jobs or finances at stake, CRs would disappear as a funding option. But those who experience negative impacts from CRs in the near term are the defense workforce, the communities where they operate and live and the companies and industry with whom they do business. In the long term, it is our national security and place as a global leader that suffer.\n\n\n\nHow do we get real action to solve this problem? If our leaders can’t get their fundamental job done, enacting annual appropriations on time, maybe they shouldn’t get paid. Or they should take a pay cut that is somehow mathematically relevant to the taxpayer money and competitiveness lost by the use of CRs.\n\n\n\nOnce they get their job done, they would again get paid. Such an idea sounded a bit crazy in the past. But nothing else has worked so far to motivate our leadership to come together on budget agreements in time to support our military competitiveness and national defense.\n\n\n\nSo, now it seems like a viable option to put the pain of CRs where it can do some good. Otherwise, we might as well accept defeat and submit to this avoidable self-inflicted wound and shoot the hostage, again.\n\n\n\nElaine&nbsp;McCusker&nbsp;is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

        "description": "Fiscal 2022 is on track to become the deadliest year on record for migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a report by CNN.\n\n\n\nSince Oct. 1 of last year, when fiscal 2022 started, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials have registered 748 migrant deaths at the border, according to the report.\n\n\n\nThat's on track to surpass the number of deaths registered in fiscal 2021, when 557 migrant deaths were registered, setting a grim record.\n\n\n\nThe final figure for deaths in 2022 is certain to continue climbing in September, as high temperatures persist in much of the Southwest.\n\n\n\nAnd the figures reported by DHS only take into account deaths confirmed by border officials, potentially undercounting hundreds of people who have perished in their attempts to enter the United States.\n\n\n\nThe rising lethality of border crossings is fueled by a variety of factors, including high temperatures, an uptick of migrant crossings in the traditionally quieter summer months and crossings in increasingly remote areas, in part to avoid border barriers.\n\n\n\nMigration has also remained high for much of 2022, and more migrants are coming from beyond Mexico and Central America's so-called Northern Triangle, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\n\n\nThe uptick in migrants from farther-away countries could also contribute to the crossing's lethality.\n\n\n\nDHS numbers have shown a steep rise in the number of migrants from places like Cuba, Venezuela and Haiti this year.\n\n\n\nOften, those migrants are unfamiliar with the terrain along the U.S.-Mexico border, are more highly reliant on smugglers to find routes into the United States and have deteriorating health after long treks through Central America and Mexico.",

        "description": "Photo by Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Due to some budget cuts, Purple Row will look different heading into the offseason and beyond Dear Purple Row readers:\nI am writing to you to let you know of some changes that will be coming to Purple Row in the coming months. We were informed on August 30 by SB Nation that we were among multiple MLB sites who were having their budgets cut due to a dip in page views. Specifically, our already-limited Purple Row budget was cut by 2⁄3 and we had to make quick personnel decisions based on this new budget. Our daily posting expectations have also been lowered to once per day during the regular season, rather than twice per day.\nAfter many hours of deliberations among the leadership team, you will see the following changes to Purple Row:\n\nWe are saying goodbye to Becca Guillen, who has been an outstanding writer, editor and social media guru for the past three years. She will be sorely missed, but she will always be part of the Purple Row and Rockies Twitter communities.\nDuring the offseason, you will continue to see Rockpiles as is normal. We’ll also continue with our Ranking the Rockies series at the conclusion of the 2022 season. During the regular season, you will continue to see Rockpiles but will only see game threads on game days. We will link to an outside recap at the conclusion of the games. There may be extra feature pieces written on occasion, but they will be fewer and far between. Stay tuned while we work out the details!\n\nOther things will stay the same:\n\nThe rest of the staff will be staying on, but they will be in different roles so you might see bylines doing new things.\n“Affected by Altitude” and “The Pebble Report Podcast” will continue recording for your listening pleasure!\nI will be remaining at the helm as site manager for the time being.\n\nAt Purple Row, we have always prided ourselves on providing quality content over chasing page views and posting click bait. We will continue this mission going forward. We have also grown massive communities within the Denver area, on social media and through our podcasts, though those weren’t taken into account in the decision. We will continue to foster those, as well.\nWe are disappointed with the decision by SB Nation, but are grateful for our team of writers and to our loyal readers. Thank you for your continued support as we navigate this transition, and we look forward to continuing to bring you excellent coverage of the Rockies (however frustrating they may be). Stay tuned for what’s next!\nCheers,\n-Sam",

        "description": "A rescued pitbull named Bam Bam was shown the beautiful colors of the fall season in Oregon by his loving human for the very first time.  \n\n\n\nThis is his first fall of his life I’m excited to show him everything about fall.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNate had adopted Bam Bam from Real Good Rescue in Los Angeles and had never seen this change of season before. Nate gladly shared all the autumn traditions, including enjoying a (dog-safe) pumpkin latte, running into leaf piles, and picking pumpkins together.  Bam Bam really enjoyed the pumpkin patch.\n\n\n\nWe took him out to the pumpkin patch as soon as I let him off leash, he just started bolting around. He ended up picking the pumpkins that we ultimately picked and harvested. He was just… holding it like, ‘Yep, this is the pumpkin. We&#8217;re taking this one home’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBam Bam appeared to have lost all hope after he was owner-surrendered to a shelter. Terah Gisolo, the founder of Real Good Rescue, saw the signs and knew that he wouldn&#8217;t live very long if kept in that environment. She took him home and fostered him for a while. He was incredibly fearful of everything until he began to spend time outdoors. Gisolo then realized that Bam Bam would be the perfect dog for one of her best friends. \n\n\n\nHe was still very fearful. I would take him for hikes. That&#8217;s when I started to really see him open up and blossom. There was a chance that he would get adopted by someone in LA but my best friend; he&#8217;s a super athlete. I basically told him that I had found his dog",

        "description": "Adric and the bullpen. May 29, 2022. | Michael elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n    \n\n  The Guide explores Chase Field On the Road with Eli(zondo) and Adric at Chase Field.\n\nSo you’ve decided to heed the call to adventure. Good for you. If you need to refer back to what the Guide actually is or who I actually am, please refer to the included links.\n\nDodger Stadium East - The Solution to the Angkor Wat problem\n  \n        \n      Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n  \nIntroduction\n\nThe Guide has the following to say about going to a game at Chase Field:\nThis place is a testament to man’s hubris. /sounds of melting.\nFair warning, if you go to Phoenix, you are going to be in the desert and odds are high that the temperature will be hot. You will have only two saving graces: 1) it will be a dry heat, so drinking water and staying in the shade will be more effective than if you were in humid heat; and 2) if it’s hot outside, odds are good that the roof of Chase Field will be closed, and it will be comfortable inside.\n\nGoing to Chase Field solves the Dodger fans’ Angkor Wat problem. What is the Angkor Wat problem, you ask. As you may or may not know, I spent six months in 2016 working and living in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, while working at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, i.e. the war crimes cases. There are three things that people do when they go to Cambodia:\n  \n        \n      Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n      Angkor Wat at dawn. May 8, 2016.\n  \n\nVisit Angkor Wat - the world's largest and arguably most beautiful religious site.\nVisit the Killing Fields at Choeung Ek, just outside the capital - where thousands were killed during the Khmer Rouge reign and where human remains still bleed up to the surface during the rainy season\nVisit Tuol Sleng / S-21 - inside Phnom Penh, the most infamous prison of the Khmer Rouge regime.\n\nContrary to popular belief, there are other temples to visit in Cambodia. Most people commit a classic error though: they visit Angkor Wat first and then are subsequently underwhelmed by all other temples they might visit. How does this problem relate to the Dodgers, you might ask. Through the Guide, I have been a passionate advocate of visiting PNC Park in Pittsburgh and Busch Stadium in St. Louis, because they are great stadiums. But if you visit them first, every other stadium is underwhelming by comparison. Chase Field solves this problem as discussed below.\nThe following is all you will need to know about going to a Dodgers/Diamondbacks game at Chase Field.\nThe Five Questions of the Guide:\n1. Is it worth going here?\nYes, but you really do not need to go more than once for a weekend series - unless you live nearby.\n  \n        \n      Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n      Chase Field. May 28, 2022.\n  \nChase Field is fine. While brief, that description is most apt to describe going to a game in Phoenix. Now, I would admittedly be underwhelmed if Chase Field was my home ballpark as the park could use some TLC and modernization of amenities and features. However, if you visit during a Dodgers series, the stadium will be packed and lively and feel like a home game. It is an odd thing when the home team gets booed during player introductions, but here we are. After speaking to the locals, being outnumbered at home is a fact of life for the Phoenix faithful.\n\nTherefore, for this reason, Chase Field serves as an excellent introduction to traveling for Dodgers baseball. This assertion is especially true if you are someone who does not travel very much but has been inspired to venture out to see the Dodgers in person outside of your normal routine. While Chase Field is outclassed by other ballparks, it serves as a de facto Dodger Stadium East, allowing a Dodger fan to experience a home away from home, if they happen to go see a Dodgers/Diamondbacks game. \nFor the first-timer at Chase Field, you can go to Guest Services and they will give a postcard-sized cardboard certificate that you can fill out yourself to mark the occasion. If you buy your tickets directly from the team, you can pay a surcharge for a novelty-sized paper ticket with your specific seat information. \n2. How should I get there?\n  \n        \n      Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n      Outside Chase Field. June 19, 2021.\n  \nI normally fly to Phoenix, but on occasion, I have been part of the ten-hour drive from Central California to Phoenix. I would not repeat that. While getting around Phoenix by way other than the automobile is generally not recommended, if you follow the advice of this Guide, you should be able to get to and/or from the ballpark from your accommodations.\nSome hotels offer complimentary shuttles to the game, and rideshare tends to be hit or miss depending on the traffic around the ballpark. With this ballpark, in particular, the best advice I have is that if you are not driving yourself, you would be best served by arriving at the ballpark early. At worst, you can catch batting practice.\n3. Where should I stay?\n  \n        \n      Courtesy of Google Maps / Illustration by Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n      Two real options unless you want to rent a car.\n  \nAs you can see, you have a bunch of hotel options near Chase Field. Now, if you want to rent a car, then I would simply suggest finding someplace that has the best bargain because, at that point, the hotel selection becomes a grab bag. If you want to forgo a car, I have circled two options for you. I have previously stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn (2021) and the SpringHill Suites (2022).\nThe Garden Inn is a nicer hotel, and it’s right in the heart of downtown so if you wanted to mingle/socialize/do other stuff after the ballgame. Plus, for the directionally challenged like myself, it is easier to make your way to the Garden Inn from Chase Field, as there are more landmarks to use for navigation. SpringHill is cheaper but has an hourly shuttle that will drop you off by Chase Field if you inform the front desk that you would like to head to Chase Field. Supposedly you can also arrange transport back to the hotel with this shuttle, but if you get yourself turned around leaving Chase Field, it is just easier to walk back to the hotel. However, SpringHill is the inferior of the two hotels and is not by anything of consequence. Needless to say, if you go in the wrong direction, you will be wandering around for a bit. Walking yourself back to either hotel is far easier at night, even with the heat. I would not walk to any of the hotels outside the snapshot, especially in the heat.\n4. Where should I sit?\n  \n        \n      Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n      Outside Chase Field. June 19, 2021.\n  \nSeating at Chase Field is also a more streamlined experience than at other ballparks. As Chase Field is typically overrun with fellow Dodger fans, unless you are incredibly introverted, you are likely to have fun interacting with others at the ballpark. The general rule of thumb is to avoid the upper deck at Chase Field - you don’t need to sit that high if you want to watch a game at Chase. \nAlso, the prices at Chase are generally reasonable to the point where you can sit anywhere on the ground level with the only limiting factor being your budget. So instead of doing the usual categories of budget, fun, and value, this entry of the Guide is going to split up seating into the following two categories.\n“I’m here to watch the game!” \n  \n        \n      Courtesy of the Arizona Diamondbacks / Illustration by Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n      You have plenty of seats to choose from.\n  \nAs you can see, you have plenty of options. Do you want to be able to order food and have it delivered to you? Then sit in Club Seats just above field level. The food itself is fine, if unremarkable. The venue could lean into its Southwest flavor profile a little bit more, but that is a personal note of taste.\n  \n        \n      Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n      My seat on May 28, 2022 at Chase Field.\n  \nIf you want a great view of the game, then sit on the field level. The priciest seats are the seats closest to home plate or the dugouts. But if you sit in the sections immediately behind what I have just described, the prices are quite reasonable and the view you get is quite good for what you are paying for.\n  \n        \n      Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n      Field level at Chase Field, during batting practice. June 19, 2021.\n  \nRegardless of where you pick, if you follow the advice of the Guide, you will have a great view of the game and will likely be surrounded by Dodgers fans.\n“I want to enjoy my surroundings!”\n  \n        \n      Courtesy of the Arizona Diamondbacks / Illustration by Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n      I would just go to a bar, but different strokes for different folks. \n  \nThere is also a bar in the Club Seating area, but the general rule of thumb is that in the seats that I have identified, you are generally too far away from the action to actually watch the game, apart from on a monitor.\n  \n        \n      Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n      From the bullpen seats, just after the game. Chase Field. May 29, 2022.\n  \nGranted, you can see different aspects of the game that you would not be able to see while watching the game at home. But even if you get up to get something to eat, you will likely have the best results at Chase Field by sitting with a group if you choose to sit in the identified seats.\n  \n        \n      Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n      From deep right field, while grabbing food. Chase Field. May 29, 2022.\n  \nIt is worth noting that I have yet to visit Chase Field while the dome is open, so I cannot remark as to the conditions of Chase Field when the dome is open. When the dome is closed, the stadium is fine, not too hot, not too cold, not too breezy. It is like sitting and watching a game in a giant hangar, which is what the stadium essentially is when the dome is closed. The team posts whether the dome will be open or closed on its website before each series so you can plan accordingly.\n5. After your trip, is it worth going back?\nHey, that was fun, but I probably don’t need to do that again.\n  \n        \n      Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n      Outside Chase Field. May 29, 2022\n  \nI attended three games at Chase Field in 2021 and 2022. The Dodgers have won every time. Do not take my recommendation as proof that Chase Field provides a subpar experience for a Dodgers fan. It does not - at all. As the analogy goes, going to a game at Chase Field is like hanging out in the shallow end of a swimming pool when you cannot swim. Sometimes all you need is a quick dip in the pool to cool off or a halfway step to going on the road to watch the Dodgers. Unless you have another reason for being in Phoenix, going to Chase Field for a weekend series is likely enough for most Dodgers fans during a lifetime. But if you wish to go more often, you will likely have a good time, but there are better venues to repeatedly visit.\n  \n        \n      Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n      Adric: See you next time!",

        "description": "Since moving into the rotation May 30, Spencer Strider has 146 strikeouts, tied with the Yankees’ Gerrit Cole for the MLB lead. | D. Ross Cameron-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Piecing together a playoff rotation will come down to a tough decision. Plus, the Braves and Ronald Acuña Jr. are benefitting from universal DH and more  It’s like getting atop the National League East last season after not getting over .500 until Aug. 4 wasn’t hard enough, so the Atlanta Braves went into the MLB game settings and turned the difficulty settings from Expert to Ludicrous Mode.\nTrailing since Opening Day, the Braves moved into a tie atop the division Tuesday, and after the New York Mets’ swept a Wednesday double header with the Pittsburgh Pirates, the deficit sits at a mere half game.\nThis is the latest in franchise history in which the Braves have either moved into a tie or taken the division lead for the first time, surpassing the 1916 and 1883 teams, which did so on Sept. 4.\nIt’s been a remarkable climb for the Braves, and arguably more impressive than a year ago, because this hasn’t been the byproduct of a Mets collapse. Since June 1, New York is 53-24 — a 98-win pace — while Atlanta has played at a 117-win pace with a 63-24 record.\nThe strength of schedule remains a factor, with the Mets benefitting from the easiest slate of any team with a .432 opponent winning percentage. Outside of the sliding Milwaukee Brewers, the Braves are the only winning team New York faces the rest of the way (though that schedule didn’t exactly play in its favor in allowing a combined 22 runs in three straight losses to the Washington Nationals and Pirates). \nThe Mets will face the Miami Marlins this weekend, and after taking two games vs. the Oakland A’s, those difficulty settings are being tweaked again for the Braves, who will face the Seattle Mariners, who are in position to make the postseason. \nThere’s no margin of error for either side as the East race continues, with the potential that Sept. 30-Oct. 2 series between the Braves and Mets at Truist Park will loom large.\nJust remember as the defending champions keep breathing down the Mets’ necks: someone had the audacity to call this race back in May.\n\n\nPremium gas ⛽️ pic.twitter.com/ij6WB3lBfT— Bally Sports: Braves (@BravesOnBally) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n1. Who gets squeezed out of the postseason rotation?\nSpencer Strider is electric. There’s no other way to put it. He’ll either finish first or second in the National League Rookie of the Year race, is bound to get votes for the Cy Young Award and is on his way to making rookie history with 13.7 strikeouts per nine, which would break Kerry Wood’s 1998 record of 12.6.\nBut if the Braves follow traditional thinking and shrink down to three starter — specifically over the best-of-three Wild Card Series, if they have to play it, and the best-of-five Division Series — is he automatically in the rotation?\nGrant McAuley and I got into this last weekend on From the Diamond on 92.9 The Game, but to dig a little deeper ...\nMax Fried’s name is set in stone as the staff’s unquestioned ace, but if manager Brian Snitker has two pick from Strider, Charlie Morton and Kyle Wright, who is potentially out of a rotation spot until the League Championship Series? \nWright, the MLB wins leader, is in the midst of the best season of his career with a 3.23 ERA and 2.4 fWAR and Morton has a 2.70 ERA with 34 punch outs and eight walks. Strider has been on another level with a  1.45 ERA with 45 strikeouts and seven walks in his last four starts, has a 4.5 fWAR that trails only Fried (4.9) among Braves starters, and his 13.65 K/9 is the best in baseball with a minimum of 96 innings.\nNot starting the rookie would seem insane, right?\nThe counter to the argument can be Wednesday’s outing for the woeful A’s. Strider threw 34 pitches over that first frame, struggling to find the strike zone as he walked three and gave up a double in allowing two runs. Strider made adjustments and rebounded in impressive fashion, retiring 16 of the last 17 he faced and finished with nine strikeouts, but in a postseason setting, does he even get the chance to get back on track when everything’s heightened?\nThen there’s the potential that each time Strider toes the rubber he completely overmatches a lineup, like that 16-strikeout outing vs. the Rockies. But does he become that much more dangerous in the playoffs if you could throw him multiple times when it comes to the five- and seven-game series? \nStrider’s emergence helped answer how the Braves were going to solidify the backend of the rotation. That same emergence is going to create some handwringing when it comes to figuring out how all the pieces fit together in the postseason. \n2. Acuña and the Braves’ stroke of luck \nWith Wednesday’s win in Oakland, the Braves improved to 11-0 in the last 11 games in which Ronald Acuña Jr. was in the lineup. The last seven of those Acuña has been at designated hitter as he nurses a sore knee stemming from his offseason surgery. While there’s the chance he plays right field occasionally over the coming weeks, the hopes are that playing it safe now will allow the two-time All-Star to be back in the field in the postseason.\nIt’s a luxury, and it’s a luxury that underscores that the defending champs are among the teams making the most out of the DH coming to the NL full time.\nAcuña is hitting 35 percent above league average at DH with a 0.7 fWAR that’s higher than the DH split of every other player the Braves have used in that spot (minus-2.0) combined. That 135 wRC+ is the fourth highest among NL DHs with a minimum of 90 PAs, a list headed by Bryce Harper (167 wRC+), whose Phillies are another team that’s taken full advantage of pitchers no longer hitting.\nIf there was no DH, baseball would potentially be without two of its biggest stars. Maybe the Braves would push the issue with Acuña, who is basically managing pain after his recovery, but Harper was DHing because he can’t throw the ball, with Tommy John surgery potentially in his future.\nAre those purists that hated the universal DH still loathing it?\n\n3. Jansen rebounded, but should Iglesias be getting more save opportunities?\nAfter blowing his second save in four appearances, Kenley Jansen was back at it in a one-run game Tuesday night, slamming the door on the A’s in a 10-9 win for his 32nd save of the season.\nJansen was back at his Jansen best, with the cutter generating a 75 percent whiff rate (it was at 33 percent or lower in five of his six previous appearances), and nine of the 12 pitches he threw were strikes.\nThe veteran may have corrected the mechanical issues that haunted him amid a 15.00 ERA over a four-game stretch, but it also feels like a missed opportunity to have taken advantage of the depth of the bullpen. Shutting down the league’s 27th-ranked offense is a step forward, but it may not prove a solution. \nRaisel Iglesias has allowed one run over 14 2/3 innings (0.61 ERA) with a .143 batting average against since being acquired ahead of the Aug. 2 deadline, with just one save. He’s pitched in the seventh inning three times in six appearances since Aug. 26, the eighth once and the ninth twice in that span. \nManager Brian Snitker has reiterated that he won’t pitch Jansen unless the Braves have a lead or in a tie game, and certainly utilizing Iglesias the way they are figures to make him a daunting weapon in the postseason. But Iglesias also gives the Braves the option to put Jansen in lower stress innings.\nIt was surprising, but not unexpected to see Jansen come out in the ninth in his first chance after a blown save. It worked, but if ever there was a time to break out of the traps of bullpen arms having their “roles” this would have been it. \n\n\nWelcome back, Matty O!@mattolson21 | #ForTheA pic.twitter.com/b6c0WvryOp— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n4. Who ordered more damage vs. lefty starters?\nThe Braves just keep feasting on left-handed pitching, with the game’s second-best wRC+ (124), OPS (.807) and wOBA (.351) and third-best average (.272). They kept that going vs. the A’s, getting to Cole Irvin for nine runs on Tuesday and Ken Waldichuk for three more Wednesday.\nThat success figures to be key as Atlanta keeps chasing another East title.\nThe Mariners will roll out two southpaws in this weekend’s series, with Robbie Ray — whose August included 11.18 K/9 — on Friday and Marco Gonzales (3.98 ERA over 27 starts) on Sunday.\nShould current rotation turns hold, the Braves are in line to face 10 left-handers over the final 25 games, including two within the seventh highest ERAs by lefty starters in the Nationals’ Patrick Corbin (5.68) and Marlins’ Trevor Rogers (5.19). \n \n\n\nthis is 21-yr-old Vaughn Grissom's 1st career 4-hit game. Michael Harris II has 2 such gamesit's the 3rd time since at least 1901 the Braves have gotten 4+ hit games from 2 players under 22 in the same season, along with:2018: Acuña, Albies1913: Rabbit Maranville, Les Mann— Sarah Langs (@SlangsOnSports) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n5. Braves and Mariners serving up youth\nYoung talent. Everywhere.\nIt’s been a key element for the Braves and Mariners in their runs to the postseason, as the only teams in the majors with a rookie position player and pitcher in the top five in fWAR.\nStrider leads all rookies (4.5), while Seattle matches his impact with a right-hander of their own in George Kirby, who tops American League rookie pitchers (2.4 fWAR), and the Braves’ Michael Harris II and Julio Rodriguez are tied for the position player lead at 4.2 fWAR. Atlanta is also getting 1.2 worth of WAR out of Vaughn Grissom, who is also hitting 64 percent above league average hitting through 103 plate appearances. \nIf Strider hadn’t made his rotation turn in Oakland, each one would be in action in this series, as Kirby will start Saturday’s game opposite Max Fried. But it will be a showcase nonetheless for two teams that have made securing youth a priority, as within the last month both the Braves (Harris) and Mariners (Rodriguez) inked young stars with less than a year service time to extensions. \n\n\n\"Austin Riley gave me his bat.\"@GrissomVaughn has a simple explanation for his latest hot streak.@Kelly_Crull catches up with the rookie after another @Braves win. pic.twitter.com/ESH094ukLh— Bally Sports: Braves (@BravesOnBally) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n6. Grissom on yet another tear\nSpeaking of those rookies, just when it looked like Vaughn Grissom was slowing down, he’s caught fire again, with some help from Austin Riley.\nHitting .420 on Aug. 23, the rookie second baseman’s average dropped to .311 on Aug. 31 as he went 2-for-25 over a six-game stretch. Since then, though, he’s 10 for 21 with two home runs, two doubles and six RBI, pushing his season average up to .347. Grissom torched A’s pitching for six hits in the two-game series, including four on Tuesday.\nThe secret? A new bat courtesy of the Braves’ All-Star third baseman. \n“I went a lot of cold for a little while. I was just missing pitches that I was given,” he said Wednesday. “Honestly, Austin Riley gave me his bat. I was a little cold and he told me to switch bats and he thought it was the wood was a little wet, a little soggy. So, I got a different bat and doing well with it.”\nSince Grissom debuted on Aug. 10, his 164 wRC+ is sixth best in the majors among players with at least 100 plate appearances in that span, trailing only the New York Yankees’ Matt Carpenter (218) and Aaron Judge (202), St. Louis Cardinals’ Paul Goldschmidt (188), Houston Astros’ Yordan Alvarez (176) and Los Angeles Angels’ Mike Trout (170). \n\n\nMedical Update on Huascar Ynoa: RHP Huascar Ynoa underwent successful surgery today to reconstruct the ulnar collateral ligament in his right arm.

Surprise seemed to be collective reaction to the Braves’ tweet Wednesday that the right-hander had undergone successful Tommy John surgery. \nGiven the timing, and the typical recovery time, it’s likely that the 24-year-old Ynoa will miss all of next season as well, further derailing what looked to be a promising young arm in the rotation.\nHe posted a 3.09 ERA over eight promising starts last season with 50 strikeouts to 11 walks, but that progress, and to this point his career, were derailed when he punched a dugout bench after a May 16 outing in Milwaukee in which he allowed five runs on nine hits. \nYnoa hasn’t been the same since, returning to post a 5.05 ERA in nine games over the balance of 2021 and started two games this season, pitching to a 13.50 ERA in 6 2/3 innings. He was recalled in in August, but never pitched over his three before being optioned back to Gwinnett and hadn’t appeared in a game in two weeks before the surgery announcement. \nYnoa is arbitration eligible for the first time this winter, and given the inconsistencies, there’s the chance that the Braves don’t extend him a contract. Regardless, it’s going to be a while before we see Ynoa again, whether that’s on the mound for Atlanta or another club.\n8. The odds are growing ever in their favor\nFanGraphs still says the Mets are the favorite to win the division, with a 63.9 percent chance to the Braves’ 36.1 percent, as of Thursday. Of course, that’s a dramatic change from June 1, when Atlanta had a mere 16 percent chance to claim the East, and things have also improved on the betting side.\nPer SportsBetting.ag, the Braves have gone from +450 two weeks ago, +575 three weeks ago, and as high as +700 on Aug. 9 in the division, all the way down to +125. Their World Series odds, which were +1800 the first week of June, have been cut down to +800, and they are +375 to represent the NL in the Fall Classic.\n9. On this day in Braves history, Cesar Cedeno went into the stands\nIn 1981, Cesar Cedeno gave all hecklers something to think about. The Astros’ first baseman was taking his position at Atlanta Stadium in the first half of an eventual 3-2 Braves’ win, when he said he was being berated by fans. \n“I have my family along on the trip,’ Cedeno said. “I do not enjoy anybody calling me anything that I’m not. Just for the fact that somebody paid six dollars I don’t have to be insulted up to the point where they called my name and I turn around and they’re gonna point at me and curse me out. I would not go for that.”\nCedeno jumped into the stands and fought with fans, and several of his teammates had to go into the stands to separate Cedeno from the fans. \nThe stadium operations’ director said the fans were calling Cedeno, who had pled guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the 1973 death of a girl who he shot as they wrestled for a gun in a motel, “killer.” \nCedeno was initially suspended, though that was lifted for what NL president Charles Feeney called “mitigating circumstances,” including remarks that “went beyond the realm of decency.” The Astro was fined $5,000 and Cedeno sent a letter of apology to the fan.",

        "description": "COVID-19 and HIV offer lessons for the monkeypox pandemic, says microbiologist Joseph Osmundson.\nOsmundson has been drawn to microbes—particularly viruses—since he was a kid, in part from growing up in the 1980s in the shadow of HIV. (&#8220;A virus with nine genes that could kill you? How could that type of mystery not astound and shock?&#8221; he explains.)\nIn college, he began studying the evolution of viruses like HIV, and since then has dedicated his scientific career to unraveling the mysteries of microbes. But Osmundson, now a clinical assistant professor of biology at New York University, also found that viruses are too complex to understand with science alone.\nThat&#8217;s where writing came in.\nOsmundson had been writing about HIV for publications like The Village Voice and Guernica for years before COVID-19 hit, but the pandemic prompted a closer look at how viruses have shaped our lives.\n&#8220;I needed to share what it felt like to live through this moment, this time of overlapping pandemics, as a queer scientist,&#8221; says Osmundson. &#8220;Scientists have feelings too—we are human, we live through the very things we study, and I wanted that complexity and emotionality to exist in a book full of science writing.&#8221;\nThe result is Virology: Essays for the Living, the Dead, and the Small Things in Between (W. W. Norton, 2022) a collection of Osmundson&#8217;s reflections on the personal, political, and scientific impact of viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, which became even more relevant in recent months.\nJust as Virology was published in spring 2022, the US found itself facing yet another viral outbreak. Cases of monkeypox—a type of orthopoxvirus closely related to smallpox—have grown, predominantly affecting queer men and their sexual networks with painful rashes and flu-like symptoms.\nIn recent weeks, New York City and State, the White House, and the World Health Organization (WHO) have all declared monkeypox a public health emergency.\nHere, Osmundson talks about the lessons we&#8217;ve learned from HIV and COVID-19, and how to apply them to this new public health challenge:\nThe post Book reflects on &#8216;overlapping pandemics&#8217; appeared first on Futurity.",

Mr Biden and Mr Trump are travelling to battleground states to warn of grievous threats from fellow Americans and to make the case, respectively, that Mr Trump is to blame, or that only he can save the country.&#8221;\n&#8220;Apocalyptic warnings and divisive tactics are Mr Trump’s stock in trade. They are more surprising coming from Mr Biden. That he has felt it necessary to resort to them is yet another sick triumph for Mr Trump over what was once normal in American politics.&#8221;",

European energy ministers and diplomats started jetting across the world and inking energy deals — racing to prepare for a rough winter should Russia choose to cut off its cheap gas in retaliation for Western sanctions,&#8221; the New York Times reports.\n&#8220;Since then, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has fiddled with the gas tap to Europe repeatedly. Through Gazprom, the Kremlin-controlled gas monopoly, Russia has vastly reduced supplies or suspended them for days at a time — until last week, when it announced that it would indefinitely halt flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that supplies Germany, and through it, much of Europe.&#8221;\n&#8220;Yet when the blow finally came, it provoked more ridicule than outrage among European leaders, who say that by now they would expect nothing less from Mr. Putin and that they have accepted that the era of cheap Russian gas is over, unimaginable as that might have seemed just months ago.&#8221;",

        "description": "In the latest roundup of features that the Android team has been working on, Google took to The Keyword to share all the new and fun developments. Some of these we had already covered before on this site as they were either in testing or available already but without an official announcement. Some, however, are brand new even to us and deserve to be shared with the world. So check out all the recent advancements below.\n\n\n\nNearby Share Self Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNearby Share makes it easy and safe to share photos, videos, or even whole folders between Android phones, tablets, and Chromebooks that are close by. With Nearby Share self share, which will be available in the next few weeks, it will be easy to move files between your own devices. From the sharing menu, you will be able to quickly share files between Android devices that are signed into your Google account. Once opted-in, transfers between your own devices will happen automatically, even when your screen is off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedesigned widgets for larger screens\n\n\n\nAndroid 12L recently introduced a new look to Android devices with larger screens as well as drag and drop support in split-screen for Google Workspace apps. In addition, Google is now expanding on tablet productivity features by redesigning the widgets for Google Drive and Keep.\n\n\n\nThe updated Google Drive widget includes an expanded size with buttons to access Docs, Slides, and Sheets directly. The Keep widget also got bigger and has a larger font size to make your lists easier to read and access.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmojify all of the things\n\n\n\nIn keeping with Google&#8217;s recent push to make it easier for its users to express themselves with emojis throughout its apps, the &#8220;Emojify&#8221; features we previously covered are now official. \n\n\n\nGboard now lets you &#8220;emojify&#8221; your messages by tapping on the magic wand &#8211; officially called the &#8220;Emojify button&#8221; &#8211; after filling in your sentence. Once you tap this button, you can select your preferred layout, then send. This feature is currently only available in the Gboard Beta app in English, but it will also be coming to the regular Gboard English app in the next few weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, a ton of new Emoji Kitchen mashups have been added and made available as stickers via Gboard. These mashups let you combine different emojis and mix them into customized stickers or &#8220;recipes.&#8221;&#xA0;You can accomplish this by typing in any two emojis, and Gboard will reveal mashup suggestions you can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Meet live sharing and multi-pinning\n\n\n\nGoogle Meet will be adding live-sharing features so you can instantly co-watch Youtube videos, play a UNO game, and interact with one another via Kahoot! quizzes. The capability extends to up to 100 friends and family members simultaneously and is rolling out to Android phones and tablets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, while in a large group call, you will now be able to pin more than one feed so you can focus on more than one person at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom sound alerts\n\n\n\nGoogle partnered with the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community to develop sound notifications within Live Transcribe and Notifications, which can detect critical household sounds &#8211; such as a fire alarm or a knock at the door &#8211; and notify you on your phone or watch when they occur. These notifications can be through a regular popup on your phone, a flashing light, or a vibration on your watch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, these sound notifications can now be trained to detect whatever you want, like the sound your microwave makes when it&#8217;s done or the buzzing your non-smart dryer makes when it&#8217;s done drying your clothes. Just record it, and your phone or watch will alert you the next time it hears that sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle TV audio descriptions\n\n\n\nAudio Descriptions on Google TV will interpret live visual information so blind and low-vision users never miss a cliffhanger. Now you can search for audio-described movies on Google TV just by tapping the Google Assistant button and saying: &#8220;Search audio description movies.&#8221;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWear OS Keep tile and Bitmoji watch face\n\n\n\nWear OS is gaining a tile for Google Keep that can be used to dictate a note or a checklist quickly. Wear OS tiles are&#xA0;glanceable and easy-to-access app screens usually loaded by swiping left on the interface. These display only the most important content tied to that app and often include buttons to interact with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWear OS is also gaining a new Bitmoji watch face so that you can personalize your watch. Just design your own personal avatar on Snapchat, Bitmoji.com, or the Bitmoji app, and then install the Bitmoji watch face. Once you&#8217;ve sent your personal Bitmoji to your watch, it will change expressions depending on the time of day, the weather, and the physical activity you are doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "link": "https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/09/08/european-central-bank-makes-largestever-interest-rate-hike",
        "description": "The European Central Bank made its largest-ever interest rate increase Thursday, following the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks in a global stampede of rapid rate hikes meant to snuff out the inflation that is squeezing consumers and pushing Europe toward recession.The bank’s governing council raised its key benchmarks by an unprecedented three-quarters of a percentage point for the 19 countries that use the euro currency. The ECB usually moves rates by a quarter-point and had not raised its key bank lending rate by three-quarters of a point since the euro’s launch in 1999.Bank President Christine Lagarde said the ECB would keep hiking rates “over the next several meetings&quot; because “inflation remains far too high and is likely to stay above our target for an extended period.”Lagarde stopped short of predicting a recession, though many economists foresee one at the end of the year and beginning of 2023 as high energy and food prices sap people&#x27;s spending power. The bank&#x27;s assumption is economic output would not fall outright but “stagnate&quot; later this year and early next, she said.The bank&#x27;s jumbo increase is aimed at raising the cost of borrowing for consumers, governments and businesses, which in theory slows spending and investment and cools off soaring consumer prices by reducing the demand for goods.Analysts say it’s also aimed at bolstering the bank’s credibility after it underestimated how long and how severe this outbreak of inflation would be. After reaching a record 9.1 percent in August, inflation may rise into double digits in coming months, economists say.The war in Ukraine has fueled inflation in Europe, with Russia sharply reducing supplies of cheap natural gas used to heat homes, generate electricity and run factories. That has driven up gas prices by 10 times or more.European officials decry the cutbacks as blackmail aimed at pressuring and dividing the European Union over its support for Ukraine. Russia has blamed technical problems and threatened this week to cut off energy supplies completely if the West institutes planned price caps on Moscow’s natural gas and oil.The ECB has lagged other central banks in raising rates. Central banks worldwide have scrambled after being wrong-footed by inflation fed by the war in Ukraine and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which have sent energy prices higher and restricted supplies of parts and raw materials.The sudden campaign to raise interest rates follows years in which borrowing costs and inflation stayed low because of broad trends such as globalization, aging populations and digitalization.Lagarde rejected comparisons, saying that “we’re not trying to mimic any other central bank” and pointing out that the ECB started tightening monetary policy in December, when it decided to phase out its pandemic stimulus through bond purchases.Some economists say the ECB’s interest rate hikes, including a half-point hike at its last meeting in July, could deepen a European recession predicted for the end of this year and the beginning of 2023, caused by higher inflation that has made everything from groceries to utility bills more expensive.Lagarde said a 2022-23 recession would occur only under a “really dark” worst-case scenario where all Russian natural gas is cut off, alternative supplies are not available and governments have to resort to energy rationing.She praised efforts by the EU&#x27;s executive Commission to contain energy prices, such as through electricity market regulation, and noted that while rate hikes send “a strong signal” of the bank&#x27;s commitment to fight inflation, “I cannot reduce the price of energy.”But the bank has reasoned that rate hikes will prevent higher prices from being baked into expectations for wage and price deals and that decisive action now will forestall the need for even bigger hikes if inflation gets ingrained.Europe’s central bank “wants to fight inflation — and wants to be seen as fighting inflation,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank.However, energy prices and government support programs to shield consumers from some of the pain will “have a much bigger impact on inflation and the depth of the looming recession than monetary policy,” he said.Rate hikes often support a currency’s exchange rate — but the euro has been under pressure because of more general fears about recession and economic growth. It has recently fallen under $1, the lowest level in 20 years. The euro slid about a half-cent after the ECB decision, to around 99.5 U.S. cents.The ECB’s benchmark is now 1.25 percent for lending to banks. The Fed’s main benchmark is 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent after several large rate hikes, including two of three-quarters of a point. The Bank of England’s key benchmark is 1.75 percent, and the Bank of Canada raised rates Wednesday by three-quarters of a point, to 3.25 percent.",

        "description": "Prime Video's new sci-fi series The Peripheral is based on William Gibson's novel. \nA young woman struggling to hold it together in small-town America finds herself witness to what may or may not be a murder in the first teaser for The Peripheral, a new Prime Video series based on William Gibson's 2014 novel of the same name.\n(Spoilers for the novel below.)\nThe novel is in many ways vintage Gibson: a bleak, dystopian future world chock-full of big thematic ideas, visionary technology, and its own slang terminology. The reader is plunged into this setting and must acclimate accordingly; Gibson isn't interested in presenting everything to us on a silver platter. But that initial effort pays off as the novel evolves into an action-packed cyberpunk thriller.Read 8 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Photo by Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n    \n\n  You can’t get them much more random than this one. Randomly chosen.\nThe fun part of doing these random D-Backs stories is that, sometimes, I have absolutely no idea who I am writing about and most of the times the stories I encounter after endless searching on the internet are better than I had expected. \nPeople sometimes ask me (actually, they never do, but it sounds better this way for the article) how I get to choose these random players. At times I see an interesting chat, but most of the times I see a name passing by while reading or while searching on the Internet and decide to stick to it or not. In that case it is pretty random.\nHowever, I don’t think I have never chosen someone as randomly as today’s former D-Back, Brad Bergesen, because I just scrolled over an alphabetical list of all D-Backs and thought the name sounded Steven Seagal like and therefore terrific.\nNot randomly chosen.\nBrad Bergesen was quite the prospect when he was drafted in the 4th round by Baltimore in the 2004 draft. A two-way player for Foothill HS in Pleasanton, California (and apparently a team mate of Giants’ Brandon Crawford while there) he was committed as a pitcher to the University of San Diego after giving up just a handful of runs in over more than 40 innings. Scouts praised his command and plus pitches,  with room for more muscle to add some velo to his low 90s fastball. He is ranked in the top 100 of 2004 high school pitchers.\n“Brad is doing all the little things to be successful. The sky’s the limit for him. He’s going to put on another 10 or 15 pounds of muscle. He’s just going to throw harder and harder. Plus he’s got great movement and an excellent changeup. I’ve never coached a better big-game pitcher,” Scavone said. “He wants the ball in big spots, yet he always stays calm. Character-wise he’s never varied.” - Bergesen’s coach at Foothill High in an interview in 2004\nThe Californian signs for a bit over $300,000 with the Orioles. \n“You know, it happened so quick. I had about six teams calling me all at once, and all of a sudden I see my name picked by the Orioles, and that was it. I kind of had an idea that they were interested, but you never know for sure until you’re taken.” - Brad Bergesen on being drafted by the Orioles in the 2004 draft in a 2008 Q&amp;A on the Washington Post\nBut Bergesen soon encounters illness and is hampered that way in his development. He pitches for 3 consecutive seasons at various Class A levels in an effort to build up strenght again.\n“You always hear when you’re a kid that you should take care of your body, eat right and get your rest,” he said. “And when you’re a kid, it goes in one ear and out the other. But that really hit me once I got up here.” - Bergesen in 2007 on getting back from a mononucleosis\nCome 2008 he impresses for the Bowie Baysox in AA and earns the minor league pitcher of the year award in the Orioles farm system. His stock rises a bit, Minor Ball ranks him within the top 20 of Baltimore’s prospects with a C+ grade. He has a fine Spring Training in 2009. The Orioles haven’t forgotten that performance because once one of their starters, Alfredo Simon, hits the IL just a few games into the season, they don’t call up Jake Arrieta or Chris Tillmann, but decide to go with a less heralded prospect: Brad Bergesen will make his MLB debut with Baltimore.\n“Bergesen doesn’t try to overpower hitters, as evidenced by his mere 87 K’s in 165 1/3 innings last season. Instead, he succeeds by mixing his pitches, changing speeds, hitting his spots and trusting his defense. The 6-foot-2, 205 pounder also relies on impeccable control - he issued just 33 walks last season after allowing just 26 free passes in 2007.” - 2009 article in the Washington Post on Brad Bergesen\nBergesen makes his debut on April 22, 2009, in a game against the Chicago White Sox and gives the somewhat sceptic fans a bit more than what they had hoped for: a win.\n“The Orioles knew they were getting a control pitcher when they called up Bergesen. In fact, he was ranked as the pitcher with the best control in the entire system by Baseball America this past year. Thank God someone finally came through. The Orioles have seen their fair share of promising pitching prospects going down in flames in the past years, which has led to speculation that they’re potentially promoting pitchers before they’re ready.” - article on bleacherreport in 2009 on Bergesen’s debut\nIn the following appearances until the end of May Bergesen doesn’t impress that much and his biggest strength seems not much more than providing innings. But in June he somehow switches the button and is able to keep hitters better in check. His pitching performance trends upwards until he takes a comebacker of his shin in a game against the Royals at the end of July. Inspection doesn’t reveal any bone damage but Bergesen isn’t able to return to the mound in the 2009 season and sees the opportunity of a nomination in the Rookie of the year award passing by. \nBergesen returns for the 2010 season, but already from the start of the season something seems off. Despite limiting the walks, he isn’t able to punch enough batters out and MLB hitters are getting better contact on his pitches. In 2011 it is more of the same and in 2012 he doesn’t make the Opening Day roster no more and is assigned to Triple A. In May 2012 the pitcher is designated for assignment for the first time in his career. He makes it through waivers, but the second time the Orioles try to pass him through waivers, a day after being called up, the Diamondbacks bite.\nFrom an Oriole to a Snake.\nThe Diamondbacks claim Brad Bergesen off waivers from the Orioles on July 20 and two days later he is added to the roster while the struggling Bryan Shaw is optioned to AAA.\n“With Josh Collmenter moving back in to the rotation, Arizona seemed to be in need of a long reliever, and Bergesen probably fits that role better than the other available candidates, e.g. Craig Breslow or Mike Zagurski.” -  Jim McLennan in 2012 on the AZSnakePit on Bergesen’s callup\nObviously, not only the long relief profile is interesting, but also the remaining option. Bergesen is shuffled up and down between Reno and Phoenix multiple times during what remains of the 2012 season. He looks to have been the right man at the right time available and is being used to provide innings in, mostly, low leverage situations, with the team most of the times in a hopeless situation and on their way to a loss.\nBergesen performs well in that role, although hardly anyone will remember him for it. He provides almost 30 innings in 19 games, pitching to a respectable 3.64 ERA. Before the year is over, Bergesen is released by the Diamondbacks. \nThe Snake becomes a Dragon and ends up a BlueClaw.\nImmediately after being released (or “sold” as some outlets say) Bergesen signs for the Chunichi Dragons in the Japanese NPB. Still only 27 years old Bergesen pitches a fine, but not spectacular 2013 season. An infected nail limits him to 58 innings in Japan. He becomes a free agent and apparently decides to take the 2014 season off. Or just isn’t able to find a new team.\nPerhaps it was a bit of both and in 2015 he teams up with York Revolution in the Independent Leagues. But soon disaster strucks and the California native needs to undergo TJ surgery. 18 months later he desperately tries to come back and pitches in the independent leagues again and tries his luck in the Venezuelan Winter Leagues, but all without success. After a brief adventure in the 2017-18 LVBP for the Tiburones (Sharks) de La Guaira he decides to call it quits.\nBut Bergesen isn’t without a job or without baseball for long as he is almost immediately offered a job in the Phillies’ organisation to become pitching coach for their Class A affiliate. Four years later, in 2022, he is still with the Phillies, currently pitching coach for the Jersey Shore BlueClaws.\nOnce again, as so often in this series with former players, you can take the man out of baseball, but you actually cannot take the man out of baseball at all.",

It's a powerful system, skillfully handled by cynical and craven creeps.\nAnd on the flip side, their method helps suggest the cure.\nPeople need repeated exposure to solid news and conversation. They need people they can trust to talk to. They need time in a non-threatening situation to process things. They need neighbors and members of community groups who share some passion or some commitment. They need to get together, and they need to stretch out into less obvious groups of neighbors to widen their exposure to the world. They need to live in a more neighborly America, and if they don't live in such a place now they need help building it. Maybe they pick a project that cuts across religious lines, or cultural lines, and they pitch in together, and in the end they've not only built something for their neighborhood but they've also made their picture of the world a little larger.\nWe like our private lives here in the U.S., but the more we narrow our lives, the more vulnerable we are to the psychology and media practices of the worst among us. It's a dead end for our neighborhoods and for the country.\nIt's interesting to notice, though, how often a description of a social problem implies, by contrast, a description of a possible solution.",

It's a powerful system, skillfully handled by cynical and craven creeps.\",\n            \"created\": \"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 15:48:54 GMT\",\n            \"permalink\": \"http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2022/09/07/154654.html?title=onTheFlipSide#a154854\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"And on the flip side, their method helps suggest the cure.\",\n            \"created\": \"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 15:51:54 GMT\",\n            \"permalink\": \"http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2022/09/07/154654.html?title=onTheFlipSide#a155154\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"People need repeated exposure to solid news and conversation.

        "description": "Photo by Marc Andrew Deley/Getty Images\n    \n\n  In case you stumble upon a time portal in a pantry I’m currently re-reading Stephen King’s novel 11/22/63. It remains one of my favorite tomes. If you haven’t had the pleasure, the book tells the tale of Jake Epping—a high school English teacher—who stumbles upon a time portal to 1958 in the pantry of his friend’s restaurant (classic King!). Once the awe of such a discovery abates, a plan is created to remove one Lee Harvey Oswald from the history books—thus ensuring the survival of President John F. Kennedy on that fateful day in Dallas and presumably putting the world on a better course.\n  \n        \n      Texas Schoolbook Depository from my visit in 2015\n  \nThis got me thinking about what I’d undo to put the 2022 Minnesota Twins on a more pleasing path. Here are my top candidates, should I stumble into Al’s Diner anytime soon...\n\nSurreptitiously destroy The Falvine’s (TM) phones so they cannot pull the trigger on the Taylor Rogers-for-Emilio Pagan &amp; Chris Paddack deal. Even as poorly as Rogers has pitched this year (54.2 IP, 81 ERA+), keeping Pagan off the roster may have been an “addition” alone.\nIn the same vein, maybe it would be easier to simply shanghai Pagan right before his epic meltdown torpedoed that late-June series with Guardians.\nNervously monitor Joe Ryan’s close contacts so he doesn’t get COVID-19 in May. Before his convalescence, Ryan looked like a bona fide ace. After? Solid—but maybe not spectacular.\nHead back to 1919 and finance Harry Frazee’s play No No Nanette. As such, the producer has no reason to sell young George Herman Ruth from his side-gig (owner of the Boston Red Sox) and the Yankees never develop into a team that curses the Twins.\n\n  \n        \n      Photo by Diamond Images/Getty Images\n      Put this on Broadway as long as it takes to keep The Babe out of NYC\n  \n\nSimilarly, go to late-2019 or early-2020 and raise enough of a ruckus that Commissioner Rob Manfred is forced to disband the cheating Houston Astros—meaning the Twins likely beat them at least once in ‘22.\nWeasel one’s way onto the Twins’ training staff to make sure Tyler Mahle gets enough shoulder rubs, ice packs, or physical therapy to thwart his “dead arm” before it begins.\n\nNone of those paths would be easy, as a common theme in 11/22/63 is that “the past is obdurate”—it doesn’t want to be changed. Every time Jake tries to shift a big historical event, the universe pushes back with any number of obstacles (flat tires, health issues, etc.) to keep the main timeline intact.\nLet’s put it to a vote...",

After a chance encounter with the photographer John Deakin in Soho, London, in the mid-50s, where he had been documenting jazz, Chapman moved to Paris in 1956 and lived at 9 Rue Gît-le-Cœur, the hotel in the city’s Latin quarter that became known as a favourite destination for Beat writers including William S Burroughs and Gregory Corso.As well as Burroughs, his neighbours included the American writer Harold Norse, and the poet and painter Kay “Kaja” Johnson. During his sojourn at the Left Bank hotel – he was the last guest to leave when the establishment closed its doors in 1963 – Chapman documented street life in Paris, including the food markets of Les Halles, photographs of which were published in the book Vanishing France (1975, with John L Hess).

        "description": "On Aug. 23, Director Rochelle Walensky called for a paradigm shift in the manner the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) do their work.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“In these pandemic moments, we found ourselves having to talk to a broader audience,”&nbsp;she said.&nbsp;“We didn’t have to convince the scientific audience&nbsp;—&nbsp;we had to convince the American people.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis shift is critical if the efforts of the&nbsp;CDC are to fully understand, address and combat the challenges undermining the health of the American people. Moreover, this shift is timely given the near historic&nbsp;drops in life expectancy&nbsp;in the United States reported by the National Center for Health Statistics reported a week after Walensky’s statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLiterature is replete with scientific knowledge on the ways infectious agents, such as viruses, evolve to create disease in humans.&nbsp;Evidence suggests&nbsp;ecological factors, including climate change and deforestation, enable bacteria to transform their genetic structure to the point that such pathogens cause us to become sick when they enter our systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOther novel pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, may have been enabled by&nbsp;zoogenic transfer&nbsp;as humans increasingly interact with infected animals. The&nbsp;virus that causes monkeypox&nbsp;was transferred from rodents to chimpanzees to humans. HIV&nbsp;followed a similar pattern. These biological transfers are common and our ability to contain these diseases in humans has been advanced by the development of medical treatments and of vaccines.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is the good news.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bad news is the spread of infectious diseases is incumbent on human behavior. Risk-inducing health behaviors, such as being unvaccinated or engaging in unprotected sex, are predicated on the social and structural conditions that shape people’s actions and emotions.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf we are to emerge from this likely new era of pandemics without losing millions of more lives, we must continue to develop the biomedical strategies that help us to combat pathogens while forging strategies that address the psychological, social and structural factors that cause humans to infect each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis will require nonbiomedical actions. We must uncouple losing wages for missing work because of illness, we must facilitate childhood vaccinations by easing the burdens on families who must travel long distances to doctors because none are available nearby and we must address the undiagnosed or untreated depression that catalyzes risk-taking with one’s health.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn short, suboptimal work conditions, lack of access to health care and mental health challenges fuel infectious disease.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nImplementing a biopsychosocial paradigm (versus a purely biomedical one) in prevention and care isn’t an innovative concept.&nbsp;Hippocrates, considered the father of Western medicine, recognized treatment and healing were directed by attitude and environmental factors.\n\n\n\nIn 1977, George Engel advanced the notion of a biopsychosocial paradigm,&nbsp;stating, “To provide a basis for understanding the determinants of diseases and arriving at rationale treatments and patterns of health care, a medical model must also take into account the patient, the social context in which he lives and the complementary system devised by society to deal with the disruptive effects of illness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis approach to health care also underscores the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Take two aspirin and call me in the morning” is the ethos that has shaped our responses to the pandemics of the past four decades. For those of us who came of age during the height of AIDS, such rigid, noncreative responses simply aren’t enough. We know activism and psychological health need to sit alongside medicine to address the social inequities that fuel HIV. Dr. Anthony Fauci understood that, too, and joined forces with groups such as ACT UP to ensure the lives of people are considered in our battle against pathogens. \n\n\n\nI have heard too many say the COVID-19 virus has outsmarted us. How is that possible? This virus has no brain, no nervous system and no emotions. It proliferates and infects us because we, as human beings, are making faulty decisions. Many of our leading health institutions ignore that humans serve as vectors of disease, driven by emotions, not by logic and reason.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThose of us in the fields of public health and public health psychology understand and implement these concepts in our work. We recognize racism as a social determinant that leads to heightened health disparities for Black and brown populations. We recognize a vaccine won’t eradicate COVID-19. And we know AIDS continues to take the lives of many underserved populations of color. HIV continues to disproportionately infect young gay men predominantly in states such as&nbsp;Florida, where LGBTQ identities are&nbsp;under siege. No pharmaceutical or medical procedures can combat these social conditions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf we are to control outbreaks, we must focus on people. In doing so, our approaches must marry the biomedical with psychological, behavioral, social and structural. Public health must have equal representation in our decision-making bodies and in the extramurally funded research National Institutes of Health programs that we taxpayers continue to support.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPerry N. Halkitis is dean and Hunterdon Professor of Public Health and Health Equity at the School of Public Health, Rutgers University.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Two national coalitions of minority-led community development financial institution (CDFI) leaders are set to receive $25 million in funding from Bank of America.\n\n\n\nThe National Alliance of Latino CDFI Executives (NALCE) and the African American Alliance of CDFI CEOs (The Alliance) announced the investment on Thursday, as part of the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders (NALCAB) National Conference in Washington.\n\n\n\nBank of America's investment follows an announcement by the bank earlier this month of a program to boost Black and Latino homeownership by offering zero down payment and zero closing cost mortgages in certain communities.\n\n\n\nCDFIs are financial institutions that serve disadvantaged communities that have little or no access to traditional banking.\n\n\n\nThe investment in NALCE and The Alliance is geared toward empowering financial institutions with cultural competency to aid their communities in building wealth.\n\n\n\n“This example of Black and Latino alliances working collaboratively will serve as a model for other coalitions to effectively reach diverse communities of color,” said Marla Bilonick, CEO of NALCAB and chair of NALCE. \n\n\n\n“We are thrilled to partner with NALCAB for this announcement as we further build our partnership. This is a historic investment from Bank of America that recognizes the importance of minority-led CDFIs and advances economic empowerment in their communities,” said Lenwood Long CEO of The Alliance.\n\n\n\nCDFIs are increasingly important in communities without access to traditional banking, and they have a growing impact on the national economy.\n\n\n\n“CDFIs are one of the most impactful vehicles for equitable economic investment in traditionally underinvested communities, yet the very CDFIs that are most qualified to serve our communities struggle to be equitably capitalized. This collaboration demonstrates that opportunities and impact are literally doubled when we work together,” said Bilonick.\n\n\n\nFor instance, a CDFI run by Chicanos Por La Causa, an anti-discrimination group started in the 1960s, was the third-largest lender in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) by dollar volume and the largest lender by number of loans in 2021.\n\n\n\nBank of America has invested more than $2 billion in 250 CDFIs throughout the country.\n\n\n\n“We are working across our company to address important societal priorities, including racial equality and economic opportunity,” said Dan Letendre, CDFI executive at Bank of America. \n\n\n\n“NALCAB and The Alliance member CDFIs are uniquely positioned to understand the issues faced by their communities, and bring to bear the necessary cultural and linguistic skills to serve them,” Letendre added.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiami-Dade school board members on Wednesday rejected a proposal that would have recognized October as LGBTQ+ History Month and incorporate lessons about two landmark LGBTQ+ Supreme Court cases into a U.S. government course for 12th-grade students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal had argued that teaching LGBTQ+ history fosters a more inclusive learning environment for school staff, students and their families.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConservative groups including the Proud Boys and district parents said the proposal sought to “indoctrinate” children and violated a new state education law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiami-Dade school board members Wednesday evening rejected a proposal to recognize October as LGBTQ+ History Month and add lessons about landmark Supreme Court rulings that enshrined LGBTQ+ rights like marriage equality to a 12th grade U.S. government course.\n\n\n\nBoard members on Wednesday voted 8-1 to reject the proposal, with member Lucia Baez Geller, who introduced the measure, casting the sole dissenting vote. The school district celebrated LGBTQ+ History Month last October.\n\n\n\nBaez Geller’s proposal had argued that teaching LGBTQ+ history “fosters a welcoming school climate” where all staff and students and their families are able to live authentically and are “treated with dignity and respect.”\n\n\n\nMembers of the public who backed the measure said during Wednesday’s school board meeting that teaching LGBTQ+ history would help create an affirming environment for queer students, who often feel stigmatized or isolated because of their identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA report issued last year by the LGBTQ+ youth suicide prevention and crisis intervention group The Trevor Project found that LGBTQ+ young people who learned about prominent LGBTQ+ figures or issues in school were far less likely to report a past-year suicide attempt than those who did not.\n\n\n\nOne Miami-Dade Public Schools graduate urged board members on Wednesday to adopt the measure so current students would not feel the same isolation he felt as an LGBTQ+ student years ago.\n\n\n\n“I can tell you as a gay child, I felt completely alone,’’ he said, the Miami Herald reported.\n\n\n\nA petition for the school district to recognize LGBTQ+ History Month in October garnered nearly 800 signatures in the lead-up to Wednesday’s board meeting.\n\n\n\n“In light of the harmful anti-LGBTQ laws passed this year, it is abundantly clear that [the school district] must remain steadfast in supporting and affirming all students,” the petition, organized by the LGBTQ+ nonprofit PRISM FL, stated.\n\n\n\nHundreds of bills targeting LGBTQ+ people have been introduced in state legislatures across the country this year, according to groups including the Human Rights Campaign and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Many of them would restrict how LGBTQ+ issues and identities are talked about in school.\n\n\n\nBaez Geller’s proposal would have also charged the school district’s superintendent with exploring the feasibility of incorporating two landmark Supreme Court decisions – Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage in the U.S., and Bostock v. Clayton County, which found that employers cannot discriminate against their employees based on their sexual orientation or gender identity – into the curriculum of an existing 12th grade U.S. government course.\n\n\n\n“These Supreme Court cases guarantee fundamental constitutional rights, and it is imperative that students have access to a comprehensive view of landmark civil rights cases and suffrage movements in the United States,” the proposal stated.\n\n\n\nBut on Wednesday, a majority of board members of the nation’s fourth-largest school district said otherwise, siding with conservative groups – including members of the Proud Boys – and parents that argued the measure sought to “indoctrinate” schoolchildren.\n\n\n\nSome said the proposal would infringe on the right of parents to teach their children about LGBTQ+ identities and would violate the newly implemented Parental Rights in Education law, which bars public primary school teachers from engaging in classroom instruction related to sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n\n\nThe law, dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” law by its critics, also prevents educators through high school from addressing either concept in a manner that is not “age appropriate” for their students. The legislation does not clearly define what is considered “age appropriate” and what is not.\n\n\n\nBaez Geller on Wednesday said anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric had been used by far-right politicians in Florida to ignite their base during an election year.\n\n\n\n“The anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric is a tool used by some to spread misinformation,” she said, the Miami Herald reported. “This is just plain disinformation.”\n\n\n\nMiami-Dade school board members earlier this summer rejected two previously approved textbooks on reproduction and sexually transmitted diseases.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nParents had argued that the learning materials did not comply with the state’s new education law because they were not “age appropriate” for middle school or high school students.",

        "description": "First lady Jill Biden has selected Vanessa Valdivia, currently communications director for Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), as her new press secretary. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe first lady’s office announced Thursday that Valdivia would replace Michael LaRosa, who departed as press secretary at the end of July. Valdivia is expected to assume the position in the coming weeks, though the first lady’s office did not offer an exact start date.\n\n\n\nValdivia has served as communications director for Padilla since he entered the Senate in 2021, filling the seat vacated by Vice President Harris. She also worked on several presidential and Senate campaigns before that, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential bid.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Vanessa’s combination of strategic communications skills, expertise, and experience, as well as her commitment to public service, will make her a tremendous addition to our team,” the first lady’s communications director, Elizabeth Alexander, said in a statement. “We look forward to welcoming her in the coming weeks.”  \n\n\n\nValdivia is also married to Chris Meagher, a deputy press secretary in the West Wing. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nHer move will fill an important role on the first lady’s communications team that has stood empty since the end of July when LaRosa, a longtime Jill Biden spokesman, left the East Wing for a job at public affairs firm Hamilton Place Strategies. \n\n\n\nOther White House officials praised the announcement Thursday.\n\n\n\n“This is such great news!” tweeted White House director of political strategy and outreach Emmy Ruiz, who noted she has worked with Valdivia in the past. “I can't wait to see her shine in this new role.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe first lady is making a handful of domestic trips in the coming days, including delivering remarks at the Flight 93 National Memorial Observance in Shanksville, Pa., on Sunday to honor the victims killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe West Wing has experienced some churn in the communications shop since Karine Jean-Pierre took over for Jen Psaki as press secretary. White House communications director Kate Bedingfield had initially planned to depart in July but changed her mind and decided to stay on later that month.",

– A Wingstop customer in California claims his DoorDash driver ate all the food he ordered and delivered a bag containing the discarded chicken bones — along with a note of apology, of sorts.\n\n\n\nDamien 'Suede' Sanders, who goes by Funny Mane Suede on social media, first chronicled the strange story on TikTok in mid-August. In the video, he tells his followers he just ordered Wingstop, only to find his wings and fries had already been eaten.\n\n\n\n“My anticipation is the real victim here,” Sanders joked to Nexstar.\n\n\n\nAs seen in his TikTok video, Sanders opened up his delivery order to find an empty fry container, a box containing the discarded chicken bones, and a note — allegedly from the DoorDash driver — providing an explanation.\n\n\n\n“I’m sorry I 8 cho food,” the delivery driver wrote in the note, according to Sanders. “I’m broke n hungry. Consider it like ur payin it 4ward. I’m quitting this lame a-- job n e way. B blessed.”\n\n\n\nThe note was also signed: “Your Door Dash guy.”\n\n\n\nThe customer, Damien 'Suede' Sanders, said he opened his delivery order to find the driver had eaten his wings and fries. (Damien 'Suede' Sanders/@TheSuedeShow on TikTok)\n\n\n\nThe video has since been viewed hundreds of thousands of times since Sanders uploaded it to TikTok on Aug. 17. But the incident is still eating away at him, at least a little.\n\n\n\n\"Do you know what it feels like to have your taste buds throwing a party for lemon pepper [wings], only to be disappointed by a pile of bone marrow?\" Sanders said. \n\n\n\nSanders added that he also felt the driver ate the wings \"disrespectfully,\" seeing as he appeared to leave meat on the contaminated bones — an act he described as a \"travesty.\"\n\n\n\n\"I … grabbed my iPhone to show my TikTok family,\" Sanders said. \"This was so unbelievable to me that I knew the fam wouldn’t be able to digest this either.\"\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat happens when a restaurant goes tip-free?\t\n\n\n\n\nSanders confirmed to Nexstar that he soon called DoorDash and received a refund — along with a credit — after informing them of his chicken-less wings. A representative for DoorDash did not respond to a request for further information on the status of the delivery driver, but confirmed to Nexstar the company is \"looking into\" the incident.\n\n\n\nSanders, meanwhile, harbored no grudge against Wingstop, and even offered to be a commercial spokesperson in a new TikTok video shared this week.\n\n\n\n“The whole family [is] eating it,” he said in the video, which showed several people seated around a table eating Wingstop. “I need some kind of sponsorship … I need to be on somebody’s commercial [or] advertisement. Wingstop marketing team, holler at me.”\n\n\n\nHe noted, however, that he didn’t opt for delivery this time around.\n\n\n\n“I took everybody’s advice this time, went and picked up my own chicken so I don’t get a pile of bones,” Sanders said, glaring into the camera.\n\n\n\nWingstop, meanwhile, is planning a special delivery for Sanders and his family. \"It’s important to Wingstop that we provide the best possible flavor experience,\" a representative told Nexstar.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhy is Ruth’s Chris Steak House called ‘Ruth’s Chris Steak House’?\t\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t the first time a DoorDash driver has been accused of consuming a customer’s order. In March 2019, a family in Stockton, California, captured video of a DoorDash driver taking a sip from the milkshake they ordered for their teenage son before ringing the doorbell.\n\n\n\nDoorDash later confirmed that driver was fired, Nexstar’s KTXL reported.\n\n\n\n“We sincerely regret that this incident fell short of the experience we strive to give our customers every day,” a spokesperson for DoorDash said at the time. “We reached out to this customer immediately after being notified of this event three weeks ago. We have since taken appropriate actions, including deactivating the dasher from our platform for failing to follow and maintain our standards of food safety.”",

        "description": "Royal Albert Hall, LondonBeethoven’s great choral work was vivid and electrifying in this Proms performance, with soloists Lucy Crowe and Giovanni Sala particularly impressiveThe last of the great choral works to be heard at this year’s Proms was Beethoven’s Missa Solemnis, given by more or less the same forces that performed it during the 2014 season. John Eliot Gardiner conducted his Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique and Monteverdi Choir. Lucy Crowe was once again the soprano soloist, and only her fellows – mezzo Ann Hallenberg, tenor Giovanni Sala and bass William Thomas – were effectively new to the proceedings.Gardiner’s interpretation – confrontational, vivid, fierce in its articulation and drama – has long been regarded as a thrilling, if radical alternative to the slow-moving, more reflective approach favoured by some performers, but here there was even greater intensity and immediacy than I remember in 2014. Hearing the work during a time of war in Europe sharpens the impact of its demands for peace and its evocation of militarism as emblematic of man’s rejection of God’s love and grandeur. Gardiner’s extremes of speed and dynamics seemed heightened on this occasion, invested with even greater urgency.Available on BBC Sounds until 10 October. The BBC Proms continue until 10 September.

        "description": "Pittsburgh Pirates catcher Henry Davis who was selected number one overall in the 2021 MLB first year player draft. | Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Pirates’ 2021 first overall draft pick has shown some signs of late in the Minor Leagues, but how close Henry Davis is to coming to Pittsburgh is up for debate. Catcher Henry Davis, the Pirates’ 2021 first overall draft pick, has been making plenty of waves in Pittsburgh’s Minor League system this year. Most recently, Davis was named the 20th hottest prospect in baseball for 2022, after being selected to the All-Star Futures Game as a member of the Double-A affiliate Altoona Curve. The big question on everyone’s mind is when will Davis be assigned to the Pirates to get a taste of Major League ball?\nPittsburgh is seldom ever praised for decisions made by ownership, management, or scouts, but drafting Davis might be the best decision the team has made in the draft in a long time. \nIn the shortened 2020 season, Davis separated himself from the rest of the class as he really started to standout as a sophomore at Louisville. In 14 games he posted a .372 batting average with three homers and 13 RBIs, while also leading the team in an impressive  OPS of 1.179.\nIn his last season at Louisville, Davis recorded impressive numbers for a collegiate catcher. Playing in all 50 games and starting 49 of them, Davis led the team with a .370 batting average with 15 home runs. Defensively, he continued to develop as well as he threw out better than 46 percent of potential base stealers. Davis ended his career with the Cardinals following his junior campaign after being ranked in top 10 of the ACC for batting average, home runs, hits, and RBIs.\nThe Pirates would then select Davis with the first overall pick in the 2021 First Year MLB Draft, and very quickly the organization has seen positive growth in the highly touted prospect.\nOther than a lingering wrist injury that has had him sidelined several times for short stints, Davis has impressed on the field. In his Minor League career, Davis averages .271 at the plate, and has recorded 56 hits, 11 home runs, and 44 RBIs across 59 games played. In addition to that, Davis posts a .989 fielding percentage for his Minor League career, playing relatively mistake free as he continues to develop. \nThe MLB Top 100 Prospects list predicts that Davis will make it to the show in 2024. At this point in time, Davis needs as much time under his belt as a full-time starter for a Minor League team. \nSince his promotion to Double-A affiliate Altoona Curve, his batting average has been down compared to his best days in college and lower leagues. In 2022, he’s hit .364 in Bradenton, .342 in Greensboro, but has slipped all the way to .189 in Altoona while battling injuries. However, few are worried about this slump, as Davis has proven he will hit. \nIn fact, now fully healthy, he’s shown recent signs of busting out of his Altoona doldrums, snagging two singles in his August 30 return from the injured list, while walking four times and getting multiple hits, including a two-run RBI double, over three games on September 1, 3 and 6.  \nThe biggest knock against Davis at this point is the slightly unorthodox batting stance, but it has proven effective. Davis also needs to continue to develop defensively before he’s ready to be a full time starter in the Majors. With that being said, he has one of the strongest arms in his draft class, and continues to put in the work to be an every day Major League catcher. \nIt might not be today, and it probably won’t be tomorrow, but Pirate’s fans and ownership have reason to be excited about prospective catcher Henry Davis. It’d be great to see him have a full healthy season of Double-A ball, and a possible call up late next season when the Pirates are inevitably dead in the water, so look for end of 2023 for some MLB action for the youngster. Davis has high expectations to live up to, but has the skill and the intangibles to do so.",

Through 7 starts his record now stands at 3-4 with a 5.50 ERA.\nVarsho hits 2 homers, Corbin Carroll’s 1st not enough vs. Padres\n“The last two days were tough, but I think we have got enough young guys and enough energy to come to Colorado after an off-day and show what we got,” said Daulton Varsho, who homered twice. “You know, it’s not like we did bad these last two days, like got our butts kicked. We competed. That’s a good team over there. They’ve got a really good lineup and they’ve got really good pitching.”\nCorbin Carroll gets silent treatment after 1st career home run\n\n\nMight be the first, but it sure won't be the last for @corbin_carroll. pic.twitter.com/JZ5AUXj4Wu— Arizona Diamondbacks (@Dbacks) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\nWill D-backs’ deep outfield mix lead to offseason trade?\nTrading from that quartet of outfielders would thin out the Diamondbacks’ outfield depth, quite likely in a significant way, but they do have some other options on the 40-man roster, including the right-handed-hitting Stone Garrett, who’s out to a blistering MLB debut himself after a nice showing in Triple-A. The free-agent market would also present several affordable, short-term options to plug into the outfield mix, and finding a useful complementary outfielder on the open market is quite a bit easier than finding the type of potentially impact arm that a trade of someone like Thomas could bring.\nHowever general manager Mike Hazen and his staff choose to proceed this winter, the play of the team’s young outfielders will give them plenty of options. And with a lot clicking elsewhere on the roster — Arizona is 26-19 since the All-Star break, a .578 winning percentage — the D-backs could be a shrewd offseason move or two away from reasserting themselves in the National League West more quickly than most would anticipate.\nDiamondbacks’ prospect report\n\n\nBlondes just hit the baseball farther.  ‍♂️@BAlexander52   pic.twitter.com/EMpdmFBCpm— Amarillo Sod Poodles (@sodpoodles) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\nBaseball News: \nCub’s Keegan Thompson: Bullpen on tap\nThompson (back) will throw a bullpen session Friday, Tony Andracki of Marquee Sports Network reports.\nThompson threw a live batting practice session Tuesday, and manager David Ross hopes that the right-hander will return to game action at some point in 2022.

Eisenhardt, \nThe Academy of Management Review, \nSept 08, 2022\n\n\n\t\t           \n\t\t           As noted in Quartz, this paper \"would lay the foundation for decades of management research.\" The case study method is employed to use detailed accounts of specific companies in order to develop wider-reaching theories of management. If we view the method strictly from a statistical perspective it's quite weak: the examples are few in number and possibly not widely representative. But it does allow people to work with rich data unsuitable for statistical or even scientific analysis. To my mind, it's a mechanism for stimulation pattern recognition, and its success is based not only on the details of the case but also the investigator's background and experience; this is what helps them identify salient similarities between the cases. And as a teaching tool, to my mind, they perform a similar function, only in reverse, using detailed cases to put students into a series of rich environments where they can develop, tacitly, enough background and experience to get started in the real world.\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

The urgency of those piles threw them off their best intentions.\n\n\n\nThe urgency of piles throws off all of our best laid plans.\n\n\n\nWe have to deal with piles all the time:\n\n\n\nTasks piling up on our todo listsEmails and messages that pile up in our inboxesPapers pile up on our desks, documents pile up on our computer desktopTabs pile up in the browserChores and errands pile up, phone calls we need to make, things that need to be fixed or cleanedClutter piles up all over our homes\n\n\n\nThese piles of tasks, messages, errands, chores … they feel urgent. We can’t seem to ignore them in favor of what’s most important, because they come with an anxiety that makes us want to fix whatever’s calling for our attention the most.\n\n\n\nSometimes we ignore the urgent piles, but that doesn’t make the feeling of urgency or anxiety go away … it only makes it worse. It’s like trying to bury our heads in the sand and pretend the problem isn’t there — it’s still calling to us, but we put our fingers in our ears and hum loudly in hopes of drowning out the urgency of piles.\n\n\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with this tendency to want to either tackle the piles or ignore them. There’s nothing wrong with the urgency or anxiety of these piles. But what if we could create a new relationship to them?\n\n\n\nWhat if the piles are opportunities to serve, to love, to play? Would we feel less anxious and urgent about these opportunities to play? The piles don’t have to say anything about our adequacy or inadequacy … they’re just playgrounds.\n\n\n\nOr they could be seen as a garden — we want to tend to these little sprouts with care, but they aren’t a forest fire that we need to urgently deal with.

        "description": "Kirthmon F. Dozier / USA TODAY NETWORK\n    \n\n  The circumstances are difficult, and downright weird in several respects, but the Tigers do appear to have plenty of good options. Having lost confidence that former general manager Al Avila would build a winner way back in 2017, there was no pleasure in finally seeing Chris Ilitch fire him after a half decade that was largely wasted, only frustration that it took so long. From August 2015 when he took over, right up until AJ Hinch was hired as manager in November of 2020, the Tigers remained well behind the curve in attempting to stockpile young talent and build another winning team. The past two years finally saw some of the organizational flaws get addressed, but in the end it was all too little, too late to save Avila’s job.\nNow, Ilitch faces the most crucial of decisions as he, Hinch, and Vice-President of Player Development, Ryan Garko, search for a general manager who can turn around a club that started to make progress in 2021 and then completely blew a tire trying to take the Tigers to the next level this season. Whether it is actually Ilitch leading the search is highly debated. \nReports have emerged since Avila’s ouster indicating that he was on thin ice this season all along, and fans are right to be somewhat horrified that Ilitch allowed a GM whose decision-making was so suspect that the team’s manager and Vice-President of Baseball Operations had to be involved in some kind of triumvirate to sign off on any major decisions, to stay in charge of the organization. A trade deadline with a lame duck GM went about as well as one would expect under those conditions, as the Tigers flipped a pair of players heading for free agency for very little in return and called it good. \nThese are pretty extraordinary circumstances under which to be hiring a new general manager. The team manager and player development chief are going nowhere, and in fact will be the two key advisors to Ilitch in interviewing and selecting a new GM. That is pretty unique for a GM search to begin with, let alone the knowledge that their positions in the organization appear secure regardless of what the next Tigers’ general manager would prefer. Apart from circumstances in which a team promotes a high-ranking front office department head to general manager, typically a new GM is not required to keep the team’s manager and player development staff intact. Hiring and evaluating those personnel is a big part of the general manager’s role. \nHere, things are reversed. In general, most would have to agree that Hinch and Garko are probably better qualified than Ilitch to be making these decisions, so I won’t argue that they shouldn’t be involved. Still, Garko has done very little in his career to qualify him to select a GM, and Hinch had the benefit of one of the elite organizations in the game in Houston, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he knows how to build a great front office either. At very least it has to be emphasized how peculiar this arrangement is compared with most organizations in the league. Two of the top people in the organization choosing their own boss is a situation full of potential for failure.\nWe’ve argued since Hinch was hired that he would have a lot more influence throughout the organization than is typical for a manager, and that has certainly played out over the past year. The reshaping of the front office in September 2021 had Hinch’s hands all over it, and so far the returns from those decisions, particularly hiring Garko to replace Dave Littlefield as the VP of Player Development over the farm system, appear to be going well. Any lingering doubts from some about Hinch’s influence within the organization and with Chris Ilitch were finally swept aside when he and Chris Ilitch appeared together to speak on behalf of the organization when Avila was fired. \n Whether any of that has a real impact on the interest level from top executives around the league remains to be seen. As had been said before, there are only 30 general manager positions in the game. Passing on the opportunity once may well be giving up on the possibility entirely, no matter a prospective candidate’s abilities and reputation. \nHowever, it’s hard not to think that executives with ties to Hinch, or at least to the Los Angeles Dodgers coaching lineage, may be favored considering Hinch and Garko’s apparent role in making the decision. That may sound good on the surface, but Ilitch’s comments that the Tigers would “cast a wide net” may seem like a steaming load of malarkey if they hire Josh Byrnes to get the band back together, for example. It doesn’t mean that wouldn’t be a good idea. Just that it doesn’t fit the lofty promises Ilitch made about an exhaustive search for innovative leadership.\nJob Requirements\nIdentifying the optimum candidate as next Tigers’ GM is extremely difficult from outside the game. Easy enough to point to any Vice-President or department head with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Houston Astros, Atlanta Braves, Tampa Bay Rays or a few other top organizations and figure, hey they can’t do any worse than the Tigers have over the past seven seasons, but it isn’t that simple. \nSome executives who are great on the baseball side, may not have the personality to lead the whole organization, to make deals, to hire, delegate, and, when necessary, fire people who aren’t effective in their roles. The general manager’s role demands both all the baseball knowledge required, and hopefully a specialty in scouting or player development, along with all the executive, administrative, and public relations skills needed to run a modern baseball club, which is a far bigger, more complex job than it was even 10 years ago. There are a lot of resumes that scream future GM out there, but the interpersonal, leadership, and administrative skills required are impossible to infer in most baseball executives, as they’re rarely in the public eye.\nThe simplest solution is to try and poach someone who has already operated well in the role. Hence the popularity of ideas like trying to lure Theo Epstein back into the GM role, or to hire away Erik Neander from the Tampa Bay Rays, or Brandon Gomes from the Los Angeles Dodgers. Neither of those seem like particularly likely possibilities, but we certainly wouldn’t quibble with either. \nAll of which is another way of saying that it’s beyond us to know exactly who the Tigers should select. We’ll touch on a few of our wish list candidates, but also review some of the possibilities that seem to have the most traction.\nMike Fast\nThe resume here is impeccable in terms of experience and innovation, but this one may be a little too radical for the Tigers. If you’re concern is with creating a cutting edge organization rather than always trying to play catch up, Fast is likely the the man for the job. He’s probably my personal favorite candidate, but perhaps doesn’t have as broad a range of experiences as some of the other names we’ll touch on.\nHe began his career in product engineering for top microchip makers NVIDIA and AMD before moving into baseball as an analyst for the Houston Astros from 2012-2015. Distinguishing himself as a strong baseball mind, Fast became the Astros’ Director of Research and Development in perhaps the most innovative organization in baseball. In that role he was responsible for the analytics group and in translating their work into actionable baseball knowledge. He was hired by the Atlanta Braves as a Special Assistant to GM Alex Anthropoulos after the 2018 season. He held that role he was named the Braves’ Vice-President of Player Development in March 2021\nI don’t think there’s any question that Mike Fast would be a huge asset to the Detroit Tigers in any position. As GM, the ability to evaluate and improve players with all the analytic and tech tools available, while also working at the cutting edge to develop new ones and stay ahead of the curve, would be a huge asset in every part of the role, from drafting, development, free agent signings, and trades. After watching the Tigers fall further behind the elite organizations in several areas even as they seemed to be making improvements of their own, the idea of hiring Mike Fast seems like a great way to rapidly close the knowledge gap and potentially forge ahead of most teams.\nLike all these candidates, there are elements of this that we can’t really evaluate at all from afar. Fast doesn’t have a lengthy background in scouting like some other potential candidates. Is that a weakness? Is he a good communicator? A good leader? A good deal-maker? There are just so many elements to running a modern team that have to be explored by Ilitch and his advisory committee with all potential candidates. That said, it would be very nice if the Tigers knew what Mike Fast knows.\nAt very least, Fast is someone who needs to be interviewed, and his ties to A.J. Hinch via the Houston Astros makes for a connection that could earn him the inside track here.\nJosh Byrnes\nAnother popular theory has been the idea that Hinch would go back to the well and re-ignite his original manager-GM partnership by advising the hire of Senior Vice-President of Baseball Operations for the Dodgers, Josh Byrnes. Byrnes was the GM of the Arizona Diamondbacks from 2006-2010, hiring Hinch midway through the 2009 season as manager despite his player development and front office background. Of course, Hinch was also a former major league catcher, a pedigree that often leads to a manager’s seat, but even so, it was a bit controversial at the time. \nByrnes was replaced by a perhaps impatient ownership after the 2010 season, but the Diamondbacks did go on to win the NL West the next year with most of the same players. In his time there he drafted Max Scherzer, Paul Goldschmidt, and AJ Pollock, among others. He took over another low payroll club in the San Diego Padres in 2011 and again drafted some great players, including Trea Turner and Max Fried. His record as GM is of course tainted by the fact that he dealt both Scherzer and Turner before they became Scherzer and Turner, and his tenure with the Padres ended after the 2014 season. He was hired by Andrew Friedman as Friedman left Tampa to take over the Dodgers, and has been a fixture as one of his lieutenants ever since. \nIt would be difficult to argue against Byrnes’ resume, but it is a little concerning that he hasn’t been a GM for nearly a decade. Still, the ties to Hinch certainly argue in his favor as a likely candidate, and getting a top executive who has played a major role in the Dodgers drafting and player development over the last eight years sounds pretty good to us. \nIt would be best if they landed someone who can be completely objective about Hinch and Garko’s performance in the years to come. That may come less easily for Byrnes than for others on the list. He was among the first names we mentioned as a replacement in the days after Avila was fired, but the fact that he was an obvious fit doesn’t make him an ideal one. Still there’s no doubt he has the experience, and whatever his flaws as a GM previously, he’s spent eight seasons under Andrew Friedman as they built an absolute juggernaut of scouting and player development in Los Angeles.\n\nDana Brown\nAnother very popular candidate here at BYB is the other Vice-President for the Atlanta Braves, Dana Brown. As you can see, Alex Anthropolous makes a point of hiring top people as his key lieutenants. Brown is currently the VP of Scouting, a position he has held since 2019, and his track record speaks for itself as the Braves have continued to stockpile talent despite picking way down in the draft for years, and have made quite a few well regarded trades in this timeframe as well. \nBrown was drafted out of Seton Hall by the Philadelphia Phillies but during his minor league career was asked to switch from playing to coaching hitters at age 25, making him one of the youngest minor league coaches in the game. He moved into scouting with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1994, and made a big name for himself in the scouting world, eventually getting hired as Director of Scouting for the Montreal Expos through their transition to the Washington Nationals, during which time he was responsible for drafting players like Stephen Strasburg, Ryan Zimmerman, Ian Desmond, Jordan Zimmerman, among others.\nIn 2009, current Braves’ GM, Alex Anthropoulos, was hired as GM of the Toronto Blue Jays, and one of his first moves was to hire Brown away from Washington as his own scouting director. In that role, Brown rebuilt the Blue Jays scouting department during the years in which they drafted guys like Noah Syndergaard and Marcus Stroman. He then moved into a Special Assistant role Anthropolous created for him where he was involved in player evaluation at all levels, including advising the GM on trades. \nThat relationship has stayed a close one, and was rekindled in Atlanta when Anthopolous took over after former GM John Coppolella’s lifetime ban from the sport for systemic amateur signings rules violations. After sorting out the Braves scouting department in the wake of that mess, Anthopoulous hired Brown to be his VP of Scouting.\nQuite obviously Brown is a keen judge of talent, and has a lot of experience in player evaluation and in deal-making as Anthopolous’ right-hand man over the years. How well versed he is in player development or in terms of innovating with data and technology is a lot harder to parse, as are his executive skills we’ve already touched on elsewhere in terms of running a decently sized organization in a high pressure industry. \nPresumably Brown wouldn’t be where he is without knowledge and skills in all those fields, and he’s been regarded as a potential GM candidate for a few years now. The Tigers already have their VP of Player Development in place, and with a five-year deal and a seat at the table picking the new Tigers GM, Garko probably isn’t going anywhere. So perhaps some of those questions don’t matter so much in this case. \nHiring a general manager who is an excellent talent evaluator at both the amateur and pro levels, with now decades of experience working in the front office for several good organizations, seems like a pretty good idea to us. Drafting more effectively and doing a better job evaluating pro players to make good trades are the two ingredients sorely needed, assuming Hinch and Garko do their jobs well. From that perspective Dana Brown may fit the bill perfectly. \nThere doesn’t appear to be any Hinch or Garko connections here, but that hopefully doesn’t matter that much. They should be casting a wide net for the best possible candidate, and Brown is well known as a popular candidate for a future GM position for a while now.\nRandy Flores\nThe current St. Louis Cardinals Director of Scouting may fit the bill for the Tigers’ general manager opening. In that role he’s been adept at blending traditional scouting with data and video analysis to try and utilize the best of both worlds. \nFlores, 45 years old, is a former reliever and part of the 2006 World Series champion Cardinals squad. When his eight-year playing career ended, he founded his own video scouting service, which developed a good reputation and helped lead him to the Cardinals front office. Cardinals GM John Mozeliak hired him into his current role back in 2015. In 2018, he was promoted to Assistant General Manager, continuing to oversee the pro and amateur scouting for the organization. Flores was apparently under serious consideration for GM of the New York Mets during their last hiring search, before former Angels GM, Billy Eppler, got the position.\nThe Tigers appear to have player development locked down under Garko. Finding a GM with the specific expertise to improve the scouting department would be a strong compliment. Indeed the Tigers have specifically cited improving their scouting, particularly in the international market, as a key skillset they’d like to add on top of all the general requirements of the general manager’s role. On top of his experience, Flores has a Masters degree in Postsecondary Administration from USC, making it likely he’s well prepared to handle running an organization of his own.\nMatt Slater\nSlater was a good ways down my list, but as Lynn Henning mentioned him as a top possibility in his recent column, we’ll give him a mention along with Flores. His qualifications are strong as well, so perhaps if the Tigers go the Cardinals route, Slater is even more likely than Flores. Slater is currently Special Assistant to the GM, Player Procurement for the St. Louis Cardinals, and was previously Director of Player Personnel. \nSlater started in the Brewers organization while still attending Marquette, and eventually moved to the Orioles, and then the Dodgers where he rose up the ranks to scouting director prior to joining the Cardinals way back in 2007.\nHere’s a bit from his page on the Cardinals’ front office directory on their team page with MLB.com.\n“In his current role as senior talent evaluator, Slater works hand in hand with the General Manager in all player acquisitions including Major League, minor league, amateur draft and international talent. Furthermore, he aids in contract negotiations and roster composition. For the past 10 years, Matt has served as a consultant to the Orix Buffaloes Baseball Club of Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball league. In addition, Slater continues to push the Cardinal organization forward in the emerging player procurement markets of Asia and Cuba.”\nIt’s difficult to argue with Slater’s resume. It’s also not a secret that the Tigers have longed liked the idea of modelling themselves on the Cardinals as a consistently strong mid-market organization. Slater and Flores are key architects of their sustainable success over the past decade. Long-time Cardinals GM John Mozeliak hired Slater as soon as he was installed as general manager back in 2007 following the firing of Mozeliak’s mentor and previous long-time Cardinals GM, Walt Jocketty. He’s been at the center of everything for even longer than Flores, and advises Mozeliak directly on every sort of player acquisition. \nThe Cardinals consistently put solid teams on the field, though their recent work is more good than great. They’re still a very good organization, but perhaps not quite an elite one. Some might also question how long Slater has been at the top of the organization without getting hired into a general manager position somewhere. Those are just quibbles, and Slater does fit the bill as someone who would bring a strong outside perspective without being beholden to his manager and player development chief. He also has substantial experience in the international market, both in Latin America and in East Asia, something the Tigers appear to desire, and certainly need.\nPete Putila\nIf you like that Houston Astros pedigree and want someone with fresh ideas, then Pete Putila may be your candidate. The West Virginia grad studied business administration and sports management in college. He landed a spot as a Baseball Operations intern with the Astros in 2011, and has advanced through baseball operations and multiple other roles until taking over the player development department, and ultimately being named Assistant General Manager. That rapid rise obviously coincides with the organization’s decade long run as one of the most advanced organizations in the game, so presumably he did a lot of things right along the way. \nDespite his relative youth, Putila has a pretty diverse resume, working in scouting, baseball operations, and eventually player development. He’s certainly in the mode of a very talented young up-and-comer who presumably knows Hinch very well and might be the ideal person to slot into the GM’s chair between Hinch and Garko and get the Tigers back on track. \n\nSam Menzin\nThe Tigers current interim general manager, Menzin has taken a path similar to Putila to reach his position in the game. Menzin interned with the Tigers out of college, was hired on full-time, and has rapidly risen through the ranks. He was the Tigers’ Director of Baseball Operations before he and Jay Sartori were promoted to Vice-President and Assistant General Manager roles around this time last year. \nBy and large, Menzin appears to have a pretty good reputation despite the results the organization produced under Avila. Along with Sartori, Menzin gets credit for trying to push the Tigers to follow the paths laid by modern organizations, using data, video, and technology integrated into scouting and player development. It’s hard in one sense to evaluate how well they did, as we don’t know the amount of pushback from above. Still, the results haven’t been good on the field. \nWith no offense to Menzin or Sartori, the Tigers already know what they know, and it hasn’t been enough to get the organization turned around. They need to bring in someone from outside with the knowledge found in the top organizations they aspire to emulate. We said the same thing here when they decided to teardown in 2017, and they waited four long years to start bringing in that outside help in the player development department, to disastrous effect. Hiring internally right now just feels conservative and wrong-headed as we watch the ghastly product on the field at the major league level most nights. \nHinch and Garko are staying put, and so can Menzin if they believe he’s an asset to the Tigers in his current role, but the organization needs to step out of its comfort zone here and hire the best candidate possible. Pretty difficult to believe they already have said candidate in-house.",

I’d like to see better tonight.\nLuis Cessa has been mostly a reliever for the Reds this year, but was put in the rotation August 22 and has made three starts since then. The results have been ... okay, I guess. five runs in 11 total innings. He’s working his way up to a higher pitch count, he threw 69 pitches his last time out.\nAgainst the Cubs this year: four relief appearances, 13.50 ERA, 2.700 WHIP, two home runs in 3⅓ innings (Ian Happ, Willson Contreras). Hoping for more long balls by Cubs hitters this afternoon. \n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \nToday’s game is on YouTube.

        "description": "Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images\n    \n\n  He might! They might! Aristides Aquino socked a pair of homers against the Chicago Cubs yesterday, in doing so leading the Cincinnati Reds to a win in the second game of their series in Wrigley. \nLook, we know the Aquino story by now. He’s got the ability to pop up and whack the living soul out of baseballs every now and then, with weeks-long slumber sandwiched around those bursts. But in a season in which winning games has meant absolutely nothing (as it’s absolutely barely happened), it’s at least cool to see the good bursts when they actually happen. If it happens again today, for the record, it could well lead the Reds to a series victory, one that would serve the Chicago Cubs their 80th loss of the 2022 season.\nThe Reds, as things stand prior to the first pitch today, also have 80 losses on their 2022 ledger. Isn’t that special?\n  \n        \n      Photo by: NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images via Getty Images\n  \nAnyway, it’ll be Luis Cessa on the bump again as a starter for the Reds this afternoon, with coverage only over at YouTube for whatever reason. Let’s just hope he keeps his 4.09 ERA since moving into the rotation and not the 7.20 FIP he’s owned in that short spell.\nThe Cubs will start a pitcher, too, I’m sure.

Interim chief Amelia Huffman, who has been with the department since 1994, was not on the list. Minneapolis has hired chiefs from outside the department at least three times in recent decades, including Tony Bouza, from New York City; William McManus, from Dayton, Ohio; and Robert Olson, who had headed police departments in New York and Texas.

        "description": "The federal COVID-19 public health emergency will boost voter turnout for Democrats. That’s the unspoken reality of the Biden administration’s mid-August decision to extend the emergency past the midterm elections. It was a strange move, considering the administration recently loosened key pandemic restrictions, from social distancing to quarantines to testing recommendations for schools and offices. Yet while the pandemic is fading, the emergency keeps a temporary welfare expansion flowing, which is a guaranteed vote-getter and potentially even an election-winner.\n\n\n\nThis conclusion is supported by a poll sponsored by the Opportunity Solutions Project. Conducted by the Center for Excellence in Polling, we asked 2,500 working-class Americans about their voting habits and welfare. Low-income voters who have never been on welfare gave the Republican Party a slight edge on voter affiliation. But when looking at voting decisions, there’s a 30-point swing toward the Democratic candidate for those who receive some form of welfare.\n\n\n\nIn other words, more welfare means more votes for President Biden’s party, which is vying to keep control of the closely divided House and Senate in the midterms.\n\n\n\nThese findings put in perspective the dramatic welfare expansion of the past few years. Medicaid rolls have grown by 24 million people during the pandemic, driven by a federal policy that blocks states from disenrolling ineligible individuals. Similarly, Washington has suspended the most common work requirements for food stamps, contributing to a net increase of more than 4 million recipients. (The Biden administration also unilaterally increased the value of food stamps by 25 percent.) The first two policies will expire with the public health emergency, at which point millions of individuals will begin to leave welfare. That won’t start before the election, though, giving Democrats a boost at the ballot box.\n\n\n\nHow big a boost are we talking about? Potentially in the millions of voters. Based on our findings, for every 100,000 working-class voters who are added to welfare, 30,000 switch their vote from Republican to Democrat. Conversely, for every 100,000 voters who go from welfare to work, 25,000 swing back to Republicans. That means the Democratic Party gets a permanent boost in voter affiliation after expanding welfare, even if that expansion is later repealed. Even so, the obvious incentive is to prevent an expiration, especially before a crucial election.\n\n\n\nThird-party research supports our findings. In 2019, University of Chicago and MIT researchers discovered that a state Medicaid expansion increased voter turnout by 7 percent, 96 percent of which occurred in heavily Democratic counties. And when Democrats’ expanded child tax credit expired earlier this year, a Morning Consult poll found that recipients quickly switched from supporting Democrats to supporting Republicans on the generic ballot. The Biden administration and its allies in Congress fought to prevent that expiration until after the midterms, but fell short in the Senate. Yet the White House doesn’t need Congress’s help to keep millions of people on food stamps and Medicaid.\n\n\n\nThere’s no telling how the greater turnout for Democrats will swing key House and Senate races, though it’s foolish to assume it won’t. What’s clear is that any expected short-term electoral benefit for the left is already doing long-term damage to America. Expanded welfare is directly contributing to soaring inflation, a devastating worker shortage, a massive increase in the national debt, and rapidly growing fiscal pain for states. Most disturbingly, it traps millions of people in welfare, robbing them of their chance at the American Dream. That’s a steep price for an electoral payout.\n\n\n\nGovernment dependency inherently helps Democrats. Yet the independence that comes from rolling back pandemic welfare policies will help America as a whole. It will boost the economy, provide relief from inflation, and prevent the welfare state from spiraling even further out of fiscal control. Americans won’t get that relief until the Biden administration finally ends the public health emergency, hopefully in early 2023.\n\n\n\nThere’s a very real threat that the White House will keep extending the emergency, despite the fading pandemic and the public’s obvious desire to move on. Just as welfare recipients tend to get hooked on taxpayer handouts, Democrats may get hooked on the electoral benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNick Stehle is a visiting fellow at the Opportunity Solutions Project and vice president of communications at the Florida-based &nbsp;Foundation for Government Accountability.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3634045-liberals-push-biden-on-marijuana-reform-ahead-of-midterm-momentum/",
        "description": "Democrats are beginning to pressure President Biden to take on marijuana reform as Congress struggles to find a path forward on decriminalization and as the party contemplates what’s possible before the midterms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLiberals have been building momentum with just two months until the November elections with back-to-back wins on key pieces of Biden’s agenda, from student loans to health care and tax reform.\n\n\n\nWith the wind at their sails, they are now hoping to get the president on their side once again by moving toward what they believe would change the nation’s criminal justice system in a meaningful way.\n\n\n\n“Now that the president has delivered on a progressive policy of student debt relief, he has seen an uptick in the polls, he’s united the base, put Republicans on the defensive and Democrats across the country seem to be riding the wave as well,” said Stacey Walker, an influential Iowa Democrat and former surrogate for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who focused on cannabis reform during the “unity task force” negotiations between the Biden and Sanders camps in 2020. \n\n\n\n“Along with several members of President Biden’s senior leadership team, we all agreed that at the very least the president should decriminalize marijuana and reschedule it through executive action at the federal level,” Walker said of the negotiations following the last presidential election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn the campaign trail, some Democratic candidates are becoming more vocal about the issue, seeking to reignite what they see is not only a moral imperative but a smart political move to maintain their majority.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe loudest call in recent weeks came from Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, one of the most prominent Democrats to publicly urge Biden ahead of a visit to the Keystone State to direct his political will toward reforms where a closely watched race to flip a Senate seat is currently skewing in Fetterman’s favor. \n\n\n\n“It’s long past time that we finally decriminalize marijuana,” said Fetterman, who is comfortably leading against Republican nominee Mehmet Oz. “The president needs to use his executive authority to begin.”\n\n\n\nFetterman was not alone. His request came after a group of Democratic senators sent a letter to the Biden administration ahead of the August recess pushing the president to start addressing the issue. They asked officials at the Department of Justice (DOJ) to remove marijuana from the list of federal controlled substances and pardon those convicted of nonviolent cannabis-related offenses.\n\n\n\n“I think Biden understands the larger issues at play here and I'm encouraged by that,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), one of the Democrats who signed on to the letter, told The Hill on Tuesday. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who also helped lead the letter, stressed, “There is more that we could do.”\n\n\n\nThe lawmakers said the request was a follow-up after receiving a “disappointing” response months prior, claiming the DOJ’s sole reason for not acting was a determination by the Department of Health and Human Services that “cannabis has not been proven in scientific studies to be a safe and effective treatment for any disease or condition.”\n\n\n\nErik Altieri, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, called the rationale “the complete illustration of the government having its head in the sand on this issue.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There's well over 33,000, peer reviewed studies on cannabis for all kinds of ailments,” Altieri said, “and as everyone knows, there is about 36 states in this country that currently have active medical marijuana programs that have thousands and thousands of individuals in them that are benefiting from its therapeutic use.”\n\n\n\nProgressives have also prioritized marijuana decriminalization by framing it as a racial justice issue, as people of color have continued to bear an outsized burden from the nation’s drug policies through the years, especially Black Americans.\n\n\n\nA 2020 report from the American Civil Liberties Union found Black people were more than three times as likely to be arrested for marijuana offenses than their white counterparts in the U.S. That disparity, the report said, has only worsened in dozens of states over a decade, despite both racial groups having similar usage rates.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, as a growing number of states have moved toward legalization or decriminalization in recent years, data shows Black Americans are drastically underrepresented in the country’s booming cannabis industry.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigures crunched in Leafly’s 2021 Jobs Report showed that Black Americans accounted for “only 1.2 percent to 1.7 percent of all cannabis company owners,” despite making up about 12 percent of the country’s population.\n\n\n\nLawmakers and activists have urged Biden to sign reform from the Oval Office, which in their view would further round out what has become a staunchly progressive agenda from the moderate president. They claim the more Biden signs, the more he elevates his standing with the public. \n\n\n\nRecent polling has provided credibility to that argument. Biden’s low approval, which has haunted his presidency for more than a year since the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan, began to change after he signed the Inflation Reduction Act last month. \n\n\n\nHe further bolstered his credentials by putting forth a plan to forgive up to $20,000 in federal student loan relief meant to help low-income young people and other Americans pay off debt for their education.\n\n\n\nBy decriminalizing marijuana, some activists and strategists say Biden would give another potential bump to voters in key swing states, noting that the policy is popular among many constituencies important to Democrats. Any move at the federal level could help inspire turnout among young voters and minority populations and could make a difference in races where the margin of error is tight.\n\n\n\n“He gets a lot of flack from Democrats when he gives a speech on a single issue and they say, man you could have done this months ago,” said Douglas Wilson, a Democratic consultant from North Carolina. \n\n\n\nAltieri, however, cautioned that drug scheduling is usually done through Congress and the process through the executive branch is “not as straightforward” as some Democrats have made it seem.\n\n\n\n“It does involve interagency cooperation that largely will have to come from both the attorney general as well as the Department of Health and the secretary of Health,” Alteri said, before listing a series of steps the agencies would likely have to take to determine if marijuana needs to be descheduled.\n\n\n\n“It's a bit of a lengthy process to go through but, assuming the president put priority on it and he had supportive heads of those agencies, it's something they could do,” he added.\n\n\n\nProponents agree, as marijuana decriminalization efforts have not yet found a place of consensus in Congress.\n\n\n\n“I'd like for Congress to take this up, and I have a bill with others to do that. It's long past time,” Warren told The Hill in July. “But so long as we've got Republicans blocking everything that we try to do, then the administration has an opportunity to step in and give us some much-needed relief.”\n\n\n\nMany activists also recognize that, like the pathway to student loan forgiveness, decriminalization is likely to come from a grassroots-led approach.\n\n\n\nThose who are mobilizing support on the ground see it as a numbers game: The more voices that are amplified in front of Biden, the easier it becomes to influence policy. Even better, some say, is that they have the support of key lawmakers in Congress, whom Biden has regularly expressed a desire to continue working with to enact his agenda. \n\n\n\nAccording to a Pew Research study taken in April, 91 percent of respondents said they believe in legalizing marijuana for medical purposes, with 61 percent saying it should also be approved for recreational use.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile the issue has come up periodically, Biden has been cautious about appearing too enthusiastic about it. He campaigned in 2020 in support of what many progressives are pushing for, including prohibiting anyone from going to jail for recreational use and allowing states to legalize it, but he’s been slow to sign any type of executive action that grants broad federal rules.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLiberals are hoping that will change as the midterms get closer and as the president has momentum coming off of some of their previous hardest-fought policy pushes. \n\n\n\n“We need Biden to take action,” said Moné Holder, senior director of advocacy and programs at Florida Rising. “I don’t see waiting as being an option. I think the time to strike is now. Those who are impacted by it, those who partake in it, whether we want to admit it or not can definitely see this as a gleam of hope.”",

        "description": "A quarter of Americans said they now fear being attacked in their own neighborhood, according to a new poll from NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \n\n\n\nIn breaking the poll down on racial lines, the surveyors found white were less likely to have fears of being attacked near their residences than people of color. \n\n\n\nThe poll, published on Thursday, found that 25 percent of Black respondents said they have fears of being attacked in their own neighborhood, compared to 19 percent of white respondents. \n\n\n\nNPR reported that 26 percent of Latino respondents said they have feared being attacked near their residences, while 36 percent of Native American respondents and 21 percent of Asian respondents shared the same sentiment. \n\n\n\nWhen asked if they view crime as a serious problem in their community, 40 percent of Native American respondents said that crime is a serious neighborhood problem, while 35 percent of Black and Latino respondents in the poll shared concerns about their communities' crime problems.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwenty-eight percent of White respondents also believed that crime is a serious problem in their community, while 22 percent of Asian respondents agreed with the same sentiment, the poll said. \n\n\n\nCrime has been a major topic of discussion over the last few years and is expected to be an issue in this fall's midterm elections, where Republicans have sought to argue that Democrats have not offered sufficient support for police. \n\n\n\nThe NPR poll was conducted from May 16 to June 13 with a total of 4,192 respondents participating in the survey. The poll’s margin of error is 2.8 percentage points.",

        "description": "The Interior Department announced Thursday that it has completed the removal of a slur for Native American women from federal place names after announcing a review in November. \n\n\n\nIn the announcement, the department said the federal Board on Geographic Names has voted on replacement names for more than 600 places that included the slur “squaw.” The department also issued a full map of places where names were replaced. \n\n\n\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to hold the position, announced the review late last year as well as a federal committee to assess the use of slurs and pejoratives in federal place names.\n\n\n\n“I feel a deep obligation to use my platform to ensure that our public lands and waters are accessible and welcoming. That starts with removing racist and derogatory names that have graced federal locations for far too long,” Haaland said in a statement Thursday. \n\n\n\n“I am grateful to the members of the Derogatory Geographic Names Task Force and the Board on Geographic Names for their efforts to prioritize this important work. Together, we are showing why representation matters and charting a path for an inclusive America.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe department’s Derogatory Geographic Names Task Force reviewed more than 1,000 recommendations for new names, considering issues like geographic features that cross tribal, federal and state jurisdictions and contradictory recommendations. In July, the department announced a further review of seven locations considered to be unincorporated populated places.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe review followed similar moves to replace anti-Black and anti-Japanese slurs in place names, as well as earlier laws passed in Maine, Minnesota, Montana and Oregon prohibiting the use of “squaw” in place names.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHaaland has announced a number of initiatives under the Interior umbrella aimed at strengthening federal-tribal relations and addressing Native issues. The department also announced a review last year of federal boarding schools, where hundreds of Native children were forcibly placed.&nbsp;",

        "description": "House Republicans told the Department of Defense that they are “gravely concerned” about President Biden using Marines as “political props” during his Sept. 1 speech in Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nIn a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the lawmakers said it appeared that the Marines “participated in a political event” that “jeopardizes their compliance” with Pentagon regulations against participating in political activities while in uniform.\n\n\n\n“We are gravely concerned that throughout the entirety of this partisan, politically charged, and divisive address to the nation, two United States Marines were visibly present flanking the President in the background,” the lawmakers wrote.\n\n\n\n“The President’s use of active-duty Marines as political props undermines the apolitical nature of our servicemembers and erodes trust in our military,” they continued.\n\n\n\nThe letter was signed by House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), House Armed Services Committee ranking member Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) and House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense ranking member Ken Calvert (R-Calf.).\n\n\n\nThe Pentagon referred questions on the use of the Marines to the White House, but said “as with any letter the Secretary receives from lawmakers, his team will reply to the authors of the letter in due time.”\n\n\n\nBiden’s use of the Marines during his speech sparked debate, with many who liked the president's remarks criticizing the positioning of Marines behind him during a speech that was largely seen as political.\n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre later insisted that Biden had the Marines there out of respect for the military and its role in defending democracy.\n\n\n\n“It is not abnormal. It is actually normal for presidents from either side of the aisle to give speeches in front of members of the military,” she added. “It is not an unusual sight or is not an unusual event to have happen.”\n\n\n\nPentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder declined to comment on the use of the Marines during Biden’s speech on Tuesday, referring to comments made by Jean-Pierre last week.\n\n\n\nIn their letter, the lawmakers asked Austin to respond to questions regarding his knowledge of Biden’s use of the Marines during the speech.\n\n\n\nThey asked if anyone in the Defense Department knew of the contents of Biden’s speech before he gave it, if the agency knew that two active-duty service members would be involved and what guidance was given to the White House regarding their participation in the event, among other things.\n\n\n\n“You’ve expressed your concern about politicization of the military and have insisted the military will not become a political instrument under your watch. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened with the participation of the Marines at this political event,” the lawmakers wrote.",

        "description": "The United States intends to send another $2 billion in military support to Ukraine and 18 nearby countries at risk of Russian attack, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Thursday during a visit to Kyiv.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin also on Thursday announced another package of weapons to Ukraine worth up to $675 million, a pledge made as he met with allies working to keep Ukraine equipped “over the long haul\" amid the Russian invasion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Yesterday, President Biden approved the latest tranche of U.S. assistance to Ukraine. It’s valued at up to $675 million,” Austin told reporters following a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. \n\n\n\nA list later released by the Pentagon detailed the contents of the package, which includes four 105mm Howitzers and 36,000 accompanying artillery rounds, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), additional High-speed Anti-radiation missiles (HARM), 100 Humvees, 50 armored ambulances, anti-tank systems, small arms and more.  \n\n\n\nBlinken notified Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of the latest U.S. lethal aid when the two met Thursday in Ukraine’s capital. It was Blinken’s second visit to Ukraine since Russia first attacked the country on Feb. 24. \n\n\n\nIn a statement, Blinken said he informed Zelensky of the $675 million presidential drawdown, noting that President Biden “has been clear we will support the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. I reiterated this message to President Zelenskyy and his team today in Kyiv, which remains — and will remain — the capital of a sovereign, independent Ukraine.” \n\n\n\nThe new aid would push the U.S. security assistance commitment to Ukraine past the $15 billion mark since August 2021, and more than $14.5 billion since the Russia invasion began. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth the Pentagon and State Department also announced that the Biden&nbsp;administration has informed Congress of its “intent to make a further $2.2 billion available in long-term investments under Foreign Military Financing to bolster the security of Ukraine and 18 of its neighbors; including many of our NATO Allies, as well as other regional security partners potentially at risk of future Russian aggression.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRoughly half of that money will go toward Ukrainian security and the other half split between&nbsp;Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs Blinken visited Kyiv, Austin met with representatives from around 50 countries at the fifth gathering of the Ukraine Contact Group, a group that first met in April to coordinate the flow of military assistance to Ukraine. Those in attendance included NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Ukrainian forces have begun their counteroffensive in the south of their country. And they are integrating the capabilities that we all have provided to help themselves to fight and reclaim their sovereign territory,” Austin said earlier on Thursday as he sat down with the group.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Today, this Contact Group needs to position itself to sustain Ukraine’s brave defenders for the long haul. And that means a continued and determined flow of capability now,” he continued. “And it means renewing and deepening our resolve to stand by Ukraine — with support and strength that doesn’t hinge on any one particular battle.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAustin added that NATO and the United States are working to host a special session in the next few weeks that will bring together senior national armaments directors from the 50 countries in the contact group.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“They will discuss how our defense industrial bases can best equip Ukraine's future forces with the capabilities that they need,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUkrainian forces are working to push Russian troops from the northeast part of the country around Kharkiv and in the south near Kherson, with Zelensky on Wednesday&nbsp;highlighting “good news”&nbsp;about recapturing unnamed&nbsp;settlements from the Kharkiv region.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Russia is showing no sign of backing down, with President&nbsp;Vladimir Putin&nbsp;on&nbsp;Wednesday defiantly claiming&nbsp;his country has “not lost a thing” from the war in Ukraine and the tight sanctions it has triggered.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nU.S. officials, meanwhile, estimated in August that Russia has suffered around 70,000 to 80,000 casualties in under six months.  \n\n\n\nThis story was updated at 12:57 p.m.",

        "description": "Republican State Rep. Todd Stephens doesn’t want voters to know about his anti-choice record. In fact, he is so desperate to hide his record that he sent his Democratic challenger Melissa Cerrato a cease and desist letter to effectively “shush” her from raising her voice and speaking out.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe will not be silenced.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“In this moment, in a world post-Dobbs, we need legislators in the statehouse who we can trust with our lives and our livelihoods,” said Cerrato, who is looking to represent PA’s 151st District.\n\n\n\n\nLast week, my Republican opponent threatened to sue me because I spoke out on his record on abortion. Thank you for giving us our best fundraising week on record—since last Monday, we have raised over $60,000. We will not be silenced. #flipthe151 https://t.co/hVAGoOyG8Q pic.twitter.com/j7Pupqv4Rx&mdash; Melissa Cerrato for PA (@Missy4PA) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\nThis is Cerrato’s first run for public office. However, she&#8217;s not entirely new to politics. As district director for Representative Liz Hanbidge (D-PA 61), she saw up close what effective constituent representation and genuine public service actually look like. And Melissa, or Missy as she’s frequently called – is resolute in her goal to represent people from all walks of life.\n\n\n\nRepublican incumbent Stephens currently holds the seat has over the course of the last 12 years flip-flopped on at least one very important issue: a woman’s right to choose.\n\n\n\nEarly on in Stephens’ political career he argued that some believed he was not a strong enough advocate for the pro-life movement. In 2015, during his run for state attorney general, Politics PA quoted Stephens as saying:\n\n\n\n“In fact, I have voted in favor of every pro-life bill that has come before me since becoming a member of the House of Representatives. I have also voted against many pro-abortion amendments supported by Planned Parenthood.”\n\n\n\nDigging in further, Stephens stated:\n\n\n\n“My record is clear – I have stood with the unborn on every pro-life bill that has come before me since I was elected to the House. That is an indisputable fact.”\n\n\n\nSince Roe v. Wade was overturned, GOP led state legislatures across the country have passed draconian laws that force women to carry to term all pregnancies, with no exceptions for rape, incest or situations that place the life of the mother in danger.\n\n\n\nMany perceive these strict anti-abortion laws as a stepping stone to more severe violations of a woman’s civil rights, including access to birth control.\n\n\n\nTo say these GOP imposed measures have sparked a fire – rekindling renewed interest to vote in the upcoming midterm election – would be an understatement; it’s an inferno.\n\n\n\n“This year, there is no room for ‘maybe’ when it comes to protecting our rights,” Cerrato said. “I stepped up to fight for this seat, not because I ever wanted to be a politician, but because what will happen at the state level this year is too important to let the GOP remain in power.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nThanks @PPAdvocatesPA for recognizing the importance of this moment. And for the backup 💁‍♀️👏 #missy4pa #bansoffourbodies #flipthe151 pic.twitter.com/rAxvwz1OaO&mdash; Melissa Cerrato for PA (@Missy4PA) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\n\nThe startling, yet predictable, backlash from women and men across the nation, who believe the government has no right to interfere in their personal lives, has divided Pennsylvania into two very distinct camps. Further, it has diminished the ability of some politicians within the Republican Party to pose as “moderates,” including Todd Stephens.\n\n\n\nAbortion is still legal in Pennsylvania, but that might change. The PA-GOP-led legislature forced the passage of SB106 late in the evening, just before adjourning for the summer, to prohibit abortion through constitutional amendment.\n\n\n\nA handful of Republicans, including Stephens, voted against the measure.\n\n\n\nThe PA-GOP has attempted slick legislative maneuvers – both subtle and blatant &#8211; in recent years, forcing special interest groups and constituents to more closely scrutinize proposed laws, including HB1095, which would change the state&#8217;s criminal code.\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Pennsylvania issued a statement about the legislation:\n\n\n\n“House Bill 1095 would add ‘third degree murder of an unborn child’ under Title 18 to the predicate list of crimes that would carry a mandatory life sentence in Pennsylvania under 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9715. Title 18 of the Pennsylvania code explicitly exempts abortion from the acts that may be subject to liability as [an] act constituting murder of an unborn child. Nevertheless, the inclusion of this act in Title 42 would set a dangerous precedent that would further blur the line of “fetal personhood” and potentially threaten pregnant people with investigation and criminalization.”\n\n\n\nStephens had previously earned Planned Parenthood&#8217;s endorsement, but not this year. Cerrato has received their support, and she has made it clear that Stephens voted for HB1095.\n\n\n\n“My opponent has been on both sides of the access to abortion issue – I truly don&#8217;t know where he stands anymore. This year, there is no room for ‘maybe’ when it comes to protecting our rights,” she said.\n\n\n\nCerrato&#8217;s reference to Stephens&#8217; favorable vote for the law irritated Stephens. Instead of engaging in a conversation with his opponent, Stephens made his views plain by having his legal counsel submit a cease and desist demand claiming defamation.\n\n\n\nRecently, Bucks and Montgomery counties have seen their fair share of litigation involving defamatory claims relating to political matters.\n\n\n\nPennsylvania’s First Congressional Democratic candidate Ashley Ehasz, is currently embroiled in litigation brought by Jim Worthington of the Newtown Athletic Club. Worthington is also suing MoveOn, a progressive public policy advocacy group, along with a local resident. Both lawsuits pertain to the January 06 insurrection.\n\n\n\n\nMy latest @BucksCoBeacon: Local Trump Supporter Targets Democratic Congressional Candidate @ashley_ehasz With &#39;Frivolous Lawsuit&#39; | The People 4 Trump founder &amp; local gym owner Jim Worthington is using a SLAPP for hurt feelings? #BucksCounty #PA01Read: https://t.co/d0noub9AGB pic.twitter.com/t2bWhgtzyF&mdash; Cyril Mychalejko (@cmychalejko) March 25, 2022\n\n\n\n\nClarise Shillinger, who at one time worked for Todd Stephens, and who coordinated the political action committee Keeping Kids in School, is currently suing PA Spotlight, an investigative news organization, for the way they referred to campaign finance funds.\n\n\n\nFirst Amendment attorney Garen Meguerian, who has successfully represented clients entangled in strategic lawsuits against public participation – or SLAPPS – reviewed the cease and desist letter Cerrato received.\n\n\n\n“These kinds of threats have become far too common. Politicians should resolve disputes by winning over their constituents with the strength of their arguments and the merits of their policies, not through their lawyers’ cease and desist letters,” Meguerian said.\n\n\n\nMelissa Cerrato is on a mission and nothing, not even the threat of a lawsuit, is going to stop her.\n\n\n\nSince beginning her campaign, more than 34,000 constituent doors have been knocked, introductions have been made, and meaningful conversations have taken place.\n\n\n\n“I am ready to fight for reproductive justice and women across the Commonwealth, because their lives are on the line. Only then can we hope to build a Pennsylvania that works for all of us,&#8221; Cerrato concluded.\n\n\n\nTo register to vote, check your registration, request a vote by mail or absentee ballot for the Nov. 8 election, click here.",

        "description": "The Economist: &#8220;One thing upon which Joe Biden and Donald Trump agree is that the biggest issue confronting voters in the midterms this November is Donald Trump. The two men are locked in a dark contest, the likes of which no living American has witnessed between a sitting and former president. Mr Biden and Mr Trump are travelling to battleground states to warn of grievous threats from fellow Americans and to make the case, respectively, that Mr Trump is to blame, or that only he can save the country.&#8221;\n&#8220;Apocalyptic warnings and divisive tactics are Mr Trump’s stock in trade. They are more surprising coming from Mr Biden. That he has felt it necessary to resort to them is yet another sick triumph for Mr Trump over what was once normal in American politics.&#8221;",

        "description": "&#8220;Not long after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, another mobilization began. European energy ministers and diplomats started jetting across the world and inking energy deals — racing to prepare for a rough winter should Russia choose to cut off its cheap gas in retaliation for Western sanctions,&#8221; the New York Times reports.\n&#8220;Since then, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has fiddled with the gas tap to Europe repeatedly. Through Gazprom, the Kremlin-controlled gas monopoly, Russia has vastly reduced supplies or suspended them for days at a time — until last week, when it announced that it would indefinitely halt flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that supplies Germany, and through it, much of Europe.&#8221;\n&#8220;Yet when the blow finally came, it provoked more ridicule than outrage among European leaders, who say that by now they would expect nothing less from Mr. Putin and that they have accepted that the era of cheap Russian gas is over, unimaginable as that might have seemed just months ago.&#8221;",

        "link": "https://laughingsquid.com/face-blindness/",
        "description": "In the third episode of a three-part series about living with disabilities, filmmaker James Robinson explores the subject of prosopagnosia, a neurological disorder known more commonly known as &#8220;face blindness&#8221; that Paul Kram lives with on a daily basis. Kram openly discusses how he can recognize someone he&#8217;s clearly met before, relying on certain distinctive features, gait, hair, and voice.  \n\n\n\nI remember voices. There’s accent, pitch and tone. I will look at how they walk. Gait’s like a fingerprint. Older people take shorter steps. Younger people are light on their feet. &#8230;If someone like Paul is struggling to identify you, the key is to provide details.…Reminding them of your connection, even if you were speaking just a few minutes ago, can help spark that aha moment, that instantaneous human bond that is at the root of how we care for each&nbsp;other.\n\n\n\nAs with his previous documentaries in the series, Robinson created a visualization that simulates how people with face blindness see the world.\n\n\n\nWhat people on the face blindness spectrum need is for you and I to understand what they’re experiencing. So let’s do an experiment. For those of us without face blindness, perhaps the best way to understand how Paul looks at a face is to look at these faces upside down. Even though you can see the individual facial features, you might not immediately recognize who these people are —at least, not until we turn them right side up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKram also discusses his passion for glider piloting.  He explains that it&#8217;s not to get away from people but rather to connect with others deliberately.\n\n\n\nUp in the air, what Paul really found was a place where he could connect with others without relying on facial recognition. At 4,500 feet, he disconnects from the tow plane. Unlike airplanes, gliders will circle together in formation. The maneuver requires a hyperawareness of one’s connection to the other pilots. It’s everything that’s missing from an interaction with someone who you can’t recognize. ‘I trust you with my life. That’s a profound connection.’",

There are an additional 140 executive branch nominations and 62 judicial nominations either before the Senate or on their way there.

        "description": "Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  At one point in the season, it looked like Yordan Alvarez would play himself into the AL MVP discussion, considering his performance from Opening Day through July 9 (.306/.405/.653, 26 HR, 197 wRC+). Notice that I didn’t say win — the award is Shohei Ohtani’s to lose, in my opinion — but Alvarez’s numbers as a hitter at least warranted expanding the discussion outside of Ohtani and Aaron Judge. I’m not exaggerating when I state that Alvarez was even a better hitter than Judge, who is now chasing history himself. \nAlvarez’s early season performance was also one of the primary drivers for the Astros’ overall offensive value, as his numbers were partially responsible for the club posting a 116 wRC+ through July 9. Only the Yankees, with a 121 wRC+, posted a higher value than Houston through that date. Unfortunately for Alvarez, his season hasn’t been the same since that date, primarily due to a bout of reoccurring soreness in both hands. Placed on the IL on July 10 initially with right-hand soreness, the 25-year-old slugger would eventually return on July 21 and close out the month on a strong note with a .344/.500/.813 slash line in 44 plate appearances. \nHowever, the month of August and the first week of September were not kind to Alvarez or the Astros offense in general. In his last 111 plate appearances dating back to August 1, Alvarez struggled greatly with a .223/.315/.298 slash line with only five extra-base hits, including one home run. Ground balls, in particular, were an issue for Alvarez as his struggles worsened. \n  \n        \n  \nDuring the middle of this down performance, Alvarez was also held out of the lineup for multiple games to finish August and start of September due to soreness again, this time in his left hand. While it is possible that some of Alvarez’s struggles would’ve occurred regardless of his hands, it is clear that the ongoing issue is the primary driver behind his struggles over the past month or so. Here is a gif on April 23 on a sinker in the zone that Alvarez hit for a fly ball out. \n  \n        \n  \nAnd below is a sinker in the zone that Alvarez hit for a ground ball out on September 7. I don’t have a trained enough eye to notice many of the finer details of batting stance changes, but he doesn’t look quite as comfortable at the plate as he did back in April for obvious reasons, especially as he makes contact. While Alvarez has contended that his hands aren’t an excuse behind his poor performance in the last month, it is understandable why his production has fallen off considering how vital hands are to batting. \n  \n        \n  \nWith a postseason berth along with the division title virtually certain, along with possibly the best record in the AL, the Astros can afford to exercise caution with Alvarez, who is the club’s most dangerous hitter when healthy. With fewer off days in this year’s postseason, it would make sense for Dusty Baker to give Alvarez some extra rest in combination with the time off with a bye in the first round. For what it’s worth, Houston’s offense since Alvarez’s IL stint in July has been uninspiring with a .248/.312/.409 slash line and a 103 wRC+. While the blame for that subpar performance is not exclusively due to Alvarez, the Astros lineup depends more on his production than ever before. His performance in October could ultimately be the difference maker this year, for better or worse.",

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) asked to pull a committee vote on a bill aimed at giving news outlets the ability to negotiate collectively with tech platforms after she said an adopted amendment offered by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) impeded the bipartisan agreement senators reached ahead of the Thursday meeting.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee were slated to vote on a revised version of the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, but Klobuchar asked to hold it after Cruz’s amendment was adopted by a one-vote margin by the Republicans on the committee.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think the agreement that we had has been blown up,” Klobuchar said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a statement, she said she fully plans to move forward with the bill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This bill is about protecting local journalism by leveling the playing field and allowing local news outlets to band together to negotiate for fair compensation from tech platforms. I am committed to targeted, bipartisan legislation to achieve this goal,” she said in the statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe amendment passed in a 11-10 vote. Sen. John Ossoff (D-Ga.), who is isolating in India after testing positive for COVID-19, was not present and did not provide a proxy vote either way on the amendment&nbsp;— giving the GOP senators an upper hand.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe underlying bill would grant newsrooms that employ fewer than 1,500 full-time employees — a cap essentially aimed at excluding the country’s three largest newspapers and national broadcasters — the ability to collectively negotiate with dominant tech platforms, like Google and Facebook, to be compensated for distributing their content.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bill would also create a limited safe harbor from federal and state antitrust laws for eligible digital journalism providers that would allow them to participate in joint negotiations.&nbsp;The antitrust exemption would allow news outlets to collectively negotiate in a way supporters say would help the outlets craft deals with the tech giants.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCruz’s amendment sought to eliminate the antitrust exemption if either side in negotiations mentions content moderation, adding to his ongoing accusations that tech giants are censoring conservative content.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It simply says the topic of discussion when the two sides get together can't be censorship. It should be ad revenue, which is what all of this discussion of this markup has focused on,” Cruz said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKlobuchar said the amendment would essentially give tech platforms a “get out of jail free card.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Since news outlets depend on the antitrust exemption while the covered platforms do not, the platforms could then raise content moderations at the first opportunity in an attempt to avoid the joint negotiations,” she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKlobuchar made a direct plea to Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a sponsor of the bill, not to support the amendment ahead of the vote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Sen. Kennedy, we worked on this for months and we won't be able to support the Cruz amendment here, so I’m hoping we can talk about this in the future. But if this is in it we can't support the bill,” she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKennedy voted with the committee's other GOP members on the amendment.\n\n\n\nCruz said in a statement the outcome of the markup was a “huge victory for the First Amendment and free speech,” and ramped up his accusations of anti-conservative censorship online. \n\n\n\n“[Democrats] would rather pull their bill entirely than advance it with my proposed protections for Americans from unfair online censorship,” Cruz said.\n\n\n\nThe bill also faced pushback from senators on both sides of the aisle before Cruz’s amendment halted the ultimate vote, signaling it may have a rough path forward in the Senate if presented again.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a supporter of other antitrust bills targeting tech giants that Klobuchar has put forward, said he could not support the bill because he views it as being “pro-trust” by shrinking antitrust rules.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) also voiced content moderation concerns, but from the other side of the issue from Cruz. Padilla raised concerns about a provision in the bill that says tech platforms may not “discriminate against any eligible digital journalism provider that is a member of a joint negotiation entity.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTech groups raised similar concerns about the provision ahead of the hearing, arguing it could force platforms to host and fund content even if it is extremist.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKlobuchar remained steadfast in saying that the bill is not about content moderation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bill is facing opposition from a joint force of tech industry and advocacy groups. Twenty-one groups sent a letter to senators on the committee last week urging against advancing the proposal.\n\n\n\nBut the News Media Alliance, a trade association representing newspapers, is advocating for its passage and says it would help the industry survive as tech companies cut into news outlets’ ad revenue.\n\n\n\n— Updated at 1:58 p.m.",

        "description": "Fewer Americans said inflation is their top issue going into November’s midterm elections than in recent months, according to a new poll released on Thursday.\n\n\n\nThirty percent of respondents in the NPR-PBS Newshour-Marist poll listed inflation as their top issue in the upcoming elections — down from 37 percent in July — as inflation showed signs of slowing.\n\n\n\nEven as fewer Americans placed inflation at the top of their list of concerns, it remained the issue most frequently cited as being “top of mind,” ahead of abortion and health care, according to the poll.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, the issue of abortion gained ground on inflation: The portion of respondents listing it as their top election issue rose slightly from 18 percent in July to 22 percent in September, the poll found.\n\n\n\nAfter the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, 61 percent of respondents said the decision made them more likely to vote in November’s elections. This number had decreased slightly by the September poll, with 58 percent saying the decision encouraged them to vote.\n\n\n\nDemocrats also maintained a slight edge over Republicans among the poll’s respondents, with 48 percent saying they would support a Democratic candidate for Congress in November and 44 percent saying they would support a Republican candidate. However, Republicans have narrowed the gap since June, when 41 percent said they would support one of the party’s candidates.\n\n\n\nDemocrats’ expectations for the upcoming elections have improved slightly in recent weeks amid a series of wins for the party, including the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and President Biden’s announcement about student loan debt forgiveness. \n\n\n\nThe NPR-PBS Newshour-Marist poll was conducted from Aug. 29 to Sept. 1 with 1,236 adults and is statistically significant within plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.",

        "description": "Enlarge / The $50 Chromecast with Google TV. It comes in colors.  (credit: Google)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe base-model $30 Chromecast is 4 years old at this point, so it's probably time for an upgrade. The usually reliable WinFuture has gotten wind that a new Chromecast launch should be happening any day, saying that a new device is already landing in dealer inventory systems.\nThe report says that the \"Google G454V,\" which hit the Federal Communications Commission a few months ago, is a 1080p streaming device that runs Google TV. In Europe, the device has a price of \"around 40 euro\" which would slot it in below the existing \"Chromecast with Google TV,\" which is 69.99 euro.\nA new Chromecast makes a ton of sense. Besides being pretty old for a piece of technology, Google upended the Chromecast formula when it launched the high-end, 4K \"Chromecast with Google TV\" in 2020. The Chromecast changed from a dead-simple, zero-interface media receiver to having a full-blown TV OS with a remote control, an app store, and onboard storage. With that big shift came a change in operating systems: \"Google TV\" means it's running Android, while the current entry-level Chromecast runs the cast OS.Read 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Getty Images | Samuel Corum)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelaware Court of Chancery Judge Kathaleen McCormick yesterday slammed Elon Musk for failing to provide text messages sought by Twitter. McCormick cited \"glaring deficiencies\" in the Musk side's document production in an order partially granting Twitter's request for more records, writing:\nPlaintiff's Fourth Discovery Motion identifies clear deficiencies in Defendants' document production. Third parties produced text messages with Musk that Musk himself did not produce, and Musk's own production of text messages revealed glaring deficiencies. As just one example, Defendants produced two texts sent to Musk from Robert Steel of Parella Weinberg Partners on June 17 at 9:57 a.m. and 10:15 a.m. The 9:57 a.m. text asks a question. The 10:15 a.m. text—stating \"Ok. Got it. ...\"—implies that Musk responded. Assuming that Musk's response was not telepathic, one would expect some evidence of it in Defendants' document production. But Defendants provided none by the deadline for substantially completing document discovery.\nMcCormick further wrote that \"Musk's approach to answering interrogatories also left much to be desired.\" After being ordered \"to respond to interrogatories that required Defendants to identify persons with knowledge of relevant facts,\" Musk's side \"supplemented their responses on August 26, but they did a bad job of it, identifying only a handful of people about whom Twitter was already aware.\" Musk later supplemented that by identifying 491 \"people with knowledge\" but could have provided that information \"much earlier,\" the judge wrote.\n\"Defendants have now cured many of the deficiencies about which Plaintiff complained in its Fourth Discovery Motion. They accuse Plaintiff of jumping the gun and seeking sanctions prematurely, but I do not see it that way. I can understand why Plaintiff requires relief. Plaintiff has born[e] the bulk of the burden of discovery.\"Read 14 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

This truth has about as much validity as the one I’m riffing on, but it is if anything more firmly believed. To our great loss.\nThe late Queen Elizabeth II played the hand she was dealt about as well as it could possibly have been played, and this required her to exercise virtues that few of our public figures today even know exist: dutifulness; reliability; silence; dignity; fidelity; devotion to God, family, and nation. We shall not look upon her like again; her death marks the end of a certain world. Its excellences, as well as its shortcomings, are worthy of our remembrance. \nThis may perhaps be a good time to listen to the small but sumptuous motet that Ralph Vaughan Williams composed for the Queen’s coronation: \n ",

Where do they come from? And how do they survive? Peggy Frew asks similar questions of the three sisters at the centre of Wildflowers, an intimate story about the roles we are cast in by our family, and our obligations to them.The Miles Franklin and Stella prize-shortlisted author of Hope Farm has been honing in on questions of identity and familial responsibility for some time now, but in Wildflowers she gets right to the heart of things. Nina is 37 and lives alone, her days defined by a series of increasingly odd routines. She is broken, struggling to find meaning in her life, particularly in the wake of an intensely traumatic trip away, when she and her older sister, Meg, effectively kidnap their younger, wilder sister Amber, in an attempt to force her to stop using drugs. Nina’s present-day apathy bookends the novel, which for the most part is a flashback to that intense, damaging trip to the rainforest of far-north Queensland.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningWildflowers by Peggy Frew is out now, published by Allen &amp; Unwin Continue reading...",

The Yankees’ extremely lackluster August and early-September had Andrew prepared to tackle the brutal task of discussing this team on his own this week with Kunj on vacation, but a four-game winning streak that followed an awful road trip through Oakland, Anaheim, and Tampa Bay at least has the monologue sounding a bit more chipper than it would have otherwise been.\nWith 55 homers through 137 games, Aaron Judge has still been incredible, but he needs some more support in the lineup with so many teammates rendered injured or ineffective — think Giancarlo Stanton, DJ LeMahieu, Anthony Rizzo, etc. Oswaldo Cabrera and Oswald Peraza rebounded from slumps to help the Yankees sweep yesterday’s doubleheader, Isiah Kiner-Falefa has belted a pair of homers, and even Gleyber Torres went deep for just the third time since the beginning of August. That’s promising! But the onus will be on them to keep it going because Judge is not getting any pitches to hit, and it doesn’t sound like there’s much of a cavalry coming to save them. (The pitching will get Nestor Cortes and Luis Severino back soon, but the men on the mound haven’t been the problem.)\nYou can listen to the show on the web player below, or on any of your preferred podcast apps — to name a few, we’re on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, Spotify, PlayerFM, and iHeartRadio.",

        "description": "“Queen Elizabeth II has died, according to Buckingham Palace, setting off an outpouring of grief in Britain for the 96-year-old monarch, who reigned for 70 years,” the New York Times reports.\n\n\n\n“Her last public appearance was on Tuesday, when the queen, smiling and holding a walking stick, greeted Liz Truss, Britain’s new prime minister, in the drawing room at Balmoral. Ms. Truss was the 15th British prime minister to have an audience with the queen upon taking office, a testament to the longevity of Elizabeth, who served for many Britons as a beacon of stability amid political instability, economic crisis, social unrest and war.”",

        "description": "Queen Elizabeth II pictured in 2012.Eddie Mulholland /WPA Pool/Getty ImagesUpdated September 8, 2022 at 3:44 PM ETQueen Elizabeth II, whose seven decades on the throne of the United Kingdom was a longer reign than any other British monarch, has died at the age of 96.The queen &quot;died peacefully&quot; on Thursday afternoon at Balmoral Castle, her estate in the Scottish Highlands, royal family officials announced. Her son Charles, 73, is now king and will be known as King Charles III. Officials said he remains at Balmoral and will return to London on Friday. &quot;The death of my beloved Mother, Her Majesty The Queen, is a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family,&quot; the king said in a statement. &quot;We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished Sovereign and a much-loved Mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.&quot; Camilla, his second wife, will be known as queen consort. Elizabeth had been placed under medical supervision earlier Thursday, officials said. &quot;Following further evaluation this morning, The Queen&#x27;s doctors are concerned for Her Majesty&#x27;s health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision,&quot; the palace had said in a statement. Other members of the royal family had also traveled to Balmoral, including her grandson Prince William, who is now the heir apparent. Prince Harry, who was already in the country for a charity event, was also reportedly en route. World leaders and mourners pay tributeAfter Thursday&#x27;s announcement, a flood of condolences came in from all corners of the globe: world officials, cultural icons and everyday people alike. &quot;Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II embodied the British nation&#x27;s continuity and unity for over 70 years,&quot; said French President Emmanuel Macron. &quot;I remember her as a friend of France, a kind-hearted queen who has left a lasting impression on her country and her century.&quot;Mourners gather at Buckingham Palace after Thursday&#x27;s announcement that Queen Elizabeth II has died.Leon Neal/Getty ImagesAnd outside of Buckingham Palace in London, hundreds of mourners had gathered to lay flowers and pay their respects as a double rainbow arced overhead. In recent years, the queen had taken on fewer public duties, occasionally canceling appearances in which her attendance was once tradition. Mobility issues had troubled her in recent months, and she had taken to spending much of her time at Windsor Castle, the family&#x27;s country estate near London, and at Balmoral, the castle in Scotland. Her husband of more than 73 years, Prince Philip, whom she once described as &quot;my strength and stay all these years,&quot; died in April 2021. In February, she contracted COVID-19, which she later described as leaving her &quot;very tired and exhausted.&quot;In June, Elizabeth appeared at her Platinum Jubilee celebrating her 70 years on the throne, watching the parade from a balcony of Buckingham Palace. But she missed most of the other festivities. And on Tuesday, she met with the U.K.&#x27;s new prime minister, Liz Truss, at Balmoral, a first in her reign. Prime Minister Liz Truss cites a &quot;great loss&quot;Speaking outside 10 Downing Street, Truss called Thursday &quot;a day for great loss.&quot;&quot;With the king&#x27;s family, we mourn the loss of his mother. And as we mourn, we must come together as a people to support him to help him bare the awesome responsibility that he now carries for us all,&quot; she said. &quot;We offer him our loyalty and devotion, just as his mother devoted so much to so many for so long.&quot;Elizabeth acceded to the throne on Feb. 6, 1952. Over her 70-year-long reign, she oversaw an extraordinary period of British history, including decolonization and the independence of more than 20 countries that were once a part of the British Empire. She commanded widespread respect both at home and abroad, though she was criticized after the death of Princess Diana for being out of touch with the public mood. Fifteen British Prime Ministers came and went during her reign, along with 14 U.S. Presidents. By the time she died, most Brits had never known another monarch. &quot;Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was more than a monarch. She defined an era,&quot; said President Biden and the first lady in a statement. &quot;We send our deepest condolences to the Royal Family, who are not only mourning their Queen, but their dear mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. Her legacy will loom large in the pages of British history, and in the story of our world.&quot;  Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "Photo by The Atlanta Braves/MLB via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Skip’s legendary Squirm game turns 30 this week. Something happened 30 years ago this week during a Braves telecast that I still have some questions about. This happened shortly before the internet was really a thing. It was the stuff of legend. I will describe this hilarious event I will see if anyone has a memory of it or can help out. Yeah, and one of those questions is not “do you have worms”.\nIt was a typical late summer Braves game on TBS on September 11, 1992. The Braves were in the process of beating a hapless sub-.500 Astros team to a pulp. Yes, back then the Astros were in the National League, back when a guy that loves his job was calling Atlanta games. The 2022 Braves have a 47-7 record against sub-.500 teams since June 1st. Beating up on the lousy teams during the late stretches of the season was typical then, and this 1992 team was no different. In the third inning, the Braves television team announced the promo for the movie after the game. The movie caption provided was simply a open door with the entire room filled top to bottom with worms. Pete Van Wieren announced the movie would be shown after the game. This odd image went unnoticed and unmentioned by the color man, who was probably Joe Simpson.\nThis movie caption was promoed during every half inning. It continued as the Braves took a 3-0 lead into the middle of the fifth. What happened then was something that occurred during every Braves game during the 1990s. The radio team and the TV team would trade places, meaning Skip Caray and Don Sutton entered the TV booth. It was nice to get all of these great broadcasters into the booth during one game. But it confused some viewers. Skip Caray would tell of a letter he received asking why they only broadcast the first half of the game. When Skip would announce that they were moving over to Braves Radio, the poor soul would turn off the TV and flip on the radio. Another viewer asked where they could get a Braves Radio. Did that actually happen? I can’t confirm. Skip Caray enjoyed a good story.\n  \n        \n  \nSo before that tangent, Skip Caray had stepped into the TV booth in the bottom of the fifth. Sure enough, the promo appeared. The same door frame was filled to the top with night crawlers. “Stay tuned after the game for Squirm on TBS”, said Caray followed by a snide remark. Skip and Don went on the discuss the caption in detail in between pitches. Top of the sixth arrived with more jokes and banter. The bottom of the sixth arrived, but you would never know. The game was mere background to the roasting of this film and its promo. I wish I remembered some of the jokes that were told, but I just could not believe this was happening.\nThen the top of the seventh arrived. There is no “hi”, no “welcome back”, no announcing of the score, the batter, or the pitcher. There was simply dead air. Otis Nixon hits a single. Nothing. Jeff Blauser follows with an another single. Still nothing. The promo appears. Skip Caray announces, “Stay tuned after the game for Squirm on TBS. Watch the movie and write an essay. Mail those to &lt;the address for marketing at TBS&gt;. If we select your essay, we will send you a baseball autographed by every member of the Braves.” After that, the commentary continued. The Braves would score four more times and win a Pete Smith shutout 7-0.\nTed Turner, former owner of the Braves, owned a lot of rights to motion pictures. He purchased many classic movies from the 1930s to 1970s time frame. You may have heard of Turner Classic Movies channel. He purchased those at a cut rate, broadcast them on his superstation turned cable station TBS, and it helped fuel his media empire. Not everyone was pleased that he owned these masterpieces. He colorized many of these movies, which infuriated movie critics and historians. One of those critics was Roger Ebert, who wrote:\nThere is no use trying to convince Turner that colorization is evil - that he is polluting the imaginations of countless young people who will see “Casablanca” for the first time in a colorized version....  Apparently he has never sat in the darkness of a movie theater and felt in his bones the perfection of black and white photography, its absolute appropriateness for stories like “Casablanca.” When Turner was challenged at a press conference some months ago on the issue of colorization, he said he planned to “colorize `Casablanca’ just to p- - - everybody off.”\nHis purchased movies helped sell a lot of ad space, spin off the first 24-hour news channel in CNN, and fuel an empire. I remember a lot of $19.95 Ginzu knife sets and similar items being hawked. One of them was for Time Life Books:\n\nYou see, before the internet, you needed books to fuel your conspiracy theories instead of Twitter and Facebook. (Ummm can we go back?) But the Time Life Books were great. You could learn about all manner of things. The Old West, World War II, and home improvement were popular series. I have benefited from those personally. You could rewire your house or build a deck or tackle any task with their help. You could learn how to fix a toilet while sitting on the toilet.\nSo Skip Caray saw one of Ted Turner’s movies which aided his media rise, and put it on blast. He created a contest out of whole cloth to cover for it. Did it work? It definitely worked on me. (Thanks to research by Darryl Palmer on tracking down the date of this game and other info) I didn’t watch it live. I grabbed a VHS tape and pressed record, as you do in the early 1990s with no DVR.\n  \n        \n  \nUnlike Casablanca, Squirm was not exactly a classic in my estimation. It came off as dated even in the early 1990s. Basically, this movie is similar to the Blob category of movies. Lightning causes power poles to electrocute the ground, causing tons of bloodthirsty worms to run amok in the South. The cinematography was terrible, almost Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Blair Witch level. I’m sorry, but Skip was right. It was craptastic. The VHS tape ran out of room before it ended, mercifully for me.\nAfter watching Squirm, I stared at an empty page. I had no idea what to say about it. I didn’t possess then even the lousy writing skills that I have now. A baseball that was signed by the 1992 Atlanta Braves would have signatures from Hall of Famers Bobby Cox, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, future Braves coach Terry Pendleton, and Sid Bream, David Justice, Javy Lopez, Deion Sanders, Vinny Castilla, Steve Avery, and many others. But I never entered the contest.\nSo after 30 years, I still have a lot of questions:\n\nDo you remember this game?\nDid Ted Turner call the booth and curse out Skip Caray?\nDid you enter the contest and if so, did you win the baseball?\nDo you remember any particular slams that Skip had for this movie?\nHow did Time Life Books change your life?\n\nIn my research, I found that some believe Squirm was shown many times after a Braves game. To my knowledge, this was the only time it was shown after a Braves game. This is definitely the only time they ran a contest. My knowledge goes back to watching practically every game from 1991 to 1996, and most thereafter. Skip did mention it a few times, saying that the essays were way better than the movie. I think Joe Simpson might be able to answer some of these. Please help out, Skip Caray’s legend needs to be told.",

        "description": "Queen Elizabeth II died on Thursday, ending the longest reign of any British head of state.\n\n\n\nHer death set in motion Operation London Bridge, plans that have been put in place since the 1960s and revised regularly over decades. \n\n\n\nDetails about the plan have been revealed over the years shedding light on how the planned 10 days between the queen’s death and her funeral will truly look.\n\n\n\nThe plan specifies the process for announcing the queen's death, the period of official mourning in Britain and other nations tied to the British throne and for her funeral, according to documents seen by Politico last year.\n\n\n\nThe operation involves a variety of institutions, including the Church of England, Metropolitan Police Service, the British Armed Forces, the media, the Royal Parks, London boroughs, the Greater London Authority and Transport for London.\n\n\n\nElizabeth’s private secretary was designated to spread the news of her death, first to the prime minister, according to the report.\n\n\n\nThe call from the secretary to the prime minister would initiate a “call cascade” that informed senior parties of the queen’s death.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister would be the first government official to speak out about the queen’s death, and other officials were told to wait until those comments were delivered, according to the report.\n\n\n\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office’s Global Response Centre would deliver the news to the Commonwealth countries where Elizabeth is queen.\n\n\n\nThe British Parliament, as well as the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish parliaments, would convene for emergency meetings shortly after Elizabeth's death, and the prime minister would address the House of Commons.\n\n\n\nCharles, prince of Wales, would ascend to king in a separate operation called Operation Spring Tide.\n\n\n\nPrince William, duke of Cambridge, would be next in line to the throne, followed by his three children: Prince George of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge and Prince Louis of Cambridge.\n\n\n\nKing Charles would give a speech shortly after the death of his mother and government buildings will lower their flags to half-mast.\n\n\n\n“There are really two things happening,” one of Charles’s advisers told The Guardian in 2017. “There is the demise of a sovereign and then there is the making of a king.”\n\n\n\nThe Accession Council would proclaim the new king the day following the queen's death when they meet at St. James’s Palace, according to reports.\n\n\n\nParliament would swear allegiance to King Charles that evening before parliamentary activities are suspended for 10 days.\n\n\n\nThe Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments would proclaim the new monarch two days after the queen’s death.\n\n\n\nKing Charles would begin a tour of the United Kingdom three days after the queen’s death, visiting Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.\n\n\n\nThe queen’s funeral is expected to be held 10 days after her death, on a Sunday, a time that will be solidified in British history as a National Day of Mourning.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/3634206-the-aboriginal-tragedy-and-the-plague-of-untreated-trauma/",
        "description": "This week a 32-year-old aboriginal man on parole allegedly went on a stabbing rampage in Saskatchewan that killed 11 people and wounded 17. He died days later in police custody of self-inflicted injuries. This awful story illustrates how untreated trauma, caused by generational abuse and violence, lurks behind much of the world’s misery, from violent crimes to addiction, mistreatment of others and wars. It also illustrates the ongoing suffering of Native Americans and African Americans.\n\n\n\nIntergenerational trauma is the transmission through families of the terrible effects of historical events, such as conquest, slavery, serfdom, exploitation, incarceration, holocaust or war.\n\n\n\nUntreated, it can result in alcohol and substance abuse, broken relationships, destroyed families, domestic violence, child abuse, sexual abuse and violence or criminality. Aboriginals in Canada – as well as in the United States and Australia – have been victims on a mass scale because they were impoverished, defeated and traumatized by colonization and incarceration for generations.\n\n\n\nAfrican Americans suffer too as a result of slavery, abuse and racism over hundreds of years. In each case, individual or communal, the only “cure” is recognition and recovery through major psychological or social interventions.\n\n\n\nThe aboriginal Canadian man accused of murdering 11 innocent people in Saskatchewan is a case in point. Myles Sanderson was 32 and had been in trouble since he was 12. He never finished school and had been convicted of 59 crimes, including drunk driving, drug possession, assault, robbery and domestic abuse. Court records show that his childhood was characterized by neglect in homes where violence and substance abuse were normalized. He was diagnosed early on with post-traumatic stress disorder and at a recent parole board hearing said that regular use of drugs and hard alcohol would make him “lose (his) mind” and get angry. He was freed anyway, an unforgivable lapse on the part of authorities.\n\n\n\nCanada, the U.S. and Australia each have sizeable aboriginal populations with chronic problems due to untreated mass traumatization. No amount of financial assistance makes a dent, only enlightened leadership helps.\n\n\n\nNaturally, the overall statistics, in terms of human suffering, are depressingly high in all three countries. Each country destroyed tribal cultures, confiscated tribal lands (some returned or shared decades later), but, worst of all, placed generations of aboriginal children into residential homes, run by governments and churches, in an attempt to “assimilate” them into mainstream society.\n\n\n\nInstead, many of the children were abused and permanently isolated from their families, traditional communities, languages and way of life. And when released, many felt rejected by white societies and often by their own communities.\n\n\n\n“You store trauma if you don’t deal with it,” explains Catherine Twinn, a friend of mine and a lawyer from Alberta who has been an aboriginal activist, worked in government and continues to advocate on behalf of aboriginal causes. She served for several years in the Province of Alberta as a cabinet minister working on behalf of child welfare in the province. She said the experience was frustrating because the underlying problems are neither understood or dealt with by the communities or by governments.\n\n\n\n“The majority of the populations on many reserves have FASD [Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders from exposure to alcohol before birth],” she continued. “These cause physical problems or problems with behavior and learning. Often a person with FASD has a mix of these problems. White people don’t talk about this — they don’t want to be accused of perpetuating negative stereotypes or of being racists.”\n\n\n\nThe aboriginal tragedy in all three countries is swept aside even though the statistics are shocking. Canada has only 1.67 million aboriginals (First Nations and Inuit) or roughly 4 percent of its population of 38.6 million. But aboriginals represent 32 percent of the male federal prison population and 48 percent of the female prison population. Despite considerable concern and fiscal support in Canada for aboriginals, one in four lives in poverty, and 40 percent of Canada’s indigenous children live in poverty.\n\n\n\nThe United States is no better. There are 2.64 million Native Americans. That’s less than 1 percent of a population of 329.5 million. But aboriginals represent 2.1 percent of all federally incarcerated people. A 2022 article in Quartz stated: “Nationally, American Indians are incarcerated at a rate 38 percent higher than the U.S. average for all groups, according to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. In 19 states, they are overrepresented in the prison population more than any other ethnic group.”\n\n\n\nAustralia has a similar problem. There are 798,400 aboriginals out of its population of 25.79 million, or 3 percent. And yet, 27 percent of those in prison are aboriginal. Comparing Canada with Australia, The Guardian quoted Canadian expert Jonathan Rudin, head of Aboriginal Legal Services of Canada: “Aboriginal peoples in Canada were grappling with record numbers of their children being placed in the child welfare system and a huge over-representation in the criminal justice system, but these are the same issues that faced Australia. …The reason it’s the same story is English settler colonialism works the same way, which is that you find a place with an indigenous population and then you destroy them as a people.”\n\n\n\nNative residential schools in Canada and the U.S. were founded on the motto, “kill the Indian to save the man.” The U.S. Department of the Interior in 2021 issued a report that the federal government between 1819 and 1969 operated more than 400 schools in 37 states, and then-territories of Alaska and Hawaii.\n\n\n\nIn Australia, an estimated 10,500 children were forcibly removed and placed on missions to be trained as domestic servants between the late 1800s and the 1970s. In Canada, roughly 150,000 were placed in residential schools up until 1996. “Now we don’t have residential schools,” Rudin said. “What we have is child welfare, and when you graduate from child welfare, we have jails.”\n\n\n\nSome individuals and communities have made “the recovery journey,” but the problem remains widespread and destroys the cultural and socio-economic systems within these aboriginal groups.\n\n\n\nThis week’s slaughter in Saskatchewan is another result of this dysfunction. Said Twinn: “Pain is passed down from generation to generation until someone is brave enough to feel it. I don’t think the general public is well informed on trauma and intergenerational trauma. This is not only about aboriginals. The King of Jordan used to host an international conference on trans-generational trauma in recognition of the fact that the Middle East population is a traumatized population. The same applies to Russia, where there are high rates of addiction of 40 percent of so. Russia is like a big reserve.”\n\n\n\nTragically, untreated trauma plagues humanity and exists everywhere.\n\n\n\nDiane&nbsp;Francis&nbsp;is a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington at its Eurasia Center.

        "description": "Residential exposure to pollutants emitted by petroleum refineries could be related to the prevalence of stroke rates across the southern United States, a new study has found.\n\n\n\nLiving near petroleum production sites and refineries was potentially linked to 5.6 percent of strokes among adults surveyed in seven states across the region, according to the study, published on Thursday in&nbsp;Environmental Research Letters.\n\n\n\nThe process of refining petroleum, a common industry in the U.S. South, releases multiple pollutants that researchers have previously connected to strokes.\n\n\n\nBut the authors of the new study sought to identify the direct relationship between residential exposure to petroleum refining and the development of strokes.\n\n\n\n“The geographic concentration of economic sectors, and their associated by-products, is an underexplored, plausible risk factor for stroke,” lead author Honghyok Kim, who will be joining the University of Illinois at Chicago as an assistant professor this month, said in&nbsp;a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“By-products of petroleum production and refining include a mixture of pollutants that may impact the quality of adjacent air, soil, and potable water in residential areas,” Kim added.\n\n\n\nTo draw their conclusions, Kim and his colleagues at Yale, Brown and Seoul National universities combed through data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Population Level Analyses and Community Estimates for seven Southern U.S. states.\n\n\n\nThey narrowed down the data to areas within 2.5 kilometers (1.6 miles) or 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) of petroleum refineries — zones strongly correlated with high levels of sulfur dioxide, a byproduct of the refining process.\n\n\n\nAcross these areas, the authors observed that the prevalence of self-reported stroke ranged from 0.4 percent to 12.7 percent, while people of lower socioeconomic status and of Hispanic ethnicity tended to reside closer to the refineries.\n\n\n\nAfter analyzing the data, the scientists concluded that the percentage of strokes potentially explained by residential exposure to petroleum refineries was about 5.6 percent — a total of 2,200 cases.\n\n\n\nThe results differed by state, with Mississippi showing the highest percentage — 11.7 percent —&nbsp;of strokes possibly linked to such exposure, according to the study.\n\n\n\nZooming in much more locally, the scientists found even more dramatic variations in results based on census tract. One tract in Texas showed the highest prevalence of strokes potentially explained by petroleum refineries, at 25.3 percent, according to the study.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe authors also emphasized their observation that sociodemographic factors influenced the prevalence of strokes in each region, noting that those individuals of lower socioeconomic status were disproportionately affected.\n\n\n\nThis association with sociodemographic factors, they added, could “be relevant to understanding and addressing entrenched sociodemographic disparities in stroke outcomes.”",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3634209-dc-mayor-declares-public-emergency-over-busloads-of-migrants/",
        "description": "Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) on Thursday declared a public emergency over busloads of migrants from Texas and Arizona arriving in the nation's capital.\n\n\n\nBowser said she was creating a new Office of Migrant Services to assist with the emergency, estimating that 9,400 migrants have been bused to her city since April and hundreds more are expected this fall.\n\n\n\n\"What we're dealing with is a big unknown, and it's an unknown being imposed on us,\" the mayor said at a Thursday morning press conference. \"We're not a border town.\"\n\n\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) began busing migrants to Democratic cities over the spring, including New York City and Chicago.\n\n\n\nThe Republican governors are protesting the Biden administration's border policies, which they say are too lax. \n\n\n\nInundated by the migrants, Bowser requested the assistance of the D.C. National Guard in both July and August but was rebuffed by the Pentagon, which called the request \"inappropriate\" in a letter reviewed by The Hill.\n\n\n\nBowser on Thursday said she was continuing a dialogue with the federal government on the issue, which she called a \"political stunt.\"\n\n\n\n“This is a new challenge for DC, but I feel confident that if we lead with our values, and if we put the right systems in place, which we are doing with the Office of Migrant Services, then we will lead a response that makes our community proud,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\n\nA number of migrants sent to D.C. are staying at the NoMa Hampton Inn, previously a COVID-19 quarantine hotel, with financial support from the government. Bowser said the hotel would continue to serve as a temporary housing shelter for migrant families.\n\n\n\nThe new Office of Migrant Services will cost an initial $10 million and is authorized by the public emergency declaration, although Bowser is seeking to establish a more permanent framework for the office with D.C. Council members and secure reimbursement from the federal government.\n\n\n\nThe office will work to meet the buses coming into the city, facilitate travel outside of D.C. for families who want to leave and set up a \"distinct\" system to find housing and support other needs for migrants who want to stay.\n\n\n\nBowser said most migrants coming into the nation's capital have left the city, which she said makes clear that GOP governors are putting pressure on D.C. for political reasons.\n\n\n\n\"They are targeting Washington, D.C. — not because of any particular ties that the people boarding the buses have to Washington, D.C. — but they want to make a point to the federal government,\" Bowser said.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The university announced Tuesday that its expanded financial aid program – which previously covered costs for families earning less than $65,000 per year – will impact about a quarter of its undergraduate student body. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe $3,500 student contribution often earned through summer on-campus work will also be eliminated, potentially opening opportunities for students to study abroad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe university’s decision adds to a larger conversation around college affordability as wage increases struggle to keep pace with rising tuition and associated costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Princeton University students whose families earn less than $100,000 annually will pay nothing toward tuition, fees and room and board to the Ivy League school beginning in 2023.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe university announced Tuesday that its expanded financial aid program – which previously covered costs for families earning less than $65,000 per year – will impact about a quarter of its undergraduate student body. Around 5,300 undergraduate students are currently enrolled.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“One of Princeton’s defining values is our commitment to ensure that talented students from all backgrounds can not only afford a Princeton education but can flourish on our campus and in the world beyond it,” Princeton University President Christopher L. Eisgruber said in a media release. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“These improvements to our aid packages, made possible by the sustained generosity of our alumni and friends, will enhance the experiences of students during their time at Princeton and their choices and impact after they graduate.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the $3,500 student contribution often earned through summer on-campus work will be eliminated, potentially opening opportunities for students to study abroad. \n\n\n\nPrinceton will also increase its annual allocation for students' textbooks by more than $500 in 2023, which could free up funds for other expenses, according to the university.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe university’s decision adds to a larger conversation around college affordability as wage increases struggle to keep pace with rising tuition and associated costs. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nData shows the average cost of college has more than doubled in the 21st Century, and&nbsp;in 2022, the average cost including books, supplies and daily living expenses is more than $35,000. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRising costs have also contributed to a soaring student debt crisis, which previously left around 43 million student borrowers collectively on the hook for at least $1.6 trillion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYet President Biden announced late last month his administration would forgive up to $10,000 for all federal student loan borrowers and up to $20,000 for federal borrowers who received Pell Grants during college. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe administration expects that the plan will&nbsp;eliminate student debt for around 20 million borrowers should all who are eligible&nbsp;apply.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Queen Elizabeth II, who passed away on Thursday after being placed under medical supervision, has been a stabilizing force for her country and the world during her remarkable 70 year reign.\n\n\n\nShe has worked alongside 15 prime ministers, has met every U.S. president since Harry Truman, with the exception of Lyndon Johnson, and is the second longest reigning monarch in world history. \n\n\n\nBut she has also at times been a transformative influence while steering the British royal family through rapidly changing times. Here are a few of the ways that she has reshaped the British monarchy.\n\n\n\nUse of social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFILE - Britain's Queen Elizabeth II waves as she watches the flypast, with Prince Philip, to right, Prince William, centre, with his son Prince George, front, Kate, Duchess of Cambridge holding Princess Charlotte, centre left, with The Prince of Wales standing with The Duchess of Cornwall, and Princess Anne, fourth left, on the balcony during the Trooping The Colour parade at Buckingham Palace, in London, on June 11, 2016. (AP Photo/Tim Ireland, File)\n\n\n\nDuring her time on the throne, the royal family has utilized technology to stay engaged and grow their brand beyond Britain's borders. \n\n\n\nFrom Prince Harry's viral mic drop with his grandmother as part of a challenge to the Obamas promoting the Invictus games to photos of the youngest royals that routinely melt the internet's heart, social media has played a critical role in the monarchy's ability to keep up with changing times.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to helping the royals better connect with their followers, social media has also transformed the family's ability to break news, control the narrative about them and get ahead of negative news. \n\n\n\nCurrently on Twitter, the @RoyalFamily account has 4.8 million followers, the @KensingtonRoyal account has 2.4 million followers and the @ClarenceHouse account has 1.1 million followers. \n\n\n\nStance on divorce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFILE - Diana, Princess of Wales, left, and Britain's Queen Elizabeth II smile to well-wishers outside Clarence House in London on Aug. 4, 1987. (AP Photo/Martin Cleaver, File)\n\n\n\nFor hundreds of years, marrying a divorced person was considered out of the question for members of the British monarchy. \n\n\n\nOver time, Queen Elizabeth allowed divorces and remarriages within her family in an unprecedented split from tradition. \n\n\n\nHer sister, Princess Margaret, split up from divorced air force officer Peter Townsend in 1953, partly due to the fact that she would have had to give up her royal status if she married him. However, she later got a divorce from her husband, photographer&nbsp;Antony Armstrong-Jones, in 1978.  \n\n\n\nThree of Queen Elizabeth's four children — Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and Princess Anne — also ended up getting divorces. The queen famously marked the end of 1992, which saw the splits of Prince Charles and Princess Diana as well as Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, as an \"Annus Horribilis,\" which is Latin for \"a horrible year.\"  \n\n\n\nPrince Charles ultimately married Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, in 2005. Earlier this year, Queen Elizabeth announced in a letter commemorating&nbsp;the 70th anniversary of her reign that she wishes for Camilla to assume the title of Queen Consort when Prince Charles becomes king.\n\n\n\nTelevision Addresses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn image of Queen Elizabeth II and quotes from her historic TV broadcast commenting on the coronavirus epidemic are displayed at Piccadilly Circus in London, Wednesday April 8, 2020. An estimated 24 million people in the UK watched Sunday evening's TV broadcast when the Queen addressed the nation. (Yui Mok/PA via AP)\n\n\n\nAlthough the queen's televised addresses were rare — she only delivered TV addresses five times outside of her traditional Christmas Day messages and her Diamond Jubilee message in 2012 — they had a notable impact in allowing her to connect with people around the world in ways that monarchs before her had not been able to do.  \n\n\n\nHer special addresses included one about the Gulf War in 1991, perhaps her most famous address about Princess Diana's passing in 1997, a tribute to the Queen Mother after her death in 2002, and her latest address in 2020 about the coronavirus. \n\n\n\nThe queen's coronation was also the first to be broadcast live on television and was viewed by 20 million people, according to the BBC.  \n\n\n\nWalkabout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFILE – In this file photo from April 2, 1970, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II chats with children in Hobart, Australia. The Queen narrowly escaped disaster in 1970 when a large wooden log was placed on a railroad track in an apparent attempt to derail her train as she traveled across Australia, a retired detective said Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2009. (AP Photo/File)\n\n\n\nDuring an official tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1970, the queen transformed how members of the British royal family interact with the crowds of people who gather to see them. \n\n\n\nOn the 1970 tour, Queen Elizabeth walked alongside the crowds, as opposed to waving at them from a protected distance, as had been the norm for royals up until that point. This change helped create a new standard for how the royal family interacts with crowds both in Britain and around the world, as the \"walkabout\" is now a regular practice for royals at public events.",

        "description": "Queen Elizabeth II has died at the age of 96, ending the longest reign for a British head of state in history, a staggering 70-year tenure that included the administrations of 14 U.S. presidents and a dramatic reshaping of the Commonwealth.\n\n\n\nThe queen “died peacefully” at Balmoral Castle, her Scottish estate, on Thursday, Buckingham Palace announced.\n\n\n\nThe news of Elizabeth’s death came just hours after Buckingham Palace had said that her doctors were “concerned for Her Majesty’s health,” and that she was remaining under medical supervision.&nbsp;Earlier this week, Elizabeth had overseen the appointment of new British Prime Minister Liz Truss. But a virtual meeting the next day of the queen’s Privy Council was canceled after doctors advised her to rest.\n\n\n\nThe future queen took an unexpected path to the throne as a child, after her uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated and her father was proclaimed King George VI.\n\n\n\nAs a 21-year-old, the next in line to the British throne said in a radio address that she intended to dedicate her life to the role: \"I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.\"\n\n\n\nIn 1952, at just 27, she became queen following her father's death.\n\n\n\nHer unprecedented&nbsp;reign included not just cultural and societal shifts, but changes to the British empire itself. When she was crowned nearly seven decades ago, Britain had more than 70 territories overseas. Now, that number stands at 15, after Barbados removed Elizabeth as its head of state in December.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nElizabeth gave birth to her eldest son and heir apparent, Prince Charles, in 1948. The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, went on to welcome three other children: Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward.\n\n\n\nIn her lifetime, the queen met with all but one of the American presidents, Lyndon Johnson, since Harry Truman. She delivered an address to a joint meeting of Congress, becoming the first British monarch to do so, in 1991. She met with President Biden in June for the first time since he entered office.\n\n\n\nThough she rarely granted interviews, American political leaders often heaped praise on Elizabeth.\n\n\n\n\"I don't think she’d be insulted but she reminded me of my mother, the look of her and just the generosity,\" Biden said after meeting with Elizabeth earlier this year.\n\n\n\nMichelle Obama wrote in her 2018 memoir that the queen was \"warm and personable\" when she met her, and that the two bonded over their uncomfortable shoes.\n\n\n\n\"I confessed then to the Queen that my feet were hurting. She confessed that hers hurt, too. We looked at each other then with identical expressions, like, When is all this standing around with world leaders going to finally wrap up? And with this, she busted out with a fully charming laugh,\" Obama said in \"Becoming.\"\n\n\n\nFormer President Trump said he shared a \"great relationship\" with the British monarch, saying during his 2019 visit to the United Kingdom that \"her people said she hasn't had so much fun in 25 years.\"\n\n\n\nIn June, Elizabeth reached a historic milestone, with London playing host to a massive, four-day Platinum Jubilee celebration to mark the monarch’s 70 years on the throne.\n\n\n\nThe queen missed part of the extravaganza, a thanksgiving church service, after Buckingham Palace said she experienced “some discomfort” at Jubilee events.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFollowing the spectacle, Elizabeth said in a statement that she was “inspired by the kindness, joy and kinship that has been so evident in recent days.”\n\n\n\n“And I hope this renewed sense of togetherness will be felt for many years to come,” she said at the time.\n\n\n\nDescribed as a private person in one of the world's most public roles, Elizabeth — who was named Time magazine's&nbsp;\"Woman of the Year\" in 1953 — became a cultural icon of sorts as queen. Countless performers have portrayed the monarch on television and the big screen: Helen Mirren won an Academy Award when she took on the title role in 2006's \"The Queen,\" while Claire Foy and Olivia Colman both took home Emmy Awards for their turns as Elizabeth in Netflix's \"The Crown.\" &nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe held the Guinness World Record for \"most currencies featuring the same individual,\" with her image appearing on the coins of at least 35 different countries.\n\n\n\nThroughout the countless world events and elections she lived through, Elizabeth upheld the royal family's protocol requiring its members to \"remain strictly neutral with respect to political matters.\"\n\n\n\nShe also remained a steady presence amid the scandalous storms, personal dramas, and tragedies that the royal family faced throughout her reign, including the 1997 death of her former daughter-in-law, Princess Diana, sexual assault allegations against Andrew and claims of racism.\n\n\n\nMeghan, the Duchess of Sussex, whose mother is Black and father is white, and who's married to Elizabeth's grandson, Prince Harry, said in a 2021 interview that there were conversations within the royal family when she was pregnant about \"how dark\" the skin of her child would be. The couple later said neither Elizabeth nor Philip, who died last year at 99, made the skin tone comments.\n\n\n\nIn a rare move, Elizabeth took to the airwaves in the spring of 2020 to address her country in a rallying cry of sorts amid the increasingly deadly coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\n\n\"We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return,\" she said at the time. \"We will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.\"\n\n\n\nUpdated 1:47 p.m.",

        "description": "The first Elizabethan era ended on March 24, 1603, when 69-year-old Queen Elizabeth I died in her sleep at Richmond Palace. “This morning, about three o’clock, her Majesty departed from this life, mildly like a lamb, easily like a ripe apple from the tree,” the lawyer John Manningham wrote in his diary. Elizabeth I’s 45-year reign was a “golden age,” a course of events that no one would have predicted at her birth. She had survived her mother’s execution, her half-sister’s jealousy, her cousin Mary’s plotting, and the antagonism of Europe’s great Catholic powers.The death of Queen Elizabeth II today ends the second Elizabethan era. The past 70 years might not feel golden, but they were an age. She steered the monarchy from the world of aristocracy and deference in which she was born, through the social liberation of the swinging 1960s and the bitter divisions of the ’80s and onward into a new millennium; past a Scottish-independence referendum that would have broken apart 300 years of the union; past Brexit, which sundered her kingdom from the European Union; to her final days in a world of smartphones and Instagram. Even as the world changed around her, she remained in place. Like the North Star in the night sky, she was a fixed point, something by which to orient yourself.[Read: Looking back on Queen Elizabeth’s 90 years]The second Elizabeth was born on April 21, 1926, and has reigned over Britain since 1952. She was six weeks older than Marilyn Monroe, three years older than Anne Frank, nine years older than Elvis Presley—all figures of the unreachable past. She was older than nylon, Scotch tape, and The Hobbit. She was old enough to have trained as an army driver and mechanic in the last months of the Second World War. Very few Britons can remember life without her: Fewer than 150,000 people are older than 95 in this country. She reigned so long that even her voice changed: The aristocratic vowels of the early 20th century—“lawst” for “lost,” “femileh” for “family”—gave way to a softer, less ostentatious accent. During the pandemic, she took to fulfilling royal engagements over Zoom.What happens next? The Queen’s death has been the subject of rigorous planning for many years. Royal transitions are supposed to be orderly, seamless, well choreographed: In 1936, her grandfather George V was given a fatal dose of morphine at 11 p.m. so that his death could be announced “in the morning papers rather than the less appropriate evening journals.”The plan now in action is known by courtiers as “London Bridge.” It began with special announcements on the BBC, the state broadcaster, which will now edit its programming for several days in case anything inappropriately irreverent or entertaining disrupts the official mourning period. There will be a state funeral, with politicians and royals from around the world. And then the coronation of the next monarch.The official souvenir brochure from when Elizabeth II was crowned, in 1953, is a snapshot of a lost world. Its opening page is stamped with gold and bears the coats of arms of Commonwealth countries, many of which no longer exist or were renamed upon independence: Aden (now part of Yemen); Bechuanaland (Botswana); Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe); Ceylon (Sri Lanka); Basutoland (Lesotho); Sarawak (now part of Malaysia); British Honduras (Belize); and Swaziland (Eswatini). The foreword by the Duke of Gloucester, her uncle, emphasizes Elizabeth’s youth—“the new reign of a young Queen”—while the historian Arthur Bryant declares overleaf that “a coronation is a nation’s birthday.”The coronation of King Charles III—if he does indeed adopt that name—will not have the same pomp. Not only is he 73 years old, an heir who has waited seven decades to take the throne, but the procession to Westminster will surely reflect Britain’s diminished standing in the world. In 1953, the young Elizabeth II was escorted by “the colonial contingents”—military forces from the territories she still ruled, such as Southern Rhodesia—as well as troops from the Commonwealth. Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s prime minister, traveled in a carriage to the abbey, as did the leaders of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Today, all three countries have significant enthusiasm for republicanism, and their leaders will have to carefully consider where respect shades into obeisance.Nonetheless, the transition will not be devoid of pageantry. The new king will be anointed with sacred oil, drawn from an eagle-shaped vessel, under a canopy held by four knights of the garter. He will wear a royal robe, be presented with spurs and a sword, and hold the orb and scepter. The ceremony is an explicitly religious one, because the new king will also become head of the Church of England, “defender of the faith.” This time around, though, there may be greater signals of the presence of other faiths, and perhaps even of those who have none.That would be fitting. It’s a strange thing to say about a 96-year-old whose ancestors have held the throne since the 9th century (with one decade-long hiatus in the 17th century) but Elizabeth II was a modernizer. In 1992, she voluntarily announced that she would start paying income tax. She repeatedly trimmed the Civil List, now known as the Sovereign Grant, to support fewer princelings and dukes who were not core members of “The Firm.” She announced in the days preceding her Platinum Jubilee this year that she hoped that Camilla, Charles’s second wife, would be known as “Queen” rather than “Princess Consort.” That decree overturned the compromise proposed to mollify fans of Charles’s first wife, Diana, when he remarried in 2005. Where Elizabeth’s sister was once prevented from marrying the man she loved because he had been married before, Britain will now have a previously divorced king married to a previously divorced wife.More than anyone, Elizabeth understood Britain’s sense of itself as an old country. Look at our biggest private companies: Unilever was originally founded by soapmaking brothers in the north of England, and HSBC began life as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Both date back to Queen Victoria’s reign. GSK, one of the world’s largest drugmakers, goes back further, tracing its heritage to a single London pharmacy in 1715. In 1995, future Prime Minister Tony Blair said he wanted to make Britain feel like a “young country” again. Back then, the queen was nearly 70. She and the country continued to get older.When Elizabeth was born, she represented stability and hope to the British monarchy. Her birthplace was a private house in London, 17 Bruton Street, where her parents lived at the time: Albert Frederick Arthur George, Duke of York, the second son of King George V, and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, a Scottish aristocrat who became the Duchess of York. The common assumption is that, like Elizabeth I, no one expected her to be Queen. That is incorrect. Her grandfather the king was past 60, and her uncle, the future Edward VIII, was 31 and showed no signs of marrying. She could have been displaced by a younger brother—at the time, the British succession prioritized boys—but her only sibling was a younger sister, Margaret.[Read: How the British royal family became a global brand]The year of her birth, 1926, was a turbulent one; a general strike broke out before she was two weeks old, and became the largest industrial dispute in British history. Then came the Great Depression, bringing unemployment and poverty to millions. Thousands of workers joined “hunger marches” around the country. The world was already moving in new directions that the British monarchy had to follow: Before Elizabeth was a year old, her parents left her behind to sail to Australia for a ceremony recognizing its new capital, Canberra. On their return, the HMS Renown brought back three tons of presents for the little princess, including 20 live parrots. (The toys were given to children’s hospitals. The fate of the parrots is unknown.)She never went to school; instead, she was tutored by governesses at Windsor Castle and then Buckingham Palace. That left her with an odd, patchwork education, one that owed more to the 18th century than the 20th—art, music, horse-riding, drawing, Latin, French—all overseen by her mother, the Duchess of York. “When, for example, it became apparent that Princess Elizabeth would never progress beyond the simplest elements of mathematics, it did not worry the Duchess at all,” records Dermot Morrah, Arundel Herald Extraordinary, in his 1958 book, The Work of the Queen.Princess Elizabeth’s life changed in 1936, “the year of the three kings,” which was also the year that the Nazis held an Olympic Games in Berlin and the Spanish Civil War began. In Britain, George V died in January. The man she knew as “Uncle David” took the throne as Edward VIII, and then abdicated within months to marry a twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson. That left Elizabeth’s shy, stuttering father, who adopted the regnal name George VI, to take control of a battered institution at a time of global instability. Elizabeth was present at his coronation, wearing a long train of purple velvet, alongside Margaret.The outbreak of the Second World War prompted Elizabeth’s first broadcast appearance: a radio address to children who were in danger or separated from their parents. “We children at home are full of cheerfulness and courage,” she told the nation. “We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well.” The King and Queen had rejected the suggestion that the princesses should be safely packed off to Canada, although they did send them to the quieter town of Windsor. The royal couple kept working at Buckingham Palace, which was bombed several times.The war meant that her adolescence was marked by seclusion and sacrifice, rather than debutante balls and dances. One of her few indulgences came on V-E Day, when the Allies declared victory in Europe. Elizabeth and Margaret walked down the road outside Buckingham Palace with only a young officer for company, and were entirely unrecognized. “Poor darlings,” their father wrote in his diary that night. “They have never had any fun yet.”Once the conflict was over, George VI’s poor health meant that the young Elizabeth quickly assumed royal responsibilities. She toured southern Africa with her parents in the spring of 1947, and married Philip Mountbatten, another great-great-grandchild of Queen Victoria, in November that year. (Their marriage lasted 73 years, until his death in April 2021.) Their first child, Charles, was born the following year, and three more followed: Anne, Andrew, and Edward. Princess Elizabeth was in Kenya in February 1952 when she received the news of her father’s death. She opened Parliament for the first time in November and gave her first broadcast as Queen that Christmas.The Queen’s early life became part of her mythology. Her father was a reluctant king; she proved a dutiful queen. She provided a personal link to Britain’s proudest moment, still referenced by politicians today, as the country that stood alone against Hitler at the start of the Second World War. That conflict once provided a powerful story to Europe of the dangers of totalitarianism and the necessity of liberal democracy. With every veteran and survivor who dies, it passes a little further into history, and its lessons fade from memory.Elizabeth’s wartime upbringing instilled a sense of duty that was evident throughout her life. Well into her 90s, she was still carrying out nearly 300 engagements a year, opening hospitals and hosting garden parties. By that point, because of her longevity and reluctance to give interviews, she was at once famous and unknown. In 2016, a tabloid newspaper suggested that she backed Brexit, but who knows? The most she said about the possibility of Scottish independence was that the country should “think very carefully about the future” when voting in the 2014 referendum. (David Cameron, then prime minister, was later overheard on a hot mic claiming that she “purred down the line” when he told her the union was safe.) We know a little about the weekly audiences she held with British prime ministers—from Winston Churchill to Liz Truss, who took office just this week—although she treated them more as listening exercises than opportunities to hold forth. When Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan asked her for advice in the 1970s, she replied: “That’s for you to decide. That is what you are paid for.”This strategic ambiguity is now the default mode of European royals. It is a straitjacket, voluntarily entered, and for some it is hard to bear. Rejecting its strictures was a large part of why Prince Harry moved to California and gave up his royal status; he wanted to speak out—whether against the media’s treatment of his wife, Meghan, or on his favored topics of animal conservation, racial justice, and veterans’ affairs. Harry might have found neutrality suffocating, but the same force allowed the Queen to become a symbol. Monarchy offers something above politics, perhaps closer to religion. At the end of the 1998 film Elizabeth, the Protestant Elizabeth Tudor renounces her lover, Lord Robert, and consciously remakes herself as the “Virgin Queen,” a living substitute for Mary and the other icons of the Catholic Church that she has asked her subjects to renounce. “Observe, Lord Burghley,” she tells the court, appearing before them for the first time in white lead paint. “I am married to England.”[Read: The Crown takes the shine off Queen Elizabeth’s reign]The second Elizabeth accomplished something equally impressive, just as the world lost its deference for elites. Most celebrities attract fans who are desperate to speak to them, be with them, be noticed by them. The Queen commanded another type of respect. “I had expected to see people pushing themselves into the queen’s path, but the opposite was true,” the author Hilary Mantel once wrote after attending a reception at Buckingham Palace. “The queen walked through the reception areas at an even pace, hoping to meet someone, and you would see a set of guests, as if swept by the tide, parting before her or welling ahead of her into the next room.” The guests concentrated on the paintings, feigning interest in Vermeer, “at the expense of the enigma moving among us, smiling with gallant determination.”The new king cannot hope to replicate this feeling—the intense desire that people had for Elizabeth II to remain an icon, not a human being. We know too much about Charles, such as his toxic relationship with Diana and the erotic phone call with Camilla that veered into a chat about heavy traffic on the roads. We know that an aide once squeezed his toothpaste for him, and that he received 1 million euros in cash from a Qatari businessman, stuffed into a suitcase. We know that he intervened in planning decisions, pushing his favored architectural styles, and that he bombarded government ministers with strong opinions in what became known as the “black spider memos,” after his terrible handwriting.The British press has been notably harder on Charles than it ever was on his mother, and the royal family has had to learn new tactics to deal with the modern media. (The Queen Mother’s unofficial motto still rules, though: “Never complain, never explain.”) Even if he lives as long as his mother, the new king will have a comparatively short time to shape the royal family in his own image. He will have to deal with rising anti-Commonwealth sentiment in the Caribbean—Barbados became a republic in 2021, in a ceremony attended by Charles, then Prince of Wales, and Rihanna, representing old and new ideas of royalty—and perhaps a fresh referendum on the monarchy in Australia. He must address the fallout from the unhappy departure of Harry and Meghan to California, and the accusations of racism they made against the family. His other son, William, can help: He reluctantly accepts press intrusion as the price of the job, regularly releasing sweet pictures of their children to the media, and is more at ease with modern life generally. (When he moved to Windsor in August, the papers breathlessly reported that he and his wife, Kate, would have no live-in servants.) Gentle, unthreatening evolution is the promise of constitutional monarchy.“The conception of monarchy as a way of life is not easy to explain to those who are unaccustomed to it,” Morrah wrote in 1958, just six years into Elizabeth II’s reign. “To peoples whose social system and patriotic tradition are founded upon revolt against a distant or authoritarian king—to the Americans and the French, for example—it is apt to seem a paradox. Such as these are inclined to suppose that the British people only continue to tolerate their ancient monarchy because its real content has been emptied out of it by political progress.” But this was not true, Morrah argued. The British monarchy is one of the few institutions in history to have voluntarily ceded power, whether it be Charles II accepting the existence of Parliament or Elizabeth II paying income tax. Moving to a realm beyond politics has only made it more special. “Elizabeth II is just as fully a queen as ever was Elizabeth I, though without a tithe [tenth] of her predecessor’s personal authority,” Morrah wrote. “She is Queen not because she governs England but because England would not be itself without her.”“I know I am but mortal,” Elizabeth I often told her courtiers, as they worried about the succession. Elizabeth II knew that too, and approached her death with her usual unsentimental efficiency. The funeral guest list is long since decided. The choreography of the next coronation has been rehearsed. Some dukes are dusting off their coronets as we speak. The Queen is dead; long live the King. The world must now discover, after a reign that lasted seven decades, what England, and Britain, is without her.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/twins-dfa-austin-davis.html",
        "description": "The Twins announced Thursday that they&#8217;ve reinstated right-hander Cole Sands from the injured list and opened a spot on the active roster by designating left-hander Austin Davis for assignment. Minnesota had claimed Davis from the Red Sox on Aug. 31 after he was also designated for assignment in Boston.\nDavis, 29, struggled to a 5.47 ERA in 54 1/3 innings with the Red Sox this year and wasn&#8217;t able to right the ship in a brief stint with the Twins. Though he appeared in just two games, the lefty yielded three runs on a hit and four walks in just 1 2/3 innings. His DFA will drop the Twins back down to two lefties in the bullpen &#8212; Caleb Thielbar and Jovani Moran &#8212; and open a spot on the Twins&#8217; 40-man roster.\nOriginally a 12th-round pick of the Phillies, Davis has appeared in the Majors in each of the past five seasons but has never posted a single-season ERA south of 5.00 and currently carries a lifetime mark of 5.61 in 144 frames at the MLB level. He&#8217;s fanned 24% of his opponents against an 11% walk rate and kept 39.5% of batted balls against him on the ground.\nDavis has regularly excelled at limiting hard contact, evidenced by a career 87.2 mph average exit velocity and 33.4% hard-hit rate. However, when opponents do square him up, the result is often a worst-case scenario; even with that lack of consistent hard contact, he&#8217;s still yielded an average of 1.25 homers per nine innings pitched. With the trade deadline now well in the rear-view mirror, the only options for the Twins will be to place Davis on outright or release waivers. He reached three years of Major League service time earlier this season, so even if he clears he&#8217;ll have the right to reject an assignment to Triple-A in favor of free agency.\nAs for the 25-year-old Sands, he&#8217;s followed a standout 2021 Double-A campaign (2.46 ERA in 80 1/3 innings) with a rough year both in Triple-A and the Majors. The 2018 fifth-rounder has been saddled with a 5.70 ERA in 53 1/3 Triple-A frames and an even more troublesome 6.56 mark in 23 1/3 MLB innings. That said, Sands has fanned and walked batters at a better-than-average rate while also being plagued by sky-high averages on balls in play (.404 in Triple-A, 3.62 in the Majors).",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/dodgers-tyler-anderson-breakout-free-agent-all-star.html",
        "description": "Each offseason, the Dodgers are mentioned as at least a speculative favorite for seemingly every top-tier free agent. They&#8217;re willing to pursue elite players even in the absence of a true positional need, and they annually sport one of the league&#8217;s highest payrolls. This winter should be no exception, with headlines eventually linking the Dodgers to the best free agent shortstops, including their own impending free agent Trea Turner, and top-of-the-market starting pitching.\nLos Angeles doesn&#8217;t just pursue established superstars in the Freddie Freeman mold, though. President of baseball operations Andrew Friedman, general manager Brandon Gomes and the rest of the front office also leverage their payroll flexibility in another way. While it&#8217;s not as visible or exciting, the Dodgers roll the dice on plenty of mid-tier free agents. They signed nine players to major league deals last offseason alone, seven of whom inked a one-year guarantee. It was a blend of high-upside players who carried injury or performance risks with more stable, lower-variance veterans to round out the roster.\nTyler Anderson seemed to fall into the latter bucket. He&#8217;s been a durable back-of-the-rotation arm for much of his career. Anderson lost chunks of the 2017 and &#8217;19 seasons with left knee issues, but he started a full slate of 32 games in 2018 and hasn&#8217;t gone on the injured list at any point in the past three years. That kind of reliability appealed to a Dodgers team that opened the season with Dustin May on the IL, Clayton Kershaw coming off a season-ending arm issue and Andrew Heaney (another lower-tier free agent pickup) seeking a rebound after a dismal 2021 campaign.\n\nReliable as he was in taking the ball every fifth day, Anderson didn&#8217;t look like a potential impact arm. He&#8217;d only once posted an ERA below 4.00 in a season, and that was in his 2016 rookie campaign. The southpaw had the tough task of pitching his home games at Coors Field for his first four years, but he also had mixed results in a 2021 season split between two more pitcher-friendly settings. Anderson played the year with the Pirates and Mariners, combining for a 4.53 ERA over 167 innings. A nine-run clunker during his third-to-last start of the season inflated that number, but he carried an ERA hovering around 4.00 for much of the season.\nFeaturing a fastball that averages under 91 MPH, Anderson looked the part of a back-end arm who throws strikes and keeps teams in a ballgame for five innings. That netted him an $8MM guarantee from L.A. in Spring Training. That would&#8217;ve been a generally worthwhile investment if Anderson had merely replicated his 2021 numbers over another full season. Instead, he&#8217;s posted easily the best showing of his career to date.\nThrough 26 appearances, the former first-round pick has worked 154 2/3 innings of 2.73 ERA ball. He&#8217;s neither striking batters out nor generating ground-balls at a particularly robust clip, with his respective 19% and 39.7% rates each checking in below the league averages. Yet Anderson has improved upon the aspect of his game in which he&#8217;d already been most effective: getting opponents to offer at pitcher&#8217;s pitches.\nDespite not having eye-popping raw stuff, Anderson has always been adept at inducing chases on pitches outside the strike zone. Opponents went after 37.2% of offerings he threw outside the zone last season, well above the 31.5% league average for starters. He&#8217;s pushed that already impressive rate further, getting hitters to chase a personal-high 38.9% of pitches this year.\nThat ability to get hitters to swing at bad pitches drives two key aspects of Anderson&#8217;s success. It&#8217;s helped him avoid free passes, with this season&#8217;s 4.9% walk rate among the best in the game. Anderson has always been adept at pounding the strike zone, and his combination of plenty of pitches within the zone and ability to get hitters to swing at would-be balls keeps him frequently in advantageous counts. It&#8217;s also worked to avoid especially damaging contact, with opponents having a hard time squaring him up. Anderson ranks among the league&#8217;s top starters in suppressing hard contact, thus far allowing him to avoid home run issues that have plagued him in the past.\nThe Dodgers have already received more than they could&#8217;ve expected from a reasonably low-cost acquisition. He could have a hard time cracking a playoff rotation that&#8217;ll certainly feature Julio Urías, Kershaw, May and (if healthy) Tony Gonsolin, but he&#8217;s likely to be on the mound for some high-leverage innings this October in some capacity. Anderson also looks to have set himself up for a better payday on his return trip to the open market, although how robust the interest will be depends on how much teams buy into his ability to sustain this year&#8217;s elite results.\nHis lack of premium velocity or swing-and-miss stuff gives him a thin margin for error. Even modest regression in his ability to induce bad swing decisions could lead to results more akin to a back-of-the-rotation arm than this year&#8217;s All-Star form. After all, it&#8217;s not as if Anderson&#8217;s success has come completely out of the blue. He&#8217;d already been above-average at getting batters to chase and make weak contact in seasons where his overall output was roughly league average.\nThe 32-year-old has made tweaks to his repertoire this year that probably helped push his game forward. He&#8217;s taken some speed off his changeup, which is getting more downward depth. Batters are swinging through it more often as a result, and given the alterations to his changeup, it&#8217;s probably not a coincidence he&#8217;s faring better than ever against right-handed batters. That&#8217;s a promising improvement, but like the other gains he&#8217;s made this season, it&#8217;s a rather subtle one.\nPut all the changes together, and Anderson looks as if he&#8217;s better now than he has been. Is he a true talent 2.73 ERA pitcher who&#8217;ll be an annual All-Star? Probably not. His future level likely falls somewhere in between this year&#8217;s outstanding numbers and the pedestrian 4.49 mark he posted from 2020-21. Yet even if Anderson allows around three and a half to four earned runs per nine innings moving forward, he&#8217;s a valuable pitcher &#8212; particularly if he can continue to stay healthy and take the ball every fifth day.\nAs MLBTR&#8217;s Mark Polishuk noted last month, the Dodgers will have to at least consider the possibility of tagging Anderson with a qualifying offer this offseason. It still seems they&#8217;d opt against making an offer that, in recent seasons, has sat in the $18-19MM range, but that it&#8217;s even a worthwhile consideration is a testament to his strong year. At the very least, Anderson looks to have pitched his way into the first multi-year contract of his career when he returns to free agency.\nImage courtesy of USA Today Sports.",

Inspiring, because of the leadership and pedagogical knowledge and understanding of Sue Vermes and her team – the best of committed and trained professionals.

The education story told here is replicated across the spectrum of public sector services. The role of inequality is mentioned, the depressing aspects being its continued presence in the UK and the lack of political acknowledgement – perhaps denial – of its existence and influence.Much government comment is about what, not why. It’s probably too much to expect that those who voted for the new government and prime minister could be asked to read this piece.Blaine Stothard London Continue reading...",

        "description": "Planned Parenthood has named a DFL state representative from Mendota Heights to be its new CEO. Planned Parenthood North Central States has announced Ruth Richardson will be its new CEO, effective this fall. She succeeds Sarah Stoesz, who announced last year that she would be stepping down after serving for 21 years as the head of the health care and abortion services provider. The organization now includes 30 clinics in Minnesota, as well as Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. Richardson is a two-term state representative of District 52B and is on the ballot for re-election in November. Richardson told MPR News host Cathy Wurzer she intends to seek re-election.“By design, Minnesota has a citizen’s legislature,” Richardson said. “There are many folks that are within the legislature who have other jobs. We have business owners, we have educators, we have farmers, you know, insurance professionals, real estate professionals.”If she wins, Richardson would not oversee what Planned Parenthood called “political work” or “lobbying” as long she was in the Legislature. She said she would respect rules in the legislature to recuse herself from votes where there are conflicts of interest.“There is already a firewall between the nonprofit healthcare side and the political side” of Planned Parenthood, Richardson said. “And that will continue.”Richardson is an attorney from Mendota Heights and will be the first Black woman to lead Planned Parenthood in the region.“Reproductive justice and just the human right to health care is something that was really instilled in me as as a child, hearing the birthing stories of my mom and her sisters growing up in segregated Mississippi,” she said.Click the audio player above to listen to the full episode. Subscribe to the Minnesota Now podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.  We attempt to make transcripts for Minnesota Now available the next business day after a broadcast.

In 1989, its Art Deco facade was landmarked, although the interior was not, leading to it being gutted in 2006. Over the years, The Metro showed first-run, art-house, and porn films.\nTo find out what its next iteration will be, register for the Zoom at the link below:\nhttps://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_-XbJJB7PT2Cfb6OgMoSp8A\n\nThanks to Mark Elliot for the tip.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3631250-why-we-should-link-student-loan-forgiveness-to-national-service/",
        "description": "President Biden recently announced a plan to forgive an estimated $240 billion in student loans for some 25 million people. Last month, the Department of Defense announced our armed forces cannot meet their enlistment goals. These two events are not obviously connected, but should be.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConsider the military’s situation. The services face their most serious challenge since the creation of the All Volunteer Force in 1973. While an occasional shortfall doesn’t presage a return of the draft, our inability to attract qualified personnel is a significant problem. But there is a more troubling undercurrent: The idea of service to the nation of almost any kind is declining.  \n\n\n\nTo sustain basic, minimal readiness, the Army needs about 68,000 new enlisted recruits annually; the Navy needs 33,000; the Air Force, 32,000; the Marine Corp, about 32,000; and the Coast Guard, 3,700. All of the services have had trouble hitting their targets, but the Coast Guard has had the most trouble meeting its recruiting goals.  \n\n\n\nThose new personnel requirements total just under 168,000 young people annually. To put that goal into perspective, it is just under 4 percent of America’s 4.3 million 18-year-olds. Why is it so hard to attract a relatively modest portion of the target population?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne reason is economic: COVID has created a hot labor market for entry-level workers. Another is that recruiters have had trouble getting real face-time — as opposed to FaceTime — with potential recruits. More disturbingly, however, a large and growing proportion of young people are simply unqualified to serve: Oonly 23 percent of 17- to 24-year-olds can meet basic standards without some sort of waiver.  \n\n\n\nA high school diploma or GED long has been a minimal qualification for military service; yet 15 percent of this cohort will have neither. So, in June, and foreseeing a significant shortfall in recruits, the Army suspended its diploma requirement. But facing widespread criticism, the Army retreated from the policy after just one week.  \n\n\n\nIt gets worse. Another 31 percent of 17- to 24-year-olds can’t enlist because they are obese. An estimated 10 percent are ineligible because of criminal records, and an additional 15 percent won’t make the cut because of more-than-casual drug usage. In short, fully 71 percent of the age cohort could not serve even if they wanted to. \n\n\n\nSo, the military has to find 168,000 young people interested and able to serve from the remaining 1.2 million 18-year-olds. That is fully 14 percent of the age cohort — and the military has to do it year after year to replace people retiring and completing their enlistment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany conservative wags blame the shortfall on the military’s woke marketing messages. The Navy, for example, released a video during Pride Month explaining to sailors how to create a “safe space” by using proper gender pronouns. And a recent Army commercial featured a young woman who proudly spoke of how her two moms encouraged her to serve her country. \n\n\n\nPresumably, the marketing professionals the services employ understand their target audiences and are able to accurately measure the effectiveness of such ad campaigns. If an ad isn’t working, no marketer is going to waste money continuing to run it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is a more serious problem: The belief among young people that they have any obligation to serve the nation is eroding. They no longer care.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor more than 20 years, I have been writing about the potential benefits of a mandatory program of national service — benefits to the nation and to the individual. I believe a program of mandatory national service can forge common experiences, develop important work habits, and expose participants to people very different from themselves; it is diversity in action.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSuch a program would incorporate not just military service — which would remain voluntary — but also real programs that meet real needs that we all could value. It could include, for example, environmental conservation work, pre-K assistance in schools, and senior citizen companionship.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOver the years, when I have asked people whether they would support such a program, the answer was invariably, “It depends on the specifics.” So, beginning several years ago, I hired a reputable polling firm to gauge receptivity to the idea. They asked respondents if they would support a program structured as follows:&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“All citizens and permanent residents (Green Card holders) will be required to participate in an 18-month National Service program. Service can be started anytime between an individual’s 18th birthday and their 22nd birthday. Service shall include healthcare assistance, infrastructure/environmental repair, early childhood education programs, eldercare assistance, and military service. (Participation in the military option shall be voluntary.) National service participants shall receive free communal room, board, and a minimal subsistence allowance. Participants shall receive $10,000 upon successful completion of their service. People who fail to successfully complete their National Service obligation shall not be eligible for any federal student loan or mortgage guarantee program.” \n\n\n\nLast month, I again asked the polling company to conduct the survey. The results could not have been more different — or discouraging.  \n\n\n\nTwo years ago, 80 percent of 18- to 22-year-olds supported the proposition. This year, the number had fallen to 34 percent. Similarly, in 2020, 88 percent of adults supported mandatory service; today, it’s 38 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy the change? Pandemic lockdowns, perhaps. An economy in distress. The horrific images coming out of Ukraine — which are very different from the high-tech antiseptic promises of the military’s commercials. Perhaps it’s the notion that people are owed government compensation. Or maybe it is our splintering into tribal-like factions, each of which values an often different and mutually exclusive “common good.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFortunately, the president’s recent plan to forgive student loans gives us an opportunity to reconsider the idea of national service through a fresh lens. As the debate over whether we should forgive billions of dollars in student loans intensifies — and seems to cross traditional party lines — perhaps it is time to broaden the conversation. We should be asking whether we, as individuals, have an obligation to our society, what form that obligation might take, and what it is worth financially.  \n\n\n\nFor more than 75 years, the federal government has offered financial aid to members of the armed forces for their service: the GI Bill. This, of course, raises the question: Can we — should we — link tuition relief with some sort of national service besides the military?  \n\n\n\nThe GI Bill helped 8 million World War II veterans attend universities, doubling the number of Americans who earned college degrees. Another 10 million Korean War and Vietnam veterans received education benefits, and the current iteration of the law has helped nearly 1 million with aid totaling $12 billion. People can take advantage of generous tuition assistance while they are serving — to help them advance in their careers — and when they get out. It is a system that works and is equitable. \n\n\n\nLoan forgiveness in exchange for national service, rather than just for often self-indulgent personal college choices, makes for a more compelling national discussion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwo things are clear: What we have seen in Ukraine demonstrates that the world is a dangerous place. And a strong, capable military is essential to thwarting aggression and preserving peace. I believe mandatory national service across all fields would broaden the pool of young people who would voluntarily choose a military option. But if we can’t sustain an All Volunteer Force, we had better deal with the alternative of a draft — before it is too late.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSteve Cohen is an attorney at Pollock Cohen, and a former member of the board of directors of the United States Naval Institute. ",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday unanimously upheld Washington state’s ban on conversion therapy, ruling against a family therapist that said the law infringes on his constitutional rights and targets his Christian beliefs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWashington state legislators in 2018 passed the law, which subjects health care providers to discipline for attempting to change a minor patient’s sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor medical groups have labeled conversion therapy as a discredited practice that harms LGBTQ+ youth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA federal appeals court this week voted to uphold a Washington state law preventing state-licensed mental health care providers from practicing so-called conversion therapy on minor patients.\n\n\n\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday unanimously upheld the state’s ban on conversion therapy, ruling that the state legislature had acted rationally in 2018 when it passed legislation that bars physicians from seeking to change a minor’s sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n\n\nBrian Tingley, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Washington state, had challenged the law in a complaint filed last year, arguing that it violated his rights under the U.S. Constitution and was “unconstitutionally vague” under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n\nTingley said the law targets his Christian beliefs and has forced him to self-censor. While he does believe that “sexual relationships are beautiful and healthy,” that can only be true if those relationships occur “between one man and one woman committed to each other through marriage.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA district court judge last August dismissed Tingley’s claim, citing a 2014 9th Circuit ruling that upheld a “substantially similar” law in California that subjects state-licensed mental health care providers to discipline for practicing conversion therapy on minors.\n\n\n\nA three-judge panel on Tuesday affirmed that decision.\n\n\n\n“States do not lose the power to regulate the safety of medical treatments performed under the authority of a state license merely because those treatments are implemented through speech rather than through scalpel,” 9th Circuit Judge Ronald Gould wrote Tuesday in the ruling.\n\n\n\nAttorneys for Tingley said they plan to file another appeal, Reuters reported.\n\n\n\n“The government has no business censoring conversations between clients and counselors,” Roger Brooks, one of Tingley’s lawyers, told the outlet.\n\n\n\nWashington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson on Tuesday said the ruling was “another legal victory” for his office in defending the state ban on conversion therapy, which subjects providers to fines or license suspension or revocation for attempting to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of a child younger than 18.\n\n\n\nUnder the law, “conversion therapy” does not include counseling or psychotherapies that “provide acceptance, support and understanding” of young patients or that facilitate healthy coping, social support and identity exploration and development.\n\n\n\nIncluding Washington, 20 states and the District of Columbia have laws or policies in place that ban conversion therapy for minors, and six states have partial bans, according to the Movement Advancement Project, which tracks legislation affecting LGBTQ+ people.\n\n\n\nThree states – Alabama, Georgia and Florida – are located in a federal judicial circuit with an injunction that prevents the enforcement of bans on conversion therapy for minors.\n\n\n\nMajor medical groups have condemned the practice as harmful and say it is based on an “unfounded misconception of sexual orientation and gender identity.”\n\n\n\nAccording to data from the Williams Institute, lesbian, gay and bisexual people in the U.S. that have undergone conversion therapy are nearly twice as likely to report having contemplated suicide.\n\n\n\nThe same study found that 7 percent of lesbian, gay and bisexual adults had experienced conversion therapy at some point in their lives, most of them from religious leaders. Roughly a third said they had received conversion therapy from a health care provider.A study published last year by The Trevor Project, a leading LGBTQ+ youth suicide prevention group, found that 13 percent of LGBTQ+ young people reported being subjected to efforts intended to change their sexual orientation or gender identity, including 83 percent who said they were under 18.",

        "description": "Queen Elizabeth II’s death marks the end of a 70-year era for the United Kingdom and a turning point for British culture and identity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe queen, who was never meant to ascend to the throne, has served through more than 170 prime ministers of the realm and&nbsp;13 U.S. presidents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, she met with Britain’s newest prime minister, Liz Truss, the 16th of the queen’s reign.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere are five big moments from Queen Elizabeth’s decades on the throne: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. (AP)\n\n\n\nAscension to the throne \n\n\n\nThe queen’s ascension to the throne was not originally in the cards for the-then Princess Elizabeth when she was born to the duke and duchess of York in 1926. Her life changed forever after her uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated the throne 10&nbsp;years later, making her father, King George VI, putting her on a direct path to the British throne.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 1952, Elizabeth’s life changed even more drastically when she received news on tour in Kenya that her father unexpectedly died from smoking-related health issues. Soon afterward, she returned to the U.K. as queen.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith her ascension to the throne came a new era for Britain and its empire. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe world was still recovering from World War II and the British Empire was in decline. India, often referred to as the “jewel” in the crown, declared independence from colonial powers five years before the queen’s coronation in 1953. Three years after her coronation, the U.K. withdrew troops from the Suez Canal in Egypt, marking a serious blow to the country’s status as a global power.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut it was the queen’s coronation itself that symbolized a new era for the nation. The ceremony was complete with ancient and religious traditions including the robes, regalia and anointing of the queen with holy oil. The ceremony was also the first to be televised.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn estimated 277 million people around the world tuned in to the event, officially making television a mainstream medium in and out of homes. Today, it is expected that royal events, including weddings, funerals and coronations, are televised.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLike past British monarchs, Elizabeth's reign has seen strife in Ireland. The queen reigned during the Troubles, a roughly three-decade-long sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland between Irish nationalists, who are overwhelmingly Catholic, and pro-British unionists, who are almost exclusively Protestant.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe conflict, which raged from the late 1960s until it was largely ended by a 1998 peace agreement, dealt a deeply personal blow for the royal family when Prince Philip’s uncle, Lord Louis Mountbatten, was killed by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) while out on his fishing boat with his family in the Republic of Ireland.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDespite the tension, the queen made sure she was still a presence in Northern Ireland. She made 25 visits to the country, including three before she ascended the throne. One of her most notable visits took place in 2012, demonstrating how far both sides had moved from the darkest days of the conflict. She met and shook hands with former IRA Commander Martin McGuinness on that occasion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“That remarkable woman has made a great contribution to peace in Ireland,” McGuinness, by then a prominent politician, reportedly said after the meeting. “Shaking hands with me was an important step in cementing the peace process and I hold her in great esteem for doing something that can’t have been easy for her.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrincess Diana and Prince Charles. (AP)\n\n\n\nDiana \n\n\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest challenges for the queen during her reign was Princess Diana’s effect on the public perception of the monarchy. The former princess of Wales revolutionized her role, presenting herself as warmer and more relatable than the rest of the royal family. Additionally, Diana came with star power and celebrity that threatened to overpower the roughly 1,000-year-old institution.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThroughout the course of Diana’s declining marriage and divorce from Prince Charles, the family’s personal dynamics were publicized in an extremely unflattering light. Rumors and coverage of animosity between the couple and extramarital affairs dominated media and tabloid coverage in the late 1980s and early 1990s before the couple separated in 1992. That drama still dominates entertainment media to some extent today. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 1995, Diana made global headlines during a controversial BBC “Panorama” interview in which she divulged details of her troubled relationship with Charles and the royal family as a whole, suggesting the institution of the monarchy viewed her as a threat.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLast year, the BBC apologized after an investigation found that \"deceitful\" measures were used to get Diana to agree to the interview.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, it was Diana’s death in 1997 that proved to be one of the most significant crises seen by the queen during her reign. Despite the widespread outpouring of grief from around the world, the queen did not publicly address Diana’s death until five days after it happened. The queen notably bowed her head to Diana’s coffin as it passed by during the funeral procession, a sign of her respect for the late princess.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe delay in publicly acknowledging Diana’s death initially led to backlash from much British public, but the queen appeared to learn a number of lessons from the tragedy. In the years following Diana’s death, the monarchy revamped its public image. The institution was also made more modern by the coming of age of Charles and Diana’s sons, Prince William and Prince Harry.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBrexit&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe queen reigned during the creation of the European Union in 1993, but later saw the U.K.’s historic exit from the union in 2020.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe queen and the royal family make an effort of staying out of political matters and it remains unclear how she felt about the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union. In 2018, she told the king and queen of the Netherlands that the U.K. is looking “toward a new partnership with Europe.” The following year, she appeared to make another reference to Brexit when she called for “respecting different points of view” and “coming together to seek out the common ground.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“As we look for new answers in the modern age, I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes, like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view; coming together to seek out the common ground; and never losing sight of the bigger picture,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFamily issues continued until the end of her reign&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe twilight of the queen’s reign has been fraught with drama not seen since the 1990s, leading many to question the future of the monarchy without her.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2014, the queen’s son Prince Andrew was accused of having had a sexual relationship with Virginia Giuffre, a minor who was allegedly sex trafficked by American financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. For years Andrew’s friendship and connection with Epstein had drawn criticism.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLater in November of 2019, Andrew gave what many have referred to as an ill-advised interview to the BBC, hoping to clear the air about his friendship and ties to Epstein. However, the interview did just the opposite, effectively tarnishing the prince’s image. In 2020, Andrew stepped back from public duties, and earlier this year, he handed his honorary military affiliations and patronages back to the queen and settled a civil lawsuit from Giuffre out of court.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrince Harry and his wife, Meghan, the duchess of Sussex’s decision to step back from royal duties in 2020 has also had major ramifications on the monarchy. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe couple’s exit from their royal duties has seen a number of revelations about the duchess’s short tenure as a working royal. In March of 2021, the couple took part in a tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey in which they accused the members of the royal fold of racism and mistreatment against the duchess. The allegations reminded many of Diana’s past allegations against the institution, as well as her personal tensions with the queen and members of the royal family.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) ordered flags at the U.S. Capitol to be flown at half-staff to honor Queen Elizabeth II, who died on Thursday at the age of 96.\n\n\n\n“Speaker Pelosi has ordered the flags at the U.S. Capitol to be flown at half-staff due to the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II,” Pelosi spokesperson Drew Hammill wrote on Twitter.\n\n\n\nThe royal family announced the queen’s death on Twitter Thursday afternoon after Buckingham Palace earlier that day said she was “under medical supervision” following evaluation because doctors were “concerned for Her Majesty’s health.”\n\n\n\n“The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon. The King and The Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow,” the royal family wrote.\n\n\n\nElizabeth assumed the role of queen in 1952, when she was 27 years old, after her father’s death. Her reign spanned 15 prime ministers and 14 U.S. presidents, the first being Harry Truman. She met 13 of the 14 American leaders, with the exception of Lyndon Johnson.\n\n\n\nIn May 1991, Queen Elizabeth delivered an address to a joint meeting of Congress, becoming the first British monarch to address the legislative chambers.\n\n\n\nA number of congressional lawmakers released statements on Thursday mourning the Queen’s loss.\n\n\n\n“Today, Americans join the people of the United Kingdom in mourning the sad passing of Queen Elizabeth II,” Pelosi wrote in a statement. “Over her seven decades on the throne, Her Majesty was a pillar of leadership in the global arena and a devoted friend of freedom.&nbsp; On behalf of the United States Congress, I extend our deepest and most sincere condolences to the Royal Family during this sad time.”\n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in a statement said, “The British people’s loss is the entire world’s loss.”\n\n\n\n“Elaine and I extend our deepest sympathies to the Royal Family and to the many millions of people across the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth, and the entire world who have drawn reassurance and inspiration from her historic reign, sterling character, and shining example,” he added.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/defense/3634492-pentagon-watchdog-tells-gop-senators-it-will-evaluate-whistleblower-claims-on-afghan-evacuees/",
        "description": "The Department of Defense’s watchdog told two Republican senators that it will evaluate claims that hundreds of Afghan evacuees were allowed to enter the U.S. despite being on the department’s watchlist.\n\n\n\n“As part of our ongoing body of work on Afghan evacuees, we are initiating an evaluation, to commence in the first quarter of [fiscal year] 2023, to address your questions pertaining to the DoD’s role in reviewing DoD databases for information on Afghan evacuees when requested by other agencies,” acting Pentagon Inspector General Sean O’Donnell wrote in a letter to Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) obtained by The Hill.\n\n\n\nThe evaluation will also look into claims that officials at the National Security Council and Department of Defense “did not follow proper procedures when processing evacuees in Afghanistan and at staging basis.”\n\n\n\nThe development was first reported by Axios.\n\n\n\nThe inspector general’s evaluation is not criminal in nature but comes as the administration faces unanswered questions regarding the evacuation. \n\n\n\nO’Donnell was responding to an Aug. 4 letter from the two senators regarding allegations they received from a Pentagon whistleblower. The senators said the whistleblower had told them that the administration evacuated 324 individuals from Afghanistan who appeared on the agency's watchlist. The whistleblower claimed that those evacuated included “known suspected terrorists.”  \n\n\n\nThe senators also said the person claimed that White House and Defense Department officials directed agency personnel to not conduct fingerprint tests of Afghan evacuees and that Department of Homeland Security staff were authorized to delete old biometric data regardless of whether staff believed the data was out of date.\n\n\n\n“This information may show the Biden Administration’s failure to vet those evacuated from Afghanistan was even worse than the public was led to believe. The following allegations demand an immediate investigation by your office,” the senators said at the time.\n\n\n\nO’Donnell’s letter only addressed the concern about the evacuees entering the U.S. despite being on the Pentagon's watchlist, and he referred their other questions to other agencies.\n\n\n\nThe agency’s evaluation will come as part of its “ongoing body of work” on evacuees. It released two reports regarding Afghan evacuees this year — one evaluation on the screening of Afghan evacuees in February and another audit on the Pentagon’s support for relocating Afghan nationals.\n\n\n\nO’Donnell noted that the agency is also evaluating “security and life support practices for Afghan evacuees at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo.” &nbsp;&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3634493-officials-say-bannon-was-architect-of-defrauding-scheme/",
        "description": "Officials said Steve Bannon was the “architect” of a scheme to defraud donors who gave money to build a wall on the United States-Mexico border.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said at a press conference on Thursday that Bannon and the organization We Build the Wall, Inc., were indicted for a yearlong fundraising scheme that took in more than $15 million from thousands of people across the country based on false pretenses.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe said Bannon and other leaders of the group promised that all donations to the organization would go toward building a wall on the country’s southern border and “not a penny” would go to paying the salary of the group’s president, Brian Kolfage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBragg said the group’s fundraisers repeatedly used the phrase “not a penny” in soliciting donations through media appearances, emails and social media posts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut he said Kolfage received a salary of more than $250,000 that was funded by donations, and at least $140,000 of it was laundered by Bannon. Prosecutors also allege that Bannon used some funds to pay for personal expenses.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBragg said Bannon directed We Build the Wall to transfer tens of thousands of dollars at a time to a non-profit company throughout 2019. The company then paid Kolfage’s salary, which obscured the source of the funds, prosecutors allege.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBragg said prosecutors in New York began investigating Bannon after he received a pardon from former President Trump in January 2021 for federal charges he faced related in relation to the fundraising scheme.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We then began investigating and determined that Mr. Bannon must be held accountable in this jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of New York State, for his conduct as the architect of this scheme, which impacted hundreds of Manhattan residents,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBragg said Bannon and We Build the Wall are facing two counts of second-degree money laundering, two counts of fourth-degree conspiracy, one count of first-degree scheme to defraud and one count of fifth-degree conspiracy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBannon has slammed the investigation as politically motivated, saying that “this is all about 60 days from the day,” referencing the upcoming November midterm elections. He said prosecutors did the “same thing” to him in August 2020 when he faced the federal charges shortly before the 2020 presidential election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBragg said Bannon will be arraigned Thursday afternoon.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwo other men, including Kolfage, pleaded guilty to charges related to the We Build the Wall project in April. A third defendant had a mistrial.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James (D) said at the press conference that the indictment is a result of joint efforts between her office and Bragg’s.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Today is an important day for justice, our justice system and our continued efforts to uphold the law,” she said. “Regular everyday Americans play by these rules, and yet too often, the powerful, political interest, they ignore these rules. They think that they are above the law.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJames said Bannon was the “architect” of Trump’s plan to build a wall on the southern border, so he stole millions of dollars when he undertook a plan to fund the wall.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“And the most egregious of them take advantage of hardworking Americans in the process, and Steve Bannon stands out as a perfect example of this blatant inequality,” she added.",

Ms. Truss was the 15th British prime minister to have an audience with the queen upon taking office, a testament to the longevity of Elizabeth, who served for many Britons as a beacon of stability amid political instability, economic crisis, social unrest and war.”",

Republicans are largely to blame for a situation that has left hundreds of senior government roles vacant. But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and the Democrats have failed to do what they can to make things better.&#8221;\n&#8220;By the end of this week, Joe Biden will have been president for 600 days. During that time, the Senate has confirmed 442 of his nominees for key jobs in the top echelons of government and 78 federal judges, or well under one per day. The problem? There are an additional 140 executive branch nominations and 62 judicial nominations either before the Senate or on their way there. That’s 202 pending nominations, and there are only about 120 days remaining until the 118th Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3.&#8221;",

Quick Phrases — a feature on the Pixel 6 phones, and which Google announced for the Nest Hub Max last year — are now live. This lets the Nest Hub Max (and only the Max so far) respond to certain commands without the phrase “Hey Google,” making talking to the voice interface a little easier.\nAt launch, Quick Phrases — which you need to enable in the Google Home app first — are limited to a few preset commands in four categories: general info (like time and weather), lights, timers, and alarms. Google says the phrases don’t have to be exact and that the Assistant can recognize common variations....\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

In the bottom of the ninth, down 3-2 to the Boston Americans, catcher Billy Sullivan and pinch-hitter Jimmy Callahan singled, and Callahan stole second to put ducks on the pond.

        "description": "Stan Szeto-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Jameson Taillon’s shaky second half has been fueled by a surge in home runs against him. This season has been a tale of two very different halves for Jameson Taillon. In the first three months of the season, the right hander was pitching to a very good 3.24 FIP as part of a Yankees rotation that was on an impressive run as a unit. Taillon was particularly effective when it came to the outcomes he had the most control over; walks and home runs. Through those first three months, Taillon had the lowest walk rate, and notably, was giving up the least amount of long balls relative to his Yankee rotation-mates. However, things have changed since then.\nIn the months since, Taillon is sporting an ERA approaching five, and a FIP that has surpassed it. Noteworthy within that, is the 15 home runs he has given up since the beginning of July — the most in all of baseball. Giving up homers is the single worst thing a pitcher can do on the mound, and doing it more than anyone is quite the issue. Obviously, home runs often come from mistake pitches, but Taillon is also putting himself in positions where he has to throw pitches over the plate.\nOf the league-leading 15 home runs Taillon has given up since the beginning of July, only two were hit when he got himself ahead in the count. Nine of them came on off-speed or breaking pitches. And of those 15, four of them came off his changeup, despite it being his least frequently thrown pitch. \nAs mentioned, the majority of these homers have come when Taillon is even or has fallen behind in the count, which is no coincidence. In those spots of course, a pitcher is generally forced to go at opposing hitters, often resulting in hittable pitches, and in Taillon’s case of late, home runs. This is the most obvious part of this issue, as nearly all of the home runs he’s surrendered have come in these spots. Generally, the righty has been going to his primary pitches, his four-seamer and slider, in these situations. Regardless of his success with them, when he’s falling behind in the count and forced to get a pitch over the plate, it makes the job of the hitter that much easier.\n\nBetween these two differing halves for Taillon on the mound, not a lot has changed as far as his pitch selection goes. He’s throwing his four-seamer and slider a bit more often, his cutter and sinker slightly less often, and his curve and changeup about the same. The results for most have his pitches have been similar too. As far as wOBA goes, there are slight negative trends with some pitches (as expected with a 5.35 FIP since July 1st), but nothing totally eye-popping. There are some massive and concerning shifts however, in the results his changeup is yielding.\nBack in June, I wrote about how well Taillon was mixing and locating his pitch repertoire, noting how effective his change up had been. He has never relied on it, being his least-thrown weapon, but he was picking his spots effectively and finding great success. That of course has not been the case lately, as hitters have posted a .463 wOBA against the pitch since July 1st, up all the way from .255 prior to that. He’s been using the pitch at about the same rate, but lately has been leaving it up in the zone, and it’s getting hammered. \n\nJameson Taillon has not been the pitcher he was in the first half. As the season has progressed, he’s been bitten by the home run bug far too often. The righty has been falling behind in counts, forcing him to go at hitters with his go-to pitches, setting himself up for bad results. And the slight but effective weapon he had in his changeup early in the season has been giving him fits, as he’s been leaving the pitch up in the zone for hitters to pounce on. As the Yankees now find themselves in a more competitive September than anyone would’ve hoped for, getting some semblance the Taillon of the first half back would be a major boost.",

        "description": "Third-party companies have long since supported Google&#8217;s hardware ecosystem with extensible accessories, but one that has risen to the top in both terms of quality and quantity is Wasserstein. Between its Nest and Google TV products, it&#8217;s taken the time and attention to create truly useful &#8220;add-ons&#8221; for your smart home.\n\n\n\nWasserstein is the nation&#x2019;s top smart home accessory manufacturer and&#xA0;is committed to making thoughtful smart home products. Wasserstein is an official Made for Google product partner, and also manufactures solar panels, floodlights, camera mounts, doorbell mounts, and other smart home products, compatible with Ring, Blink, Arlo, Wyze, Oculus, Eufy, Apple, and other popular smart home brands. Wasserstein products can be found on the Wasserstein&#xA0;website, as well as on&#xA0;Amazon,&#xA0;The Home Depot,&#xA0;Walmart,&#xA0;Sam&#x2019;s Club,&#xA0;Best Buy,&#xA0;Target, and other top retail channels.\n\n\n\nToday, the company announced its expansion into offering accessories for Google&#8217;s wearables! Whether you&#8217;re looking to add a screen protector to your Fitbit, clip the device to your side while jogging, or charge up each of your devices in a more compact and gorgeous manner while sitting at home, Wasserstein has got you covered with three new items in its &#8220;Made for Fitbit&#8221; line.\n\n\n\nWasserstein Clip Holder\n\n\nFirst up is its Clip Holder, which is compatible with both the Fitbit Versa 4 and Sense 2. It comes in black and costs $14.99 USD at launch. Once it&#8217;s no longer on sale, it will cost $19.99 USD thereafter, but this launch price makes it a steal.\n\n\n\nThe clip keeps your strapless device safe during a jog, bike ride, or treadmill run among other exercises, and is tailor-made for the aforementioned two units, so it fits snugly around them. It&#8217;s made of silicone, so it doesn&#8217;t stretch or tear easily, and it is simple to clean off if it gets covered in dirt or sweat.\n\n\n\nWasserstein Screen Protector\n\n\nThe second item on offer is the Wasserstein &#8220;Made for Fitbit&#8221; Full Screen protector for your Fitbit Versa 4 or Sense 2. You&#8217;ll receive three protectors in the pack and it will only cost you $15.99 USD. For now, it&#8217;s two bucks off at $13.99 USD. \n\n\n\nSmall and completely transparent, this anti-bubble protection for your watch display prevents cracks and scratches by strengthening its resistance in harsh environments or in case of accidental drops. It also comes with an installation kit, which includes a sticker ring, wet and dry wipes, and a pressing card.\n\n\n\nWasserstein 3-in-1 Charging Station\n\n\nLast, but certainly not least (and quite honestly the accessory I&#8217;m most excited to talk about) is the company&#8217;s 3-in-1 Charging Station. This little stand can sit on your desk and charge not only your Pixel phone (or any type-C handset), but also your Pixel Buds and your Fitbit all while looking gorgeous and compact in the process.\n\n\n\nWhen I empty my pockets after coming home, I generally place my Buds, my Ticwatch, and my Pixel 6 Pro on the desk near one another, but it looks messy and causes some mental fragmentation. With this, all of that disorganized chaos disappears, and your collection of Google wearables can all be presented and stationed nicely in one location.\n\n\n\nThe 3-in-1 Charging Stand is compatible with the Fitbit Sense, Sense 2, Versa 3, Versa 4, and the Charge 5. The USB-C connector is adjustable, so a little wiggle while plugging your phone in or taking it off of the stand won&#8217;t cause damage. \n\n\n\nIf you have a Moto G, Samsung Galaxy, or any other USB-C phone or pair of earbuds, you can also use Wasserstein&#8217;s accessory. The only reason it&#8217;s being marketed as a fit for Google&#8217;s products is that the company has decided to go all in on supporting Google and its hardware and has become an official partner.\n\n\n\nOne thing you&#8217;ll want to know before purchasing any of these items, however, is that the Clip Holder ships at the end of September, and the 3-in-1 Charging Stand ships in October. The only other bummer is the price of the stand itself, as it comes in at a cool $89.99 USD! You can grab it now for $74.99 USD, but that&#8217;s quite the investment. If you&#8217;re looking for a sexy, sleek dock to house all of your stuff, it may well be worth that investment, but it depends on who you ask. I will say though that if you&#8217;re excited about Google&#8217;s new and upcoming Pixel Watch, then Wasserstein&#8217;s dock would pair nicely with it.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  LA’s last four years have produced the lowest OBP allowed in MLB history A couple of weeks ago, scrolling through Twitter, this particularly impressive statement came across my timeline, and it was eye-popping. It’s pretty well known that the Dodgers have been the best team in baseball since Andrew Friedman took over control of baseball operations, and while all phases of the game have produced well, the pitching staff has been the backbone of the entire team.\nThe Dodgers have been dominant on the mound, occupying the leaderboards in most pitching categories for the last five years or so, and this bit of information really puts this run into perspective.\n\n\nThe only four teams in all of American and National League history to hold opponents under a .280 OBP:2019 Los Angeles Dodgers (.279)2020 Los Angeles Dodgers (.273)2021 Los Angeles Dodgers (.279)2022 Los Angeles Dodgers (.270) pic.twitter.com/KCrlarOyRG— Codify (@CodifyBaseball) August 26, 2022\n\n\n\nThough Wednesday, the Dodgers’ 2022 on-base percentage allowed is at .275 (still in that top 4)\nLooking at the entire history of baseball, not only does this four-year run between 2019 and 2022 represents the lowest OBP allowed by a pitching staff, but each individual year is in the top four ever. No team ever has done it any better.\nNow, does this mean that the Dodgers have the best four-year run of pitching of all time? Maybe, maybe not. It is one handpicked stat that lines up that way, and you can always nitpick different things, but that’s truly beside the point, which is that what this pitching staff has been doing is remarkable.\nThere are a few different aspects of this record-breaking run that should be touched on, and that’s what we’ll do right here.\nYou’re only as strong as your weakest link\nThere are a good number of aces around Major League Baseball. The Dodgers aren’t the only pitching staff with a one-two punch of the quality of Julío Urías and Clayton Kershaw. What makes this team so successful, and it has worked to a different level to the Tampa Bay Rays in recent memory as well, is the fact that they simply do not run many liabilities out there.\nEvery starter one through five, and even those that come in for spot starts in the midst of a run of consecutive games without a day off, or to fill in because of injury, every single one of them delivers a quality outing, even if not ace-like.\nDid you know that the two worst seasons by a Dodgers starter with at least 10 starts since 2019 belong to that year’s Kenta Maeda, who had a 102 ERA+ and 1.074 WHIP, and Walker Buehler in this season with a 104 ERA+. David Price also had a 102 ERA+ in 2021, but a number of his 11 starts were of the bullpen-game variety.\nThe only Dodgers pitcher to make a decent chunk of starts and provide a below-league-average ERA in the past four seasons has been Ross Strippling who had a 5.61 ERA over 33⅔ innings and seven starts in 2020 before getting traded away.\nThis team’s ability to utilize their resources and maximize the quality of not only their 26-man roster, but the 40-man as well, is what puts this organization into perennial contention in the NL West, and it plays a role in the second point.\nQuality depth makes up for the lack of overlapping\nA four-year period is quite long, but not enough to provide such a diversity in terms of different pitchers with successful production, at least it shouldn’t be for most teams, but it is exactly the case for the 2019-22 Dodgers.\nThis period coincides with the return of Urías from shoulder surger, the establishment of Buehler as a front-line starter, and the beginning of a different Kerhsaw. Those three have clearly been the backbone of this whole pitching staff since then, but neither one of them has truly been a mainstay in all four campaigns.\nUrías didn’t really start full-time until 2020, Buehler will now miss the majority of the 2022 season, and Kershaw while present in every season has also missed time consistently over the last two years, and will likely hover around 40 starts since the beginning of last year by the end of September.\nIn 2019, Rich Hill and Hyun Jin Ryu were the two most dominant pitchers on the staff. Granted, Hill only made 13 starts, but he had a 2.45 ERA, and Ryu led the team in both innings and ERA (182⅔ and 2.32, respectively).\nDustin May had an impressive rookie campaign, pitching to a 170 ERA+ in 2020, trailing only Kershaw’s 202 mark on the team.\nMax Scherzer only had half a season with the team, but he was as great as anyone since MVP Kershaw in this Dodger uniform.\nTony Gonsolin has emerged as a Cy Young candidate in 2022, but even his previous form in the past two years had been well above average, and Tyler Anderson has been another great surprise.\nOverall, all of these pitchers have contributed impressive numbers which ultimately add up to one of the elite staffs we’ve ever seen over the last half a decade.\nA bullpen built on under-the-radar finds and high investments\nHaving the biggest budget in the sport helps in more ways than can be described, and one of them is the ability to invest heavily in the bullpen without jeopardizing or sacrificing other areas on the roster.\nThe bulk of the Dodgers’ pen has been built on two types of acquisition in recent years.\nBig investments in established veterans via free agency.\nThe Dodgers have signed Blake Treinen, Joe Kelly, and Daniel Hudson in the past few years, and they all got significant contracts but didn’t really affect the team’s budget like it would with other mid-market clubs.\nEven Craig Kimbrel falls into this fold because the Dodgers didn’t sell the farm to bring him on, and instead opened up room to play Gavin Lux every day by sending AJ Pollock to the White Sox.\nSince Friedman has taken over the helm, the Dodgers have basically been allergic to trading valuable prospects for the big-name relievers.\nFinding raw talent and developing it\nNames like Phil Bickford, Alex Vesia, Dylan Floro, and perhaps the biggest success story of the bunch in Evan Phillips, have come onboard as relative unknowns and been able to absolutely flourish with a few tweaks to maximize what they can do well.\nConclusion\nThe Dodgers have managed to build sustainable success that looks almost impervious to injuries and setbacks. Nothing is infallible, but this operation is about as close as you can come to it in a baseball team, and it all starts and ends with quality depth, from your best starter to the bottom of your 40-man roster.",

But Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo were ahead of that curve by nearly 50 years.The Trocks, as they’re known, are an all-male troupe founded in New York in the 1970s who dance classical ballerina roles in pointe shoes and tutus. They perform with serious technique alongside high camp and slapstick hilarity; they adore ballet and relish skewering its tropes and traditions. They are somehow both a very niche concern – referencing an obscure Soviet ballet or mocking the specifics of a particular piece of choreography – and purveyors of the broadest humour and appeal. Who doesn’t enjoy a symphony of pratfalls and perfectly timed mistakes?At the Peacock theatre, London, until 10 September, followed by a second programme, 12-17 September. Then touring.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3634627-biden-on-queen-elizabeth-she-defined-an-era/",
        "description": "President Biden and first lady Jill Biden honored Queen Elizabeth II on Thursday, calling her “a steadying presence” and “a stateswoman of unmatched dignity” following her death.\n\n\n\n“In a world of constant change, she was a steadying presence and a source of comfort and pride for generations of Britons, including many who have never known their country without her. An enduring admiration for Queen Elizabeth II united people across the Commonwealth,” Biden said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe queen died at the age of 96, ending the longest reign for a British head of state in history that included the administrations of 14 U.S. presidents. She died at Balmoral Castle, her Scottish estate, Buckingham Palace announced.\n\n\n\nBiden had been briefed on the queen’s health earlier on Thursday and was receiving regular updates about her condition. The Bidens first met the queen in 1982 while on a Senate delegation trip to the U.K. and met with her in June 2021 when she hosted them during an overseas trip.\n\n\n\nBiden, in his statement, commented that she deepened the special relationship between the U.S. and UK.\n\n\n\n“Queen Elizabeth II was a stateswoman of unmatched dignity and constancy who deepened the bedrock Alliance between the United Kingdom and the United States. She helped make our relationship special,” he said.\n\n\n\n“She helped Americans commemorate both the anniversary of the founding of Jamestown and the bicentennial of our independence. And she stood in solidarity with the United States during our darkest days after 9/11, when she poignantly reminded us that ‘Grief is the price we pay for love’,” he added.\n\n\n\nBiden said he and the first lady look forward to a close relationship with the new King and Queen Consort and sent his condolences to their whole family. He spoke with British Prime Minister Liz Truss during a video call with other leaders earlier on Thursday and told her he was thinking of the queen.\n\n\n\n“Her legacy will loom large in the pages of British history, and in the story of our world,” he said in his statement.\n\n\n\nBiden noted that the queen led the U.K. through the COVID-19 pandemic and spoke about the personal connection people felt with her during her life of service.\n\n\n\n“She was the first British monarch to whom people all around the world could feel a personal and immediate connection — whether they heard her on the radio as a young princess speaking to the children of the United Kingdom, or gathered around their televisions for her coronation, or watched her final Christmas speech or her Platinum Jubilee on their phones,” he said.\n\n\n\n“And she, in turn, dedicated her whole life to their service,” he added.",

So not only was there the big lie; there was the big rip-off,” Rep.&nbsp;Zoe Lofgren&nbsp;(D-Calif.) said at one of the Jan. 6 committee’s hearings.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSave America also sent off a barrage of fundraising emails last month after the FBI’s execution of a search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago resort — where agents found more than 100 classified documents and dozens of empty folders&nbsp;marked as classified.\n\n\n\nFundraising exceeded $1 million at least two days after the search, according to the Washington Post. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"The lawlessness, political persecution, and Witch Hunt, must be exposed and stopped,\" Trump wrote in a fundraising email, an excerpt of which was shared by Reuters.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department's grand jury has more legal power in its probe than the House select committee, but it remains unclear whether it will bring charges against the former president.",

        "description": "The Biden administration announced a new goal to make the use of geothermal energy — renewable energy that comes from heat that’s inside the earth — “widespread” as it seeks to transition away from fossil fuels.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Energy Department said it hopes to cut the costs of geothermal energy systems by 90 percent by 2035. \n\n\n\nThe department said that capturing even a “small fraction” of the U.S.’s geothermal resources could power more than 40 million homes.\n\n\n\n“The United States has a vast, geothermal energy resource lying right beneath our feet, and this program will make it economical to bring that power to American households and businesses,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSpecifically, the Energy Department will invest in research and development for geothermal energy. Geothermal energy can be used to heat buildings, as well as in electricity generation, food dehydrating, gold mining and milk pasteurizing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe announcement follows similar initiatives aimed at bolstering the deployment of other emerging energy technologies like clean hydrogen energy and batteries.",

        "description": "A large majority of Americans favor a maximum age limit for elected officials, a new CBS News/YouGov poll found.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if there should be an upper age restriction at which point lawmakers are forced to leave office, 73 percent of poll respondents agreed. Only 27 percent of those surveyed did not agree with the idea.\n\n\n\nThe majority across all political parties polled were in favor of the maximum age limit, with 71 percent of Democrats, 75 percent of Republicans and 75 percent of independents supporting it.\n\n\n\nThe majority support also held through every age group of respondents.\n\n\n\nMost of those polled (40 percent) said 70 would be an appropriate cut-off age. The other ages offered were age 50 (8 percent), age 60 (26 percent), age 80 (18 percent) and age 90 (2 percent).\n\n\n\nCurrently, the oldest members of Congress are 87-year-old Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).

        "description": "Queen Elizabeth II’s longevity alone places her in the pantheon of royal greats. At the time of her death, at Balmoral Castle today, she had served 70 years as Queen—the longest of any sovereign in the English monarchy’s 1,000-year history. But it is not simply her longevity that marks her for greatness, but her ability to stay relevant as the world changed around her.She was the product of ancestral inheritance but was more popular than any of her prime ministers and remained head of state in countries around the world because of public support. She was in a sense a democratic Queen, a progressive conservative, an aristocratic multiculturalist.Queen Elizabeth was a constitutional monarch, not a political leader with real powers, and one who was required to serve an ever-changing set of realms, peoples, institutions, and ideas that were no longer as obviously compatible as they had been when she ascended to the throne. The Queen’s great achievement was to honor the commitment she made to an imperial nation and its empire as a princess even as it became a multiethnic state and a Commonwealth.When the Queen devoted her whole life to the service of Britain’s “great imperial family,” she meant it and honored it. And she did so in a way that brought more harmony than discord. Even as her nation’s influence shrank, the world embraced her.\r\nQueen Elizabeth II during a Commonwealth visit to the Caribbean, March 1966 (Express / Hulton Archive / Getty)\r\n1. The Global IntroductionIn October 1940, a teenage Princess Elizabeth gave the first of what would be a lifetime of public speeches designed to move, embolden, and steady the nerves of an imperiled empire. At the time, the British empire was standing alone against Nazi Germany: France had been crushed, the Soviet Union had made a deal with Hitler, and the United States remained aloof from World War II. Elizabeth and her sister, Margaret, had traveled with their parents to record a message for the BBC that would be broadcast to “the children of the empire,” as well as children in the U.S.The recording offers a glimpse of a time and place that is gone, as well as the first look at this representative of a new age, the age of Elizabeth. Hers would be an age not of world war and European empires, but of imperial retreat and American expansion; of the Cold War and the apparent end of history; of nationalism and globalization; of the space race and the internet.For the 14-year-old princess, none of this was visible that day in 1940. The world that existed then faced the prospect of a Nazi-dominated Europe. Ostensibly, her message was to the children evacuated to the British countryside and to the Greater Britain that then existed beyond the seas, to evade German aerial bombardment of cities. In her clipped but childish tones, the young Elizabeth marvels at the lives being led in these far-flung corners of the world. “All the new sights you must be seeing, and the adventures you must be having,” she says, as if reading an exciting bedtime story. But then she turns to the central thrust of the message: a plea. “I am sure that you, too, are often thinking of the Old Country. I know you won’t forget us.”[Read: How The Crown, and its clothes, transform power]Here was the vulnerability at the core of Princess Elizabeth’s address. The Old Country was in trouble and needed help. Princess Elizabeth had been enlisted to ask for it, to do her duty—a task she would perform for decades to come.During her reign, she weathered an array of crises, from her clashes with Margaret Thatcher to her mishandling of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. In doing so, she became the focus of something akin to a secular religion, the royalist historian David Starkey has noted, a form of “British Shintoism,” according to others such as Philip Murphy, a professor of British and Commonwealth history at the University of London.Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born on April 21, 1926, as a princess to not simply a king but an emperor. She became Queen to a multitude of realms. A child of empire, European supremacy, and the old order—even the old faith, Anglican Christianity—she came to see it as her solemn duty to represent all the peoples and religions of the Commonwealth.This duty created friction during her reign, but it made her different from any other European monarch and, paradoxically, kept her modern. A great irony of Queen Elizabeth II is that the most penetrating criticism of her reign came not from the republican left but from the nationalist right, parts of which saw past her image of continuity and tradition to the deep change that her rule actually represented.2. The VowOn Princess Elizabeth’s 21st birthday, she delivered a radio broadcast that would define her life. Addressing all “the peoples of the British Commonwealth and Empire,” and specifically “the youth of the British family of nations,” she asked for their permission to speak as their representative. Delivered from Cape Town, South Africa, this was not a message to England, or Britain, or even the United Kingdom, but to the already fading empire.The message was designed to inspire, but also to begin a transition. The princess declared that just as England had saved Europe from Napoleonic domination in the 19th century, the British empire had saved the world from Hitler in the 20th. The task now before the empire was just as pressing, she said: It needed to save itself.“If we all go forward together with an unwavering faith, a high courage, and a quiet heart,” Elizabeth said, “we shall be able to make of this ancient commonwealth, which we all love so dearly, an even grander thing.” In doing so, the princess, with a politician’s sleight of hand, had endowed a relatively new construct, the British Commonwealth, with the myth of ancient roots. “I declare before you all,” she continued, “that my whole life whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.”In 1947, such a commitment could still be made without embarrassment. Formally, India, the jewel in the British imperial crown, was not yet independent, though the legal process was under way and would become reality within months. The last vestiges of royal connection to Ireland had similarly not yet been cut. Soon, however, this apparently “ancient” family would undergo a revolution.[Read: The first Brexit was theological]In the early hours of February 6, 1952, King George VI, Elizabeth’s father, died in his sleep. She was in Kenya when she learned that she had become Queen. Prime Minister Winston Churchill broadcast the news, describing the Crown as “the magic link, which unites our loosely bound but strongly interwoven commonwealth of nations.” And yet, just five years after Elizabeth’s Cape Town address, the world had already changed to such an extent that to speak of a great imperial family, as Elizabeth had done, was no longer appropriate. By 1952, for example, India was not only independent, but a republic. This new Commonwealth comprised free and equal countries that voluntarily accepted Elizabeth as their symbolic head—a role with no real power for an organization with no real status.She was Queen, then, but of what?Her father had been crowned George VI of “Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas,” as well as “Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India.” By the time the young Elizabeth was crowned, the title “Emperor of India” was obsolete. Yet even this did not go far enough. She was proclaimed Queen Elizabeth II, “Queen of this Realm and of all Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.”Although few paid much attention to the changes at the time, the new terminology caught the eye of one of the most influential and controversial British politicians of the postwar era, Enoch Powell. He had spotted that the new declaration contained within it imperial retreat and was dismayed. But this was not the real source of his fury—it was that Britain had been subsumed into a multinational structure that it no longer led. In Britain, Elizabeth would be “Queen of the United Kingdom,” but elsewhere she would have different titles, granted by different countries: Queen of Australia in Australia, Queen of Canada in Canada, and so forth.What Powell had seen was that this marked a sea change not only for the Queen, but for Britain itself. What had been a single empire with a single sovereign was no longer—nor was it even a British Commonwealth. In its place was simply a Commonwealth with different peoples, each equal to the others, including that of the Old Country, whether or not they took the Queen as their monarch.In 1947, Princess Elizabeth had declared that she would give her whole life to the service of Britain’s great imperial family. When she became Queen, it was no longer clear what that really meant.\r\nQueen Elizabeth II meets with local children and residents of Malacca state during a Commonwealth visit by members of the British royal family to Malaysia in March 1972.

In 1948, Parliament had passed legislation revolutionizing the nature of British nationality itself, creating several separate citizenships within the empire. What had been a Greater Britain around the world, singular and indivisible, loyal to the King and empire, was no more. It had shrunk, leaving space for Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand nationalisms to flourish as separate identities, just as a Scotsman today can also be British.The Queen’s title, therefore, was a sign of the coming age, a beacon in the fog of the 1950s lighting the way to the postimperial world that exists today.For the ordinary Brit at home, glued to the television to watch the Queen’s coronation, much of this passed unnoticed. As Vernon Bogdanor writes in The Monarchy and the Constitution, the feelings of attachment to Britain in its former dominions, such as New Zealand and Canada, were taken for granted. In 1953, Australia’s prime minister, R. G. Menzies, spoke of the Queen passing on “a crown that will always be the sign and proof that, wherever we may be in the world, we are one people.” Menzies had in 1948 even said that “the boundaries of Britain do not lie on the Kentish Coast, they are to be found at Cape York and Invercargill.”[From the December 1943 issue: The education of a queen]Indeed, on the occasion of Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, there seemed little reason to doubt the strength of this great global nation. The day before, the New Zealander Edmund Hillary had conquered Mount Everest with Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, planting the Union Jack on its peak. Welcoming the news, New Zealand’s prime minister declared how proud he was that an Englishman had been the ﬁrst to climb the world’s highest mountain. During the Queen’s first royal tour of the Commonwealth, in 1953–54, she visited 13 countries, including Bermuda, Jamaica, Sri Lanka, Australia, and New Zealand, covering more than 40,000 miles in six months. In Australia, 6–7 million people turned out to see her, amounting to about 75 percent of the country’s population.Only now is it possible to see the slow unwinding of this Greater British identity during the age of Elizabeth. An early glimpse came during her first visit to India and Pakistan as Queen, in 1961. Despite being head of the Commonwealth, of which India was a member, the Queen was invited only in her capacity as Queen of the United Kingdom. To do otherwise might have implied “the existence in some degree of authority residing in Her Majesty over the Republic of India,” Philip Murphy points out in Monarchy and the End of Empire. When the Commonwealth bumped up against the hard reality of Britain’s place in the postimperial world, there was no question that the Commonwealth had to stand aside.It was scarcely appreciated then, but the Queen’s coronation—that great triumph of Britishness at the peak of its powers—was what signified the retreat. A moment of deep continuity for the Old Country was actually a moment of quiet revolution, turning Britain inward and setting a course that it would travel for the rest of her reign, culminating in a threat to the very future of Britain by the time of her death, with support for secession growing in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.Britons did not know it at the time of her ascent, but they were once again an island people. Only their Queen was global.4. The ReignIn retrospect, it was absurd to think that the Queen could be both British and global, sharing herself equally among her various realms. How can one person be Queen of the United Kingdom one moment and Queen of Australia the next, as well as head of a Commonwealth? In time, the practical reality revealed itself—the Queen was primarily Queen of the United Kingdom.From 1952 to her death, she would meet 13 of the 14 U.S. presidents elected in that time (Lyndon B. Johnson being the exception). She did so as Britain’s head of state—in effect, Queen of the Old Country hiding in imperial clothes, representing a state that, in U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson’s infamous put-down, had lost an empire but not yet found a role.[Read: The Queen Mother’s odd letters]Through the 1960s and early ’70s, following Britain’s humiliation at Suez, the country sought to tilt away from the empire toward its special relationship with the United States and membership in the new European Community. Globally, this shift in priorities meant sacrificing imperial power for imagined influence over the new empire that had replaced Britain: the United States. In Europe, it meant sacrificing trade with the Commonwealth for markets on its doorstep. For many in Britain, this was a hard choice, given support for the old imperial connections, particularly to the Greater British dominions (or, more cynically, to the white Commonwealth) of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.Yet successive British governments knew which direction they wanted to go in. In Africa, for example, Britain, unlike France, encouraged its former colonies not only to become independent, but to become republics. The loss of the empire was seen as a price worth paying for greater influence, and the Queen supported recognition of African nationalism. In 1960, when British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan remarked in a speech from South Africa that the “wind of change is blowing through this continent,” signaling the inevitability of decolonization, Elizabeth “took the unusual step of indicating her personal approval of Macmillan’s words,” Murphy records. Shortly after the speech, Macmillan received a telegram with a message from London that “the Queen was very interested and much impressed by the Prime Minister’s speech.” Four years later, the process of decolonization in East, West, and Central Africa was largely complete.However, tensions between her role as global Queen and national Queen were inevitable—and duly came. Because the Queen was atop neither an empire nor an international body with a constitution like, say, the European Union, her title as head of the Commonwealth was unclear, unwritten, and, crucially, unlinked to her position as head of state in Britain or anywhere else. What happened if her two roles clashed?\r\nQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip wave to the crowd while on their Commonwealth visit to Australia, 1954. (Fox Photos / Hulton Archive / Getty)\r\nIn 1952, when the British dominions were part of an imagined Greater Britain or—outside the Indian subcontinent—the subjects of a still-vast empire, there was little scope for such a clash. By the 1960s, as the empire continued to be swept away, there was a very real prospect of friction.The danger, as Powell had pointed out, was that in creating the fiction of the Commonwealth, the Queen risked losing the support of her people at home by appearing to have split loyalties. As the 1960s turned into the ’70s and ’80s, this prophecy seemed to be coming true. In an article in 1964, Powell spoke of the resentment of British people seeing their sovereign “playing an alien part as one of the characters in the Commonwealth charade.” The imperial monarchy, to which the Queen had devoted her life, appeared to be threatening the national monarchy.Tensions really began to be felt when the Conservative Party in Britain elected as its leader a Powellite in the form of Margaret Thatcher, who seemed to have little time for the Commonwealth and even less sympathy for the policies of some of its more radical members. According to Murphy’s Monarchy and the End of Empire, Thatcher and her closest advisers joked that the acronym CHOGM—for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting—stood for “Compulsory Hand-Outs for Greedy Mendicants.”In the Queen’s 1983 Christmas message, four years after Thatcher came to power, she appeared to champion the policies of India’s prime minister, Indira Gandhi, over those of her own government, adding that despite the progress that had been made on the subcontinent, “the greatest problem in the world today remains the gap between rich and poor countries, and we shall not begin to close this gap until we hear less about nationalism and more about interdependence.”[From the magazine: How to write about royalty]This was not a message from the Thatcherite script and its Cold War mentality. Powell said that the intervention suggested the Queen had “the interests and affairs of other countries in other continents as much, or more, at heart than those of her own people.”Another clash between the global and national Queen came in 1986, when a number of countries were threatening to boycott the Commonwealth Games in protest of Thatcher’s opposition to sanctions against apartheid South Africa. Britain had been isolated on the issue, with the Queen notably avoiding taking Britain’s side. Sonny Ramphal, the Guyanese Commonwealth secretary-general, later recalled that “if the Queen hadn’t been there we might have gone on the rocks.”Later that year, a series of articles began to appear in the British press revealing a rift between the Queen and her prime minister over the Commonwealth. A profile of Prince Charles in The Economist suggested that his views were considerably to the left of Thatcher’s. An article in the newspaper Today then suggested that the Queen was worried the division over sanctions could break up the Commonwealth, and had even urged Thatcher to change her views. Similar pieces appeared in The Times and The Daily Telegraph. Finally, The Sunday Times led its front page with the headline “Queen Dismayed by ‘Uncaring’ Thatcher,” calling her “The African Queen.”Such revelations, which came close to constitutional-crisis territory, centered on the Queen’s split loyalties to Commonwealth and nation. Powell had warned that this split would make her look more concerned for the Commonwealth than for Britain. The Queen had become a champion of global multiculturalism at home and abroad. Almost by accident, she had become modern.5. The LegacyIn some senses, Queen Elizabeth II leaves an ambiguous legacy. She stands above almost all of Britain’s British monarchs, but was one who oversaw a drastic shrinkage in the monarchy’s power, prestige, and influence. Such a legacy, however, does not do the Queen justice.At the funeral of the former Israeli leader Shimon Peres in 2016, then–U.S. President Barack Obama likened him to some of the “other giants of the 20th century.” Obama, whose father was a Kenyan government official born in what was then part of the British empire, chose to name two figures: Nelson Mandela and Queen Elizabeth II.The Queen’s role in the Commonwealth might have been a device to hide the reality of the British empire’s decline, but she did not believe so. The irony is that in doing her duty to this imperial shadow in the same way she did her duty to Britain, she was better able to symbolize a modern, multicultural Britain and the world of the 21st century than logic might suggest was possible for an aristocratic European princess. Indeed, she is more popular in many African Commonwealth countries today than the former white dominions, which may soon choose to become republics and long ago stopped seeing themselves as British.Yet her death has given rise to a sense of unease. Her eldest son, Charles, seems an unlikely figure for the British Shintoism that built up around his mother. Whatever his merits, such has been the nature of his life, lived in the glare of the modern world—of Diana and Camilla, The Crown and the tabloids—that it looks impossible to re-create the kind of worship that attached itself to the Queen.[Read: What Meghan Markle means for the royal family]Generations have known nothing but the Queen. She became almost above reproach, an icon on a wall, a symbol. Charles, by contrast, is human and flawed and distinctly reproachable. With the Queen goes the monarchy’s protective shield. Can the next generation escape the tarnish of racism leveled by Harry and Meghan, or the scandals of Prince Andrew?Beyond Britain, will Australia and New Zealand and Canada accept Charles as their King, as they did Elizabeth in 1952? And what of the Queen’s other great love, the Commonwealth? It has already agreed to let Charles inherit his mother’s leadership. But how long can such an institution really survive? In an era of Black Lives Matter and imperial guilt, can an African child once again be pictured kneeling before some distant European monarch, as happened for the Queen’s diamond jubilee, in 2012?None of these questions is answerable for now. Much rests on Charles himself. Can he show the lifelong restraint of his mother, the dignity and duty, the reserve and careful calculation? Will events blow him off course?When King George VI died, Winston Churchill paid tribute to him in the House of Commons, before turning to his new Queen. “So far I have spoken of the past, but with the new reign we must all feel our contact with the future,” the prime minister said. “She comes to the throne at a time when a tormented mankind stands uncertainly poised between world catastrophe and a golden age.” For Churchill, such a golden age was possible only with “a true and lasting peace.” He then concluded: “Let us hope and pray that the accession to our ancient throne of Queen Elizabeth II may be the signal for such a brightening salvation of the human scene.”Looking back on her reign, it is clear that the age of Elizabeth really was golden: an age of extraordinary prosperity, European peace, human rights, and the collapse of Soviet tyranny. Queen Elizabeth II—the Queen—was one of the great symbols of that age, though not a creator of it, a servant rather than a master. But if her legacy is anything, it is that symbols and service matter, even as what they symbolize and serve bend and bow to meet the new reality.",

        "description": "I cradled my first iPhone like an egg after I bought it. The year was 2011; the season was winter. The ground was slushy, but I was too nervous to take the thing on the subway. It was an absolute luxury, by far the fanciest and, I felt, most fragile thing I owned—more Fabergé than farmstand.The precise model was the iPhone 4, which looked like an ice-cream sandwich from the side and felt about as sturdy. I wasn’t just concerned about slipping and dropping the thing: It was dark, I was in a crusty part of New York, and I looked like I got scared at Death Cab for Cutie shows—would someone punch me in the face and yank it? The iPhone was relatively uncommon back then; BlackBerry—the traditionalist’s choice—was still more popular, but both were outnumbered by Android. Nokia was trouncing them all. Most Americans didn’t have a smartphone, and many had no mobile phone at all.In a market generally defined by boring hunks of plastic, Apple gained an edge through impeccable design that was actually less functional than most of the competition. Many reviewers rightly pointed out that the touch screen was worse to type on than a physical keyboard, and complained about the iPhone’s fragility. In these early years, buying one was the fashionable choice, not the pragmatic one. It was cool.How things have changed. As of this summer, for the first time ever, more Americans now use an iPhone than use an Android phone. Toddlers handle them while sitting in strollers. Parents handle them while pushing strollers. For a time during the pandemic, the Kardashians ripped through them on a weekly basis to film their show without risking exposure to a film crew. There’s no mystique, no scarcity, and not much in terms of novelty. The iPhone is like a tote bag with a few cameras: a utilitarian default.[Read: People aren’t meant to talk this much]That’s not to say people won’t buy new ones, of course. Quite the contrary. This week, Apple unveiled its latest iPhone models: the iPhone 14, the iPhone 14 Plus, the iPhone 14 Pro, and the iPhone 14 Pro Max. They’re quite similar to last year’s, and the previous year’s, and the year before that, and indeed the year prior. By now, the routine is familiar; every year, Apple ships a couple hundred million phones to be purchased by perhaps millions of people enrolled in the company’s annual upgrade program, and by many others who are not. These phones are expensive—$800 and up—and certainly not everyone can afford them. But Apple sidesteps this hurdle with its upgrade program, which converts the up-front cost into a monthly loan payment.That’s a big part of the problem in a nutshell: The system erected around annual upgrades means that many, many people buy the iPhone and then live their life quite literally indebted to Apple, which is better than its competitors at locking people into a “walled garden”—or, as the writer Cory Doctorow has called it, a “feedlot.” What was once a bold consumer choice is now more like a sad dip into the trough.I wouldn’t have predicted any of this on that cold walk home, and not just because I couldn’t imagine ever being in a position to upgrade from my beautiful new device. A few months prior to my big purchase, in 2010, Gizmodo paid $5,000 to acquire a lost prototype of the iPhone 4—that same one I would eventually hold so gingerly—and published all of its secrets before Apple could announce them. This iPhone felt extremely new and exciting, even after Apple made it all official: the first one with a selfie camera! FaceTime! A Retina display! And … a gyroscope? Great. Apple eventually called it the iPhone that changed everything again, and it was right. The marketing matched the delivery and people went ballistic, lining up by the thousands, and digital storefronts struggled to keep up.The iPhone 14, meanwhile, with a suite of incremental and frankly boring improvements, is the iPhone that will change nothing. This isn’t a knock on Apple, exactly. It’s a credit to the company for which, where iPhone quality is concerned, the scale slides from “very good” to “very, very good.” But the iPhone’s predictability is a sign of the shifting cultural landscape around the device—and the changes in attitudes brought on in part by Apple’s own innovations. Where the iPhone once symbolized verve, it now evokes crushing inevitability. The company will produce, the people will consume, and the waste will pile up (and up and up). Don’t let the branding deceive you: With the introduction of the latest devices, Apple has now forged 38 distinct models of iPhone since 2007, once all the Pluses, Maxes, Minis, and SEs are accounted for.[Read: Why the past 10 years of American life have been uniquely stupid]We’re swamped in phones, and the malaise many people feel about technology billows up from their screens. Too many Americans have been forced to rely on smartphones for want of better internet options during the pandemic. Polls show that the majority of us see big problems in the services they’re a gateway to: Social-media toxicity, misinformation, data harvesting, abuse. The iPhone’s pixels illuminate the Instagram post that gives you FOMO, the YouTube video that makes your uncle doubt the vaccine, the NFTs that sell for millions, and the tweet instructing you to log off forever. Bo Burnham was right when he described the internet as “a little bit of everything all of the time”—digital life has become a bit samey and numbing. It makes sense that the iPhone would follow suit; everything is formatted to fit its screen.To an extent, these problems are out of Apple’s hands. And certainly, plenty of iPhone owners blissfully don’t fret about them. Still, Apple’s products can’t exist in a vacuum: Just as the company proved itself capable of nuking Facebook’s ad business with a change to its privacy features, it has to know that its new hardware will shape the world it’s born into. That world is dark, and where once a new iPhone seemed to brighten it, it feels like the 14 series is leaning all the way in. The iPhone 14 Pro’s screens are now “Always On,” as if in concession to our terminal affliction. And—this is real—there’s a new “Emergency SOS” feature, which will allow an iPhone 14 to connect to a satellite and call for help if you’re lost or trapped, a victim of a crime, or imperiled by fire. Apple promoted this with a video of a woman summoning rescue helicopters from a wooded mountaintop. It felt futuristic and kind of awful, which is a nice representation of where we’re at. (As Buzzfeed News’ Katie Notopoulos eloquently put it, “I’m Pretty Sure Apple Knows We’re All Going to Die Soon.”)It makes sense. Having wrung so much value out of the Earth with so many new gizmos created every single year—did you know that humanity produces more than 59 million tons of electronic waste annually?—Big Tech is looking to the stars for its new ideas. Maybe there’s nowhere else to go. Meanwhile, we’re all down here shuffling through the rubble. Pick your head up from time to time and wave hello to your neighbor: They probably have an iPhone.",

They reinstated Mike Brosseau from the IL, optioned Esteury Ruiz to the minors, and designated Justin Topa as today’s 29th man.\nMike Brosseau was placed on the IL on August 23 due to a right oblique strain. He’s been playing off the bench for most of the season, batting .258/.341/.417 in 58 games this season. Meanwhile, Esteury Ruiz was called up at the start of September. He only appeared in 3 games and started 2 of them. In those games, he went 0-for-8 with 1 walk.\nMeanwhile, Justin Topa joins the team today as the 29th man for the doubleheader. He’s spent most of the season rehabbing from an elbow injury, and was finally activated and optioned to Nashville last month. In 16 appearances with Nashville, he’s recorded a 3.50 ERA with 16 strikeouts and 8 walks in 18 innings pitched. He will pitch out of the bullpen today, with Corbin Burnes and Freddy Peralta scheduled to start the two games of the doubleheader.\nStatistics courtesy of Baseball-Reference.",

        "link": "https://buckscountybeacon.com/2022/09/my-experience-working-for-ashley-ehasz-as-a-young-field-organizer/",
        "description": "When I first met Ashley Ehasz at a Doylestown rally for gun safety in mid-May, I was itching to jump back into the campaign world and work for a candidate that I believed in. Having grown up in Bucks County where Ashley is running to be the next congresswoman, I was passionate about electing someone new into office who was devoted to their constituents, who was willing to listen to a diverse range of perspectives, and who was actually committed to putting their words into action.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI was politically engaged throughout high school as a community activist, focusing on bringing more diversity and equity to Central Bucks through protests, press conferences, and speeches. But as I grew older I began to recognize that activism requires advocates in public office who were dedicated to making sure policies were passed that made a genuine impact on people’s lives. As I saw Ashley speak so strongly about legislative change that needed to happen in order to protect families and communities in Bucks County, I realized that she was genuinely committed to bettering our lives in this district – something that we desperately need.\n\n\n\n\nWhy We Need Students To Mobilize In Central Bucks – And Why We Need Them Now | After @CBSDSchools passed a book banning policy, @sarahzhaang wants more students to organize, mobilize &amp; rise up to defend their #education. #BucksCounty #BookBans  https://t.co/TbudJ3jOr4&mdash; BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) July 27, 2022\n\n\n\n\nMany know Pennsylvania’s First Congressional District (PA-01), or Bucks County and a slice of Montgomery County, for being a crucial swing region in a purple state. PA-01 is a Biden +5 district, meaning that we voted for Biden with a 5 percent margin over Trump in 2020, yet every Democratic challenger that had faced Republican incumbent Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick and his millions of largely outside money in the past few years had been unsuccessful. When I was first brought onto the campaign, I knew that challenging Fitzpatrick would undoubtedly be an uphill battle. Not only did he have a massive financial advantage, but in terms of name recognition, he was widely known across the district while Ashley was a first-time candidate. Additionally, Fitzpatrick held an image of being a moderate Republican, meaning even Democrats were drawn to him to represent PA-01. Amidst other factors, it seemed doubtful that we could gain an edge over Fitzpatrick.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n.@RepBrianFitz Votes Against Combatting White Supremacist &amp; Neo-Nazi Activity in Military &amp; Law Enforcement | The Pentagon has already raised alarms about white supremacist inroads into our armed forces. #PA01’s Republican congressman is unconcerned. https://t.co/we3tteelrr&mdash; BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) July 14, 2022\n\n\n\n\nHowever, everything changed after the overturn of Roe v. Wade through the Dobbs decision. As the outrage over SCOTUS’s decision in late June grew, along with polling numbers after the Dobbs decision, it became clear that the community in our district was deeply affected. People have started to come together from across party lines to protect the right to choose, and they are looking at their current representative differently.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFitzpatrick voted twice against codifying Roe and the Women’s Health Protection Act; he’s on the record vowing to defund Planned Parenthood; he supports the Republican agenda to ban abortion even in some cases of rape or incest, or even with threats to the mother’s health. And the outrage is not just in our district. Polls show the majority of Americans support abortion access at some level and as the election season continues, voters are showing us this matters to them &#8211; a win for Democrats in NY-19’s special election, Kansas’s constitutional amendment on abortion turned down despite it being a deep-red state, Mary Peltola’s win in Alaska as the first Democrat senator to hold the seat in over 50 years. And now in PA-01, Ashley, a veteran who fought to protect the rights of Americans overseas, is a pro-choice candidate, running against Fitzpatrick.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n#PA01 &quot;Fitzpatrick stomped on reproductive freedom with his September 2021 NO vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill that would have enshrined into law the protections granted by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade.&quot; https://t.co/a0Es2O2RJA&mdash; Jenny Stephens (@JennyStephens52) May 3, 2022\n\n\n\n\nAs the organizer on the campaign responsible for direct contact between the campaign and our 750,000 constituents in order to mobilize people to vote, I have heard over and over again that abortion is the number one issue that voters in the district are concerned about. My goal while working for Ashley was not only to build a comprehensive program that reached out to infrequent voters across the district but also to engage young people in the political sphere. More young people are undoubtedly needed in politics &#8211; studies show that our generation is the worst off in terms of finding affordable housing, facing the climate crisis, and undergoing other financial and economic hardships via student loans and inflation &#8211; and having our voices heard through campaigns is essential to making sure we are represented in office. With full campaign support, I focused on building an internship program that engaged youth and students up and down the East Coast &#8211; drawing people from Florida up to Massachusetts &#8211; as a crucial component of our field work. Now, with almost 50 interns on the team, we’ve been able to make thousands of calls to voters and create social media content reaching hundreds of people online. Our campaign understands how necessary Gen Z is to this election, and by engaging dozens of students we’re capable of expanding our reach across PA-01.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nFighting for #Abortion Rights Must Be Local, Intergenerational, and Loud writes @mizdejong | #BucksCounty’s student-led #BansOffOurBodies protest in Doylestown gives me hope that we can win this fight. READ: https://t.co/kHii4BlliE pic.twitter.com/AyZNWyHA3l&mdash; BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) July 12, 2022\n\n\n\n\nThe young people on our team are not only determined to make an impact on this election that is crucial for our futures, but we have all grown up in an environment shaped heavily by policies and legislation that affects us deeply. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that we’ve all been drawn to this campaign in different ways and are passionate about creating change through Ashley’s race. When we make phone calls to voters, I urge every intern and volunteer to share why we’re involved with this race. For some, they grew up in the district and believe Fitzpatrick doesn’t represent their views. For others who live farther away, Ashley’s platform aligns with them more and they quote specific policies they believe in. Many tell voters about how the overturning of Roe negatively impacted them, or those around them that they loved.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe greatest lesson I have learned in campaigns is that every story has the power to make a difference. Our passion for this work comes because the system, and certain politicians, have failed us in a way that we have the capacity to change when we become involved. Working for Ashley has not only exposed me to more of the world of politics, but I am endlessly grateful to have the support of a team that believes in the power of youth mobilization and Gen Z in this election. Our team is united by our desire to create change, but more importantly, to create community. Ashley and I both understand the impact one story can have on one voter. And I am determined to win this November through the power of sharing our stories.",

A tweet from Jon Spector, Overwatch’s commercial lead, indicates new heroes will be gated behind battle pass progression, saying that “new Overwatch 2 heroes will be available on the free track of the Battle Pass.”\nSpector’s tweet appears to reference a description of Overwatch 2’s Watchpoint Pack, a purchasable content bundle that grants buyers all kinds of goodies, including skins, in-game currency, and access to the season 1 premium battle pass. \n\n\nAddressing some incomplete info posted early about our Overwatch 2 Battle Pass – we'll be sharing all details ahead of launch, but want to confirm that new Overwatch 2 heroes...\n\n\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

At its X Summit event in New York City today, Fujifilm is announcing a new high-res X-H2 camera with a 40.2-megapixel X-Trans sensor with 8K video. This pro-oriented camera looks just like the recent X-H2S it’s based on, matching it with the same processor, in-body image stabilization system, dual card slots, electronic viewfinder, and more. It’s nearly the same camera with a different sensor for those who value megapixels most. Though the higher resolution counterpart will cost about $500 less than the X-H2S when it ships in late September for $1,999.95...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "Some retailers are taking lobster off the menu after an assessment from an influential conservation group that the seafood poses too much of a risk to rare whales and should be avoided.Whales can suffer injuries and fatalities when they become entangled in the gear that connects to lobster traps on the ocean floor. Seafood Watch, which rates the sustainability of different seafoods, said this week it has added the American and Canadian lobster fisheries to its “red list” of species to avoid.The organization, based at Monterey Bay Aquarium in California, said in a report that the fishing industry is a danger to North Atlantic right whales because “current management measures do not go far enough to mitigate entanglement risks and promote recovery of the species.”Thousands of businesses use Seafood Watch&#x27;s recommendations to inform seafood buying decisions, and many have pledged to avoid any items that appear on the red list. A spokesperson for Blue Apron, the New York meal kit retailer, said after the release of the report that the company no longer offers lobster. HelloFresh, the Germany-based meal kit company that is the largest such company operating in the U.S., also pledged shortly after the announcement to stop selling lobster.“HelloFresh is committed to responsible sourcing and follows guidelines from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program,” said Saskia Leisewitz, a spokesperson for HelloFresh.Seafood Watch assigns ratings of “best choice,” “good alternative” and “avoid” to more than 2,000 seafood items based on how sustainably they are managed. The organization&#x27;s recommendations have been influential in the past, such as when it red-listed the Louisiana shrimp fishery, prompting efforts to better protect sea turtles. The fishery was later removed from the red list.The lobster fishing industry has come under scrutiny from Seafood Watch because of the threat of entanglement in fishing gear. The North Atlantic right whales number less than 340 and entanglement is one of the two biggest threats they face, along with collisions with ships, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other groups have said. The population of the giant animals, which were decimated during the commercial whaling era generations ago, has fallen in recent years.Members of the lobster fishing industry, which is also coping with increased federal fishing restrictions to protect the whales, pushed back against the Seafood Watch rating. The lobster industry in Maine, where most of the U.S.&#x27;s lobster comes to land, has not had a documented interaction with a right whale in almost two decades, said Patrice McCarron, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen&#x27;s Association.“Lobster is one of the most sustainable fisheries in the world due to the effective stewardship practices handed down through generations of lobstermen. These include strict protections for both the lobster resource and right whales,” McCarron said.American and Canadian lobster fishermen target the same species, the American lobster, which is popular as live seafood and in processed products such as lobster rolls and lobster ravioli. The vast majority of the world&#x27;s American lobster comes to the shore in New England and eastern Canada, and the crustaceans are both a key piece of the economy and a cultural marker in both places.The U.S. lobster fishery is also one of the most lucrative in the country and was worth more than $900 million at the docks in 2021, when fishermen caught more than 130 million pounds (59 million kilograms) of the crustaceans.Seafood Watch partners with numerous major seafood buyers on its recommendations. Some of the buyers, such as Compass Group and Cheesecake Factory, did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press. A spokesperson for one, Mars Petcare, said the company doesn&#x27;t have lobster in its supply chain.Environmental groups said Seafood Watch&#x27;s decision places a spotlight on the fishery and the need to do more to protect whales.“Fishery managers must increase protections to save North Atlantic right whales so seafood retailers, consumers, and restaurants can put American lobster and crab back on the menu,” Oceana campaign director Gib Brogan said.",

        "description": "On Tuesday, outgoing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave his&nbsp;final speech&nbsp;in front of 10 Downing Street and declared “like Cincinnatus, I am returning to my plow.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Johnson — and nearly all other politicians from around the world who pull the famed Roman,&nbsp;Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, into their rhetoric are just trying to cast themselves as disinterested patriots rather than partisan officials.\n\n\n\nTwo thousand four hundred and eighty years earlier, Cincinnatus, an upper-class patrician and a retired consul (the top elected office) was tending his modest farm on the outskirts of Rome, when the Aequians threatened invasion. The Roman Senate, facing pestilence and war, feared the current consul was unfit and granted Cincinnatus dictatorial powers for six months. Many feared “the extent of his authority as&nbsp;too great.” But they were unfounded. After achieving victory at the&nbsp;Battle of Mount Algidus, the Roman dictator “laid down” his sword and returned home to his farm and plow. He could have legally held control for another five and half months (and who knows after that), but the Senate was restored within 16 days.\n\n\n\nOne politician literally saved Rome and went back to his four acre-farm, the other&nbsp;expanded gigabit broadband&nbsp;to British households and resigned in the shadow of&nbsp;partying&nbsp;during pandemic lockdowns. The comparison just doesn’t fit. Johnson is not a modern Cincinnatus. In resigning and being elected under pressure, the former prime minister was merely bending to the will of his party, the British people and an established parliamentary process.\n\n\n\nYet, in harkening back to Cincinnatus, Johnson was continuing a long legacy of comparing modern leaders to classical ones. He was also casting himself as exhibiting civic virtue, or devotion to the nation above the individual or party. Many in the United Kingdom and the world would disagree with his self-assessment. But all leaders should aspire to the title, their actions just have to match their words.\n\n\n\nBy surrendering power after being declared “the sole hope of the Roman people,” Cincinnatus became an ideal. He was an anti-Caesar, who would not cross the Rubicon and destroy the Roman Republic. Cincinnatus’ legend lasted over two and half millennia, was enshrined in ancient history and even manifested in Russell Crowe’s fictional&nbsp;Maximus Decimus Meridius and his desire to “go home,” his refusal to accept the title of emperor, and his promise to return Rome to the people in the Academy-Award winning&nbsp;Gladiator&nbsp;(he even throws down his sword twice ... and an axe). But it’s the birth and expansion of the British Empire that linked Cincinnatus with Anglo-Americans. Cincinnatus was not just the anti-Caesar, but he was the anti-Oliver Cromwell, who had assumed dictatorial power after the English Civil War of the mid-17th century.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEnlightenment Brits and Americans looked to themselves as the heirs of ancient Rome. And the story of Cincinnatus became a political measuring stick. Members of the House of Commons, who,&nbsp;according to the “Public Advertiser” newspaper,&nbsp;“leave like another Cincinnatus, his rural employments; and, when he is sent for, come to” London, were championed above those in the House of Lords (though Cincinnatus was actually a patrician). His name was also used as a pseudonym to voice anonymous political opinions in newspaper articles from a perceived moral high ground. The American Revolution’s rejection of monarchy only solidified the Cincinnatus model of the western side of the Atlantic.\n\n\n\nThere has only been one who can wear that mantle: George Washington.\n\n\n\nThrough the American Revolution, General Washington was able to ascend to these heights. He was proclaimed the “American Cincinnatus” for surrendering his military commission as commander in chief after victory in the American Revolution. Many around the world, especially those in Britain, expected Washington to retain power, which is why King George III was shocked and called him “the greatest man in the world” for his display unmatched since the classical age. It was these extraordinary circumstances that made Washington's actions so profound when he returned to his own farm, Mount Vernon, in 1783 and again left the presidency in 1796 when he could have served for life. Washington reaffirmed the Cincinnatus example and set a modern precedent.\n\n\n\nSince that time, history is filled with accounts of victorious military commanders turned authoritarians from Napoleon Bonaparte to Fidel Castro. That is why the Cincinnatus mantle remains so lofty and why Washington’s leadership is similarly heralded. It’s an idea that echoed through eternity or at least back to 458 BC.\n\n\n\nUnlike Cincinnatus (or Washington), Johnson was not called out of retirement to save his country nor did he immediately give up power when the task was complete — he was (and may still be) a career politician. He even used the Cincinnatus metaphor back&nbsp;in 2009, while he was mayor of London. Johnson’s decision was driven by over&nbsp;50 members&nbsp;of Parliament quitting in protest. This was hardly a display of his own civic virtue. His resignation was also hardly unique,&nbsp;11 other PMs&nbsp;have done the same since the 20th century.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere are many politicians, but few great leaders and even fewer who willingly put the nation first like Cincinnatus or Washington. Even while Johnson called on the “time for politics to be over” and to “deliver for the people of this country,” he was speaking only to other conservatives, not the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\nJohnson will not retire to his farmhouse in Oxfordshire as a British Cincinnatus. Still, politicians should aspire to bring back the model of virtue and selfless patriotism, but they need to stop with the empty rhetoric. Cincinnatus’s and Washington’s greatness was in their actions. We need a new Cincinnatus and the values he represents more than ever on both sides of the Atlantic, but words are not enough.\n\n\n\nCraig Bruce Smith is a historian and the author of “American Honor: The Creation of the Nation’s Ideals during the Revolutionary Era.” All views are the author's.

Her leadership and enduring diplomacy secured and advanced alliances with the United States and countries around the world,” Trump said in a statement from his website 45office.com.\n\n\n\nThe former president shared condolences on behalf of himself and former first lady Melania Trump. \n\n\n\n“Melania and I will always cherish our time together with the Queen, and never forget Her Majesty’s generous friendship, great wisdom, and wonderful sense of humor.&nbsp;What a grand and beautiful lady she was—there was nobody like her!”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump said during his presidency that he was a \"tremendous fan\" of Queen Elizabeth, telling British newspaper The Sun that \"she has really never made a mistake.\"\n\n\n\nAfter a state visit to the United Kingdom in 2019, Trump famously said the monarch had more fun with him during the trip than she’d had in 25 years. He was the 12th sitting U.S. president welcomed at Buckingham Palace by the late queen.  \n\n\n\n“May God bless the Queen, may she reign forever in our hearts, and may God hold her and Prince Philip in abiding care,” Trump concluded in his Thursday statement.&nbsp;",

(AP Photo/Jessica Hill)\n\n\n\nWelcome to The Hill’s Campaign Report, tracking all things related to the 2022 midterm elections. You can expect this newsletter in your inbox every&nbsp;Tuesday, Wednesday&nbsp;and&nbsp;Thursday&nbsp;leading up to November's election.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEmail us tips and feedback: Max Greenwood (mgreenwood@thehill.com), Julia Manchester (jmanchester@thehill.com), and Caroline Vakil (cvakil@thehill.com). \n\n\n\nDelaware, New Hampshire, Rhode Island still to vote\n\n\n\nMost campaigns have now shifted gears into general election mode — but not all of them.\n\n\n\nVoters in Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island will be among the last to weigh in on their primaries next Tuesday.\n\n\n\nNext week’s primaries feature two Republicans fighting it out to advance to a competitive Senate race in New Hampshire, the set up for a likely rematch between Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D) and Republican candidate Lee Murphy for Delaware’s lone House seat and a crowded Democratic primary to take on Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee (D).\n\n\n\nHere’s a look ahead at some of the races we’re watching next week:\n\n\n\nIn New Hampshire:&nbsp;One of the most closely watched races next week will be the GOP Senate primary to take on Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), who is fighting for a second term after she won her first election in 2016 by about a tenth of a percentage point.\n\n\n\nRecent polling shows the leading GOP contender as retired Army Gen. Don Bolduc, who previously ran in the GOP primary to take on Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) in 2020. Bolduc lost that primary to Corky Messner (R), but Shaheen won her reelection by a comfortable margin of 15 percentage points.\n\n\n\nWhat to watch for:&nbsp;Whether former President Trump makes a last-minute endorsement in the GOP primary. So far, the former president hasn’t waded in officially, but he has&nbsp;previously praised&nbsp;Bolduc.Republicans and Democrats are spending money to target state Senate President Chuck Morse (R). CNN&nbsp;is reporting&nbsp;that some Republicans have concerns about Bolduc’s general election chances, spending money instead to boost Morse.&nbsp;Meanwhile, CQ RollCall&nbsp;is also reporting&nbsp;that Democrats are wading into the race by running negative ads against Morse, which could be seen as an effort to boost Bolduc.The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the seat as “lean Democrat.”\n\n\n\nAlso keep an eye on&nbsp;the state’s two House seats as crowded GOP fields vie for the chance to take on&nbsp;Reps. Chris Pappas (D-N.H.) and Ann Kuster (D-N.H.).&nbsp;Both seats have been rated as “toss ups” by Cook Political Report.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFlashback:&nbsp;Pappas, who was first elected in 2018, last won his reelection in 2020 by 5 percentage points. Kuster, who was first elected in 2012, won her House bid in 2020 by 10 points.\n\n\n\nOver in Delaware:&nbsp;The primaries for Delaware’s at-large congressional district have largely been decided given that Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D) is running for reelection against only one Republican, Lee Murphy. But while this primary may be less suspenseful, the general election matchup is one to watch given that the two previously went head to head in 2020. Murphy lost that race by a 17-percentage point margin.\n\n\n\nIn Rhode Island:&nbsp;Four Democrats are challenging Democratic Gov. Dan McKee in the gubernatorial primary next week, including state Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, former state Secretary of State Matt Brown, former CVS executive Helena Foulkes and physician Luis Daniel Muñoz.\n\n\n\nOn the Republican side, candidates include Jonathan Riccitelli and Ashley Kalus. Cook Political Report rates the seat “solid Democrat.”\n\n\n\nAlso keep an eye out for&nbsp;Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District, which was left open by Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.) after he announced earlier this year that he wouldn’t be seeking reelection.\n\n\n\nFive Democrats are looking to grab the seat, which Cook Political Report rates as a “toss up”:\n\n\n\nRefugee Dream Center founder Omar Bah, small business owner Joy Fox, General Treasurer Seth Magaziner, former director of the Peace Corps Response Sarah Morgenthau and former state lawmaker David Segal.\n\n\n\nWhy Republicans are still favored to win the House\n\n\n\nDemocrats have seized political momentum over the past two months. They passed major legislation, won hotly contested special elections and rallied voters around the fight over abortion rights.\n\n\n\nThey&nbsp;still face long odds&nbsp;in their bid to hold on to their House majority.\n\n\n\nThat’s for a few reasons:\n\n\n\nRedistricting:&nbsp;Republicans didn’t get the kind of ironclad congressional maps that they had hoped for, but, accounting for incumbency, they still came out on top. Courts threw out Democratic gerrymanders in states like New York and Maryland, while Republicans made big gains in states like Florida, where a map proposed by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) created four new GOP-leaning House seats.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOverall, Republicans appear likely to gain three or four seats thanks to redistricting alone. And given that they only need to net five seats to recapture control of the House this year, the redistricting outcome puts them most of the way there.\n\n\n\nRetirements:&nbsp;Thirty-one House Democrats are foregoing reelection this year. Some of them are simply running for other offices, while others are leaving electoral politics altogether. It’s not unusual for members from the president’s party to leave the House ahead of midterm elections. But the historic number of Democratic retirements this year has created a handful of openings that Republicans are hoping to take advantage of.\n\n\n\nAmong the seats being targeted by the GOP this year is Pennsylvania’s 17th District. The seat was left open after Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.) decided to seek the state’s Democratic Senate nomination. Likewise, Rep. Cheri Bustos’ (D-Ill.) retirement has left Illinois’s 17th District up for grabs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNational environment:&nbsp;While things have improved for Democrats in recent months, there’s still a lot for them to worry about. President Biden’s approval rating remains underwater and inflation is still at its highest level in decades. There are also lingering concerns that the U.S. may be creeping closer to an economic recession.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats also face the challenge of retaining their momentum for the next two months — a particularly difficult task in a rapidly changing political environment.\n\n\n\nHistory:&nbsp;It’s one of the most consistent trends in American politics: the party of the president almost always loses ground in Congress in midterm elections. Since the end of World War II, only two midterm cycles have seen the president’s party gain seats in the House — in 1998 and 2002.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExactly why it’s so rare for the president’s party to come out on top in the midterms is up for debate. It could be that the president’s supporters are simply less motivated to vote or that Americans are inclined to view midterms as a referendum on the party in power. Either way, overcoming historical precedent won’t be easy for Democrats this year.\n\n\n\nPOLL WATCH\n\n\n\nPresident Biden&nbsp;holds a 6-percentage point lead&nbsp;over former President Trump among registered voters in a hypothetical 2024 matchup, according to a&nbsp;Yahoo News-YouGov poll.\n\n\n\nThe poll, which was released on Wednesday, shows Biden receiving support from 48 percent of registered voters compared to Trump with 42 percent. The polling comes while Biden’s approval rating has still remained under 50 percent, though it has seen a moderate increase recently.\n\n\n\nAD WATCH\n\n\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) released a new ad on Thursday targeting Rep. Tom O'Halleran (D-Ariz.), tying him to President Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)\n\n\n\n“Tom O’Halleran: 100 percent with Biden. One hundred percent with Pelosi. Zero percent with you,” a narrator says in part of the 30-second ad,&nbsp;called “Brick By Brick.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nO’Halleran is fighting for reelection in Arizona’s 2nd Congressional District, which the nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates as “likely Republican.”\n\n\n\nThat’s it for today.

        "description": "Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were quick to share their condolences Thursday after news broke that Queen Elizabeth II died at her Balmoral Castle in Scotland, as well as celebrating the legacy she leaves behind after a record-breaking reign.\n\n\n\n“When it comes to Queen Elizabeth II, the combination of longevity, impeccable character, and incredible leadership over seven decades of war and peace is likely never to be seen again,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) wrote. “Well done, Your Majesty.”  \n\n\n\nThe monarch \"bent the arc of history over her 70-year reign,\" said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.).&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“She took the throne at an age when most people are beginning their adult lives and was tasked with the immense responsibility of leading her nation in the aftermath of World War II,” wrote Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) of the Queen.  \n\n\n\n“In her 70 years on the throne, she bore witness to the most consequential events that our world has ever seen and helped foster the close and important relationship that the United States shares with the United Kingdom.” \n\n\n\nThe Royal Family announced Thursday that the queen had died peacefully after Buckingham Palace announced earlier in the day that he doctors were concerned about her health. \n\n\n\nAmong the many members of the upper chamber who posted to lament the queen's passing was Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who called the late queen “an example for leaders around the world” and praised her “life of steadfast service” as Britain’s leader.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Today is a sad day. Queen Elizabeth II was an extraordinary leader and historic friend of the U.S. who strengthened America’s relationship with the United Kingdom and helped bring stability to the world,” wrote Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.). \n\n\n\nFrom the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) remembered being present on the House floor when Queen Elizabeth addressed Congress in 1991, and welcoming the monarch as Speaker when she visited the U.S. in 2007.\n\n\n\nThe queen \"helped advance a new global order of security, prosperity and peace\" and \"offered a masterclass in grace and strength, power and poise,\" Pelosi said.\n\n\n\nGOP leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said the late monarch \"represented what it means to lead with conviction, selflessness, and faith in God and in her people.\"\n\n\n\nRep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) added Queen Elizabeth \"will go down in history as one of the most consequential monarchs.\"",

The Brewers are back home at American Family Field today, and for the first time at American Family Field, there will be a traditional doubleheader. The Brewers and Giants were originally scheduled to play the first week of the season, but due to the delay in the season, it was rescheduled. These two teams will play a quick two-game series before the Reds come to town tomorrow.\nCorbin Burnes will pitch game one of the series this afternoon. He hit the 200 strikeout mark for the season in his last start, and will continue to build on that today. Assuming he pitches more than three innings today, he will surpass his 167 IP from last season. While he is in the Cy Young conversation, he will likely need a strong run to finish the season (as well as a strong Brewers run) to have a chance to repeat.\nHere are the lineups for Game 1 of the doubleheader.\n\n\nDoubleheader time. : @BallySportWI : @620wtmj@fleet_farm | #ThisIsMyCrew pic.twitter.com/rfvpSWWhKM— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nGiants starting lineup for Game 1: Lamonte Wade Jr. (1B)Mike Yastrzemski (CF)Wilmer Flores (DH)Joc Pederson (LF)Thairo Estrada (2B)Brandon Crawford (SS)David Villar (3B)Luis Gonzalez (RF)Joey Bart (C)SP: Scott Alexander (0-0, 1.69 ERA)— Joey Pollizze (@joeypollizze) September 8, 2022",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/angels-lawsuit-dominican-republic-backed-out-signings.html",
        "description": "A pair of minor league players have filed suit against the Angels for allegedly reneging on verbal agreements made back in 2019, ESPN&#8217;s Jeff Passan reports. Outfielder Willy Fañas, now with the Mets, and infielder Keiderson Pavon, now with the Rangers, claim that the Angels verbally agreed to respective signing bonuses of $1.8MM and $425K in 2019. The Dominican Prospect League shared a video of former Angels director of international scouting Carlos Gomez (not the former player) informing Pavon the team plans to sign him, at which point a then 15-year-old Pavon breaks down in tears of joy (YouTube link).\nFañas and Pavon allege that those agreements, which came more than a year in advance of the players&#8217; eligibility to sign under Major League Baseball&#8217;s rules &#8212; international amateurs can sign beginning on their 16th birthdays &#8212; were withdrawn in 2020, less than one month before the international signing period was set to commence. Fañas had been 14 at the time of his agreement; Pavon was 15. As Passan points out, the Covid-19 pandemic pushed the July 2, 2020 signing eligibility date back to January of 2021, and by that point, the Halos had fired then-GM Billy Eppler and replaced him with current GM Perry Minasian. With that change came alterations in the international scouting department; Minasian hired Brian Parker to oversee the team&#8217;s international operations.\nBoth players have since signed with new clubs, though Fañas waited until the following signing period to put pen to paper on a contract with a new team. Because early deals just such as these are so common throughout the industry, neither player was able to find a team able to immediately commit a substantial bonus; like the Angels, other teams had already verbally committed the majority of resources in their hard-capped signing pools to other amateurs well in advance of those teenage prospects reaching actual signing eligibility. Fañas, perhaps unsurprisingly, ultimately inked a $1.5MM bonus with the Mets, where Eppler is now GM. Pavon signed for $150K with the Rangers.\nWhile both players eventually found organizations with which to sign, albeit at reduced rates, they&#8217;re still seeking damages from the Angels. Fañas is seeking $17MM, while Pavon seeks $4.25MM.\nThose figures represent roughly ten times what the Angels had initially promised, though the representatives for Fañas and Pavon could cite multiple factors in seeking such weighty sums. It&#8217;s common for players, upon reaching a verbal agreement with a team, to take out loans with exorbitant interest rates, with the intent that the eventual signing bonus will allow those players to pay back that loan. The team withdrawing an offer obviously creates complications in such instances. Speculatively, it&#8217;s also plausible that the Fañas and Pavon camps could claim the players&#8217; delayed paths to potential arbitration and free-agent paydays were delayed by the alleged Angels actions. There&#8217;s no guarantee they&#8217;d ever reach those milestones, of course, and quantifying the exact amount that delay cost either player is impossible.\nWhether the suit is successful carries long-term ramifications with regard to the broader international market. Because the league and players association were unable to come to terms on an agreement regarding an international draft, the status quo system that permits this level of largely unregulated advance agreements is likely to remain in place until 2026, when the current collective bargaining agreement expires. If Fañas and Pavon are successful in demonstrating that there are repercussions for teams pursuing premature verbal agreements that flout the rules put into place by MLB, it stands to reason that they may be more reluctant to barter such deals.\nThe sword cuts both ways, it should be noted. It&#8217;s also not uncommon for a player and his trainer and representation to back out of an agreement with a team if he elevates his profile considerably between the time that agreement is reached and the time he&#8217;s actually eligible to sign. The rampant disregard for rules prompted agent Ulises Cabrera, who helped establish the Dominican Prospect League and who works with dozens of Latin American players, to refer to the entire system as &#8220;the wild, wild West&#8221; when speaking to ESPN.\nAlthough the suit was initially filed in May, any ruling on the litigation will wait until months down the road. Passan adds that a Dominican judge recently moved to postpone the appearance of witnesses until late November. And while many American fans may wonder whether there&#8217;s any real chance that a court of law would agree to uphold a verbal agreement as a binding contract, Passan quotes several Dominican lawyers and legal professionals who emphasize that the Dominican justice system places greater emphasis on verbal declarations than the United States court system does. The report features lengthy quotes from Cabrera, from the lawyers representing Fañas and Pavon, from third-party legal professionals in the Dominican and from the plaintiffs themselves, so those with interest will want to check it out in its entirety to grasp the full scope of the controversy.",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Aurich Lawson / Getty Images)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver Labor Day weekend, one of the biggest online security services providers, Cloudflare, made what it called a “dangerous” decision to block access to one of its most controversial customers, an increasingly violent alt-right web forum called Kiwi Farms.\nThe decision came two weeks into a pressure campaign dubbed \"Drop Kiwi Farms,\" which was launched by Clara Sorrenti—online alias “Keffals”—a transgender activist and Twitch streamer among those targeted most venomously by Kiwi Farms. The goal was to protect people like Keffals and fight back by forcing Cloudflare and other Internet service providers to stop enabling Kiwi Farms’ escalating attacks on trans people and other vulnerable communities.\nCloudflare held out for weeks as the pressure campaign raged on social media. But then, within a 48-hour period, Cloudflare noted that Kiwi Farms users were growing increasingly aggressive and had started doxxing and swatting victims. (Doxxing is when someone publishes private information to incite violence against a target, and swatting involves placing a hoax call reporting imminent suicide or gun violence to police so they descend on targets with force.)Read 33 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

(credit: Bridgestone)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's still a lot of petroleum hanging onto electric cars, specifically around the rims. It takes about seven gallons of oil to make each standard car tire, and the world produces more than 2 billion tires every year. Now, some tire companies are turning to a desert shrub and a novel means of pulling natural rubber compounds out of it.\nBridgestone Americas has been working with guayule (Parthenium argentatum) since 2012. The tire company broke ground on a research facility in Mesa, Arizona, in 2012, started evaluating sample tires in 2015, and received multiple grants from the US Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Energy for its research and molecular breeding work. Just last month, the company committed another $42 million to expanding its harvesting partnerships, with 350 acres in the short term and 250,000 more planned. That's part of more than $100 million invested into guayule-based rubber, the company says.\n\"With guayule, we can reduce the environmental impacts that come with overseas sourcing while also realizing a more sustainable agricultural system for parts of this country that are facing persistent and worsening climate conditions, so it’s really something with many benefits for our environment and our economy,\" said Nizar Trigui, chief technology officer for Bridgestone Americas, in a press release.Read 7 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

As spotted by MacRumors yesterday, the company updated the AppleCare+ subscription support service to offer \"unlimited\" repairs across its current product line. That's much more flexible than the two repairs per year previously offered, as per the Wayback Machine.\nAccording to the fine print, this only covers \"physical damage from handling due to unexpected and unintentional events.\" And there are associated service fees. Fixing broken glass on an iPhone, for example, will cost you $29 in addition to your monthly subscription fee. And you can pay $299 for accidental Mac damage on top of the unit's subscription cost.\nFor anyone curious about how subscription pricing compares for Apple's just-announced offerings, Apple is charging the same biennial fee for the iPhone 14 announced yesterday as it is for the iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13, and iPhone 12 ($149). However, coverage for the iPhone 14 Plus is $179 for two years, and it'll run you $199 to cover the iPhone 14 Pro or Pro Max for two years (Apple also sells monthly subscriptions).Read 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Getty Images\n    \n\n  Checking in at the doorstep of history. It’s been three months and two days since I first wrote about Aaron Judge hunting 62 home runs. At the time, I knew it was a risk to talk about the chase — Judge had “just” 21 long balls at the time, a third of the way to Roger Maris’ 61, and so much baseball left to play. Judge has a history of injuries, the math was against him staying so hot, he was doomed to fall off his pace.\nHe has 27 games left to hit seven home runs, 90 percent of the way to passing Maris with 83 percent of the season played. Both Steamer and ZiPS, the projection systems FanGraphs relies on, have Judge finishing at 62 exactly. He’s blown past all his projections this season already, and its the last time I’ll mention FanGraphs in this post, because what matters about Aaron Judge in 2022 is how he makes us feel, and less about the final number.\nThe Yankee season has been divided, almost perfectly in half, by unprecedented dominance followed by hair-pulling frustration. At the time that first post on the chase for 62 came out, the Yankees were 39-15, a .722 win percentage that had them on pace for the greatest regular season of all-time. Aaron Judge was, by a nose, the second-best player in baseball, 0.1 fWAR behind Mookie Betts, leading the home run table by five. He felt like the lead bull at Pamplona, and the rest of baseball would have been best served by getting out of the way. Since that post went up, the Yankees are 42-39, an average baseball team. Aaron Judge has 11 more home runs than the next closest guy in that span. He’s no longer the lead bull, and much closer to the only force pulling an entire 26-man roster toward respectability.\nAnd now we’re in the final month of the season, two dozen odd games for the Yankees to secure a playoff spot that once looked inevitable, and for Judge to pass a record that’s stood for 60 years. The dominant debate in baseball circles today is whether Judge’s outright dominance is more valuable than Shohei Ohtani’s two-way performance in end of season award talk, but Judge’s year goes so far beyond MVP talk in my opinion.\nThe last time we had a real chase for 60 homers was Giancarlo Stanton’s attempt in 2017, which was an extraordinary, MVP season ... but it happened while he played for the Marlins. I’m not the biggest fan of “playing in New Yawk is different, bro” kind of analysis, but the differences between the two franchises, the attention and pressure, are real. The Marlins in 2017 won 77 games, finishing 20 behind the Nationals in the NL East. For Stanton, he could pretty much take daddy swings all summer.\nJudge is the face of baseball, the best player on the most popular team, a team that everyone in the league is gunning for. The lack of production behind him, combined with with team’s front running status, means Judge has seen fewer pitches in the zone — albeit by just a single percentage point — and fewer fastballs, by six points, than Stanton did in his 59-home run season. Every time that Judge gets a fastball in the zone registers a slight surprise, as the season has gone on we’ve seen many teams adopt a near-Bondsian strategy of Don’t Let This Guy Beat You.\nAnd yet, This Guy Has Beaten You. Yes, he leads baseball in WAR, yes, he leads baseball in WPA, but what really stands out about his season is how you count off how many batters until his spot in the order again. In a close game, you think “just get it to Judge,” and in a blowout, he’s often the only thing worth watching. His plate appearances have become must-see television, and that will only grow as his inches closer and closer to Maris.\n\nI still don’t think that baseball is quite prepared for this. As I said above, we have had an “asterisk-free” chase for 60 just a few years ago, but it is and will be different when its a Yankee, when the Yankees are in a pennant race, and when the player in question is about to become a free agent. He’s one step ahead of history with every possible narrative that could be written already in draft form — greatest walk year of all time, single-handedly delivered a playoff berth, the rebirth of Mystique and Aura in a building across the street from their old home.\nIf I were to bet today, I’d bet that Judge passes Maris, and passes his projected 62 count as well. His cold streaks, when they happen, have lasted about a week, and his hot streaks are as hot as any player in baseball history. The pressure is turning up, but he’s shown that he can handle any kind of pressure the media or fanbase throws at him already. He is seven home runs away from history, and I’m not sure there’s anyone who is more destined to make it.",

        "description": "Chris Galdieri: &#8220;Oz is not the first person to relocate to run for office. Hillary Clinton moved to New York to run for the Senate in 2000, and Mitt Romney won his Senate race in Utah after serving as governor of Massachusetts and running for president in 2012.&#8221;\n&#8220;But carpetbagger candidates often struggle to establish themselves in their new states. They lack the ingrained, long-term knowledge that comes from living full-time in a state for years, leaving them open to charges that they are running to serve their own ambition, not the residents of their new state. Every candidate for office is ambitious, of course, but carpetbagging foregrounds ambition in a way that’s tough to ignore and provides easy fodder for opponents.&#8221;\n&#8220;The key dynamic to understand is that not all carpetbaggers are created equal. Success — or at least viability — has long hinged on whether a carpetbagger brings with them the credibility to counter critiques about running in a new state. Candidates such as Clinton and Romney were able to convince voters that they were in a new state to continue their long careers in public service.&#8221;",

Visit Michigan, however, and you will see the reverse. Democrats there are raging against a decision taken by the Supreme Court in June to overturn Roe v Wade, the ruling that declared abortion a constitutional right, which has left decisions on abortion to individual states. A dozen have already instituted near-total bans on the procedure.&#8221;\n&#8220;In this final stretch before the midterm elections on November 8th, Republicans should be preparing to seize power amid deep discontent with President Joe Biden. Michigan, which went for Donald Trump in 2016, should be the least of their worries. Instead they are fretting that they could lose all three of the major statewide elections, as well as control of at least one state legislative chamber and some competitive congressional seats.&#8221;",

        "description": "Chris Galdieri: &#8220;Oz is not the first person to relocate to run for office. Hillary Clinton moved to New York to run for the Senate in 2000, and Mitt Romney won his Senate race in Utah after serving as governor of Massachusetts and running for president in 2012.&#8221;\n&#8220;But carpetbagger candidates often struggle to establish themselves in their new states. They lack the ingrained, long-term knowledge that comes from living full-time in a state for years, leaving them open to charges that they are running to serve their own ambition, not the residents of their new state. Every candidate for office is ambitious, of course, but carpetbagging foregrounds ambition in a way that’s tough to ignore and provides easy fodder for opponents.&#8221;\n&#8220;The key dynamic to understand is that not all carpetbaggers are created equal. Success — or at least viability — has long hinged on whether a carpetbagger brings with them the credibility to counter critiques about running in a new state. Candidates such as Clinton and Romney were able to convince voters that they were in a new state to continue their long careers in public service.&#8221;",

Department of Justice (DOJ) on Thursday filed a notice of intent to appeal a ruling by a judge granting former President Trump’s request for a special master, asking the judge&nbsp;to partially&nbsp;stay a ruling blocking them from accessing the classified materials seized during a search of his home.\n\n\n\n“Without a stay, the government and public also will suffer irreparable harm from the undue delay to the criminal investigation,” the DOJ writes in its filing.\n\n\n\n“Any delay poses significant concerns in the context of an investigation into the mishandling of classified records.”\n\n\n\nThe motion for a partial stay would allow the government to continue its review of the classified records recovered from Trump’s home, removing from review by a yet-to-be-appointed third-party special master some 100 documents of roughly 10,000 taken in the Aug. 8 search.\n\n\n\nThe appeal itself will continue to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes six Trump appointees on the bench.\n\n\n\nThe filing digs into District Judge Aileen Cannon’s logic on a number of areas, pointing to many of the same issues in a ruling legal scholars largely&nbsp;panned as troubling.\n\n\n\nBut the bulk of the argument for a partial stay of her ruling granting a special master relies on the impact her decision could have on national security.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCannon allowed an intelligence community-led review of the documents to continue so that national security leaders could work to mitigate any fallout from the mishandling of records.\n\n\n\nBut the DOJ’s brief argues the intelligence community’s damage assessment and its own criminal investigation “are inextricably intertwined.”\n\n\n\n“The ongoing Intelligence Community (“IC”) classification review and assessment are closely interconnected with—and cannot be readily separated from—areas of inquiry of DOJ’s and the FBI’s ongoing criminal investigation,” they write, taking pains to note that “the FBI itself is a part of the intelligence community.”\n\n\n\nThe intelligence community has had access to an earlier tranche of records turned over by Trump since May, after the National Archives recovered 184 classified documents from Mar-a-Lago in January.\n\n\n\n“Before the Court’s Order, the same personnel from the FBI involved in the criminal investigation were coordinating appropriately with the IC in its review and assessment,” DOJ wrote, adding that the order “frustrate[s] the government’s ability to conduct an effective national security risk assessment and classification review and could preclude the government from taking necessary remedial steps in light of that review—risking irreparable harm to our national security and intelligence interests.”\n\n\n\nDOJ even specifically points to the 48 empty folders with classified banners as well as another 42 empty folders that were labeled “return to staff secretary/military aide” that were recovered during the search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\nIt is the FBI, they say, that would typically carry out an investigation into such a matter.\n\n\n\n“Within the United States, the FBI would pursue any allegation or lead indicating that the classified records may have been accessed, retained, or disseminated in violation of the law, including by using the tools and authorities of a criminal investigation,” the filing states.\n\n\n\n“If, for example, another department or agency in the IC were to obtain intelligence indicating that a classified document in the seized materials might have been compromised, the FBI would be responsible for taking some of the necessary steps to evaluate that risk.”\n\n\n\nDOJ’s filing comes ahead of a Friday deadline to work with Trump’s legal team to propose a list of candidates to serve as the special master responsible for reviewing the documents.\n\n\n\nElsewhere in the motion for a stay, DOJ picks apart the argument that Trump would have any executive privilege claims to classified records.\n\n\n\n“The classification markings establish on the face of the documents that they are government records, not Plaintiff’s personal records. The government’s review of those records does not raise any plausible attorney-client privilege claims because such classified records do not contain communications between Plaintiff and his private attorneys. And for several reasons, no potential assertion of executive privilege could justify restricting the Executive Branch’s review and use of the classified records at issue here,” DOJ argued.\n\n\n\n“There is no valid purpose to be served by a special master’s review of classified materials.”\n\n\n\nDOJ also noted that Trump’s legal team never raised the concept of being able to claim executive privilege over any classified records after Trump’s custodian of records was subpoenaed in May and asked to turn over any remaining documents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“To the extent that Plaintiff believed that any such records could be subject to a valid assertion of executive privilege, he should have advised the government of such a claim at that time and could have attempted to pursue such a claim through a motion to quash. But despite having several weeks to respond to the subpoena, plaintiff did not do so,” DOJ wrote.\n\n\n\nTrump mocked the appeal on his social media platform, saying that DOJ was “going to spend Millions of Dollars, &amp; vast amounts of Time &amp; Energy, to appeal the Order on the ‘Raid of Mar-a-Lago Document Hoax,’ by a brilliant and courageous Judge whose words of wisdom rang true throughout our Nation.”\n\n\n\nDOJ’s appeal of the ruling came after many legal experts said they had but little choice to fight the decision, even if additional litigation could also drag out its ability to reinitiate review of classified records in a crucial step for its investigation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBarbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney, said if the Justice Department’s primary goal is to indict Trump, an appeal could slow that process. But if DOJ decides the main goal is to protect executive privilege and its limitations from the potential precedent set by Cannon’s ruling, then a challenge makes more sense.\n\n\n\n“They may need to appeal even if it means adverse impact on this particular case,” she told The Hill prior to DOJ’s filing.\n\n\n\nAs DOJ officials wrestled with the question of how to proceed, they even got a huge nudge from Bill Barr, Trump's former attorney general, who came out sharply against Cannon's ruling and urged the Justice Department to appeal it.\n\n\n\n\"The opinion, I think, was wrong, and I think the government should appeal it. It's deeply flawed in a number of ways,\" Barr said during an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n“Her decision is premature. And the dispute isn't over whether this document is potentially executive privilege and this one isn't. That's not the dispute. The dispute is whether the president – even if it is executive privilege – can the president bar DOJ from reviewing the documents? And the answer to that I think is clearly no.”\n\n\n\nWhatever the outcome of the DOJ's challenge, some legal experts said the delay brought about by Cannon's decision is already benefiting the former president.\n\n\n\n“Delay is sweet for a prospective criminal defendant, especially a prospective criminal defendant who doesn't seem to have any defense,” Jeff Robbins, a former federal prosecutor and congressional investigative counsel, told The Hill.\n\n\n\nMike Lillis and Morgan Chalfant contributed.",

        "description": "President Joe Biden won the 2020 Democratic nomination through the Black primary voters in South Carolina and carried the general election in November because of the strength of Black women voters. Yet, his top campaign staff was almost entirely white.\n\n\n\nIn fact, most political operatives are whiter, richer and more insulated from the struggles of everyday life than average people. This isn’t a guess, it’s what I was able to prove after I conducted original research on over 2,000 national-level political professionals. This is true for both parties, I learned, but it presents a fundamental problem for the Democrats that could impact their electoral prospects for years to come — the people who run the party’s campaigns have little in common with the vast majority of people whose votes they must win.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMy research shows that political work in America across both parties is deeply undemocratic: It’s exclusive, insular and unrepresentative. Campaign professionals too often see themselves as pro athletes or star coaches engaged in a high-stakes game. Only a select few get to play; the rest of us are welcome as spectators, but not on the field.\n\n\n\nThis is a particular problem for the Democratic Party, which has a brand inextricably linked to racial and economic justice. White people are over-represented among Democratic campaign staff: I found that roughly 70 percent of people working in the 2020 Democratic presidential campaigns were non-Hispanic whites, as compared with only about 60 percent of Democratic voters. White people held roughly 80 percent of roles in communications teams in these campaigns, crafting and delivering the messages voters receive. Further, all six of Biden's innermost 2020 campaign advisers were white.\n\n\n\nThe class mismatch is even starker. Nearly 95 percent of Democrats in national-level roles in 2020 had college degrees, compared with only 41 percent of Democratic voters. The most selective colleges and universities only enroll about 13 percent of all U.S. college students, but over 60 percent of the Democratic operatives in my data were alumni of elite schools like Princeton, Yale, Georgetown, UCLA or my own Swarthmore College — schools where the children of the 1 percent often outnumber those from the poorest 20 percent of households.\n\n\n\nTo be successful, many campaign staff and consultants told me they started by getting into a campaign through a personal or family connection, and then proving themselves through round-the-clock work with little or no pay. As one fundraising consultant I interviewed put it, “being involved in this type of work is almost like a luxury.” That path is unappealing or impossible for any young person who doesn’t come from a privileged family background or who needs financial security.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese disparities are not about skills: Campaign staff and consultants repeatedly told me that most campaign work can be — in fact, has to be — learned on the job. One operative told me her political science degree did “jack sh*t” for her work.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInstead, campaigns are losing out, turning away the cultural competence, strategic insights and deep understanding of the lives of everyday Americans that people from these communities would bring to campaigns.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany campaign professionals confessed to me that, despite all the polls and research at their fingertips, they are mostly guided by their “gut sense” of the right move. But these instincts and intuitions are shaped by their privileged view of the world, a view not shared by the voters they are trying to reach.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne former Democratic communications professional explained that campaign messages “seem so cookie-cutter” because “it’s the same people over and over again using the same methods and techniques.” He decried the “recycling of the same [BS] rhetoric on both sides” and said it leads to “running really mediocre campaigns.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat’s a big part of why, in my team’s interviews with nearly 200 poor and working-class people, we heard over and over again that politics feels disconnected from people’s daily lives. Working class people told us politics looked more like a game being played by elites than a way of making changes in the policies that shape their lives.\n\n\n\nEven in 2020, the highest-turnout election in a century, one-third of eligible voters stayed home. Non-voters are disproportionately people of color and lower-income people, and Democratic campaign professionals are consistently unable to mobilize more of them despite years of attempts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere have been some positive moves toward increasing representation in Democratic political work: The candidates and staff in the 2020 primary campaigns were the most racially diverse ever. New initiatives, such as the Arena Academy, have started that aim to recruit and train a more diverse pool of political operatives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut there are still too many barriers to real power, and the people of color who do get work in Democratic politics are too often isolated from leadership. Many are pigeonholed into “political” departments, where they are tasked with outreach only to their particular communities. One Latina staffer told me that campaigns will “only put [a Latino staffer] in states that have a sizable Latino population,” which can mean less opportunity for professional advancement.\n\n\n\nUltimately, these things should matter to anyone who cares about the policy goals of the Democratic Party, including many well-off white people like these campaign operatives and myself. If Democrats are going to hold power and deliver on promises to restore abortion rights, fight climate change or raise the minimum wage, they need to build campaigns that are made up of — and led by — the people they aim to represent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDaniel Laurison is an associate professor of sociology at Swarthmore College, a Carnegie fellow, and author of the recently published book “Producing Politics: Inside the Exclusive Campaign World Where the Privileged Few Shape Politics for All of Us.”",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/equilibrium-sustainability/3634284-rising-heat-pushing-key-earth-systems-toward-collapse-study/",
        "description": "Rising temperatures fueled by continued human emissions are pushing key earth systems from the Amazon rainforest to the Arctic ice sheet ever closer to collapse, a new study finds. \n\n\n\nThe paper published in Science on Thursday found that increased temperatures make it ever more likely that the earth will pass more than a dozen key “tipping points,” or thresholds beyond which earth systems break down or become unrecognizable.\n\n\n\n“The world is heading towards 2-3°C of global warming,” co-author Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said in a statement.\n\n\n\nSuch heating, he added, would set “Earth on course to cross multiple dangerous tipping points that will be disastrous for people across the world.”\n\n\n\nBurning fossil fuels accounts for about 92 percent of human-caused emissions in the U.S., according to the Energy Information Administration. The Biden administration has committed to setting the U.S. on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent below 2005 levels by end of decade. \n\n\n\nThe risk for the climate landscape gets dramatically worse above 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming — the limit world governments agreed on in the 2015 Paris Accords. But even 1.5 degrees Celsius is not necessarily enough to avoid these climatic tipping points, the scientists stressed.\n\n\n\nEvery piece of the emissions reduction puzzle matters, Rockström said.\n\n\n\n“We must do everything possible to prevent crossing tipping points. Every tenth of a degree counts,” Rockström said.\n\n\n\nAt today’s temperatures, five of the sixteen serious risks on their list are already possible, including the collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets; the breakdown of oxygen-giving oceanic circulation in the Labrador Sea; the massive die-off of coral reefs and the sudden thaw of methane-containing permafrost.\n\n\n\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas with dozens of times more heating power than carbon dioxide, which makes the permafrost thaw a particular concern as it could potentially lead to runaway warming, as Smithsonian reported.\n\n\n\nPermafrost peatlands in Europe and Siberia are on track to collapse by 2040, Nature Climate Change has found&nbsp; — making it just one of the tipping point scenarios already underway.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOther research published this week has raised the disturbing possibility that other tipping points detailed by the Potsdam team are looming.\n\n\n\nFor example, the Thwaites glacier — a keystone piece of the West Antarctic ice shelf — is on the verge of collapse, according to a study published in Nature on Monday.\n\n\n\nLast weekend, Greenland experienced melting across 35 percent of its surface —&nbsp;a first for September, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.\n\n\n\nAround 10 inches of sea level rise are “baked in” from Greenland’s melting regardless of whether emissions are cut, according to Nature Climate Change.\n\n\n\nFurther warming will turn these tipping points from possible to \"likely\" — and open the door for worse disruptions, the Potsdam team found — like the collapse of the West African Monsoon or the Amazon rainforest.\n\n\n\nThe Amazon&nbsp;is also in the midst of a “tipping point crisis,”&nbsp;according to a report this week by Amazon Watch, a team of Amazonian and international scientists. The group found that more than a quarter of the region is already undergoing the transition.\n\n\n\nThe climatic pressure on tropical landscapes like the Amazon is made worse by rampant deforestation for agriculture —&nbsp;which accounts for up to 99 percent of forest loss, according to a study in Science published on Thursday.\n\n\n\n“Many tipping elements in the Earth system are interlinked, making cascading tipping points a serious additional concern,” said Ricarda Winkelmann of Potsdam, one of the authors on the tipping points study, in a statement.\n\n\n\n“In fact, interactions can lower the critical temperature thresholds beyond which individual tipping elements begin destabilizing in the long-run,” Winkelmann added.\n\n\n\nThat makes governance and law enforcement in the Amazon and other tropical countries — as well as in polluter countries beginning to adopt climate measures — an issue of global concern.\n\n\n\n\"Strengthening forest and land-use governance in producer countries has to be the ultimate goal of any policy response,\" said Toby Gardner of the Stockholm Environment Institute, a co-author of the tropical deforestation paper.\n\n\n\n\"Supply chain and demand-side measures must be designed in a way that also tackles the underlying and indirect ways in which agriculture is linked to deforestation,”&nbsp;Gardner added.",

        "description": "Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Thursday said Russia’s strategic objectives in its attack on Ukraine have “been defeated.” \n\n\n\n“The war is not over, but so far the Russian strategic objectives have been defeated,” Milley said at a news conference alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.  \n\n\n\n“Despite being outgunned and outmanned, the Ukrainians have demonstrated superior tactical proficiency and they've demonstrated a superior will to fight, fight for their own country, fight for their freedom,”&nbsp;Milley added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRussia in April began an offensive in the eastern-most part of Ukraine known as the Donbas after failing to take the capital of Kyiv early in the invasion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMilley, who allowed that&nbsp;Moscow has achieved “minor tactical success in various parts of eastern Ukraine,”&nbsp;attributed the falters in the Kremlin’s offensive to unsuccessful operational objectives and “a very successful defense conducted by Ukraine.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“They have not achieved all of the Donbas, and they have only crossed the Dnipro River in the south in the vicinity of Kherson,” he said of Russian forces.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Ukrainian military, meanwhile,&nbsp;launched its own offensive to push back Kremlin troops around Sept. 1.\n\n\n\nMilley said it’s too early to fully assess that offensive near Kherson, but he noted Ukraine “is effectively using their fires to shape the ground maneuver” and has had “steady” and “deliberate” progress in the fight. \n\n\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken, meanwhile, who was in Kyiv for an unannounced visit on Thursday, said as he departed the country that the Ukrainian counteroffensive was “proving effective.” \n\n\n\n“Again, it's very early, but we’re seeing clear and real progress on the ground, particularly in the area around Kherson, but also some interesting developments in the Donbass, in the east, but again, early days,” he said, as reported by CNN.&nbsp;",

        "description": "World leaders are mourning the death of Queen Elizabeth II, Britain’s longest-serving monarch who died on Thursday at the age of 96.The loss quickly reverberated around the globe, particularly for the 15 Commonwealth realms, like Canada, for which the queen served as head of state.\n\n\n\n“It was with the heaviest of hearts that we learned of the passing of Canada’s longest-reigning Sovereign, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Twitter. “She was a constant presence in our lives — and her service to Canadians will forever remain an important part of our country’s history.”\n\n\n\nThe queen “died peacefully” at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, Buckingham Palace announced Thursday evening local time.\n\n\n\nThe announcement came hours after the palace said her doctors were “concerned for Her Majesty’s health,” placing her under medical supervision as her family canceled their public engagements and traveled to the castle.“Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II embodied the British nation’s continuity and unity for over 70 years,” French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted. “I remember her as a friend of France, a kind-hearted queen who has left a lasting impression on her country and her century.”\n\n\n\n\nHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth II embodied the British nation’s continuity and unity for over 70 years. I remember her as a friend of France, a kind-hearted queen who has left a lasting impression on her country and her century.&mdash; Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\n\n“She was a role model and inspiration for millions, also here in Germany,” said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. “Her commitment to German-British reconciliation after the horrors of World War II will remain unforgotten. She will be missed, not least her wonderful humour.”\n\n\n\nPresident Biden and first lady Jill Biden said in a joint statement that the queen “defined an era,” noting that they first met Elizabeth in 1982 during a Senate delegation trip to the United Kingdom.After coming to the White House, Biden became the 13th sitting U.S. president Elizabeth met over seven decades.\n\n\n\n“In a world of constant change, she was a steadying presence and a source of comfort and pride for generations of Britons, including many who have never known their country without her,” the first couple said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“An enduring admiration for Queen Elizabeth II united people across the Commonwealth,” the statement continued. “The seven decades of her history-making reign bore witness to an age of unprecedented human advancement and the forward march of human dignity.”\n\n\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he was “deeply saddened” by the queen’s passing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.K. is one of the military alliance’s 12 founding members, and the queen met with leaders during a NATO summit hosted in London in late 2019.\n\n\n\n“Over more than 70 years, she exemplified selfless leadership and public service,” Stoltenberg wrote. “My deepest condolences to the Royal Family, to our #NATO Allies the United Kingdom and Canada, and to the people of the Commonwealth.\n\n\n\n\nDeeply saddened by the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

She was the world’s longest serving Head of State and one of the most respected personalities worldwide.I offer my heartfelt condolences to the Royal Family and the British people. pic.twitter.com/6ASDFGSk43&mdash; Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\"She witnessed war and reconciliation in Europe and beyond, and deep transformations of our planet and societies,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. \"She was a beacon of continuity throughout these changes, never ceasing to display a calmness and dedication that gave strength to many.

Trump called Elizabeth an “incredible woman” ahead of his 2018 visit to Windsor Castle to meet with her.\n\n\n\n“What a grand and beautiful lady she was,” Trump said in a Thursday statement, “there was nobody like her!”\n\n\n\nFormer President Obama issued a lengthy remembrance of the queen just hours after her death was announced.\n\n\n\n“Michelle and I were lucky enough to come to know Her Majesty, and she meant a great deal to us,” Obama said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this May 25, 2011, file photo, President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama welcome Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip for a reciprocal dinner at Winfield House in London. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, File)\n\n\n\nThe ex-commander in chief highlighted his personal experience with Elizabeth during a 2009 visit to England.\n\n\n\n“Back when we were just beginning to navigate life as President and First Lady, she welcomed us to the world stage with open arms and extraordinary generosity,” Obama said.\n\n\n\n“Time and again, we were struck by her warmth, the way she put people at ease, and how she brought her considerable humor and charm to moments of great pomp and circumstance.”\n\n\n\nObama lauded Elizabeth for her “dedicated leadership,” saying he and the former first lady “are awed by her legacy of tireless, dignified public service.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this Saturday, June 4, 1994, file photo, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II smiles as she sits alongside President Bill Clinton at a dinner in the Guildhall in Portsmouth, England, commemorating the 50th anniversary of D-Day. (AP Photo/Doug Mills, File)\n\n\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton said he and his wife, former secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were joining with people “all around the world” in “giving thanks for [Elizabeth’s] life.”\n\n\n\nCalling the queen a “source of stability, serenity and strength,” the 42nd president said he was thankful “for the kindness she showed us through the years, particularly during our visits to Buckingham Palace in 1995 and 2000.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this May 7, 2007, file photo, President Bush and Queen Elizabeth II arrive to take part in arrival ceremonies on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington.

Bush recalled when he and wife Laura Bush spent time at Buckingham Palace, saying in a statement that “having tea with Her Majesty — and her Corgis — is among our fondest memories of the presidency.”\n\n\n\n“Our world benefitted from her steady resolve, and we are grateful for her decades of service as sovereign,” Bush said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this file photo dated May 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter, right, and Britain's Queen Elizabeth II are photographed with French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, at Buckingham Palace in London. (Pool Photo via AP, File)\n\n\n\nNinety-seven-year-old former President Jimmy Carter, who was born two years before Elizabeth, said he and wife Rosalynn extended their condolences to the monarch’s family and the citizens of the U.K.\n\n\n\n“Her dignity, graciousness, and sense of duty have been an inspiration,” Carter said of Elizabeth in a statement, “and we join the millions around the world in mourning a remarkable leader.”",

        "description": "King Charles III will deliver a televised address on Friday following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\n\nThe series of official protocols and rituals following the death of a monarch, known in the case of Queen Elizabeth as Operation London Bridge, includes an address by the new king and the prime minister. King Charles's address will be broadcast at 6 p.m. U.K. time, according to the Operation London Bridge plans. \n\n\n\nHe will be proclaimed king Friday by the Accession Council at St. James’s Palace, according to reports. Parliament will swear allegiance to King Charles and other parliamentary activities will be suspended for 10 days.\n\n\n\nThe newly ascended king put out a statement earlier today following the news of the queen's death, writing that the royal family is mourning the loss of “a cherished Sovereign and a much-loved Mother.\" \n\n\n\n“The death of my beloved Mother, Her Majesty The Queen, is a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family,” King Charles wrote.\n\n\n\nQueen Elizabeth II died on Thursday at the age of 96, after a 70-year reign.",

Cook, in response, suggested the attendee buy his mom an iPhone. “I don’t hear our users asking that we put a lot of energy in on that at this point,” Cook said.\nBlue versus green\nThis seems to be the first time Cook has publicly addressed RCS, the Rich Communications Services protocol.

        "description": "Continuing to heavily invest in its new partnership with established security company ADT, Google is adding to the $450 million it already put into the company in exchange for its 6.6% stake ownership a few years back. As reported on the ADT blog itself, Google is now committing another 150 million, bringing its total investment to a total of $300 million.\n\n\n\n&#x201C;A smart home should take care of the people in it while also helping to make sure they are protected and safe,&#8221;&#x201C;Our work with ADT is building the next generation of smart home security solutions.&#x201D;Rishi Chandra, Vice President and General Manager of Google Nest\n\n\n\nMany have wondered why no new Nest security devices have launched, and well, this is why. Nest has set its sights on ADT with hopes that it will be able to build smarter, and more secure technology. ADT has been around for nearly a hundred years doing what it does best, and I think that it&#8217;s wise of Google to go to the pros instead of continuing to make its own immature hardware and software to protect your most valuable assets &#8211; your life and the lives of your family as well as your belongings. This may be just my opinion, but I&#8217;m sure many would agree that Nest Secure was not the most reliable product.\n\n\n\nSource: ADT.com\n\n\n\nMore often than not, my security system would go offline, and the Nest Detect sensors would simply refuse to work for 8-12 hours at a time. After attempting everything to fix them, they magically re-enabled themselves and began doing their job again.\n\n\n\nThe $150 million Google is dumping into ADT (subject to the achievement of certain milestones) will be utilized for &#8220;co-marketing, product development, technology and employee training to advance the partnership&#8221;. Along with Google, State Farm is grabbing a 15% stake in ADT ownership by investing its own $300 million for similar purposes.\n\n\n\nI have to say that I&#8217;m excited for the possibility of a Nest-branded smart security system dropping in a few years time that&#8217;s chock full of Google smarts. Knowing that my home is protected by ADT, a long-standing and reputable company puts my mind at ease more than if I were to purchase something solely created by Google again. However, as with all things Google puts its fingers in, it creates concerns in its users about data collection and use. I don&#8217;t think this ADT partnership is any different, and I&#8217;ll be interested in seeing how this all plays out in the end.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CBS announced a new initiative that aims to recruit more actors with disabilities for roles as series regulars, guest stars or co-starring roles in current series and pilots. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwenty-six percent of the U.S. population lives with disabilities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly 4.2 percent of video content in the U.S. features a disability theme. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHollywood is taking steps to be more inclusive and is rolling out a new initiative that will give historically underrepresented performers, including those with disabilities, an opportunity to star in current TV series and pilots.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCBS announced a new program called The CBS Performers with Disabilities Talent Initiative that will launch in the 2022-2023 broadcast season. It aims to achieve meaningful representation and inclusion for all underrepresented groups in series regular, guest star or co-starring roles in current series and pilots. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nEligible candidates will have the chance to play characters specifically written with a disability or even for roles that don’t specify one.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere has been a growing demand for more representation in the media, with data from Nielsen showing 26 percent of the U.S. population lives with disabilities while almost 50 percent of people with a disability feel their group is underrepresented on TV.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNielsen also found that only 4.2 percent of video content in the U.S. features a disability theme — that represents feature films, TV movies, short films, TV series,&nbsp;sporting events and more.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat's still considered progress, because just a few years ago in 2019 there were 518 productions released featuring a disability theme. Through 2022 it’s jumped up to 6,895.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt's an issue CBS hopes to work on through its new initiative, acknowledging the much-needed exposure.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There are so many talented performers available who are often overlooked and are not being considered for roles, so our goal with this initiative is to help bridge that gap,” said Claudia Lyon, executive director of vice president of talent and casting at CBS Entertainment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a statement, CBS outlined that its initiative will include a casting 101 where performers will be able to attend a panel that offers career guidance on what casting directors are looking for during auditions, advice on getting headshots/resumes/demo reels and a Q&amp;A session with CBS executives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt will also include a series of acting workshops meant to give feedback and acting tips and a yearly open call in advance of each pilot season to consider new and up-and-coming performers with disabilities. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBeing more inclusive could be a smart investment for both networks and brands too, as Nielsen also found that the disabled community is 17 percent more likely to interact with a brand when its ads feature people from their community.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere have been notable strides, like with the film “CODA” which featured the story of deaf parents and their hearing child and went on to win an Academy Award for best picture. Troy Kotsur, one of the stars of “CODA,” even became the first deaf man to win an Oscar for best supporting actor. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe also featured its first deaf superhero in the “Eternals.”&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/yankees-place-dj-lemahieu-on-injured-list-2.html",
        "description": "The Yankees announced that infielder DJ LeMahieu is headed to the 10-day injured list, retroactive to September 5, with toe inflammation on his right foot. Miguel Andújar has been recalled from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to take his spot on the active roster. New York also reinstated starter Nestor Cortes from the IL after optioning out Deivi García following last night&#8217;s ballgame.\nLeMahieu has been out of action since Sunday dealing with the toe discomfort. He&#8217;s battled the issue off and on for a few weeks, and he&#8217;ll need at least another week off to recover. It certainly appears as if the discomfort has had an effect on LeMahieu&#8217;s performance, as he&#8217;s struggled mightily of late. Going back to the start of August 1, he&#8217;s hitting .187/.254/.243 through 119 trips to the plate. That&#8217;s obviously nowhere close to the .285/.389/.424 line he carried through the end of July. Precisely when LeMahieu started hurting isn&#8217;t clear, but he&#8217;s seemingly been operating at less than full strength.\nThe organization hasn&#8217;t provided a specific timetable for his return, although the fact that they&#8217;ve waited a few days to put him on the IL could suggest they don&#8217;t anticipate it being a long-term absence. New York also just lost Anthony Rizzo to the IL, though, leaving them particularly short-handed on the infield. They called up former Ranger first baseman Ronald Guzmán this week, and he started one of the club&#8217;s games in their doubleheader against the Twins yesterday. Utilityman Marwin González got the nod there in the nightcap, and he&#8217;s back in the lineup at first tonight. Gleyber Torres, Josh Donaldson (who&#8217;s currently on paternity leave), Isiah Kiner-Falefa, rookie Oswald Peraza and Andújar round out the healthy infield mix at the moment.\nThe silver lining of today&#8217;s news is that the Yankees welcome Cortes back from his own IL stint. He only missed a bit more than two weeks with a groin issue. The southpaw owns a 2.68 ERA through 131 innings on the season. He&#8217;ll make his 24th start of the year tonight against Minnesota.\nThe Yankees enter play Thursday holding a five-game lead over the Rays in the AL East. They&#8217;re five games back of the Astros for the top record in the Junior Circuit, seemingly setting themselves up to secure the #2 seed in the postseason. A second-half swoon has knocked the club off its once-historic pace, but they&#8217;ve still got a strong chance of securing a first-round bye.",

        "description": "Photo by Michael Owens/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Bombers’ infielder has been hobbled by a toe injury for weeks, so a period of healing could be a blessing in disguise. The number of Yankees on the injured list continues to grow, except this time the latest addition felt inevitable. The Yankees officially announced that they were placing DJ LeMahieu on the 10-day IL with the toe injury that has plagued their infielder for at least a month.\nThe placement is retroactive to September 5th, so the earliest he could return would be the Yankees’ series opener at Milwaukee September 16th. In a corresponding move, New York recalled Miguel Andújar from Triple-A while also activating Nestor Cortes for tonight’s game; Deivi García’s brief promotion lasted just one day.\nAndújar was already with the team after being called up as the 29th man for the doubleheader. He was officially returned to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre following the game, but remained with the major league team, and now we know why. \n\n\nPrior to tonight’s game, the Yankees made the following roster moves:•Reinstated LHP Nestor Cortes (#65) from the 15-day IL•Placed INF DJ LeMahieu on the 10-day IL (retroactive to 9/5) with right second toe inflammation•Recalled INF/OF Miguel Andújar (#41) from Triple-A SWB— Yankees PR Dept. (@YankeesPR) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\nLeMahieu joins a laundry list of Bombers already on the IL, including Anthony Rizzo and Andrew Benintendi. He had been dealing with this toe injury since at least August 9th (and likely earlier than that), and the offensive production was clearly suffering with a -13 wRC+ in 20 games dating back to that night’s contest against the Mariners. It’s not the first time we’ve seen LeMahieu’s performance dip while trying to play through an injury, and this stint on the IL could prove a blessing in disguise if the toe manages to heal some. \nIn the meantime, the Yankees will try to piece together their infield alignment while three of their starters are absent (LeMahieu and Rizzo on IL, Josh Donaldson on paternity leave). Andújar, Ronald Guzmán, and Marwin Gonzalez are all options to play first, with Gonzalez apparently emerging as the Yankees’ preferred choice. Although none of the trio have hit, Gonzalez’s 81 wRC+ and league-average defense at first are far more palatable than Andújar’s 39 wRC+ and Guzmán high-strikeout profile.\nElsewhere around the infield, this likely cements the trio of Gleyber Torres at second, Oswald Peraza at short, and Isiah-Kiner Falefa at third at least until the weekend (when Donaldson is expected to return). Further reps at short with the big league team could prove invaluable for Peraza, already the owner of a 121 wRC+ in his limited action so far. Additionally, we’ve seen how comfort at a defensive position can translate into production at the plate, so keeping Kiner-Falefa at his far more natural position of third might give the Yankees additional value.",

        "description": "Americans love royalty. We search streaming services for British shows about the monarchy, tour the United Kingdom to see the palaces and relish time throwing darts in pubs. Many of us watched celebrations of Queen Elizabeth II’s recent platinum jubilee marking seven decades on the throne and her meeting with the United Kingdom’s new prime minister, Liz Truss.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith the death of Queen Elizabeth II, we find ourselves reflecting on royal business and our fascination with the crown.\n\n\n\nThe queen’s family has been of great interest to the world going back at least to Princess Diana and her fateful trip to France, where she died in 1997 in a tragic car accident. Palace intrigue has always led to paparazzi swarming the royals. An estimated 2.5 billion people watched Diana’s funeral.\n\n\n\nWe have also followed the travails of Princes Edward, Andrew, William and, of course, Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who recently formally separated from the royal family.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo, what exactly did the queen do? And how do we really feel about having a monarchy?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt 96, her majesty was Britain's longest-serving monarch. She was a stable presence in the lives of Britons, reassuring them during World War II that all would be well in the world.&nbsp;She did the same during the recent challenges posed by Brexit and COVID-19.\n\n\n\nThe queen served an important global function. First, there’s the symbolism. Every passport in the United Kingdom is stamped with the queen’s name. And part of good public diplomacy is showing off your nation to the rest of the world.\n\n\n\nThe queen, as a public figure, placed her nation in a positive light, and is revered by most.&nbsp;Despite some negative press, she remained one of the most popular leaders in Europe.\n\n\n\nThere have always been scandals within the royal family and charges of mistreatment and smothering rules.&nbsp;But the queen was the country’s leading figure in charitable activities and represents some 600 good causes, including youth empowerment programs, public health and environmental and wildlife preservation.\n\n\n\nSecondly, the queen was often the person who said, “thank you.” She thanked countless soldiers, presidents and citizens, and there is nothing we need more today than gratitude.\n\n\n\nAt her platinum jubilee, the queen ended her public message by saying, \"I have been inspired by the kindness, joy and kinship that has been so evident in recent days, and I hope this renewed sense of togetherness will be felt for many years to come. I thank you most sincerely for your good wishes and for the part you have all played in these happy celebrations.\"\n\n\n\nLastly, the queen gave pomp and circumstance to government at a time when faith and confidence in government is low.&nbsp;Her duties included&nbsp;opening new sessions of Parliament and granting her royal assent to legislation.\n\n\n\nAt a time when Americans are debating whether anyone is “above the law,” it is fair to say that in the United Kingdom, the queen was the law; indeed, technically, she could not have been prosecuted for a crime.\n\n\n\nAs for Americans’ thoughts about the monarchy, most recent polls suggest we are royally ambivalent. On the one hand, we love royal romances. On the other hand, we bristle at the notion of royalty ruling over us.\n\n\n\nAnd like on most issues, the British monarchy divides us.&nbsp;Many Americans found the decision by Harry and Meghan to leave the Royal family disrespectful, leading to a drop in their popularity. But others praised the independence of the couple, citing aristocracy as a negative trait.\n\n\n\nRegardless of what you think about monarchies, it is sad to know that Queen Elizabeth II has died.&nbsp;The coming days and weeks will reveal how deeply she was loved by her nation and by so many people across the globe. At a time when the British – like so much of the world – are divided about so much, perhaps the queen’s death will unite the nation.\n\n\n\nI wish the queen's family, and her nation, well in these difficult days.\n\n\n\nTara D.&nbsp;Sonenshine&nbsp;is the Edward R. Murrow Professor of Practice in Public Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of International Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.",

        "description": "The Bank of England on Thursday clarified that paper money bearing Queen Elizabeth II’s image is still legal tender following her death.\n\n\n\n“As the first monarch to feature on Bank of England banknotes, the Queen’s iconic portraits are synonymous with some of the most important work we do,” the bank said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Current banknotes featuring the image of Her Majesty The Queen will continue to be legal tender,” the statement continued. “A further announcement regarding existing Bank of England banknotes will be made once the period of mourning has been observed.”\n\n\n\nBuckingham Palace announced earlier on Thursday the queen had “peacefully” passed away at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. The announcement came hours after the palace raised concerns over Elizabeth’s health.\n\n\n\nAndrew Bailey, the Bank of England’s governor, expressed “profound sadness” at the queen’s death in a statement.\n\n\n\n“On behalf of everyone at the Bank I would like to pass on my deepest condolences to the Royal Family,” Bailey said. “For most of us, she is the only head of state we have ever known, and will be remembered as an inspirational figure for our country and the Commonwealth.”\n\n\n\nKing Charles III, Elizabeth’s son, immediately ascended to the throne, but the timeline for any changes to Britain’s currency remains unclear.\n\n\n\nElizabeth ascended to the throne in 1952, but did not appear on banknotes for roughly her first eight years as queen.\n\n\n\nShe first appeared on the £1 note issued in 1960, and her image later appeared on other paper currency amounts, according to the Bank of England Museum. The image has also served as an anti-counterfeiting measure on paper currency.The end of Elizabeth’s seven-decade reign was marked with messages of mourning from leaders across the U.K. and the globe, including every living U.S. president.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/3634788-white-house-buys-100m-at-home-covid-19-tests-with-limited-funding/",
        "description": "The White House on Thursday said it had purchased 100 million rapid at-home COVID-19 tests with its \"limited funding,\" as the administration continues to call on Congress to pass more pandemic funds.\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration said in a press release that the 100 million domestically manufactured tests would be directed into the Strategic National Stockpile. White House officials had no further comment on the tests when reached by The Hill.\n\n\n\n\"While insufficient to adequately replenish our existing stockpile of at-home tests, this procurement will help meet some testing needs in the months ahead and will put us in a better position to manage a potential increase in testing demand this fall and winter,\" the White House said in its release.\n\n\n\nIt was announced in late August that the federal government would cease providing free at-home COVID-19 tests. At the time, the administration said this decision was made because \"Congress hasn’t provided additional funding to replenish the nation’s stockpile of tests.\"\n\n\n\nThe White House has kept up its calls for Congress to pass more funding, having requested $22.4 billion to combat the coronavirus pandemic earlier this month. \n\n\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said this week that there is currently an insufficient supply of COVID-19 tests in the national stockpile to handle another potential \"omicron-like event.\"\n\n\n\n“We had promised the American people we would make sure that we did not get into that, but we needed Congress to step up. Congress has not stepped up,\" Becerra said.\n\n\n\nHealth officials are hoping to avoid a major surge in cases this fall and winter with the rollout of the bivalent COVID-19 booster shots from Pfizer and Moderna. In order to fund vaccines and treatments for the upcoming seasons, the administration pulled funds from other areas of the pandemic response effort.\n\n\n\nThe rate of new coronavirus cases both globally and in the U.S. has been steadily declining in recent weeks, though experts have warned that it is still too soon to pull back mitigation efforts. Apart from the ongoing monkeypox outbreak, officials have expressed concerns that the flu season this year may be more severe than usual, citing early data coming from the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n\n\nDuring a press briefing this week, Becerra encouraged people to get vaccinated against COVID-19 as well as the flu at the same time.\n\n\n\n\"I really believe this is why God gave us two arms, one for the flu shot and the other one for the COVID shot,\" said Becerra.",

        "description": "Ugh, Rob. | Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  A pitch clock might speed up the game, but limits on defensive positioning and pickoffs are going to make MLB games different, and worse Well, my friends, it’s come to this. I regret to inform you that as entertaining as this season has been, even with the dreadful expanded playoffs... things may get much worse.\nIn short, as broken by Evan Drellich and Ken Rosenthal at The Athletic, MLB is set to pitch a comprehensive package of rules changes for the 2023 season and beyond. These rule changes, in total, will lead to a very different game when implemented. I say “when” because the structure of the 11-member “competition committee” (newly-formed as part of the most recent Collective Bargaining Agreement) includes six representatives from the league office, and only a majority vote is needed to enact the proposal. As such, unless some brave MLB employee wants to throw the switch and stop this trolley from careening off the tracks, we’re gonna be stuck with some awful changes.\nStarting with the least-bad elements, there will be a pitch clock of 20 seconds, or 15 seconds with the bases empty. There are a host of other sub-restrictions, with the main takeaway being that a violation by the pitching team results in an automatic ball, and a violation by the hitting team results in an automatic strike. \nThere’s nothing inherently problematic about this proposal in and of itself, as excising dead time is at least a noble goal. What isn’t particularly noble, though, is the ability for games to get derailed because of a pitch clock violation. Having a game be known as the “Pitch Clock Game” because a key plate appearance swung on taking 21 seconds instead of 20, per an umpire’s discretion, is something I hope never happens.\nI won’t go into all the details, but part of the pitch clock changes also involves “disengagements,” which refers to pitchers stepping off. It is unclear whether bona fide pickoffs count as disengagements. If they do, then pitchers only get two pickoffs, and the third is a balk unless it succeeds at throwing the runner out. If they don’t, then it’s far less consequential, but an MLB with only two pickoffs per plate appearance is basically going to be handing out free doubles to a bunch of batters. It’s also going to result in more pickoffs as nearly every runner pushes the pitcher to their limits, trying to get that sweet, free balk over to second.\nBurying the lede here, though, is that the big killer for my enjoyment of baseball is the shift changes. These aren’t benign, they’re extreme, and MLB appears to have taken a very blunt instrument to the idea that anyone could try and circumvent their restrictions.\n\nFour players have to have their feet on the infield dirt at the time a pitch is thrown. \nTwo players have to be on either side of second base.\nTeams have to specify which two fielders will play on which side of second base, and can’t alter them play-to-play or pitch-to-pitch. (No, I have no idea how this works with multiple substitutions moving guys around the infield, and I doubt MLB does either.)\nViolating these rules results in an automatic ball and a dead ball unless the batter reaches base. Sacrifice flies, bunts, and maybe some other results let the hitting team’s manager choose whether they want to accept the play (or, presumably, take a free ball).\nUmpires can penalize “attempted circumventions” of these restrictions with a free ball.\nPositioning can be challenged.\n\nAll in all, this is just a mess. I suspected that teams would try to circumvent more freeform shift restrictions, but now that umpires can just hand out free balls for getting a running start to cross the second-base bag, I’m not sure how viable that is. I also suspect that challenging fielder positioning is just going to be a huge boondoggle — can you imagine a replay review that eats a few minutes off the clock because a manager wanted to know if a fielder’s cleat was sufficiently to one side of second base? Oy. This is to say nothing of all the philosophical issues of not letting teams position players in a way they feel is most effective, we can get into that at some other point. In any case, this is just a disaster in the making, from a pure “avoiding stupid gameplay interruptions and outcomes” perspective.\nOh, and there are larger bases, too. Joy.\nI won’t rant and rave too much here, but the combination of expanded playoffs and these changes is a very clear signpost from MLB to me saying: “stop watching.” Am I going to listen? Who knows. But MLB is doing a great job of driving me away from a game that, until now, rewarded being diligent and clever in addition to strong and durable.\nYou can see all the changes here: https://theathletic.com/3578254/2022/09/08/mlb-2023-rule-changes-pitch-clock/, or probably somewhere else once they re-paste them from Drellich and Rosenthal’s work in full.",

        "description": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday approved the anti-wrinkle injection Daxxify, setting up competition for Botox, which has dominated the market for two decades.  \n\n\n\nManufacturer Revance Therapeutics said its studies show the drug can temporarily improve moderate to severe frown lines for about six months, almost twice as long a period as Botox. The company in a statement said Daxxify will expand its access to the growing $3.2 billion facial injectables market.\n\n\n\nRevance said Daxxify was generally safe and well tolerated, with no serious treatment-related adverse events reported in the clinical trials. The drug \"achieved clinically significant improvement with long-lasting results and high patient satisfaction,\" the company said.\n\n\n\nIn a study of more than 2,700 patients, 98 percent of them had no or mild wrinkles at four weeks after injection. The median effect lasted six months, with some patients seeing results for as long as nine months.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLike Botox, Daxxify is a neuromuscular blocking agent. Similar to other such products, the FDA warned its effects could spread to other areas of the body. The FDA also warned of the potential for general muscle weakness or breathing difficulties with the use of the toxin-based treatments, though with Daxxify the most common side effects were headaches and eyelid ptosis, a condition where the upper eyelid droops over the eye. \n\n\n\nRevance did not disclose the price of its injection, which it touted as the most significant advance in the field of facial injection drugs in 30 years.\n\n\n\nRevance said it is planning on rolling out Daxxify to high-volume injectors in the U.S., with an early training and education program at company headquarters in Nashville, followed by a broader commercial launch.",

        "description": "Even though Her Royal Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was 96 when she died Thursday, I find the news almost impossible to comprehend.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGrowing up as a college, and then graduate, student at the University of St. Andrews, where Will and Kate met, I found the Queen was a living part of every day. Her picture was ubiquitous, in every building. St. Andrews was a conservative place, with more than its share of the high-bred folks, all of whom were lesser planets orbiting around the sun that was the royal family. Even as I marched into the university’s fabled debate society to have at it with my competitors in front of thousands, a rousing “God save the Queen!” capped every Latin chant. Elizabeth II was everywhere.\n\n\n\nHowever, like something so omnipresent, it is easy to lose sight of what the Queen managed to personally do for the monarchy. In political risk terms — and I’ve taught the history of the British monarchy to British students, some who couldn’t believe that a mere American could fathom 1,000 years of their history — she has been one of the best rulers the United Kingdom has ever had.\n\n\n\nThree of Elizabeth’s characteristics stand out. First, and she learned this at the feet of her adored father, George VI: The Queen was a plodder, doggedly going ahead with her public relations duties, come hell or high water, whether she was happy or sad, fulfilled or neglected, popular or out of fashion. In her quiet, dutiful way, she followed in the footsteps of both her father and her grandfather, George V, two popular kings. The other branch of the Windsor family — typified by the callow Edward VIII, the Queen’s tragic sister, Margaret, and now by her grandson Harry, the Duke of Sussex — might be more fun to hang out with at a party, but none of them could be counted on to go the distance, serving their country day in and day out, whatever the social and political weather. Doing this over many decades rightfully made Elizabeth II a legend.\n\n\n\nSecond, Elizabeth understood that the magic of the monarchy meant that she carefully tended the distance between the rulers and the ruled. Prince Philip’s ill-advised foray into television in the late 1960s, ludicrously using a BBC documentary to feebly attempt to make the royal family look “ordinary,” flopped miserably, just as did the “It’s a Royal Knockout” game show in the 1980s, brainchild of Prince Edward, the Queen’s youngest son. In both cases, the Queen was outwardly loyal to her errant family, but must have inwardly cringed. Elizabeth understood that people do not want the monarchy to be “just like us.” For regal majesty to survive, there simply must be distance.\n\n\n\nThird, Elizabeth was rightfully a conservative in this most conservative of institutions. I am not talking specifically about her politics — which may well have been centrist — but rather how little her politics mattered. She knew, to the marrow of her bones, that the last thing the country wanted was a political monarch. The tragedy of her early life was precisely that her soon-to-be Nazi sympathizing uncle, David (Edward VIII), was far too outspokenly political for his (or former prime minister Stanley Baldwin’s) good. When Edward’s forced abdication to marry Wallis Simpson came about, Elizabeth’s brave but untested father, suffering from an almost debilitating shyness that came from his pronounced stutter, assumed a throne that both his wife and daughters came to believe killed him prematurely, thus setting the young Elizabeth on the throne.\n\n\n\nFor all these reasons her son, now Charles III, has an almost impossible act to follow. But worse, Charles’s present weaknesses will be painfully illuminated by his mother’s great strengths. Where Elizabeth talked about general duty to “the firm’s” basic public relations calling, Charles is more interested in either specific idiosyncratic projects (his decided views about architecture, or organic food) rather than the slog of opening regional swimming pools in Swindon. Where Elizabeth understood the majesty of monarchical distance, Charles talks unknowingly about making the whole edifice more accessible. Where no one knew the Queen’s political views, Charles is on record for hectoring ministers of all parties about their duty, which he seems to believe is to be a rather odd Liberal Democrat in his own image. All of this is dangerous, both for Charles specifically and for the furtherance of the monarchy as a whole.\n\n\n\nElizabeth II played her part so perfectly that, as the decades passed, she as an individual seemed to merge with the very institution of the monarchy itself; remember her first premier in the faraway 1950s was the great Winston Churchill. The problem with this is that the monarchy, as with every other great man-made institution, must be bigger than the person themselves; even kings and queens are just passing through while the Crown is forever. \n\n\n\nIn ruling so adroitly for so long, Elizabeth II’s success itself, and the ease with which she seemed to pull the whole thing off, makes following her little more than accepting a poisoned chalice. Her success will perhaps be Charles’s great problem.\n\n\n\nDr. John C. Hulsman is president and managing partner of John C.

        "description": "According to&nbsp;University of Michigan sociology Professor Elizabeth Popp Berman, progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) are “grounded in the values of rights, universalism, equity and limiting corporate power.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn her&nbsp;book, “Thinking Like an Economist: How Efficiency Replaced Equality in U.S. Public Policy,” however, Berman argues that economists and the economic way of thinking have been the bane of the progressive movement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne thing is certain: Progressives do not think like economists.\n\n\n\nEconomists, while not a homogeneous lot, generally are grounded in the laws of supply and demand and the recognition of opportunity costs and cost-benefit analysis. They believe that scarcity exists, that incentives matter and that economic efficiency provides broad benefits to society. All of these are rejected by progressives when public policies conflict with their \"values.” Berman claims that progressives have different ways of thinking.\n\n\n\nPresident Biden’s&nbsp;forgiveness of college debt, broadly&nbsp;supported by progressives, illustrates the difference. Shockingly, it violates two of their “grounded values”: universalism and equity. It&nbsp;worsens income inequality&nbsp;and targets a special-interest group that needs no subsidy. It also creates what economists call a moral hazard problem. A moral hazard can occur when a policy encourages riskier behavior for financial gain. Expect more borrowing for college and delays in repayment in anticipation of future government giveaways.\n\n\n\nBiden’s program also demonstrates the progressives’ disregard for opportunity cost. Simply stated, could the $1 trillion the program will cost have been put to better use?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Every dollar spent on student loan relief is a dollar that could have gone to support those who don’t get the opportunity to go to college,”&nbsp;tweeted&nbsp;Larry Summers, the distinguished Democratic economist and former Treasury secretary.\n\n\n\nAOC implied the opponents of the giveaway are&nbsp;selfish. Take that Larry Summers. She urged Americans to “reject the scarcity mindset that doing something good for someone else comes at the cost of something for ourselves.”&nbsp; By the same logic, perhaps we should subsidize indebted yacht owners. Kiss rational discourse and opportunity costs goodbye.\n\n\n\nTrue progressives, following universalism, support “free” college for everyone. Yet they are like chess players who cannot anticipate their opponents’ countermoves. Their game will not end well.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSanders&nbsp;supports&nbsp;legislation to “eliminate tuition and fees at public four-year institutions for those from families earning up to $125,000 per year and make community college free for everyone.”&nbsp;Exactly how many additional people would apply for “free” college? How much would this cost and how would it be funded? (“Free” college isn’t really free.) Would price controls and rationing eventually be imposed? How many families would reduce work to fall below the $125,000 cutoff? Checkmate!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nChina in the 1980s not only had free college but actually sponsored students to attend, as I observed as a Fulbright Professor in China in 1986. Progressives do indeed have a different way of thinking, and the laws of supply and demand do not enter into it. Politics and power do. \n\n\n\nThe Green New Deal provides yet another startling example of the rejection of economics by the progressives. According to many reasonable&nbsp;cost-benefit analyses, the Green New Deal will generate more costs than benefits. The program will be as economically wasteful as America’s Afghan War, no doubt.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAOC will be shocked to learn that the world will not end in 10 years, despite more greenhouse gases being generated in large part by&nbsp;China&nbsp;and&nbsp;India’s&nbsp;increasing use of coal. But the United States will be poorer and its lower-income people will hurt the most by rising heating and cooling costs. So much for equity.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the progressive value of universalism apparently does not apply to the health and environment of the Africans who are&nbsp;mining&nbsp;all the precious metals needed for our electric-vehicle batteries. If progressives have a sacred goal, no matter how much it might cost, an inconsistency with their “grounded values” is of little matter.\n\n\n\nThe world has benefited greatly from a 20th-century revolution when people thought like economists. Even the Chinese were able to pull&nbsp;hundreds of millions of their citizens&nbsp;out of poverty by doing just that. Nations that follow the thinking of progressives, rejecting basic economic logic, ensure travel down a darker path.\n\n\n\nBurton Abrams is a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Delaware and a research fellow at the Independent Institute in Oakland, Calif.

        "description": "Steph Chambers/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The White Sox gain a game back vs. projections, but given their lousy second-half start, they need to step it up to take the division We’ve been told all season long that the White Sox have an easy second-half schedule (they do) and will play better against lesser competition. \nBut we can’t get ahead of ourselves. The White Sox have played all season as if the division was handed to them in March, so we won’t make the same mistake here.\nThe following is an attempt to examine how the schedule will likely play out, updated as each series finishes up, every few days. \nI have tried to be evenhanded with these series matchups. The logic of Chicago getting swept in San Diego is that it’s a long second leg of a trip, after a demoralizing series loss in Minnesota, with the bolstered Padres fighting to host a playoff series. The White Sox also ran out of gas by season’s end in 2020 and 2021.\nWill Cleveland win five of six to end 2022? That’s tough to do, but the Royals will have much earlier cashed in their season, and the Guardians get nine games at home overall to end the year.\nThere are very few sweeps all told, so this presumes that the AL Central clubs, as bad as they are, never get too hot or too cold — until Cleveland at the end, the White Sox enjoy the hottest stretch, predicted to shoot from three games over at the end of August to 11 up heading into the home stretch.\nSo ... do the White Sox end up with the division title? \n\nHeading into the second halfTwins 50-44Guardians 46-44White Sox 46-46\n(all series are three games unless otherwise specified)\n\nFourteen series into the second half, the White Sox for just the second time of the second half have outplayed their projection, by winning a series in Seattle instead of losing it. Couple that with Cleveland and Minnesota keeping pace, and the White Sox actually gained one game of ground back, out of the hole they’ve dug.\nCleveland nearly kept pace with the White Sox, but blew a sweep in Kansas City in the ninth inning of the finale. \nMinnesota is three games down in their series in New York, and for the purposes of this piece it’s assumed they get away with a win on Thursday (big assumption). But worst case, the Twins will be merely even with their projection heading into a weekend series hosting first-place Cleveland, worst-case 2 1⁄2 games back. \nGuardians 86-76 (+ 1 vs.

        "description": "Photo by Mike Pont/FilmMagic\n    \n\n  Huzzah! The Cincinnati Reds have lost 80 games so far this season and are in 4th place in the National League’s Central Division.\nThe Chicago Cubs have lost 80 games so far this season and are in 3rd place in the National League’s Central Division.\nThings have never been tighter in the race for the most mediocre of accomplishments in baseball’s senior circuit this year, with the Reds comeback victory over Chicago on Thursday afternoon drawing the teams even in the loss column. Jonathan India singled in Alejo Lopez to give the Reds a 4-3 lead in the Top of the 9th after Lopez had tripled in the first run of the inning, and that was what it took to turn the tables once again in a game that had see-sawed throughout.\nChicago, unfortunately, has already put wins number 56 and 57 in their ledger so far this season, topping Cincinnati’s current 55 win total. So, the race for third place will have to wait for a few additional days.\nLuis Cessa was rather excellent in his start today for the Reds, by the way. He fanned 8 against nary a walk in 5.2 IP, allowing 3 H and a pair of runs on a day when CF TJ Friedl was completely lost in the sun chasing fly balls around. \nThe Reds will travel up the road to Milwaukee next and will begin a three-game weekend series at the park we still call Miller Park tomorrow evening. Someone will pitch. Someone else will pitch, too, since that’s just how this works.",

        "description": "The competition committee is set to vote on various proposed rule changes for the 2023 season, report Evan Drellich and Ken Rosenthal of the Athletic. A pitch clock, limitations on defensive shifting, pickoff limits and enlarged bases are all set to be formally voted upon tomorrow at 11:00 am CST.\nAs Drellich and Rosenthal note, it seems a mere formality that all the proposed changes will pass. The competition committee was established by mutual agreement between the league and Players Association during the most recent round of collective bargaining. It&#8217;s an 11-person panel designed to vote upon potential changes to the on-field playing rules. That committee is comprised of six league appointees, four MLB players and an umpire. Andy Martino of SNY reported in June that the league would be represented by Dick Monfort, John Stanton, Greg Johnson, Tom Werner, Mark Shapiro and Bill DeWitt for this round of voting. The players on the panel are expected to be Jack Flaherty, Tyler Glasnow, Whit Merrifield and Austin Slater (with Ian Happ and Walker Buehler as alternates), while Bill Miller will represent the umpires.\nWith MLB appointing a majority of the committee, it&#8217;s generally expected the league will be able to push through its desired changes with relative ease. (MLB had a unilateral right to change playing rules under the prior CBA, although it had been required to wait a full year after formally proposing it to the MLBPA in the event the union refused to sign off on earlier implementation). Under the current CBA, the committee can implement rules changes 45 days after making a recommendation to the union. That grace period won&#8217;t be relevant for this set of proposals, all of which are focused on 2023 and beyond.\nThe timing of the vote had been unclear, but it has seemed a formality for months that each of the pitch clock, a shift limitation and larger bases would be implemented by the start of next season. MLB had pushed for all three of those provisions at one point during CBA negotiations this past offseason. The parties eventually agreed to temporarily shelve any changes to the on-field product and focus on larger economic issues, but it has seemed inevitable since March that these three factors would be on the agenda (and would very likely be approved) for the 2023 campaign.\nDrellich and Rosenthal report the specifics on the proposed alterations. Pitchers would have 15 seconds to begin their delivery with no one on base, while they&#8217;d have 20 seconds to start their motion with runners aboard. The countdown begins when the pitcher has the ball, the batter and catcher are in the vicinity of home plate, and all baserunners are in an appropriate position. Catchers must be in position with no more than nine seconds remaining on the clock. If either the pitcher or catcher violates the provision, an automatic ball is called.\nBatters also have a time limit. They&#8217;re required to be in the box and &#8220;alert to the pitcher&#8221; with no more than eight seconds remaining on the clock. If he&#8217;s not prepared, an automatic strike will be assessed. (The league also has the authority to impose additional discipline on players and/or staff circumventing the clock). There are 30 seconds allotted between batters and 135 seconds between innings and for pitching changes.\nThe pickoff limit is also a pace-of-play measure. Pitchers are freely allowed to disengage from the rubber twice per plate appearance &#8212; whether to throw a pickoff or for any other reason. Doing so resets the clock for that pitch. A pitcher can disengage for a third time, but an automatic balk is assessed if the baserunner is not thrown out. Essentially, the disengagement rule limits pitchers to two &#8220;free&#8221; pickoff attempts per batter. After two unsuccessful step-offs, the pitcher can again attempt a pickoff but the baserunner would be awarded an automatic base if he&#8217;s not thrown out. If the runner advances without a ball put in play &#8212; via balk, stolen base, wild pitch, etc. &#8212; the pitcher&#8217;s disengagement limit resets.\nThe pickoff limit figures to incentivize more aggressive baserunning, at least among faster runners. Particularly once a pitcher uses his first two step-offs, a baserunner can theoretically extend his lead. The third disengagement means the runner won&#8217;t have free rein, but there&#8217;ll be more flexibility to push the leadoff knowing that another unsuccessful pickoff attempt is treated as a balk.\nTurning to the shift restrictions, teams would be required to deploy four players (not including the pitcher and catcher) on the infield. All infielders have to have both feet on the dirt, and two players must be completely on either side of the second base bag. A shift violation results in an automatic ball, unless it occurs on a ball in play or hit batsman. If the baserunner reaches anyway, the play stands. If there&#8217;s an out recorded, the batting team&#8217;s manager decides whether to let the play stand. In most instances, they obviously wouldn&#8217;t do so, although there are certain situations (i.e. a sacrifice fly) where teams may be content to accept the out for the advancement of other baserunners. Whether a team violated the shift ban is subject to replay review, while possible pitch clock offenses are not.\nThe league has experimented with the possibility of restricting shifts for quite some time in an effort to increase the batting average on balls in play. That has included some rather complex and extreme tests in the minor leagues. Jayson Stark of the Athletic reported in July that MLB was introducing a &#8220;pie-slice&#8221; restriction on shifting at the Low-A level. Not only did that require two infielders on either side of second base, it carved out a restricted area around the bag to prevent middle infielders from playing deep and just to their side of second base to take away would-be hits up the middle. That is not in the proposed rules changes for MLB in 2023, to be clear, but it illustrates the league might experiment with further defensive restrictions down the line if the initial shift ban doesn&#8217;t produce a desired uptick in base knocks.\nThe bases, meanwhile, would be enlarged from their current 15 inches square to 18 inches square. That&#8217;s a small change designed to facilitate more aggressive baserunning and minimize the chance of collisions on bang-bang plays at first.\nDrellich and Rosenthal report a host of other timing restrictions (on mound visits, in-stadium music, defensive timeouts, etc.) that would also go into effect if approved. The Athletic&#8217;s post is worth a full read for those interested in all the changes that seem likely to come to the majors next season.",

        "description": "Several dozen callers from the surrounding Twin Cities community have tipped off zoo officials to sightings of three missing birds who escaped the zoo’s tropical aviary in July but, unfortunately, none of these reports have panned out, zoo officials say.Now they are taking preventive action to ensure other tropical birds don’t get the chance to fly the coop.The zoo has removed all birds from the Tropics aviary and is “working on installing secondary systems for containment,” zoo spokesperson Mike Stephenson said in an email.Four female African long-tailed shrikes flew out of their Tropics aviary through an emergency exit door that was left open in the building, he said. Miraculously, one female shrike from the pack was later recovered and has been placed in quarantine.Stephenson did not address all the details of how the bird was found but did offer that “this individual was returned to the Minnesota Zoo and is currently being held at our Animal Hospital for quarantine and evaluation.” A team of veterinarians examined the bird and continue to monitor the shrike in quarantine. Each bird has leg bands used for identification.The zoo had asked the birding public last week to be on the lookout for the birds, also known as magpie shrikes. All four birds were born at the zoo in 2015 and 2020. Simone Maddox, a Ph.D student at the University of Minnesota, is a birder who studies the differences between bird populations in urban and rural areas. She believes they are close by because the weather in the Twin Cities is still warm. In comparison, the aviary temperature was set between 78 to 80 degrees.Maddox, who disclosed that she is not an expert on African long-tailed shrikes, said “if it was colder, that would push them south, but right now I don’t know if that is even in the cards.”She is pulling for the birds but couldn’t say for certain what the future holds for the magpies. The birds were in captivity, which might impact their survival outside the zoo.“They are used to eating a specific diet. They might be pickier than the average wild bird out there.”Maddox’s birder colleagues at the College of Biological Sciences are on the lookout for the birds, but she believes it will be a challenge to find them.“If you’re a birder out there, it’s something to think about, but the chances you’ll see them are pretty low.”",

        "description": "Labor Day has come and gone and so have the prospects for a landslide Republican victory in November.\n\n\n\nThe GOP quest to take control of Congress did not go gently into the Labor Day weekend. Just before the holiday, Republicans lost special congressional elections in Alaska and in upstate New York that they needed to win if they hope a significant majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n\n\nDemocrat Nancy Portola beat former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in a big upset in Alaska. She is the first Democrat to represent the state in the lower chamber for 50 years. A Democratic victory in a swing upstate New York district that former President Donald Trump won in 2016, and where President Joe Biden eked out a win in 2020, also came just before the holiday. Republicans now must beat both Democratic members in November to keep their dreams of House control alive.\n\n\n\nThe latest evidence that the big red wave has dissipated into a pink ripple on a pond comes from a new national survey conducted for the Wall Street Journal. The new poll conducted by the firms that worked for Trump (Fabrizio/Lee) and Biden (Impact Research) in the 2020 presidential election illustrates the dramatic change in the 2022 political environment since early this year.\n\n\n\nThe big red wave has crested and turned into a rising blue tide. The three-point Republican edge among registered voters in a generic congressional head-to-head in March turned into a five-point Democratic advantage just before Labor Day.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have gained, but the GOP is still in the driver’s seat because of Republican state legislative dominance in drawing districts. Because of gerrymandering, Democrats need at least this much of a lead in the national congressional vote to maintain control of the House. Biden’s party is on the rise but still has a way to go to keep control of the House. But the dreams of a big Republican majority have faded.\n\n\n\nThe situation on the Senate side is even more bleak for the GOP. Trump’s party is on the ropes with a field of troubled candidates like Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, J.D. Vance in Ohio and Hershel Walker in Georgia. These candidates carry lots of baggage and little cash for the stretch run of the campaign. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), the chair of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee feud publicly while their hopes for control wither on the vine.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the data from the Wall Street Journal survey suggests there have been two big factors in the revival of Democratic fortunes for the midterms. The first is Biden’s resurgence and the second is the debilitating impact of the Supreme Court’s abortion decision on Republican fortunes.\n\n\n\nA rising presidential tide lifts all Democratic boats. Back in March, Biden’s unfavorable rating was 16 points lower than his favorable score. In the new poll, his favorability deficit has dropped by half to 8 percent.\n\n\n\nNormally, a midterm election is simply a referendum on the incumbent president, but Trump just won’t get out of the way. His own vanity and investigations of the former president by the U.S. Department of Justice, the House investigatory committee on the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection and the New York attorney general have kept Trump in the spotlight as his popularity has faded. His popularity is now 16 points underwater, which means he’s in a hole twice as deep as his successor.\n\n\n\nLast week, Biden criticized the ex-president and his MAGA followers for the danger they pose to our American democratic legacy. Trump’s problems and rising negatives created an opportunity for Biden to attack his predecessor for his attempts to undermine the results of a fair election in 2020.\n\n\n\nA dramatic change in the issue environment on top of Trump’s legal jeopardy made it a long hot summer for his party. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court turned the tide against the GOP when the high court nullified Roe v. Wade and ended the constitutional right for legal abortions for millions of American women.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, inflation was the only issue that mattered and rising prices for gas took a terrible toll on Biden and his party. But a significant decline in prices at the pump and the unpopular Supreme Court Dobbs decision knocked the GOP for a loop.\n\n\n\nRoe’s reversal had such a dramatic impact that voters indicated in the Wall Street Journal poll that abortion has supplanted the economy as the issue that will them to the polls this fall. Republicans once looked forward to November with glee. Now, Democrats anticipate “Roevember” with heightened anticipation.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, the contest for control of Congress seemed like a walk in the park for the GOP. Now, it’s a street fight between the two parties. The dramatic change in the political environment highlights the danger of making political predictions before voters cast their ballots. There are many closely contested House and Senate races. But the GOP must reverse the current trends to realize the big hopes and dreams they enjoyed in January.\n\n\n\nBrad Bannon&nbsp;is a Democratic pollster and CEO of Bannon Communications Research.

        "description": "As soaring temperatures bring sleepless nights to households around the world, scientists are offering advice on how to sleep better and thereby mitigate the adverse health impacts of extreme heat.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCertain groups — older adults, children, pregnant women and individuals with psychiatric conditions — may be particularly vulnerable to the sleep-disruptive effects of heat waves, according to the researchers, who published their findings in the Journal of Sleep Research on Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe authors, from the EU’s European Insomnia Network, adapted several coping methods from elements of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile the researchers stressed that those with a history of sleep or health problems should always check with a medical professional, they offered some general tips.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSleep cool: Keep bedroom temperatures at a 66-degree-Fahrenheit constant. If this is not possible, keep them as close as possible to 68-77 degrees Fahrenheit.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey also advised using ventilators to cool down the bedroom — particularly fans, which consume up to 50 times less electricity than air conditioning.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRefreshment through evaporation: Before going to bed, take a cool or lukewarm shower, and cool the body temporarily with water sprays.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDrink lots of water: The scientists advised those suffering through heat waves to drink plenty of water during the day to help temperature regulation at night — and minimize the consumption of alcohol, as it inhibits sleep and causes dehydration.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKeep it regular: Finally, they advised that parents and caregivers keep children on a regular sleep schedule. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Equilibrium, a newsletter that tracks the growing global battle over the future of sustainability.

Then we’ll turn to a report on America’s so-called “highway boondoggles.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid heat and fire, Californians brace for hurricane\n\n\n\nAs sweltering temperatures bake California this week amid an unprecedented heat wave, southern portions of the state are bracing for the possible impact of a hurricane this weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA year’s worth of rain: Hurricane Kay is on a northbound trajectory in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Mexico and may inundate Southern California with a year’s worth of rain over just two days, according to CNN.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFlood watches are in effect for this region, as well as for western Arizona.&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm is expected to remain at hurricane strength until it’s about 250 miles from San Diego — joining just a handful of similar storms since 1950.\n\n\n\nBicoastal attack: As Kay approaches, another hurricane is headed for the Atlantic Seaboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;Hurricane Earl is currently passing between Bermuda and the Bahamas — possibly leading to “dangerous swells” hitting the U.S. East Coast by evening, according to the National Weather Service.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFlash floods, swells: An excessive heat warning remains in place for California through Friday night, but by the weekend, the heavy rains may begin falling, ABC Los Angeles reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHeavy moisture, including thunderstorms and possibly flash floods, could affect mountain areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Big swells could also form on local beaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor now, heat and fire: While an influx of precipitation may be in the forecast, Californians were contending with triple-digit temperatures and wildfires on Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFirefighters were struggling to gain control of several major blazes, including the Fairview Fire in Southern California, the Mosquito Fire in the Sierra Nevada and another incident in the San Bernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles, The Associated Press reported. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited invests $15 million in flying electric taxis  \n\n\n\nUnited Airlines has recently invested $15 million in a flying taxi company, The Hill’s Changing America reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Chicago-based airline’s investment in Eve Air Mobility follows other American aerospace giants’ forays into the “urban air mobility market.”&nbsp;American Airlines and Boeing each have a partnership with an electric air taxi company.\n\n\n\nComing soon: United is buying up to 400 electric aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing — similar to how a helicopter operates without use of a runway, and a must for the crowded cities where United hopes to deploy the vehicles.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSuch electric flying cars, long a staple of science fiction, could be winging above American cities by 2026, Changing America reported. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivists: Fix old highways before building new ones \n\n\n\nState use of federal infrastructure dollars to prioritize highway expansions over repairs could waste billions of dollars and worsen the impacts of climate change, activists argued in a new report.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRe-envisioning the future: The report, published on Thursday by the U.S. Public Interest Research Groups (U.S. PIRG), urged lawmakers to reconsider proposed forthcoming “highway boondoggles” proposed in their states.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Every time we spend money on infrastructure, we have an opportunity to re-envision the future,” Matt Casale, director of U.S. PIRG Education Fund’s environment campaigns, said in a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;“The projects that we choose to invest in should be ones that are going to make American lives better,” he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRevamping U.S. transportation: States have found themselves with funds to make such decisions following November’s passage of the bipartisan infrastructure law.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the infrastructure law, the report authors noted, gives states the flexibility to choose how best to spend much of the funds they receive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many states are already spending billions of dollars’ worth of new highway expansion projects, which the report authors argued would be better spent on attending to maintenance backlogs on existing roads.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExpansion projects at odds: U.S. PIRG Education Fund focused in Thursday’s edition on seven new highway \"boondoggles” that would cost a total of more than$22 billion:&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n$16 billion to widen the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway$2.8 billion to construct a 10-lane, double-decker bridge across the Ohio River$1.3 billion to build Maryland’s proposed Montgomery County M-83 highway$900 million plan to widen I-205 in Oregon$750 million to create an eight-mile bypass in southwestern Virginia$510 million to reconstruct I-35 in Minnesota$66-$100 million to redesign of the Erie Bayfront Parkway in Pennsylvania\n\n\n\nIndustry disagrees: While the report highlights highway expansion projects, aggregate data from the Federal Highway Association “tells a different story,” according to Brian Turmail, a vice president for the Associated General Contractors of America trade group.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“In the last 30 years, states have gone from spending about 50 percent of funds on highway expansion projects to less than 20 percent in 2019,” Turmail said in an emailed statement, noting that most of that expansion is concentrated in a few states.&nbsp;&nbsp;“This shows that states are already ‘fixing it first’ rather than expanding and building new highways,” he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo read about the proposed projects featured in the report, please click

Amazon to the Arctic ever closer to collapse, a new study has found.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne-way door: The paper, published in Science on Thursday, found that increased temperatures increase the likelihood that the Earth will pass more than a dozen key “tipping points.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The world is heading towards 2-3 degrees Celsius of global warming. This sets Earth on course to cross multiple dangerous tipping points that will be disastrous for people across the world,” co-author Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said in a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;“We must do everything possible to prevent crossing tipping points. Every tenth of a degree counts,” he added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBack to the accords: The risk of reaching such a scenario gets dramatically worse above 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit)&nbsp; — the limit world governments agreed to strive for in the 2015 Paris Accords.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe nations’ firm commitment was to 2 degrees Celsius — which is possible if nations keep their pledges, PBS News Hour reported.&nbsp;But even 1.5 degrees Celsiusis not necessarily enough to avoid many tipping points, the Science study stressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNo longer safe: The risk of triggering many climatic tipping points arose as soon as the planet reached 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, the scientists found.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt today’s temperatures, five of the 16 serious risks on their list are already possible, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCollapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets&nbsp;&nbsp;Collapse of oceanic circulation in the Labrador Sea&nbsp;&nbsp;The massive die-off of coral reefs&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden thaw of Arctic Circle permafrost&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe permafrost thaw is of particular concern, as it could potentially lead to runaway warming from the release of planet-warming methane, as Smithsonian reported.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNKNOWN RISKS AND DEFORESTATION ‘FOR NOTHING’ \n\n\n\nSeveral scenarios the scientists outlined are already underway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Thwaites glacier — a keystone piece of the West Antarctic ice shelf — is on the verge of collapse, per a study published in Nature on Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last weekend, Greenland experienced melting across 35 percent of its surface — a first for September, according to data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;Permafrost peatlands in Northern Europe and Siberia are on track to collapse by 2040, Nature Climate Change reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCompound dangers: Further warming will turn these tipping points from possible to \"likely\" — and open the door for worse disruptions, the Potsdam Institute team found.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese include the collapse of important earth systems like the West African Monsoon or the Amazon rainforest.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Amazon is currently in the midst of a “tipping point crisis,” according to a report this week by Amazon Watch, a team of Amazonian and international scientists.&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a quarter of the region is already undergoing the transition to Savannah. &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nPointless collapse: The climatic pressure on tropical landscapes like the Amazon is made worse by rampant deforestation for agriculture — which accounts for up to99 percent of forest loss, according to a study in Science published on Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe murders this week of two Indigenous ‘forest guardians’ by illegal loggers in Brazil’s Amazon highlights the lawlessness that accompanies and enables forest clearing, Reuters reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;As much as two-thirds of such cleared land never gets turned into productive farmland, the Science study found.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“A big piece of the puzzle is just how much deforestation is ‘for nothing’” coauthor Patrick Meyfroidt, of France’s University of Louvain, said in a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo read the full story, please click here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIRTUAL EVENT INVITE\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Infrastructure Summit,Wednesday,Sept. 14 at 1 p.m. ET\n\n\n\nImproved, sustainable infrastructure means cleaner water, safer roads, enhanced connectivity and a modern future.

Plus: a leading seafood certified marks most Atlantic lobsters “unsustainable.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStudy finds possible link between stroke rates, refinery pollutants&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResidential exposure to pollutants emitted by petroleum refineries could be related to the prevalence of stroke rates across the U.S. South, a new study covered by The Hill has found. Living near such refineries was potentially linked to 5.6 percent of strokes among adults surveyed in seven states across the region, according to the study, published on Thursday in Environmental Research Letters. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEthanol plants release more CO2 than gasoline refineries&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEthanol plants produce almost twice as much carbon pollution per gallon as the fossil fuels they replace, Reuters reported. While the fuel is intended to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the average ethanol plant released 1,187 tons of carbon dioxide per million gallons of fuel — compared to 500 metric tons for an equivalent amount of gasoline, Reuters reported. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThreat to whales makes many U.S. lobsters unsustainable&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLobster fishers will have to take heightened care to protect critically endangered right whales in order to avoid “red listing” by prominent fish sustainability group Seafood Watch, The Guardian reported. The finding builds on a July ruling by a federal court that the U.S. government had violated the law in failing to protect the whales from lobster fishing gear, which can entangle and kill them, E&amp;E News reported. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease visit The Hill’s Sustainability section online for the web version of this newsletter and more stories.

        "description": "Michigan voters will see an abortion rights question on the ballot in November, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled on Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe 5-2 ruling comes after the Michigan Board of State Canvassers last week deadlocked 2-2 along partisan lines, blocking certification of the sweeping amendment that if passed, would enshrine abortion rights into the state's constitution after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the right at the national level in June.\n\n\n\nThe deadline to finalize the ballot is Friday.\n\n\n\nThe Republican members of the board voted against adding the amendment to the ballot because of typographical errors. The anti-abortion group opposing the effort argued that due to missing spaces and other formatting errors the text circulated to voters for their signatures was too confusing, making the petition invalid.\n\n\n\nThe majority wrote that despite the typos, the meaning of the amendment was not changed.\n\n\n\n\"Regardless of the existence or extent of the spacing, all of the words remain and they remain in the same order, and it is not disputed that they are printed in 8-point type. In this case, the meaning of the words has not changed by the alleged insufficient spacing between them,\" the court ruled.\n\n\n\nMore than 750,000 people signed the proposal, far more than the roughly 425,000 required to qualify for the ballot.\n\n\n\nA 1931 state law makes it a crime to perform most abortions, but the law was suspended in May, and a judge this week struck it down as unconstitutional.\n\n\n\nAside from Michigan, abortion questions are on the ballot in Kentucky, California, Vermont and Montana, the most abortion-related ballot initiatives ever seen in a single year.",

        "description": "Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon pleaded not guilty on Thursday to charges that he defrauded donors to a project meant to fund the construction of a border wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBannon is facing charges in New York of money laundering, conspiracy and scheming to defraud after prosecutors alleged that he directed money that donors gave to We Build the Wall Inc. toward paying the salary of the president of the organization and for personal expenses.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBannon has criticized the investigation as being politically motivated, saying “this is all about 60 days from the day,” referring to the November midterm elections. He said federal prosecutors did the “same thing” to him when they charged him in a similar case ahead of the 2020 presidential election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer President Trump pardoned Bannon for federal charges related to the wall-funding project in January 2021, before the case against his former top adviser went to trial.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) said at a press conference on Thursday that Bannon and organizers of the project advertised through media appearances, emails and social media posts that “not a penny” would go to paying the salary of the group’s president.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut prosecutors say that the president, Brian Kolfage, received a salary of more than $250,000 funded by donations, and that at least $140,000 of which came from money that Bannon laundered. They also say he used some donations to cover personal expenses.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nProsecutors also filed charges against We Build the Wall as an organization.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwo other men, including Kolfage, an Air Force veteran, have pleaded guilty to charges related to the project, and a mistrial was declared in the case against a third defendant. \n\n\n\nBannon could face up to five to 15 years in prison if convicted.",

        "description": "Benny Sieu-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Burnes strikes out 14 in dominant outing. Box Score\nIn a doubleheader, good performances from the pitching staff is a major factor in getting through the day. Corbin Burnes ensured that the Brewers would have that, as he pitched eight innings with 14 strikeouts as the Brewers took game one of their doubleheader over the Giants 2-1.\nBurnes pitched well all day. He came out strong with five strikeouts in the first two innings, with only one baserunner allowed (a hit batter in the second inning). Burnes did run into trouble in the third inning, allowing a two-out single to LaMonte Wade Jr. Mike Yastrzemski followed that with a double to bring in Wade Jr., giving the Giants an early 1-0 lead. After that, he went back to domination, allowing just one more single the rest of his start. He pitched eight innings in total, striking out 14 and walking none. He allowed just the one run and three hits, as well as the one hit batter.\n\n\nBurnes master class.Watch all 14 of his strikeouts, plus the final out from his 8 innings of work.#ThisIsMyCrew pic.twitter.com/nz4L4vruhc— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the offense started slow, going down in order the first time through the lineup. In the fourth, they got the bats going. Jace Peterson led off the fourth with a single, then stole second. Christian Yelich brought him in with a double, and Hunter Renfroe brought Yelich in with another double. The Brewers had a chance to put up a big inning with an Andrew McCutchen walk after that, but Rowdy Tellez grounded into a double play to end the inning. However, the Brewers had a 2-1 lead.\nFrom there, the Brewers only managed one more baserunner the rest of the game (a Tellez walk), but Burnes made sure the two runs would hold up. He then turned it over to Devin Williams for the ninth, and he pitched a 1-2-3 inning to end the game and secure the Brewers 2-1 win.\nThe Brewers will head into game two right away, with a 6:15 PM first pitch time. Freddy Peralta will start for the Brewers in game two.",

        "description": "Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Can’t anyone in this bullpen throw strikes? It was an absolutely gorgeous afternoon at Wrigley Field Thursday, with temps in the low 80s, unlimited sunshine, a light lake breeze, the kind of day you’d like to bottle up and let it out in January when Chicago really needs it.\nAnd for six innings, the Cubs baseball matched the weather, an excellent outing from Adrian Sampson and just enough runs to go into the seventh with a lead.\nSampson faced 21 batters, threw 75 pitches (55 strikes) and didn’t walk anyone.\nThe Cubs bullpen... uh, they weren’t good. Five Cubs relievers faced 19 batters, threw 87 pitches (only 44 strikes) and issued six walks, one of the biggest reasons the Reds came back and won an ugly game 4-3.\nNeither team scored over the first four innings and the Cubs turned a pair of double plays, which helped Sampson out of early jams. \nHere’s one of those double plays; it ended the fourth inning [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nSampson retired the Reds 1-2-3 in the fifth and then the Cubs took a 1-0 lead. Nico Hoerner led off with a triple to center and P.J. Higgins drove him home with this fly ball [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nAlfonso Rivas followed that with a single and then as he took off for second, Nelson Velázquez struck out, upon which everyone left the field. That was confusing because the strikeout was only the second out of the inning, but Velázquez was called for batter interference, so Rivas was ruled out to end the inning.\nIn hindsight, that might have been an important play, as Rivas would have been in scoring position with two out and the top of the order up. Maybe he scores, maybe he doesn’t.\nSampson threw a 1-2-3 sixth and then the Cubs extended the lead in the bottom of the inning. With two out, Seiya Suzuki doubled and scored on this single by Franmil Reyes [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was 2-0 heading to the seventh and not only had Sampson pitched well, but the game was breezing along, possibly on pace to end before 4 p.m.\nThat... didn’t happen. The Cubs bullpen was just awful. A home run leading off the seventh off Sampson by Kyle Farmer made it 2-1 and David Ross went to the pen. No one threw well. Brandon Hughes allowed a single and walk, didn’t give up any runs but had to be bailed out of the inning by Manuel Rodriguez. In the eighth it got worse, with Rodriguez issuing a one-out walk and after recording the second out, allowing a single.\nThat brought in Rowan Wick, who couldn’t throw strikes at all. He walked the first batter he faced, loading the bases. Then he walked the second hitter he faced, forcing in the tying run. If you’re counting, we’re up to four walks already from the Cubs pen and they’ve thrown fewer than two innings. Wick did get out of the inning with the score still tied.\nSuzuki gave the Cubs the lead back with one out in the eighth [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s the one good takeaway from this game, apart from Sampson — Suzuki continuing to hit the ball with authority. He doubled and homered in this game, the homer his 12th, and his OPS of .773 is at its highest point since July 31. I’d really like to see him finish the year strong, possibly getting that OPS over .800.\nSo the Cubs had a one-run lead going to the ninth.\nMark Leiter Jr. was summoned for the save opportunity. Another walk, the fifth by the pen, led off the inning. After a sacrifice bunt, a triple to right-center tied the game, and one out later, a single by Jonathan India past a diving Zach McKinstry gave the Reds the lead. Michael Rucker was next in line, and just for good measure, he walked the first batter he faced, so three of the five Cubs relievers accomplished that dubious feat.\nThe Cubs did get the tying run on base in the ninth on a single by Higgins. P.J. had the following results of his four PA: Hit by pitch, sac fly, sac bunt, single. There have been only five other players in MLB history who have had that exact four-PA nine-inning game, the last one another Cub, Doug Glanville in 1997. Here’s the entire list. (Note that this is only since sac flies became an official stat in 1950.)\nJust trying to lighten things up here with a bit of trivia after an awful performance by the Cubs bullpen. Jed Hoyer has been good over the last couple of years at identifying relievers who can help the team. Hopefully, he can do that again — many of the guys in the pen now are likely not going to make it to 2023’s Cubs roster.\nHere’s some numbers backing that up:\n\n\nThe Cubs' bullpen ranked 27th in MLB in ERA (5.20) since the Trade Deadline going into today. After a quality start from Sampson (6+ IP, 5 H, 1 ER, 0 BB, 1 K), the relief corps has allowed 3 R on 4 H with 6 BB and 3 K in 3 IP.Reds grab 4-3 lead in 9th.— Jordan Bastian (@MLBastian) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\nAnd that was BEFORE today’s disaster.\nAttendance watch: The announced crowd was 23,910, the lowest number of tickets sold this year. In the house? Maybe 13,000 or so. The last time the Cubs had a crowd this small under full capacity (which excludes 2021) was September 4, 2013, when only 20,696 paid to see the Cubs defeat the Marlins 9-7.\nOnward to another game and series. The Giants come to Wrigley Field for a three-game set beginning Friday afternoon. Note, Friday’s game time is 3:05 p.m. CT. Drew Smyly will start for the Cubs and Carlos Rodon will go for San Francisco. TV coverage will be via Marquee Sports Network.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3635036-the-debate-over-esg-investing-lots-of-hot-air/",
        "description": "As climate scientists analyze the boiling summer of 2022, I’ll eagerly await their findings. How much can we attribute to increased fossil fuel use caused by the economic recovery? And how much can we attribute to the record levels of hot air being spewed by reactionary conservative politicians about environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing?\n\n\n\nThis summer, Texas began implementing a law requiring state pension funds to divest from firms its comptroller views as hostile to the fossil fuel industry. Setting aside the merits of this policy, its botched rollout provided exactly the kind of regulatory uncertainty that capitalists from both parties agree really kills jobs.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Florida’s Republican governor led a resolution to prevent state pension funds from considering ESG factors in investment decisions. I wonder how this was received by the 14,900 employees of Florida-based energy giant NextEra, which has its 2022 ESG report and promise of a “real plan for zero” front and center on its website.\n\n\n\nESG investing is hard to define. But, in general, it places other priorities — reducing inequality or increasing diversity, for example — on equal footing with financial returns. In recent years, ESG has been closely identified in the public mind with the fight against global warming. If you have been living under a rock for the past 10 years, first of all, congratulations on your super low-carbon lifestyle. Second, you might ask: Why is this even a category? Doesn’t any business decision include factors other than pure financial returns?\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, HSBC’s Stuart Kirk gave a now infamous speech “Why Investors Need Not Worry About Climate Risk” at an ESG conference. Kirk, then the head of responsible investment and research at&nbsp;the bank, complained about the amount of work involved in calculating climate risk. His take on the climate crisis’ predicted hit to GDP growth was “who cares?” He cited the average loan term at his bank (six years) and said, “what happens to the planet in year seven is actually irrelevant to our loan book.”\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, he was soon relieved of his duties at HSBC. Last week he resurfaced in the pages of the Financial Times with a fascinating editorial.\n\n\n\nKirk’s criticisms, however, shed light on a paradox at the heart of ESG.\n\n\n\nMost of the people whose job it is to raise and invest money under the ESG label are “input” focused. That means they take ESG factors into account when making investment decisions with the ultimate goal of risk-adjusted returns. Most of their clients, however, are “output” focused. That means they expect an ESG fund that touts its green credentials to completely eschew fossil fuel stocks and steer capital into renewable energy companies.\n\n\n\nSome, like Kirk, suggest that regulators and practitioners split ESG in two along this input/output axis. They argue this would bring greater clarity to the industry and allow ESG to reach its potential.\n\n\n\nI work in the field of sustainable and responsible business. I am the president of a certified B Corporation and a Ph.D. candidate in the field of sustainability. When I speak to my clients, their priority is always on output. They ask: How can the financial products and professional services you provide help me build more affordable housing and create more jobs in my community?\n\n\n\nAs an output-focused investor, I admit I’m probably oversimplifying the very hard task facing my input-focused fund managers. The job of an ESG manager sounds very difficult. In fact, it is hard to be in any relationship when the other partner has difficulty articulating what they want.\n\n\n\nHere is what I want: I want the market value of the companies that are heavily invested in resolving the climate crisis to grow. I want them to have access to the capital they need to hire the smartest people in the world, to invest in the best technology and to communicate to their customers and communities about how to use it as effectively as possible. I do not want to be an owner of a company — remember, that is what investors are — that is heavily invested in making our problems worse.\n\n\n\nBut here is what I want even more: I want reactionary conservative politicians to dispense with the easy political stunts and engage with the hard work required to lead us out of this crisis. Because at the end of the day, investment choices and consumer decisions — even in the billions of dollars — are no substitute for sound public policy. I want leaders to use incentives and constraints to fundamentally change the world markets in which fund managers invest my money. And, ultimately, I want ESG to become meaningless — not because it suffers from the lack of definition, but because based on changes in policy and culture we will have moved sustainability to the center of all business decisions.\n\n\n\nPhil Glynn is president of Travois — a certified B Corporation that finances housing and economic development in Indigenous communities.

        "description": "Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), said “vultures” in the media are trying to divide Republicans after multiple national outlets published stories detailing a feud between Scott and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\n\n\n“As is predictable for this time of year, the vultures in the left-wing news media — The Washington Post, NY Times, CNN and the like — are roaming about trying to divide and defeat Republicans,” Scott wrote to the NRSC’s email distribution list.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“As always, they are being aided by the typical Washington ‘anonymous sources’ whose cowardice is only exceeded by their ignorance,” he continued.\n\n\n\nIn recent months, McConnell and Scott have levied criticism against one another about the party's campaign strategy that has only grown as the party’s chances of flipping the Senate in November appear to shrink.\n\n\n\n“The fact is that Republicans are on the verge of taking over both the Senate and the House, and the left is panicking,” Scott said in the email.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Scott introduced a controversial policy agenda for if Republicans took control of the chamber. Republican senators previously said McConnell warned Scott at a February leadership meeting that his agenda would become a political liability. &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe agenda, dubbed “Rescue America,” included proposals that Democrats, who quickly attacked the plan, said would potentially sunset programs like Social Security and Medicare.\n\n\n\nIn August, McConnell noted that Republicans have a better chance of flipping the House than the Senate in this year’s midterms, citing concerns over “candidate quality.”\n\n\n\nThe remark came after several candidates backed by former President Trump won Republican nominations in key Senate battlegrounds like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Ohio.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMcConnell has long stressed the importance of electable nominees, but the NRSC stayed out of this year’s primaries. Scott acknowledged to Politico late last month that he and McConnell had a “strategic disagreement,” arguing the party had “great candidates.”\n\n\n\nScott in his latest email called NRSC primary involvement an “urban legend.”\n\n\n\n“This year, because President Trump endorsed in many primaries, some of the self-appointed smart guys in Washington demanded that I insert the NRSC into primaries against his candidates,” Scott said. “This would have meant spending dollars raised by Republican donors against Republican candidates.”\n\n\n\nScott has also come under criticism for taking a vacation to Italy last month and his expensive attempt to expand the NRSC’s online donor pool.\n\n\n\nIn the email, Scott pushed back on those attacking the new strategy, saying the initiative “undoubtedly produces a tremendous return on investment” and noting it has already netted more than $11 million and will be more valuable in the future.\n\n\n\n“Democrats have consistently outraised Republicans in digital fundraising,” he wrote. “This had to change – and the only way to change it was to make early investments to get new donors, which we did and it worked.”\n\n\n\nA New York Times analysis found that Scott’s NRSC raised $181.5 million by the end of July but spent 95 percent of it, leaving the committee with far less cash on hand than Senate Democrats’ campaign arm.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the email, Scott acknowledged that the NRSC spent over $45 million in advertising prior to Labor Day, but argued the early spending was “crucial.”\n\n\n\n“Many of our candidates finished bruising primaries with no money in the bank,” Scott wrote.&nbsp;“The NRSC helped our candidates with early ads, and we’re proud that nearly every candidate ad that was on the air this summer had assistance from the NRSC. We will continue to do this through election day.”",

Plus, we’ll talk about House Republicans’ ‘grave concerns’ regarding President Biden’s use of Marines during his speech in Philadelphia last week.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is Defense &amp; National Security, your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond.

Subscribe here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS sending assistance countries at risk from Russia \n\n\n\nThe United States intends to send another $2 billion in military support to Ukraine and 18 nearby countries at risk of Russian attack, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Thursday during a visit to Kyiv.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA new weapons package: Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also on Thursday announced another package of weapons to Ukraine worth up to $675 million, a pledge made as he met with allies working to keep Ukraine equipped “over the long haul” amid the Russian invasion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA list released by the Pentagon detailed the contents of the package, including:\n\n\n\nFour 105mm Howitzers and 36,000 accompanying artillery roundsammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS)additional High-speed Anti-radiation missiles (HARM)100 Humvees50 armored ambulancesAnti-tank systemsSmall arms&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe further $2.2 billion: Both the Pentagon and State Department also announced that the Biden administration has informed Congress of its “intent to make a further $2.2 billion available in long-term investments under Foreign Military Financing to bolster the security of Ukraine and 18 of its neighbors; including many of our NATO Allies, as well as other regional security partners potentially at risk of future Russian aggression.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRoughly half of that money will go toward Ukrainian security and the other half split between Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nState of war: Ukrainian forces are working to push Russian troops from the northeast part of the country around Kharkiv and in the south near Kherson, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday highlighting “good news” about recapturing unnamed settlements from the Kharkiv region.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Russia is showing no sign of backing down, with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday defiantly claiming his country has “not lost a thing” from the war in Ukraine and the tight sanctions it has triggered.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nU.S. officials, meanwhile, estimated in August that Russia has suffered around 70,000 to 80,000 casualties in under six months.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the full story here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP concerned about Biden's use of Marines\n\n\n\nHouse Republicans told the Department of Defense that they are “gravely concerned” about President Biden using Marines as “political props” during his Sept. 1 speech in Philadelphia.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the lawmakers said it appeared that the Marines “participated in a political event” that “jeopardizes their compliance” with Pentagon regulations against participating in political activities while in uniform.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWho wrote the letter? The letter was signed by House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), House Armed Services Committee ranking member Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) and House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense ranking member Ken Calvert (R-Calif.).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA point of debate: Biden’s use of the Marines during his speech sparked debate, with many who liked the president’s remarks criticizing the positioning of Marines behind him during a speech that was largely seen as political.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre later insisted that Biden had the Marines there out of respect for the military and its role in defending democracy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe demands: In their letter, the lawmakers asked Austin to respond to questions regarding his knowledge of Biden’s use of the Marines during the speech.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey asked if anyone in the Defense Department knew of the contents of Biden’s speech before he gave it, if the agency knew that two active-duty service members would be involved and what guidance was given to the White House regarding their participation in the event, among other things. “You’ve expressed your concern about politicization of the military and have insisted the military will not become a political instrument under your watch. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened with the participation of the Marines at this political event,” the lawmakers wrote. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPENTAGON EXPEDITES TIMELINE FOR RED HILL DEFUELING \n\n\n\nThe Department of Defense submitted a new plan to Hawaii state officials for defueling the bulk fuel storage facility at Red Hill in Hawaii, expediting the timeline by several months.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a statement released late Wednesday, the Navy said it now projects completion of defueling by July 2024, several months faster than its December 2024 estimate released in June.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Navy said that the new timeline condensed repair time, determined that certain activities could be done in parallel, and reduced the duration of the final phase of defueling from eight months to roughly five months.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatchdog evaluating claims about Afghan evacuees\n\n\n\nThe Department of Defense’s watchdog told two Republican senators that it will evaluate claims that hundreds of Afghan evacuees were allowed to enter the U.S. despite being on the department’s watchlist.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“As part of our ongoing body of work on Afghan evacuees, we are initiating an evaluation, to commence in the first quarter of [fiscal year] 2023, to address your questions pertaining to the DoD’s role in reviewing DoD databases for information on Afghan evacuees when requested by other agencies,” acting Pentagon Inspector General Sean O’Donnell wrote in a letter to Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) obtained by The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe evaluation will also look into claims that officials at the National Security Council and Department of Defense “did not follow proper procedures when processing evacuees in Afghanistan and at staging basis.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBackstory: O’Donnell was responding to an Aug. 4 letter from the two senators regarding allegations they received from a Pentagon whistleblower. The senators said the whistleblower had told them that the administration evacuated 324 individuals from Afghanistan who appeared on the agency’s watchlist. The whistleblower claimed that those evacuated included “known suspected terrorists.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe senators also said the person claimed that White House and Defense Department officials directed agency personnel to not conduct fingerprint tests of Afghan evacuees and that Department of Homeland Security staff were authorized to delete old biometric data regardless of whether staff believed the data was out of date.&nbsp;“This information may show the Biden Administration’s failure to vet those evacuated from Afghanistan was even worse than the public was led to believe. The following allegations demand an immediate investigation by your office,” the senators said at the time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat the watchdog has done: O’Donnell’s letter only addressed the concern about the evacuees entering the U.S. despite being on the Pentagon’s watchlist, and he referred their other questions to other agencies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe agency’s evaluation will come as part of its “ongoing body of work” on evacuees. It released two reports regarding Afghan evacuees this year — one evaluation on the screening of Afghan evacuees in February and another audit on the Pentagon’s support for relocating Afghan nationals.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nO’Donnell noted that the agency is also evaluating “security and life support practices for Afghan evacuees at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the full story here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nON TAP FOR TOMORROW\n\n\n\nThe third day of the 2022 Billings CyberSecurity Summit will begin at 9 a.m. The Hudson Institute will host a discussion on “Chinese Economic Decoupling Strategy against the United States” at `0 am. The Brookings Institute will hold a discussion on “The role of veterans in strengthening our democracy” at 4 p.m. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nDOJ appeals special master ruling in Trump documents probe Milley: Russian strategic objectives in Ukraine ‘have been defeated’  Biden sparks debate with Marine backdrop to combative address \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it for today!

        "description": "Queen Elizabeth II died today at the age of 96, ending the longest reign of any British monarch in history. A double rainbow formed over Buckingham Palace as mourners gathered outside.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nToday in health, the Department of Homeland Security did away with a Trump-era rule that limited immigration of people who may have relied on social services such as Medicaid.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWelcome to Overnight Health Care, where we’re following the latest moves on policy and news affecting your health.

Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDHS unwinds Trump-era public charge restrictions \n\n\n\nThe Biden administration on Thursday finalized a rule to replace a Trump-era policy that sought to limit immigration of those it feared may rely on social services.\n\n\n\nThe new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy rolls back the Trump administration’s so-called public charge rule, restricting immigration pathways for those seeking to become U.S. citizens only if they are “primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.”&nbsp;The Trump administration’s rule said that anyone who needed benefits like Medicaid, food stamps, or housing vouchers for more than 12 months were considered a “public charge” and were more likely to be denied a green card.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This action ensures fair and humane treatment of legal immigrants and their U.S. citizen family members,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a release.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration stopped defending the Trump-era rule just months after taking office. The new rule also departs from the Trump-era policy requiring prospective new citizens to forecast whether they might rely on government aid at any time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExperts said the Trump rule put a chilling effect on people who weren’t directly affected, and discouraged permanent residents and even U.S. citizens from using benefits like medical care over concerns it might keep them from obtaining legal status.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services also praised the changes, calling Medicaid, and its program for children, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), essential services.&nbsp;“People who qualify for Medicaid, CHIP, and other health programs should receive the care they need without fear of jeopardizing their immigration status,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a release.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House buys 100M at-home COVID tests\n\n\n\nThe White House on Thursday said it purchased 100 million rapid at-home COVID-19 tests with its “limited funding,” as the administration continues to call on Congress to pass more pandemic funds.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration said in a press release that the 100 million domestically manufactured tests would be directed into the Strategic National Stockpile. White House officials had no further comment on the tests when reached by The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNot enough: “While insufficient to adequately replenish our existing stockpile of at-home tests, this procurement will help meet some testing needs in the months ahead and will put us in a better position to manage a potential increase in testing demand this fall and winter,” the White House said in its release.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt was announced in late August that the federal government would cease providing free at-home COVID-19 tests. At the time, the administration said this decision was made because “Congress hasn’t provided additional funding to replenish the nation’s stockpile of tests.”&nbsp;The White House has kept up its calls for Congress to pass more funding, having requested $22.4 billion to combat the coronavirus pandemic earlier this month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said this week there is currently an insufficient supply of COVID-19 tests in the national stockpile to handle another potential “omicron-like event.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We had promised the American people we would make sure that we did not get into that, but we needed Congress to step up. Congress has not stepped up,” Becerra said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFDA OK’S LONGER-LASTING BOTOX COMPETITOR  \n\n\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved the anti-wrinkle injection Daxxify, setting up competition for Botox, which has dominated the market for two decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nManufacturer Revance Therapeutics said its studies show the drug can temporarily improve moderate to severe frown lines for about six months, almost twice as long a period as Botox. The company in a statement said Daxxify will expand its access to the growing $3.2 billion facial injectables market.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRevance said Daxxify was generally safe and well tolerated with no serious treatment-related adverse events reported in the clinical trials. The drug \"achieved clinically significant improvement with long-lasting results and high patient satisfaction,\" the company said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOME THERMOMETERS MAY BE LESS ACCURATE IN BLACK PATIENTS\n\n\n\nA study of more than 4,000 patients found that Black patients are less likely to get an accurate reading with a forehead thermometer than with an oral thermometer.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nForehead thermometers take temperatures using infrared radiation. Whether the devices can pick up the radiation can be affected by something called skin emissivity. Skin emissivity is how much light, radiation and heat is emitted by the skin and can be affected by skin pigmentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a study from Emory University, researchers look at data from 2014 to 2021 for about 2,000 Black patients and 2,000 white patients. They had their temperatures taken by both forehead and oral thermometers within a short time span on their first day in the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor Black patients, the chances of detecting a fever with a forehead thermometer was 26 percent lower than with an oral thermometer. There were no significant differences for white patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPossible consequences: Missed fevers in Black patients can lead to delayed diagnosis and potentially increased risk of death down the line.\"\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberals push Biden on marijuana reform   \n\n\n\nDemocrats are beginning to pressure President Biden to take on marijuana reform as Congress struggles to find a path forward on decriminalization and as the party contemplates what’s possible before the midterms.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLiberals have been building momentum with just two months until the November elections with back-to-back wins on key pieces of Biden’s agenda, from student loans to health care and tax reform.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nForward progress: “Now that the president has delivered on a progressive policy of student debt relief, he has seen an uptick in the polls, he’s united the base, put Republicans on the defensive and Democrats across the country seem to be riding the wave as well,” said Stacey Walker, an influential Iowa Democrat and former surrogate for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who focused on cannabis reform during the “unity task force” negotiations between the Biden and Sanders camps in 2020.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA group of Democratic senators recently sent a letter to Biden urging him to act on marijuana legalization. Their request to Biden followed what they described as a “disappointing” explanation from the Department of Health and Human Services that argued “cannabis has not been proven in scientific studies to be a safe and effective treatment for any disease or condition.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There is about 36 states in this country that currently have active medical marijuana programs that have thousands and thousands of individuals in them that are benefiting from its therapeutic use,” said Erik Altieri, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nAdvocates wanted Juul’s big settlement to overhaul the e-cigarette landscape.

        "description": "Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Yankees can sweep the Twins right out of New York, with Nasty Nestor back on the hill. I don’t know if the Twins are the cure for what ails the Yankees, but they’ve certainly been able to treat the club’s symptoms this week. New York has won all three of the previous games in this series, sweeping a doubleheader yesterday, and can continue their near-farcical dominance of the Twinkies tonight behind Nestor Cortes.\nAll season long, Cortes and Gerrit Cole have gone back and forth as the nominal Yankee ace, and Nestor will now be asked to follow Cole’s 14-strikeout performance last night. He’s making his first start since returning from the IL with a bum hamstring, but his 2.68 ERA and 3.40 FIP on the season should make us all confident that he can handle the Twins tonight. He did, however, have a mediocre start against Minnesota back in June, going 4.1 innings and allowing four runs on a pair of long balls.\nManager Aaron Boone did say that Cortes will be on a pitch count tonight for his first start in two and a half weeks, so keep an eye out for that. The bullpen will probably factor in, and Clarke Schmidt is available if needed.\nSonny Gray is a familiar face for Yankee fans, but he’s taken major steps forward this season since being traded from Cincinnati in the offseason. He’s shaved down his walk rate in three straight seasons,  He doesn’t strike out as many batters as he used to, but an increased ability to manage contact and induce ground balls and soft popups has served him well this year.\nThe Yankees are sending quite the odd lineup on Thursday night, with Aaron Hicks leading off and Isiah Kiner-Falefa batting cleanup after two homers earlier in this series. Rookie Oswald Peraza and Estevan Florial are in, but Oswaldo Cabrera will be on the bench. Jose Trevino also gets the night off after catching 12 innings yesterday. Marwin Gonzalez starts again at first base and with DJ LeMahieu now on the IL, the recently-recalled Miguel Andújar will DH.\nHow to watch\nLocation: Yankee Stadium — Bronx, NY\nFirst pitch: 7:05 pm ET\nTV broadcast: YES, Bally Sports North, TBS\nRadio broadcast: WFAN 660/101.9, WADO 1380\nOnline stream: MLB.tv\nFor updates, follow us on Twitter and Instagram, and like us on Facebook.\n\n\nNestor Night. #RepBX Presented by @Hilton pic.twitter.com/YLNvYgay4j— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nOne more in New York. #MNTwins pic.twitter.com/iUHLnt2IrI— Minnesota Twins (@Twins) September 8, 2022",

        "description": "Daniel Craig reprises his role as Benoit Blanc in Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery. \nWe loved director Rian Johnson's delightful 2019 hit film Knives Out as much as anyone. So we've been eager to learn more about the upcoming sequels commissioned by Netflix. Fortunately, the streaming platform just dropped the first teaser for Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery—and per Johnson, it's less of a sequel and more of a new standalone mystery featuring Daniel Craig's philosophically minded Kentucky sleuth Benoit Blanc. Based on the teaser, it looks fabulous, and we can't wait for the film's release later this fall.\nKnives Out premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was an instant hit, and word of mouth spread quickly. The film ended up grossing $311 million worldwide—the top-grossing film in 2019 not based on existing IP. In my review, I praised Johnson's deft ability to mix dark subject matter with a lighter touch in his old-school classic whodunnit: \"Think Clue meets Murder on the Orient Express—or any number of adaptations of novels by the grande dame of murder mysteries, Agatha Christie—both of which the director cited as influences via a 2019 Twitter thread of movie posters.\"\nSo naturally there was going to be a sequel... or two. Lionsgate originally took on the project, but in 2021 Netflix won a bidding war for the rights to the film plus a second sequel, beating out both Amazon and Apple with a whopping $469 million bid. Johnson wrote the script for Glass Onion during the pandemic, inspired particularly by the Christie-based \"tropical getaway\" whodunnit Evil Under the Sun (1982), as well as a 1973 film called The Last of Sheila.Read 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge / \"You do you\" when it comes to masks on NY transit.  (credit: MTA)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority faced immediate backlash Thursday after unveiling a new mask-optional policy featuring the tagline \"You do you\" below a silly cartoon of a person improperly wearing a mask over just the nose, not the mouth.\nGenerally, the new policy lifts the MTA's previous requirement that riders wear a face mask—properly. Earlier signage showed a cartoon person correctly wearing a mask, with the tagline \"That's the one!,\" after several examples of how not to wear a mask, including over just the nose. The requirement and the sign came with the slogan: \"Stop the spread. Wear a mask.\"\nPrevious MTA signage for mask wearing. (credit: MTA)\nBut the new guidance dramatically flips the collective-effort messaging to a more individual-based approach to public health, with the slogan: \"Masks are encouraged, but optional. Let's respect each other's choices.\" The new signage repeats the same cartoon examples of how not to wear a mask for protection but now labels them all as acceptable.Read 10 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

The FBI is now offering a reward of $100,000 for information leading to his arrest, up from the $10,000 it offered in September 2020.\nPratt is wanted \"for his alleged involvement in sex trafficking and production of child pornography,\" the FBI said yesterday. Pratt and others who did not evade capture were accused of \"a conspiracy to recruit young adult women and minor girls to engage in commercial sex acts by force, fraud, and coercion.\"\nFrom 2012 to 2019, Pratt owned and operated GirlsDoPorn and GirlsDoToys, which generated more than $17 million in revenue, the FBI said. \"Locating Pratt is a high priority for the FBI in order to stop him from victimizing anyone else,\" Special Agent in Charge Stacey Moy said.Read 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Aurich Lawson / Getty Images)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver Labor Day weekend, one of the biggest online security services providers, Cloudflare, made what it called a “dangerous” decision to block access to one of its most controversial customers, an increasingly violent alt-right web forum called Kiwi Farms.\nThe decision came two weeks into a pressure campaign dubbed \"Drop Kiwi Farms,\" which was launched by Clara Sorrenti—online alias “Keffals”—a transgender activist and Twitch streamer among those targeted most venomously by Kiwi Farms. The goal was to protect people like Keffals and fight back by forcing Cloudflare and other Internet service providers to stop enabling Kiwi Farms’ escalating attacks on trans people and other vulnerable communities.\nCloudflare held out for weeks as the pressure campaign raged on social media. But then, within a 48-hour period, Cloudflare noted that Kiwi Farms users were growing increasingly aggressive and had started doxxing and swatting victims. (Doxxing is when someone publishes private information to incite violence against a target, and swatting involves placing a hoax call reporting imminent suicide or gun violence to police so they descend on targets with force.)Read 33 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.Queen Elizabeth II, who died today at age 96, was a “north star” for her subjects through seven decades of transformation. Our London-based staff writer Helen Lewis corresponded with me this afternoon about the late monarch’s singular legacy.But first, here are three new stories from The Atlantic.\r\n\tThe Queen of the world\r\n\tThe right to free speech is not the right to monologue.\r\n\tThe man who chased history\r\nThe Silent SovereignSeventy years, seven months, and two days into her reign as Queen of the United Kingdom and its 14 Commonwealth states, Queen Elizabeth II died today at Balmoral Castle. Helen Lewis writes that, as the oldest and longest-serving British monarch in history, Elizabeth was an institution in her own right—a cornerstone of the wartime foundation of modern British identity, and a rare point of continuity through an era of nearly unimaginable change. Helen told me over email about what today’s loss means for Britons, and what comes next.Kelli María Korducki: You write that even as the world changed around the Queen, she remained in place as a kind of north star for Britons. What did that mean, especially in the final years of her reign?Helen Lewis: At 96, Queen Elizabeth was older than all but 150,000 Britons—she felt like someone who had been around forever. She was also a link back to the Second World War, which is the founding mythology of modern Britain, when we stood up against Hitler and had our “finest hour.” When COVID happened, she did a national address that referenced a famous song from the war, promising that we would “meet again.”Kelli: The late British journalist Dermot Morrah pointed out in 1958—a mere six years into Elizabeth II’s reign—that the British monarchy stands out as one of the few institutions in history to have relinquished power, by choice. You write that, in Morrah’s view, “moving to a realm beyond politics has only made it”—the monarchy—“more special.” How so?Helen: Politics in the U.K., particularly since having the Scottish and Brexit referenda, has felt bitterly (and evenly) divided. But it was notable that the Scottish National Party, who wanted independence, still wanted the Queen as their head of state. She was an institution, which gave people a sense of continuity and stability.Kelli: As you note, Elizabeth’s reign coincided with a shrinking of the British empire and the emergence of a postcolonial age. How did that shift change the role and perception of the monarchy?Helen: It’s very striking to look at the booklet issued for Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation in 1953 and see how many of the countries mentioned there either don’t exist or have been renamed. The world in which her reign began simply doesn’t exist anymore.There have been some extremely awkward moments this past year, like when William and Kate went to the Caribbean and had to face high republican sentiment—and when Prince Charles had to sit through an independence ceremony for Barbados next to Rihanna. As a family, they have had to confront the decline of deference and the fact that many people in other countries see them as symbols of imperialism, colonialism, and oppression.Kelli: Throughout her reign, the Queen maintained a high level of public respect and admiration, even as republican sentiment—and specifically anti-monarchism—grew in Britain and across the commonwealth. What was so special about Elizabeth that distinguished her, in the eyes of many, from the institution she represented?Helen: She was silent. She very rarely gave interviews and never expressed a political opinion. (Although a couple of times, politicians suggested what she thought: that she backed Brexit or opposed Scottish independence.) That allowed everyone to “own” her equally.On the other hand, King Charles, if that’s what he ends up being called, has strong and well-known opinions: He hated brutalist architecture, championed organic food, and lobbied politicians in a series of secret letters that came to be known as the “black spider memos,” named after his terrible handwriting.Kelli: What happens now?Helen: There is a period of official mourning. (I’m writing this from a cinema, which just sent everyone home.) The TV schedules have been wiped for the foreseeable future. The tabloid newspapers will be on high alert for any left-wing comedian that says anything which vaguely approaches disrespect. A state funeral will happen relatively soon, and then eventually a coronation. That may take a while; Elizabeth took the throne in 1952 but wasn’t crowned until 1953.Related:\r\n\tQueen Elizabeth’s unthinkable death\r\n\tPhotos: The remarkable life of Queen Elizabeth II\r\nToday’s News\r\n\tThe federal grand jury investigating the lead-up to the January 6 insurrection and push to overturn the election results has issued a subpoena seeking more information about Donald Trump’s leadership PAC, Save America.\r\n\tIn an attempt to quell record inflation, the European Central Bank has raised interest rates by three-quarters of a point, the biggest hike since 1999.\r\n\tSteve Bannon surrendered to the Manhattan district attorney’s office today and pleaded not guilty to charges of money laundering, conspiracy, and fraud.\r\nDispatches\r\n\tWait, What?: Sarah Palin’s failed run for office in Alaska might foreshadow the future of Trumpism, Molly Jong-Fast writes.\r\n\tDeep Shtetl: Yair Rosenberg argues that Donald Trump neutralizes even Joe Biden’s most glaring weaknesses.  \r\nEvening Read\r\n(Erik Carter / The Atlantic; Getty)\r\nWe Living Things Are an Accident of Space and TimeBy Alan Lightman\r\nLike many people on planet Earth, I have been spellbound by the first pictures from the James Webb Space Telescope: the lacelike windings of galaxies, the apricot filaments of nebulae, the remnants of exploded stars. A less picturesque, but still revolutionary, part of Webb’s mission is the search for signs of life elsewhere in the universe. The telescope goes about this momentous quest by analyzing the starlight passing through the atmospheres of distant planets. Each kind of molecule leaves its own telltale imprints on traversing light, and some molecules, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane, may indicate life forms on the planet below. Indeed, Webb has already found evidence of carbon dioxide on at least one planet beyond our solar system.\r\nRead the full article.More From The Atlantic\r\n\tWhat’s missing from empathy\r\n\tThere’s no escaping the truth about Trump.\r\n\tThe iPhone used to mean something.\r\nCulture Break\r\nRalph Angel Bordelon, Darla, and their son Blue, from \"Queen Sugar.\" (OWN Communications)\r\nRead.

Despite the somber occasion, I am pleased to be making my first contribution to the Daily.Reading Helen’s essay, I was struck by an observation from the late Dermot Morrah, who wrote in 1958 that it’s difficult to comprehend the “monarchy as a way of life” for those who don’t live within one. As an erstwhile midwesterner turned commonwealth émigré, I would agree with that assessment. I lived in Canada for more than 11 formative years (a story for another day). For a nontrivial portion of my life, Elizabeth II’s likeness was emblazoned on the currency I exchanged for boxed mac ’n’ cheese (Canadians call it Kraft Dinner), her photograph silently presiding over my bureaucratic transactions. I presumed that I would one day swear an oath of citizenship to the Queen of Canada (yes, really), and tweet drolly about it afterward.But eventually, as her de facto subject, I came to appreciate the Queen—the way a person sometimes does—by dint of sheer exposure. And then there’s this delightful 2015 Vanity Fair feature about Her Majesty’s corgis. Today seems as good a time as any to give it a read.— KelliKate Lindsay contributed to this newsletter.",

        "description": "HP Pavilion x360 14 models in various modes, including tablet at the end | Image: HP\n    \n\n  Microsoft is reintroducing its tablet-friendly taskbar in the latest preview of Windows 11. The taskbar was first introduced in February alongside other new features included for eventual rollout in Windows 11, but it was later pulled for more internal development. Microsoft said in a blog post that the taskbar is part of an update rolling out to Windows Insiders in the developer channel and is only available for PCs that can be used as tablets like 2-in-1s, not laptops or desktop PCs.  \nThe taskbar itself is designed to be hidden when a tablet user isn’t using it, allowing more needed screen space. When it’s collapsed, it shows “critical” things on it like the time and battery percentage. When it’s expanded, it reveals several apps,...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "Lest we forget\n\nThree Stolpersteine — literally ’stumbling stones’ on the pavement outside an apartment block in Berlin, commemorating three people who had been taken from the house and murdered in Auschwitz and Chelmno. One finds these lovely memorials all over the place — and not only in German cities.\n\nQuote of the Day\n\n”The first rule of intelligent tinkering is to save all the parts.”\n\n\nPaul Ehrlich \n\n(And, this blogger adds, take photographs as you dismantle the device with which you intend to tinker.)\n\nMusical alternative to the morning’s radio news\nJ.S. Bach | Erbarme Dich | St Matthew’s Passion | Jonathan Peter Kenny (Counter-tenor), Clare Salaman (Violin), Thangam Debonnaire (Cello).\nLink\nThe clip is from a remarkable production directed by Jonathan Miller, who can be seen talking about it here in his usual mesmerising way.\nMany thanks to Seb Schmoller for the link and the background.\n\nLong Read of the Day\nWhat does GPT-3 &#8220;know&#8221; about me?\nInteresting article by Finnish journalist Melissa Heikkilä in MIT Technology Review reporting what she discovered when she started asking Large Language models like GPT-3 questions about herself — and others. Since these models are trained on troves of personal data hoovered from the internet she wondered what they knew about her.\n\nIf you’ve posted anything even remotely personal in English on the internet, chances are your data might be part of some of the world’s most popular LLMs.\nTech companies such as Google and OpenAI do not release information about the data sets that have been used to build their language models, but they inevitably include some sensitive personal information, such as addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses.\nThat poses a “ticking time bomb” for privacy online, and opens up a plethora of security and legal risks, warns Florian Tramèr, an associate professor of computer science at ETH Zürich who has studied LLMs. Meanwhile, efforts to improve the privacy of machine learning and regulate the technology are still in their infancy.\nMy relative anonymity online is probably possible thanks to the fact that I’ve lived my entire life in Europe, and the GDPR, the EU’s strict data protection regime, has been in place since 2018.\n\nBut when she started asking the models about relatively public figures, things got really interesting.\nDo read it to find out.\nFootnote: Out of idle curiosity I started asking OpenAI’s text-davinci-002 model questions about me. On the grounds that I have been a blogger forever and a newspaper columnist since the 1980s I figured the model would have some information about me. Turns out I was wrong.\n\nComments:\n\n\nI’m not a British journalist, though I live and work in Britain. I’m also an academic (a professor) but that didn’t figure in the model’s knowledge base.\n\n\nI do write for the Observer\n\n\nI have four children, not two, and one of them is named Pete\n\n\nI was not born in ‘Dublin, Ireland’ but in Mayo.\n\n\nI am not married to Emma Duncan\n\n\nSo a success rate of one out of five.\n\nMy commonplace booklet\nThe outsized power of small acts of kindness\nI’ve always thought that generosity is a good default mode in life, but until I read this piece in Axios I didn’t know there was academic research to back that up.\n\nThe researchers conducted a series of experiments with different acts of kindness — such as offering someone a ride home or covering the cost of someone&#8217;s cup of coffee. In one experiment, study participants at an ice skating rink in Chicago on a cold winter day gave other skaters hot chocolate for free. Then both parties were asked to rate how much the gesture was worth. The givers consistently undervalued how much the hot cocoa meant to the recipients.\n\nI’ve also noticed that people are inordinately grateful when you compliment them on something they’ve done well. A few years ago, a female colleague in a different department received a really big, prestigious research grant. So I wrote her a note congratulating her on the achievement. Later she told me that I was the ONLY person in the entire university who had written to her.\n\nThis Blog is also available as a daily email.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3635079-the-feds-are-coming-for-your-credit-card-rewards/",
        "description": "According to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, “over 175 million Americans hold at least one credit card,” making them “one of the most commonly-held and widely-used financial products” in the United States. Credit cards have become so dominant in America that card processors like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover process more than 108 million transactions daily.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe popularity of credit cards stems largely from the substantial benefits they offer American consumers — easy cash-free payments, cash back programs, and various miles and rewards. Despite these benefits, Congress is considering reforms that, if enacted, would prevent credit card companies from offering these types of rewards.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLawmakers in Washington must reject any effort that would see consumers lose access to these popular programs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn late July 2022, Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) introduced the Credit Card Competition Act (CCCA) with the support of Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.). If approved by Congress, the act would direct banks to offer the “choice of at least two networks over which an electronic credit transaction may be processed.” Durbin and Marshall reason that by requiring a choice in payment networks, merchants can lower the swipe fees they are forced to pay every time a consumer purchases something on a credit card.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a press release announcing the legislation, Durbin stated, “this legislation, which builds upon pro-competition reforms Congress enacted in 2010, would give small businesses a meaningful choice when it comes to card networks, and it would enable innovators to gain a foothold in credit cards. Bringing real competition to credit card networks will help reduce swipe fees and hold down costs for Main Street merchants and their customers.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConsumers only need to look to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to see the potential dangers of credit card reforms. As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress passed Durbin’s eponymous amendment that capped debit swipe fees and resulted in the decline of reward debit cards, which were no longer profitable for banks to operate. Shortly after the Dodd-Frank Act became law, JP Morgan Chase notified its customers that its debit reward program would end, followed closely by Wells Fargo and Sun Trust. In addition, banks also discontinued free checking accounts, hitting consumers directly in the pocket and pushing some lower-income consumers to be unbanked.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJust as debit card reforms harmed consumers, so too will credit card reforms. The biggest casualty of this new legislation will be co-branded credit cards, more commonly known as rewards credit cards. While first created by airlines, reward cards are now offered by hotel chains, cell phone companies, coffee chains, tech companies, and even grocery stores. To create a rewards card, a company will typically rely on a single network processor, an agreement that would be outlawed if the CCCA becomes law by allowing merchants to choose which network to process their payments. Such prohibitions will make it almost impossible for rewards cards to be offered to consumers, and it will mean higher annual fees for people who want to keep their credit cards.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe loss of reward credit cards will result in a significant decline in consumer welfare. According to the Electronic Payments Coalition (EPC), “87% of cardholders owned a rewards credit card,” and 96 percent of rewards cardholders consider their card-based rewards programs “very or somewhat valuable.” These statistics highlight the reality that altering how rewards cards operate would deny consumers access to a product with which they are overwhelmingly satisfied.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdditionally, eliminating rewards credit cards would also harm merchants, the very people the CCCA was intended to help. According to EPC, “relative to a non-rewards consumer credit card, a rewards card is associated with an average transaction size that is 25–60% higher.” For merchants, increased transaction sizes mean greater revenue and profitability that, in turn, can be reinvested into their businesses.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere is another serious drawback to this legislative proposal, because the proposal could divert traffic to lower-cost payment networks. However, these networks are low cost because they do not have the same cybersecurity protections that the major credit card networks have. This means that consumers, merchants, and banks are more likely to be exposed to security breaches and fraud.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConsidering that no elected official would intentionally want to make things worse for their constituents, we can only assume that Durbin and Marshall had good intentions when they introduced the CCCA. Unfortunately, good intentions do not always equal good policy.&nbsp;The CCCA will undoubtedly result in the federal government taking away popular credit card rewards programs from consumers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor the sake of consumers and merchants, Congress must put a stop to such hazardous proposals as the unintended consequences will hurt those it intends to protect.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSteve Pociask and Edward Longe wrote this for the American Consumer Institute.

        "description": "Congress is still easing back into the post-recess and Labor Day break, but Sen.&nbsp;Bernie Sanders&nbsp;(I-Vt.) isn't wasting any time in going after a key fall agenda item.\n\n\n\nSanders took to the Senate floor Thursday to rail against a deal between Majority Leader&nbsp;Charles Schumer&nbsp;(D-N.Y.) and Sen.&nbsp;Joe Manchin&nbsp;(D-W.Va.) to speed up approval for energy projects, including those based on fossil fuels.\n\n\n\nSchumer had made the deal to win Manchin's support for the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) — Democrats' health, climate and tax bill. The Democratic leader has argued that \"permitting reform is part of the IRA, and we will get it done.\"\n\n\n\nBut Sanders is vowing to oppose such a plan, which Schumer wants to attach to a stopgap funding bill known as a continuing resolution that Congress must pass by the end of this month to avert a shutdown.\n\n\n\n\"I will not vote for any bill that makes it easier for Big Oil to destroy the planet and that includes approving the Mountain Valley Pipeline,\" the Vermont senator said on Twitter. \"The Continuing Resolution must not be held hostage by Big Oil.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy attaching the deal to the government funding bill, it would force progressives to choose between backing the agreement — including its provisions expediting development of fossil fuel projects — or potentially risking a government shutdown.\n\n\n\nRep.&nbsp;Raúl Grijalva’s (D-Ariz.) office&nbsp;told The Hill&nbsp;this week that 50 lawmakers had signed onto a letter urging a separate vote on the permitting reform provisions, instead of putting them in the continuing resolution.\n\n\n\nYou can catch up on all the details of the Manchin-Schumer deal here.\n\n\n\nWelcome to NotedDC: Your guide to politics, policy &amp; people of consequence in D.C.

She met with countless world leaders including 13 sitting U.S. presidents. (Lyndon Johnson&nbsp;is the only exception while she was in office.)&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;White House Historical Association&nbsp;has&nbsp;a ton of details on her visits&nbsp;to the nation's capital on its website.\n\n\n\nTributes poured in for the queen from various U.S. leaders on Thursday:\n\n\n\nPresident Biden: In an official White House proclamation that will go on the record, Biden declared that \"Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was more than a monarch.

Her leadership and enduring diplomacy secured and advanced alliances with the United States and countries around the world.\"Former President Obama: \"Back when we were just beginning to navigate life as President and First Lady, she welcomed us to the world stage with open arms and extraordinary generosity ... Time and again, we were struck by her warmth, the way she put people at ease, and how she brought her considerable humor and charm to moments of great pomp and circumstance.\"House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.): “Today, Americans join in sending the condolences of our whole nation to His Majesty the King, to The Royal Family, and to the people of the United Kingdom, Canada, and the whole Commonwealth of Nations she led with steadfastness and grace for seven decades.”\n\n\n\n🚨 DOJ appealing special master decision\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed a notice signaling it plans to appeal a federal judge's ruling that granted former&nbsp;President Trump's request for an independent reviewer, known as a special master.\n\n\n\nThe DOJ on Thursday warned of \"irreparable harm from the undue delay to the criminal investigation\" unless a judge offered a partial stay to a ruling blocking investigators from accessing classified materials seized from Mar-a-Lago.“Any delay poses significant concerns in the context of an investigation into the mishandling of classified records,\" the DOJ stated,&nbsp;The Hill's Rebecca Beitsch reported.\n\n\n\nThe appeal itself will go to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes six Trump appointees on the bench, while the motion for a partial stay would allow the government to continue its review of the records removed from Trump's home.\n\n\n\nRelated: Trump special master ruling ‘troubling,’ legal experts say\n\n\n\n🎤  Fetterman, Oz to square off in debate\n\n\n\nPennsylvania’s tense fight for an open Senate seat looks like it will soon shift from Twitter digs to a prime-time gig.\n\n\n\nPennsylvania Lt.

        "description": "Mehmet Oz, the Republican Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, called on his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, to participate in a debate in September after Fetterman suggested a singular October debate.\n\n\n\n\"The first debate has to be in September so we can allow voters to know who their candidates are right now,\" Oz told Axios on Thursday. \"Pick one of the debates in the next two, three weeks. So we can get this ball rolling.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Oz’s campaign noted that the Republican candidate is open to an October debate but believes there should also be a debate in September. Oz told Axios that he wants to debate his opponent before early voting, which begins on Sept. 19 in Pennsylvania, gets well underway.\n\n\n\nFetterman on Wednesday&nbsp;vowed to face-off against Oz&nbsp;sometime in mid-to-late October but did not give further details about the potential debate. Fetterman, who was criticized for failing to commit to any debates, has cited lingering issues with auditory processing from&nbsp;a stroke&nbsp;in May.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRecent polls have shown Fetterman leading Oz in the race for Pennsylvania’s senate seat, inspiring hope among Democrats. While Fetterman led Oz by only 4 points in a recent Emerson College poll, a separate Franklin and Marshall College poll found the Democrat leading by 14 points.\n\n\n\n— Updated at 8:02 p.m.",

        "description": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning for doctors and patients on Thursday after it received reports of people with breast implants being diagnosed with multiple types of cancer. \n\n\n\nBinita Ashar, the director of the Office of Surgical and Infection Control Devices in the agency’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a release that the FDA received reports of squamous cell carcinoma and various lymphomas in the capsule or scar tissue near the implants. \n\n\n\nAshar said the FDA reviewed the reports and determined that such occurrences are rare, but the agency wanted to provide “clear and understandable information” to the public as soon as possible.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome of those who reported having cancer had symptoms of swelling, pain, lumps or skin changes, Ashar said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe said these reports are separate from breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma, which the FDA started warning about more than 10 years ago. \n\n\n\nAshar said the agency does not have enough information to conclude if the implants cause certain cancers or if some implants pose a higher risk than others. Any instances of squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma or any cancer near the scar tissue around breast implants should be reported to the FDA as a result. \n\n\n\n“Our collective understanding has advanced significantly because of the efforts to study, communicate and act when needed,” she said. “As the agency moves further into adopting modernized approaches to our regulatory responsibilities to promote faster science-based decision-making, accurate data is crucial.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAshar said the FDA will conduct a literature review and continue its partnership with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons to identify ways to collect more detailed information about these cases.",

        "description": "When Topps Had Balls\n    \n\n  Though brief in impact, still a notable White Sox figure While this mention of Ken Frailing’s death on August 25 will be relatively brief, he was still a notable figure in White Sox history. \nFrailing was part of just the second draft class in White Sox history, taken in the fifth round in 1966. While perhaps not an endorsement for the early draft success of the franchise, Frailing was just the third White Sox draft choice (behind Paul Edmondson, taken in 1965, and top Sox pick of 1966, Carlos May) to achieve a positive WAR for the club.\nFrailing had a brief but effective tenure with the White Sox, and major league career. While throwing as a starter and never having a particularly outstanding stretch of time on the farm, the lefty debuted as a September call-up in 1972, and got into action right away, getting one out at Yankee Stadium. Three days later, he earned his first career victory, in a win at Comiskey Park over the Twins, again just getting one out. He totaled three innings in four games in 1972, earning 0.1 WAR — not a bad rate at all!\nThe next year, still serving as more of a lefty specialist out of the pen, Frailing saw more time with the White Sox and again acquitted himself well, earning 0.6 WAR in a mere 10 games. In his very small sample size on the South Side, Frailing clocked a 2.11 ERA — or in context, a 191 ERA+!\nWhen not on the South Side in 1973, Frailing was tearing it up as a member of the Triple-A Iowa Oaks, and his 11-3 record and 2.86 ERA made him a minor but potentially potent piece of the package (along with Steve Stone, Steve Swisher) sent north in the catastrophic White Sox deal for Ron Santo. \nOn the north side, the Cubs changed his role, moving him into a starter/swingman/long relief spot, where he was less effective. Still, he finished his career in 1978 still holding on to a sub-4.00 ERA (3.96) and even better 3.65 WHIP. His 97 ERA+ for his career indicates an essentially average pitcher who could have seen more time in the majors, especially as his career concluded with two new teams coming into MLB. However, he was troubled by nagging shoulder pain and hung his cleats up after one final season back in the White Sox organization, where he pitched to a 3.11 ERA in Double-A.\nFrailing was a native of Wisconsin, and kept some perspective on his career by making a habit of visiting Chicago-area children’s hospitals. We send our condolences to his family and friends.",

        "description": "U.S. officials are considering broadening recommendations for who gets vaccinated against monkeypox, possibly to include many men with HIV or those recently diagnosed with other sexually transmitted diseases.Driving the discussion is a study released Thursday showing that a higher-than-expected share of monkeypox infections are in people with other sexually transmitted infections.Dr. John T. Brooks, chief medical officer for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x27;s monkeypox outbreak response, said the report represents a “call to action.”Brooks told The Associated Press on Thursday that he expected vaccine recommendations to expand and that &quot;the White House, together with CDC, are working on a plan for what that will look like.”Currently, the CDC recommends the vaccine to people who are a close contact of someone who has monkeypox; people who know a sexual partner was diagnosed in the past two weeks; and gay or bisexual men who had multiple sexual partners in the last two weeks in an area with known virus spread.Shots are also recommended for health care workers at high risk of exposure.The vast majority of monkeypox cases are in men who have sex with men who reported close contact with an infected person during sex. But the new CDC report suggested infections in people with HIV and other STDs may be a bigger issue then previously realized.The report looked at about 2,000 monkeypox cases from four states and four cities from mid-May to late July.It found 38% of those with monkeypox infections had been diagnosed with HIV, far higher than their share of the population among men who have sex with men.The study also found that 41% of monkeypox patients had been diagnosed with an STD in the preceding year. And about 10% of those patients had been diagnosed with three or more different STDs in the prior year.There were racial differences. More than 60% of Black Americans with monkeypox had HIV, compared with 41% of Hispanic people, 28% of whites and 22% of Asians.Jason Farley, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, said men of color who have sex with men should be at the front of the line for monkeypox vaccine doses. Within those racial and ethnic groups, the next priority should be anyone living with HIV or was recently diagnosed with a STD, he said.The study has several limitations, including that the data may not be nationally representative, the authors said.Brooks said the findings could lead to vaccines being recommended for people with recent STD infections, people with HIV, people taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medications to prevent HIV infection and, possibly, prostitutes.Discussions of expanding eligibility will have to take into account supply of the two-dose vaccine. And any substantial expansion of monkeypox vaccination recommendations may also be subject to review by CDC’s outside vaccine advisers, health officials say.Also on Thursday, the CDC sent a letter to state and local health departments that said federal funds for HIV and STD prevention can also now be used against monkeypox. Cases in the U.S. seem to be declining, officials say.",

        "description": "Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s death sets a succession apparatus in motion that has been dormant for decades. Here, a youngster leaves flowers outside Windsor Castle on Thursday.Chris Jackson/Getty ImagesUpdated September 8, 2022 at 3:22 PM ETQueen Elizabeth II is being mourned by her family, fans and admirers. In Britain, her death at age 96 has thrown a state apparatus into motion that has sat idle for 70 years — since Elizabeth&#x27;s father, King George VI, died in 1952.The British government dubbed the intricate protocol of handling Elizabeth&#x27;s death &quot;Operation London Bridge.&quot; It ranges from succession rules to the process of bringing the queen&#x27;s coffin from Balmoral Castle in Scotland to London.The London Bridge plans were leaked to Politico last fall. Some of the details may have changed since then — but using them as a guide, here&#x27;s a brief look at what the documents say will happen in the first 10 days after the end of the queen&#x27;s record-setting reign:Day ZeroThe royal household notifies the public of the queen&#x27;s death. Prince Charles immediately succeeds to the throne upon his mother&#x27;s death. He will be known as King Charles III. His wife, Camilla, becomes queen consort. The couple stay at Balmoral overnight.Flags fly at half-staff across the British government. Charles issues a brief statement, as does U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss.Numerous commemorations are planned from moments of silence to military gun salutes and remembrances in honor of Elizabeth.Day 1Charles returns to London. The Accession Council — a gathering traditionally held at St. James&#x27;s Palace — meets, usually within 24 hours of a monarch&#x27;s death. It formally declares Elizabeth&#x27;s death and the new king&#x27;s accession to the throne. Parliament frames a message of condolence and suspends its normal business until after Elizabeth&#x27;s funeral.Week 1Elizabeth&#x27;s body is brought from Scotland to Buckingham Palace in London. A ceremonial procession carries her coffin to Westminster. She lies in state at Westminster Hall for three days, during which the public can visit for 23 hours of each day.As final funeral preparations are being made in London, Charles travels to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, visiting leaders in the United Kingdom.Day 10A state funeral service is held at Westminster Abbey, triggering an observance of two minutes&#x27; silence in the U.K.After a final service in St. George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor Castle, the queen is buried on the castle grounds next to her husband,  Prince Philip, who died in April 2021.

        "description": "The American Medical Association (AMA)&nbsp;and three other health organizations warned on Thursday that patients’ health is at risk in the aftermath of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and called on state officials across the country to give “clear guidance” on the interpretation of their abortion laws.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe AMA, American Pharmacists Association, American Society of Health-System Pharmacists and National Community Pharmacists Association said in a release that health care providers face a “confusing” legal landscape on abortion policies following the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling, which struck down a federal protection for abortion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Physicians and pharmacists need clear guidance from state boards of medicine and pharmacy, agencies, and policymakers to support the prescribing and dispensing of medically necessary medications that may be affected by this new legal and regulatory paradigm,” the groups said.&nbsp;“Without such guidance, we are deeply concerned that our patients will lose access to care and suffer irreparable harm.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe organizations said many questions remain about how broadly state abortion restrictions will be interpreted and how they will affect providers’ abilities to serve patients.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore than a dozen states have taken steps to ban or severely restrict abortion after Roe was overturned. In many of these states, medical providers can face imprisonment for violating their laws.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe organizations said many state laws forbid providers from prescribing an “abortion-inducing drug” and other similar terms. But they said the laws are not clear if only medicines prescribed to cause abortions are banned or if a medication prescribed for another reason is banned if it could induce an abortion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe groups said their members and patients have reported that this uncertainty is disrupting care. They said patients who need these medicines for reasons unrelated to pregnancy are reporting new challenges in obtaining them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Without access to medications proven to be safe and effective, our patients’ health is at risk,” they said. “As physicians and pharmacists, we view patient wellbeing as paramount and are deeply troubled that continuity of care is being disrupted.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe organizations said state medical and pharmacy boards, agencies and policymakers should ensure patients retain continuity of care and that their members understand their legal and licensing obligations.",

        "description": "Voters still see inflation as the top midterm issue, but other issues are gaining steam. We’ll also look at the agricultural industry’s concerns over a potential rail strike, liberals’ push for marijuana reform and billions more in U.S. military aid.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut first, read about&nbsp;five signature moments&nbsp;from Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWelcome to On The Money, your nightly guide to everything affecting your bills, bank account and bottom line. For The Hill, we’re Sylvan Lane, Aris Folley and Karl Evers-Hillstrom. Subscribe here.\n\n\n\nFewer Americans listing inflation as top issue: survey\n\n\n\nFewer Americans said inflation is their top issue going into November’s midterm elections than in recent months, according to a new poll released on Thursday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThirty percent of respondents in the NPR-PBS Newshour-Marist poll listed inflation as their top issue in the upcoming elections, down from 37 percent in July.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe shift comes after inflation slowed in July and as gas prices dropped from their all-time high in June.Still, inflation remained the issue most frequently cited as being “top of mind,” ahead of abortion and health care, according to the poll.In a separate Gallup poll from this week, 56 percent of Americans said that inflation is causing moderate or severe financial hardship.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNew figures on the way:&nbsp;All eyes are on Tuesday’s Consumer Price Index report, which will show whether inflation continued to cool in August.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Julia Shapero has more on the NPR poll here. \n\n\n\nWALKOUT WORRIES\n\n\n\nAg groups urge Congress to prevent ‘devastating’ rail strike&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore than 30 leading agricultural groups on Thursday urged lawmakers to avert a rail strike that would halt the transport of food and potentially cripple the U.S. economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a letter to top lawmakers, agricultural groups warned that farmers rely on freight rail to transport their goods and that any kind of stoppage would likely lead to the loss of food supplies, driving up prices and exacerbating the risk of famine around the globe.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“A freight rail stoppage would drastically make inflation worse, especially for those who can least afford it,” they wrote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAround 115,000 rail workers could strike as soon as Sept. 16 if they cannot reach a contract agreement with railroads.That would disrupt a host of industries that rely on freight to ship their products, which include grain, fertilizer, steel, plastics and coal.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKarl has more here. \n\n\n\nHIGH CHANCE?\n\n\n\nPressure dials up for Biden to take on marijuana decriminalization&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats are beginning to pressure President Biden to take on marijuana reform as Congress struggles to find a path forward on decriminalization and as the party contemplates what’s possible before the midterms.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLiberals have been building momentum with just two months until the November elections with back-to-back wins on key pieces of Biden’s agenda, from student loans to health care and tax reform.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn the campaign trail, some Democratic candidates are becoming more vocal about the issue, seeking to reignite what they see is not only a moral imperative but a smart political move to maintain their majority.While the issue has come up periodically, Biden has been cautious about appearing too enthusiastic about it. He campaigned in 2020 in support of what many progressives are pushing for, including prohibiting anyone from going to jail for recreational use and allowing states to legalize it, but he’s been slow to sign any type of executive action that grants broad federal rules.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAris and Hanna Trudo break it down here. \n\n\n\nEVENT INVITE\n\n\n\nYou’re Invited: A New Housing Market: Affordability, Access &amp; Equity, Tuesday, Sept. 20 at 8 a.m. ET\n\n\n\nThe housing market, spurred by two years of red-hot demand and dwindling home supply, is finally cooling down. And while staggering mortgage rate hikes for homebuyers have dominated recent headlines, the rental market is seeing its own share of dramatic price increases and competition. What is the current landscape of American housing, and how are ballooning interest rates and rent costs impacting American families? Reps. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) and French Hill (R-Ark), National Low Income Housing Coalition’s Diane Yentel, Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale and Urban Institute’s Janneke Ratcliffe. RSVP today to attend in-person or get livestream link.\n\n\n\nUKRAINE AID\n\n\n\nUS to send $2B to Ukraine, 18 other countries at risk of Russia&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe United States intends to send another $2 billion in military support to Ukraine and 18 nearby countries at risk of Russian attack, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Thursday during a visit to Kyiv.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin also on Thursday announced another package of weapons to Ukraine worth up to $675 million, a pledge made as he met with allies working to keep Ukraine equipped “over the long haul” amid the Russian invasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe new aid would push the U.S. security assistance commitment to Ukraine past the $15 billion mark since August 2021, and more than $14.5 billion since the Russia invasion began.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Ellen Mitchell has the details here. \n\n\n\nGood to Know\n\n\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday&nbsp;blasted the side deal&nbsp;that Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) struck earlier this summer to pass a controversial proposal to make it easier to develop fossil fuel-based energy projects.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSchumer told reporters Wednesday that he plans to attach Manchin’s permitting reform bill to the stopgap spending measure that needs to pass by Sept. 30 to prevent a government shutdown.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere’s what else we have our eye on:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) asked to pull a committee vote on a bill aimed at giving news outlets the ability to negotiate collectively with tech platforms after she said an adopted amendment offered by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) impeded the bipartisan agreement senators reached ahead of the Thursday meeting.The Biden administration announced a new goal to make the use of geothermal energy — renewable energy that comes from heat that’s inside the earth — “widespread” as it seeks to transition away from fossil fuels.The Bank of England on Thursday clarified that paper money bearing Queen Elizabeth II’s image is still legal tender following her death. \n\n\n\nThat’s it for today.

        "description": "The Senate Judiciary Committee debated a proposal Thursday morning that aims to give news outlets the ability to collectively negotiate with tech platforms — but the vote on the bill was held after Democrats pushed back on an approved amendment. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe’ll also break down the White House announcement on core principles for reform aimed at enhancing competition and tech accountability. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is Hillicon Valley, detailing all you need to know about tech and cyber news from Capitol Hill to Silicon Valley. Send tips to The Hill’s Rebecca Klar and Ines Kagubare. Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKlobuchar: Agreement ‘blown up’ by amendment\n\n\n\nSen.&nbsp;Amy Klobuchar&nbsp;(D-Minn.) asked to pull a committee vote on a bill aimed at giving news outlets the ability to negotiate collectively with tech platforms after she said an adopted amendment offered by Sen.&nbsp;Ted Cruz&nbsp;(R-Texas) impeded the bipartisan agreement senators reached ahead of the Thursday meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee were slated to vote on a revised version of the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, but Klobuchar asked to hold it after Cruz’s amendment was adopted by a one-vote margin by the Republicans on the committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think the agreement that we had has been blown up,” Klobuchar said.  In a statement, she said she fully plans to move forward with the bill.  “This bill is about protecting local journalism by leveling the playing field and allowing local news outlets to band together to negotiate for fair compensation from tech platforms. I am committed to targeted, bipartisan legislation to achieve this goal,” she said in the statement.  \n\n\n\nThe amendment passed in a 11-10 vote. Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), who is isolating in India after testing positive for COVID-19, was not present and did not provide a proxy vote either way on the amendment — giving the GOP senators an upper hand.  \n\n\n\nThe underlying bill would grant newsrooms that employ fewer than 1,500 full-time employees — a cap essentially aimed at excluding the country’s three largest newspapers and national broadcasters — the ability to collectively negotiate with dominant tech platforms, like Google and Facebook, to be compensated for distributing their content.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about the markup.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pre-markup debate on the bill  \n\n\n\nThe debate around the&nbsp;proposal that aims to give news outlets the power to negotiate with tech giants to distribute their content was heating up ahead of the Thursday a Senate markup.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBipartisan sponsors of the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act in the House and Senate released a revised version of the bill in August, which kicked off&nbsp;campaigns&nbsp;from advocacy groups for and against the legislation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nChamber of Progress, Public Knowledge and 19 other advocacy groups sent a letter&nbsp;on Friday&nbsp;to top senators of the Judiciary Committee against the bill, arguing the revised version would force tech platforms to carry digital content “regardless of how extreme” it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the News Media Alliance, a trade association that represents newspapers across the U.S., dismissed the arguments made against the legislation and said it would help even the playing field after years of tech platforms decimating local news.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is expected opposition based on the&nbsp;organizations&nbsp;asserting these claims,” Danielle Coffey, executive vice president and general counsel for the News Media Alliance, told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE TECH AGENDA  \n\n\n\nThe White House released a set of core principles for reform aimed at enhancing competition and tech accountability Thursday after a round table session convening experts, including officials from advocacy groups, private companies and the government. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAttendees included Washington, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine (D), Sonos CEO Patrick Spence and President and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology Damon Hewitt.  \n\n\n\nThe White House identified six broad principles for reform, including promoting competition in the technology sector, providing “robust” federal protections for privacy, protecting kids’ safety online, increasing transparency about algorithms, and stopping discriminatory algorithmic decision-making. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe other core principle the White House identified was reforming “special legal protections for large tech platforms,” referring to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The controversial provision provides a liability shield for tech companies over content posted by third parties on their platforms. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the announcement, the White House said President Biden has “long called for fundamental reforms to Section 230.” On the presidential campaign trail, Biden said Section 230 should be revoked but the president has yet to expand on what that reform under his administration may look like. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBITS &amp; PIECES\n\n\n\nAn op-ed to chew on: No car loans from Bank Australia, unless it’s an EV — and the US may do the same&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNotable links from around the web:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen Teens Find Misinformation, These Teachers Are Ready (The New York Times / Tiffany Hsu) &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Facebook button is disappearing from websites as consumers demand better privacy (CNBC/ Jonathan Vanian) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎤 Lighter click: The next American Idol?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne more thing: DOJ appeals special master ruling \n\n\n\nThe Justice Department on Thursday filed a notice of intent to appeal a ruling granting former President Trump’s request for a special master, asking the judge stay a ruling blocking their investigation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Without a stay, the government and public also will suffer irreparable harm from the undue delay to the criminal investigation,” DOJ writes in its filing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Any delay poses significant concerns in the context of an investigation into the mishandling of classified records.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it for today, thanks for reading.

        "description": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) expressed his opposition to a Manchin-led permitting push that has the support of Democratic leaders. Meanwhile, the Interior Department removed a slur from federal place names, and the Energy Department is backing geothermal. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is Overnight Energy &amp; Environment, your source for the latest news focused on energy, the environment and beyond. For The Hill, we’re Rachel Frazin and Zack Budryk. Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanders: Manchin deal is a fossil ‘giveaway’\n\n\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday blasted the side deal that Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) struck earlier this summer to pass a controversial proposal to make it easier to develop fossil fuel-based energy projects.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSchumer told reporters Wednesday that he plans to attach Manchin’s permitting reform bill to the stopgap spending measure that needs to pass by Sept. 30 to prevent a government shutdown.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nSanders slammed the agreement as “a huge giveaway to the fossil fuel industry” and angrily warned that it would undermine President Biden’s pledge to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent by the year 2030. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I rise this morning to express by strong opposition to the so-called side deal that the fossil fuel industry is pushing to make it easier for them to pollute the environment and destroy our planet,” Sanders said.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe said the legislation crafted by Manchin would make it easier for the fossil fuel industry to receive permits and complete what he called “some of the dirtiest and most polluting oil and gas projects in America.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about Sanders’s speech here, from The Hill’s Alexander Bolton. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHITE HOUSE BACKS THE CHANGES \n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre expressed the White House’s support for the permitting reform agreement.  \n\n\n\n“We support the permitting reform bill, which will help us realize the benefits of the historic investments in the inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law as well. We want to see it enacted,” she told reporters during a press briefing.\n\n\n\n“We are working with Senator Schumer and Senator Manchin to find the best path forward. We think it's important to meet the country's clean energy goals and to reduce costs and to promote energy security. Permitting always delays new solar and new wind projects,” Jean-Pierre added. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterior removes slur from federal place names\n\n\n\nThe Interior Department announced Thursday that it has completed the removal of a slur for Native American women from federal place names after announcing a review in November. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the announcement, the department said the federal Board on Geographic Names has voted on replacement names for more than 600 places that included the slur. The department also issued a full map of places where names were replaced. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to hold the position, announced the review late last year as well as a federal committee to assess the use of slurs and pejoratives in federal place names.\n\n\n\n“I feel a deep obligation to use my platform to ensure that our public lands and waters are accessible and welcoming. That starts with removing racist and derogatory names that have graced federal locations for far too long,” Haaland said in a statement Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe review followed similar moves to replace anti-Black and anti-Japanese slurs in place names. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about the removal here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENERGY WANTS GEOTHERMAL POWER TO BE ‘WIDESPREAD’ \n\n\n\nThe Biden administration announced a new goal to make the use of geothermal energy — renewable energy that comes from heat that’s inside the earth — “widespread” as it seeks to transition away from fossil fuels. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Energy Department said it hopes to cut the costs of geothermal energy systems by 90 percent by 2035. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe department said that capturing even a “small fraction” of the U.S.’s geothermal resources could power more than 40 million homes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The United States has a vast, geothermal energy resource lying right beneath our feet, and this program will make it economical to bring that power to American households and businesses,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.  \n\n\n\nSpecifically, the Energy Department will invest in research and development for geothermal energy. Geothermal energy can be used to heat buildings, as well as in electricity generation, food dehydrating, gold mining and milk pasteurizing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about the push here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIRTUAL EVENT INVITE\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Infrastructure Summit,Wednesday,Sept. 14 at 1 p.m. ET\n\n\n\nImproved, sustainable infrastructure means cleaner water, safer roads, enhanced connectivity and a modern future.

        "description": "Two weeks ago, the Cy Young race in the American League looked like a two-horse race, with both Houston&#8217;s Justin Verlander and Tampa Bay&#8217;s Shane McClanahan hovering at or below the 2.00 ERA mark and racking up innings atop their teams&#8217; respective rotations. McClanahan has the larger strikeout percentage and subsequently superior marks from fielding-independent metrics that some voters increasingly weigh. Verlander was averaging one extra out recorded per start prior to being lifted early his last time out, and his 16-3 win-loss record might hold some sway with traditionalist voters.\nOr, all of that could be rendered moot.\nBoth Verlander and McClanahan are on the 15-day injured list, and Verlander, who had been improbably leading the Majors in ERA as a 39-year-old in his first season back from Tommy John surgery, sounds as though he&#8217;ll miss several weeks rather than just the 15-day minimum. McClanahan, a late scratch from his last start, is already throwing and seems likelier to make a quick return. However, the Rays could very well take a cautious approach and limit his innings after a two-week absence due to a shoulder impingement.\nAt the very least, the door is now open for further competition in Cy Young voting, ostensibly setting the stage for the closest AL vote we&#8217;ve seen since 2019, when Verlander and then-teammate Gerrit Cole finished in the top two positions on the ballot. Last year&#8217;s NL Cy Young voting sparked plenty of controversy and debate as well, and as things currently stand, we could get an encore of that scene in the AL this year.\nIf not Verlander or McClanahan, who are the top names to consider? Let&#8217;s dive in.\nDylan Cease, RHP, White Sox\nCease, following a near-no-hitter against the Twins that saw him go 8 2/3 before Luis Arraez cracked a ninth-inning single, may have leapfrogged both Verlander and McClanahan as the odds-on favorite in the American League. He&#8217;s sitting on MLB&#8217;s third-lowest ERA &#8212; sandwiched right between Verlander and McClanahan, no less &#8212; and that 2.13 mark is complemented by a 31.4% strikeout rate that ranks as the fourth-highest of any qualified starting pitcher in baseball.\nAt 5.5 wins above replacement (per Baseball Reference), Cease already leads American League pitchers &#8212; even over Verlander and McClanahan. That&#8217;d due largely to the fact that Cease is putting up these numbers in front of one of the game&#8217;s bottom-10 defenses.\nIt&#8217;s not all roses, as Cease has a 10.4% walk rate that sits dead last among qualified starters. He hasn&#8217;t been terribly efficient, either; where both Verlander and McClanahan have averaged comfortably more than six innings per start, Cease has averaged 5.77 innings per appearance this year.\nStill, Chicagoans can no doubt see the parallels between Cease&#8217;s 2022 showing and the 2016 performance of another Chicago hurler &#8212; crosstown righty Jake Arrieta, when he rode a historic summer surge to Cy Young honors. Over his past 15 starts, Cease has tallied 93 innings of 1.45 ERA ball and held opponents to one or zero runs on a dozen occasions. Cease isn&#8217;t quite in Arrieta territory (0.86 ERA in his final 147 innings), but he&#8217;s not terribly far off, either. If he can sustain anything close to this pace, Cease will finish the season at or near the top of the AL in terms of innings pitched, ERA, total strikeouts and strikeout rate.\nAlek Manoah, RHP, Blue Jays\nManoah looked borderline unhittable for the season&#8217;s first two months, carrying a 1.67 ERA in that time and allowing just 55 hits and a 0.59 HR/9 mark through June 13 (75 2/3 innings). He had a solid but closer-to-average run for much of the summer but has now yielded just three runs in his past 28 1/3 innings.\nAt 171 innings of 2.42 ERA ball on the year, the 24-year-old is on the periphery of the race at present. He ranks fourth in American League ERA but trails McClanahan, Cease and especially Verlander in that department. He lacks the gaudy strikeout ratios boasted by both Cease and McClanahan but limits hard contact better than any non-McClanahan pitcher in the AL, evidenced by a 31.3% hard-hit rate. (McClanahan leads qualified AL starters at 30.1%.)\nHowever, Manoah&#8217;s 171 are second-most in the American League, and if he continues this hot streak, there&#8217;s a chance he could wind up among the league leaders in ERA, innings pitched and other key categories. In terms of wins and losses, everyone&#8217;s trailing Verlander&#8217;s 16 victories, but Manoah&#8217;s 14 are tied with Framber Valdez for second in the league. Speaking of which&#8230;\nFramber Valdez, LHP, Astros\nIt&#8217;s easy to be overshadowed by the season Verlander is enjoying, but we should all probably be discussing Valdez&#8217;s outstanding year more than we are. The 28-year-old southpaw is just one-third of an inning behind Manoah at 170 2/3, and he also sits sixth in ERA (2.64) and ninth in bWAR (3.4).\nValdez has emerged as baseball&#8217;s preeminent ground-ball starting pitcher, and it&#8217;s not close; he leads all qualified pitchers in ground-ball rate at 66.7%, and Logan Webb&#8217;s 57.5% rate is second-best. Even dropping the minimum to 50 innings as a starter, he still leads Alex Cobb (61.9%) and Andre Pallante (61.4%) by a wide margin.\nIn an age where starters are yanked from the game earlier than ever before, Valdez is a throwback. He&#8217;s worked at least six innings in every one of his starts since April 25, completing seven or more innings on 11 occasions and twice going the distance with a complete game. Over his past five starts, Valdez has 35 2/3 innings of 1.77 ERA ball. It&#8217;ll be a challenge for him to drop his ERA into the low 2.00s, and he can&#8217;t match Cease or McClanahan in terms of strikeouts, but Valdez will likely be the American League innings leader and finish with a mid-2.00s ERA and MLB-leading ground-ball rate.\nShohei Ohtani, RHP, Angels\nWhen Ohtani pitched to a 3.99 ERA through the first six weeks of the season, it looked as if we were in for an (almost) mortal season out of the two-way phenom. He averaged just over five innings per start, and while the strikeouts were still there in droves, he was also unusually homer-prone. A Cy Young pursuit did not appear to be on the horizon.\nIn 88 2/3 innings since that time? Ohtani has a 1.83 ERA with fewer homers allowed (six) than in his first 47 1/3 innings (seven). He at one point rattled off six consecutive starts with double-digit strikeout totals, and opponents have batted .199/.249/.301 against him during this stretch.\nOhtani&#8217;s 33% strikeout rate on the season leads qualified starting pitchers (though would trail Braves phenom Spencer Strider by a good margin if Strider had a few more innings), and while many fans and Ohtani detractors bristle at the notion, it&#8217;s hard not to consider that he does all this while also serving as a middle-of-the-order slugger who ranks among the league&#8217;s top power threats.\nUltimately, with just 136 innings pitched this season, it&#8217;s hard to imagine that Ohtani will actually garner many (if any) first-place Cy Young votes. Yes, he&#8217;s sporting a 2.58 ERA, leading the league with a 33% strikeout rate and sitting second among AL starters with 4.7 bWAR. But Ohtani is ultimately going to be up against multiple starters with better bottom-line run prevention numbers and as many as 40 to 50 additional innings pitched. Corbin Burnes won an NL Cy Young last year with just 167 frames, but the top names in the American League this year have had better seasons.\nKevin Gausman, RHP, Blue Jays\nGausman will be the analytic darling in this year&#8217;s field. I debated whether to mention him at all for this breakdown, as he&#8217;d need a pretty dominant finish to push his way in among the leaders in more traditional categories, but the right-hander is second in the American League at FanGraphs with 5.2 wins above replacement. fWAR is based on fielding-independent pitching rather than actual runs allowed, and Gausman has been quite good this season &#8212; 3.12 ERA in 147 innings &#8212; despite being one of the game&#8217;s least-fortunate pitchers in terms of balls in play. He&#8217;s lugging around an MLB-worst .368 BABIP, and the next-highest mark (Jordan Lyles at .323) isn&#8217;t even close.\nThere&#8217;s perhaps some temptation to think that Gausman is then yielding far too much hard contact, but that&#8217;s not necessarily the case. He&#8217;s not managing contact as well as any of the others profiled here, but his 89 mph average exit velocity and 39% hard-hit rate are barely north of the respective 88.6 mph and 38.3% league averages in those regards.\nGausman has the game&#8217;s third-best walk rate (3.8%), the tenth-best strikeout rate (27.9%) and is sixth-best in the differential between those two (24.1 K-BB%). He&#8217;s averaging just 5 2/3 innings per start, however, and isn&#8217;t particularly helping his cause down the stretch (3.99 ERA over his past five outings&#8230; again, with a .370 BABIP).\n&#8212;\nA lot can (and will) change between now and season&#8217;s end, but since this is all just for debate anyhow, I&#8217;ll include a poll to close this out:\n[polldaddy poll=11194815]",

        "description": "Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images\n    \n\n  After going 7-1 against a stretch of inferior opponents, the Braves will face a tough Mariners team on the road this weekend. The 2022 Braves have made a ton of hay out of favorable matchups this year, and the present is no different: after two late-game meltdowns resulted in a series loss to the Cardinals, they’ve gone 7-1 against a spate of inferior opposition, pushing themselves closer and closer to the lead in the NL East. (No team has a better record against sub-.500 clubs than Atlanta’s 59-21.) However, they’ll face a tougher, and rarer test this weekend, as they head to Seattle for a three-game set against the Mariners.\nThis will be only the sixth-ever series between the two teams, and the Braves’ fourth-ever visit to the Pacific Northwest. The Braves are 7-9 against the Mariners overall, but 4-4 at Safeco Field/T-Mobile Park (this will be the first series the Braves play under the park’s new name). The Braves dropped a series to the Mariners at home in 2017, and were swept by them twice (home-and-home) across four games in 2014. They last won a series against them when sweeping them in Seattle in 2011.\nThis Mariners team (and this Braves team!) has little in common with that comparatively ancient history, though. After an insane bout of overperforming their talent level in 2021 (74 WAR-wins, 90 actual wins) and barely missing the playoffs, the Mariners are much better (albeit still overperforming their production by quite a lot) this time around. They have a top-10 position player unit (ninth in offense, seventh in defense), led by rookie phenom Julio Rodriguez (4.2 fWAR), a resurgent Eugenio Suarez (4.0 fWAR), and sophomore slugging catcher Cal Raleigh (3.5 fWAR in 353 PAs). It’s not the deepest team in the world, but they’re getting decent production from nearly everywhere (second base has been an issue).\nIt’s the pitching where the Mariners could use some improvement. The bullpen’s been pretty good, with breakout righties Erik Swanson and fireballing Andres Munoz providing a ton of relief value. The rotation’s been just okay — bolstered substantially by call-up George Kirby and trade acquisition Luis Castillo, but hampered by Chris Flexen being unable to repeat anything close to his 2021 and Marco Gonzales repeating his 2021 too well.\n\nFriday, September 9, 9:40 pm EDT\nCharlie Morton (26 GS, 146 IP, 96 ERA-, 101 FIP-, 88 xFIP-, 95ish xERA-)\nThough inconsistent from start to start, Morton’s been pretty solid for about half the season now, with an aggregate 78/93/72 line since the start of June. He remains homer-prone in bunches, as 14 of his 21 homers allowed on the year have been yielded in six total multi-homer games, but has only had four games with K/BB woes in three months. He held the Marlins to a solo homer with a 7/2 K/BB ratio in his most recent start.\nMorton has 10 career starts against the Mariners, but hasn’t faced them since 2019.\nRobbie Ray (27 GS, 161 2⁄3 IP, 94 ERA-, 101 FIP-, 87 xFIP-, 93ish xERA-)\nIt’s actually creepy-slash-impressive just how similar Morton and Ray have been this year on the top line, with nearly-identical park-adjusted stats. (Both are right at 2.5 fWAR/200, too, unsurprisingly.) Signed to a $115 million, five-year deal in the offseason, Ray has provided some overall stability but not too much else, as he’s gone substantially backwards in both the strikeout and walk departments from his 2021 career year in Toronto. Like Morton, he’s hard some start-to-start issues, sometimes with walks, sometimes with homers. He had a 24/4 K/BB ratio in three starts coming into his last outing, in which he did pitch six frames without a run charged, but only managed a 3/0 K/BB ratio. \nOne wonders if Ray would be much better this season if he simply stopped throwing a sinker he didn’t really use at all last year — it isn’t good in any sense, while his fastball and cutter/slider remain fantastic. He didn’t start throwing it until partway through this year and is de-emphasizing it after it didn’t do much for him, but it sticks out like a sore thumb in his otherwise-really nice pitching profile.\nThe Braves faced Ray twice last year and tagged him for a combined three homers despite him putting up a 15/1 K/BB ratio; they lost both games, including both a blowout and a late-inning meltdown.\n\nSaturday, September 10, 9:10 pm EDT\nMax Fried (26 GS, 163 1⁄3 IP, 59 ERA-, 64 FIP-, 76 xFIP-, 67ish xERA-)\nAfter rain washed away his most recent start of five hitless innings (6/1 K/BB), Max Fried will continue his attempt to trek up the fWAR leaderboard against the Mariners. Fried is currently third in the NL with 4.9, behind Aaron Nola’s 5.3 and Carlos Rodon’s 5.2; both Nola and Rodon have 27 starts to Fried’s 26. \nThe ace is once again on a great run overall. In his past eight starts, he hasn’t had an in-start ERA, FIP, or xFIP exceed 4.50, and the only thing exceeding 3.86 in those outings was one ERA mark in a game against the Phillies. Fried has had pretty much one unequivocably bad outing all year (the 5/5 K/BB ratio game against the Mets) and has ascended to one of the top pitchers in the game.\nGeorge Kirby (20 GS, 105 2⁄3 IP, 86 ERA-, 79 FIP-, 81 xFIP-, 86ish xERA-)\nSeattle’s first-round pick in the 2019 draft, George Kirby has been a huge boost to their rotation since coming up in May. After some struggles with the longball in June, he’s been close to flat-out dominant since: he has a 60/7 K/BB ratio over his last 10 starts, with a 60/35/70 line. \nKirby doesn’t walk anyone: he hasn’t had more than a single walk in a start this year. He hasn’t allowed a homer since the Orioles hit four off of him on June 27. He generally strikes out an above-average number of batters. Like Fried, he has just one game with an ERA, FIP, or xFIP exceeding 4.50 in his last 10 starts; in 11 of his 20 career starts so far he’s posted each of an ERA, FIP, and xFIP below 4.00. He somehow has an above-average strikeout rate despite a well-below-average whiff rate; in other words, he knows when to put guys away but isn’t going for whiff after whiff, instead living off the fact that batters can’t seem to square up his fastball early in the count.\nArsenal-wise, Kirby is somewhat of a unicorn, especially for a young call-up. He throws a hard four-seamer over half the time, but complements that with another five pitches, though primarily a curveball and cutter. The Braves’ best bet may be to sit on the curve or cutter and hope they get it, but the fastball is thrown so much that that’s a risky proposition. \n\nSunday, September 11, 4:10 pm EDT\nTBA but probably Jake Odorizzi?\nIt seems fairly likely that the Braves will give the ball to Odorizzi here, but they could use another option if needed. Odorizzi’s last start, on August 28, was a bizarre affair in which he threw 75 percent four-seamers and no-hit the Cardinals for 18 batters before unspooling as soon as the third time through the order came up. Odorizzi’s performance as a Brave is still below-replacement in total, but he’s been better since some kind of mechanical tweak was made during a rain delay in a game against the Mets three starts ago. \nMarco Gonzales (27 GS, 153 2⁄3 IP, 108 ERA-, 131 FIP-, 126 xFIP-, 127ish xERA-)\nGonzales has outperformed his FIP and xFIP consistently since the start of his second full season, and while 2022 is no different, he’s no longer on the hill while runs are prevented at an above-average rate for the first time in his career. Peripherals-wise, it’s been a struggle for the left-hander, as his strikeout rate has plunged to a very low 12.6 percent. \nGonzales allowed two homers with a 3/1 K/BB ratio to the White Sox in his last outing. The Braves should see this as a favorable matchup, unless somehow they get sequenced and BABIPed into offensive futility, which is always a possibility.",

The cutouts were only the start of\nthe story.\n\nLeaks from inside Cupertino are a lot harder to come by. And so we\nmissed the bigger picture, which is that Apple took the reduced\nsize of its sensor cutouts as an opportunity to redesign a big\nportion of the iOS interface. (Remember, it’s been five years\nsince the iPhone X introduced the stable peninsula that we call\nthe notch. That was the first cut at this sort of interface; the\ncompany’s had half a decade to think about its next move.)\n\n\nIt was pretty fun that so much hadn’t leaked about yesterday’s news, and the Dynamic Island is at the top of that list.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

Likewise, the Apple Watch Series 8 also got a few upgrades, but is still selling for the same price as the Series 7. As CNBC points out, though, those devices have gotten price bumps in several other countries, including the UK, Australia, Japan, Ireland, and Germany.\nIn some cases, getting Apple’s latest devices will cost significantly more now than last year. In the UK, for example, the iPhone 14 now costs £849, whereas the 13 started at £779. The Apple Watch is less of a jump but is still more expensive, with the Series 8 starting at £419, up from...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

The event Thursday evening marked 60 days until the midterms.\n\n\n\n“If they had it their way, they’d come after contraception, marriage equality, the whole right to privacy,” the president said.\n\n\n\nHe also took digs at Republicans for their stances on other issues like the high cost of insulin, the climate and the federal budget deficit.\n\n\n\n“Guess what, you know Republicans talk about being fiscally responsible, we are reducing the deficit,\" Biden said. \"Last year I reduced the deficit $350 billion.\"\n\n\n\nThe president made a plea to the hundreds of attendees at the reception to work to vote Republicans out in 2022.\n\n\n\n“You think they would have cared about inflation, reducing it, they would have voted for the Inflation Reduction Act but every single Republican, House and Senate, every single one, every Republican in the House, every Republican in the Senate, they voted against it,” he said.\n\n\n\n“Now every single American needs to return the favor and vote them out of office,” Biden added.\n\n\n\nHe reiterated his recent rhetoric about so-called MAGA Republicans, calling them extremists.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe said that “extreme MAGA Republicans” “embrace political violence\" and added, \"You can’t be pro-insurrection and pro-democracy.”\n\n\n\nHe also criticized former President Trump for saying he would pardon the Jan. 6 rioters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I want to be very clear up front, not every Republican is a MAGA Republican,\" Biden added. \"The mainstream Republicans, there’s still a few of them left.”",

        "description": "A U.S. firm announced on Thursday that it worked alongside law enforcement to recover more than $30 million worth of cryptocurrency that North Korean hackers stole earlier this year.\n\n\n\nChainalysis said the seized funds represent about 10 percent of the current value of the stolen cryptocurrency, which totaled about $620 million at the time it was stolen in March.\n\n\n\n“This marks the first time ever that cryptocurrency stolen by a North Korean hacking group has been seized, and we’re confident it won’t be the last,” the firm said in a statement.\n\n\n\nLazarus Group, a cybercrime organization associated with the North Korean government, stole the funds from players of the virtual pay-to-play game Axie Infinity. In the game, players use blockchain technology to purchase digital monsters, which are nonfungible tokens (NFT), and battle them against others.\n\n\n\nThe total stolen funds comprised 173,600 ethereum and 25.5M USDC, a cryptocurrency linked to the U.S. dollar.\n\n\n\nChainalysis called the theft “highly sophisticated,” noting that the hackers leveraged more than 12,000 different crypto addresses to date to launder the funds. The hackers initially retrieved the funds by breaking into the Ronin Network, which essentially transfers cryptocurrency in and out of the game.\n\n\n\nThe Treasury Department has taken aim at cryptocurrency thefts by imposing sanctions last month against cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash. The group aided North Korean hacking groups and others to launder stolen funds, according to the department.\n\n\n\nThe department also sanctioned Lazarus Group after the FBI confirmed the hack in the spring. The group is also known by other names, like “APT-C-26,” “Appleworm,” “Red Dot” and “Hidden Cobra.”\n\n\n\n“We have proven that with the right blockchain analysis tools, world-class investigators and compliance professionals can collaborate to stop even the most sophisticated hackers and launderers,” Chainalysis said in its statement. “There is still work to be done, but this is a milestone in our efforts to make the cryptocurrency ecosystem safer.”\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the FBI and Justice Department for comment.\n\n\n\nFederal investigators have on multiple occasions seized stolen cryptocurrency as the technology becomes more prominent.The Secret Service reportedly seized more than $100 million in cryptocurrency between 2015 and April of this year to combat fraudulent activity.Federal agencies earlier that month issued a joint advisory that warned about the rising threats involving cryptocurrency.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/mlb-players-association-joins-afl-cio.html",
        "description": "The MLB Players Association recently joined the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), reports Evan Drellich of the Athletic. The AFL-CIO is a federation of various unions in different industries throughout the country.\nMLBPA executive director Tony Clark pointed to the contentious return to play negotiations in the aftermath of the COVID-19 shutdown and last winter&#8217;s lockout as reasons for joining a broader labor federation. &#8220;The truth is we reflected on where our organization was, and the things that we potentially could do moving forward as a part of the broader labor discussion, and that’s why we’re here today,&#8221; Clark said upon announcing the decision yesterday.\nThe decision comes at a time when the MLBPA is attempting to vastly expand its membership. The union recently began efforts to incorporate minor leaguers. Just this week, the MLBPA announced that a majority of minor leaguers signed authorization cards that&#8217;d demonstrate interest on their part in joining the Players Association. The MLBPA petitioned Major League Baseball to recognize its authority to represent minor leaguers on that basis. If MLB declines to do so, the MLBPA could file a motion with the National Labor Relations Board for an election among minor leaguers. If more than half of those who cast votes do so in favor of unionization, the NLRB would require MLB to recognize the PA&#8217;s authority to represent minor leaguers.\n&#8220;We have engaged the league formally and informally,&#8221; Clark said yesterday of the request for voluntary recognition. &#8220;We remain hopeful that that conversation and decision will bear fruit. In the event that it doesn’t, we have the opportunity to petition the NLRB and go that route. So I truly think that there is an opportunity for us as an industry to have a conversation here, and a level of engagement that is beneficial for all involved. And we’ll just have to see how that plays out, but we’re encouraged, at least initially, with some of the dialogue that we’ve had. But we’ll have to see.&#8221;\nIt&#8217;s tough to know at this point whether the PA&#8217;s decision to join the AFL-CIO will have major repercussions on its handling of future discussions with the league. At the very least, it seems to allow Clark, lead negotiator Bruce Meyer and other MLBPA members freer communication with union leaders in other arenas. Labor attorney Eugene Freedman provides a breakdown (Twitter thread) of various benefits in areas like mortgages and car purchases that rank-and-file MLBPA members could now receive as part of AFL-CIO programs. Those aren&#8217;t likely to move the needle for major leaguers at the top of the salary scale, but they could be more meaningful for lower-salaried minor leaguers if they&#8217;re formally included in the MLBPA over the coming months.",

The cutouts were only the start of\nthe story.\n\nLeaks from inside Cupertino are a lot harder to come by. And so we\nmissed the bigger picture, which is that Apple took the reduced\nsize of its sensor cutouts as an opportunity to redesign a big\nportion of the iOS interface.

That was the first cut at this sort of interface; the\ncompany’s had half a decade to think about its next move.)\n\n\nIt was pretty fun that so much hadn’t leaked about yesterday’s news, and the Dynamic Island is at the top of that list.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Getty Images)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency analytics firm Chainalysis said on Thursday that it helped the US government seize $30 million worth of digital coins that North Korean-backed hackers stole earlier this year from the developer of the non-fungible token-based game Axie Infinite.\nWhen accounting for the more than 50 percent fall in cryptocurrency prices since the theft occurred in March, the seizure represents only about 12 percent of the total funds stolen. The people who pulled off the heist transferred 173,600 ethereum worth about $594 million at the time and $25.5 million in USDC stablecoin, making it one of the biggest cryptocurrency thefts ever.\nHarder to hide\nThe seizures \"demonstrate that it is becoming more difficult for bad actors to successfully cash out their ill-gotten crypto gains,” Erin Plante, senior director of investigations at Chainalysis, wrote. “We have proven that with the right blockchain analysis tools, world-class investigators and compliance professionals can collaborate to stop even the most sophisticated hackers and launderers.”Read 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/leak-all-but-confirms-a-new-hd-chromecast-is-on-the-way/",
        "description": "So, it&#8217;s official. Google will be hosting the company&#8217;s annual hardware event in Brooklyn next month and yes, we&#8217;re actually going to be there live and in person. (Exciting, right?) Anyway, we&#8217;ll be heading to New York to hopefully get our hands on the upcoming Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro, and the highly-anticipated Pixel Watch. \n\n\n\nWhile Google did make mention of new smart home tech from Nest which will likely include the all-but-confirmed Nest Wi-Fi, rumors are swirling about a new device coming to the Chromecast family. Unearthed all the way back in January of this year, news and leaks continue to pile up that Google is going to launch a new Chromecast with Google TV but this particular model is reported to only support HD(1080P) playback. The new Chromecast is rumored to be a budget-friendly version of Google&#8217;s popular streaming stick but the fact that you can pick up the 4K Chromecast for $40 at the moment only adds confusion as to why this new Chromecast even exists. I have to echo the sentiment of Android Police&#8217;s founder Artem Russakovskii who simply tweeted &#8220;1080P in 2022&#8221; with a head slap emoji. \n\n\n\n\n1080p in 2022 &#x1F926;&#x1F3FB;&#x200D;&#x2642;&#xFE0F; https://t.co/2rK5L1H2Wo&mdash; Artem Russakovskii &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1E6; (@ArtemR) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\nThis week, a new report has surfaced from WinFuture that states the new HD Chromecast has already arrived at a trusted retail source. No listings are live at the moment but if this report is true, it is very likely that the rumored Chromecast will be announced at Google&#8217;s upcoming hardware event. Now, the only question about this confusing device is &#8220;why?&#8221; Rumor has it that the new Chromecast HD will be priced around &#x20AC;40 or roughly $30 US. Again, why would you buy this instead of the 4K version that&#8217;s only a few more bucks?  \n\n\n\nI have a couple of theories. Neither one of these theories is backed by any evidence nor do I have any insider information. It&#8217;s simply that an HD Chromecast with Google TV for thirty dollars makes zero sense unless there are some puzzle pieces that we haven&#8217;t seen. Again, this is purely speculation and perhaps, a little bit of wishful thinking. So, here are my thoughts on what could make this new Chromecast actually make sense. \n\n\n\nMore space\n\n\n\nThe last HD Chromecast model was pre-Google TV and it doesn&#8217;t include the snazzy interface that you get with newer Android TV dongles and Google&#8217;s own Chromecast. That said, it still seems odd that Google would update the basic HD Chromecast simply to add a remote and Google TV. Remember, the 4K model is quite inexpensive and you can pick up Android TV devices like the onn TV from Walmart for $20 and yes, it is 4K.  \n\n\n\nHowever, Google has admitted that the current 4K Chromecast with Google TV is lacking in the hardware department. More specifically, the streaming dongle is a bit underpowered to handle the full-fledged app experience and interactive Google TV interface. The more glaring shortcoming of the latest Chromecast from Google is the puny amount of storage. Many who have used a Chromecast of Android TV dongles are painfully aware of the limited 8GB of storage that often prompts you to free up space in order to install a new application. \n\n\n\nSo, theory number one. Perhaps Google will deliver us an inexpensive Chromecast that&#8217;s Google TV ready with a remote and an ample amount of storage. If I could purchase a new streamer that offered up 32GB of storage or more, I would seriously consider buying it over the 4K model with way less drive space. I know that 4K content is becoming more and more common but let&#8217;s be honest, does the average consumer really care? I&#8217;m not sure but I&#8217;d wager that many, if not the majority, are watching mostly 1080P on a normal day. Again, this is just conjecture and may be completely wrong. Still, it would make this device more desirable for the masses. On to theory number two. \n\n\n\nAnother Chromecast 4K\n\n\n\nI know what you&#8217;re thinking. &#8220;There&#8217;s no way Google is going to announce a new 4K Chromecast. They can&#8217;t. There has been no sign or leaks about a second device.&#8221; That was exactly what we thought as we discussed the new Chromecast HD but then, something hit me. When a new phone, speaker, or streaming device goes into development, there are usually signs to be found. You have open source repositories that  contain codenames. There are Bluetooth certifications that are filed and of course, there has to be FCC filings before a product can be sold to the public. \n\n\n\nI know that none of this supports my theory but hear me out. If Google wanted to put out a new 4K Chromecast, they wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have to develop an entirely new device. The chipset in the current Chromecast isn&#8217;t horrible and a little bump in RAM would likely make it run smoothly enough to notice the improvement. Given that fact, it wouldn&#8217;t be out of the ordinary for Google to refresh the 4K Chromecast with some minor but much-needed upgrades while not having to actually submitting new hardware to public repositories. \n\n\n\nAs far as the FCC is concerned, updates of this kind are relatively simple and the fact that the current Chromecast is already FCC certified means that an updated model would only require and an addendum to the current certification. These types of updates happen all the time in the tech world and they often don&#8217;t get submitted to the FCC until weeks if not days before the device is officially announced. Imagine, if you will, a new 4K Chromecast with Google TV that&#8217;s packing a little more RAM, way more storage and maybe even a revamped remote. Price it somewhere in the $60-$70 range and the lesser HD model suddenly begins to make more sense. \n\n\n\nAnyway, that&#8217;s my two cents. I honestly have no idea what to expect at Google&#8217;s hardware event but this new Chromecast has me completely bewildered. The good news is that we won&#8217;t have to wait for much longer to see what&#8217;s new from the folks in Mountain View. We&#8217;ll be right there in the thick of things in Brooklyn and we&#8217;ll be bringing you hands on with all the new Made by Google toys that come from this event. Stay tuned. \n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "This show first aired on May 31, 2018.\nThe Studs Terkel edge on the radio was, first of all, picking guests who would sound more interesting 50, 60 years later: Mahalia Jackson, Bucky Fuller, Toni Morrison, Bertrand Russell. Simone de Beauvoir on her Second Sex. Federico Fellini on La Dolce Vita. David Mamet on his Glengarry, Glen Ross. Aaron Copland, Dizzy Gillespie. James Baldwin from 1961, Woody Allen in his twenties. Janis Joplin, Tennessee Williams. John Cage.  The other great mark of Studs Terkel radio was that these weren’t interviews – except when Marlon Brando wanted a second hour to interview Studs. They were conversations – emphasis not on facts or even opinions but rather “feeling tone,” emotion and experience.\nRadio legend Studs Terkel was the all-American listener: ears tuned, mind open, tape recorder always on.  The trick, he said, was something he’d heard – appropriately enough – from one of the uncelebrated citizens he loved interviewing.\n\nIllustrations by Susan Coyne\nThat “feeling tone” is the thread of this radio hour as much as the late Studs himself.  He was the voice of Chicago between Carl Sandburg a century ago – “hog butcher to the world,” and all that – and Chance the Rapper today.  Studs Terkel compiled a best-selling vernacular oral history of city life &#8212; Division Street America &#8212; then classic social histories of the Depression and World War 2.  Home base for more than 50 years was his daily radio hour on a privately owned fine-arts station in Chicago, WFMT.  The news of Studs Terkel that we’re happy to share is that 5000 hours of that radio archive are open anew, being digitized and transcribed – an audio event on a par with the opening of King Tut’s tomb.\n\nTony Macaluso manages the Studs collection at WFMT. He led us into the archives this week and guided us through some of his favorite interview with folks like Muhammad Ali,  Mahalia Jackson, Bertrand Russel, and Jimmy Baldwin.\nAlan Wieder wrote an oral history of how Studs got to be Studs. He helped us understand the roots of Terkel&#8217;s &#8220;soft socialist&#8221; politics through his growing-up years in the Wells-Grand Hotel as well as his early television career in Chicago.\nRick Kogan is a newspaper guy and radio voice in Chicago today.  He grew up modeling himself after his father—the great Chicago journalist Herman Kogan—and his father&#8217;s great pal, Uncle Studs:\nSydney Lewis was one of Studs Terkel’s closest collaborators in radio and literary production to the very end. She now works down the road from us at public station WCAI in Falmouth, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. With us, she discusses the joys of working with the man who wrote Working.\nJay Allison produces the NPR story-telling hour known as The Moth, which draws on a certain Studs enthusiasm… and extends it into deep into the digital cosmos: all those individual voices empowered in the podcasting era. He guides us through one of the lesser known parts of Terkel&#8217;s audio legacy: the incredible, freeform audio documentary Born to Live—which won the Prix Italia in 1962 and which was given a second-life online thanks to Allison and the team at transom.org.",

        "description": "Hey bud, be careful with that. | Image: Apple\n    \n\n  On Wednesday, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Ultra, a $799 wearable meant for people partaking in extreme activities like climbing mountains, running ultra-marathons, or diving. But as MacRumors points out, breaking its screen, button, sensors, or other various parts while doing any of these activities could be very expensive: repairs for the watch will cost $499 if you don’t have AppleCare Plus (we’ll get to that in a minute), according to an estimate tool on Apple’s website. That’s significantly more than the $299 repair for an entry-level Series 8.\nGetting the battery replaced on an Ultra will also cost more than it would for Apple’s less extreme watches, coming in at $99 instead of $79. That does make some sense; the Ultra likely...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

The PM said she had been reading about the queen’s ill health before going to bed, so 'when that torchlight came into my room I knew immediately what it meant'.

        "description": "Dylan Cease will take the mound tonight for the first time since his (almost) historic night. | Chase Agnello-Dean/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Dylan Cease takes the mound in important series in Oakland Hi, it’s me again. Tonight the Chicago White Sox have another late-night, West Coast matchup, this time against the Oakland Athletics. This is an important four-game set, as are the rest of the games from this point on. Taking three or four games from this series is ideal, and that starts that with a win tonight. \nTony La Russa is also looking to be back with the team as early as next week, but there is nothing confirmed as of now.\nFor another AL Central update, the Minnesota Twins lost both games of their doubleheader against New York last night, and tied 2-2 with the Yankees in the sixth inning. As of right now, the Twins and White Sox are tied for second place in the division. The Cleveland Guardians lost against the Kansas City Royals yesterday, but are off tonight before visiting Minnesota for a weekend series. \nWho better to have on the mound to close the gap in the division than Dylan Cease? \nIf only by virtue of staying healthy, Cease may now have moved into favorite status for the  Cy Young, holding a 13-6 record with a 2.13 ERA and 1.08 WHIP. In his last outing against the Twins ... well, we know how that went. Just a remarkable performance, although the no-hitter was broken up with two outs in the ninth inning. The game before that, against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Cease only allowed two hits. So if everything goes as planned, tonight he will allow no hits! In all seriousness, It’s amazing to watch him grow each and every game, and hopefully he can continue his dominance through the end of this season. \nThe South Siders will face lefty JP Sears, who has a 5-1 record, 2.37 ERA, and 1.11 WHIP.  He made his MLB debut this season with the Yankees in July, before being dealt over to Oakland as part of the Frankie Montas trade. Sears reported to Triple-A, but was recalled by the A’s in August. He has had solid outings the last few times out, and went six innings with six hits, two runs, and five strikeouts last week against the Baltimore Orioles. Sears uses three pitches, with his fastball being the go-to, at 61.3%. He follows with a slider (23.1%), and changeup (15.6%). In other words, if the White Sox can get a hold of Sears’ fastball, we should expect some solid contact at the plate tonight. \n\n\nTonight's #WhiteSox starters in Oakland.⏰: 8:40 p.m. CT : @NBCSChicago : @ESPN1000  : @FDSportsbook  : CWS to have most hits -300 pic.twitter.com/sucjLuO89A— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\nElvis Andrus will continue to lead it off, followed by Yoán Moncada and José Abreu. Red-hot Eloy Jiménez will serve as the DH, followed by AJ Pollock and Andrew Vaughn in the outfield corners. Romy González gets the start at second, Seby Zavala is behind the plate, and Adam Engel is in center. \n\n\nHappy Searsday #DrumTogether⚾: 6:40pm PT vs. White Sox : NBCSCA : Bloomberg 960 AM, KIQI 1010 AM : https://t.co/M834H8sLrm : https://t.co/sssl73aCEn Starting pitcher: Sears pic.twitter.com/hnCBvKRRhJ— Oakland A's (@Athletics) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\nGame time is at 8:40 p.m. CT.

        "description": "The National Football League (NFL) honored Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, who died on Thursday, with a moment of silence before its 2022-2023 season kickoff game.\n\n\n\nThe moment was held in memory of the 96-year-old monarch, \"whose message of unity and peace inspired people throughout the world for generations,\" the game announcer said.\n\n\n\nThe moment occurred prior to the start of the season opener between the Buffalo Bills and the Los Angeles Rams at SoFi Stadium in the California city.\n\n\n\nQueen Elizabeth, Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, died at Balmoral Castle, her summer residence in Scotland. A funeral for the late queen will be held in 10 days.\n\n\n\nKing Charles III, the son of Queen Elizabeth and former prince of Wales, immediately ascended to king on Thursday. His wife,&nbsp;Camilla, will now be known as the Queen Consort.\n\n\n\nCharles called the queen's passing “a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family,” in a statement.\n\n\n\nHe added, “I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.”",

        "link": "https://www.denverpost.com/2022/09/08/german-marquez-rockies-up-and-down-season/",
        "description": "German Marquez positively, firmly and absolutely believes that his best days are ahead.\nNow the right-hander has to prove it, beginning Friday night when the Rockies host Arizona at Coors Field, where Marquez is 2-5 with a 6.09 ERA, 1.532 WHIP, and .308 batting average against this season.\n&#8220;My best is still coming,&#8221; Marquez said. &#8220;There is an All-Star in there and there&#8217;s more in the tank. I just need to be more consistent.&#8221;\nAfter his last start at Coors Field, on Aug. 23 against Texas, Marquez used the phrase &#8220;frickin&#8217; frustrated&#8221; to describe his outing &#8212; a six-inning performance in which he gave up six runs on eight hits, including two home runs. For the quietly intense but usually restrained right-hander, it was a powerful admission.\nBut in Marquez&#8217;s last two starts &#8212; a scoreless, seven-inning, one-hit gem in New York against the Mets, and a two-run, three-hit, seven-inning performance at Cincinnati — Marquez looked a lot like the All-Star he was last season.\n&#8220;He&#8217;s definitely been better,&#8221; pitching coach Darryl Scott said. &#8220;He&#8217;s commanding his fastball better. He&#8217;s keeping the ball down in the zone and then coming up in the zone when he wants to come up.\n&#8220;Early on, he was moving too quickly down the slope (of the mound) and he was leaving pitches up. When he moves fast, his arm kind of gets behind him, and that&#8217;s when he leaves stuff up and can get hurt.&#8221;\nScott, who&#8217;s been working overtime to get Marquez right, is confident that the right-hander will evolve into the pitcher he can be.\n&#8220;The thing about &#8216;Marky&#8217; is that he uses setbacks as motivation,&#8221; Scott said. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t pout. He&#8217;s always working to get better and he will.&#8221;\nBut there&#8217;s no getting around the fact that 2022 has been no joy ride for Marquez, as his 8-10 record, 4.86 ERA, 1.360 WHIP and .262 batting average against illustrate.\nBut Marquez is still only 27 and still averages 95.8 mph on his four-seam fastball and 95.1 on his sinker. And he&#8217;s learned a few things by going through a season of literal hard knocks.\n&#8220;I think a lot of it is about focus,&#8221; Marquez said. &#8220;When I was struggling, I was losing my focus. But I have thrown all of that out of my mind and I&#8217;m concentrating on positive things now.\n&#8220;I do think the experiences this year are going to help me the next year and for the rest of my career.&#8221;\nManager Bud Black loves hearing that.\n&#8220;He&#8217;s got a lot of pride and he knows his place on this team,&#8221; Black said. &#8220;German knows the responsibility of the starting pitcher every fifth day and the importance of that to the outcome of the game he&#8217;s starting. He takes pride in being the guy who can carry the team on his shoulders that night.&#8221;\nBut it&#8217;s not just about mind games. There are some mechanical things going on, too. Marquez has been better about repeating his delivery, arm slot and release point.\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tKiszla: Why Bud Black wants to return as Rockies manager in 2023: &#8220;To be part of the solution to help us win.&#8221;\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Michael Toglia, Kyle Freeland help knock off Brewers, 8-4\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tDramatic rally leads Rockies over Brewers in 10 innings\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tJose Iglesias&#8217; solid season with Rockies interrupted by trip to IL\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tKeeler: Todd Helton&#8217;s second coming?

The first time we used the new grip we saw about 3 inches more dive to the ball.&#8221;\nOver his first 20 starts &#8212; from the beginning of the season to the end of July — Marquez had a 5.29 ERA and .274 batting average against. Over his last six, the right-hander has a 3.55 ERA and a .223 average against.\n&#8220;He&#8217;s had some really good games and a couple of rough ones,&#8221; Scott said. &#8220;After the &#8216;frickin&#8217; frustrated&#8217; game, he was like, &#8216;All right, that&#8217;s enough.&#8217; Sometimes you need those setbacks. He&#8217;s a guy who&#8217;s motivated by a tough outing.&#8221;\n\nOn Deck\nDiamondbacks RHP Zach Davies (2-4, 3.74 ERA) at Rockies RHP German Marquez (8-10, 4.86)\n6:40 p.m., Friday, Coors Field\nTV: AT&amp;T SportsNet\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM\nMarquez has been on a tear since two rocky starts in mid-August. In his last two outings, he&#8217;s tossed 14 innings, conceded four hits and only two earned runs. Both yielded Rockies wins, including one at Citi Field against the Mets. What’s more, the Rockies have won four of his last five starts. But Marquez has been a different pitcher at Coors Field than on the road. At thin air, his ERA has popped to 6.09 compared to his 3.58 clip on the road. Davies has been on a tear of his own, with Arizona winning five of his last six starts. Amazingly, he’s caught a no-decision for all of them. In his last four starts, Davies hasn’t allowed more than two earned runs in a game, and in his last two, his 10:3 strikeout-to-walk ratio has led to consecutive wins.\nTrending: Three Rockies are ranked in the top five in the majors in terms of average home run distance. Ryan McMahon ranks second (427 feet), C.J. Cron ranks fourth (422) and Brendan Rodgers ranks fifth (419).\nAt issue: The Rockies have struggled to get out of the gate this season, getting outscored 99-66 in the first inning.\nProbables:\nSaturday: Diamondbacks LHP Madison Bumgarner (6-13, 4.83) at Rockies RHP Jose Urena (3-6, 6.13), 6:10 p.m., ATTRM\nSunday: Diamondbacks RHP Zac Gallen (11-2, 2.42) at Rockies RHP Ryan Feltner (2-7, 5.85), 1:10 p.m., ATTRM\nMonday: Off day",

Polly Toynbee looks back on her lifeWhen Princess Elizabeth was born in 1926, the eldest daughter of the Duke of York, who would later become King George VI, she could have had little expectation of ever becoming queen. But the abdication crisis followed by the death of her father meant the 25-year-old Elizabeth assumed the throne.Earlier this year she celebrated her platinum jubilee, marking a reign of 70 years. The Guardian’s Polly Toynbee tells Nosheen Iqbal that the Queen’s reign has been one of momentous change – from the age of television to the dawn of the internet, and from an age of deference to one in which every royal scandal is minutely reported. Most of the UK’s population have never known another monarch. Continue reading...",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/rays-likely-to-activate-wander-franco-from-injured-list.html",
        "description": "The Rays are likely to activate Wander Franco from the 10-day injured list before tomorrow&#8217;s series opener with the Yankees, reports Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times. The shortstop has been on a minor league rehab assignment with Triple-A Durham, but he traveled with the team to the Bronx during today&#8217;s off day and is likely to be back in the lineup on Friday night.\nFranco has been out for two months. He suffered a hamate fracture in his right wrist on July 9, and he underwent surgery a few days later. That procedure came with a five-to-eight week recovery timetable. Franco comes in toward the latter end of that timeline, largely thanks to a couple brief setbacks along the way. Sent out on a rehab assignment in mid-August, the 21-year-old was pulled back a few days later after experiencing some residual soreness. That set Franco back a couple weeks, but he&#8217;s been in Durham&#8217;s lineup each of the past two nights.\nA two-day rehab stint after an absence of this length doesn&#8217;t give Franco much time to get back into a rhythm, but the Rays are also facing one of their most important series of the year. Tampa Bay trails the Yankees by five games, and this weekend&#8217;s series will be the teams&#8217; final meeting of the regular season. For the Rays to have a realistic chance at winning the AL East, they&#8217;ll probably have to at least take two of three to gain a game in the standings. Getting Franco back certainly helps those efforts, even if his second season in the majors hasn&#8217;t gone as smoothly as they&#8217;d have hoped.\nThe sport&#8217;s consensus top prospect before his promotion last summer, Franco hit .288/.347/.463 through his first 70 MLB games. He already looked like one of the sport&#8217;s top overall players, but the switch-hitting infielder has taken a bit of a step back in his sophomore campaign. He carries a .260/.308/.396 line through 247 trips to the plate. He&#8217;s been one of the league&#8217;s toughest players to strike out, but his power production has taken a bit of a step back. Franco has also had a pair of extended IL stints, missing a month due to a quad strain before this hamate issue.\nRelatively slow start aside, there&#8217;s no question Franco represents a marked upgrade over the Rays other options at shortstop. Tampa Bay has primarily turned to Taylor Walls there in his absence. A former highly-regarded prospect himself (albeit not one of Franco&#8217;s caliber), Walls has stumbled to a .176/.267/.282 line over 408 trips to the dish.\nFranco was joined on his rehab stint by Tyler Glasnow, who tossed an inning on 19 pitches last night for Durham. It marked the big right-hander&#8217;s first game action since he underwent Tommy John surgery last August. Glasnow, who signed an extension two weeks back, continues to pursue a late-season return to the club. There&#8217;s a bit less than a month remaining on the regular season schedule, but the 29-year-old could factor in as an abbreviated starter or reliever for the stretch run and postseason if all goes according to plan.\nIt wasn&#8217;t all positive news on the injury front for the Rays, as they&#8217;re shutting down one of their top prospects for the season. Infielder Curtis Mead is out for the year with a forearm/elbow issue, tweets Triple-A broadcaster Patrick Kinas. Mead, a 21-year-old third baseman/second baseman, raked at a .305/.394/.548 clip through 56 games with Double-A Montgomery. That earned him a bump to Durham in late June, where he&#8217;d been off to a .278/.376/.486 start before the injury.\nThat monster showing has elevated Mead&#8217;s prospect status. Baseball America slotted the Australia native 3rd in an excellent Tampa Bay system and 24th overall on its most recent Top 100 prospect rankings. While he&#8217;s yet to make his major league debut, he&#8217;ll no doubt be added to the 40-man roster this winter to keep him from being selected in the Rule 5 draft. With a strong start to next season for the Bulls, Mead could factor into the Rays infield by the middle part of next season.",

Normal programming was halted and blanket coverage of the historic event was uniform across ABC, SBS, Nine, Seven, Ten and Sky News Australia.The formal announcement from Buckingham Palace was too late to make the front page of Friday’s newspapers, coming as it did at 3.30am.

        "description": "Two people were injured in a shooting in Uvalde, Texas, on Thursday evening, and authorities took four suspects into custody, police said.\n\n\n\nThe Uvalde Police Department said the two injured are juveniles who were sent to San Antonio hospitals. Their conditions are unknown.\n\n\n\nThe shooting occured in Uvalde Memorial Park, police said, which is located roughly a mile from where a gunman shot and killed 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School on May 24.\n\n\n\n“Anyone who was in the area with information, videos or pictures of the shooting, we urge you to contact the Uvalde Police Department Criminal Investigation Division,” the agency said in a statement.\n\n\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said he had spoken with Uvalde’s mayor and the county judge, adding that gang members were allegedly responsible for the shooting.\n\n\n\n“Thank you to all local and state law enforcement and first responders who swiftly went into action to protect their fellow Texans,” he said in a statement. “Gang violence has no place here in Texas, and we will bring the full force of justice down on these heinous criminals.”\n\n\n\nAbbott added that he has directed the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) to conduct patrol operations in “gang hotspots” in the area and sent six additional trooper units to work around the clock.\n\n\n\n“We are working with the Uvalde Police Department and Sheriff’s Office following a suspected gang related shooting at Memorial Park,” Texas DPS said in a tweet. “This information is preliminary, as the situation develops we will work with local law enforcement to provide updates.”\n\n\n\nStudents in Uvalde returned to school this week, although the former Robb Elementary students are now being taught at different schools in the town.\n\n\n\nThe massacre, along with a mass shooting 10 days earlier in Buffalo, N.Y., reignited a debate in Washington about gun control measures.\n\n\n\nThe next month, lawmakers ultimately passed a gun safety package with bipartisan support, breaking a years long stalemate.\n\n\n\nThe package includes provisions like enhancing background checks for gun purchasers between the age of 18 and 21, providing funding for states to administer red flag laws and closing the so-called \"boyfriend loophole.\"",

        "description": "Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Yankees needed one big hit most of the night, and it never came. I’m not sure how to feel about this one. The Yankees had won four in a row, and it’s always hard to get a mop, no matter who you’re playing. Their starter was capped from the outset, and the lineup resembled a spring training game more than a September showdown with a potential playoff opponent. If there was one game to give in this series, it was this one. Yet it was still annoying, the offense should have done more, and the Yankees lost to the Twins, 4-3.\nMiguel Andújar was the extra man for yesterday’s doubleheader, and immediately returned to Triple-A Scranton last night. However, with DJ LeMahieu moved to the IL earlier today, Miggy was back up with the club, and boy did he make the Yankees look smart in the second inning:\n\nThe Yankees were ahead 2-0 in the second inning! That was also pretty much all that they did offensively for most of the game! Usually, it’s been Aaron Judge driving the big home run to get the Yankees in business early before the team goes to sleep for a couple of innings, but today, that was Andújar’s job with his first of the season in the majors.\nWe knew that Nestor Cortes came into the game with a pitch limit, making his first start in 18 days after an IL stint. and I think it’s safe to assume the limit was somewhere around 60. He threw 11 in a sparkling first inning, but our old friend Gio Urshela ate up a chunk of Cortes’ allotted pitches leading off the second, seeing nine.\nStill, despite that, Cortes was terrific, nay, perfect, through four innings. He only had a couple of strikeouts, but retired all 12 men he saw, including getting Carlos Correa himself on a nifty fielding play — he also struck Correa out in the first inning, to the delight of the Yankee Stadium crowd.\nUrshela proved to be the bane of Nestor’s existence tonight, though. He led off the fourth with a single to break up the run of perfection, but of course the pitch count was never going to allow a serious pursuit. The former Yankee moved to second on what should have been a passed ball, which was darkly amusing given that Gary Sánchez was standing at the plate. Shortly thereafter, Sánchez drove a ball into the gap to make it 2-1. Nestor’s night was over, and Clarke Schmidt was left to navigate the runner on second with nobody out.\n\nA walk, a strikeout, and Schmidt just needed a ground ball to escape the inning, but got the wrong kind of groundball, as Nick Gordon found a hole to make it 2-2. Both runs were charged to Cortes, but it wouldn’t be until the eighth that things got out of hand.\nWandy Peralta had the inning, and went to cover first on a weak Jake Cave grounder. Failing to receive the ball cleanly, he pinned it against his belly, which was ruled to not be having control of the ball, and Cave was awarded first base despite Peralta’s foot clearly beating him to the bag. Greg Weissert came into the game two batters later, taking on Correa, who of course, did what he does:\n\nJudge did his best to get the Yankees back in it, leading off the bottom half with a double, moving to third on a groundout, and coming home on a wild pitch that Sánchez couldn’t corral. With the score 4-3, runners on the corners and two out, Giancarlo Stanton saw his first action since Monday, a nine-pitch showdown that nevertheless ended in a strikeout, way ahead of a curveball in the dirt.\nThat left things up to the ninth inning, with Judge due up fourth. It’s a sign of his season, and the state of the roster, that we were all thinking “just get it to Judge.” He’s having the best season by a Yankee since Alex Rodriguez, but even in A-Rod’s best years, 2005 or 2007, the lineup was deep enough that even though Alex was The Guy, he didn’t need to be The Guy every time. It feels like Judge has to be The Guy all the time.\nTonight, he didn’t really have to be. Oswald Peraza singled, and Aaron Hicks managed a double into right to put two men in scoring position with one out. Of course, Rocco Baldelli, a coward, put Judge on intentionally. All Gleyber Torres had to do was get a ball in the air to the outfield, or, honestly, take four pitches from Michael Fulmer, not known as a strike thrower.\n  \n        \n  \nUnfortunately, home-plate umpire Larry Vanover forced Gleyber’s hand with a truly terrible strike two. The first strike was arguable, it looked worse on TV than Statcast had it, but it was borderline. The second wasn’t close, and it forces Gleyber to swing at the final pitch. Isiah Kiner-Falefa bounced out to end the game.\nThis was a frustrating one, and like most losses this year can be blamed on the lineup disappearing for four or five innings at a time. Still, the Yankees took three of four and can tool up to take on Tampa in what might be the biggest series of the season, with the first game coming Friday night at 7:05pm Eastern with Frankie Montas facing Drew Rasmussen.\nBox Score",

        "description": "Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Breaking News: LOL LMAO THEY DID IT Nice Try, Yankees, but the Twins only lose 99 out of every 100 games at Yankee Stadium! Forgot that little tid-bit didn’t you, New York? FOOLS. ABSOLUTE FOOLS.\nThe 2nd started in typical Twins/Yankees style, when Twins legend and current Yankee (TRAITOR) Isiah Kiner-Falefa singled off Sonny (short for Sonald.) Gray and then advanced to 2nd door to Twins infielder oopsie-whoops.™ After fellow old-friend Marwin Gonzalez moved IKF over to 3rd with a groundout, Miguel Andujar took Gray deep to give the Yankerinos an early 2 run lead. This wasn’t very surprising as Andujar has hit, let me check my notes here, 0 home runs before.\nThe Twins got their first baserunner in the 5th, when Gio Gonzalez lead off with a single. Fellow villain-turned-hero Gary Sanchez then doubled him in, presumably forgetting that he and Gio are Twins now and aren’t supposed to do good things at Yankee Stadium. Gilberto Celestino pulled off an Arraez-tier walk, and then an out later Nick Gordon singled the game tied.\nPOP QUIZ HOT SHOT: You are a playoff contending team fighting for your life, looking to capitalize on a strong inning against quite possibly the best team in Baseball. Do you,\nA: Let Billy Hamilton, starting LF, hit.\nB: Bring in actual real MLB player still Jake Cave.\nC: Have a better roster.\nThe answer apparently is B, and Cave would immediately line into a double play to end the inning.\nDon’t worry, however, Cave would redeem himself in the 8th by reaching on an error and then simply existing while Carlos goshdarned Correa hit a two run dingerdongerdigerdinkerdandydoo to put the Twins ahead.\nJorge Lopez would get the bottom of the 8th, starting with Aaron Judge. That went about how you would expect and Judge was then on second. After a walk, a couple of outs, a wild pitch letting Judge score, and whatever this was\n\n\nWait what? Excuse me? pic.twitter.com/Ux83Zjru38— Tawny Jarvi (@TawnyFroggy) September 9, 2022\n\n\n\nCaleb Thielbar came in to face pinch hitter Giancarlo Stanton. Somehow this worked, and Stanton struck out to end the inning. The Twins tried to score in the 9th, but pinch-runner Caleb Hamilton (literally who? How many Hamiltons do we need?) was picked off like a dork. \nAfter getting on out, and giving up a single in the bottom of the 9th, Thielbar was swapped for Michael Fulmer, who immediately loaded the bases, as you do. Somehow, against the very will of the universe, against all logic and reasoning, Fulmer, the abolute mad lad, went ahead and got the next two hitters out and the Twins won a game in New York.\nWow.\nSTUDS: Thielbar/Fulmer: Didn’t blow it                 Correa: 2 RUN DONG BAY-BEEEEE                 Gio/Gary: Playing for the good guys.\nDUDS: Both of the Hamiltons for being low-hanging fruit in a team with Miranda.\nGO TWONKS GO\nComment of the Day goes to James Fillmore for this fun fact:\n“Radio fact: the last Twins pitcher to get a save in Yankee Stadium was Glen Perkins, in 2013. And Hicks was in CF.”",
