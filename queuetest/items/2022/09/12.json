        "description": "Photo by Eve Kilsheimer/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Baseball will look different next year. </p> Ryne Nelson had the best pitching debut in team history. Will he stick in the rotation?\n<p>Makakilo:  Yes.  His debut showed his potential with 7 scoreless innings.  His fastball averaged 95.1 MPH with an outstanding -5.0 run value per 100 pitches (RV/100).  His changeup’s -7.0 RV/100 was outstanding.  His slider had a 75% whiff rate. Data from Baseball Savant. </p>\n<p>It bears noting that two previous Diamondback debuts with 6 scoreless innings (Archie Bradley and Zack Godley) failed to reach their expected level of success as a starter.  Ryne Nelson will likely have more success than they did because of Brent Strom’s coaching and an improved Diamondbacks coaching system. </p>\n<p>James: He will for a while, especially since the organization is taking its time with the pitching prospects and, for whatever reason, this front office seems incredibly reluctant to move starters to the bullpen before it is a season or two too late for there to be a reasonable payoff. However, I am still not convinced he will stick in the rotation over the long haul.</p>\n<p>DBacksEurope: At least for this season! Time will tell if he sticks for longer. The Padres aren’t a team with a very good BA but it was still a terrific accomplishment to keep them in check. Jim’s comment on his “adrenaline” was noted on other outlets as well, so that might have been part of his success in his debut. Besides Gallen and Kelly every starting pitcher has a reasonable chance to be a member of the 2023 rotation, so Nelson’s is as good as any.</p>\n<p>ISH95: Way to early to say either way. I think we’ll see him in the rotation for the last three weeks, but all bets are off after that. I’d be willing to bet at least one, maybe two, members of the Opening Day starting rotation aren’t even on the team right now.</p>\n<p>Justin: Way too early to say. Tyler Gilbert threw a no hitter in his first start. </p>\n<p>Dano: Given how he looked in his first start, I sure hope so. That said, Justin makes a very good point. We shall see, I suppose.</p>\n<p>Wesley: I think he’s likely to stick as at least an average starter. That said, TINSTAPP, et cetera, et cetera.</p>\nWho among the 2022 relievers should be in the 2023 D-backs bullpen?\n<p>Justin: This is a joke right? Uh, Kyle Nelson, Middleton, maybe someone like Tommy Henry could be the long guy. </p>\n<p>James: I guess it depends on which Caleb Smith, and Middleton show up. Otherwise, I wouldn’t bring any of them back. Fill the pen with new arms, maybe convert a starter or two as well.</p>\n<p>Makakilo:  The following six, five of whom have more than 1 option to provide flexibility that will improve next season’s results (ERA+ through 8 September).</p>\n\nKyle Nelson, 278 ERA+, 2options\nKeynam Middleton, 213 ERA+, 1 option\nTyler Holton, 142 ERA+, 3 options\nJoe Mantiply, 139 ERA+, 3 options\nReyes Moronta, 115 ERA+, 2 options\nCaleb Smith, 95 ERA+, 3 options\n\n<p>DBacksEurope: every non 32+ year old reliever, that’s obvious.</p>\n<p>ISH95: launch them all into the sun. Personally, I lay the lion’s share of the blame this season at the feet of the bullpen, and frankly don’t see a single redeemable member between them at this point.</p>\n<p>Dano: Kyle Nelson’s probably the only one I can think of, though honestly maybe Joe Mantiply as well, even though he has come down to Earth. I like Joe.</p>\n<p>Wesley: Nelson, I guess? Really it depends on how the look over the spring. </p>\nThe MLB competition committee have come up with the following rule changes. On the SnakePit scale (Great/Good/Meh/Bad/Terrible), what do you think of each, and why? \nBelow each change are the results of the SnakePit poll.\nPitch timer\n<p>32% Great!, 26% Good, 21% Meh.., 12% Bad 9% Terrible!</p>\n<p>Justin: I like it. I like the no pickoffs after 3 attempts. I am going with good. </p>\n<p>Makakilo:  Great!  The rule has parts that involve the pitcher, the catcher, the batter, pickoffs, and mound visits.  Overall, it will speed up the game with some balance.  </p>\n<p>James: I suppose I will go with good. Frankly, much of it boils down to how well it is policed. After all, there is already a time limit in place on the books. If MLB had bothered to enforce the existing rules, this wouldn’t be a necessary change to begin with. But, I am not opposed to it. I am less of a fan of the clock going with runners on and with the pickoff rules, but I’m also not sure that the changes also impacting holding the runner are going to make much of a change in this modern era of risk avoidance. </p>\n<p>DBacksEurope: Good. An eternity before throwing a pitch should be banned, just like batters stepping out of the box after every pitch or adjusting the strips of their gloves bla bla bla…All bullshit.</p>\n<p>ISH95: Great. It’s nice that they are finally enforcing the rule that has always been on the books, even if they added an extra 12 seconds. AZFL games are noticeably faster paced with the pitch clock in effect, even when it still ends up being a long game due to offense, like the last one I went to. Bring it on, and let the Bumgarners of the league complain. I’ll put their tears in my morning coffee.</p>\n<p>Dano: Great, assuming they actually enforce it.</p>\n<p>Wesley: Meh. I’m ambivalent. Love that it would speed up the game if enforced, however I also am a sadist who loves all the weird tics and mind games on the mound. </p>\nBanning infield shifts\n<p>23% Great!, 24% Good, 17% Meh..., 17% Bad, 19% Terrible!</p>\n<p>Justin: Probably in the minority on this one, I will go with good. Come on…does Alex Avila really need to be shifted? I am not anti infield shifts, it 100% has a place, but sometimes it’s just….</p>\n<p>Makakilo:  Terrible!  This change will hurt the Diamondbacks more than any other team in the Majors.  The Diamondbacks’ infield shifts may have gained more Defensive Runs Saved than any other team in the Majors per The Fielding Bible (25 DRS shifted minus negative 10 unshifted).  </p>\n<p>James: Terrible. It is a solution without a true problem. Does Alex Avila need to be shifted on? Why wouldn’t you? Put the players in the best position to make outs, regardless of who is at the plate. As for opening up the field and creating more action, I am still not sold that the outcome is going to be what so many are hoping for. The players certainly are not convinced, and MLB taking the approach of entirely ignoring player feedback is not going to help the future of the sport. Ask me again in ten years, once we have a meaningful sample size and the bean counters have had a chance to adjust to the new reality. I would not be surprised if this actually leads to a higher incidence of left-handed TTO and even shorter average outings from starting pitching, perhaps with six full innings becoming as uncommon as seven are now.</p>\n<p>DBacksEurope: Meh. The game evolves and if shifts were a part of it those that spray balls become more valuable. </p>\n<p>ISH95: Bad. One of the big reasons I was against the DH was my perception that it would take away strategy from the game, and this is even worse, since it literally takes away a strategy from the game.</p>\n<p>Justin: Eh, after coming back and reading the other entries I have changed my mind. Bad. </p>\n<p>Dano: I’m going to go out on a limb and call it good, though I think all of the arguments made above are valid. For me, I simply enjoyed watching baseball more before everyone got all shift-happy.</p>\n<p>Wesley: Meh. The pros and cons are obvious I think. </p>\nBigger bases\n<p>28% Great!, 23% Good, 34% Meh..., 3% Bad, 12% Terrible!</p>\n<p>Justin: Meh. </p>\n<p>Makakilo. Awesomely great!  It will encourage more aggressive baserunning while reducing injuries.  </p>\n<p>James: I was a bit skeptical about this one when it was first bandied about a year or so ago. Now, I think it is pretty meh. If it leads to increased player safety and a more dynamic running game, I can live with it. I have a feeling this will be a pretty big nothing burger in the end. </p>\n<p>DBacksEurope: Great. Not that it is really a rule I think was necessary, but if it improves security and more stolen bases, then I am all in.</p>\n<p>ISH95: Meh. I think it should have at least some impact on player safety, which is always a good thing. No one wants a season decided by a bad play at second. I don’t think it’s going to have any real impact on the running game though, simply because the league has moved on, and 2/10ths of a second difference isn’t going to change that.</p>\n<p>Dano: I was gonna go with bad/terrible/stupid, but after that scary play yesterday when Urena and Perdomo collided at first and both remained on the ground for a very long time, I found myself reconsidering. I think I’m at “meh,” graduating to “good” if baserunning/collision injuries stop happening to a substantial degree.</p>\n<p>Wesley: Great! This reduces the chances of an injury, so I am all for it!</p>\nLet’s pretend each MLB team is a guest at a party. Pick one and tell us what they are doing at the party.\n<p>Justin: </p>\n\nMilwaukee Brewers. Doing steroids. \nLos Angeles Dodgers. Peeing in the backyard pool. \n\n<p>Makakilo:  </p>\n<p>The New York Yankees are freely expressing their opinions about everyone and everything, with nearly zero agreements with anyone else at the party.  They express an air of arrogance and entitlement to the best food and the best women.</p>\n<p>Dano: I was going to go with the Yankees, but Makakilo basically nailed it and I have nothing to add to that beyond perhaps some invective and cocaine, neither of which is strictly speaking necessary. Nicely done, Mak! So.</p>\n<p>I guess I have to go with the Pirates, who hang out at the edges of groups and try to involve themselves in ongoing conversation between the other guests, but everyone else keeps mistaking them for staff: trying to hand them their empty drinks and asking them to refill the empty pretzel bowls and expecting them to wipe up spills and stuff and wondering volubly why they aren’t doing their f***ing jobs. (Sorry, Ramona….)</p>\n<p>DBacksEurope: … [Jim: DBacksEurope is clearly DBacksSwitzerland for this question!]</p>\n<p>ISH95: The Arizona Diamondbacks are the middle aged person who is hanging out with people they are no longer relatable to, trying to convince people they’re still cool by telling stories about their exploits as part of the class of 2001</p>\n<p>Wesley: The Mariners are the ones who never make it to the after party, because they’re just too weird, even though they do some cool stuff once in a while. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Terry Francona’s contract is up after the season, and the veteran manager told The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal that he has been in talks with team officials about his future with the Guardians.  It seems basically a foregone conclusion that Francona will remain as the Guards’ skipper beyond 2022, and yet given Francona’s multiple health issues, he is cognizant about the potential end of his managerial career.  “I want to enjoy what I’m doing. It’s getting harder to do that, just because physically it’s harder,” Francona said.  “I just want to be careful.  And at the same time, I want to be fair to the team.”  The respect goes both ways with Cleveland’s front office, as president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti said that “I want to make sure [Francona] never feels he has this obligation to keep doing the job because he owes us anything.  I want him to do what’s best for him.”</p>\n<p>Antonetti and team owner Paul Dolan have both said in the past that Francona can manage the Guardians for essentially as long as he feels up to the job, while Francona told Rosenthal that he might have already retired if he had been with any other team.  Speculatively, it would seem like any sort of formal contract extension between the two sides could perhaps take the form of a one-year deal with a rolling option, to be exercised should Francona feel he is ready to keep managing beyond 2023.  A decision might not be made until after Francona’s latest medical procedure takes place in the offseason — he is scheduled to have drains removed from his back, and Francona estimates that this will be roughly his 46th surgery.</p>\n<p>Some items from around both the AL and NL Central divisions….</p>\n\nBack on August 11, Tim Anderson underwent surgery to fix a torn ligament in his left middle finger, and White Sox acting manager Miguel Cairo told reporters (including Ryan Taylor of NBC Sports Chicago) today that Anderson was scheduled to visit a hand specialist on Tuesday.  “We’re going to see from there” what the next step is in Anderson’s rehab, Cairo said, adding that the shortstop is “doing good.”  Anderson was hitting .301/.339/.395 over his first 351 plate appearances of the season.  Assuming the visit with the specialist goes well, there should still be time for Anderson to properly rehab and get back to the White Sox before the season is over, thus giving the Sox a big late boost in their push for the AL Central crown.\nWhile the Pirates aren’t in a pennant race, they’re also expecting a key player back in closer David Bednar, as GM Ben Cherington said in an interview with 93.7 The Fan radio (hat tip to MLB.com’s Justice delos Santos).  Bednar has been out of action since late July due to lower back inflammation, but Bednar threw a bullpen session yesterday and Cherington said Bednar could begin a rehab assignment this week.  The right-hander has emerged as a major bullpen weapon (and popular trade ask) over the last two seasons, with Bednar posting a 2.70 ERA and a superb 33.5% strikeout rate over 46 2/3 innings in 2022.\nThe Cubs’ season “has been a success” in the view of chairman Tom Ricketts, who told The Chicago Tribune’s Paul Sullivan and other reporters that he has been impressed by the team’s progress in bringing along its young players and young pitchers.  Since the Cubs’ last rebuild resulted in the 2016 World Series championship, Ricketts feels that “having done it once, and largely with the same people, it gives me a lot of confidence that we’ll do it the right way again.”  As to whether or not the Cubs will start to invest more into payroll this winter, Ricketts somewhat vaguely said that president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer has “got a lot of flexibility, and we’ll let him do it,” adding that the “ball is in Jed’s court when it comes to how and where” any funds are invested.  Of course, this isn’t exactly a full-on declaration that the Cubs are ready to start spending big, as while Seiya Suzuki and Marcus Stroman were two more expensive additions last winter, Hoyer stuck mostly to less-costly, shorter-term free agents.",

But the name Charles Cullen has mostly been absent from the genre, the hows and whys of which might be somewhat explained by the intermittently effective Netflix drama The Good Nurse, a mixed bag of shock, horror and frustration.</p><p>Because telling the story of Cullen is far from easy: his crimes are scattered, his victim count unknown and his motives mysterious. The beats of his story don’t fit into the slick structure we know too well, and in this cold and surprisingly cynical film, we see the struggle of trying to make them. Between the 1990s and the 2000s, Cullen, as a nurse, killed at least 29 people but authorities believe the number to be closer to 400 – he was a silent killer who used intravenous tubes to poison patients. He’s played by Eddie Redmayne at the tail end of his killings, a new hire at a New Jersey hospital in the early 2000s. He is paired up with Amy (Jessica Chastain), a wearied single mother working night shifts while trying to hide her cardiomyopathy.</p> Continue reading...",

(2:50) Ever heard of Dred Scott, Johnny? (3:54) Secondly: that is hardly the primary reason your court's legitimacy is being questioned. It's being questioned because the Supreme Court has been poisoned by Conservatives. One Justice's wife is an insurrectionist. Another Justice is there because a Senate Majority Leader made up a phony rule. A third is there because the same Leader didn't FOLLOW the phony rule. At least three of them lied to the Senate. Alito gave a political speech mocking anybody who opposed him, or wasn't Catholic. It's time for Chief Justice Roberts to resign! (7:19) Judicial corruption is so pervasive that the \"Special Master\" Trump proposed to a judge he appointed, is the husband of one of the judges he appointed to the appeals court that next gets his case! (7:58) Happily the Department of Justice has offered Judge Cannon a climbdown from her decision to threaten National Security. (10:00) May video from London's Daily Mail has new significance: it shows Trump taking boxes of stuff from Mar-a-Lago to his golf course in New Jersey three days after the National Archives emailed about missing stuff (10:55) and last night we saw more video of Trump and private jets, ferrying him from New Jersey to DC sparking all kinds of speculation with the easiest explanation: he has another golf course near Dulles Airport (11:15) No, I don't know why he went, but the last time we saw him go to a golf course he buried a wife in it. Has Trump got anybody he needs to bury?</p>\r\n<p>B BLOCK: (15:20) EVERY DOG HAS ITS DAY: Janet the Boston Terrier in New Jersey (16:40) POSTSCRIPTS TO THE NEWS: Looks like the Russians are losing badly in Ukraine; a Kansas sheriff thinks he's going to war against the IRS, and the Royal Beekeeper has let the bees know the bad news about Queen Elizabeth. (19:55) IN SPORTS: Mahomes' hand is fine, Aaron Rodgers' head isn't (and it's probably my fault), who drew the line at Soldier Field, and Baseball shorts Doc White (24:10) THE WORST PERSONS IN THE WORLD: CNN's Jake Tapper vies with Mike Pence and Kimberly \"The New King Is My Friend\" Guilfoyle for the honors.</p>\r\n<p>C BLOCK: (29:05) THINGS I PROMISED NOT TO TELL: The strange tale of how ESPN wanted me to take on New York radio legends (and illiterates) Francesa and Russo, but fate intervened.</p><p>See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.</p>",

Email deliverability is deliberately nerfed by Big Tech...  Hellbanning everybody except for other big email providers is lazy and conveniently dishonest. It uses spam as a scapegoat to nerf deliverability and stifle competition. Nowadays, if you want to build services on top of email, you have to pay an email sending API which has been blessed by others in the industry. One of them. This concept may sound familiar to you.

        "description": "<p>Wise, witty, patient, crisp, faintly martyred or skydiving with James Bond … our film critic looks at how cinema portrayed the monarch – and recalls the night she put him on the spot at Windsor Castle</p><p>Only very recently did the Queen make her screen breakthrough. Like British Shakespearean stage veterans who suddenly find themselves in a huge movie franchise late in life, the monarch found herself knocking it out of the park with a superstarring role in the 2012 London Olympics, opposite Daniel Craig’s 007. And Craig looked almost paralysed by his co-star’s prestige, walking stiffly down the Palace corridor alongside her and the corgis, with an odd, pursed-lipped expression, perhaps unsure of how – or if – to signal his own awareness of the comic craziness underlying this unprecedented event.</p><p>With her Olympic walk-on, the Queen had astonished, thrilled and even slightly shocked some of her audience, who perhaps feared she might be embarrassed or demeaned if it all somehow went wrong. They needn’t have worried. She sailed through it. And at the platinum jubilee in February, when she played herself opposite another Brit cinema franchise icon, Paddington Bear, she was even more relaxed, gleefully producing the marmalade sandwich from her handbag and cheerfully tapping out the rhythm to Queen’s We Will Rock You on her teacup.</p> Continue reading...",

It’s a story that people really, really need to hear.”</p><p>The story of Iphigenia – the daughter of the Greek general Agamemnon and his wife Clytemnestra, who was sacrificed to the gods – is transplanted by Welsh playwright Gary Owen to Splott, a deprived area of Cardiff. A damning account of a country gutted by austerity, it takes the form of a monologue narrated by Effie, a gobby young woman who sneers and scoffs at the audience only to break in front of us. The play is brutally effective in depicting the human cost of the cuts and closures, ending on a note of accusatory fury.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p>The French writer’s record of an obsessive affair with a Russian diplomat is a riveting, sexually frank study of a woman in the throes of love and lust</p><p>In 1988, the award-winning French writer Annie Ernaux went on a junket to Soviet Russia. On the last day of the tour, in Leningrad, she began an affair with a married Russian diplomat from the Soviet embassy in France. He was 35; she was 48. When they returned to Paris they kept it up. Getting Lost (now published in translation) is the unaltered, original journal that Ernaux wrote during their 18 months together.</p><p>This was a period of her life when she admits to being lethargic from sex and thus useless for work (“Intense desire keeps me from working”). Yet this affair has produced not one but two books. Simple Passion, her novel-like memoir of the same fling, is probably her best-known work (along with The Years, her masterpiece, an artistic retelling of postwar French history as experienced by a woman). Like Anna Karenina and Madame Bovary, Ernaux’s affair should be counted as one of the great liaisons of literature. She writes honest, deeply felt books while the others were pioneers of what, post-Ferrante, we now call the “invention of women”. Her subversion is not simply the subversion of gender – a woman writing about her own affair, which was historically the dominion of men – but her sexual frankness, which has a way of making such elaborate inventions seem needless.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Mark Payton homered twice, including a walk-off homer, for Charlotte. | Laura Wolff/Charlotte Knights\n    \n\n  <p>Winston-Salem and Kannapolis finish their seasons, while Mark Payton gets two homers with Charlotte</p>   \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n<p>Charlotte made a huge, six-run comeback in the ninth to win Sunday’s game, 7-6. Mark Payton homered in the first, and again in the ninth. </p>\n<p>He was responsible for the very first run.</p>\n\n\n<p>1st pitch to @MarkPayton2 =   pic.twitter.com/PobXWhqsH3</p>— Charlotte Knights (@KnightsBaseball) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>And he was responsible for the final three runs that won the game, with his second homer.</p>\n\n\n<p>QUIETED THE SOUNDS!!!!! @MarkPayton2 with the WALK-OFF   pic.twitter.com/g3RKTYK3IF</p>— Charlotte Knights (@KnightsBaseball) September 12, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Payton still needed some help today, and Xavier Fernández provided a little of that. He was the only other hitter with two hits, one of which was a double. Payton and Fernández had the only extra-base hits today. The team was 3-for-4 with runners in scoring position, so they did not have a lot of opportunity to get easier runs.</p>\n<p>John Parke started today, as one of those rare Charlotte starting pitchers. However, he was pulled after three innings, thanks to four runs allowed in the third. The bullpen, aside from Lane Ramsey, had a good day though. Kade McClure continues to have a much better time lately as a bullpen arm. Jason Bilous had the best day, with six up and six down and three strikeouts. Matt Foster, back with the Knights, got the win.</p>\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n<p>Project Birmingham was on display on Sunday, for good and bad. The bad first, as this was a loss for the Barons, after all. Cristian Mena started today, and he has been bad since his promotion from the Dash. He came into the game with a 6.30 ERA in Double-A, and it pretty much stayed the same, with three innings and two earned runs today. One of the two errors from Adam Hackenberg contributed to a third, unearned, run. The pen was not great after Mena, either.</p>\n<p>The offense certainly did not bring their A-game, with five hits, four walks — and 15 strikeouts. Nine runners on base should get you five runs. However, for the Barons today, all five runs came from the home run. DJ Gladney hit his first Double-A homer — there’s something in the water, because like Colson Montgomery on Saturday, that first homer was a grand slam.</p>\n\n\n<p>DJ Gladney erases the deficit with a grand slam! #Barons tied at 4.  #WhiteSox #GoDJ pic.twitter.com/7nT5K0i7j4</p>— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Wilfred Veras collected the fifth and final run, with his second Double-A homer. JJ Muno, unlike Gladney and Veras not a member of Project Birmingham, had the most hits of the day, with two.</p>\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n<p>Today’s opener for the Dash was a close win. The offense came out hot, and the arms did just enough to keep the lead after seven innings. The offense’s five runs came from some scrappy play, with two of them unearned. Seven of the nine bats in the lineup had at least one hit. Ben Norman led the team with two, and had one of the two extra-base hits as well. He also stole a base, for good measure. Norman was not the only guy to reach base multiple times though, as Alsander Womack joined him.</p>\n<p>Brooks Gosswein and the pitching staff did just enough for the win. Gosswein did give up the lead once after giving up runs in the first and second, but the offense picked him up. The final two arms were the best today, in Skylar Arias and Luis Amaya. They shut down the Cyclones in the final two innings to keep the lead and get the win. It was Amaya’s third High-A save this season.</p>\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n<p>With this nightcap win, the Winston-Salem Dash’s season is over. This was another close win, for the doubleheader sweep. This one went to extras, as the Dash won it on a walk-off Caberea Weaver single — though it probably should be ruled an error, see for yourself.</p>\n\n\n<p>Caberea Weaver with a hard single to 2B that brings in Al Womack. The #Dash walk it off 4-3 in extras in the final game of the season. They sweep the DH. #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/w4nltIImhF</p>— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Tommy Sommer had another great start, and deserved the win. He went four scoreless with just three runners allowed. He lowered his High-A ERA to 2.64 on his season, and maybe he should get a congratulations-on-the-season promotion to the Barons now. Chase Plymell gave up the runs to the Cyclones in the nightcap, allowing all three runs in the sixth while recording two outs. It’s never good to allow more runs than outs. </p>\n<p>The lackluster offense needed every break to get to four runs, as that video showed above. W-S did not have an extra-base hit, and three of the five hits came from Weaver. So, there was not much help in getting all four of those runs with the bat. Opposing pitchers helped a bit more, walking the Dash seven times. </p>\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n<p>In the final game of the season for Kannapolis, the Cannon Ballers came back after allowing a five-run third to win the game, 6-5. They only needed six hits to do it, with help from four walks, so they needed every single one of those runners on base to eke out the win. The 2022 draft class led the way at the top of the lineup: Jordan Sprinkle, Brooks Baldwin, and Jacob Burke combined for four of the RBI today. </p>\n\n\n<p>Jacob Burke lines one past the SS and Misael Gonzalez and Brooks Score. #Ballers trail 5-4. #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/AH52L06Mgu</p>— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>It was Michael Turner’s second game, so he did not come up with his first professional hit and he probably won't until 2023, but he still reached twice on walks.</p>\n<p>It was all about the 2022 draft class on the mound, as well. Jonathan Cannon got the start and went 2 1⁄3 innings. He didn’t strike out many batters in his first stint in pro ball, but he had a decent start nonetheless with a 1.42 ERA. He was pulled after giving up a run in the third. Shane Murphy came in next and couldn’t get anything going, giving up four to put the Cannon Ballers in a 5-0 hole. The rest of the bullpen kept it there for the offense to eventually come back for the win. Out of the pen, Kole Ramage was best, with 2 1⁄3 scoreless innings right after Murphy was pulled. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) battles a well-hidden threat in Secret Invaders. </p>\n<p>There was tons of Marvel goodness at this weekend's D23 Expo. The studio released the first teaser trailer for Secret Invasion, the six-episode crossover event series featuring Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, as well as a trailer for a Halloween TV special, Werewolf by Night, based on the Marvel Comics character. Those in attendance were also treated to sneak peek footage from several upcoming Marvel projects: Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Loki S2, The Marvels, Ironheart, and Echo, among others.</p>\nSecret Invasion\n<p>Secret Invasion is based on the 2008 storyline from the comic books. It's part of Phase Five of the MCU, and Feige has said that the crossover event will tie into future Marvel films. The scope won't be quite as large in terms of the number of characters and will instead focus on Fury and the political intrigue and intergalactic espionage of the comics storyline, as well as illuminating things that took place during the Blip. Don Cheadle's James \"Rhode\" Rhodes will appear, as will Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill, Martin Freeman's Everett K. Ross, and Dermot Mulroney as US President Ritson. The cast also includes Kingsley Ben-Adir as the primary villain, as well as Olivia Coleman, Emilia Clarke, and Killian Scott.</p>\n<p>The basic premise is that a rebel faction of shapeshifting Skrulls have been infiltrating Earth. Fury will team up with his former Skrull ally, Talos (Ben Mendelsohn), to thwart the invading Skrulls. The teaser shows a bearded, rather scruffy-looking Fury returning to Earth after a long absence, to the surprise of Maria Hill, who has been trying to contact him for years. Clearly, there is a serious threat. We see Fury meeting with Rhodes and asking how well he really knows his security detail. Because Skrulls can shapeshift into anyone, how can you know if someone is a human or a Skrull? \"I'm the last person standing between them and what they really want,\" Fury says, but we don't know yet what that might be.</p><p>Read 10 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

Three years later it rebranded its service to Ace Stream, after which it took off. </p>\n<p>The original name reveals that the streaming application relies on a torrent engine built into the widely popular VLC media player. This combination results in a peer-to-peer streaming mechanism that doesn’t rely on central servers. </p>\n<p>This concept empowers the public to use an open tool to stream content to the masses, without relying on third-party streaming platforms. That’s proven to be a great idea that has received widespread support.</p>\n<p>In 2013, Ace Stream received financial support from Google to present the technology at Techweek Chicago. Around the same time, it also received a grant from the European Union. This allowed the company, which is incorporated in Ukraine as Innovative Digital Technologies LLC, to improve and optimize its streaming tool. </p>\nThird-Party Piracy\n<p>Today, millions of people regularly use Ace Stream. This includes a subset of pirates, who utilize the software to rebroadcast copyrighted live streams, including many sports matches. </p>\n<p>Rightsholders are obviously not pleased with this activity. However, Ace Stream is a content-neutral piece of software, similar to web browsers, media players, or regular torrent clients.</p>\n<p>Where normal torrent clients use .torrent files and magnet links, Ace Stream relies on Ace Stream Content IDs and transport files to find and play streams instead. These are similar to .torrent files and info hashes that normal torrent clients use. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The IDs are not hosted, organized, or maintained by Ace Stream. Instead, users of the software generate the links which can then be shared anywhere on the web. This is similar to how .torrent files are distributed.</p>\n‘We Don’t Publish or Host Content’\n<p>Speaking with TorrentFreak, Ace Stream’s Roman Morozyuk stresses that the company and its software are simply a content-neutral tool. </p>\n<p>“Ace Stream is not a content provider or a hosting service. We do not publish and we do not store any video or audio content. This automatically excludes the possibility of us violating video or audio content copyrights,” Morozyuk says.</p>\n<p>The decentralized nature of the streaming platform also means that implementing filters or blacklists, as rightsholders often insist, isn’t a viable option. Ace Stream sees this decentralized nature as its main selling point, but rightsholders disagree.</p>\nISPs Ordered to Block Ace Stream\n<p>A few weeks ago these tensions escalated when Ace Stream was added to Spain’s piracy blocklist following a complaint from LaLiga. This means that local Internet providers have to block access to the streaming player. </p>\n<p>This is a controversial decision, as noted by BandaAncha, because the software doesn’t link to or host any copyrighted content. Even worse, Ace Stream says that it wasn’t informed about the blocking request, so it couldn’t defend itself.</p>\n<p>“We did not receive any notification from LaLiga or any of its agents about such blocking of the site, and we learned about it by chance, from our users,” Morozyuk says.</p>\n<p>LaLiga shouldn’t have had any problem contacting Ace Stream and both companies have discussed copyright infringement matters in the past. This was triggered by a complaint the Spanish soccer league filed with Google. </p>\nPlay Store Removal\n<p>The organization previously asked Google to remove the Ace Stream software from the Play Store, which it did. However, Ace Stream appealed arguing that it was falsely accused of copyright infringement. </p>\n<p>As it turns out, LaLiga backed up its claims with a screenshot showing how the software was used to stream copyrighted football matches. However, it didn’t clarify that LaLiga loaded these streams themselves by using links from illegal sources. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To Ace Stream, this accusation is akin to asking for the removal of a web browser because it can load an illegal streaming site. Google eventually agreed with the streaming application, which was allowed back into the Play Store, but the trouble didn’t end there. </p>\nFrom EU Funding to EU Blacklist?\n<p>Earlier this year, Ace Stream was shocked to learn that the Audiovisual Anti Piracy Alliance (AAPA) nominated the software for a spot on the EU’s bi-annual Counterfeit and Piracy Watch List.</p>\n<p>AAPA’s submission put the streaming tool in a bucket with other “main content infringers,” including blatantly infringing IPTV services. Needless to say, Ace Stream wasn’t happy so attempted to set the record straight.</p>\n<p>“We sent our justified claims and demands to immediately stop illegal actions against our company that discredit our legal project and our legal products, and also violate the rights of consumers,” Morozyuk notes. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Ace Stream hasn’t heard back from AAPA or the EU yet. If things spiral out of control, the company may eventually take legal steps but, for now, it prefers to resolve the matter through dialogue.</p>\n<p>“We did not file lawsuits yet, since we hope to resolve this entire situation by mutual understanding and out of court,” Morozyuk tells us.</p>\nTalking to Rightsholders\n<p>Thus far, direct discussions with copyright holders have been challenging. Ace Stream had repeated contact with LaLiga, for example, and offered its service to the sports league to generate revenue. </p>\n<p>LaLiga doesn’t seem eager to use Ace Stream, perhaps because it can only make a fraction of the money that centralized streaming platforms offer. </p>\n<p>This means that the tensions between Ace Stream and rightsholders will likely continue. According to the streaming app, resisting decentralized technology is futile, so rightsholders should look for ways to take advantage of it.</p>\n<p>“We have effective solutions that will allow copyright holders to embrace the new reality, where decentralization is gradually becoming the basis of a normal entire Internet, and not to waste their efforts on a futile fight against fully decentralized P2P networks,” Morozyuk says. </p>\n<p>More details on this solution will follow in the near future. Meanwhile, Ace Stream hopes that that the blocking problem and the other piracy allegations will be addressed.</p>\n<p>From: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.</p>",

With her big eyes and rosy cheeks, Di has an endearing mischievousness about her, but even in the games that she plays with other youngsters, the shadow of an archaic tradition looms large. At one point, Di and her friends pretend to act out a “bride kidnapping”, a Hmong custom that during the New Year celebration allows a boy to snatch a girl away and force her into marriage.</p><p>This practice was how her parents met, and it was also how her older sister was married at the age of 14. Most of the housework and farming labour are performed by the women – even Di has to carry wood logs much bigger than herself – while the patriarch spends most of his day drinking. Still, Di is not defined by her restrictive social environment; her bubbly personality instead dominates the screen. From her desire to complete her studies to her crushes on other boys, Di is determined to make her future her own.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p>Beaton’s melancholic and humane memoir records her bleak time under the male gaze in Canada’s oil sands</p><p>Kate Beaton’s new graphic memoir, Ducks: Two Years in the Oil Sands, is, I think, going to come as something of a surprise to her fans, for it could hardly be more different in tone from her popular larky strip Hark! A Vagrant, in which she gently sends up historical figures such as Napoleon and Ada Lovelace. Yes, it’s funny at moments; Beaton’s low-key wryness is present and correct, and her drawings of people are as charming and as expressive as ever. But its mood overall is deeply melancholic. Her story, which runs to more than 400 pages, encompasses not only such thorny matters as social class and environmental destruction; it may be the best book I have ever read about sexual harassment.</p><p>How do men behave when women are (mostly) not around? Alas, the answer is: not terribly well. Ducks is an account of the two years Beaton spent (beginning in 2005) working in the oil sands of Alberta, Canada, a far-off planet to which she travelled from her beloved home in Nova Scotia for the sole purpose of paying off her student loans (in these booming wildernesses, the money is too good for a humanities student from a small rural community to refuse). Naturally, the wrench involved in this move is painful; like just about everyone in the places she is employed – in a town called Fort McMurray and in various camps in outlying areas – she comes from far away and must contend with aching homesickness. But for Beaton there’s something else: her loneliness is exacerbated to an immeasurable degree by the fact that the women there are outnumbered by men by 50 to one.</p><p>Ducks: Two Years in the Oil Sands by Kate Beaton is published by Jonathan Cape (£25).

        "description": "<p>A heavyweight group of former Medicare officials and payment experts are calling on the federal government to overhaul how Medicare pays physicians, which they say has morphed into a system that is “mind-numbingly complex and nontransparent.”</p>\n<p>One of the most integral components of this fee system is the American Medical Association’s Relative Value Scale Update Committee, or RUC, a group of 32 physicians that meets behind closed doors a few times every year. The group advises Medicare on how to value the 8,000 payment codes used for physician services by estimating things like the time it takes to do certain procedures and the overhead costs involved with each code. But in reality, Medicare and other health insurers follow a vast majority of the RUC’s recommendations, essentially resulting in physicians and their lobbying groups setting their own pay.</p><p>Continue to STAT+ to read the full story…</p>",

Addressing her as “Granny”, Harry shared his “great sadness” at the Queen’s death, saying she would be “sorely missed”.

        "description": "<p>The Senate is expected to “start the process” for considering a bill to protect same-sex marriage on the federal level this week, marking the culmination of a months-long effort by Democrats and some Republicans to codify marriage equality after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The House passed the marriage equality bill, titled the Respect for Marriage Act, in a 267-157 vote in July, sending the measure to the Senate for consideration. The 47 Republican “yes” votes fueled Democratic hopes that the legislation could eventually land on President Biden’s desk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Senate is also expected to continue conversations regarding government funding, which has to be passed by Sept. 30 or else Washington will shut down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the House side, lawmakers are returning to the Capitol on Tuesday after the August recess with a full agenda for the final month of legislating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawmakers are pressing leadership for a vote on legislation banning lawmakers from trading stocks, three new members will be sworn into the House following special elections, and lawmakers are slated to vote on a resolution honoring Queen Elizabeth II, who died Thursday at the age of 96.</p>\n\n\n\nSenate to 'start the process' on marriage equality\n\n\n\n<p>Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), both sponsors of the Respect for Marriage Act, told reporters last week that the Senate will “start the process” on the marriage equality legislation this week, kicking off the final step to sending the legislation to Biden for approval.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The senators did not specify how the process would begin, but the first step toward a Senate vote would be filing for cloture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, Democrats and Collins have to wrangle nine more Republicans to join them in backing the measure, or else the bill will fall to a GOP filibuster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is unclear if they will get there, but those close to the negotiations are confident that the bill will cross the finish line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are currently two Republicans publicly in the “yes” column: Collins and Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio), another sponsor of the bill who is retiring at the end of this term. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) previously told reporters that he “probably will” vote for the bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional GOP support could come from an amendment that would address concerns about the bill raising legal problems for religious groups that do not recognize same-sex marriage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Negotiators are expected to finalize those details this week. A number of Republicans have not yet signaled how they will vote on the legislation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Respect for Marriage Act would require that a person be considered marriage if the nuptials were legal in the state where it was performed. It would also allow the attorney general to pursue law enforcement actions and give individuals harmed by a violation of the law a private right of action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the legislation calls for the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, a measure that former President Clinton enacted in 1996 that says marriage is “only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) last week said the upper chamber would vote on the marriage equality bill “in the coming weeks.”</p>\n\n\n\nSenate continues work on government funding\n\n\n\n<p>Senators are expected to continue working on funding the government this week, as the chamber barrels toward the Sept. 30 deadline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawmakers are looking to pass a continuing resolution to keep Washington functioning, which would keep the government funded at the previous year’s spending levels, giving Congress more time to strike a deal. The stopgap is expected to stretch past the midterms and into December.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The focus of government funding talks right now is a measure on permitting reform that Schumer and other party leaders struck with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to ensure his support for the Inflation Reduction Act, which the Senate passed and Biden signed into law last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schumer told reporters last week that it is his “intention” to include the permitting reform deal in the continuing resolution — but that plan is causing a divide in the Democratic Party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I rise this morning to express my strong opposition to the so-called side deal that the fossil fuel industry is pushing to make it easier for them to pollute the environment and destroy our planet,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said on the Senate floor last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He and other progressives in the House are opposing the measure, which is expected to expedite the development of fossil fuel and other energy products by setting maximum timelines for environmental reviews, among other provisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, more than 70 House Democrats — led by Rep. Raúl Grijalva (Ariz.) — penned a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) asking that the permitting reform legislation be kept out of the continuing resolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schumer could include the marriage equality bill in the continuing resolution, which would make it difficult for progressives to vote “no,” but the Democratic leader and Baldwin, a key sponsor, have both said they prefer a separate vote on the measure. Tucking the same-sex marriage bill into the continuing resolution could also decrease GOP support for government funding, threatening a shutdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Senate this week is also scheduled to vote on a number of judicial nominations.</p>\n\n\n\nHouse reconvenes, eyes stock trading ban\n\n\n\n<p>The House is scheduled to reconvene in Washington on Tuesday evening, officially putting an end to the August recess and kicking off the chamber’s final month of legislating before the November midterm elections. The chamber is not slated to be in session in October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A bipartisan coalition of House members are pushing for a vote on legislation to ban lawmakers from trading stocks, which has gained traction among lawmakers on Capitol Hill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a letter to House leaders earlier this month, the group — led by Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) — laid out a consensus framework to reform lawmaker stock trading practices, and requested a floor vote by Sept. 30. Those in the group have previously introduced their own versions of legislation to address lawmaker stock trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The framework says any legislation pertaining to lawmaker stock trading should prohibit all members of Congress, their spouses and minor dependents from “owning or trading securities, commodities, futures, derivatives, options, or other similar financial assets, including where such investments are traded through an investment vehicle that the covered person controls.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also calls for covered individuals to divest their investments, place them in a Qualified Blind Trust, or move them to diversified mutual or exchange-traded funds, U.S. Treasury bills, notes or bonds.</p>\n\n\n\nNew lawmakers sworn in; vote on Queen Elizabeth II resolution\n\n\n\n<p>The House on Tuesday is scheduled to swear in three new lawmakers who secured seats in Congress in recent special elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First on the list is former Alaska state Rep. Mary Peltola, who won a special election in Alaska last month to finish the late-Rep. Don Young’s (R-Alaska) term in the House. Young, who was the Dean of the House — a title given to the longest-serving member of Congress — died in March at the age of 88.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peltola flipped the longtime Republican-held seat in an upset victory, besting former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) and others in the ranked-choice system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peltola is now the first Alaska Native to win a congressional election and she will be the first woman to represent Alaska’s single House seat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democrat Pat Ryan, who won a special election in New York’s 19th Congressional District last month, is also slated to be sworn in on Tuesday. Ryan is replacing former Rep. Antonio Delgado (D-N.Y.), who resigned from the House in May to become lieutenant governor of the Empire State.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan beat Republican Marc Molinaro in the swing-district race that many saw as a bellwether for how the midterm elections will shake out in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third on the swearing-in list is Joe Sempolinski, a Republican who won a special election in New York’s 23rd Congressional District last month to finish former Rep. Tom Reed’s (R-N.Y.) term. Reed resigned from Congress in May, which was more than a year after a former lobbyist accused him of sexual misconduct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sempolinski defeated Democrat Max Della Pia for the seat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also on Tuesday, the House is slated to pass a bereavement resolution to honor Queen Elizabeth II, who died on Thursday at the age of 96, according to Pelosi spokesperson Drew Hammill. The House will then adjourn for the day.</p>",

        "description": "<p>President Biden on Monday will announce the director of a new agency focused on biomedical innovation and sign an executive order on biotechnologies as part of an update on his administration’s efforts to cure cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden will travel to Boston on the 60th anniversary of former President John F. Kennedy’s “Moonshot” speech at Rice University, where Kennedy outlined his goal for the United States to land a man on the moon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The president will provide an update on his administration’s “Cancer Moonshot,” an initiative he relaunched in February with the goal to cut the cancer death rate in half over the next 25 years and improve the lives of caregivers and cancer survivors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden on Monday will announce the appointment of Dr. Renee Wegrzyn as the inaugural director of Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), an agency created in March focused on developing biomedical technologies to improve health outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The president will also sign an executive order launching a national biotechnology and biomanufacturing initiative. The order will bolster research and aim to solidify supply chains so that biotechnologies used in the fight against cancer are developed and produced in the U.S., according to a White House fact sheet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This initiative is rooted in the principles of equity, ethics, safety, and security that will help benefit all Americans and the global community, and maintain United States technological leadership and economic competitiveness,” the White House said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden will also give an update on the progress of his “Cancer Cabinet,” a group of advisers and administration officials tasked with securing funding and developing treatments for cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The president will highlight recent developments like the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act by Democrats in Congress, which includes provisions to lower prescription drug costs, some of which are used to treat certain forms of cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He will also note the launch of a National Cancer Institute study aimed at identifying blood tests that can detect one or more cancers with the goal of earlier detection in cancer patients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the speech on Monday, Biden will make remarks on the investments in the bipartisan infrastructure law in Boston.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cause of ending cancer has been personal for Biden, whose son, Beau, died of brain cancer in 2015 at the age of 46. The president has talked about ending cancer throughout his campaign and presidency, saying it would be a priority for him. He has also framed it as a bipartisan effort, meeting with members of both parties at the White House last year to discuss the effort.</p>",

I have extra,\" she tells three other teachers, who like her have traveled here from the Philippines to instruct students in math, science, social studies and language arts. </p><p>“It's a big opportunity for us to be here as teachers,” said Santillan, as she readied her classroom for a new year and a new crop of third graders. She has ten years of teaching experience, but this is her first time teaching in the U.S. </p><p>It wasn’t an easy decision to come to Willmar. Santillan was worried that she would feel lost once she arrived. But she says district administrators and community members have given her a warm welcome.</p>Shelamie Santillan organizes books inside of her classroom at Roosevelt Elementary School in Willmar, Minn. Having come from the Philippines, Santillan was one of the newest hires for the school district.Hannah Yang | MPR News<p>“People here are doing their best to help us to be oriented, familiarized,” she said. “They always ask what do you need guys? Do you have groceries? They take us everywhere.” </p><p>Almera Jane Amindato, will teach fourth grade at nearby Kennedy Elementary. She reviewed the new curriculum she will be teaching and says it doesn't strike her as all that different from what she taught in the Philippines.</p><p>\"It's just that we have to learn more on technology because in the Philippines, we do not own an iPad, we just use our blackboard,\" said Amindato.  </p>Almera Jane Amindato, a new teacher in Willmar Public Schools, poses for a photo.Hannah Yang | MPR News<p>This is the first time that Willmar Public Schools has tapped teachers from other countries to fill vacant positions.</p><p>When administrators couldn't find enough teachers locally, the district reached out to the International Teach Alliance program, which helps schools find credentialed teachers from other countries who want to work in the U.S. </p><p>Candidates were interviewed by Zoom and Willmar school officials filled five teacher vacancies. Another teacher from Nicaragua is expected to join the group in Willmar soon, once his visa arrives.</p><p>\"And I certainly look at it that if we didn't have them here, if they didn't accept these jobs, we would have five more openings right now,\" said Elizabeth Windingstad, the district’s human resources director.</p><p>The new teachers are in the U.S. on J-1 visas that allow them to participate in work and study based exchange programs. They can teach here for up to five years. Then they must return home for two years before they can apply to teach in the U.S. again. Data from the U.S. Department of State shows there were 26 educators in Minnesota last year teaching on a J-1 visa. </p>A group of new teachers from the Philippines are going over some forms with Roosevelt Elementary School Principal Lori Lockhart. Willmar Public Schools hired several new teachers through a program that connects credentialed instructors from around the world to teach in the United States.Hannah Yang | MPR News<p>\"This is a somewhat unique and creative way to address a need,” said Jeff Holm, superintendent for Willmar Public Schools. “I'm hoping we can find other creative means and be thinking ahead.\"</p><p>Four decades ago, when Holm started teaching, he said there were lots of candidates competing for open teaching positions. </p><p>\"Things have changed,” he said. “And we need to figure out ways to try and stay ahead of the curve as best we can.\"</p><p>Like Willmar, other school districts in Minnesota are also struggling to fill open staff positions. </p><p>The lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a drag on the supply of workers, said Deb Henton, executive director of the Minnesota Association of School Administrators. </p><p>\"I have heard from superintendents across the state, whether that be in the metro or greater Minnesota, that there are job openings that they are continuing to work to fill,\" she said. </p><p>Districts are trying a variety of tactics to attract more teachers from increasing pay and benefits to reducing class sizes. But those efforts take time to bear fruit and for communities like Willmar, the International Teach Alliance program helped the district fill an urgent staffing need. It also attracted a diverse group of educators to the community, said Windingstad. </p><p>\"They're interested in doing community education classes and sharing some of their cooking experiences. I'm learning so much from them,” she said. “I truly hope if [the program is] a success, that we'll be able to continue this going forward.\" </p>Missi May Flores, a new third grade teacher at Roosevelt Elementary School in Willmar Public Schools, decorates a blackboard in her classroom for the new school year.Hannah Yang | MPR News<p>Since arriving in Minnesota a few weeks ago, Missi May Flores, a new third grade teacher at Roosevelt Elementary, says she is already feeling at home. </p><p>\"We love the place. It's peaceful and quiet and we are loving the welcoming people here in Willmar,” she said.  </p><p>Flores looks forward to sharing more about her culture with students and staff. She thinks the experience will be good for her — and her students. </p><p>\"I would like to be part of a program that will support children who will be aware of cultural differences, and that will equip them to be more effective global citizens,\" said Flores.</p><p>The group has already taken in the Minnesota State Fair, and they hope to visit an apple orchard this fall and even try ice fishing. But they are a little worried about Minnesota's cold winters.</p><p>\"We're scared. And we're always joking, we're going to die,\" said Flores. </p><p>MPR News reporter Elizabeth Shockman contributed to this report. </p><p>Correction (Sept. 12, 2022): A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the grade level that Almera Jane Amindato teaches. It also incorrectly stated the last name of the district's human resources director.

        "description": "Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Injury updates for Rizzo, Bader, Castro, Chapman, and Britton; LeMahieu looks to be at “full strength” when he returns; Yankee Stadium ranked among the league’s best bullpens</p> <p>MLB Trade Rumors | Darragh McDonald: The injury bug has been hitting the Yankees fairly hard of late, as they currently have 15 players on the injured list. Not surprisingly, the injury report at this time is fairly long. Anthony Rizzo, who has missed time with a back problem and then headaches that may have resulted from the epidural given to treat the back problem, is currently pain-free and preparing to ramp back up. His return will give the Yankees a boost at first, as Marwin Gonzalez has been holding down the position with Oswaldo Cabrera serving as the backup. Outfielder Harrison Bader made his Yankees organization debut yesterday afternoon with a rehab outing with Double-A Somerset; also appearing in that game were a trio of relievers — Zack Britton, Miguel Castro, and Aroldis Chapman. Lastly, Luis Severino may require one more rehab outing before returning to the Yankees rotation.</p>\n<p>New York Post | Greg Joyce: Notably absent from the list of injured players working their way back is infielder DJ LeMahieu, who is currently shelved with a toe injury. While he hopes to be ready for the Yankees’ next homestand, which begins on September 20th, LeMahieu has said that he will not be back until he’s “pretty close to full strength,” revealing that the injury prevented him from rotating his back foot and acknowledging that the injury made him “not [himself].”</p>\n<p>The Denver Post | Tribune News Service: What relievers do when they’re not warming up or pitching in the game has drawn the attention of writers this year. Back in July, Emma Baccellieri investigated the sprint in from the bullpen when a benches-clearing brawl goes down. Now, somebody — I’m not quite sure who, as I have only found this article with “Tribune News Service” in the byline — has finally dared to ask the question: “What makes a good bullpen? And which ones are good?” While I won’t spoil the entire story, I will note that the Yankee Stadium bullpens are universally loved, while the Fenway and Tampa Bay bullpens aren’t.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Fightin’ Joe Biden has had enough.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so have the majority of Americans — me included.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not the hard-right echo chamber. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They say the president is divisive for calling out MAGA extremists, semi-fascists and people who are “entitled to be an idiot.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They say Biden is demonizing the 74 million people who voted against him in the last presidential election.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They say Biden is the real authoritarian — trying to shut down legitimate criticism. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is pure spin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a cheap attempt to have every Trump voter feel that they’re required to defend all Trump voters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be a member of the club, they must stand by the roughly 25 percent of GOP voters who believe in the twisted QAnon conspiracy.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They must make excuses for the violent Trump supporters who shut down the Capitol. That means ignoring even those who threatened to hang former Vice President Pence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It means not talking about Trump’s recent suggestion of “full pardons with an apology” for many of the people convicted for their actions on Jan. 6, 2021.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, it is an article of faith for much of today’s GOP to believe the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. Polls show about 70 percent of Republicans join the chorus singing the fiction that voter fraud led to Biden’s victory, and that he is a phony in the White House.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also must dismiss the danger of Trump taking classified documents to Mar-a-Lago. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden rightly called out all this spinning, gaslighting and outright lying as a threat to democracy during his recent speech in Philadelphia.  He took care to show respect to conservative Republicans who didn’t vote for him but refuse to go along with the Trump extremists. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology. I know because I’ve been able to work with these mainstream Republicans,” he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s where Joe went off-track. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the rub. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of the extremism is fueled by self-described moderate Republicans making feeble excuses for bad behavior.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Too many of these moderate Republicans are choosing to play dumb. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden got back on track when he said too many of these tongue-tied moderates support a party “dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and that is a threat to this country.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden described the immediate consequence: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They’re working right now, as I speak, in state after state to give power to decide elections in America to partisans and cronies, empowering election deniers to undermine democracy itself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> “These are hard things. But I’m an American president…And I believe it is my duty — my duty to level with you, to tell the truth no matter how difficult, no matter how painful.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Some Republican moderates are daring to stand apart by signing an extraordinary letter published last week.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eight former Secretaries of Defense and five former leaders of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — several of whom served during Republican administrations — warned of an “extreme strain” between the military and civilians. They did not name Trump but they left no doubt about the cost his lies have exacted.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Politically, military professionals confront an extremely adverse environment characterized by the divisiveness of affective polarization that culminated in the first election in over a century when the peaceful transfer of political power was disrupted and in doubt,” says the letter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, an NBC News poll taken last month found that 21 percent of voters ranked “threats to democracy” as the most important issue facing the country. “Cost of living” ranked second with 16 percent.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Philadelphia speech was the most important of Biden’s presidency. Progressives have been urging him to call out the existential threat to democracy posed by Trump and the MAGA Republicans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is finally naming it and shaming it. And he is right to do so.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was as important as any speech made by any American president in my lifetime. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet somehow the major broadcast networks didn’t carry it live. They said it was political.  If the Gettysburg Address or the ‘I Have a Dream’ speech were given in the age of social media, they too would be wrongly labeled as political.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some newspapers aren’t doing much better. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Trump, in the days before Biden’s speech, bizarrely called for a re-do of the 2020 election, it made few headlines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, in this column, I called out “Trump’s use of a witches’ brew of outright lies and distortion to hold the support of at least one-third of Americans.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, the brew has only gotten more corrosive. But somehow too many editors want to be polite, perhaps fearing warnings of violence most recently voiced by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon, the January 6 Commission will continue its public hearings meticulously detailing the extent of the Trump-led conspiracy to overturn the election. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden is right to use his bully pulpit to sound the alarm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The preservation of democracy is the defining issue of the 2022 campaign. This election is a referendum on MAGA Republicans.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>November 8 is a day for moderates and true Republican conservatives to open their eyes to the extremist threat to American democracy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fight on, Mr. President. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan Williams is an author, and a political analyst for Fox News Channel. </p>",

        "description": "Sunflowers growing amongst the weeds on Amsterdam Avenue, by Carol Brewer.\n<p>By Carol Tannenhauser</p>\n<p>Monday, September 12, 2022\nCloudy. A stray shower or thunderstorm is possible, high 83 degrees.</p>\n<p>Notices\nOur calendar has lots of local events! Click on the link or the lady in the upper righthand corner.</p>\n<p>Last month, we introduced a new feature called West Side Mews: Cat Stories, written by Victoria Cumings, profiling UWS cats. Anyone who wants their kitty or kitties featured, contact Victoria at victoria@westsidemews.com. “I saw from the comments that Freyja, Pistachio, Catarina, Jamie McFluff, and Crowley may like to be featured,” Victoria wrote. “I’ll aim to do a West Side Mews story every two weeks.”</p>\n<p>If you’re following the ressurection of the Metro Theater (Broadway, 99-100), there is a public hearing on Zoom on Wednesday, September 14, at 6:30 pm, at which the prospective operators will make their case for obtaining a liqour license. Here’s the link to register for the Zoom: https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_-XbJJB7PT2Cfb6OgMoSp8A </p>\n<p>The Health Department monitors mosquito populations and applies pesticides during the summer to reduce the number of mosquitoes and lessen the risk of mosquito-borne diseases, such as West Nile Virus. In August, DOH announced that there were a record number of NYC mosquitos infected with WNV, and two cases of the disease, one each in Brooklyn and Queens. There will be a pesticide spraying of a large swath of Manhattan, including the Upper West Side, on Thursday, September 15, starting at 8:30pm and continuing until 6am, September 16 (rain date: September 19). “No reported diseases in people or pets have been linked with the use of pesticides in West Nile virus control efforts since 1999,” DOH reported. “People who are sensitive to spray ingredients may get a rash or have short-term eye or throat irritation. If you have a stronger reaction to pesticides, call the NYC Poison Control Center at 212-POISONS (212-764-7667). For more information about avoiding pesticide exposure, click here.

Must be people and staircase friendly and able to stand for 30-45 minutes at a time, but the movie’s free! If you’re interested in learning more, send an email to: contact@newplazacinema.org.</p>\n<p>News\nNo more lox! Rabbi Shuli Passow, the director of community engagement at B’nai Jeshurun (West 88th Street between Broadway and West End Avenue) announced on their website last Thursday that there will be no more lox at the synagogue’s Community Kiddush lunches following Saturday Shabbat services. “What we eat and how we eat it should intentionally express our values,” she wrote. “Lox will be eliminated from the menu so we can do our part to reduce the environmental impact of pollution and overfishing. We know that for some this is a heretical move! We are here to support you as you process this change.”</p>\n<p>“A new exhibition honoring Black lives lost to racial injustice in the United States will open this month in New York City’s historical Seneca Village, once home to a thriving black community that was displaced by the city to make way for Central Park in the 1850s,” 6sqft reported. “Presented by the San Diego African American Museum of Fine Art (SDAAMFA), the Say Their Names Memorial Exhibition is a month-long augmented reality experience debuting on Saturday, September 17 at West 85th Street in Central Park.” For more information, click here.</p>\n<p>Finally, out of left field, you don’t have to be perfect at work, according to none less than The Economist. “[P]erfectionism is increasingly out of step with the ways that products are developed, employees are treated and workforces are organized,” they wrote. One reason is that the trait is on the rise and it’s not good for your mental health. “A study published in 2017 found that [perfectionism] had been steadily increasing among American, British and Canadian college students between 1989 and 2016 (before you blame Instagram, one big reason is rising parental expectations). The tyranny of excessively high expectations is not good for you: a big literature review in 2016 concluded that perfectionism is associated with a string of mental-health disorders, from depression and burnout to stress and self-harm.”</p>\n<p>The above does not apply to WSR writers who answer to a higher power: WSR commenters.</p>\n<p>Have a great week!</p>",

Delaware … not so much.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>REUTERS / Brian Snyder</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We made it! After six months of voting — remember Texas? — Tuesday marks the final primary day of the 2022 election cycle, with New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Delaware all set to choose their party nominees.1 And while these states are some of the nation’s smallest in both land area and population, New Hampshire and Rhode Island are making up for their size by hosting five big primaries that could have repercussions for control of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, as well as decide the next governor of Rhode Island. (Sorry, Delaware, there’s just not much happening in the First State.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans’ choice of who should face Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan this fall seems to have narrowed to either retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc or state Senate President Chuck Morse. <p>Kristopher Radder / The Brattleboro Reformer / AP</p>New Hampshire\n\n\n\n<p>Races to watch: U.S. Senate; 1st and 2nd congressional districts</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polls close: 7 p.m. Eastern in most of the state, 8 p.m. in some localities</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the action in New Hampshire is on the Republican side, and the most closely watched race is undoubtedly the one for Senate. Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan could be vulnerable in purple New Hampshire, which is roughly 1 percentage point more Democratic than the country as a whole, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean index.2 </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early polls suggested Republican Gov. Chris Sununu could have seriously threatened Hassan, but to the chagrin of national Republican leaders, he announced late last year that he would not run for the Senate and would instead seek reelection. As a result, the Senate race attracted a crowded field of less-notable Republican contenders that has since turned into a two-man race between retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc and state Senate President Chuck Morse. The candidates differ markedly, too: Bolduc is known as a “loose cannon” who has promoted former President Donald Trump’s false claim that the 2020 election was stolen, while Morse is a longtime public official who has highlighted his experience on the campaign trail. Sununu, who last month labeled Bolduc as a “conspiracy-theory type” candidate, made a splash on Sept. 8 when he endorsed Morse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while Bolduc lost in the 2020 GOP Senate primary, limited primary polling shows him to be the front-runner this time. A poll released on Sept. 9 by Democratic pollster Public Policy Polling found Bolduc ahead of Morse by 10 points, 33 percent to 23 percent, but with 25 percent undecided. PPP’s survey showed a closer race than a late-August poll from the University of New Hampshire Survey Center that found Bolduc leading Morse 43 percent to 22 percent and an early-August poll from Saint Anselm College Survey Center that found Bolduc up 32 percent to 16 percent. And while Bolduc led in each poll, Morse has a major fundraising edge that could help him close that gap. As of Aug. 24, Morse had raised $1.6 million to Bolduc’s $579,000, and the state-legislative leader also had almost seven times as much money for the final stretch of the campaign, $582,000 to Bolduc’s $84,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside groups have also spent millions as the parties jockey to help their chances in November. A super PAC backed by national Republicans has helped Morse by spending $4.6 million portraying him as “one tough conservative” who’ll fight for border security, and calling Bolduc’s ideas “crazy” by highlighting some of his controversial past statements, including calling Sununu a “Chinese Communist sympathizer.” But Senate Majority PAC, the Democrats’ principal outside group, has spent $3.1 million attacking Morse as a “sleazy politician” who is Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s choice in the race. These ads haven’t mentioned Bolduc, but they’ve hit Morse for taking money from lobbyists, including one with connections to the Chinese Communist Party and another group that lobbied for pharmaceutical companies amid the opioid epidemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hassan awaits the Republican primary winner, and FiveThirtyEight’s 2022 midterm election forecast currently gives her a clear edge. But her advantage will depend on who wins, as polling suggests Morse would give Hassan a more competitive race than Bolduc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans may have a better chance of flipping the 1st District, an R+1 seat covering eastern New Hampshire held by two-term Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas. Had Republicans in the state legislature gotten their way, this seat would have become more clearly GOP-leaning, but Sununu’s lack of support for it led to a map that made both of New Hampshire’s seats highly competitive.</p>\n\n\n\nGail Huff Brown and Matt Mowers debated earlier this month, and while both are hoping to secure the Republican nomination for New Hampshire’s 1st District, Mowers is in a much better position than Huff Brown. <p>AP Photo / Mary Schwalm</p><p>The two leading Republican contenders in this district appear to be former Trump White House adviser Matt Mowers and former White House press aide Karoline Leavitt, but also in the race are former TV reporter Gail Huff Brown, whose husband is former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown (who also had a failed Senate bid in New Hampshire in 2014), and state Rep. Tim Baxter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mowers has led in polls from independent outlets, but his margin has varied from the double digits to well within the margin of error. Most recently, the late-August UNH poll found him ahead of Leavitt only 26 percent to 24 percent, similar to Saint Anselm College’s poll from earlier in August, which found Mowers leading Leavitt 25 percent to 21 percent. By comparison, though, a mid-August co/efficient poll for NH Journal found Mowers ahead of Leavitt 31 percent to 16 percent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, recent polls on behalf of the campaigns or their outside allies have either given Mowers a bigger lead or shown Leavitt running even with Mowers. For the most part, Huff Brown and Baxter have polled in the high single digits, although the UNH poll did find Huff Brown at 16 percent.</p>\n\n\n\nAlso running in the Republican primary for New Hampshire’s 1st District, Karoline Leavitt has embraced the more combative language of politicians like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.<p>Interestingly, this race has sparked divisions within the House GOP’s leadership. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise have backed Mowers, while GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik has endorsed Leavitt, her former press secretary. This split is particularly revealing when it comes to the candidates’ presentation and tone. Although Mowers and Leavitt are both supporters of Trump and touch on leading conservative concerns, Mowers has said President Biden got the most votes, even though Mowers has also called for audits, while Leavitt has fully denied the outcome of the 2020 election. Mowers has also run ads that look ahead to the general election and attack Pappas and Biden for inflation and wasteful spending, while Leavitt has embraced the more combative language of the right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Mowers’s outside backers have more monetary muscle, which could put Mowers over the top, especially because he and Leavitt have run pretty even in campaign fundraising. The Congressional Leadership Fund, the House GOP’s main outside arm, has spent $1.3 million boosting Mowers, promoting him as a conservative who will secure the border and halt the trafficking of opioids. Meanwhile, Defending Main Street, which backs more moderate Republican candidates, has spent nearly $1.3 million attacking Leavitt, who is 25 years old, as a “woke Gen-Zer” who has mooched off her parents. For her part, Leavitt has received $204,000 in support from Truth &amp; Courage PAC, a group connected to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, while New Hampshire Principles PAC has spent $437,000 attacking Mowers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next door, in the 2nd District, a D+2 seat, Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster is seeking her sixth term, and she’ll probably face either Keene Mayor George Hansel or former Hillsborough County Treasurer Robert Burns. Polling here has found a large share of undecided voters, but the UNH poll gave Burns a 14-point lead over Hansel, 32 percent to 18 percent, while Saint Anselm College’s survey found them both at around 10 percent.</p>\n\n\n\nIn the Republican primary for New Hampshire’s 2nd District, voters are once more choosing how far to the right to go, with George Hansel (left) in the more moderate lane and Robert Burns (right) in the diehard Trump lane. <p>AP Photo / Mary Schwalm</p><p>On paper, Hansel looks like a stronger general-election candidate than Burns. Hansel just jumped in the race three months ago, but he has already raised $377,000. He also identifies as “pro-choice” on abortion, which could help him in a state that isn’t super religious and has a lot of independents. Finally, Hansel’s ads have gone after Kuster on inflation, opioid trafficking and home heating bills, which may play more to a general-election audience. But Burns may have the inside track with GOP primary voters, despite having raised about half what Hansel has. He’s highlighted his “pro-life” stance on abortion and pro-Trump views. He’s also attacked Hansel as a “liberal, woke mayor.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democrats have noticed that Burns might be the weaker general-election choice, too, and have meddled accordingly. Democrats Serve, which typically supports Democratic candidates with public-service backgrounds, has spent $561,000 ostensibly attacking Burns as an “unapologetic conservative,” an approach used by Democrats elsewhere this cycle to help more right-leaning candidates win in the GOP primaries. But Hansel has received $664,000 in outside support from American Liberty Action, which has spent large sums in other Republican primaries this cycle to take down strongly pro-Trump candidates. We’ll find out on Tuesday which party got what it wanted.</p>\n\n\n\n\nIn the Democratic primary for governor of Rhode Island, incumbent Dan McKee (second from right) should be a shoo-in, but he faces an unexpectedly competitive and crowded field. <p>AP Photo / David Goldman</p>Rhode Island\n\n\n\n<p>Races to watch: governor; 2nd Congressional District</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polls close: 8 p.m. Eastern</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big-ticket race in Rhode Island is the primary for governor, where Democratic Gov. Dan McKee is seeking a full term after succeeding to the office as lieutenant governor following then-Gov. Gina Raimondo’s appointment to Biden’s Cabinet in 2021. But McKee is not the presumptive nominee; he’s now caught up in a mostly three-way primary with Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea and former CVS Health executive Helena Foulkes, although former Secretary of State Matt Brown is also in the mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The polls suggest it’s a wide-open contest, too. Most recently, an early August poll from Fleming &amp; Associates/WPRI/Roger Williams University found McKee at 28 percent and Gorbea at 25 percent. Yet, a June survey from Suffolk University/The Boston Globe put Gorbea slightly ahead of McKee, 24 percent to 20 percent, similar to the results of a late-July survey conducted for Gorbea’s campaign by Lake Research Partners that found her leading McKee 27 percent to 22 percent. In each of these polls, Foulkes was in the mid-teens while Brown was down in the single digits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>McKee isn’t benefiting much from incumbency, which isn’t actually that shocking: Historically, incumbent governors who ascended to the governorship because of resignation or death have been more likely to lose renomination than elected ones. McKee also has his own vulnerabilities, particularly an ongoing federal investigation into whether his administration improperly awarded a multimillion-dollar contract to a firm connected to a longtime McKee ally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More broadly, though, McKee isn’t very popular: In the second quarter of 2022, Morning Consult found that more voters disapproved of him (43 percent) than approved (38 percent). Still, McKee has tried to play up his accomplishments, such as ending the annual tax on motor vehicles, investing in affordable housing and raising the minimum age to purchase a gun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for McKee’s main challengers, Gorbea wants to raise corporate taxes to fund social programs and help small businesses, and she’s highlighted her experience in housing development and running Rhode Island’s elections. She could also become the first Latina to be elected governor in New England. But Gorbea landed in hot water last month, when her campaign cited a conservative commentator in an ad attacking McKee, drawing liberal criticism and prompting McKee’s campaign to call her “desperate.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foulkes, meanwhile, has led the money race with $3.9 million in spending since last year (helped out by $1.3 million in self-funding), compared with McKee’s $2 million and Gorbea’s $1.8 million. Foulkes has tried to portray herself as an outsider who can get “big things done,” and she’s promised not to run for reelection if children’s education levels haven’t improved after her first term. Regardless of who wins, the Democratic primary winner will enter the general election as a favorite, with health-care executive Ashley Kalus looking to be the likely GOP nominee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other race of note in Rhode Island is the Democratic primary in the 2nd District, a D+16 seat in the western part of the state. Longtime Democratic Rep. Jim Langevin is retiring, leaving this seat open. Rhode Island General Treasurer Seth Magaziner looks like the favorite in the Democratic primary, but he still has to fend off opposition from former Commerce Department lawyer Sarah Morgenthau and former state Rep. David Segal.</p>\n\n\n\nRhode Island General Treasurer Seth Magaziner is the favorite in the Democratic primary for the state’s 2nd Congressional District. Not only is he leading in fundraising, but he also landed the endorsement of the district’s retiring incumbent.<p>Magaziner started out running for governor but switched races following Langevin’s retirement, and he’s built up a major fundraising edge since then. He’s raised $2.4 million, far outpacing Morgenthau ($978,000) and Segal ($528,000), and he has also attracted $562,000 in outside support compared with none for his primary opponents. Magaziner has also earned endorsements from Langevin and the state party, and he’s played up his opposition to Trump and his intention to protect abortion rights and Social Security. But Morgenthau has sought to break through by arguing that, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, it’s time for Rhode Island to send a Democratic woman to Congress for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, the winner of this primary should be very likely to win in November, but former Cranston Mayor Allan Fung is hoping to give Republicans a shot at winning here. Our forecast gives Democrats an edge, but it’s also the bluest district in the entire country to only “lean” toward Democrats, so there’ll be plenty to watch here after the primary.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Please join us for our final primary live blog in 2022 on Tuesday starting at 7 p.m. Eastern. We’ll react to the results in New Hampshire and Rhode Island and talk about the contours of the upcoming general election now that we’re less than two months from November.</p>",

But now that their moment is here, they can’t agree about what to do with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest round of this drama just played out in the South Carolina Legislature, where Republicans spent two weeks debating a full ban on abortion in the state — only to deadlock on the details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A full ban didn’t seem like it would be an especially hard sell, at least in theory. South Carolina is a red state, with a partisan lean of R+18.6. And when the bill was introduced, most Republicans in the conservative legislature, where they outnumber Democrats nearly 2-to-1, seemed to support the general concept of banning abortion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they quickly splintered over the details. A group of Republicans introduced a bill that banned abortion without exceptions for rape, incest and lethal fetal abnormalities, but that failed after a day of pleading and accusations on the House floor. A bill with a limited set of exceptions passed the House, but those exceptions were then stripped out of the bill as soon as it landed in the state Senate. Just like that, back to square one. Late Thursday night, Senate Republicans still couldn’t agree on what form the bill should take. After a Republican briefly filibustered the full ban, the Senate settled on adding more restrictions to the state’s six-week abortion ban, which is temporarily blocked by the state Supreme Court, and sent the bill back to the House.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This stalemate reflects the broader conundrum facing Republican lawmakers now that the Supreme Court is no longer stopping them from outlawing abortion. The highly restrictive laws that anti-abortion advocates want to pass are forcing messy — and public — conversations about just how restrictive to be. Are any exceptions — like those for rape and incest — acceptable? And how should Republicans weigh the broader political backlash against abortion bans, which has reshaped the landscape of the midterm elections?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, Republicans are bitterly divided over whether to push forward with the kinds of laws that passed before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. According to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of every pre-viability abortion ban, preexisting bans very rarely included exceptions for circumstances like rape and incest. But now, more Republicans want to back away from a highly unpopular approach — sparking accusations from fellow party members that they are pro-life in name only. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we examined the text of each law banning abortion before 20 weeks of pregnancy3 that is currently in effect or being fought in the courts, we found that 17 of the 23 states with a pre-20 week ban have no exceptions for rape and incest, and five of the states have only partial exceptions, limiting how far along in a pregnancy an abortion can be obtained, requiring victims of rape and incest to file a police report — or both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the calculus may be changing. Gil Gatch, a South Carolina Republican legislator who opposes abortion but advocated for exceptions to rape and incest during the recent legislative debate, told FiveThirtyEight that, before the Dobbs ruling, abortion bans before 20 weeks were mostly a matter of rhetoric, as Supreme Court precedent meant they were all but guaranteed not to go into effect. Now, not so much. “It’s much more difficult — to be honest, it’s scarier — because if we get the wrong thing done, it’s on us,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Carolina Republican lawmakers aren’t the first to fracture over how far abortion bans should go. In August, more than half of the Republicans in the Indiana House of Representatives voted to remove rape and incest exceptions from the near-total ban they were considering. (The law eventually passed with limited rape and incest exceptions and will go into effect on Sept. 15.) The same month, the West Virginia Legislature deadlocked on its own sweeping abortion ban because Republicans couldn’t agree on the penalties for doctors, leaving the procedure legal in the state. (Part of the legislature will return next week, but it’s not clear whether the GOP has come to a consensus about the abortion bill.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar debates could unfold in other states like Ohio, Iowa and Nebraska, which have conservative legislatures but no law that fully bans abortion. Already, some red lines have become visible. Earlier this summer, Nebraska’s Republican governor announced that despite wanting to amend the state’s abortion laws he would not be calling a special session of the legislature because not enough state senators were willing to vote for a 12-week abortion ban.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Republicans, the question of whether rape and incest victims should be exempted from an abortion ban has turned into an especially raw divide. Some anti-abortion advocates and lawmakers think those exemptions simply don’t make sense. If abortion is morally wrong, why should an unborn fetus be killed because of the circumstances of its conception? Allowing a carveout for rape and incest would be “turning one tragedy into two,” said state Rep. John McCravy, as he introduced the bill in the South Carolina House. Before the Senate committee vote to remove rape and incest exceptions from the House bill, Republican Sen. Richard Cash compared abortion to slavery. “I don’t mean to be insensitive to anyone’s past, but is the human being in the womb nothing more than the property of the woman?” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some anti-abortion lawmakers and advocates see this as a kind of test — a way to see who isn’t espousing pro-life principles just for the sake of politics. “I was elected for what my constituents want, and the majority of them are telling me, just like I believe, that life begins at conception. So no, I’m not for exceptions,” Rep. Melissa Oremus, another South Carolina Republican, told FiveThirtyEight. The challenge, she said, is that even Republicans were surprised by the Supreme Court’s ruling. “We never thought we’d see Roe overturned in our day,” she said. “So now [that] you have the ability, what are you going to do about that?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That position — while ideologically consistent — is exceptionally unpopular. In poll after poll, large majorities of Americans have said that abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances. That includes many people who are opposed to abortion most of the time. A recent Pew Research Center poll conducted in March found that only 37 percent of abortion opponents wanted the procedure to be completely illegal in cases of rape. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other conservative lawmakers told me that they’re offended by the idea of making rape and incest exceptions into an anti-abortion litmus test. “I’m very much a conservative on this issue, but you have to acknowledge the fact that there are tragic and cruel circumstances where it’s presumptive, edging on hubris, to say that people can’t make their own decisions,” Rep. Micah Caskey, who proposed an amendment that would have created a limited exception for rape and incest victims who are minors, told FiveThirtyEight. “Yet there are purists who want to paint me as not pro-life for saying that,” he added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the first day of debate in the South Carolina Senate, all three Republican women in the chamber said they refused to vote for the bill if it didn’t contain rape and incest exceptions. “Are we simply baby machines? Are you pregnant with a dead baby? Too bad. Raped at 11 by your grandfather and got pregnant? That’s just too bad,” said Sen. Penry Gustafson, a Republican.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As they went back and forth about potential amendments, some South Carolina Republicans seemed a little shocked by the arguments they were having. Republican state Sen. Tom Davis, who ended up leading the filibuster against the bill, proposed another exception for fatal fetal abnormalities — a version of which appears in five other states’ abortion bans that are currently in effect or being litigated, according to our analysis — only to be accused of advocating for euthanasia by several other Republicans. “We have 170 legislators, mostly white men, saying to a woman that even though your doctor diagnoses your child with a congenital defect that isn’t compatible with life outside the womb, you have to carry that child to term,” he said. “Even though the child is going to be born dead! That doesn’t make any sense to me.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gulf between Republicans feels unbridgeable, even though the exceptions they’re arguing over are actually very small. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that advocates for abortion rights, only about 1 percent of women in 2004 sought abortions because of rape, and less than 1 percent sought abortions because of incest. Republicans are not fighting, for the most part, about whether abortion should be legal — they’re arguing over how to handle the tiny subset of cases that force an unpleasant choice between ideological purity and political reality. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But just as morality can shape politics, politics can also shape morality — and in South Carolina, several Republicans warned their colleagues that going too far on abortion could spur a massive backlash. “To those of you who feel that women are inferior, remember you were warned when you are challenged by a female,” said state Sen. Sandy Senn, a South Carolina Republican. “I think it’s going to be interesting to see what happens in the November elections. Because this issue is huge. You don’t think that women will vote single-issue on something like this? Because they will.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>One of the last Republican House primaries of the midterm cycle has emerged as a proxy battle between House GOP leaders and factions of the Republican party. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Candidates vying to face vulnerable Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District are jockeying over how Trumpy and conservative they are, as millions of outside dollars are being poured into the race and attacks have gotten personal in the run-up to the Tuesday primary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mowers, a former Trump appointee in the State Department, has the endorsement of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), as well as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His closest competition is Karoline Leavitt, a 25-year-old former press aide in the Trump White House and in House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik’s (R-N.Y.) congressional office, has endorsements from Stefanik, Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), as well as from Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Lee (R-Utah).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And she's proven to be a strong fundraiser, bringing in more than $1.5 million during the primary cycle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with McCarthy, has poured more than $1.5 million into the race to support Mowers with digital and television ads, direct mail, phone calls and text messages. Mowers himself has raised $1.7 million, slightly more than Leavitt. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leavitt has argued that her youth is a party-expanding asset. But well-funded forces are arguing that she is too young and inexperienced to flip the seat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Defending Main Street super PAC, part of a network of groups that supports more centrist Republican candidates, has pumped nearly $1.3 million into campaigning against Leavitt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A television ad released by the super PAC just before Labor Day billed her as \"immature and irresponsible,” featuring an old video of Leavitt saying, “Listen up, hoe bags,” before bursting into laughter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Republican Main Street Partnership PAC, another organization in the group’s network, endorsed Mowers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leavitt says the ad is a sign that the establishment is afraid of her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Voters are smart. The negative, desperate, disgusting smears that the establishment and these dirty money super PACs are waging against not only me, but my family, are completely backfiring,” Leavitt told The Hill in an interview. “Voters understand, thanks to President Trump, that when they are attacking you, it means you're over the target and you're winning.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mowers has also faced consistent attacks from his opponents, including in an ad from Leavitt focusing on the fact that he voted in both New Hampshire and New Jersey presidential primaries in 2016. The New Hampshire Attorney General’s office said that he did not violate the state’s law. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mowers faced Pappas as the Republican nominee for the seat in 2020, losing by 5 points. This year, after redistricting, the nonpartisan election handicappers at the Cook Political Report say the seat is more of a toss-up.Some internal and independent polls conducted last month showed Mowers with double-digit leads over Leavitt. But other surveys show a much more competitive race, with a late August poll from the University of New Hampshire finding Mowers leading at 26 percent and Leavitt at 24 percent support.Other candidates in the crowded race are also pumping their conservative credentials.Retired broadcast journalist Gail Huff Brown, wife of former Massachusetts U.S. Senator and New Zealand Ambassador under Trump Scott Brown, scored an endorsement from Fox News host Sean Hannity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>State Rep. Tim Baxter, another 25-year-old who is endorsed by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), slightly defended Leavitt from the Main Street ad while also knocking her for arguing that her youth is an asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I just don't think that people should be campaigning on identity politics. I think you're never too young or too old,” Baxter told The Hill, also knocking the outside spending. “People are sick of these politicians that are bought and paid for. The people of New Hampshire don't want a pawn for the swamp as the representative in D.C.”While different factions of the MAGA movement war with each other in the race, former President Trump himself has stayed silent. He endorsed Mowers in 2020. But that has not kept candidates from making him central to the race. Trump’s name repeatedly came up at a recent primary debate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leavitt leaned into Trump’s unproven claims about the 2020 election, saying in the debate that she believes it was stolen from Trump and that President Biden did not win 81 million votes.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"That's a preposterous claim,\" she said.The Mowers campaign went as far as to send out a mailer this week that pictured him alongside Trump, and featured the first part of Trump’s 2020 tweet in which he praised and endorsed Mowers — but cutting off the line about endorsements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Matt worked tirelessly with President Trump to secure the border, restore America’s energy independence and advance the America First agenda,” John Corbett, a spokesman for Matt Mowers, told The Hill in a statement. “In the days leading up to the primary, Matt is crisscrossing the district offering his solutions to fix the problems, like inflation and high gas prices, created by Joe Biden.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Leavitt had previously said she would vote for McCarthy for House Speaker if she gets to Congress and Republicans would take back the House, she appears to have soured on him after his PAC’s mass spending. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Kevin McCarthy and the establishment are spending millions and millions of dollars to buy the seat. So I won't be very inclined to help the establishment when I get down there,” Leavitt told The Hill. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Simmering tensions among congressional Democrats are rising to the surface as the party looks to secure a few more legislative victories in the final two-month sprint to the midterm elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both chambers have jam-packed agendas as they enter the final policy-making month before the November midterm elections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The House, which reconvenes on Tuesday, will not be in session in October so that lawmakers can head home to campaign — leaving little time for legislating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Senate, which reassembled last week, is scheduled to be in session for part of next month, though it is unlikely they will use the extra days in Washington.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the top of the agenda is legislation to prevent a government shutdown on Oct. 1. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Funding the government itself isn't splitting liberal and centrist Democrats, but there are likely to be divisions over how to get a bill through Congress.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) wants to include language in a stopgap government funding measure on permitting reform to make good on a deal he and other party leaders made with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to secure his support for passage of last month's Inflation Reduction Act. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But liberals in the House and in the Senate — including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — oppose the reforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I rise this morning to express my strong opposition to the so-called side deal that the fossil fuel industry is pushing to make it easier for them to pollute the environment and destroy our planet,” Sanders said on the Senate floor last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The permitting reform legislation is expected to expedite the development of fossil fuel and other energy products by setting maximum timelines for environmental reviews, among other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schumer promised Manchin that permitting reform would pass in exchange for his support of the multi-billion dollar climate, taxes and health care bill. Manchin’s backing was essential in helping Democrats secure enough support in the 50-50 Senate to trigger Vice President Kamala Harris’ tie-breaking vote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sanders called the permitting reform legislation “a huge giveaway to the fossil fuel industry,” and argued that the measure would sabotage Biden’s goal of halving carbon emissions by the year 2030.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Really, at a time when climate change is threatening the very existence of our planet, why would anybody be talking about substantially increasing carbon emissions and expanding fossil fuel production in the United States?” the Vermont Independent asked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The resistance does not end in the Senate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than House 70 Democrats penned a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) on Friday asking that the permitting reform legislation be omitted from the continuing resolution — a push against the side deal struck between Manchin and Schumer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The inclusion of these provisions in a continuing resolution, or any other must-pass legislation, would silence the voices of frontline and environmental justice communities by insulating them from scrutiny,” the lawmakers, led by Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Schumer goes through with his plan and tacks permitting reform onto the continuing resolution, and if that stopgap passes through the Senate, progressives in the House would be faced with a tough decision: vote \"no\" and potentially trigger a government shutdown, or ignore misgivings about the legislation and vote \"yes.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schumer could, however, play one more hand that would effectively force his colleagues on the left to support the measure despite their doubts: add a bill protecting marriage equality on the federal level to the continuing resolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the majority leader and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), a sponsor of the marriage equality bill, have both said they prefer to hold a separate vote on the legislation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tensions between liberals and centrists will also likely bubble up over other agenda items. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Centrist House Democrats are expected to push hard for a vote on policing legislation that has been delayed twice because of disagreements with House liberals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pelosi punted a vote on the public safety bills last month, writing in a letter to colleagues that “conversations continue on finding consensus for a robust public safety package.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liberals had opposed increases for police funding across the country given the outcry over violence by police against minority communities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But centrists running in tough races against the backdrop of Republicans decrying rising crime rates want to pass legislation that would provide more money for police. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The policing legislation was supposed to move in July with a bill to ban assault weapons, but Democratic leaders decided to separate the two measures to leave more time for consensus building. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it's far from clear that progress is being made. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the negotiations over policing bills continue, moderates — especially Democrats facing difficult reelection races in November, known as “Frontliners\" — are pushing for a vote to cinch a victory they can tout during the final weeks of campaigning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“President Biden said best in his State of the Union address: the answer is not to defund the police. The answer is to fund the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities,” one Frontliner told The Hill, speaking anonymously to talk about a sensitive topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This legislation has passed every test, except among the loud few, and does right by our communities to ensure safety and accountability. With our majority on the line, Democrats need to put their money where their mouths are and pass this bill before November,” they added.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3636537-gop-senators-led-by-graham-slam-trump-jan-6-pardon-promise/",
        "description": "<p>Former President Trump’s promise to grant pardons to the rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is running into strong opposition from Senate Republicans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of Trump’s closest allies, told The Hill that granting pardons to Jan. 6 protesters is “a bad idea.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Pardons are given to people who admit misconduct, rehabilitate themselves. They’re not supposed to be used for other purposes,” he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other Republican senators are joining Graham in criticizing Trump’s promise to pardon the Jan. 6 protesters as inappropriate.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t think potential candidates should hold pardons out as a promise,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), who is usually a reliable Trump ally. “It’s somewhat problematic for me on a moral level and an ethical level — sort of like promising other giveaways to particular individuals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I prefer avoiding those kinds of things,” he said.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said he wouldn’t support granting pardons to people convicted of crimes because of their actions on Jan. 6.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If he were elected, he would have a constitutional ability to do it,” he said of Trump’s promise of pardons. “I would disagree with it. I think there was insurrection and I think these folks need to be punished. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I was there. This was truly violent. People were injured, people were killed. I have very little mercy for the individuals that were involved in that activity that day,” Rounds added.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senate Republican Whip John Thune (S.D.) said people who committed crimes on Jan. 6 must face the consequences of their actions.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The only people that get pardoned are people who are charged with crimes. If they were charged with crimes, they ought to be prosecuted like everybody else,” he said. “The rule of law applies. If people broke laws, they need to be held accountable.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who voted last year to impeach Trump on the charge of inciting an insurrection on Jan. 6, said pardoning people who invaded the Capitol to stop Biden’s election would be wrong.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Jan. 6 riot was an attack on the temple of democracy, and the people who violated the law, attacked our law enforcement and besmirched our nation’s Capitol should be prosecuted according to the law, and certainly should not be pardoned,” he said. “It’s a grossly inappropriate comment to make.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not every Republican is quick to dismiss the idea of a pardon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) who raised a fist to protestors outside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, before he and other members of Congress were evacuated during the insurrection, is more open to the idea of granting leniency to pro-Trump protesters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Let’s see which ones he would choose to do,” Hawley said of the prospect of Trump pardoning Jan. 6 protesters if he wins another term in the White House. “There’s no question it has been a massive prosecutorial effort.“</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who both led objections to the Electoral College tally in January 2021, argue the Department of Justice (DOJ) is punishing Trump supporters who entered the Capitol on Jan. 6 much more aggressively than the rioters who destroyed property at Black Lives Matter demonstrations in 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think that the folks who committed crimes, particularly violent crimes, on that day ought to be prosecuted,” Hawley said of the Jan. 6 protesters who have been sentenced to prison. “I think the question becomes, are there are people who’ve been caught up in this drag net who, for instance, didn’t know that they were trespassing?“  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There’s a lot of concern about, frankly, the double standard at [the Department of Justice] going after people who may have at most trespassed on federal property and not even known they did it versus folks who have in [Black Lives Matter] riots committed violent crimes and not been prosecuted,” he added, referring to the failure to prosecute people who destroyed property at riots in the wake of George Floyd’s death at the hands of police.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There absolutely is undeniably a double standard,” he said.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hawley said the Department of Justice has filed briefs asking for leniency for Black Lives Matter protesters who destroyed property or caused injuries because their actions were motivated by a desire for social justice, while federal prosecutors have sought maximum penalties for Trump supporters who entered the Capitol last year.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Federal prosecutors, for example, asked for an 18-month prison sentence for Richard Michetti, who was arrested after his ex-girlfriend turned him in to law enforcement.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michetti was charged with aiding and abetting obstruction of an official proceeding after entering and remaining in the Capitol for 45 minutes on Jan. 6, where he yelled obscenities at police officers. He was sentenced last week to 24 months of supervised release and ordered to pay a $2,000 penalty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A study published by Time magazine in June found that 840 people had been charged with storming the Capitol on that day and that about a quarter of them have received criminal sentences, with a median prison sentence of 45 days.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump told conservative radio host Wendy Bell on Sept. 1 that he would issue full pardons and apologize to many of his supporters who were prosecuted for their actions on Jan. 6.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I mean full pardons with an apology to many,” he said earlier this month.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cruz said there’s a big difference between protesters who attacked Capitol police officers and smashed the Capitol’s windows and doorways and Trump supporters who showed up at the Capitol to voice their opposition to certifying Biden as president.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think there is a stark difference between acts of violence and peaceful protest. Acts of violence are unacceptable from any political perspective. Peaceful protest is protected by the first amendment of the Constitution,” Cruz said when asked about Trump’s promise to pardon many Jan. 6 protesters.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Biden Justice Department has used Jan. 6 and the violent acts of a few to justify persecuting the peaceful protest and political speech of the many,” he said. “It is wildly inconsistent.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Department of Justice turns a blind eye to violent rioters who looted, destroyed and firebombed American cities across the country but is eager to target anyone who dares speak on the other side of the aisle,” he said, citing Biden’s recent speech in Philadelphia, where he accused Trump and his allies of pushing a form of political extremism that “threatens the very foundations of our republic.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This past week it got so bad that Joe Biden, bathed in red light, decreed that half the nation are fascists because they dare to disagree with his socialist policies,” Cruz said. “What DOJ is doing, targeting the political enemies of the White House, is corrupt and incredibly harmful.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked if people who illegally entered the Capitol on Jan. 6 should receive pardons if they didn’t assault officers or destroy property, Cruz would only say “acts of violence are qualitatively different.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A study of court records by The Associated Press have found that federal prosecutors have filed more than 300 cases related to the protests that swept America after Floyd’s death.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also found that more than 120 defendants have pleaded guilty to crimes such as rioting and arson and that more than 70 have received sentences, with the average penalty being 27 months in prison.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graham, one of Trump’s staunchest allies in the Senate, said granting pardons to people who tried to intimidate and stop lawmakers from doing their jobs would set a bad precedent.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It reinforces violence. The people who defiled the Capitol and took the law in their own hands deserve to be brought to justice,” he said.  </p>",

        "description": "<p>Democrats are eyeing what they believe is an increasingly realistic path to victory in Florida’s marquee midterm races after months of hesitation over just how aggressively to contest the state this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sunshine State has proven elusive to Democrats in recent years; former President Trump carried it in both 2016 and 2020, Republicans have outpaced Democrats in voter registrations and the party has struggled with mounting losses among Latinos, a key constituency that Democrats once saw as a reliable voting bloc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But recent polling has reignited Democratic interest in Florida, fueling hope among party operatives and officials that they just might be able to oust Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Marco Rubio (R) this year and reassert Florida’s reputation as a swing state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t want to sound overly optimistic. We still have a lot of work to do,” said one Democratic consultant involved in key races in Florida. “But things are trending in the right direction.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democrats got their latest boost this week from two new polls that suggest their top candidates may be starting to close the gap with DeSantis and Rubio. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One, from Susquehanna Polling and Research, found Charlie Crist, the Democratic nominee for governor, trailing DeSantis by a narrow 4-point margin, within the survey’s margin of error. The same poll found Rep. Val Demings, the Democratic Senate nominee, running just 3 points behind Rubio. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another poll, commissioned by the AARP, put the match-ups even closer. DeSantis led Crist by just 3 points, while Rubio held a slim 2-point advantage over Demings, according to the survey, which was conducted by the GOP firm Fabrizio Ward and the Democratic firm Impact Research.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recent bump for Crist and Demings dovetails with the momentum that has lifted Democrats in other key races across the country over the past two months. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Supreme Court’s decision over the summer to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights case, has energized the party’s voters after a prolonged period of relative listlessness and given Democrats an outlet to cast Republicans as overly zealous when it comes to curbing individual liberties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas Kennedy, a Democratic National Committee member from Miami, said that argument may go particularly far in Florida, a state that has long been a refuge for abortion rights in the South. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also pointed to other examples of what Democrats say is DeSantis’s heavy-handed approach to governance: suspending a state attorney who pledged not to prosecute people for violating abortion restrictions, promoting legislation clamping down on protests and pushing a new congressional map that was seen by many as a blatant Republican gerrymander.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Kennedy said, Democrats in Florida have positioned themselves as a force for less intrusive government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’re in this weird dynamic where the Democrats here are the ones preaching small government and the right to privacy and for the government not to get involved in our personal lives,” Kennedy said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the hurdles for Democrats are hard to ignore. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis is deeply popular among Republicans, not just in Florida, but nationally, and has raised more than $130 million so far for his reelection campaign — far more than Crist, who is only a few weeks removed from a bitter primary fight against state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The poll from Susquehanna Polling and Research that showed DeSantis leading Crist by only a few percentage points also found the governor’s favorability rating well above water. Crist’s favorability, on the other hand, stood in negative territory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while Demings has repeatedly outraised Rubio, the Republican senator still commands nearly twice as much cash on hand as she does. He also has a history of winning his races by margins often unheard-of in Florida statewide races. In 2016, for instance, he beat Democrat Patrick Murphy by 8 points — a landslide by Sunshine State standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also deeper issues plaguing Democrats in Florida. The state Democratic Party is still clawing its way back from the brink of financial ruin. The number of active voters registered with the GOP surpassed the number registered as Democrats for the first time in the state’s history late last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there’s also the historical precedent that the party of a new president — in this case the Democrats — almost always suffer poor performances in midterm election years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one sign that some Democratic groups are still hesitant to put too much stock in Florida this year, many of the party’s largest donors and outside groups have held off on spending money in the state. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, for instance, spent tens of millions of dollars in the state in 2020, but has only given about $1 million to the state Democratic Party this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, Priorities USA, the largest Democratic super PAC, hasn’t announced any plans for Florida this year, despite spending heavily in other key battleground states like Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Nevada.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As of this moment, unless there’s huge outside support, we’re not going to see Democrats be able to keep up,” said Aubrey Jewett, a political science professor at the University of Central Florida.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Democrats say that despite the challenges, Florida remains a key battleground. And as such, they have little choice but to contest it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Florida suffers from a little bit of a bad reputation these days — and that’s probably well earned,” one national Democratic strategist said. “But we don’t get to pick and choose. It’s the third largest state in the country. We’ve got to compete, and national Democrats have to act like Florida is a swing state, because it definitely is.”</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/3637188-biden-leaves-american-muslims-wanting/",
        "description": "<p>When President Biden was elected in 2020, Muslim Americans hoped to see a change in representation in government.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, hate crimes against Muslims were on the rise, and anti-Islamic rhetoric was surging, which critics attribute, in part, to former President Trump.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former president took a hardline stance on Muslims, signing an executive order in 2017 banning foreign nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries and sending shockwaves throughout the Muslim American community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But almost two years into the Biden administration, Muslims in the U.S. are split on the accomplishments — and failures — of the administration’s efforts to represent the community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since his inauguration, President Biden has attempted to include Muslims in his government, appointing several Muslim Americans to high-profile public offices.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The list includes: Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission; Sameera Fazil, National Economic Council Deputy Director; Reema Dodin, White House Office of Legislative Affairs Deputy Director; and Rashad Hussain, Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Biden’s first policies after being sworn in was to reverse the controversial “Muslim ban,” condemning the policy of his predecessor as a “stain on our national conscience.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Beyond contravening our values, these Executive Orders and Proclamations have undermined our national security. They have jeopardized our global network of alliances and partnerships and are a moral blight that has dulled the power of our example the world over,” he said at the time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are no Muslim Americans serving in the president’s Cabinet, and experts say that the community is still dealing with the consequences of the former administration’s policies.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert McCaw, director of government affairs at the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization, told The Hill that as a candidate “Trump was able to tap into a real political undercurrent of Islamophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment that was rising in America, which resulted in the Muslim ban.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The ban itself lit a fire under the Muslim community to politically mobilize: to register to vote and make our voices heard in Congress,” he added.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This mobilization proliferated. A recent CAIR poll found that more than 91 percent of registered Muslim Americans respondents are likely to vote in the upcoming midterms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Biden’s reversal of the ban was commended by advocates, CAIR added that both the Biden administration and Congress still need to “take action to repair the damage done” to everyone impacted by the ban. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“On day one, the president overturned the Trump administration's Muslim ban, which was deeply appreciated by the Muslim community, but then he left all those Diversity Visa recipients who lost their chance at the American dream in a lurch,” said McCaw. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>International affairs remain a top concern for many in the U.S. Muslim community, McCaw added.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CAIR poll showed the top five most important Muslim-related foreign policy issues included the Israel-Palestine conflict, Chinese treatment of Uyghur Muslims, oppression of Muslims in India, repression of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar and starvation in Afghanistan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Despite multiple requests from the Muslim community and Congress to use his executive powers to create the special envoy position at the State Department to combat and monitor Islamophobia — especially for places like China, India, Burma and France — the President has not acted, even though House Democrats last December passed a bill designed to create such a position, which had the backing of key senators like Cory Booker, Ben Cardin and Bernie Sanders,” said McCaw. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest criticisms American Muslim community has of the administration is its handling of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue received renewed attention following the death of Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh who was killed covering Israeli military raids on the West Bank. The State Department issued a statement in early July saying that a review of investigations conducted by both the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and the Palestinian Authority was inconclusive.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, the IDF said that Abu Akleh was likely killed by Israeli fire, according to CNN.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Muslim Americans found Biden’s response disappointing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to McCaw, the Biden administration's public response to Abu Akleh’s death were “disturbing”.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others believe that Biden’s track record when it comes to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has never wavered.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He has a very long history of being very pro-Israel,” said Hussein Ibish, Senior Resident Scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He's a strong defender of weapons sales and what they call a qualitative military edge, which is the promise the US has made to Israel to make sure that it will always be able to defeat any local rivals or combination of rivals in the Middle East, including other U.S. allies. So, there is as promised to keep the Israelis better armed than anybody else. He's for that. And he's sort of very friendly with the Israeli center right.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hill has reached out for comment from the White House on this criticism. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Ibish added that Biden is a firm supporter of a two-state solution, noting that the current president’s approach to the issue isn’t all that different from his predecessors dating back to former President Reagan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while Muslims prefer Biden to Trump, his approval rating remains at 28 percent within the community, according to the CAIR poll.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Executive director of the Muslim Justice League Fatema Ahmad said much of that has to do with Biden’s domestic policies.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahmad was in high school when the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks occurred. But she endured “vehement” racism in her community long before then — and it only increased after the attacks.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now she’s concerned about attacks from what she says is an unjust system as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I'm much more worried about the FBI surveilling me day to day than the individual or interpersonal level of violence,” said Ahmad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her organization works to dismantle the Countering Violent Extremism task force, which Biden vowed to end while on the campaign trail.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In the past five to seven years many Muslim folks around the country realized that this was really dangerous,” she explained. “It would lead to racial and religious profiling and actually chill access to social services.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahmad said that there has been no substantive change in the way that the FBI and other U.S. law enforcement organizations deal with Muslim Americans on a day-to-day basis.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Anytime folks go to the airport, they just expect to be harassed,” she said. “They expect to be interrogated. It's not just the invasive pat downs. People get pulled aside by CBP into a room. They're questioned on their faith and their politics.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These instances have led to increased feelings of distrust toward government within the Muslim American community, she said, adding that this close to midterms, both Biden and his party need to step up their messaging to the community to win their votes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“[Democrats] need to take a serious look at what the FBI has been doing, what has the Department of Homeland Security and all of its offices been doing, and reflect on that,” Ahmad said. “There's a pretty big disconnect to then ask us to engage with those agencies on civil rights issues.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>McCaw said that Democrats need to remember that a large population of Muslim Americans cast their ballots in swing states in 2020, helping them secure the White House. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Now, he said, they need to give back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Don’t engage us only during election season,” McCaw said. “Show up after you're elected to your local mosque. Get to know its congregants and leaders and what they're concerned about locally and nationally.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Abdullah Hammoud (D), the first Muslim mayor of Dearborn, Mich., told The Hill that the Muslim American community in his city sees the current administration’s policies as favorable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Especially as a president who came in right in the midst of a pandemic, to roll out the resources that he has. There's been many successes that Biden can hold his head on. I firmly believe it. And I think people see it. I just think it's a difficult time right now because inflation is still at a record high, although unemployment is coming down, and people are still struggling,” he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Hammoud said it’s still too early to give a firm assessment on the Biden administration’s performance thus far.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think collectively amongst minorities, there's always gonna be this demand where we believe those in the elected office are falling short because it's been decades, if not centuries, of inequities that have been perpetuated by every single person in office that has to be addressed,” Hammoud added.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So I think we'll always be left longing for more regardless of which president is in office, that’s just the reality,” Hammoud said. </p>",

        "description": "Lindsey Wasson-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>For the second time over the past three weekends, the Braves experience less than ideal results against a playoff-caliber team. </p> <p>Just 48 hours ago, the Braves were in sole possession of first place in the NL East. Now, as the Braves look to get back on track against the Giants, they have lost two straight games and are now 1 1⁄2 games behind the Mets in the division. </p>\n<p>While there obviously is still plenty of games remaining for the Braves to eventually win the division and hopefully earn a postseason bye, there also is a relevant concern that continues to emerge during the home stretch of the season. </p>\n\n\n<p>Jansen has now blown three of his past seven save opportunities.</p>— Mark Bowman (@mlbbowman) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Kenley Jansen’s blown save in the ninth inning of Sunday’s game was his third blown save in his last seven appearances. While stretches like this occur for many MLB relievers nearly every season, Jansen’s struggles have now lingered for an extended period of time. </p>\n<p>Consider his production before and after his stint on the injured list in early July: </p>\n<p>Before injury stint (went on IL on 6/26) : </p>\n<p>32 2⁄3 IP, 2.17 FIP, 2.61 xFIP, 12.95 Ks/9, 2.20 BBs/9 </p>\n<p>Since return from injury (returned from IL 7/13):  </p>\n<p>19 1⁄3 IP, 4.70 FIP, 5.12 xFIP, 10.07 Ks/9, 5.07 BBs/9</p>\n<p>Whether or not Jansen’s latest blown save will lead to any changes in how he is used or Atlanta’s closer situation remains to be seen. What is evident is that, at least right now, Jansen’s inconsistences make it hard to trust him in high leverage situations, especially against quality competition. </p>\n<p>On a more positive note, one player who continues to improve and play at an elite level is Michael Harris II. Harris produced the first multi-homer game of his career on Sunday. Harris II and fellow 2022 rookie star Julio Rodriguez sharing the same field over the weekend in Seattle had to be a treat for fans. However, the level that Harris II is playing at offensively currently is not just impressive for a rookie. He legitimately has been one of the best hitters in baseball over the past six weeks. </p>\n<p>Since August 1st, Michael Harris II is tied for 2nd in fWAR among MLB position players. He is  4th in wOBA, 3rd in OPS, and 3rd in wRC+. Only Aaron Judge has produced more value among position players over this time frame. While Spencer Strider has been incredible since joining the Braves rotation, if Harris II continues this level of production throughout September, the NL ROY race could be one of the biggest award debates in recent history. </p>\n<p></p>\nBraves News\nFormer Braves reliever Anthony Varvaro tragically died in an automobile accident on Sunday. \n\n\n<p>We are deeply saddened on the passing of former Braves pitcher Anthony Varvaro.  Anthony, 37, played parts of six seasons in the majors, including four with Atlanta.He voluntarily retired from MLB in 2016 to become a Port Authority police officer. pic.twitter.com/YSoisa79o4</p>— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\nJ.R. Ritchie and Darius Vines had excellent performances over the weekend on the farm. \nBrad Rowland and Eric Cole discuss another roller coaster weekend for the Braves and what it means moving forward in the latest edition of the Battery Power Podcast. \n\n<p></p>\nMLB News\n\nAlbert Pujols hit career home run number 697 on Sunday, earning him sole possession of 4th place on the MLB all-time home run list. \nWhile Zac Gallen’s scoreless innings streak ended Sunday, he did produce the seventh longest such streak in MLB history. \nPadres’ reliever Drew Pomeranz is likely done for the 2022 season. \nThe Phillies could be a suitor for current Red Sox shortstop Xander Boagerts this offseason if he elects free agency.",

        "description": "Photo by Michael Urakami/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>A day of rest is on the docket after a surprisingly successful homestand.</p> <p>The Yankees needed a big homestand to pull themselves out of their spiral, and for the most part they did just that. It looked scary for a moment after they dropped the finale to the Twins and the opener to the Rays, but two won series is just what they were looking for. The offense has been cooking for the last two days, and in particular Giancarlo Stanton and Gleyber Torres have looked much better. I’ll hold off on diagnosing the offensive woes as over, but there’s some hope that the lineup won’t be paper thin anymore.</p>\n<p>The team is off while kicking off their next road trip, which begins in Boston, but we’ll still have plenty for you to check out. After I provide the latest Judge tracker and Jake goes over the AL pennant races, John starts us off with a look at the roster crunch facing the team once players start to return from the IL. Josh makes the case for Jose Trevino to get every start he physically can going forward, Sam examines Torres’ swing and what has gone wrong with him in the second half, and Chris makes the case for Lou Trivino’s potential role in the postseason. Finally, I’ll be around again for the mailbag request.</p>\nToday’s Matchup:\n<p>Off-day</p>\nFun Questions/Prompts:\n<p>  1. Which currently injured Yankee would be the most impactful return?</p>\n<p>  2. How confident are you in the Yankees’ division hopes after surviving this last test against Tampa?</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>There have been as many changes to playing rules under Manfred as in the previous 100 years</p> <p>Baseball is described as America’s National Pastime because of it’s tradition. The game’s origins date back to pre-civil war days, before any other major professional sports leagues were in existence. Over time, traditions were established. At the heart of these traditions is a set of playing rules that have governed the game itself for over 160 years. </p>\n<p>Very little has changed in the basic playing rules of baseball since the National and American leagues settled on eight franchises in each league at the turn of the 20th Century. Since the first modern day World Series was held between the league winners in 1903, for a period over 50 years, there were no franchises to fold or pick up and relocate to another city. </p>\n<p>While the leagues began to expand west to the Pacific Ocean, south to Florida and Texas, and north into Canada, the playing rules have remained consistent. That is until now, when commissioner Rob Manfred decided that the game could be made better, at least according to his definition of better.  Manfred’s new “competition committee” is ushering in a host of changes for the 2023 season that fundamentally change the game. </p>\n<p>In its’ formative years, the rules of the game saw significant changes to the playing rules from the original “Knickerbocker rules” established in 1847, as well as to the equipment, statistical definitions, and the use of technology. By the time the National league was formed in 1876, the game had settled on nine men on a team, nine innings in a game- unless it was tied, an umpire called balls and strikes, a caught fly ball was an out. And always, a run was scored by a batter advancing around the bases- all four bases- and crossing home plate before three outs were recorded.</p>\n<p>There were still fundamental changes to be made to the game in the 19th century, as the game evolved from having a “pitchers box” that was anywhere from 3ft x 12 ft, to 6 ft square with the front edge being 50 feet from home plate, to a pitching mound with a rubber slab that was 60 ft, 6 inches from home. That rule was finalized in 1893. The count of four balls for a walk and three strikes you’re out was finalized in 1889. </p>\n<p>The finishing touches adopted in the last decade of the 19th century included the infield fly rule, counting foul balls as strikes until the batter had two strikes. foul bunts and held foul balls are always strikes, and the catcher’s interference rule. </p>\n<p>There were very, very few significant changes to the playing rules during the entire 20th century. In 1926, a ball that bounced over the fence became a standard “ground rule” double in all parks. The pitching mound was lowered in 1969, and the American league adopted the designated hitter rule in 1973.</p>\n<p>There were tweaks to the size of the strike zone, defensive interference, and banning of spitballs, but most of the changes had to do with statistics or technology. The definition of a sacrifice fly changed numerous times through the years, and there were changes to what constitutes a “save”. Expansion brought more playoff games, but the playing rules remained constant. </p>\n<p>Lighting was a big change, with the first night game being played in 1935. The ability to turn on the lights all but eliminated tie games, which would be called because of darkness, and then either replayed or resumed at various times. But the game was always played to a conclusion, under the same scoring rules through the final innings.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the game was the game. Baseball kept it’s traditions and it’s playing rules. </p>\n\n<p>The biggest changes to the game were in the areas of expansion from 16 to 30 teams between 1961 and 1997, and technology with first radio then television, and then cable TV bringing more games into more households than ever. The first night World Series game wasn’t staged until 1971, but now a day game is much more the exception than the rule. Post season games in particular are scheduled in “prime time” for the television audience. </p>\n<p>Technology brought in another major change to the game, though not to the playing rules themselves, with the introduction of instant replay reviews in 2008. First, home runs could be reviewed, and then reviews were expanded to almost every play except calling balls and strikes. Technology will change that, too, but playing rules remained the same.</p>\n<p>Then came Rob Manfred, with ideas to make the game better. It started with modifying the rules on runners sliding into home or breaking up a double play.  But more important to Manfred, the pace of the game was too slow, which wasn’t good for television, which in turn put a damper on profits. There was no point in playing games, in the world according to Manfred, if owners weren’t making money. </p>\n<p>Once the owners had cashed their checks from the regional sports networks and beer concessions had closed at the ballpark, extra innings were just a waste of time. The Covid pandemic gave him just the excuse that he needed to usher in the “ghost runner” rule that was experimented with in the minor leagues, to all but eliminate the games that dragged on into multiple extra innings. If he had to destroy 150 years of tradition by changing the scoring rules to get rid of non profit baseball, so be it. While the rule was tolerated by fans in the Covid season of 2020, it was widely unpopular as MLB twice brought it back ‘for one more season’ under the guise of player health and safety. In reality, the motive can be found by following the money. </p>\n<p>The commissioner brought in seven inning double headers, and cut the season to 60 games in 2020, when many more games could have been played. This was “offset” according to the narrative, by expanding the number of playoff teams to 16. In fact, lost profits were offset, but lost salaries and lost games were not. </p>\n<p>While the players’ association filed a grievance for shortening the season, and cutting their paychecks in the process, that was withdrawn as a last concession under threat of canceling part of the 2022 season, which it seemed the owners were perfectly willing to do in bargaining, as long as the big money post season games were played. </p>\n<p>Also adopted as part of the new collective bargaining agreement was the creation of a “competition committee” that was formed to rubber stamp whatever changes to the playing rules the commissioner wanted to implement. The committee is comprised of four members representing players, one from the umpires, and six appointed by the commish himself. </p>\n<p>It didn’t take long for the new committee to swing into action, as they have adopted a pitch clock, a ban on defensive shifts that tell teams where their players must stand on the field, bigger bases, and restrictions on pitchers throwing to first base to keep the runner close. The players unanimously opposed the pitch clock and shift change rules, but it didn’t matter. All the commissioner’s men stood together and rammed the rules through. </p>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest change of all in the new CBA was the creation of the committee itself, because that allowed Manfred to usher in fundamental changes to the game. </p>\n<p>Players are not without culpability in the changes to the playing rules. They have gone along with the ghost runner each time the issue came up, and they conceded the format of the competition committee. Previously, they could at least oppose any rule changes and block them for a year. </p>\n<p>Whether the changes are good or bad is a matter of opinion. But the result is that the playing rules of baseball have undergone more significant rule changes under this commissioner’s tenure than it has seen in the previous 100 years of major league baseball.</p>",

        "description": "<p>On January 3, 2020, the United States killed Qassem Soleimani with a drone strike just outside Baghdad International Airport. In an instant, the most powerful Iranian soldier of his generation was reduced, with his carpool companions, to smoldering bits of flesh surrounded by mangled SUV parts. The operation was not quite over. The message sent via missile was followed, a former U.S. intelligence official told me, by a verbal message, like a love note attached to a box of chocolates. The official, who worked on the Soleimani portfolio and requested anonymity to speak freely, did not see the message but says it was calculated to menace, reassure, and avoid uncontrolled escalation. He summarized it: The killing of Soleimani is an isolated event. It is not the start of a new campaign. But if you retaliate—and retaliation is defined as harming even one U.S. citizen, anywhere—we will hit you back harder than you hit us. You will lose every round. Your only decision is how many rounds we go, and how badly you want to be humiliated.</p><p>[Read: Qassem Soleimani haunted the Arab world]</p><p>Although Iran vowed revenge, and days later sent a volley of missiles into an American base in Iraq’s Anbar province, it seems to have taken the valentine seriously. (No one was killed in the Anbar strike. Iran did, however, test the boundaries of the threat: More than 100 U.S. personnel were later found to have lasting neurological effects from the blasts.) But in the past six weeks, three incidents suggest that Iran is ready for another round, this time with new, more amateurish tactics.</p>\r\n\tOn July 29, a man with a loaded AK-47 was arrested after lurking on the Brooklyn doorstep of the most prominent Iranian dissident in America, the writer Masih Alinejad. The man was Khalid Mehdiyev of Yonkers. The FBI disrupted a separate Iranian plot against her last year; it involved kidnapping her and taking her to Iran via Venezuela. She told me that the FBI warned her: “This time, they wanted to kill you.” She says that two days after the July incident, the current national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, called to warn her that this second attempt might not be the last, and to stress the government’s commitment to holding Iran accountable. “It’s clear to them that this is Iran,” she said. (Sullivan did not respond to requests for comment.)\r\n\tOn August 10, the FBI unsealed a criminal complaint against a member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Shahram Poursafi, for offering someone in the United States cryptocurrency for the murder of former National Security Adviser John Bolton. He asked that the assassin, whom he’d met online, kill Bolton in time for the second anniversary of Soleimani’s assassination. Bolton told CNN that he was embarrassed at the low price on his head: just $300,000, compared with the cool million that Poursafi suggested he might pay for former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\r\n\tOn August 12, a New Jersey man stabbed the author Salman Rushdie in the face, neck, and belly at an event in upstate New York. Hadi Matar’s mother told the Daily Mail that he’d gone to his ancestral home of Lebanon a few years ago and come back irate at her failure to have raised him strictly in his Shiite faith. On social media, Matar reportedly posted pictures of Iran’s leaders, including the current leader, Ali Khamenei, and his predecessor, Ruhollah Khomeini, who issued Rushdie’s 1989 death sentence for writing The Satanic Verses. Iran’s official media practically begged for their government to be given credit. Newspapers celebrated it and sometimes mentioned Soleimani. One particularly lurid photo in Jam-e Jam showed Rushdie with devil horns, pointed ears, and an empty, puckered socket where his eye had been.\r\n<p>Afshon Ostovar, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School, told me that since the Soleimani assassination, Iran’s military and intelligence services have obsessed over proving that they, too, can kill senior officials of hostile countries. “They desperately want to achieve some form of revenge,” Ostovar said. “But this covert stuff,” like the U.S. assassination of Soleimani or Israel’s killing of Iran’s top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, ”is something they just haven’t mastered.” Instead they have tried and failed to execute overseas operations, Ostovar says, and each failure has reminded them of their weakness. Killing Bolton or Pompeo, the second target in the Bolton plot, would restore confidence in their status on the international assassination scene.</p><p>But even assuming a solid connection to Iran, these three recent cases would not demonstrate that it can kill with the same professionalism and brio as the Americans and Israelis. (The Fakhrizadeh assassination is widely thought to have been carried out remotely, by killer robots that self-destructed on-site after completing their mission.) The plots to kill Bolton, Alinejad, and Rushdie are not even as sophisticated as the Mykonos affair in Berlin in 1992, which involved trained operatives, not freelance bumblers, in a Mob-style restaurant slaying.</p><p>These plots may more closely resemble Islamic State attacks in 2015, many of which involved little more than moral support from ISIS’s home office, in Raqqah. One of the Islamic State’s great strategic innovations over its doddering predecessor, al-Qaeda, was to realize that it didn’t need spectacular, expensive plots like September 11, and could terrorize much more cheaply by encouraging jihadist knuckleheads abroad to stab and run down infidels using knives and rented trucks. It didn’t need to train assassins and outfit them with fake IDs or diplomatic cover. It could just use volunteer or cheap contract labor, a gig assassin.</p><p>[George Packer: Killing Soleimani was worse than a crime]</p><p>These operations by knucklehead-proxy probably reflect the limits of what Iran can do. They may also represent Iran’s testing of the valentine wire, to see what it can do without getting hit back. (And not for the first time. As mentioned, service members at the base in Anbar suffered lasting injuries.) Alinejad told me that Iranians overseas already know that in Turkey, Germany, and even Canada, Iran’s power is great enough to threaten the lives of its enemies. Now Iran may be trying to show that it can whack Americans in the United States, too.</p><p>The Biden administration is not powerless here. Nor is escalation its only option. It considers a nuclear deal with the Iranian regime preferable to no deal—and a deal would probably be set back by years by any assassination of a U.S. official, even one retired from a now-disfavored administration. (All of this raises a question: How much does Iran want a deal, anyway?) A fitting response to the development of a new campaign of murder would be to make any agreement contingent, as the one under President Barack Obama was not, on Iran’s renunciation of its international terror operations. Otherwise, in light of these recent cases, any compromise with Iran will look like a sweetheart deal, box of chocolates or no.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Nice vistas and a scenery-chewing Famke Janssen aren’t enough to save this absurd scriptural rehash from movie hell</p><p>The latest from evangelical Christian producers Pinnacle Peak – formerly Pure Flix, the money behind the surprisingly enduring God’s Not Dead series – is an adaptation of a Francine Rivers novel that remaps the biblical tale of Hosea on to a western goldrush setting. That synopsis suggests a level of creative imagination and ambition, possibly something like Michael Winterbottom hauling The Mayor of Casterbridge further west for 2000’s The Claim. Yet this movie thinly scatters a parable’s worth of plot across 134 minutes and resembles HBO’s Deadwood recut for Sunday-school purposes: pious, puzzling and punitive, with a sternly wagging finger never far from entering the frame.</p><p>Let us give Pinnacle Peak this: they’re getting mildly more sophisticated about delivering The Message. DJ Caruso, a studio director of the mid-00s thrillers Taking Lives and Disturbia, gives the courtship of soulfully bestubbled farmer Michael Hosea (Tom Lewis) and Pair-a-Dice’s star sex worker Angel (Abigail Cowen) a sunny, handsome, Nicholas Sparks-like sheen. (It’s the best-looking faith movie since 2014’s Heaven Is For Real.) And unlike the early, cheaper Pure Flix ventures, this one has proper actors. Famke Janssen enjoys herself as a brothel madam, while the leads – raised exclusively on wholegrain breakfast cereal – are sincere enough in their Best Little Whorehouse on the Prairie way.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Troops parade for Queen Elizabeth II as she arrives in Kingston, Jamaica, in 2002.PA Images via Getty Images<p>Queen Elizabeth II's death has garnered a spectrum of feelings around the world about her life, legacy and the monarchy.</p><p> When she took the throne in 1952, more than a quarter of the world's population was under British imperial power. That was more than 700 million people — including in parts of Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the Pacific islands. </p><p>While her 70-year reign saw the British Empire become the Commonwealth of Nations — and the decline of the United Kingdom's global influence — the scars of colonialism linger. Many note the enslavement, violence and theft that defined imperial rule, and they find it difficult to separate the individual from the institution and its history.</p><p>Moses Ochonu, a professor of African studies at Vanderbilt University, told NPR the queen's death brought attention to \"unfinished colonial business.\" </p><p>\"There is a sense in which Britain has never fully accounted for its crimes,\" Ochonu said. </p>Elizabeth was associated with colonial and de-colonized Britain<p>The memory of Elizabeth is complicated by the fact that during her rule, more than 20 countries gained independence, Ochonu said.</p><p>\"It's her dual status as the face of colonialism, but also a symbol of decolonization that defines how she is perceived in many former British African colonies.\"</p><p>Ochonu's own feelings toward the queen's death are mixed — in part because of his childhood. He was born in Nigeria, a little over a decade after the country saw an end to colonial rule. </p><p>He recalled how the queen continued to be fondly associated with prestige and grandeur. Images of Elizabeth as a young woman visiting parts of Africa humanized the crown and the monarch.</p>Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip wave from an open Land Rover to a crowd of schoolchildren at a rally held in Nigeria in 1956. The country would gain independence four years later.Fox Photos/Hulton Archive/Getty Images<p>But coupled with that nostalgia is \"residual anger\" over the brutal price paid for many countries' independence. Ochonu said in Nigeria, many are still haunted by Britain's role in their civil war, when the global power secretly tried to prevent the Republic of Biafra's secession efforts. In Kenya, Britain tortured thousands of rebels in detention camps, for which it apologized in 2013.</p><p>That's why Ochonu said her death prompts a time of reflection rather than mourning. </p>Elizabeth was a symbol of Britain's denial for colonial crimes<p>Others find it difficult to celebrate the queen's life — in part because they feel she should accountable for what her country did.</p><p>\"We essentially have to respect her for her very long service, but as the monarch, she cannot be disentangled  from colonization of South Asia,\" Mou Banerjee, a professor of South Asian history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told NPR.</p><p>Banerjee is from India, which gained independence from Britain in 1947.  Although Elizabeth was crowned five years later, Banerjee said many Indians hoped the queen would express remorse for the damages of colonialism.  </p><p>That was the case in 1997 during what would be the queen's last visit to India. Elizabeth told Indians \"history cannot be rewritten\" in reference to the 1919 massacre in Jallianwala Bagh, where hundreds of Indians were shot and killed by British troops.</p><p>Those sentiments have resurfaced as many wonder what will happen to the queen's crown jewel following her death. During colonial times, India was forced to hand over the 105-carat Kohinoor diamond to Britain. Many are also calling for the return of the Cullinan diamond back to South Africa.</p><p>\"The jewels represent a history of coercion, subjugation, loot, loss, grief,\" Banerjee said.  </p><p>Similarly, the queen's death has also reminded many people of the lack of reparations to former colonies. </p>People calling for slavery reparations protest outside the entrance of the British High Commission during the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in Kingston, Jamaica, earlier this year.Ricardo Makyn/AFP via Getty Images<p>Opal Palmer Adisa, the former director of the Institute for Gender and Development Studies at the University of the West Indies, told All Things Considered Britain has yet to even apologize to the African diaspora.</p><p>Over 2.2 million enslaved people were taken to British colonies in the Caribbean. </p><p>Palmer Adisa said in Jamaica, children were not taught specifics about what happened under British rule — even when discussing slavery.</p><p>\"The implications and the horrendous actions of the British ... were never delineated,\" she said.</p>Many people are wondering why the British monarchy still exists<p>For some, the queen's death has reignited conversations around the purpose and place for a monarch today. </p><p>Banerjee has been skeptical of the crown from a young age, when she would hear her grandparents' anecdotes of the Bengal famine of 1943, where at least 3 million people died of starvation as a result of Britain's overseas economic policies. </p><p>Although Elizabeth's eldest son now sits on the throne, Banerjee believes this can still be a time of reckoning over the institution.</p><p>\"They say, the sun never sets on the British Empire. I think it has set with the death of Queen Elizabeth,\" Banerjee said. </p><p>\"It is time that we come to terms with that history of enslavement, that history of colonization.\" </p><p>Copyright 2022 NPR.

Each child of a parent with this mutation has a 50% chance of inheriting it.Juan Diego Reyes for NPR<p>In some families, Alzheimer's disease seems inevitable.</p><p>\"Your grandmother has it, your mom has it, your uncle has it, your aunts have it, your cousin has it. I always assumed that I would have it,\" says Karen Douthitt, 57.</p><p>\"It was always in our peripheral vision,\" says Karen's sister June Ward, 61.</p><p>\"Our own mother started having symptoms at age 62, so it has been a part of our life.\"</p><p>Nearly a decade ago, Karen, June, and an older sister, Susie Gilliam, 64, set out to learn why Alzheimer's was affecting so many family members.</p><p>Since then, each sister has found out whether she carries a rare gene mutation that makes Alzheimer's inescapable. And all three have found ways to help scientists trying to develop treatments for the disease.</p>Bad news on the golf course<p>I met Karen and June in 2015, at the first-ever conference for families with a particular type of genetic mutation in which Alzheimer's often appears in middle age.</p><p>The annual conference is sponsored by the Alzheimer's Association and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network Trials Unit, a research program run by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.</p><p>Karen and June had come to Washington, D.C., for the family conference because of something they had just learned about a cousin on their mother's side.</p><p>The cousin had developed Alzheimer's in her 50s. And genetic tests showed that she carried a rare, inherited gene mutation called presenilin 1. It's one of three mutations that typically cause Alzheimer's to appear in middle age.</p><p>The three gene mutations responsible for early Alzheimer's are unlike a better known gene called APOE4, which merely increases the likelihood somewhat that a person will develop Alzheimer's – and usually at age 65 or older. In contrast, the early-onset mutations, including presenilin 1, make it almost certain an individual will develop the disease, and usually before age 60.</p><p>Each child of a parent who has the presenilin 1 mutation has a 50% chance of inheriting it.</p><p>The genetic finding in Karen's cousin seemed to explain why the sisters' mother had developed Alzheimer's in her early 60s. And it meant that any of the sisters, or all three of them, might also carry the mutation.</p><p>Karen got the news in March of 2015, during a round of golf.</p><p>Her takeaway: \"We now have a coin flip of whether we'll develop Alzheimer's by the time we're 62.\" That was \"kind of a heavy load on the golf course,\" Karen told me at our first meeting..</p>Karen Douthitt learned that a cousin on her mother's side had undergone genetic testing and was found to be a carrier of presenilin 1, a rare genetic mutation for early-onset Alzheimer's dementia.

But the three younger girls always had a special bond, \"like a three-legged stool,\" June says.</p><p>So they made a decision together in the spring of 2015.</p><p>\"We're doing what we can do,\" June told me at the 2015 conference, \"which is to participate in the drug trials and try to take what action we can toward a better future.\"</p><p>They began raising money for the Alzheimer's Association.

They were attending the annual family conference, this time in San Diego. Susie, the eldest of the three, was there too.</p><p>By this time, all three sisters had learned whether they carried the gene mutation.</p><p>Karen, the youngest, found out just after the 2015 conference.</p><p>\"I decided to do gene testing relatively early after that meeting,\" she says, \"and I'm negative.\"</p><p>The middle sister, June, waited until March of 2016.</p>Ward (left) and Douthitt pick wildflowers down the road from their childhood home in Swannanoa, N.C.Juan Diego Reyes for NPRWard says she and her sisters enjoyed picking honeysuckles on their walks home from school when they were kids.Juan Diego Reyes for NPR<p>\"I decided I was ready to do genetic testing, just cause I like to know things,\" she says. \"And I turned out to be genetically positive for Alzheimer's disease, which means that if I live long enough I will get it, unless the [experimental] medicine works.\"</p><p>For years, Susie had chosen not to find out whether she carried the gene.</p><p>\"I asked my husband and my two children, and everybody said they'd just as soon not know,\" she says.</p><p>Eventually, though, their views changed. And in March of this year, Susie discovered that she, like June, carries the gene mutation.</p>For years, partly at her kids' and husband's urging, Susie Gilliam chose not to get tested for the gene mutation for Alzheimer's disease.Juan Diego Reyes for NPR<p>At first, she was devastated.</p><p>\"The next morning I was wallowing in self pity, and what I'm going to miss,\" Susie says. \"I'm going to miss birthdays, and my grandchildren won't know me as a healthy person.</p><p>\"But then on the front porch, in the mountains of western North Carolina, I'm rocking and there's this single cloud in a Carolina blue sky, and I was praying for Him to take my worries away. And I'm sitting there rocking and this single cloud thins and thins and thins, and then, poof, it's gone – and with it my worries.\"</p>Douthitt and her sisters grew up in the Blue Ridge Mountains in Swannanoa, N.C.Juan Diego Reyes for NPRThe sisters affectionately call their childhood family compound \"the holler.\"Juan Diego Reyes for NPRA plan for the future<p>The situation still worries little sister Karen – even though she's negative for the mutation.</p><p>Late last year, she got some alarming news about her own health. She had breast cancer. But Karen says cancer doesn't make a person feel helpless the way Alzheimer's does.</p><p>\"You go see a surgeon. You go see an oncologist. And then you have surgery and then you have radiation or chemo. There's a to-do list,\" she says. \"Susie had her diagnosis in March and her to-do list is: Go see an attorney, make a will.\"</p><p>Karen knows that June and Susie could develop symptoms at any time. She says that will be devastating for her family, which dotes on them.</p><p>\"We call 'em marshmallows, 'cause they're so sweet,\" she says.</p><p>June has found some measure of solace by participating in Alzheimer's research studies.</p><p>She knows the experimental drugs she's taking are unlikely to help her. But she hopes they'll eventually lead to treatments that will make a difference to younger members of her family.</p><p>\"If anything I do can have a positive effect for their lives and their future, I'm all in,\" she says.</p>Even though the sisters hope a successful drug treatment for their family's form of dementia will emerge, they're now planning for a future without one. \"There's a kind of sorrow about Alzheimer's disease that, as strange as it seems, there's a comfort in being in the presence of people who understand it,\" Ward says.Juan Diego Reyes for NPR<p>June also has become a regular at the annual conference for families affected by the early Alzheimer's mutations. She says it's a place to hear about scientific advances — and feel a sense of ease.</p><p>\"There's a kind of sorrow about Alzheimer's disease that, as strange as it seems, there's a comfort in being in the presence of people who understand it,\" she says.</p><p>June says attending the conference also reminds her that some other families carry a more extreme version of the gene mutation.</p><p>\"Sometimes I feel guilty because I'm a 61-year-old woman with the gene who can still have a conversation and not make too many faux-pas,\" she says. \"There are people in their 30s here that are struggling already.\"</p><p>The three sisters are still hoping for a drug that can slow down Alzheimer's. But they are also planning for a future without that drug.</p><p>Karen and her husband have moved back to her childhood home in the Blue Ridge mountains. They live in the same small house where she and her siblings were raised. It's part of a family compound they call \"the holler.\"</p><p>\"I say it's like the Kennedy compound except redneck,\" Karen says. \"Some of the houses have wheels on them. But my dream is to have both of my sisters there.\"</p><p>\"The good thing is we would be surrounded by family and people that have known us since we were children,\" June says. \"So if we walked away, somebody would help us find our way back home.\" </p><p>Copyright 2022 NPR.

The U.N. weather agency predicts the phenomenon known as La Nina is poised to last through the end of this year — its third year in a row — and affect meteorological patterns like drought and flooding worldwide.Zahid Hussain/AP<p>La Niña is back for the third year in a row.</p><p>The meteorological system over the Pacific Ocean that can influence weather patterns worldwide is projected to continue through the end of the year.</p><p>It's the first time this century that La Niña has returned for three consecutive years, according to the World Meteorological Organization, a U.N. agency.</p><p>\"It is exceptional to have three consecutive years with a la Niña event,\" WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement.</p><p>La Niña occurs when strong winds blow warm water on the surface of the Pacific Ocean near the coast of South America across the equator toward Indonesia, other parts of Asia and Australia.</p><p>That causes cooler water to rise to the surface of the Pacific Ocean, which has wide-ranging ripple effects on the weather.</p>Some people will see drier weather; others will face more floods<p>The southwestern U.S., with rain clouds pushed out to sea, becomes drier than usual. Northwestern U.S. states and Canada see cooler-than-average temperatures, rain and flooding.</p><p>Australia, Indonesia and other parts of Asia also experience heavy rainfall. La Niña can even cause more lightning activity in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Gulf Coast and increase the number of hurricanes and tropical cyclones, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>This year, scientists have also attributed a worsening drought in the Horn of Africa and the southern part of South America to La Niña.</p><p>Though the storm system will produce some cooler temperatures in one part of the world, the U.N. says that warmer sea-surface temperatures elsewhere will drive the global forecast in the coming months.</p><p>Climate change continues to drive up global temperatures and contribute to more extreme weather events, including La Niña.</p><p>\"Its cooling influence is temporarily slowing the rise in global temperatures — but it will not halt or reverse the long-term warming trend,\" Taalas said. </p><p>La Niña is the opposite of El Niño, in which the trade winds over the Pacific Ocean weaken and the water off the west coast of the Americas warms up. </p><p>Copyright 2022 NPR.

And while there's still uncertainty, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is currently projecting that the outbreak \"will most likely continue to grow very slowly\" over the next few weeks.   </p><p>Health officials say it's cause for cautious optimism — but not complacency. </p><p>Much of the improvement is being attributed to temporary changes in sexual behavior, and progress is uneven, with new cases rising in some parts of the U.S. and disproportionately affecting certain minority populations, such as Black and Latino men. </p><p>The U.S. is relying on a strategy of vaccinating high-risk populations – largely gay and queer people, particularly men who have sex with men in social networks where the virus is spreading. But there are still open questions: scientists don't yet have much real-world data on how well the JYNNEOS vaccine — approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2019 — stops infection and transmission. And the vaccination campaign must be successful at reaching those who could most benefit from the shots. </p><p>NPR caught up with Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, one month into his job as deputy coordinator for the White House Monkeypox Response, to talk about where the outbreak is headed, and what it's like to go from being an HIV doctor and queer health activist to being the out-and-proud face of the government's monkeypox response.</p><p>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. </p><p>Pien Huang: As you look out over the next few weeks or months, where do you see the outbreak headed? Is it realistic to think we could get to virtually no cases in the U.S.?</p><p>Demetre Daskalakis: I think we're going to get to a point where we'll see occasional cases because of introductions [of the virus] from other places. We'll also potentially see small clusters. But in terms of this big ol' curve that we've been seeing, I think that's going to dissipate so it's no longer an outbreak, but more episodic.</p><p>If you look at the epidemiology of cases that happen outside of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, there are a lot of terminal chains: you have somebody [with monkeypox], and then maybe their household contacts [get it] and then it ends. </p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if we continue to see little chains [of transmission]. Then, the vaccine would be used more for contact-focused vaccination as opposed to the population-based, behavior-based vaccination campaign [we have now].</p><p>You and other experts have credited changes in behavior for helping to slow the spread of monkeypox in the U.S. What does that mean for controlling the outbreak going forward, given that the virus has been spreading \"almost exclusively\" through sexual contact?   </p><p>It is not impossible that we could see cases increase if behaviors regress. We definitely see that the messaging – from CDC and the U.S. government as well as interpretations by others – has really moved the needle, in terms of some of the behaviors associated with monkeypox exposure. </p><p>Single partnerships [meaning one-time sexual encounters] that men who have sex with men report are down – 50% have stopped doing them or reduced them – less anonymous sex, all of the things we advise as temporary measures, until we get vaccines into people's arms and they can go back to life as usual. </p><p>We're in this phase where getting the supply and maintaining the demand [for vaccines] is so important. It's reasonable to think people will change behavior for awhile, but not reasonable to think that they're going to change it forever. And we're not asking for forever, we're asking for now. </p><p>Why not frame this as a sexually transmitted infection? After all, gay and queer communities are generally pretty accustomed to talking about sexual health. </p><p>The jury's out on what this is going to be called. I think what's important is: monkeypox is sexually associated, no matter what.</p><p>What's important to me is less the semantics and more that we're giving the right advice, and that the places that people go [to seek information and care] are resourced to do the work.</p><p>A paper you co-authored that was posted recently shows that many monkeypox cases are being found in people with HIV and also those with a recent history of STIs. Why is this the case?</p><p>It's the social network, and the behaviors that are associated with it, that may imply why HIV-positive men who have sex with men are overrepresented. </p><p>One of my favorite lines in the paper actually says – I like it so much, I'm going to read it to you verbatim – \"It is important that systems for delivering HIV and STI care and prevention be leveraged for monkeypox evaluation, vaccination and other prevention interventions, and treatment.\" </p><p>[On Wednesday], sort of timed with this [paper], CDC released updated guidance to some of its grantees that said that they could use both staffing and funds that are earmarked for HIV and STDs to actually support monkeypox. </p><p>It's kind of groundbreaking. It puts it into this context of this thing called a syndemic, which is like the different epidemics that interact. So it weaves monkeypox into where it belongs, which is together with the work that we do every day to prevent HIV and STIs.</p><p>Recent CDC data show that vaccination rates may be declining. It seems like we're nearing a point where many of the people who want to get vaccinated have done so. How do you make sure people get the two shots even if cases are going down?</p><p>So first, supply, supply, supply – supply is important because some of the demand changes are driven by the idea that, \"There's no vaccine, so why should I look for it?\" </p><p>We've addressed this with the new intradermal vaccine strategy increasing supply on the ground and with [getting] more [vials], whether it's from the company overseas, or with onshore fill-and-finish of the vaccine.</p><p>We've [sent vaccine doses to] some large events that signal \"the doctor is open\" and vaccines are more accessible. </p><p>The other work that we're doing is around equity. We [recently sent doses to] Atlanta Black Pride, where they did almost 4,000 vaccines, also with Southern Decadence in New Orleans, where they did about 3,500. Those are the big versions. </p><p>But we'll also soon be releasing a pathway to small equity interventions that are for niche, more innovative ideas that reach deeper into the community. </p><p>Is there a danger that people are looking at the current numbers and saying \"monkeypox is slowing, so I don't need a vaccine?\" </p><p>Always, there's a risk of people saying, \"Oh look, the curve is down and we're going to move on.\" But we've been really good about messaging that two vaccines plus two weeks means that you have optimal coverage. So the experience I'm hearing so far is that people are interested in getting their two shots and they just want [health authorities] to open up availability [so they can] get them. </p><p>What's it been like for you to be in such a visible role as the gay/queer person that's the face of the White House monkeypox response? </p><p>My very first hour of doing this, I got to meet with the President and he said my job is to make sure that we're really working hard for the LGBTQ community, especially in the vein of equity. So literally, I landed and was told to do exactly what I love doing. It's been great. </p><p>I get to work with Bob Fenton, [the White House Monkeypox Response Coordinator], who is like a rock star from the perspective of large event emergencies. I'm learning some really valuable things from him that are definitely outside my normal wheelhouse.</p><p>Is there any tension between the role you have as a government official versus your longtime work as an HIV doctor and gay health advocate? </p><p>\nThere's being the doctor for one person at a time and then there's being a doctor for an entire community and our entire population. There's a very specific responsibility you have when you're making decisions for millions of people. I value [my time working with patients]. I feel like those experiences with individual humans and patients end up making all of this make sense to me.\n\n\n</p><p>Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.</p>",

        "description": "Ukrainian State Emergency Service firefighters put out the fire after a Russian rocket attack hit an electric power station in Kharkiv, Ukraine, Sunday, Sept. 11.Kostiantyn Liberov | AP<p>Russia attacked power stations and other infrastructure Sunday, causing widespread outages across Ukraine as Kyiv's forces pressed a swift counteroffensive that has driven Moscow's troops from swaths of territory it had occupied in the northeast.</p><p>The bombardment ignited a massive fire at a power station on Kharkiv's western outskirts and killed at least one person. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the \"deliberate and cynical missile strikes\" against civilian targets as acts of terrorism.</p><p>Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv appeared to be without power Sunday night. Cars drove through darkened streets, and the few pedestrians used flashlights or mobile phones to light their way.</p><p>Separately, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in the Russia-occupied south completely shut down in a bid to prevent a radiation disaster as fighting raged nearby.</p><p>Kyiv's action in recent days to reclaim Russia-occupied areas in the Kharkiv region forced Moscow to withdraw its troops to prevent them from being surrounded, leaving behind significant numbers of weapons and munitions in a hasty flight as the war marked its 200th day on Sunday.</p><p>Ukraine's military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyy, said its forces had recaptured about 1,160 square miles since the counteroffensive began in early September. He said Ukrainian troops are only about 30 miles from the Russian border.</p><p>One battalion shared a video of Ukrainian forces in front of a municipal building in Hoptivka, a village just over a mile from the border and about 12 miles north of Kharkiv.</p><p>Kharkiv Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said Ukrainian troops have reclaimed control of more than 40 settlements in the region.</p><p>In Sunday night's missile attacks by Russia, the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions seemed to bear the brunt. Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia and Sumy had only partially lost power, Zelenskyy said.</p><p>Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov called the power outage \"revenge by the Russian aggressor for the successes of our army at the front, in particular, in the Kharkiv region.\"</p><p>Ukrainian officials said Russia hit Kharkiv TEC-5, the country's second-biggest heat and power plant, and Zelenskyy posted video of the Kharkiv power plant on fire.</p><p>\"Russian terrorists remain terrorists and attack critical infrastructure. No military facilities, only the goal of leaving people without light and heat,\" he tweeted,</p><p>But Zelenskyy remained defiant despite the attacks. Addressing Russia, he added: \"Do you still think you can intimidate, break us, force us to make concessions? ... Cold, hunger, darkness and thirst for us are not as scary and deadly as your `friendship and brotherhood.' But history will put everything in place. And we will be with gas, lights, water and food ... and WITHOUT you!\"</p><p>Later in the evening some power had been restored in some regions. None of the outages were believed to be related to the shutdown of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant.</p><p>While most attention focused on the counteroffensive, Ukraine's nuclear energy operator said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, was reconnected to Ukraine's electricity grid, allowing engineers to shut down its last operational reactor to safeguard it amid the fighting.</p><p>The plant, one of the 10 biggest atomic power stations in the world, has been occupied by Russian forces since the early days of the war. Ukraine and Russia have traded blame for shelling around it.</p><p>Since a Sept. 5 fire caused by shelling knocked the plant off transmission lines, the reactor was powering crucial safety equipment in so-called \"island mode\" — an unreliable regime that left the plant increasingly vulnerable to a potential nuclear accident.</p><p>The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog that has two experts at the site, welcomed the restoration of external power. But IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said he is \"gravely concerned about the situation at the plant, which remains in danger as long as any shelling continues.\"</p><p>He said talks have begun on establishing a safety and security zone around it.</p><p>In a call Sunday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, French President Emmanuel Macron urged the withdrawal of Russian troops and weaponry from the plant in line with IAEA recommendations.</p><p>The pullback of Moscow's forces in recent days marked the biggest battlefield success for Ukrainian forces since they thwarted a Russian attempt to seize Kyiv near the start of the war. The Kharkiv campaign seemed to take Moscow by surprise; it had relocated many of its troops from the region to the south in expectation of a counteroffensive there.</p><p>Yuriy Kochevenko, of the 95th brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, tweeted a video from what appeared to be central Izyum. The city was considered an important command and supply hub for Russia's northern front.</p><p>\"Everything around is destroyed, but we will restore everything. Izyum was, is, and will be Ukraine,\" Kochevenko said in his video, showing the empty central square and destroyed buildings.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Ukrainian General Staff said Russian troops also had left several settlements in the Kherson region, in the southern part of the country, as Kyiv's forces pressed the counteroffensive. It did not identify the areas.</p><p>But an official with the Russian-backed administration in the city of Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, said on social media that the city north of the Crimean Peninsula was safe and asked everyone to stay calm.</p><p>The Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday the withdrawal from Izyum and other areas was intended to strengthen Moscow's forces in the neighboring Donetsk region to the south. The explanation was similar to how Russia justified pulling back from Kyiv earlier this year.</p><p>But Igor Strelkov, who led Russia-backed forces when the separatist conflict in the Donbas erupted in 2014, mocked the Russian Defense Ministry's explanation of the retreat, suggesting that handing over Russia's own territory near the border was a \"contribution to a Ukrainian settlement.\"</p><p>The retreat angered Russian military bloggers and nationalist commentators, who bemoaned it as a major defeat and urged the Kremlin to step up its war efforts. Many criticized Russian authorities for continuing with fireworks and other lavish festivities in Moscow that marked a city holiday on Saturday despite the debacle in Ukraine.</p><p>In Moscow, Putin attended the opening of a huge Ferris wheel in a park on Saturday, and inaugurated a new transport link and a sports arena. The action underscored the Kremlin's narrative that the war it calls a \"special military operation\" was going according to plan without affecting Russians' everyday lives.</p><p>Pro-Kremlin political analyst Sergei Markov criticized the Moscow festivities as a grave mistake.</p><p>\"The fireworks in Moscow on a tragic day of Russia's military defeat will have extremely serious political consequences,\" Markov wrote on his messaging app channel. \"Authorities mustn't celebrate when people are mourning.\"</p><p>In a sign of a potential rift in the Russian leadership, Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed head of Chechnya, said the retreat resulted from blunders by the Russian brass.</p><p>\"They have made mistakes and I think they will draw the necessary conclusions,\" Kadyrov said. \"If they don't make changes in the strategy of conducting the special military operation in the next day or two, I will be forced to contact the leadership of the Defense Ministry and the leadership of the country to explain the real situation on the ground.\"</p><p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the head of NATO cautioned Friday the war would likely go on for months, urging the West to keep supporting Ukraine through what could be a difficult winter.</p><p>Ukraine's battlefield gains would help as the Biden administration seeks continued financial support of the war effort from Congress and Western allies, said Daniel Fried, a former U.S. ambassador to Poland and now a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington.</p><p>\"The Biden administration policy is evolving in a direction that is more and more justified,\" Fried said. </p><p>Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "<p>Six Books With Introductions Worth Pausing Over: Well, okay. Since I have tried to be a conduit for old books, I have no business criticizing this — but hey, like Iago I’m nothing if not critical, so: </p>\n<p>The six “stories from the past” were published in: 1916, 1980, 1869, 1952, 1983, and, basically, 1906-08 (the period during which Henry James dictated to a secretary his prefaces to his novels). Might it not be possible to have a more expansive sense of “the past”? </p>\n<p>So here are a few essays that reckon with the ongoing value and power — the power to speak to us, to our condition — of genuinely old texts: </p>\n\nSimone Weil, “The Iliad, or the Poem of Force” \nBernard Knox, “The Oldest Dead White European Males” \nDaniel Meldelsohn, “Lost Classics” and this essay on the Aeneid and empire \nBrian Phillips (yes, the soccer guy): “The Tale of Genji as a Modern Novel” (very much worth getting through the JSTOR paywall if you can) \n\n<p>For deeper dives — from recent writers and not-so-recent ones — see Mendelsohn’s An Odyssey: A Father, A Son, and an Epic, Erich Auerbach’s Dante, Poet of the Secular World, Edward Mendelson’s The Things That Matter, and M. I. Finley’s The World of Odysseus. </p>\n<p>These are all texts that wrestle, sometimes uncomfortably, with stories from the past, stories that always speak to us but sometimes in strange dialects.</p>\n<p>On, and please read Auden’s great poem “The Shield of Achilles.”  </p>",

        "description": "<p>I’m taking a nice long weekend break after dConstruct on Friday (I will of course have more to say on that—I’m collecting my thoughts still—but it was a wonderful day).</p>\n\n<p>On Saturday I did absolutely nothing. It was just as well really, considering that I may have over-indulged in the pub on Friday evening after dConstruct was done. So a day of lounging around idly playing mandolin was just the ticket.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday, Sunday, I had one of those perfect leisurely days.</p>\n\n<p>It began with a good bout of lazing about in the morning. Then, as lunchtime approached, Jessica and I went to a nearby pub for a Sunday Roast. In this case it was the Dover Castle. It turned out to be an excellent choice—top notch roasts!</p>\n\n<p>While we were enjoying our lunch, Jessica spotted a poster on the wall for Bark In The Park, a local fun day of dog-centred activities. We were sure it had already happened earlier in Summer, but the poster said it was rescheduled to …yesterday!</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>So after lunch we went to the park and spent the next few hours in the sunshine, petting very good dogs and enjoying the spectacle of such catgories as “fancy dress”, “best rescue”, and “sausage catching.” We left shortly before the announcement of “best in show”—my money was on Mayhem—so I could nip home, grab my mandolin, and head to The Bugle pub for the weekly 4pm Irish music session.</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>After two hours of jigs’n’reels, I headed home. The weather was still lovely. The forecast was for cloudy weather, but it was unexpectedly sunny. So I fired up the outdoor grill.</p>\n\n<p>We grilled: one aubergine, halved and scored; one yellow courgette, halved; one green courgette, halved; half a hispe cabbage, quartered. Once they were nicely charred outside and soft within, we ate them with a drizzle of tahini sauce, accompanied by a green salad.</p>\n\n<p>By that time the sun had gone down and it was time for a nice evening spent watching the latest episode of The Rings Of Power and drinking a nice cup of tea.</p>\n\n<p>Like a said, a perfect leisurely day.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Something is happening to the food writers: We’re losing our minds. This job requires knowledge of not just food and cooking, plus whatever one’s niche is that makes them desirable on the market, but also to be a photographer (not new) and now a videographer—perhaps with three cameras in various positions in order to ensure a cinematic result, when we go on to act as editors. Oh, and we should maybe know how to host a podcast and edit audio, for good measure. </p><p>We are food stylists and recipe developers and restaurant recommenders. We are everything, because there’s no other choice. “Being a freelancer means you’re also an entrepreneur, which means you’re every department of your company,” says Abigail Koffler, whose newsletter This Needs Hot Sauce comes out biweekly. I am loath to think of myself as an entrepreneur. Yet here I am.</p>bettina @bettinamakonce again i think the everyone is a Content Creator economy has broken our brains<p>August 30th 2022</p>13 Retweets180 Likes<p>We’re not toiling in the mines as writers, the cultural critic Rachel Connolly helpfully reminds us on Twitter with necessary regularity. But the expectations on food people working in media specifically are a stretch (they’re also deeply gendered, a topic for another essay). </p><p>I’ve been attempting to separate myself from my own “content creation” for social media, because I am increasingly confused about what I or anyone else gets out of it. I am increasingly confused about how people perceive exactly what it is I do, as I regularly field questions about whether I work in restaurants or sell cakes. Countless people have assumed my first book, which will be out next year, is a cookbook, when I only started to regularly publish recipes at the end of 2021. </p><p>I accept more that my presence in the digital space, which was for so long where I felt more free to be myself than in the “real world,” is now a representation of what I seek to represent. I’m there somewhere, under the layers, shouting about eating more vegetables. My presence is a commercial for my brain.</p><p>A question I’ve been grappling with is whether to show a life is to sell a lifestyle. Many food people are on Instagram actually making money (I am not one of them); they’re shilling pots and making deals with KitchenAid. Supposedly, brand deals are now the only way to survive. My own spice collaboration has yielded much appreciated surprise checks this year, I will say, and it will also be the extent of my product hawking. I don’t want to be a marketer. </p><p>I’ve settled into an aesthetic groove with my photos that I’m quite proud of, until someone mentions to me that they like them for being tossed off or imperfect, and then I feel embarrassed. It’s hard to deviate from what is understood as “good” food imagery. For a while now, the visual culture of Instagram has defined the visual culture of food, but that’s changing. More trend pieces are pointing to TikTok, which doesn’t offer up a defined food aesthetic but does encourage people to use jarred garlic (apparently). (Jarred garlic is fine.)</p><p>Instagram maintains its personal-professional sheen, though, as the space to show who you are and what you do (over and over and over). I wrote for Gawker about the cultural turn toward recipe developers and away from bloggers, as well as the parasocial nature of the fandoms, which comes with assumptions around how much personal information is owed and the sense that every food person’s home and refrigerator is ready to be shown off at a moment’s notice. Baker Hetal Vasavada of Milk and Cardamom recently posted, “Spending more time making things out of joy versus appeasing the algorithm. Feeling happier and better for it to be honest.” I think this is where more people are landing, but it doesn’t mean that it will… work out.This isn’t a healthy economy—money- or attention-wise—for food folks. So much popularity is concentrated at the top, dependent upon whether you were in a certain test kitchen at the right time, and that popularity comes with many material benefits. Social media and the shitty nature of actually having a media job have enabled a rise in utter individualism when it comes to food, and the competition is as fierce as the algorithms are unpredictable. Trying not to have a scarcity mind-set becomes a spiritual pursuit. Trying to maintain originality, too.</p><p>The patterns of success tend to mimic the patterns of media hiring: thin, affluent, mostly white. (TikTok, where everyone seems to become a star to the point that follower counts are of dubious significance, does challenge this archetype.) This sameness then echoes through what is a successful aesthetic, which then gets emulated in a trickle-down pattern. This is the food content ouroborous: what is original will be replicated so much that it will become dull. </p><p>I started to feel like I’d gotten lost in all of it, like I couldn’t sense myself in the weeds of all the aesthetic input, when I was embarrassed by videos of a dinner I’d made for friends because the lighting in what was our dining room was atrocious. I had already thought about moving the table to the living room, but what made it feel necessary to me was that serving in that room looked bad. (There also isn’t enough airflow.) Could people believe my food tastes good, that they should cook my recipes and read my essays, if it didn’t look good? “Bad” photos are in, but the thing about them is that they’re not really bad or even insouciant: They’re just a different approach, less big bright lighting, a little grainy, still beautifully plated. Every anti-aesthetic eventually becomes an aesthetic.</p><p>This was something I wanted to ask Koffler about, because her newsletter doesn’t present itself as aspirational. It’s about the true day-to-day of cooking, enjoying meals with friends and loved ones, and going out to restaurants for the fun of it—oftentimes the same ones, over and over, which is how most people live. </p><p>“In New York, in the winter, the light goes at like 4:30 p.m., but I do not eat dinner at that time,” she says, by way of illustrating her photo philosophy. “And so if you want to have aesthetics as a priority, there’s a little bit more artificiality. I think it just depends what your goals are, but I’m never organized enough to cook my dinner at 4:30 p.m.” </p><p>She pointed out something I’ve noticed about myself, too, which is that I feel like I have to have two brains because I can’t have two lives or two apartments: In one, there’s the focus on “creation” for an audience; in the other, there’s actually eating and hanging out. Sometimes, they bleed into each other. This is where the problems come in, as demonstrated by my lighting freak-out: Where does my prop closet end and where do I begin?</p><p>It’s unavoidable: There’s always going to be a dominant look in food and we’re always going to want to look at pretty plates, so I think I shouldn’t be too hard on myself for moving the table. I do wish, however, that I didn’t think the success of my work would suffer because pasta wasn’t lit perfectly—that all imperfections need to be a studied choice, too. When I post something that’s not pretty, it must be clear that I know it isn’t pretty. </p><p>The sense that every meal is groundbreaking is exhausting to me, and I neither pursue it for myself nor as a recipe developer. I appreciate Julia Turshen’s notes in her newsletter that say “Not every meal you eat has to be the best meal you’ve ever had; Not every meal you eat has to go on social media” because these ideas go directly against the grain of food content expectations. </p><p>What is food media and food social media without its demand for consumption—without expectations of newness, freshness, bold colors and clear shots from people whose work is about (supposedly!) making good food, showing off that food, writing about food, thinking about food? But we can’t escape wanting to look at nice things, fancy things, extravagant things. We want our lives, lived and depicted, to be desirable. The question of the late-capitalist climate change age is, can we tame these desires? Can we make what is sustainable and real desirable instead? (Per usual, I feel conversations in fashion are ahead of food. Embedded did a fantastic transparent interview with an anti-fast fashion influencer.)</p><p>Basically, can we diversify our aesthetic desires? Can we appreciate a lifestyle without wanting to consume destructively to replicate it? Can we show our own lives, as ordinary as they most of the time are? (There is a move toward mocking influencer videos where people are shown waking up and that sort of thing, as well as people talking about romanticizing a “non-aesthetic life”—but again, the anti-aesthetic always becomes another version of the aesthetic... I never want to use this word again.) </p><p>The eternal question: Can we look at what someone else has and not believe we should also have it? I try to push this in my own way, with showing tropical fruits. Different lives in difference places—that should be the beauty of this whole thing. Wealth, though, or the appearance of wealth, the appearance of excess money, is what undergirds the entirety of social media food content creation. There is not just abundant food, but abundant plates and cloth and candles for styling said food. Because of the ongoing, relentless nature of social media, it’s not enough to occasionally flash a status symbol, to occasionally show off: It’s all day, every day.</p><p>Millicent Souris wrote brilliantly about the tension of watching rich people’s lives online amid a historic hunger crisis:</p><p>I don’t think I’m mature enough to witness the daily life of affluent people and what they want to share. I’m not wired for that kind of Aspirational Life. There’s a danger to it. Not an edgy, sexy danger but a negligent capitalist one that I just am not able to square with. </p><p>Aspiration as negligence—I think I believe in that (and should interrogate why I follow a woman with a closet full of The Row). I recently posted on my Story about going to Costco, and every time I do this, someone thanks me for doing so—for the relatability of it, for giving them some breathing room to go get what they need in bulk.

        "description": "<p>Scores, news, and notes, from around the Detroit Tigers’ farm system for Sunday, September 11, 2022. </p> Toledo Mud Hens 6, St. Paul Saints 1 (box)\n<p>Hens pitching was on point, and a pair of home runs carried them over the Saints on Sunday. After losing three straight to start the series, including the conclusion of a suspended game, Toledo won four straight.</p>\n<p>Elvin Rodriguez allowed a solo shot in the second inning, but that was the only hit against him in four good innings of work. The bullpen was rock solid from there. </p>\n<p>Brendon Davis lined a solo shot to left in the fifth inning to tie things up. A similar shot from Davis with one out in the seventh broke the tie. Jamie Westbrook walked, Dustin Garneau was hit by a pitch, and Dylan Rosa singled in Garneau to make it 3-1. Daz Cameron put this one away in the eighth with a two run shot, and the Hens added another run before the inning was over.</p>\n<p>Davis: 3-4, 3 R, 2 RBI, 2 HR</p>\n<p>Cameron: 1-4, R, 2 RBI, HR, SO</p>\n<p>Rodriguez: 4.0 IP, ER, H, BB, 2 SO</p>\n<p>Coming Up Next: The Hens will travel to Indianapolis for six starting Tuesday night.</p>\nErie SeaWolves 6, Altoona Curve 5 (F/11)(box)\n<p>They’ll remember this game for a while in Erie. The SeaWolves fought back in a crucial game in their push for a division title and finally won it in eleven innings. Despite 13 hits to Altoona’s two hits total, this came right down to the wire.</p>\n<p>Chance Kirby was really good for the SeaWolves, spinning five dominant innings before giving up a quick strike two-run shot in the sixth. That home run gave up a SeaWolves lead, but it wouldn’t be the last time they immediately responded. </p>\n<p>Erie took an early lead when Andrew Navigato walked in the first inning, and back-to-back singles from Parker Meadows and Quincy Nieporte scored him. After Kirby allowed two runs in the top of the sixth, Luis Garcia walked with one out in the bottom half, and scored on a Bryant Packard double. Packard took third on a Navigato fly ball out, and then scored on a Meadows ground ball that went for an infield error. 2-1 Erie.</p>\n<p>However, the Curve scored a run in the seventh to tie it up, and neither team scored in the eighth and ninth. Under extra innings rules, the Curve scored a run in the top of the tenth, but the SeaWolves answered back. With Dane Myers starting on second base, Gage Workman singled and took second on the play with Myers at third. The Curve walked the bases loaded intentionally, and Daniel Cabrera lifted a fly ball that scored Myers. Unfortunately, Garcia and Packard struck out with Workman at third, sending it to the eleventh inning.</p>\n<p>A Workman error helped Altoona score in the top of the eleventh, but Yaya Chentouf shut them down from there. Navigato singled Packard from second to third to open the bottom half, and Meadows followed with a walk. An error on a Nieporte ground ball scored Packard and everyone was safe. Dane Myers lifted a fly ball to center field, and Navigato scored the game winning run. </p>\n<p>Meadows: 3-5, BB, SO</p>\n<p>Packard: 2-6, 2 R, RBI, 2B, SO</p>\n<p>Navigato: 2-5, 2 R, BB</p>\n<p>Kirby: 6.0 IP, 2 ER, H, HR, BB, 7 SO</p>\n<p>Coming Up Next: Erie’s final series of the season begins Tuesday in Richmond against the Flying Squirrels. The SeaWolves and Bowie Baysox each have six games left and are tied with a .603 winning percentage.</p>\nWest Michigan Whitecaps vs. Lake County Captains (cancelled)\n<p>Well, this is a disappointing way for the regular season. After the Whitecaps won behind another very good Jackson Jobe start on Saturday, they remained one game behind the Lake County Captains heading into the final day of the season. And...they were rained out. </p>\n<p>As a result, the Whitecaps missed the playoffs, but finish with a record of 72-59 for the 2022 season. They were 41-24 in the second half. </p>\nJupiter Hammerheads 4, Lakeland Flying Tigers 0 (box)\n<p>The Flying Tigers just didn’t get anything going in this one. As a result they dropped the final series of the 2022 season four games to two. </p>\n<p>Jordan Miller gave them a decent short start, blanking Jupiter for three innings. However, the offense managed just two hits. Cristian Santana doubled and walked as the only bright spot. J.T. Hintzen allowed three runs in 2 1⁄3 innings of work, and the Hammerheads had no trouble closing it out.</p>\n<p>Santana: 1-3, 2B, BB, SO</p>\n<p>Miller: 3.0 IP, 0 ER, 3 H, BB, 2 SO</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

This crafty lefty revived his career with the Cubs.</p> <p>On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Bleed Cubbie Blue is pleased to present a light-hearted, Cubs-centric look at baseball’s colorful past, with plenty of the lore and various narratives to follow as they unfold over the course of time. Here’s a handy Cubs timeline, to help you follow along. We also include Cubs’ player birthdays and a bit of world history, for context.</p>\n<p>Today in baseball history:</p>\n\n\n1900 - Sammy Strang, a rookie 3B, breaks in with seven hits for the Chicago Orphans in a doubleheader against the Giants. Chicago catcher Johnny Kling and Giants pitcher Win Mercer collide at the plate in the seventh inning of the second game, and Mercer is carried off the field unconscious. Chicago coasts, 9-1 in the opener, with Mercer the loser to Jock Menefee. New York takes the nightcap, 7-6, when Dummy Taylor fashions a 7-inning win over Jack Taylor. (2)\n\n1924 - Chicago’s Hack Miller hits a pinch home run in the eighth to tie the game with the Phils at six apiece. The Cubs go on to win, 10-8. (2)\n\n1930 - Brooklyn catcher Al Lopez drives one over the head of Cincinnati left fielder Bob Meusel, and the ball bounces into the bleachers at Ebbets Field. It will be the Major Leagues’ last recorded bounce home run. The National League declares after the season that such a hit will henceforth be a double. The American League had made the change after the 1929 season. (1,2)\n\n1976 - Minnie Minoso singled in three at-bats as the designated hitter for the Chicago White Sox. At age 53 he became the oldest player to get a hit in a regulation game.\n\n1998 - Cubs OF Sammy Sosa becomes the fourth player in history to reach the 60-home run mark for a season when he slugs number 60 off Valerio de los Santos of the Brewers in the seventh inning of the 15 - 12 Chicago win. (2)\n\n2000 - The Cubs’ Kerry Wood pitches his second career complete game, winning 2-1 over the Reds. Two unearned runs do in Osvaldo Fernandez. (2)\n\n<p>Cubs birthdays: John Dolan, Fred Luderus, Ralph Hamner, Bubba Church, George Freese, Carmen Pignatiello, Clayton Richard.</p>\n<p>Today in world history:</p>\n\n\n1624 - 1st submarine publicly tested in London on the Thames for King James I.\n\n1758 - French astronomer Charles Messier mistakenly identifies the Crab Nebula so begins his Messier Catalogue.\n\n1933 - Leó Szilárd, waiting for a red light on Southampton Row in Bloomsbury, conceives idea of a nuclear chain reaction.\n\n1940 - Four teens, following their dog down a hole near Lascaux, France discover 17,000 year old drawings now known as the Lascaux Cave Paintings. \n\n<p>Common sources:</p>\n\n(1) — Today in Baseball History.\n(2) — Baseball Reference.\n\n(3) — Society for American Baseball Research.\n(4) — Baseball Hall of Fame.\n(5) — This Day in Chicago Cubs history.\n\nFor world history.\n\n<p>*pictured.</p>\n<p>There is a very active baseball history community and there are many facets to their views.

        "title": "Biden administration threatens free speech with Title IX gender identity rule",
        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/education/3636741-biden-administration-threatens-free-speech-with-title-ix-gender-identity-rule/",
        "description": "<p>American campuses, which should be havens for free speech, have become infested with puritanical zealotry that does not abide dissent, especially on controversial topics such as race and gender identity. Unfortunately, free speech on campus soon may face another setback. The Department of Education has proposed a rule that would hand campus crusaders a torch and pitchfork. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rule would expand Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Title IX was enacted to prevent discrimination and harassment on college campuses, a noble goal. But the Biden administration wants to weaponize the rule to smother dissent against the sacrosanct gender theory sweeping American schools. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rule would take several steps that pose a severe threat to free speech in this hot debate. First, the rule would extend anti-discrimination and anti-harassment protections to gender identity and sexual orientation. Second, it would lower the threshold for what constitutes “harassment” to the point where it reaches even stray remarks that someone deems offensive. Right now, for speech to constitute harassment under Title IX, it must be “so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient's education program or activity.” But under the new rule, harassing speech could be either “severe” or “pervasive,” which gives more leeway to campus bureaucrats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, the rule would reach speech far outside the school environment, such that school officials could police comments on personal social media or other contexts far from the learning environment. Fourth, the rule would allow anyone to report speech and spark an investigation, enabling the most thin-skinned on campus to launch an inquisition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, the rule would censor viewpoints that go against prevailing dogma. Consider some examples. A professor declines to use a student’s preferred pronoun because of her religious beliefs. A female student expresses discomfort sharing a dorm or locker room with someone born male. A lesbian student group declines membership to a trans female. A women’s swim coach argues in an email that it’s unfair for someone born male to compete against women. A professor argues against imposing nonbinary gender constructs on ancient civilizations and remains. These people could face expulsion or termination under the rule. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the topic has changed, this drive to punish dissent calls to mind another era in which government officials abused laws to punish dissent. In the late 1800s, Puritan firebrand Anthony Comstock embarked on a crusade of speech suppression as Postmaster General, using vague “obscenity” laws to punish unpopular ideas. For instance, Comstock pushed charges against feminist Victoria Woodhull, the first woman presidential candidate, for arguing against monogamous marriage in her newspaper.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Title IX rule poses a similar risk of heretic hunting. Like protecting the young from obscenity, stopping harassment and discrimination may sound laudable. But as history shows, sheathed within this noble veneer is a blade that crusaders won’t hesitate to draw against their enemies. Already, some schools have penalized faculty and students over speech deemed transphobic. Professor Nicholas Meriwether, a philosophy professor at Shawnee State University, faced discipline when a student complained that the professor declined to use a preferred pronoun based on his religious convictions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meriwether had sought a compromise by offering to refer to the student by name only, but this did not satisfy his college’s Comstocks. And a Wisconsin school recently accused three middle schoolers of sexual harassment for using the wrong pronouns for a classmate. The appetite for Comstock crusades already exists, but the Title IX rule would give zealous college administrators a full set of dinnerware.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an important difference between harassment and causing offense. Undoubtedly, Meriwether’s choice offended some students. But a free society cannot remain free if it shields its people from hurt feelings and discomfort. Comstock had the same excuse, claiming that the “obscene” views he sought to crush would corrupt youth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why protect campus speech that offends us? For one, if we don’t, we soon may find our own speech on the chopping block when political winds shift. Plus, students — and all of us — are far better off exposed to offensive ideas than sheltered from them. As the Supreme Court stated in 2017, “[T]he proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express the thought that we hate.” But perhaps above all, free speech is a fundamental right, and to deny it to anyone — even if they say things we don’t like — is to deny it to all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethan Blevins (@ethanwb) and Alison Somin (@AlisonSomin) are attorneys at Pacific Legal Foundation, a nonprofit legal organization that defends Americans’ individual liberty and constitutional rights. </p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/morning-report/3638577-the-hills-morning-report-spending-bill-jan-6-hearings-highlight-houses-return/",
        "description": "<p>The House returns to work this week with a full plate, headlined by the push to fund the government and the resumption of hearings by the Jan. 6 committee, as part of a key monthlong stretch before the November elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a month away, the to-do list for Democratic lawmakers is straightforward: keep the government’s lights on and chalk up some more legislative wins ahead of the midterms. However, that doesn’t mean this will happen easily, as Democrats are facing a number of potential stumbling blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Topping that list is the effort by Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) to make good on his deal with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and include permitting reform language in the government spending bill, which must pass by the end of the month.  As The Hill’s Mychael Schnell notes, the permitting reform legislation would seek to expedite the development of fossil fuel and other energy products by setting maximum timelines for environmental reviews, among other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This move is much to the chagrin of progressives, who are lining up en masse against its inclusion. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday announced his opposition to the side deal struck by Schumer and Manchin that locked up the latter’s support for the Inflation Reduction Act that became law last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Sanders’s comments were simply a precursor as House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said on Friday that more than 70 House Democrats have signed on to a letter to oppose the attachment of the permitting push to the stopgap spending bill.

The first hearing could take place as early as Sept. 28.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the work of the panel has taken a back seat over the past month in the world of Trump-based investigations after the FBI’s search of the former president’s Mar-a-Lago residence and the subsequent battle between him and the Department of Justice over classified documents and sensitive material that have been seized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>▪ Politico: 16 weeks left for a heap of questions: Jan. 6 panel weighs its endgame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>▪ The Wall Street Journal: Jan. 6 panel to restart hearings as House returns to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fallout from Jan. 6 is extending in other directions as well. As The Hill’s Alexander Bolton reports, Senate Republicans — including a number of top Trump allies — are lining up against the ex-president’s promise to pardon Capitol rioters for their actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told The Hill that Trump’s pardon plan is a “bad idea.”  Other GOP lawmakers likened Trump’s call to an undeserved handout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t think potential candidates should hold pardons out as a promise,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.). “It’s somewhat problematic for me on a moral level and an ethical level — sort of like promising other giveaways to particular individuals.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, others have not dismissed it out of hand. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who led objections to the Electoral College tally in January 2021, both indicated that they are keeping an open mind and are not against leniency to those who were not involved in Capitol destruction or assaulting Capitol Police officers, among other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Let’s see which ones he would choose to do,” Hawley said of Trump’s potential pardon effort. “There’s no question it has been a massive prosecutorial effort.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related Articles</p>\n\n\n\n<p>▪ Politico: House GOP eyes its own Trump-free Jan. 6 inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>▪ The New York Times: Two former Trump political aides, Stephen Miller and Brian Jack, are among those subpoenaed in the Jan. 6 case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>▪ The Wall Street Journal: Trump lawyer Chris Kise seeks to “lower the temperature” over the Mar-a-Lago documents.

The next few weeks may determine if Florida is still a battleground state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the ballot is Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who is running for reelection with the bravado and anti-liberal themes of a politician who may launch a White House bid in 2024, and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), once a GOP presidential primary contender.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis in recent polls leads former Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.), once Florida’s Republican governor who has switched parties several times in his career and recently resigned from the House to campaign full-time. Rubio, who holds a slim advantage in surveys, is defending his Senate seat against Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the fingers-crossed among Democrats that Florida voters might be in a mood to bounce incumbents this year, Trump won Florida in 2016 and 2020, Republicans have outpaced Democrats in voter registration and Democrats struggle among Latino voters in some key parts of the state, especially South Florida.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kansas City Star: DeSantis will campaign Sunday in Kansas for Attorney General Derek Schmidt, the state’s GOP nominee for governor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the open-seat contest in Pennsylvania, Republican Mehmet Oz for weeks has badly trailed Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, his Democratic rival, in polls, forcing the celebrity doctor to try a new strategy aimed at putting Fetterman on defense over the timing and number of televised debates this fall. Meanwhile, a pro-Oz group rolled out an ad targeting Fetterman over a 2013 incident in which he pulled a gun on a Black male jogger he suspected of a crime (The Hill).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fetterman is recovering from a near-fatal stroke and heart surgery this year and concedes he has some residual “auditory processing” and speech effects, but he has agreed to debate. A Democratic win in the Keystone State would flip a seat now held by retiring Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). Several political handicappers recently shifted the Senate race to the “toss-up” category, which Democrats perceive as a favorable omen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>▪ Reuters: Fetterman on Sunday sought to allay concerns about his health during a campaign rally focused on abortion rights in suburban Philadelphia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>▪ Axios: Oz's suburban play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>▪ The Washington Post: Biden turns urgently to critical task of holding the Senate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tuesday brings another group of primary contests, this time in Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. The Hill’s Emily Brooks examines a New Hampshire House race, one of the final competitive Republican primary races of the midterm cycle, in which Rep. Chris Pappas (D-N.H.) finds himself in a proxy battle between GOP leaders and factions of his party in the Capitol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>▪ The Hill: Six primary races to watch in New Hampshire and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>▪ The Washington Post: Primary season concludes with bitterly contested GOP races in N.H.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>▪ The Hill’s Niall Stanage: Five issues that will decide the midterms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democratic candidates believe one of the most potent policy issues they’ve deployed against Republican opponents this cycle is about health, including reproductive rights and birth control, abortion and health care for women, defending coverage and costs under the Affordable Care Act, efforts to lower prescription drug prices under Medicare and under private insurance (think insulin), COVID-19 vaccines and boosters, and support for Americans dealing with mental health challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add to that list President Biden’s dedication to medical science’s long search for a cancer cure and the government’s support for research and innovative drugs and treatments to help those with the disease. It’s a “moonshot” project he spearheaded with emotion while serving as vice president, in part because his son, Beau Biden, died in 2015 of incurable brain cancer.

The procession first stopped in Edinburgh after passing mourners who packed city streets and highway bridges or lined rural roads with cars and tractors to take part in a historic goodbye to the monarch, according to The Associated Press.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think she has been an ever-constant in my life,” Angus Ruthven, a civil servant from Edinburgh, told The Associated Press. “She was the queen I was born under, and she has always been there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This morning, the queen’s coffin sits in St. Giles’ Cathedral, where it will lie in state for 24 hours (The Associated Press). Meanwhile, King Charles III on Monday morning addressed parliament at Westminster Hall (The New York Times).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The casket on Tuesday will be flown to London aboard a Royal Air Force jet. “It will be loaded into a state hearse and driven to Buckingham Palace, arriving at 8 p.m., when it will be placed on a trestle in the ballroom,” The New York Times reports. It will then be transported in a silent procession on Wednesday to Westminster Hall, where the queen’s remains will lie in state for four days after receiving a blessing from the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Funeral attendance is expected to be in the tens of thousands or more, although Buckingham Palace has not commented on the number of dignitaries, officials and members of the House of Windsor expected to attend the historic event (The New York Times).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among those beloved by the queen and left behind are her dogs, whose futures are chronicled by the news media and whose canine lineage has been amply tracked in photographs since the 1950s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her majesty’s corgis, Muick and Sandy, will reside with her son, Andrew, the Duke of York, and his ex-wife Sarah, the Duchess of York.

Ukraine regained control of the Kherson, a region that Russia swiftly took hold of in the early days of the war, and made headway in Kharkiv, where Russia ordered a troop drawback. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address on Saturday that the nation has recaptured more than 770 square miles of territory this month alone and mocked the Russian army, saying it was “demonstrating the best it can do — showing its back” (The Associated Press).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant announced on Sunday that it was shutting down its final working nuclear reactor because of continued shelling in the area. Energoatom, the nuclear operator, said in a statement that while the plant has been reconnected to the nation’s electric grid, one reactor was being powered down to allow it to cool. The entire plant had been cut off from the grid in recent days, with the lone working reactor operating on “island mode” to allow cooling systems to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these moves have been made to ensure a nuclear meltdown is avoided. The largest nuclear plant in Europe is staffed by Ukrainian workers, includes on-site experts sent from the International Atomic Energy Agency and is being held as a fortress of war by Russian forces (The Associated Press).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plant’s strains were among issues discussed during a Sunday meeting between French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

They claim that the test could also simplify screening for other cancers, and save lives by eliminating invasive colonoscopies for colorectal cancer, which many patients are afraid of and skip (Times of Israel).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Too much processed food shortens lives. ​​Two recent studies added to the body of science that has affirmed that conclusion. One test published in the British Medical Journal and backed up by the American Cancer Society found an increased risk of colorectal cancer for men in the top fifth of ultra-processed diets in the U.S. The other study found that preservative-laden foods were linked to early death, especially from heart disease. The latest evidence against ultra-processed foods — a category that includes hot dogs, potato chips, and frozen pizza — shows that consuming too many unhealthy snacks increases the risk of colon and rectal cancer for men, as well as premature death due to heart disease for both men and women (Yahoo News).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>COVID-19 illnesses are keeping half a million workers out of the U.S. labor force, according to a new study, and if the trend continues, the impact on employment will not abate anytime soon (The Wall Street Journal).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Total U.S. coronavirus deaths reported as of this morning, according to Johns Hopkins University (trackers all vary slightly): 1,050,323. Current average U.S. COVID-19 daily deaths are 318, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>➤ SPORTS</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carlos Alcaraz, 19, on Sunday became the first teenager to win a Grand Slam title in 17 years when he won the U.S. Open in Flushing Meadow, N.Y. Alcaraz of Spain defeated Casper Ruud of Norway 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (1), 6-3 to nab the first of what could be many career Grand Slam championships ahead for him. Alcaraz also earned the world No. 1 ranking after winning his fifth tournament of the season. “Well, this is something that I dreamed of since I was a kid,” said Alcaraz, who captured the championship after winning his previous three matches in five sets. “It's something I worked really, really hard [for]. It's tough to talk right now. A lot of emotions” (ESPN).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>THE CLOSER</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally … “So many heroes were made here,” Biden said Sunday while honoring 9/11 victims and families during a wreath-laying ceremony that marked the 21st anniversary of the terror attacks (The Hill). “So many of your loved ones were those heroes,” the president said while laying a wreath at the Pentagon under rainy skies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The president was a Delaware senator during the 2001 tragedy at the World Trade Center towers, at the Defense Department across the Potomac River from the nation’s capital, and in Shanksville, Pa., when a hijacked commercial jetliner crashed in a field, killing the terrorists and passengers. The events that day led the United States into war in Iraq and Afghanistan.

About 15,000 nurses from the union are participating in the strike. </p><p>Earlier this month, the union said 16 hospitals were expected to be part of the strike. On Monday, though, staff at 15 hospitals struck while nurses at the Essentia hospital in Moose Lake, Minn., chose to conduct an informational picket.</p>Thousands picket outside hospitals<p>In August, union members voted to authorize a strike. The union is required to provide hospital officials 10 days notice before walking off the job, which they did in a press conference on Sept. 1. </p><p>Just before 7 a.m. Monday, a group of nurses and others are gathered at Stewart Park across the street from Abbott Northwestern in Minneapolis. It's the hub where people will sign in, grab a union T-shirt and a sign, and prepare to get out on the picket line during the strike. </p><p>Before they headed out, one member with a bullhorn led the group in a chant: “When I say nurses you say power. Nurses. Power! Nurses. Power! When I say contract you say now. Contract. Now! Contract. Now!”</p><p>People driving by honked their horns in support of the nurses.</p><p>\"The most important thing for us is safe staffing. And we have proposals on the table to have nurses have a say in how things go. We do the work … we're the ones that take care of the patients. We need a say in how things go,\" said Tricia Ryshkus, a nurse at Children's Minnesota in Minneapolis and a member of the Minnesota Nurses Association negotiating team. </p><p>Ryshkus worked Sunday night at the hospital, but joined her colleagues picketing outside Abbott Northwestern on Monday morning.</p><p>\"We don't want the pandemic, the short staffing and all the things, to be our new normal. We can't do that anymore. It's not fair to us. It's not fair to our patients.\"</p><p>Elected officials joined the picket line, including State Rep. Tina Liebling of Rochester.</p><p>“This is about all of us. This is about our loved ones. This is about our families, our friends, our communities. We need to be listening to the voices of nurses. They are at the bedside,” Liebling said. </p><p>Hundreds of nurses also picketed outside Essentia Health in downtown Duluth.</p><p>Natasha Thomas, a cardiac nurse at Essentia Health, said she cried on her way home from work late Sunday night. She said the hospital's chronically short staffing problems were exacerbated by the pandemic. </p><p>\"None of us want to be out here. We want to be inside with our patients. We want to make sure that they're safe. That's our job. That's what we we decided to do with our profession. That's what we love to do,” Thomas said.</p>Nurses concerned about hospital staffing levels<p>Union leaders have described staffing levels at hospitals as being at crisis levels following two years of dealing with the pandemic.</p><p>Mary Forbes, a registered nurse at Abbott Northwestern, said many of her colleagues have chosen to become travel nurses and that hospital systems have not provided the needed incentives to keep people in place.</p><p>Forbes said staffing is the most important issue to her and addressing it would keep her at patients’ bedsides for years to come. “I'm 28 and my back hurts and patients yell at me and their family members yell at me and it's just not sustainable.\"</p><p>Union leaders reiterated that point during a noon news conference Monday. Mary Turner, president of the Minnesota Nurses Association, told reporters that the union wants hospitals to have to get majority approval from nurses on a hospital floor before making any staffing changes. </p><p>Nurses want the “ability to have some say in the staffing on our floors. We’re being denied that,” Turner said.</p>What’s next for negotiations<p>Turner on Sunday told WCCO-TV that some bargaining teams met with hospital management through the weekend, lasting until early Sunday morning. Others held sessions last week. </p><p>She noted that at least one of the nurse negotiating teams offered to slightly reduce its demand for a 30 percent wage increase over three years. Hospitals are offering around 10 percent increases over the same time period.</p><p>In a statement, the Twin Cities Hospitals Group, which represents many of those impacted by the walkout, said they're disappointed in the nurses' decision to strike. They said nurses should've sought out mediation, and called their wage demands — about thirty percent over three years — unrealistic.</p><p>Asked what happens Thursday if the three-day strike ends without a deal, Turner told reporters that nurses would return to work and continue the contract fight, adding the union hoped the three-day walkout would be enough to bring the hospitals back to the bargaining table.</p>Hospitals say they will maintain high level of care through strike<p>Multiple hospitals hired temporary nurses to cover staffing schedules during the strike. </p><p>Hospital officials said they will continue to accept patients, but said there may be some delays. They're asking people to see their primary care provider, urgent care or use telehealth options when possible. They also said the state health department is monitoring care in their facilities.</p><p>In a statement Monday, officials with Allina Health said it “continues to be focused on delivering safe, reliable care” and that “our teams have rescheduled a limited number of non-emergent appointments” to keep up. Allina Health also said “strikes do not benefit anyone” and that it hopes the union will resume negotiations after the strike with the help of a federal mediator.</p><p>On its website, St. Luke’s in Duluth said, “We will continue to offer all services and will be fully open for all inpatient, emergency and clinic-based care, although we may reschedule some non-urgent surgeries and procedures. Patients should arrive as scheduled unless they hear differently from their provider.”</p>Nurses prepare to strike outside of Abbott Northwestern on the first day of a three-day strike.Michelle Wiley | MPR News<p>The union said these are the hospitals and systems impacted by the strike.

        "description": "Voters cast their ballots at a polling station setup in a fire station on August 23, 2022 in Miami Beach, Florida.Joe Raedle/Getty Images<p>With two months to go until the midterms, tech companies are getting ready: rolling out fact checks, labeling misleading claims and setting up voting guides.</p><p>The election playbooks being used by Facebook, Twitter, Google-owned YouTube and TikTok are largely in line with those they used in 2020, when they warned that both foreign and domestic actors were seeking to undermine confidence in the results.</p><p>But the wave of falsehoods in the wake of that election — including the \"big lie\" that Donald Trump won — has continued to spread, espoused by hundreds of Republican candidates on ballots this fall.</p><p>That's left experts who study social media wondering what lessons tech companies have learned from 2020 — and whether they are doing enough this year.</p><p>The host of election-related announcements in recent weeks add up to a \"business as usual\" approach, said Katie Harbath, a former elections policy director at Facebook who's now a fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center.</p>The return of familiar playbooks<p>The platforms are largely taking a two-pronged approach: tamping down misleading or outright false claims, and boosting authoritative information from local election officials and reputable news sources.</p><p>In the first case, all four major platforms are leaning on labels to flag falsehoods and, in many cases, direct users to fact checks or accurate information. In some cases, users won't be able to share labeled posts and the platforms themselves won't recommend them. YouTube, Facebook and TikTok also say they will remove some specific false claims about voting and threats of violence.</p><p>Platforms are often hesitant to spell out exactly how they enforce their policies to avoid giving bad actors a roadmap. The range of approaches to labeling and removal also illustrates the fraught balance the companies try to strike between letting users express themselves and protecting their platforms from being weaponized — all while facing scrutiny from politicians on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>Policies diverge most when it comes to political ads. Twitter and TikTok have banned ads for candidates and about political issues. Google and Facebook both allow them, requiring disclosure of who pays for them. Facebook is once again freezing all new political ads in the week before Election Day but will allow existing ads to continue running.</p><p>But defining when an ad or issue qualifies as political isn't straightforward, leaving gaps that experts worry could be exploited.</p><p>\"It's actually a quite confusing landscape because there is no regulation, there are no standards these companies have to follow,\" Harbath said. \"Everyone is just making the choices that they feel are best for them and their company.\"</p><p>On the flip side, all four platforms are highlighting features that aim to put more reliable information in users' feeds, such as providing information about candidates, voter registration and when and where to cast ballots. That information will also be available in Spanish across platforms.</p><p>Branching out beyond English is an important step towards addressing a \"glaring omission\" in previous elections, said Zeve Sanderson, executive director of New York University's Center for Media and Politics.</p><p>In the final days of the 2020 election, Latino voters were targeted with social media posts discouraging them from voting, according to voting rights activists and disinformation experts.</p>Evidence is mixed on how well platform policies work<p>Even as social media companies double down on their 2020 tactics, researchers say it's not always clear how effective their interventions are.</p><p>In the case of labels, there is mixed evidence about whether they help dispel false impressions, or if, in some cases, they may inadvertently encourage people to double down on those beliefs.</p><p>Last year, researchers at NYU analyzed what happened after Twitter labeled some of Trump's tweets before and after the 2020 election as containing misinformation. They found the labeled messages spread even further on Twitter, and also took off on other platforms including Facebook, Instagram and Reddit.</p><p>The platforms have given small peeks into what they know about how well their tools work. Twitter has said after it redesigned its misleading information labels last year, more people clicked through to read accurate information.</p><p>Facebook, meanwhile, says it will be more choosy about what it labels, after users said labels were \"over-used\" in 2020. \"In the event that we do need to deploy them this time round our intention is to do so in a targeted and strategic way,\" Nick Clegg, president of global affairs at Facebook parent Meta, wrote in a blog post.</p><p>But for NYU's Sanderson, that raised more questions the company has not answered.</p><p>\"What was the feedback? From which users? What do the words 'targeted' and 'strategic' mean?\" he said. \"It would be really helpful for them to contextualize it within actual details of what their internal research has found.\"</p>Pro-Trump protesters gather in front of the U.S. Capitol Building on January 6, 2021.Brent Stirton/Getty ImagesMoving beyond misinformation \"Whac-A-Mole\"<p>What's more, it's hard to know how well the companies enforce their policies — which Harbath, the former Facebook official, described as a \"huge gap.\"</p><p>\"The companies are like, 'These are our policies, these are all the things that we're going to do.' But they don't talk enough about, 'Okay, but humans are fallible. The technology is not 100 percent perfect,'\" she said.</p><p>In the hours after polls closed in 2020, Trump supporters began rallying online under the slogan \"Stop the Steal,\" Facebook removed the first Stop the Steal group on its platform quickly, under its rules against casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election and calling for violence. But more groups kept popping up — and Facebook was unable to keep up.</p><p>Researchers warn that the 2020 approach to election falsehoods doesn't address the reality of 2022. Tech companies approach elections as discrete events, typically putting policies in place and then turning them off when the voting is over — even though false claims don't end when the ballots are counted.</p><p>\"The companies should be doing a lot more to have an always-on policy, because clearly these topics around the integrity of elections are certainly staying in the lexicon and the conversation well beyond Election Day,\" Harbath said.</p><p>The big challenge is for companies to move beyond being reactive and find ways to prevent their platforms from being used to spread these kinds of falsehoods so widely in the first place.</p><p>\"When it comes to election misinformation and disinformation, platforms are kind of just playing Whac-A-Mole — trying to get on top of something before something else arises,\" said Spandi Singh, a policy analyst at the Open Technology Institute at the think tank New America.</p><p>Editor's note: Facebook parent Meta pays NPR to license NPR content.  </p><p>Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "<p>On March 25, 2020, Hannah Davis was texting with two friends when she realized that she couldn’t understand one of their messages. In hindsight, that was the first sign that she had COVID-19. It was also her first experience with the phenomenon known as “brain fog,” and the moment when her old life contracted into her current one. She once worked in artificial intelligence and analyzed complex systems without hesitation, but now “runs into a mental wall” when faced with tasks as simple as filling out forms. Her memory, once vivid, feels frayed and fleeting. Former mundanities—buying food, making meals, cleaning up—can be agonizingly difficult. Her inner world—what she calls “the extras of thinking, like daydreaming, making plans, imagining”—is gone. The fog “is so encompassing,” she told me, “it affects every area of my life.” For more than 900 days, while other long-COVID symptoms have waxed and waned, her brain fog has never really lifted.</p><p>Of long COVID’s many possible symptoms, brain fog “is by far one of the most disabling and destructive,” Emma Ladds, a primary-care specialist from the University of Oxford, told me. It’s also among the most misunderstood. It wasn’t even included in the list of possible COVID symptoms when the coronavirus pandemic first began. But 20 to 30 percent of patients report brain fog three months after their initial infection, as do 65 to 85 percent of the long-haulers who stay sick for much longer. It can afflict people who were never ill enough to need a ventilator—or any hospital care. And it can affect young people in the prime of their mental lives.  </p><p>Long-haulers with brain fog say that it’s like none of the things that people—including many medical professionals—jeeringly compare it to. It is more profound than the clouded thinking that accompanies hangovers, stress, or fatigue. For Davis, it has been distinct from and worse than her experience with ADHD. It is not psychosomatic, and involves real changes to the structure and chemistry of the brain. It is not a mood disorder: “If anyone is saying that this is due to depression and anxiety, they have no basis for that, and data suggest it might be the other direction,” Joanna Hellmuth, a neurologist at UC San Francisco, told me.</p><p>And despite its nebulous name, brain fog is not an umbrella term for every possible mental problem. At its core, Hellmuth said, it is almost always a disorder of “executive function”—the set of mental abilities that includes focusing attention, holding information in mind, and blocking out distractions. These skills are so foundational that when they crumble, much of a person’s cognitive edifice collapses. Anything involving concentration, multitasking, and planning—that is, almost everything important—becomes absurdly arduous. “It raises what are unconscious processes for healthy people to the level of conscious decision making,” Fiona Robertson, a writer based in Aberdeen, Scotland, told me.</p><p>For example, Robertson’s brain often loses focus mid-sentence, leading to what she jokingly calls “so-yeah syndrome”: “I forget what I’m saying, tail off, and go, ‘So, yeah …’” she said. Brain fog stopped Kristen Tjaden from driving, because she’d forget her destination en route. For more than a year, she couldn’t read, either, because making sense of a series of words had become too difficult. Angela Meriquez Vázquez told me it once took her two hours to schedule a meeting over email: She’d check her calendar, but the information would slip in the second it took to bring up her inbox. At her worst, she couldn’t unload a dishwasher, because identifying an object, remembering where it should go, and putting it there was too complicated.</p><p>Memory suffers, too, but in a different way from degenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s. The memories are there, but with executive function malfunctioning, the brain neither chooses the important things to store nor retrieves that information efficiently. Davis, who is part of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, can remember facts from scientific papers, but not events. When she thinks of her loved ones, or her old life, they feel distant. “Moments that affected me don’t feel like they’re part of me anymore,” she said. “It feels like I am a void and I’m living in a void.”</p><p>Most people with brain fog are not so severely affected, and gradually improve with time. But even when people recover enough to work, they can struggle with minds that are less nimble than before. “We’re used to driving a sports car, and now we are left with a jalopy,” Vázquez said. In some professions, a jalopy won’t cut it. “I’ve had surgeons who can’t go back to surgery, because they need their executive function,” Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez, a rehabilitation specialist at UT Health San Antonio, told me.</p><p>Robertson, meanwhile, was studying theoretical physics in college when she first got sick, and her fog occluded a career path that was once brightly lit. “I used to sparkle, like I could pull these things together and start to see how the universe works,” she told me. “I’ve never been able to access that sensation again, and I miss it, every day, like an ache.” That loss of identity was as disruptive as the physical aspects of the disease, which “I always thought I could deal with … if I could just think properly,” Robertson said. “This is the thing that’s destabilized me most.”</p><p>Robertson predicted that the pandemic would trigger a wave of cognitive impairment in March 2020. Her brain fog began two decades earlier, likely with a different viral illness, but she developed the same executive-function impairments that long-haulers experience, which then worsened when she got COVID last year. That specific constellation of problems also befalls many people living with HIV, epileptics after seizures, cancer patients experiencing so-called chemo brain, and people with several complex chronic illnesses such as fibromyalgia. It’s part of the diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS—a condition that Davis and many other long-haulers now have. Brain fog existed well before COVID, affecting many people whose conditions were stigmatized, dismissed, or neglected. “For all of those years, people just treated it like it’s not worth researching,” Robertson told me. “So many of us were told, Oh, it’s just a bit of a depression.”</p><p>Several clinicians I spoke with argued that the term brain fog makes the condition sound like a temporary inconvenience and deprives patients of the legitimacy that more medicalized language like cognitive impairment would bestow. But Aparna Nair, a historian of disability at the University of Oklahoma, noted that disability communities have used the term for decades, and there are many other reasons behind brain fog’s dismissal beyond terminology. (A surfeit of syllables didn’t stop fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis from being trivialized.)</p><p>For example, Hellmuth noted that in her field of cognitive neurology, “virtually all the infrastructure and teaching” centers on degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, in which rogue proteins afflict elderly brains. Few researchers know that viruses can cause cognitive disorders in younger people, so few study their effects. “As a result, no one learns about it in medical school,” Hellmuth said. And because “there’s not a lot of humility in medicine, people end up blaming patients instead of looking for answers,” she said.</p><p>People with brain fog also excel at hiding it: None of the long-haulers I’ve interviewed sounded cognitively impaired. But at times when her speech is obviously sluggish, “nobody except my husband and mother see me,” Robertson said. The stigma that long-haulers experience also motivates them to present as normal in social situations or doctor appointments, which compounds the mistaken sense that they’re less impaired than they claim—and can be debilitatingly draining. “They’ll do what is asked of them when you’re testing them, and your results will say they were normal,” David Putrino, who leads a long-COVID rehabilitation clinic at Mount Sinai, told me. “It’s only if you check in on them two days later that you’ll see you’ve wrecked them for a week.”</p><p>“We also don’t have the right tools for measuring brain fog,” Putrino said. Doctors often use the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, which was designed to uncover extreme mental problems in elderly people with dementia, and “isn’t validated for anyone under age 55,” Hellmuth told me. Even a person with severe brain fog can ace it. More sophisticated tests exist, but they still compare people with the population average rather than their previous baseline. “A high-functioning person with a decline in their abilities who falls within the normal range is told they don’t have a problem,” Hellmuth said.</p><p>This pattern exists for many long-COVID symptoms: Doctors order inappropriate or overly simplistic tests, whose negative results are used to discredit patients’ genuine symptoms. It doesn’t help that brain fog (and long COVID more generally) disproportionately affects women, who have a long history of being labeled as emotional or hysterical by the medical establishment. But every patient with brain fog “tells me the exact same story of executive-function symptoms,” Hellmuth said. “If people were making this up, the clinical narrative wouldn’t be the same.”</p><p>Earlier this year, a team of British researchers rendered the invisible nature of brain fog in the stark black-and-white imagery of MRI scans. Gwenaëlle Douaud at the University of Oxford and her colleagues analyzed data from the UK Biobank study, which had regularly scanned the brains of hundreds of volunteers for years prior to the pandemic. When some of those volunteers caught COVID, the team could compare their after scans to the before ones. They found that even mild infections can slightly shrink the brain and reduce the thickness of its neuron-rich gray matter. At their worst, these changes were comparable to a decade of aging. They were especially pronounced in areas such as the parahippocampal gyrus, which is important for encoding and retrieving memories, and the orbitofrontal cortex, which is important for executive function. They were still apparent in people who hadn’t been hospitalized. And they were accompanied by cognitive problems.</p><p>Although SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID, can enter and infect the central nervous system, it doesn’t do so efficiently, persistently, or frequently, Michelle Monje, a neuro-oncologist at Stanford, told me. Instead, she thinks that in most cases the virus harms the brain without directly infecting it. She and her colleagues recently showed that when mice experience mild bouts of COVID, inflammatory chemicals can travel from the lungs to the brain, where they disrupt cells called microglia. Normally, microglia act as groundskeepers, supporting neurons by pruning unnecessary connections and cleaning unwanted debris. When inflamed, their efforts become overenthusiastic and destructive. In their presence, the hippocampus—a region crucial for memory—produces fewer fresh neurons, while many existing neurons lose their insulating coats, so electric signals now course along these cells more slowly. These are the same changes that Monje sees in cancer patients with “chemo fog.” And although she and her team did their COVID experiments in mice, they found high levels of the same inflammatory chemicals in long-haulers with brain fog.</p><p>Monje suspects that neuro-inflammation is “probably the most common way” that COVID results in brain fog, but that there are likely many such routes. COVID could possibly trigger autoimmune problems in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the nervous system, or reactivate dormant viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus, which has been linked to conditions including ME/CFS and multiple sclerosis. By damaging blood vessels and filling them with small clots, COVID also throttles the brain’s blood supply, depriving this most energetically demanding of organs of oxygen and fuel. This oxygen shortfall isn’t stark enough to kill neurons or send people to an ICU, but “the brain isn’t getting what it needs to fire on all cylinders,” Putrino told me. (The severe oxygen deprivation that forces some people with COVID into critical care causes different cognitive problems than what most long-haulers experience.)</p><p>None of these explanations is set in stone, but they can collectively make sense of brain fog’s features. A lack of oxygen would affect sophisticated and energy-dependent cognitive tasks first, which explains why executive function and language “are the first ones to go,” Putrino said. Without insulating coats, neurons work more slowly, which explains why many long-haulers feel that their processing speed is shot: “You’re losing the thing that facilitates fast neural connection between brain regions,” Monje said. These problems can be exacerbated or mitigated by factors such as sleep and rest, which explains why many people with brain fog have good days and bad days. And although other respiratory viruses can wreak inflammatory havoc on the brain, SARS-CoV-2 does so more potently than, say, influenza, which explains both why people such as Robertson developed brain fog long before the current pandemic and why the symptom is especially prominent among COVID long-haulers.</p><p>Perhaps the most important implication of this emerging science is that brain fog is “potentially reversible,” Monje said. If the symptom was the work of a persistent brain infection, or the mass death of neurons following severe oxygen starvation, it would be hard to undo. But neuroinflammation isn’t destiny. Cancer researchers, for example, have developed drugs that can calm berserk microglia in mice and restore their cognitive abilities; some are being tested in early clinical trials. “I’m hopeful that we’ll find the same to be true in COVID,” she said.</p><p>Biomedical advances might take years to arrive, but long-haulers need help with brain fog now. Absent cures, most approaches to treatment are about helping people manage their symptoms. Sounder sleep, healthy eating, and other generic lifestyle changes can make the condition more tolerable. Breathing and relaxation techniques can help people through bad flare-ups; speech therapy can help those with problems finding words. Some over-the-counter medications such as antihistamines can ease inflammatory symptoms, while stimulants can boost lagging concentration.</p><p>“Some people spontaneously recover back to baseline,” Hellmuth told me, “but two and a half years on, a lot of patients I see are no better.” And between these extremes lies perhaps the largest group of long-haulers—those whose brain fog has improved but not vanished, and who can “maintain a relatively normal life, but only after making serious accommodations,” Putrino said. Long recovery periods and a slew of lifehacks make regular living possible, but more slowly and at higher cost.</p><p>Kristen Tjaden can read again, albeit for short bursts followed by long rests, but hasn’t returned to work. Angela Meriquez Vázquez can work but can’t multitask or process meetings in real time. Julia Moore Vogel, who helps lead a large biomedical research program, can muster enough executive function for her job, but “almost everything else in my life I’ve cut out to make room for that,” she told me. “I only leave the house or socialize once a week.” And she rarely talks about these problems openly because “in my field, your brain is your currency,” she said. “I know my value in many people’s eyes will be diminished by knowing that I have these cognitive challenges.”</p><p>Patients struggle to make peace with how much they’ve changed and the stigma associated with it, regardless of where they end up. Their desperation to return to normal can be dangerous, especially when combined with cultural norms around pressing on through challenges and post-exertional malaise—severe crashes in which all symptoms worsen after even minor physical or mental exertion. Many long-haulers try to push themselves back to work and instead “push themselves into a crash,” Robertson told me. When she tried to force her way to normalcy, she became mostly housebound for a year, needing full-time care. Even now, if she tries to concentrate in the middle of a bad day, “I end up with a physical reaction of exhaustion and pain, like I’ve run a marathon,” she said.</p><p>Post-exertional malaise is so common among long-haulers that “exercise as a treatment is inappropriate for people with long COVID,” Putrino said. Even brain-training games—which have questionable value but are often mentioned as potential treatments for brain fog—must be very carefully rationed because mental exertion is physical exertion. People with ME/CFS learned this lesson the hard way, and fought hard to get exercise therapy, once commonly prescribed for the condition, to be removed from official guidance in the U.S. and U.K. They’ve also learned the value of pacing—carefully sensing and managing their energy levels to avoid crashes.</p><p>Vogel does this with a wearable that tracks her heart rate, sleep, activity, and stress as a proxy for her energy levels; if they feel low, she forces herself to rest—cognitively as well as physically. Checking social media or responding to emails do not count. In those moments, “you have to accept that you have this medical crisis and the best thing you can do is literally nothing,” she said. When stuck in a fog, sometimes the only option is to stand still.</p>",

        "description": "I know how you feel, Ryan Mountcastle | Photo by Greg Fiume/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Things are pretty dismal in Birdland right now, but still we press on.</p> <p>Happy Monday, Camden Chatters! </p>\n<p>Well, things have sure gone south in a hurry for the Orioles. After losing three of four to the Blue Jays, they needed to make a statement against the last place Red Sox. They did not, though. Unless that statement is that they are, as a team, fading about as fast as they can. After a win on Friday night, the pitching lost all control on Saturday as they gave up 17 runs. Then yesterday they got great pitching from Kyle Bradish but couldn’t score a single run. </p>\n<p>So now what? The Orioles start the week 5.5 games behind the Blue Jays for the final wild card spot and six games behind Rays and Mariners for the other two. They now have just 22 games remaining in the 2022 season. </p>\n<p>The good news is that, after an off day today, the Orioles get to play two games against the actual worst team in baseball, the Washington Nationals. They then have another off day on Thursday to travel to Toronto for three games against the Blue Jays. The Jays, meanwhile, are playing five games in four days against the Rays. </p>\n<p>The best case scenario is that the Orioles sweep the Nationals while the Rays pull off an incredible five-game sweep of the Jays. That would send the Orioles into Toronto just two games behind the Jays. </p>\n<p>Do I think this will happen? No, I do not. I think the Orioles are pretty much toast. But I’ll keep hoping, just in case. </p>\n<p>Links</p>\n<p>Orioles' offense continues to falter in 1-0 loss to Red Sox; Only 3 hits in 6th loss in 8 games; Bautista talks about arm fatigue - BaltimoreBaseball.comRich Dubroff has the game quotes from yesterday's loss as well as good news about Félix Bautista's arm (it feels good).</p>\n<p>Rutschman lives up to billing - MASN SportsLet's take a break from feeling sad about the state of the team to read praise of Adley Rutschman, courtesy of Roch Kubatko.</p>\n<p>Orioles Claim Cam Gallagher, Designate Rico Garcia - MLB Trade RumorsCam Gallagher is a catcher who worked as Salvador Perez's backup from 2017 until he was traded to the Padres as the deadline. Now he has been claimed by the Orioles and optioned to Norfolk. He is a strong defensive catcher. Will his backup work continue next season?</p>\n<p>Birthdays and History</p>\n<p>Is today your birthday? Happy birthday! You have four Orioles birthday buddies, including current Oriole Kyle Bradish. Bradish turns 26 years old today and despite him pitching seven innings with just one run allowed yesterday, his teammates weren’t interested in giving him a win as a gift. </p>\n<p>It’s also the birthday of Keith Hughes (59), who played in 41 games for the 1988 Orioles; Mark Thurmond (66), a pitcher who appeared in 92 games with the Orioles from 1988-89; and Albie Pearson (88), whose nine year major league career included 128 games with the Orioles from 1959-60. </p>\n<p>On this day in 1964, both Baltimore’s Frank Bertaina and Kansas City’s Bob Meyer pitched complete game one hitters. The good news is that the Orioles were able to get one run thanks the one hit being a double, followed by a bunt and a sac fly. Orioles won, 1-0. </p>\n<p>In 1988, Eddie Murray got his 2,000th career hit. He achieved the 3,000 mark in 1995 with Cleveland. </p>\n<p>In 2009, the Orioles defeated the Yankees 7-3 thanks in large part to Brian Roberts’s second-inning grand slam. Roberts also hit his 51st double of the season to set a club record. The winning pitcher was Brian Matusz, who gave up just one run in seven innings. </p>\n<p>In 2014, the Orioles swept a doubleheader with the Yankees, yay! But Chris Davis was suspended for 25 games after testing positive for amphetamines, boo.   </p>",

        "description": "<p>On March 25, 2020, Hannah Davis was texting with two friends when she realized that she couldn’t understand one of their messages. In hindsight, that was the first sign that she had COVID-19. It was also her first experience with the phenomenon known as “brain fog,” and the moment when her old life contracted into her current one. She once worked in artificial intelligence and analyzed complex systems without hesitation, but now “runs into a mental wall” when faced with tasks as simple as filling out forms. Her memory, once vivid, feels frayed and fleeting. Former mundanities—buying food, making meals, cleaning up—can be agonizingly difficult. Her inner world—what she calls “the extras of thinking, like daydreaming, making plans, imagining”—is gone. The fog “is so encompassing,” she told me, “it affects every area of my life.” For more than 900 days, while other long-COVID symptoms have waxed and waned, her brain fog has never really lifted.</p><p>Of long COVID’s many possible symptoms, brain fog “is by far one of the most disabling and destructive,” Emma Ladds, a primary-care specialist from the University of Oxford, told me. It’s also among the most misunderstood. It wasn’t even included in the list of possible COVID symptoms when the coronavirus pandemic first began. But 20 to 30 percent of patients report brain fog three months after their initial infection, as do 65 to 85 percent of the long-haulers who stay sick for much longer. It can afflict people who were never ill enough to need a ventilator—or any hospital care. And it can affect young people in the prime of their mental lives.  </p><p>Long-haulers with brain fog say that it’s like none of the things that people—including many medical professionals—jeeringly compare it to. It is more profound than the clouded thinking that accompanies hangovers, stress, or fatigue. For Davis, it has been distinct from and worse than her experience with ADHD. It is not psychosomatic, and involves real changes to the structure and chemistry of the brain. It is not a mood disorder: “If anyone is saying that this is due to depression and anxiety, they have no basis for that, and data suggest it might be the other direction,” Joanna Hellmuth, a neurologist at UC San Francisco, told me.</p><p>And despite its nebulous name, brain fog is not an umbrella term for every possible mental problem. At its core, Hellmuth said, it is almost always a disorder of “executive function”—the set of mental abilities that includes focusing attention, holding information in mind, and blocking out distractions. These skills are so foundational that when they crumble, much of a person’s cognitive edifice collapses. Anything involving concentration, multitasking, and planning—that is, almost everything important—becomes absurdly arduous. “It raises what are unconscious processes for healthy people to the level of conscious decision making,” Fiona Robertson, a writer based in Aberdeen, Scotland, told me.</p><p>For example, Robertson’s brain often loses focus mid-sentence, leading to what she jokingly calls “so-yeah syndrome”: “I forget what I’m saying, tail off, and go, ‘So, yeah …’” she said. Brain fog stopped Kristen Tjaden from driving, because she’d forget her destination en route. For more than a year, she couldn’t read, either, because making sense of a series of words had become too difficult. Angela Meriquez Vázquez told me it once took her two hours to schedule a meeting over email: She’d check her calendar, but the information would slip in the second it took to bring up her inbox. At her worst, she couldn’t unload a dishwasher, because identifying an object, remembering where it should go, and putting it there was too complicated.</p><p>Memory suffers, too, but in a different way from degenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s. The memories are there, but with executive function malfunctioning, the brain neither chooses the important things to store nor retrieves that information efficiently. Davis, who is part of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, can remember facts from scientific papers, but not events. When she thinks of her loved ones, or her old life, they feel distant. “Moments that affected me don’t feel like they’re part of me anymore,” she said. “It feels like I am a void and I’m living in a void.”</p><p>Most people with brain fog are not so severely affected, and gradually improve with time. But even when people recover enough to work, they can struggle with minds that are less nimble than before. “We’re used to driving a sports car, and now we are left with a jalopy,” Vázquez said. In some professions, a jalopy won’t cut it. “I’ve had surgeons who can’t go back to surgery, because they need their executive function,” Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez, a rehabilitation specialist at UT Health San Antonio, told me.</p><p>Robertson, meanwhile, was studying theoretical physics in college when she first got sick, and her fog occluded a career path that was once brightly lit. “I used to sparkle, like I could pull these things together and start to see how the universe works,” she told me. “I’ve never been able to access that sensation again, and I miss it, every day, like an ache.” That loss of identity was as disruptive as the physical aspects of the disease, which “I always thought I could deal with … if I could just think properly,” Robertson said. “This is the thing that’s destabilized me most.”</p><p>Robertson predicted that the pandemic would trigger a wave of cognitive impairment in March 2020. Her brain fog began two decades earlier, likely with a different viral illness, but she developed the same executive-function impairments that long-haulers experience, which then worsened when she got COVID last year. That specific constellation of problems also befalls many people living with HIV, epileptics after seizures, cancer patients experiencing so-called chemo brain, and people with several complex chronic illnesses such as fibromyalgia. It’s part of the diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS—a condition that Davis and many other long-haulers now have. Brain fog existed well before COVID, affecting many people whose conditions were stigmatized, dismissed, or neglected. “For all of those years, people just treated it like it’s not worth researching,” Robertson told me. “So many of us were told, Oh, it’s just a bit of a depression.”</p><p>Several clinicians I spoke with argued that the term brain fog makes the condition sound like a temporary inconvenience and deprives patients of the legitimacy that more medicalized language like cognitive impairment would bestow. But Aparna Nair, a historian of disability at the University of Oklahoma, noted that disability communities have used the term for decades, and there are many other reasons behind brain fog’s dismissal beyond terminology. (A surfeit of syllables didn’t stop fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis from being trivialized.)</p><p>For example, Hellmuth noted that in her field of cognitive neurology, “virtually all the infrastructure and teaching” centers on degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, in which rogue proteins afflict elderly brains. Few researchers know that viruses can cause cognitive disorders in younger people, so few study their effects. “As a result, no one learns about it in medical school,” Hellmuth said. And because “there’s not a lot of humility in medicine, people end up blaming patients instead of looking for answers,” she said.</p><p>People with brain fog also excel at hiding it: None of the long-haulers I’ve interviewed sounded cognitively impaired. But at times when her speech is obviously sluggish, “nobody except my husband and mother see me,” Robertson said. The stigma that long-haulers experience also motivates them to present as normal in social situations or doctor appointments, which compounds the mistaken sense that they’re less impaired than they claim—and can be debilitatingly draining. “They’ll do what is asked of them when you’re testing them, and your results will say they were normal,” David Putrino, who leads a long-COVID rehabilitation clinic at Mount Sinai, told me. “It’s only if you check in on them two days later that you’ll see you’ve wrecked them for a week.”</p><p>“We also don’t have the right tools for measuring brain fog,” Putrino said. Doctors often use the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, which was designed to uncover extreme mental problems in elderly people with dementia, and “isn’t validated for anyone under age 55,” Hellmuth told me. Even a person with severe brain fog can ace it. More sophisticated tests exist, but they still compare people with the population average rather than their previous baseline. “A high-functioning person with a decline in their abilities who falls within the normal range is told they don’t have a problem,” Hellmuth said.</p><p>This pattern exists for many long-COVID symptoms: Doctors order inappropriate or overly simplistic tests, whose negative results are used to discredit patients’ genuine symptoms. It doesn’t help that brain fog (and long COVID more generally) disproportionately affects women, who have a long history of being labeled as emotional or hysterical by the medical establishment. But every patient with brain fog “tells me the exact same story of executive-function symptoms,” Hellmuth said. “If people were making this up, the clinical narrative wouldn’t be the same.”</p><p>Earlier this year, a team of British researchers rendered the invisible nature of brain fog in the stark black-and-white imagery of MRI scans. Gwenaëlle Douaud at the University of Oxford and her colleagues analyzed data from the UK Biobank study, which had regularly scanned the brains of hundreds of volunteers for years prior to the pandemic. When some of those volunteers caught COVID, the team could compare their after scans to the before ones. They found that even mild infections can slightly shrink the brain and reduce the thickness of its neuron-rich gray matter. At their worst, these changes were comparable to a decade of aging. They were especially pronounced in areas such as the parahippocampal gyrus, which is important for encoding and retrieving memories, and the orbitofrontal cortex, which is important for executive function. They were still apparent in people who hadn’t been hospitalized. And they were accompanied by cognitive problems.</p><p>Although SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID, can enter and infect the central nervous system, it doesn’t do so efficiently, persistently, or frequently, Michelle Monje, a neuro-oncologist at Stanford, told me. Instead, she thinks that in most cases the virus harms the brain without directly infecting it. She and her colleagues recently showed that when mice experience mild bouts of COVID, inflammatory chemicals can travel from the lungs to the brain, where they disrupt cells called microglia. Normally, microglia act as groundskeepers, supporting neurons by pruning unnecessary connections and cleaning unwanted debris. When inflamed, their efforts become overenthusiastic and destructive. In their presence, the hippocampus—a region crucial for memory—produces fewer fresh neurons, while many existing neurons lose their insulating coats, so electric signals now course along these cells more slowly. These are the same changes that Monje sees in cancer patients with “chemo fog.” And although she and her team did their COVID experiments in mice, they found high levels of the same inflammatory chemicals in long-haulers with brain fog.</p><p>Monje suspects that neuro-inflammation is “probably the most common way” that COVID results in brain fog, but that there are likely many such routes. COVID could possibly trigger autoimmune problems in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the nervous system, or reactivate dormant viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus, which has been linked to conditions including ME/CFS and multiple sclerosis. By damaging blood vessels and filling them with small clots, COVID also throttles the brain’s blood supply, depriving this most energetically demanding of organs of oxygen and fuel. This oxygen shortfall isn’t stark enough to kill neurons or send people to an ICU, but “the brain isn’t getting what it needs to fire on all cylinders,” Putrino told me. (The severe oxygen deprivation that forces some people with COVID into critical care causes different cognitive problems than what most long-haulers experience.)</p><p>None of these explanations is set in stone, but they can collectively make sense of brain fog’s features. A lack of oxygen would affect sophisticated and energy-dependent cognitive tasks first, which explains why executive function and language “are the first ones to go,” Putrino said. Without insulating coats, neurons work more slowly, which explains why many long-haulers feel that their processing speed is shot: “You’re losing the thing that facilitates fast neural connection between brain regions,” Monje said. These problems can be exacerbated or mitigated by factors such as sleep and rest, which explains why many people with brain fog have good days and bad days. And although other respiratory viruses can wreak inflammatory havoc on the brain, SARS-CoV-2 does so more potently than, say, influenza, which explains both why people such as Robertson developed brain fog long before the current pandemic and why the symptom is especially prominent among COVID long-haulers.</p><p>Perhaps the most important implication of this emerging science is that brain fog is “potentially reversible,” Monje said. If the symptom was the work of a persistent brain infection, or the mass death of neurons following severe oxygen starvation, it would be hard to undo. But neuroinflammation isn’t destiny. Cancer researchers, for example, have developed drugs that can calm berserk microglia in mice and restore their cognitive abilities; some are being tested in early clinical trials. “I’m hopeful that we’ll find the same to be true in COVID,” she said.</p><p>Biomedical advances might take years to arrive, but long-haulers need help with brain fog now. Absent cures, most approaches to treatment are about helping people manage their symptoms. Sounder sleep, healthy eating, and other generic lifestyle changes can make the condition more tolerable. Breathing and relaxation techniques can help people through bad flare-ups; speech therapy can help those with problems finding words. Some over-the-counter medications such as antihistamines can ease inflammatory symptoms, while stimulants can boost lagging concentration.</p><p>“Some people spontaneously recover back to baseline,” Hellmuth told me, “but two and a half years on, a lot of patients I see are no better.” And between these extremes lies perhaps the largest group of long-haulers—those whose brain fog has improved but not vanished, and who can “maintain a relatively normal life, but only after making serious accommodations,” Putrino said. Long recovery periods and a slew of lifehacks make regular living possible, but more slowly and at higher cost.</p><p>Kristen Tjaden can read again, albeit for short bursts followed by long rests, but hasn’t returned to work. Angela Meriquez Vázquez can work but can’t multitask or process meetings in real time. Julia Moore Vogel, who helps lead a large biomedical research program, can muster enough executive function for her job, but “almost everything else in my life I’ve cut out to make room for that,” she told me. “I only leave the house or socialize once a week.” And she rarely talks about these problems openly because “in my field, your brain is your currency,” she said. “I know my value in many people’s eyes will be diminished by knowing that I have these cognitive challenges.”</p><p>Patients struggle to make peace with how much they’ve changed and the stigma associated with it, regardless of where they end up. Their desperation to return to normal can be dangerous, especially when combined with cultural norms around pressing on through challenges and post-exertional malaise—severe crashes in which all symptoms worsen after even minor physical or mental exertion. Many long-haulers try to push themselves back to work and instead “push themselves into a crash,” Robertson told me. When she tried to force her way to normalcy, she became mostly housebound for a year, needing full-time care. Even now, if she tries to concentrate in the middle of a bad day, “I end up with a physical reaction of exhaustion and pain, like I’ve run a marathon,” she said.</p><p>Post-exertional malaise is so common among long-haulers that “exercise as a treatment is inappropriate for people with long COVID,” Putrino said. Even brain-training games—which have questionable value but are often mentioned as potential treatments for brain fog—must be very carefully rationed because mental exertion is physical exertion. People with ME/CFS learned this lesson the hard way, and fought hard to get exercise therapy, once commonly prescribed for the condition, to be removed from official guidance in the U.S. and U.K. They’ve also learned the value of pacing—carefully sensing and managing their energy levels to avoid crashes.</p><p>Vogel does this with a wearable that tracks her heart rate, sleep, activity, and stress as a proxy for her energy levels; if they feel low, she forces herself to rest—cognitively as well as physically. Checking social media or responding to emails do not count. In those moments, “you have to accept that you have this medical crisis and the best thing you can do is literally nothing,” she said. When stuck in a fog, sometimes the only option is to stand still.</p>",

        "description": "<p>I’ve always been interested in tapping into the “crowd” to fund things that need to happen and that our current institutions can’t figure out how to support. Our investment in Kickstarter back in 2009 is an excellent example of that. In the last thirteen years, Kickstarter has helped direct $6.2bn towards creative work that would not have been funded by the legacy institutions that support creative work. That has led to all sorts of interesting projects which are too numerous to mention here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our interest in web3 which started back in 2011 was also grounded in the idea that new forms of funding are necessary to finance innovation and creative work. I am not sure if anyone has tracked how much funding the web3 sector has directed towards new projects over the last decade, but I am certain it is in the tens of billions, if not more. And the vast majority of this funding has come from individuals, not institutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we turn our attention toward climate and the existential threat of a warming planet, these ideas are top of mine for me. And that is why Regenerative Finance (aka ReFI) is so interesting to me. ReFi is an idea, like DeFi, based on a set of web3 technologies and economics, that suggests that efforts to combat climate change can and will be funded by the crowd.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a great example:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Introducing @NewAtlantisDAO—an ocean regeneration project built on an open metagenomics protocol. Serial entrepreneur @G0rd0n_ is looking to scale blue ocean and marine biodiversity markets using #web3 and #DeSci. https://t.co/a2hfeEDNbkA quick thread  1/</p>— ReFi DAO  #GR15 (@ReFiDAOist) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\n\n<p>My friends Gordon and Courtney built the New Atlantis DAO to create open public datasets about the evolving ocean climate and funding mechanisms to support work that moves the data in the right direction. If you click on the tweet I posted above, you can learn more about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that is just one of many different ReFi projects that are being started right now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>USV is invested in the Toucan Protocol which is building the web3 infrastructure to bring carbon offsets on-chain and to allow them to be traded/invested/etc using DeFi protocols. There has been some negative press about Toucan, but that reporting misunderstands what Toucan is doing and why it is so important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is ironic that many in the environmental justice and climate movements are so anti web3. Because web3 presents a set of tools, technologies, and economics that can and is being used to bring badly needed innovation, innovators, and funds to the fight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is my hope that ReFi is the movement that brings all of these folks together and aligns us all to fight the good fight, the necessary fight and that we win this fight.</p>\nUSV TEAM POSTS:<p>Albert Wenger — Sep 6, 2022USV Analyst Program 2022</p>",

        "description": "<p>Joe Mangina:</p>\n\n<p>For a healthy balance between the apophatic and kataphatic we should look to the liturgy. The liturgy is a complex performance, a ritualized midrash on Holy Scripture that alternates between moments of knowing and not-knowing. Think of the Sanctus, where the seraphic hymn of “holy, holy, holy” declares the LORD’s radical otherness even as it announces his presence among us. The readings and their commentary in the sermon would seem to represent a powerfully kataphatic moment, and so they are; we do not proclaim the gospel with our fingers crossed. And yet the public reading of Scripture, a practice especially dear to Anglicans, reminds us that there is always more of Scripture than we can exhaust with our ideas about it. Sadly,  the lectionary regularly edits out some of the weirder stuff in the Bible. We could use more of the weird stuff — more reminders that God is God, and that there is always more of God to know. Yet at the heart of the entire liturgy stands the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus, in whom the invisible God has made himself startlingly well-known to us humans. The passion is a divine mystery that in a certain way excludes us; it is God who is the agent here, not ourselves. And yet the assembly that celebrates it is the body of Christ, the community of those who have been incorporated into Christ’s passion and death, and in him offer their worship to the Father.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Mark Brown/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>It was a mixed bag for G-Rod in his third rehab outing, but he struck out seven. Meanwhile, Bruce Zimmermann had a solid six-inning start for Norfolk.</p> Triple-A: Norfolk Tides 9, Memphis Redbirds (Cardinals) 2\n<p>Memphis actually got on the board first with a third-inning run-scoring double. The Redbirds tried to score two on the play, but Tides outfielder Brett Phillips threw out the second runner at home plate. After that, it was all Tides, who outscored Memphis 9-1. </p>\n<p>Robert Neustrom drove in three runs on a pair of hits. Jordan Westburg went 1-for-4 and drove in a run with a sac fly. Joey Ortiz singled, walked twice and scored two runs. Tyler Nevin went 2-for-4, drove in a run, and walked. Catcher Cody Roberts went 2-for-4, and Cadyn Grenier hit a two-run single. </p>\n<p>Starting pitcher Bruce Zimmermann turned in a tidy appearance, going six innings on 86 pitches (52 of which were strikes). Zimmermann allowed two runs on five hits and whiffed three. After Zimmermann, the bullpen flashed, with Ryan Watson, Nick Vespi, and newcomer Anthony Castro throwing three scoreless. Castro (picked up on Sept. 3 off waivers from Cleveland) somehow managed to walk three hitters in just one inning, but he also whiffed two and kept Memphis off the board.</p>\n<p>Box Score</p>\nDouble-A: Richmond Flying Squirrels (Giants) 9, Bowie Baysox 6\n<p>Grayson Rodriguez started Bowie’s last home game of the season, and it was kind of a mixed bag. Rodriguez threw 56 pitches, just 29 for strikes. He struck out seven in 2.2 innings, but also walked the bases loaded in the third inning, allowed a single, and left the game. </p>\n<p>After that, the Baysox managed to close the lead to 4-3, but then the Flying Squirrels scored five runs in the last two innings off Adam Stauffer and Hector Pérez to put things out of reach.</p>\n<p>Bowie was outhit 13-5 and didn’t get on the board until the seventh inning, although Richmond did them a solid by walking nine hitters. That included a three-peat of free passes for Coby Mayo, two walks for Darell Hernáiz and three for catcher Maverick Handley, who also singled. Good eye, gentlemen! Toby Welk was credited with 3 RBIs on the day, doubling in two and driving in one more with a forceout. Welk was also at the plate when a fourth run scored for Bowie on a balk.</p>\n<p>Box Score</p>\nHigh-A: Jersey Shore BlueClaws (Phillies) 11, Aberdeen IronBirds 3\n<p>Sunday’s contest with Jersey Shore was a clunker, but the IronBirds end the season 78-54, good enough for a trip to the playoffs! Starting pitcher Jake Lyons (22nd round, 2019) threw four nice innings and then hit a wall. He allowed three straight hits in the fifth inning, then got pulled for right-hander Dan Hammer, who let everybody score. Hammer also walked five batters in 1.1 innings, so safe to say it was a very bad Sunday for him. Alex Pham, entering in the sixth inning, allowed a comparatively OK two earned runs, and Dylan Heid threw a scoreless eighth. </p>\n<p>Although the IronBirds scored just three runs, several guys in the lineup had nice days on offense. Pacing the IronBirds was Heston Kjerstad, who went 2-for-3 with a walk, a homer, and drove in two. Here is Kjerstad going deep. Nice to see some power from the left-handed outfielder. Jud Fabian singled and walked. So did Dylan Beavers. So did Trendon Craig. Max Wagner singled and scored a run. Frederick Bencosme doubled. </p>\n<p>Box Score</p>\nLow-A: Delmarva Shorebirds, Down East Wood Ducks (Rangers) – cancelled (rain)\n<p>Delmarva’s very last game of the season got rained out. That’s crummy luck! It was an up-and-down year for the Orioles’ Low-A team, but there were flashes of potential, especially the 2022 crop. </p>\nThere are no scheduled games for Monday. \n<p></p>",

        "description": "Watched The Umbrella Academy by Contributors to Wikimedia projects from Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\nThe Umbrella Academy is an American superhero streaming television series based on the comic book series of the same name written by Gerard Way, illustrated by Gabriel Bá, and published by Dark Horse Comics. Created for Netflix by Steve Blackman and developed by Jeremy Slater, it revolves around a dysfunctional family of adopted sibling superheroes who reunite to solve the mystery of their father's death and the threat of an imminent apocalypse. The series is produced by Borderline Entertainment (season 1–2), Irish Cowboy (season 3), Dark Horse Entertainment, and Universal Content Productions. Netflix gave seasons 1 &amp; 2 a TV-14 rating while season 3 received a TV-MA rating.\r\n\r\nThe cast features Elliot Page, Tom Hopper, David Castañeda, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Robert Sheehan, Aidan Gallagher, Cameron Britton, Mary J. Blige, John Magaro, Adam Godley, Colm Feore, Justin H. Min, Ritu Arya, Yusuf Gatewood, Marin Ireland, Kate Walsh, Genesis Rodriguez, and Britne Oldford. The adaptation began development as a film optioned by Universal Pictures in 2011. It was eventually shelved in favor of a television series in 2015, before being officially greenlit by Netflix in July 2017. The series is filmed in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario.\r\n\r\nThe first season was released on Netflix on February 15, 2019. In April 2019, Netflix reported that 45 million households had watched season one during its first month of release, thus becoming one of the most-streamed series of the year. That same month, following the success of the first season, the series was renewed for a second season, which was released on July 31, 2020.[1][2] In November 2020, the series was renewed for a third season, which was released on June 22, 2022.\n\n<p>I found The Umbrella Academy to be a quirky series that poses far more questions than it answers. I think that is always going to happen when super humans start jumping through time.</p>\n<p>Although I enjoyed the story line, what I liked the most were the characters and their various relationships. In particular, I enjoyed Klaus’ absurdity and Number Five’s old man in a child’s body.</p>The post 📺 The Umbrella Academy first appeared on Read Write Collect.",

        "description": "<p>Two years ago, I was working on my laptop in an airport lounge in Newark, New Jersey, when I glanced up and saw a couple walking with their two boys. The younger boy slowly made his way on crutches, displaying the telltale signs of a hereditary disease called muscular dystrophy. Generally manifesting in childhood, the disease steadily robs those who have it of their ability to walk. Eventually, I knew, the crutches would no longer be enough.</p><p>My heart skipped a beat. Most types of muscular dystrophy originate with genetic mutations that weaken key muscle proteins, and I had just come from a meeting where a cure appeared possible, using CRISPR technology to rewrite the DNA of kids just like him.</p><p>Imagining how the technology I’d helped create could change this boy’s life, I was overwhelmed with emotion. Beyond hope and wonder, I was filled with a sense of fierce urgency to expand CRISPR’s impact to the people around the world who need it most.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Biotechnology as we know it today came of age in the 1970s, when the advent of technologies to copy individual genes and mass-produce the proteins they encode spurred a molecular revolution. Companies such as Genentech leveraged this new knowledge to create novel medicines and to better control diabetes, cancer, and other debilitating conditions. But before my colleagues and I developed the technology for CRISPR genome editing, we weren’t fully aware of just how far the world was from fulfilling biotech’s promise to create a universe of accessible tools for improving human health and our environment.</p><p>In the mid-2000s, I was leading a research lab at UC Berkeley with a project investigating how microbes are able to protect themselves from viral infection. These defenses rely on repeated sequences of DNA, called CRISPR, which are contained in a microbe’s genome and are essentially a genetic record of a viral attack, derived from a snippet of a virus’s own genome. Based on these records, the bacteria use RNA, DNA’s chemical cousin, to provide proteins (called “cas,” for “CRISPR-associated proteins”) with the information needed to find and destroy future invading viruses.</p><p>In a life-changing collaboration with the French scientist Emmanuelle Charpentier, we figured out how the chemistry of this process could be harnessed not to destroy viral DNA, but to cut the genome with unprecedented ease and accuracy in virtually any cell. This niche discovery has spurred an entire biotech revolution of its own. In animal and plant cells, cutting DNA with CRISPR-Cas9 allows us to turn some genes off and to turn others on. A simple CRISPR edit can suppress the genetic defect responsible for sickle-cell disease, providing an apparent cure to this serious blood disorder. CRISPR has also been used to enable T cells to find and destroy cancer cells, and to disrupt production of a disease-causing protein in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, a genetic disease that irreversibly damages the nerves and heart. An FDA-approved edit to cattle genes re-creates a slick coat, occasionally found in nature, that allows cows to tolerate increasing temperatures; using CRISPR to breed a tomato variety, approved for sale in Japan, has enhanced its nutritional qualities. For other crops, CRISPR is being used to increase yield, reduce pesticide and water use, and protect against disease.</p><p>These advances—and more like them to come in preventive medicine, diagnostics, agriculture, biomanufacturing, and synthetic biology—promise to improve the lives of millions of people. They’ve also launched companies and helped existing ones break new ground. This growing CRISPR economy was estimated at $5.2 billion in 2020; venture investors poured more than $1 billion into the growing ecosystem of genome-editing companies in 2021 alone.</p><p>Sometimes, when I think about my part in all this, I am overcome. Few scientists get to experience what I have. And while I’m immeasurably pleased by the progress that’s happened since the publication of our first CRISPR-Cas9 paper a decade ago, I also feel a continual sense of urgency: Are we dreaming big enough? Moving quickly enough? I think back to the advent of the cellphone—another groundbreaking technology in our shared memory. For those of us lucky enough to have experienced it, the untethering of communication from a landline was a seminal moment. But who could have predicted that this once niche and luxury technology would become so ubiquitous as to outnumber the human population, creating new economies and changing the way we live?</p><p>CRISPR may well be on a similar precipice. But for this technology to be widely adopted, it needs a push, just like mobile phones did. Fueling the proliferation of those devices was a host of other technologies and infrastructure systems—voicemail, cell towers, and processing power far exceeding the system that guided the Apollo to the moon. Ensuring that CRISPR reaches its full potential for clinical applications and beyond will require an even higher level of intentional building with diverse and dedicated collaborators. Governments, universities, and investors will need to make significant and sustained investment in cutting-edge science at labs and at biotechnology companies, as well as investments in infrastructure and manufacturing to ensure that this work is scalable. With this kind of concerted and collective effort, the applications and benefits of CRISPR could become as accessible, commonplace, and useful as the phones in our pockets.</p><p></p><p>These ambitious goals must be tempered by the knowledge that the implications of using CRISPR to change the code of life are profound. For the first time, humans have the ability to alter the foundation of who we are as a species and as individuals. This power could wash through our society to even greater human benefit, becoming a standard-of-care treatment in doctors’ offices or a widely adopted technique for producing crops and animals better adapted to our warming world. When facing progress of this magnitude, the first step toward adoption must be societal buy-in. At the core of most fear is misunderstanding and misinformation; few understand this better than scientists. The more we help people understand the science of CRISPR, the more we can open minds to what is possible when we implement it.</p><p>Powerful technology, of course, comes with the potential for misuse, and CRISPR’s powers raise important questions. How do we ensure that genome editing is deployed only when medically necessary? Who determines what medically necessary means? How do we ensure that those in need have access when people or companies with money and power cut in line? The clinical applications I’ve described so far concern individuals, where genome editing affects only the treated patient. But genome editing could also alter germ lines—eggs, sperm, or embryos—to create heritable changes that can be passed to future generations. Some environmental applications of CRISPR, too, can rapidly change the genetics of large populations. These strategies could help fight the spread of invasive species and devastating diseases such as malaria, but without careful assessment and governance, they could also pose a risk to whole ecosystems.</p><p>In 2018, three years after I first called for a voluntary stop to heritable germline editing in humans, twin girls whose genomes had been altered in order to eliminate a gene linked to HIV infection susceptibility were born in China. The “CRISPR babies” debacle demonstrated why scientists must work closely with regulators to ensure the safe and ethical use of such a powerful tool. Without these guardrails, we may not only harm humans and our environment, but also risk societal backlash against the very technologies that could preserve and improve our health and make our planet more livable.</p><p>These days, much of my own energy is focused on making sure that the people and patients who will benefit most have access to the climate strategies and medicines made possible by these early efforts and investments. But realizing CRISPR’s full potential will require many more of us to come together. We will need people to research novel clinical applications, plan environmental initiatives, and enforce safety and efficacy for every tool and therapeutic that comes to market. We will also need continual technical advances, including improved methods for delivering these molecules into cells and ensuring editing precision. Academic scientists, industry researchers, investors, policy makers, and members of the public each have a role to play.</p><p>Knowing that all of this came from humble bacteria only underscores the need for curiosity-driven research that will uncover the next breakthrough. Basic research can continually revolutionize science as we know it, but only if we find ways to keep that research going. If we do, our society will be strongly positioned to generate and harness new discoveries that can improve the human condition.</p><p>After my colleagues and I first realized what we had discovered with CRISPR, we often had late-night phone calls to discuss data and imagine where this research was headed. Right away, we started to think of the many ways that the world could use this genome editing technology. It was quickly quite a long list, but looking back now, we didn’t come close to understanding the countless different directions researchers around the world would take—or the new vision of the world this technology would inspire. Looking to the next decade and beyond, I feel both as optimistic and as impatient as I did in that airport lounge, anticipating the future that I know CRISPR will help us build.</p>",

She went on to be instrumental in documenting the efforts made by women during the second world war, and photographed the atrocities of the Holocaust. This image, taken in Egypt in 1937, is from a time that saw her poised between two stages. Her life in thriving avant-garde Paris was behind her, and before her lay adventures in England, where she took pictures of the war for British Vogue. Her time in Egypt, for Miller, was a one of loneliness, when she found living with an expatriate community stifling. The image therefore could be read as an expression of isolation or yearning to escape.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Dan Brink\n    \n\n  <p>Judge continues to hit, but he isn’t getting them out of the park lately.</p> <p>Welcome back to the Aaron Judge Home Run Record Tracker! We’re taking a daily look at where Aaron Judge’s monster season tracks compared to some of the other historic single-season home run leaders in anticipation of Judge potentially joining their ranks. We’ll be going by Team Game because not every player’s seasons were in sync with the calendar days and everyone didn’t play all of the team’s games, which makes this our universal standard. Now, onto Game 141:</p>\nAaron Judge through Game 141 of 2022: 55 HR\n<p>Team Game 141: 9/11 — 1-for-4, 1 RBI, 1 R, 1 K, sacrifice fly</p>\n<p>Aaron Judge has been on a tear lately, and he continued his hot hitting with another base knock in this game. On top of that, he lifted a sacrifice fly for his league-leading 121st RBI of the season. Other than that though, there isn’t much to report — it’s been a few days since Judge has hit one out now. While that’s concerning for our chase here, it has been nice to see the offense thrive without Judge forcing it into motion singlehandedly.</p>\nRoger Maris through Game 141 of 1961: 55 HR\n<p>Team Game 141: 9/7 — 3-for-3, 1 HR, 3 RBI, 2 R, sacrifice fly</p>\n<p>And just like that, the pace is dead even again. Maris homered in back-to-back games at this point to bring himself up to 55, and his latter bomb came in the form of a solo shot in the third inning to put the Yankees up 3-0. Maris was also responsible for an earlier run on an RBI single and later lifted a sacrifice fly, contributing three runs in a game where the Yankees beat Cleveland by four.</p>\n\nBabe Ruth through Game 141 of 1927: 52 HR\n<p>Team Game 141: 9/14 — 1-for-3, 1 BB, 1 K</p>\n<p>The Babe wasn’t particularly active in this one, finding a single in the first inning and later walking in the seventh. The quiet day ended a streak of four straight games with a home run, a streak that massively improved his chances of reaching 60 before the end of the season. He may not have gotten a hold of one on this day, but he wouldn’t have to wait long for his next shot.</p>\nBarry Bonds through Game 141 of 2001: 60 HR\n<p>Team Game 141: 9/6 — 1-for-4, 1 HR, 1 RBI, 2 R, 1 BB</p>\n<p>In the second inning of this game, Bonds lifted a fly ball to right on a 2-2 offering from Albie Lopez. His solo shot placed him at 60 home runs, the first of anyone on this track that we’ve been following to do so. It’s only natural for the man who would set the single-season record to be the leader at this point, but the sheer lead that Bonds had on some of his contemporaries at this point is something to marvel at.</p>\n\nMark McGwire through Game 141 of 1998: 59 HR\n<p>Team Game 141: 9/4 — 0-for-3, 1 BB, 2 K</p>\n<p>All of that being said, McGwire had a chance to set the pace himself here after his torrid couple of days previously. Unfortunately for him, he wasn’t able to get his fifth homer in three games to join Bonds at this breaking point, though by virtue of time he was the one setting the pace originally.</p>\nSammy Sosa through Game 141 of 1998: 57 HR\n<p>Team Game 141: 9/4 — 2-for-5, 1 HR, 2 RBI, 2 R, 1 K</p>\n<p>Sosa had watched as his tie with McGwire vanished in the blink of an eye, and set out to catch up again as quickly as he could. He opened this game against the Pirates with a solo shot in the first inning, earning his second homer in as many days to bring him within two of Big Mac. Sosa singled in his next at-bat, but wouldn’t get on base for the remainder of the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of things happened. Here are some of the things. This is TPM’s Morning Memo.</p>\n\n\n\nThere It Is\n\n\n\n<p>Trump, fully dug into his fake narrative about winning the 2020 election, told aides repeatedly in the days after the election that he was planting himself at the White House and absolutely wouldn’t surrender, according to CNN’s excerpt of an upcoming book by New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman.</p>\n\n\n\n“We’re never leaving,” he reportedly told an aide in one instance. “How can you leave when you won an election?” (he didn’t win the election).But surprisingly enough, Trump apparently didn’t jump into his delusion about his defeat at first: The then-president had reportedly seemed to accept his loss in “the immediate aftermath” (in Haberman’s words) of the election, telling one adviser that “[w]e did our best.”Trump was reportedly so desperate for a solution after the election that he even asked the guy who brought him his Diet Cokes what to do, according to Haberman’s book.\n\n\n\nStephen Miller Subpoenaed By DOJ\n\n\n\n<p>The Justice Department subpoenaed ex-White House senior adviser Stephen Miller last week in its investigation into Trump’s fake elector scheme and his Save America PAC, the New York Times and CNN report.</p>\n\n\n\nThere haven’t been any indications so far that Miller played an active role in the elector plot. He did straight-up tell Fox in December 2020 that “an alternate slate of electors” in what he called “the contested states” was in the process of voting.The DOJ also subpoenaed Brian Jack, Trump’s ex-White House political director and current adviser to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), last week, according to the Times. He’s still working as one of Trump’s advisers.More than a dozen people who worked for the Trump White House or the Trump campaign were subpoenaed by the DOJ last week, per the Times. Those people reportedly included the Trump campaign’s chief financial officer and Ivanka Trump’s ex-chief of staff.\n\n\n\nRussian Media Flails In Face Of Ukraine Invasion Fails\n\n\n\n<p>Julia Davis, a Russian media analyst at the Daily Beast, flagged this remarkable moment during a Russian state TV program in response to Ukraine’s new jaw-dropping offensive against Russian forces in the country’s northeastern region:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Life comes at you fast: pundits on Russian TV realize that their military is failing and their country is in trouble. They are starting to play the blame game.

Romney (who would later vote to convict Trump in both impeachment trials) reportedly implored Biden to launch a presidential bid against Trump during that conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the 2020 election, Romney publicly said he didn’t vote for Trump but kept mum about who he did vote for.</p>\n\n\n\nBidens To Attend Queen Elizabeth’s Funeral\n\n\n\n<p>The White House announced on Sunday that the President and First Lady Jill Biden will travel to the U.K. on Saturday for Queen Elizabeth II’s Sept. 19 state funeral at Westminster Abbey. Buckingham Palace specifically invited the Bidens only, so the President won’t be going with a delegation, per CNN.</p>\n\n\n\nUK’s Period Of Mourning Sure Is Something\n\n\n\n<p>The U.K. is in the middle of its mourning period for Queen Elizabeth II, and I’m not here to tell anyone how pay their respects to a deceased monarch, but…</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the royal period of mourning, you can’t lock your bike to a cycle rack in Norwich. pic.twitter.com/QuFYmUizLj</p>— Jeremy Hutchinson (@Themightyhutch) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\n<p>Do you like Morning Memo? Let us know!</p>",

        "description": "<p>Colorado Rockies news and links for Monday, September 12, 2022</p> <p>There are still more than three weeks left in the Rockies season, and while the team hasn’t yet been eliminated from Wild Card contention, it’s a foregone conclusion that there won’t be any postseason baseball at 20th and Blake this year. Fortunately for Rockies fans, the minor league affiliates will offer playoff baseball this year, and hopefully a glimpse at the future in Rockies purple.</p>\n<p>If you are grasping to remember playoff qualifying procedures in the minors these days and coming up blank, you can be forgiven. The 2020 season as a whole was canceled, and the 2021 season was abbreviated as the start was pushed back in the minors. But 2022 has been a return to somewhat normalcy, and with that, a return to postseason baseball for team’s prospects.</p>\nTriple-A\n<p>First, a primer on the minor league’s playoff qualifying procedures. Triple-A is the most straightforward - the top team in each division by regular season winning percentage in the Pacific Coast League qualify for a one game playoff. The winner will advance to one game, winner-take-all championship against the corresponding champion from the International League. The Isotopes are not in a position to qualify for these playoffs, currently 17 games back of the division leader with just 15 games left to play. The El Paso Chihuahuas (SDP) lead the PCL’s East Division, with the Oklahoma City Dodgers (LAD) and Round Rock Express (TEX) both within two games. Whichever of those teams comes out on top will take on the Reno Aces (ARI) to represent the PCL at the Triple-A National Baseball Championship game.</p>\nDouble-A\n<p>The qualifying procedure for Double-A affiliates is less traditional, but the same as both Single-A levels (well, mostly..). Each division will send two teams to a best-of-three playoff series. The teams are the winner of the second half and the winner of the first half, both by winning percentage. The winner of that best-of-three series will take on the other division champ for the league championship in a best-of-five tilt. In the Eastern League, the Hartford Yard Goats are not benefit by this format. They finished second in the first half of the year, just one game back of the Somerset Patriots (NYY) but got nothing for it other than a clean slate to start the second half. They’ll finish the second half of the season in third behind Portland (BOS) and Somerset, and it will be those two teams that will advance to the playoffs - despite Hartford having the second best overall record.</p>\nHigh-A\n<p>For the Midwest and South Atlantic leagues, the playoff procedure is the same as Double-A and Low-A, as described above. However, that’s not the case for the Spokane Indians and the Northwest League. Since there are only six teams total and no divisions, the first and second half champs will immediately advance and play a best-of-five series to determine the NWL champion. Not that this matters for the Indians - they finished third overall in the yearly standings (second in the first half, third in the second half), so their season ended yesterday. Eugene (SFG) took both halves titles, so the second spot goes to the team with the second best overall winning percentage - in this case, the Vancouver Canadians (TOR). The Indians finished 3.5 games behind them.</p>\nLow-A\n<p>Fresno, fortunately, has already punched their ticket to represent the organization in the next round of games. They won the first half of the California League North by just a game over San Jose (SFG), and for good measure they ran it back in the second half - defeating the Giants and the Modesto Nuts (SEA) to take another crown. As the team with the second-best overall season record, the Giants will face them in the final. Game 1 kicks off Tuesday at San Jose, then games 2 and 3 should be back in Fresno. The Championship series is scheduled to start a week from yesterday, on September 18th. </p>\n<p>★ ★ ★</p>\nColorado’s C.J Cron crushes 504-foot home run vs. Diamondbacks, 2nd-longest in Statcast era | ESPN\n<p>In case you missed it, C.J. Cron is still doing C.J. Cron things. The 2022 All-Star is on pace to set career highs in RBIs and home runs, and although each one counts the same, this one is extra special. Cron took the first pitch he saw from Keynan Middleton and took it deep. Like into the Denver night deep. Like out of the stadium deep. Watch it again for yourself.</p>\n\n\n<p>C.J. Cron's     ft HR-was the longest HR by a Rockie in the StatCast era-tied the longest HR by any player in Coors Field history -tied the second-longest HR measured in StatCast historyOh yeah, and it was an absolute           @FTX_Official x Rockies pic.twitter.com/wgtTPcLZKt</p>— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>This is now the longest home run by a Rockie in the Statcast era, and ties the mammoth shot that Giancarlo Stanton hit at Coors in 2016.</p>\n<p>★ ★ ★</p>\nOn the Farm\nTriple-A: Albuquerque Isotopes 7, El Paso Chihuahuas 6 (10)\n<p>Back from his first big league call up, Wynton Bernard is continuing to show that he belongs higher than AAA. He had two doubles, a home run, and two singles - one being the walk-off winner - to lead the Isotopes over El Paso (SDP).</p>\n\n\n<p>.@SaintBerny36 SMACKS WALK-OFF RBI SINGLE!!!! The best athlete of all-time collects five hits and three RBI!F (10): Isotopes 7, Chihuahuas 6 pic.twitter.com/6fkmN4tttQ</p>— Albuquerque Isotopes (@ABQTopes) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan Vilade added three hits and an RBI of his own to help out Bernard and pace the offense. Next, the Isotopes will play host to the Oklahoma City Dodgers (LAD) and try to play spoiler for their playoff hopes.</p>\nDouble-A: Hartford Yard Goats 8, Somerset Patriots 7\n<p>Hartford sent the home crowd home happy one last time in 2022 Sunday night, getting out hot and scoring eight runs in the first three innings then holding on to preserve the lead. Isaac Collins had four hits, three runs, and two RBIs. Willie Stovall, Grant Lavigne, and Aaron Schunk each had two hits themselves and had three RBIs and two runs scored between them. The bullpen combo of Dugan Darnell, Blair Calvo, and Stephen Jones provided four innings of scoreless relief to secure the win. Hartford will head out on the road for their final series of the year, visiting the Binghamton Rumble Ponies (NYM).</p>\nHigh-A: Tri-City Dust Devils 4, Spokane Indians 3\n<p>Spokane’s season ended up on the road Sunday with a loss to Tri-City (LAA). Bladimir Restituyo accounted for all of the Indian’s scoring offense, touching the plate three times to score all of Spokane’s runs, but his effort was not enough to take down the Dust Devils. Spokane ends the season two games under .500.</p>\nLow-A: Fresno Grizzlies 12, San Jose Giants 10\n<p>In a preview of the California League Championship series starting tomorrow, Fresno and San Jose (SFG) had a good old fashioned slugfest to wrap up the Low-A regular season. Adael Amador, Benny Montgomery, and Sterlin Thompson - the one, two, three batters in Fresno’s order - each had three hits and knocked in four runs and scored six between them. Game 1 of the League Championship series will be Tuesday at San Jose, followed by Games 2 and 3 (if necessary) back in Fresno.</p>\n<p>★ ★ ★</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind our Purple Row Community Guidelines when you’re commenting.

        "description": "<p>Spanish developer Elwin Gorman’s upcoming video game Naiad brings us all the serenity and joy of wild swimming without a Dryrobe in sight</p><p>As a child, Elwin Gorman would go on long, winding river walks in the picturesque region of Murcia in southern Spain. Gorman senior, an agent for the Spanish environmental ministry, was attuned to the wellbeing of the watery ecosystem, and keen to teach his son how to love the natural world. Naiad, a video game where florid new age aesthetics meet wild swimming, is the product of that love. It feels designed to soothe and restore us in these horribly choppy times.</p><p>Gorman’s fondness for nature is visible from the very first frame of the game, whose name refers to the water nymphs of Greek mythology. Across a three-hour journey, you navigate the gentle currents of a single river, solving environmental puzzles, meeting a cast of human and non-human characters, even singing to regenerate ailing flora. The water shimmers evocatively, drawing the eye just as it would in real life, and the colours have a gorgeous cartoonish pop. The visual style recalls Studio Ghibli’s most naturalistic animated films, particularly its 2008 oceanic classic, Ponyo.</p><p>Naiad is out 13 October, on PC and consoles. A demo is available on Steam.</p> Continue reading...",

Chinese President Xi Jinping has been cast as a dictator bent on ensuring China replaces the U.S. as the strongest and most influential global power. And after the ill-timed visit to Taiwan by congressional delegations, China has stopped all military-to-military talks with the U.S. — a very worrisome step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia has invaded Ukraine without cause. Russian President Vladimir Putin has been labelled a “war criminal” by President Biden — hardly the best basis for communicating. Russia has intimated that under certain circumstances it could resort to using nuclear weapons in self-defense.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia is using energy to blackmail Europe to end sanctions and cease and desist from supporting Ukraine. The possibility of the war spreading beyond Ukraine cannot be dismissed. And with the onset of winter and presumably bad weather limiting military operations, new uncertainties and dangers will arise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At home, the Constitution is under attack. The FBI’s search of former President Trump’s Florida home was not only unprecedented. It could lead to a national crisis unlike any the nation has ever endured. Suppose it was beyond any reasonable doubt that the former president broke laws that would put ordinary U.S. citizens behind bars for a considerable period. Would he be indicted, tried or convicted? That question could well determine the future of the U.S. legal and political systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the economic outlook for most Americans is bleak. Inflation is approaching double digits. Gasoline prices, while slowly coming down, are still very high. The New York Times reports that, “Nearly two-thirds of Americans are now living paycheck to paycheck. An estimated 41 percent — 135 million people — are considered either poor or low-income. Eighteen percent of households earn less than $25,000 a year. Even before the pandemic hit, one in four Black families had a net worth of zero.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>America has always faced crises. The significant and defining difference is that never in the nation’s history has the U.S. confronted, simultaneously, such massive threats at home and abroad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Americans intuitively understand where the country seems to be headed. By some polls, nearly 90 percent disagree with that direction. As a result, a large majority of Americans do not see a better future ahead. And virtually all institutions, especially those of the federal government, are either distrusted or thought to be incapable of providing competent governance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elections seem to make matters worse. Small, powerful extremes dominate both parties. The party of Lincoln, Eisenhower and Reagan is now the party, or more precisely the cult, of Trump. Progressivism has run amuck in distorting the old Democratic Party of Roosevelt, Kennedy and Johnson. And third parties do not work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are my descriptions of current conditions exaggerated? Or are conditions as grim or even worse than described? After all, muddling through has often worked — but it may not this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all my columns less this one, I have proposed recommendations to correct or fix the identified problems or impasses. Unfortunately, this time I can only return to Ben Franklin, who wisely observed, “You have a republic as long, as you can keep it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harlan Ullman is senior adviser at the Atlantic Council and the prime author of “shock and awe.” His latest  book is “The Fifth Horseman and the New MAD: How Massive Attacks of Disruption Became the Looming Existential Danger to a Divided Nation and the World at Large.” Follow him on Twitter @harlankullman.</p>",

        "description": "<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of things happened. Here are some of the things. This is TPM’s Morning Memo.</p>\n\n\n\nThere It Is\n\n\n\n<p>Trump, fully dug into his fake narrative about winning the 2020 election, told aides repeatedly in the days after the election that he was planting himself at the White House and absolutely wouldn’t surrender, according to CNN’s excerpt of an upcoming book by New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman.</p>\n\n\n\n“We’re never leaving,” he reportedly told an aide in one instance. “How can you leave when you won an election?” (he didn’t win the election).But surprisingly enough, Trump apparently didn’t jump into his delusion about his defeat at first: The then-president had reportedly seemed to accept his loss in “the immediate aftermath” (in Haberman’s words) of the election, telling one adviser that “[w]e did our best.”Trump was reportedly so desperate for a solution after the election that he even asked the guy who brought him his Diet Cokes what to do, according to Haberman’s book.\n\n\n\nStephen Miller Subpoenaed By DOJ\n\n\n\n<p>The Justice Department subpoenaed ex-White House senior adviser Stephen Miller last week in its investigation into Trump’s fake elector scheme and his Save America PAC, the New York Times and CNN report.</p>\n\n\n\nThere haven’t been any indications so far that Miller played an active role in the elector plot. He did straight-up tell Fox in December 2020 that “an alternate slate of electors” in what he called “the contested states” was in the process of voting.The DOJ also subpoenaed Brian Jack, Trump’s ex-White House political director and current adviser to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), last week, according to the Times. He’s still working as one of Trump’s advisers.More than a dozen people who worked for the Trump White House or the Trump campaign were subpoenaed by the DOJ last week, per the Times. Those people reportedly included the Trump campaign’s chief financial officer and Ivanka Trump’s ex-chief of staff.\n\n\n\nRussian Media Flails In Face Of Ukraine Invasion Fails\n\n\n\n<p>Julia Davis, a Russian media analyst at the Daily Beast, flagged this remarkable moment during a Russian state TV program in response to Ukraine’s new jaw-dropping offensive against Russian forces in the country’s northeastern region:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Life comes at you fast: pundits on Russian TV realize that their military is failing and their country is in trouble. They are starting to play the blame game.

Romney (who would later vote to convict Trump in both impeachment trials) reportedly implored Biden to launch a presidential bid against Trump during that conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the 2020 election, Romney publicly said he didn’t vote for Trump but kept mum about who he did vote for.</p>\n\n\n\nBidens To Attend Queen Elizabeth’s Funeral\n\n\n\n<p>The White House announced on Sunday that the President and First Lady Jill Biden will travel to the U.K. on Saturday for Queen Elizabeth II’s Sept. 19 state funeral at Westminster Abbey.

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/giants-wilmer-flores-agree-to-two-year-extension.html",
        "description": "<p>The Giants are keeping around one of their impending free agents, announcing agreement with infielder Wilmer Flores on a multi-year deal. The contract reportedly pays Flores $6.5MM in each of the next two seasons and contains a player/club option for 2025. That season, Flores will first have to decide on a $3.5MM player option; if he declines, the team can keep him in the fold by triggering an $8.5MM club option. Between his salaries over the next two seasons and the value of the player option, Flores is technically guaranteed $16.5MM over three years.</p>\n<p>Flores, 31, played six seasons with the Mets and one with the Diamondbacks to begin his career. Prior to the 2020 season, he signed with the Giants on a two-year deal with a $6.25MM guarantee. That came in the form of a $3MM salary in 2020 and 2021, with a $250K buyout $3.5MM club option for 2022.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although he’s never been an All-Star, Flores has been steadily above-average at the plate for years and that’s been true of his time in San Fran as well. In 2020, he hit 12 home runs in the shortened season and produced a batting line of .268/.315/.515. That production was 19% above league average, as evidenced by his 119 wRC+. He followed that up with 18 homers in 2021 and a line of .262/.335/.447, 112 wRC+. The Giants made the easy call of exercising their option for 2022 and were rewarded with another solid Flores season. He’s added another 18 homers already this year, with an overall slash line of .235/.319/.414, wRC+ of 107. This is the seventh consecutive season in which Flores has registered a wRC+ between 102 and 119. Instead of returning to the open market, he will stick in San Francisco for another couple seasons.</p>\n<p>He has produced that consistently solid work at the plate while also giving the Giants defensive versatility, something they clearly value highly in players. In all three of his seasons with the Giants, he has bounced between first base, second base and third base as needed. That’s been especially important for a club that features some older or injury-prone regulars like Evan Longoria, Brandon Belt and Tommy La Stella. Going forward, La Stella has one more year on his contract but he hasn’t played much defense this year, taking the field for just 66 innings so far. It’s also possible Longoria and Belt won’t be around next year. Belt is heading to free agency after this year and faces an uncertain road ahead, having just undergone surgery on his oft-injured knee. Longoria could be retained for next year via a $13MM club option with a $5MM buyout, though he told Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle that he has at least given some thought to retirement.</p>\n<p>Given the uncertainty surrounding those infielders, it makes sense to lock up a reliable and versatile contributor like Flores. He can now be penciled into an infield mix that includes La Stella, rookie David Villar, Thairo Estrada, Brandon Crawford, J.D. Davis, with LaMonte Wade Jr. perhaps playing some first base or returning to strictly outfield work. Crawford and La Stella are both slated to become free agents after 2023, which will further thin out this group for the second year of Flores’ deal.</p>\n<p>The Giants ran an Opening Day payroll of $155MM here in 2022, according to Cot’s Contracts. Flores’ deal pushes the team’s 2023 payroll commitments to around $95MM, in the estimation of Jason Martinez of Roster Resource. That doesn’t include arbitration raises for players like Mike Yastrzemski or Logan Webb, but it does include Carlos Rodón’s $22.5MM. As long as Rodón finishes the season healthy, he will exercise the opt out on his deal and return to free agency in search of a larger payday.</p>\n<p>It’s been a disappointing season for the Giants, as they followed up their 107-win campaign in 2021 with a 67-73 record so far in 2022. It figures to be a very interesting offseason, as the club will head into the winter with many holes that need to be filled but lots of payroll space available for addressing them. Anthony DeSclafani is the only player under contract for 2024 and the slate is completely clean beyond that, giving the Giants the ability to make a sizable commitment, or commitments, before Spring Training. But for now, they’ve retained one of their most stable and dependable guys to bolster their infield mix, giving them one less thing to worry about over the winter.</p>\n<p>Joel Sherman of the New York Post first reported the Giants and Flores were in agreement on a two-year deal with an option for 2025. Daniel Álvarez-Montes of ElExtrabase was first to report the matching $6.5MM salaries over the next two seasons.</p>\n<p>Image courtesy of USA Today Sports.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Two years ago, I was working on my laptop in an airport lounge in Newark, New Jersey, when I glanced up and saw a couple walking with their two boys. The younger boy slowly made his way on crutches, displaying the telltale signs of a hereditary disease called muscular dystrophy. Generally manifesting in childhood, the disease steadily robs those who have it of their ability to walk. Eventually, I knew, the crutches would no longer be enough.</p><p>My heart skipped a beat. Most types of muscular dystrophy originate with genetic mutations that weaken key muscle proteins, and I had just come from a meeting where a cure appeared possible, using CRISPR technology to rewrite the DNA of kids just like him.</p><p>Imagining how the technology I’d helped create could change this boy’s life, I was overwhelmed with emotion. Beyond hope and wonder, I was filled with a sense of fierce urgency to expand CRISPR’s impact to the people around the world who need it most.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Biotechnology as we know it today came of age in the 1970s, when the advent of technologies to copy individual genes and mass-produce the proteins they encode spurred a molecular revolution. Companies such as Genentech leveraged this new knowledge to create novel medicines and to better control diabetes, cancer, and other debilitating conditions. But before my colleagues and I developed the technology for CRISPR genome editing, we weren’t fully aware of just how far the world was from fulfilling biotech’s promise to create a universe of accessible tools for improving human health and our environment.</p><p>In the mid-2000s, I was leading a research lab at UC Berkeley with a project investigating how microbes are able to protect themselves from viral infection. These defenses rely on repeated sequences of DNA, called CRISPR, which are contained in a microbe’s genome and are essentially a genetic record of a viral attack, derived from a snippet of a virus’s own genome. Based on these records, the bacteria use RNA, DNA’s chemical cousin, to provide proteins (called “cas,” for “CRISPR-associated proteins”) with the information needed to find and destroy future invading viruses.</p><p>In a life-changing collaboration with the French scientist Emmanuelle Charpentier, we figured out how the chemistry of this process could be harnessed not to destroy viral DNA, but to cut the genome with unprecedented ease and accuracy in virtually any cell. This niche discovery has spurred an entire biotech revolution of its own. In animal and plant cells, cutting DNA with CRISPR-Cas9 allows us to turn some genes off and to turn others on. A simple CRISPR edit can suppress the genetic defect responsible for sickle-cell disease, providing an apparent cure to this serious blood disorder. CRISPR has also been used to enable T cells to find and destroy cancer cells, and to disrupt production of a disease-causing protein in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, a genetic disease that irreversibly damages the nerves and heart. An FDA-approved edit to cattle genes re-creates a slick coat, occasionally found in nature, that allows cows to tolerate increasing temperatures; using CRISPR to breed a tomato variety, approved for sale in Japan, has enhanced its nutritional qualities. For other crops, CRISPR is being used to increase yield, reduce pesticide and water use, and protect against disease.</p><p>These advances—and more like them to come in preventive medicine, diagnostics, agriculture, biomanufacturing, and synthetic biology—promise to improve the lives of millions of people. They’ve also launched companies and helped existing ones break new ground. This growing CRISPR economy was estimated at $5.2 billion in 2020; venture investors poured more than $1 billion into the growing ecosystem of genome-editing companies in 2021 alone.</p><p>Sometimes, when I think about my part in all this, I am overcome. Few scientists get to experience what I have. And while I’m immeasurably pleased by the progress that’s happened since the publication of our first CRISPR-Cas9 paper a decade ago, I also feel a continual sense of urgency: Are we dreaming big enough? Moving quickly enough? I think back to the advent of the cellphone—another groundbreaking technology in our shared memory. For those of us lucky enough to have experienced it, the untethering of communication from a landline was a seminal moment. But who could have predicted that this once niche and luxury technology would become so ubiquitous as to outnumber the human population, creating new economies and changing the way we live?</p><p>CRISPR may well be on a similar precipice. But for this technology to be widely adopted, it needs a push, just like mobile phones did. Fueling the proliferation of those devices was a host of other technologies and infrastructure systems—voicemail, cell towers, and processing power far exceeding the system that guided the Apollo to the moon. Ensuring that CRISPR reaches its full potential for clinical applications and beyond will require an even higher level of intentional building with diverse and dedicated collaborators. Governments, universities, and investors will need to make significant and sustained investment in cutting-edge science at labs and at biotechnology companies, as well as investments in infrastructure and manufacturing to ensure that this work is scalable. With this kind of concerted and collective effort, the applications and benefits of CRISPR could become as accessible, commonplace, and useful as the phones in our pockets.</p><p></p><p>These ambitious goals must be tempered by the knowledge that the implications of using CRISPR to change the code of life are profound. For the first time, humans have the ability to alter the foundation of who we are as a species and as individuals. This power could wash through our society to even greater human benefit, becoming a standard-of-care treatment in doctors’ offices or a widely adopted technique for producing crops and animals better adapted to our warming world. When facing progress of this magnitude, the first step toward adoption must be societal buy-in. At the core of most fear is misunderstanding and misinformation; few understand this better than scientists. The more we help people understand the science of CRISPR, the more we can open minds to what is possible when we implement it.</p><p>Powerful technology, of course, comes with the potential for misuse, and CRISPR’s powers raise important questions. How do we ensure that genome editing is deployed only when medically necessary? Who determines what medically necessary means? How do we ensure that those in need have access when people or companies with money and power cut in line? The clinical applications I’ve described so far concern individuals, where genome editing affects only the treated patient. But genome editing could also alter germ lines—eggs, sperm, or embryos—to create heritable changes that can be passed to future generations. Some environmental applications of CRISPR, too, can rapidly change the genetics of large populations. These strategies could help fight the spread of invasive species and devastating diseases such as malaria, but without careful assessment and governance, they could also pose a risk to whole ecosystems.</p><p>In 2018, three years after I first called for a voluntary stop to heritable germline editing in humans, twin girls whose genomes had been altered in order to eliminate a gene linked to HIV infection susceptibility were born in China. The “CRISPR babies” debacle demonstrated why scientists must work closely with regulators to ensure the safe and ethical use of such a powerful tool. Without these guardrails, we may not only harm humans and our environment, but also risk societal backlash against the very technologies that could preserve and improve our health and make our planet more livable.</p><p>These days, much of my own energy is focused on making sure that the people and patients who will benefit most have access to the climate strategies and medicines made possible by these early efforts and investments. But realizing CRISPR’s full potential will require many more of us to come together. We will need people to research novel clinical applications, plan environmental initiatives, and enforce safety and efficacy for every tool and therapeutic that comes to market. We will also need continual technical advances, including improved methods for delivering these molecules into cells and ensuring editing precision. Academic scientists, industry researchers, investors, policy makers, and members of the public each have a role to play.</p><p>Knowing that all of this came from humble bacteria only underscores the need for curiosity-driven research that will uncover the next breakthrough. Basic research can continually revolutionize science as we know it, but only if we find ways to keep that research going. If we do, our society will be strongly positioned to generate and harness new discoveries that can improve the human condition.</p><p>After my colleagues and I first realized what we had discovered with CRISPR, we often had late-night phone calls to discuss data and imagine where this research was headed. Right away, we started to think of the many ways that the world could use this genome editing technology. It was quickly quite a long list, but looking back now, we didn’t come close to understanding the countless different directions researchers around the world would take—or the new vision of the world this technology would inspire. Looking to the next decade and beyond, I feel both as optimistic and as impatient as I did in that airport lounge, anticipating the future that I know CRISPR will help us build.</p>",

It’s almost like he wills it to happen. The ‘I’ve got to be good today. This team needs me.’ That’s what the good ones do. Whether they have their good stuff or not. “You take that mentality and you mix it with good stuff for highly talented people, you’re going to see special things happen. Today was a special outing for Brady.”</p>\n\n<p>Brady saw what he had to do as a stopper.</p>\n<p>“I try to keep my mentality the same all the time, but with the two losses before, the mentality was a little bit better today,” Singer said. “Going out there, trying to get deep in the game and going right at them. They’ve had two good offensive days, so to go out there and do that was big.”</p>\n<p>Jonathan Heasley struggled under wet conditions on Saturday.</p>\n\n<p>“It was honestly just pretty frustrating, unfortunate,” Heasley said of the conditions. “I don’t want to make excuses. At the end of the day, I’m out there and you’ve got to compete and get your job done. And I was unable to do that today. </p>\n<p>“At the beginning, I felt alright. Felt like I was just warming up, settling in and the rain starts coming down. Then, I just honestly had a really hard time with the grip. That was the biggest thing. So I was just trying to throw strikes at that point.” </p>\n<p>Heasley admitted he threw primarily his fastball and changeup because he felt like he had the best grip on both of those pitches.</p>\n\n<p>Matheny comments on the new rule changes coming in 2023, including a ban on defensive shifts.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never liked the shift. Never,” Matheny said. “There are some left-handers in the league that just became more valuable.” </p>\n<p>Kevin O’Brien at Royals Reporter looks at the Royals’ growth this year.</p>\n<p>Jordan Foote at Inside the Royals highlights Nick Loftin’s hot finish.</p>\n<p>Jared Perkins at Royals Farm Report profiles prospect Carter Jensen.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers become the first team this year to clinch a playoff spot.</p>\n<p>Albert Pujols passes Alex Rodriguez on the all-time home runs list with #697.</p>\n<p>Former coach Buck O’Neil is inducted into the Cubs Hall of Fame along with outfielder José Cardenal and broadcaster Pat Hughes.</p>\n<p>Dave Stewart has his number retired by the Oakland Athletics.</p>\n<p>Former Cubs outfielder Kosuke Fukudome announces he will retire from the Japanese NPB at age 45.</p>\n<p>Right-hander Edwin Jackson announces his retirement after 14 seasons.</p>\n<p>Why have the Giants gone from 107 wins to a below .500 record?</p>\n<p>Former MLB pitcher-turned-cop Anthony Varvaro is killed in a crash on his way to a 9/11 memorial.</p>\n<p>Billionaire businessman Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong is mulling making a bid on the Angels.</p>\n<p>How Guardians pitching coach Carl Willis has mastered the art of the mound visit.</p>\n<p>The Sun Belt Conference looks like one of the best conferences in college football.</p>\n<p>Kickers had a rough first week in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Scientists are trying to learn more about how whale brains work.</p>\n<p>How will King Charles III rule?</p>\n<p>The 200 greatest hip-hop albums of all time.</p>\n<p>Your song of the day is The Notorious B.I.G. with Hypnotize.</p>",

Right-hander tossed six no-hit innings with nine strikeouts in his last start.</p>— Jason Mackey (@JMackeyPG) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The 23-year-old pitcher has had an excellent season, to say the least, both with Double-A Altoona and Indianapolis. In 23 starts for the Curve, that spanned just over 114 innings, Ortiz posted a 5-9 record with a 4.64 ERA but struck out 126 hitters compared to 34 walks.</p>\n<p>The brunt of Ortiz’s success came in August with Altoona as he allowed just nine earned runs over 28 innings pitched. In three of those appearances, he went six or more innings. But let’s not forget that he tossed not one, but two immaculate innings over the course of the season.</p>\n\n\n<p>Luis Ortiz is Immaculate! He strikes out the side on nine pitches in the second inning for the Curve and now has five through two frames! pic.twitter.com/W5pxuHRrEE</p>— Altoona Curve (@AltoonaCurve) July 15, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>All of his work even earned him the No. 30 spot in the organization’s Top 30 prospects, according to MLB Pipeline.</p>\n<p>Looking to capitalize on his success, the Pirates promoted Ortiz to Indianapolis at the beginning of September and, since then, he’s exceeded expectations.</p>\n<p>After a shaky debut on September 2, which saw Ortiz give up four earned runs in four innings, he picked things back up in his next outing on the ninth, which saw him hold opposing hitters hitless through six.</p>\n\n\n<p>Luis Ortiz was dealing. pic.twitter.com/FmriZkeAWT</p>— Young Bucs (@YoungBucsPIT) September 9, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>This is probably a “Contreras Treatment” scenario, where he’ll come up, toss a few innings, and get sent right back down, which is fine considering his quick rise to fame over the course of the season.</p>\n<p>Maybe, and hopefully, this also spells the end of the Bryse Wilson or Tyler Beede experiment.</p>",

And what exactly is a folk song?</p><p>When Steve Roud was young, he began collecting records. Hardly unusual for a child of the 1950s – but this boy from south London was different. Not content with just listening to LPs, Roud began indexing them – his own and ones he found mentioned in newspapers and magazines. He used old shoe boxes as a primitive filing system and wrote the titles on 5x3 inch record cards that his mum bought him once a week. He soon realised his hobby was turning into something more. “Without knowing it,” he says, “I was becoming a librarian.”</p><p>Soon enough, Roud would become one for real, working much of his career for the London borough of Croydon. His infatuation with indexing would persist too, those shoe boxes finally swelling into something remarkable. Even as a teenager, Roud had been fascinated by folk music – how across the centuries, dozens of voices could send songs shooting countless different ways, their titles and lyrics shifting even as their cores remained the same. As he grew up, armed with proper training and new technology, Roud took to collating this bounty in earnest, hunting down leads and developing an elegant method to trace a song’s heritage.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Lindsey Wasson-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>This is certainly a fun Seattle team, but are they destined for October?</p> <p>Happy Monday, one and all. Today we’ve got a little bit of everything for you today, from the passing of a former MLB pitcher to what the future holds for Terry Francona. There’s more discussion about the new rule changes, and of course Albert Pujols’s historic run to 700 home runs.</p>\n<p>But before we get into all that, here’s this incredible moment from Sunday’s Mariners game.</p>\n\n\n<p>“Absolutely incredible finish in front of a sold-out crowd!” pic.twitter.com/H7rTJorHyy</p>— Seattle Mariners (@Mariners) September 12, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>It might just be the end to one game, but Mariners fans and other observers are starting to think this team, loaded with young talent, might actually have what it takes to head to the postseason. As of right now they have a wild card spot, though nothing is guaranteed. Houston seems unbeatable in the West in terms of the division title, but we’ve seen division winners fall to wild card teams in the postseason before.</p>\n<p>First, they need to get to October, then they can hope to become the best. For right now, though, they certainly are a lot of fun to watch.</p>\n<p>Now onto the rest of today’s links.</p>\n\nRays infielder Taylor Walls has learned the value of journaling as part of his post-game routine. Story by Marc Topkin. \nSpeaking of the Rays, Jay Jaffe takes a look at their unexpected surge towards postseason contention. \nDaniel Chavkin offers some insight into the MLB and Manfred specifically recognizing the Minor League Players’ Union. \nJohn Denton and Jake Crouse spotlight Albert Pujols as he takes 4th place of all time. \n\nJust how close is Pujols to 700? ESPN breaks it down. \nSigh.\n\n\n\n<p>The first batter of the game, and Angel Hernandez is already at it again“I have never seen this call. It is a terrible call.” pic.twitter.com/C06xcYQy23</p>— Welcome to the Ump Show (@umpjob) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to own Ty Cobb’s dentures, now is your moment. Story by Ben Hooper.\nDaniel Kramer breaks down the amazing Sunday walk-off win for the Mariners and why it shows that they’re ready for October.\nFormer pitcher Anthony Varvaro died this weekend in a car crash on his way to work at the 9/11 memorial in New York. (AP)\n\nKen Rosenthal talks to Terry Francona about his future in baseball. (The Athletic subscription required.)\nThis is such a distinctly Scherzer kind of stat.\n\n\n\n<p>Max Scherzer, who is on the IL, got ejected by second-base ump Chad Fairchild in the first inning.This is the second time this year Scherzer has been ejected. He wasn't playing in either game.</p>— Tim Healey (@timbhealey) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dodgers are the first team to clinch a postseason berth, shares Shaun O’Neill. \nESPN offers a glimpse at which teams are likely to join the Dodgers in the postseason. \nSam Blum has a piece on Scott Spiezio, and his long road to recovery after World Series glory faded. (The Athletic subscription required.)\n\nHere’s another look at some of those rule changes we can expect in 2023. (AP)\nAnd here’s what MLB players and managers are saying about those changes. (The Athletic subscription required.)\nThis thread gets a bit unhinged but it’s also pretty illuminating.\n\n\n\n<p>I thought this might be an interesting way to visualize the new positioning rules. (Fixed an earlier error about outfielders.)This is it. This is all that matters. Setting aside P/C, you just have to have at least 4 infielders, and 2 on either side.So ... pic.twitter.com/rzGBzfp1by</p>— Mike Petriello (@mike_petriello) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>And tomorrow will be a better day, Buster.

        "description": "Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>After Saturday’s start, in which National League ERA leader Julio Urías pitched seven innings to beat San Diego, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts stumped for the left-hander, who did not make the All-Star team this season, to receive National League Cy Young Award consideration. Roberts, from Jack Harris at the Los Angeles Times, “His mentality is up there with some of the best that I’ve ever seen. ... To be quite honest, I think that Julio is using some of the lack of recognition as fuel. I think all players have some sense of what fuels them. And I believe this is part of his.”</p>\n<p>Among the items in Fabian Ardaya’s notes column at The Athletic is that Gavin Lux took swings in the batting cage over the weekend, but isn’t expected to play until the San Francisco series at the earliest. Wednesday will mark Lux’s 12th straight game missed with neck soreness.</p>\n<p>With the Dodgers lowering their magic number down to just two to win the National League West, they could potentially clinch the division as early as Tuesday. With the next setting at Chase Field in Phoenix, thoughts turn to 2013, when nearly the entire team ran to celebrate a division title in the right field pool. Clayton Kershaw reflected on the first of ten straight Dodgers playoff berths with Bill Plunkett of the Orange County Register.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, what I remember is that wasn’t even in our mindset,” Kershaw told Plunkett. “We didn’t have any intentions of doing that — until they said, ‘Do not jump in our pool.’ We were like, ‘No, you can’t tell us what to do.’”</p>\n<p>Harris at the LA Times chronicled the Dodgers’ subdued celebration Sunday once the Dodgers clinched a playoff berth.</p>\n<p>Sunday, on the Dodgers’ final extended road trip of the season, the Dodgers had their annual dress-up day. Some highlights shared online (the team Instagram post has several photos to scroll through):</p>\n\n\n<p>Your 2022 Los Angeles Dodgers. pic.twitter.com/JwiTsQx9nU</p>— Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) September 12, 2022\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n \n View this post on Instagram\n\n \n   \n\n  \n\n   \n\n   \n<p>A post shared by Los Angeles Dodgers (@dodgers)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Team Dress Up 2022   #ApolloCreed pic.twitter.com/B8QHzFc6M1</p>— Yency Almonte (@showtimealmonte) September 12, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Team dress up #Chippendales #Vegasbound @dodgers pic.twitter.com/tvje3PyLTE</p>— Justin Turner (@redturn2) September 12, 2022",

It’s a family film, though I suspect teenagers – and the smutty-minded (I confess to being one of them) – will smirk at the one-woman-and-her-dog bedroom scenes.</p><p>Bríd Ní Neachtain plays Róise: a widow who, two years on from the death of her husband, is still struggling to get out of bed each morning. Then, one day, a lurcher-terrier cross (fine mutt acting by Barley the dog) turns up on her doorstep. He seems to know things about her late husband, Frank: his favourite chair, the route of his morning walk. A vet puts the dog’s age at two. Aha! Frank has been dead for two years. So, she calls the dog Frank, feeds it steak and starts wearing makeup again.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p>A third of employed adults are concerned about exposure to COVID-19 at work, a figure that is relatively unchanged since the fall last year, according to a new Gallup poll.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new survey found only a 3-percentage-point drop from November, 2021, when 36 percent of workers expressed at least moderate concern for exposure to COVID-19 at work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The percentage has fallen, however, from the first six months of the pandemic in 2020. Roughly half of respondents were uneasy about exposure at work at the time, while the percentage of those saying they are “not concerned at all” has grown from 23 percent in 2020 to a record high of 39 percent in the latest polling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exposure concerns did not significantly vary by age, but the new survey did find a substantial gender gap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forty-one percent of working women worry significantly about COVID-19 exposure at work, compared to 26 percent of working men.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Respondents’ concerns also split along party lines, a disparity seen throughout the pandemic that has now widened more than at any other point. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just more than half of Democrats surveyed in the new poll — 51 percent — expressed at least moderate concern about work-related COVID-19 exposure, while just 26 percent of independents and 14 percent of Republicans agreed</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two-thirds of workers indicated they expect infections to increase this fall and winter. About a quarter — 26 percent — said they expected infections to increase a great deal, compared to 43 percent who said infections would increase a moderate amount and about a quarter who thought it would remain the same.Just 6 percent said they expect infections to decrease to any extent this fall and winter, the poll found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A slight majority expressed worry about new strains of COVID-19, and fewer than half were confident that vaccines will protect people from newer variants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The poll was conducted before Americans started receiving booster shots designed to target omicron variants. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in recent weeks have approved the new shots, marking the first time the vaccines have been updated since the start of the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top White House health officials, including Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, have indicated people will likely need annual COVID-19 booster shots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gallup poll was conducted between July 26 and Aug. 2 with a random sample of 3,682 adults, including 1,274 workers. Gallup weighted the sample to match national demographics, and the margin of error is 3 percentage points.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Bryan Cereijo/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Your Monday morning dose of New York Mets and MLB news, notes, and links. </p> Meet the Mets\n\n<p>If you woke up on Sunday morning thinking “the Mets should easily defeat the Marlins and also Tomas Nido should hit his first home run of the season”, that afternoon’s 9-3 win over the Marlins with Tomas Nido’s first home run must’ve been pretty cool. </p>\n<p>Choose your recap: Amazin’ Avenue, NY Post, Daily News, MLB.com, Newsday, ESPN. </p>\n<p>With gripping the ball being an ongoing issue with Starling Marte’s broken finger, he opted to go on the injured list. </p>\n<p>The Mets will put up Chris Bassitt, Jacob deGrom, and a pitcher who may or may not be David Peterson in their series against the Cubs. </p>\n<p>Though it’s a little late in the season, the Eduardo Escobar resurgence is very much appreciated by the Mets. </p>\n<p>Max Scherzer threw his first bullpen session since getting placed on the injured list and...it went well and normal. </p>\n<p>During the game, Scherzer had to watch the rest of Sunday’s contest from the clubhouse after his second bench ejection of the season. </p>\n<p>Trevor May’s return should come at some point today, if things stay as they are. </p>\n<p>In the third bit of good injury-recovery news, Luis Guillorme should join the Mets either today or tomorrow at Citi Field. </p>\n<p>Okay, if three isn’t enough for you, the fourth good piece of news is that Joey Lucchesi went 1.2 scoreless innings in his second rehab appearance.</p>\n<p>As the playoffs draw closer, it makes more and more sense for Brandon Nimmo’s time in New York to extend beyond next month.  </p>\n<p>Sometimes we all just need to take a step back and think about how bad Angel Hernandez is and laugh. </p>\nAround the National League East\n<p>Port Authority police officer and former Atlanta Braves pitcher Anthony Vavaro died in a traffic collision on Sunday morning while en route to a 9/11 memorial service. </p>\n<p>Following a historic rain delay lasting nearly four hours, the Phillies defeated the Nationals in a damp 7-5 contest in Philly. </p>\n<p>A 6-1 Mariners lead in the seventh became a 7-6 Braves lead in the ninth before eventually settling at an 8-7 victory for the Mariners over the dreaded Braves. </p>\nAround Major League Baseball\n<p>MLB and the MLBPA determined who is eligible to join the minor league union and which few exceptions get left out.</p>\n<p>Continuing his destruction during the final month of his career, Albert Pujols connected for his 697th career home run, passing Alex Rodriguez and gaining sole possession of fourth place on the all time list. </p>\n<p>The lucky fans who caught homer 697 met with Albert Pujols after the game and the future Hall of Famer took a picture, let them keep the home run ball, and signed two additional baseballs saying that the ball would mean more to them than it would to him. </p>\n<p>The division title is technically still up in the air, but the Dodgers are the first team to officially qualify to make the postseason.</p>\n<p>With rookie hazing a thing of the past, the Dodgers used one of their final flights of the year to get everyone dressed up like assorted wackos and weirdos. </p>\n<p>One day after recording his 12th win of the season, Shohei Ohtani connected for his 34th home run of the season. Lmao, lol, things of that nature. </p>\n<p>While in Oakland for Dave Stewart’s number retirement, Tony LaRussa revealed that he may not be coming back to the White Sox dugout this year.   </p>\n<p>Argued to be a sport too entrenched in the past, for better or worse, baseball is trying to move itself into the future. </p>\n<p>Not only will MLB’s new rules change the way the game is played, but it will also change the makeup of who on the roster gets to play. </p>\n<p>Zac Gallen set a new Diamondbacks franchise record with 44.1 consecutive scoreless innings before giving up his first run in weeks on Sunday. </p>\nThis Date in Mets History\n<p>On this date in 1964, the New York Jets played their first game at Shea Stadium. </p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Aaron Judge could face the Astros in the postseason. There are some reasons to be optimistic if that happens.</p> <p>Except for a huge last-minute debacle, the Yankees and the Astros are going to be in the postseason and they could face each other at one point of October. The Yankees’ biggest weapon is the best hitter baseball has had in 2022: Aaron Judge. Through Saturday, Judge was leading his league in home runs (55), RBIs (120), runs (112), walks (87), OPS (1.095), total bases (342), and a few more departments.</p>\n<p>If both teams collide again before the World Series, one popular question on the Astros’ side will be how to stop Judge. And that’s a really tough question, whose answer has been almost impossible to find since opening day. When you’re facing an apparently flawless hitter, you need to take advantage of everything you can and be aware of little details.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Judge does have some flaws – even though they’re almost invisible. If you like being optimistic, here’s a little but interesting piece: he’s striking out every four plate appearances (25.5 SO%). Besides, he’s less lethal when attacked outside in the strike zone as you can see in the graphics below (from catcher’s perspective)…</p>\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n<p>Despite Judge hitting two of his 55 home runs against the Astros, Houston has done really good against the Yankee threat this season. In seven games and 31 plate appearances, the 30-year-old outfielder is 4-for-27 with eight strikeouts against the ‘Stros’ pitchers.</p>\n<p>It also seems that Judge has recently felt the pressure of playing in October. In his last 12 postseason games –a span that includes the final four games of the 2019 American League Championship Series against the Astros–, Judge has posted a .160/.246/.340 slash line with only eight hits over 50 at-bats.</p>\n<p>But in case Judge’s unbelievable season keeps going in the playoffs and the Yankees face the Astros at some point, here’s another good news: throughout his career, Judge has gone 16-for-79 against all current Astros’ pitchers with 31 strikeouts and a .203/.315/.430 line – has not faced Hunter Brown and Will Smith.</p>\n<p>Judge is 5-for-51 with 19 punchouts combined in his career against Justin Verlander, Lance McCullers Jr., Rafael Montero, Luis García, Cristian Javier, Héctor Neris, and José Urquidy.</p>\n<p>So, you can say the Astros do know how to stop Aaron Judge. If they meet again in the postseason, it will likely be a huge, fun, must-watch series.</p>",

        "description": "Matt Marton-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>The Cubs dropped Sunday night’s game, and the series, to the Giants.</p> <p>If you watched Sunday’s Chicago Bears NFL season opener, you know that it rained most of Sunday afternoon in Chicago — hard, in some areas, there was significant street flooding on parts of the North Side.</p>\n<p>In the area around Wrigley Field (which avoided any flooding), the rain stopped right about the time the gates opened to the ballpark at 5 p.m. (There were a few annoying little sprinkles during the game, but not hard enough to hold up play.)</p>\n<p>It might as well have kept raining, because the Cubs lost Sunday 4-2 to the Giants, ending their homestand with a losing 2-4 mark. The loss, the team’s 82nd of the year, clinched a losing season for the second straight year after six consecutive winning seasons from 2015-20. It also dropped the team to a season-low 24 games under .500 (58-82).</p>\n<p>Wade Miley, who had a successful return from the injured list last Tuesday, again threw well Sunday night. He allowed just one run in five innings, with five strikeouts, the only mar to his outing that single run in the fourth.</p>\n<p>The Cubs tied the game in the fifth. Zach McKinstry — who wound up with a career-high four hits on the night — led off with a double. Rafael Ortega singled him in [VIDEO].</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>It’s kind of fun watching Bobby Valentine’s lips flap while the Score’s Zach Zaidman makes the PBP call on that hit.</p>\n<p>Hayden Wesneski relieved Miley and his second MLB outing wasn’t as good as his first. He served up two home run balls, a solo shot by Thairo Estrada in the seventh that gave the Giants a 2-1 lead, and a two-run homer (following a walk) by Wilmer Flores that put San Francisco up 4-1.</p>\n<p>Wesneski wound up throwing 88 pitches (59 strikes) and looked good at times, but that’s a lot of pitches for not quite completing four innings. Wesneski allowed a two-out single in the ninth and David Ross called on Rowan Wick to finish that inning, which he did with a strikeout.</p>\n<p>Still, Wesneski obviously will get more chances for the rest of this year, perhaps even a start or two.</p>\n<p>Seiya Suzuki brought the Cubs to within 4-2 with this mammoth home run in the eighth [VIDEO].</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Did I say mammoth? That ball was crushed!</p>\n\n\n<p>Seiya Suzuki vs Scott Alexander#ItsDifferentHereHome Run  Exit velo: 107.8 mphLaunch angle: 24 degProj. distance: 435 ftNo doubt about that one  That's a dinger in all 30 MLB ballparks  SF (4) @ CHC (2)  8th pic.twitter.com/Zl90sXXla7</p>— Would it dong? (@would_it_dong) September 12, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>I like what I have seen from Suzuki lately. So do others:</p>\n\n\n<p>That's his best swing maybe all season? He absolutely drilled that pitch right/center. Really great sign.</p>— Brendan Miller (@brendan_cubs) September 12, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I was thinking the same. He's been awesome the last month... swinging with much more conviction and has made a lot of adjustments.</p>— Matt Clapp (@TheBlogfines) September 12, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>I look for big things from Suzuki for next year.</p>\n<p>The Cubs had two more baserunners in the inning, but Nelson Velázquez hit into a force play to end the eighth.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the ninth, Yan Gomes was hit by a pitch to lead off the inning, but was erased on a double play. McKinstry followed with his fourth hit, and then Patrick Wisdom hit a ground ball and was called out on a close play at first. The Cubs asked for a review — why not, at that point? — but the review crew must have said, “It’s after 11 here in New York, are you kidding us?”</p>\n\n\n<p>Btm 9th - Crew Chief reviews call that Patrick Wisdom is out at 1B; call confirmed, runner is out.

Here’s why:</p>\n\n\n<p>Cubs shortstop Nico Hoerner exited tonight’s game at Wrigley Field with right triceps tightness.</p>— Patrick Mooney (@PJ_Mooney) September 12, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>That might have happened on this play in the third inning [VIDEO].</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Hopefully that’s nothing serious and the Cubs were just taking precautions with Hoerner on a chilly evening (60 degrees at game time, the coolest game-time temp since June 1, when it was 59).</p>\n<p>Sunday night’s game concluded the Cubs’ 2022 appearances on TV channels other than Marquee Sports Network. They played 16 games on those channels this year with the following records (overall, 7-9):</p>\n<p>Fox: 3-2ESPN: 0-4Apple TV+: 3-1Peacock: 1-0YouTube: 0-2</p>\n<p>I present this for no reason other than your information, and mostly just to let you know the game count — 16. That means 146 Cubs games this year will be carried by Marquee.</p>\n<p>The Cubs will make a quick one-series road trip this week to play the Mets at Citi Field. The series begins Monday evening with Javier Assad facing the Mets’ Chris Bassitt. Game time tonight is 6:10 p.m. CT and TV coverage will be via Marquee Sports Network.</p>\n<p></p>",

Our intrepid correspondent gets lost</p><p>I’m at the Venice film festival, in a hyper-real city square, surrounded by lapping blue water and tourists who move in mysterious ways. There is a ginger cat here called Dorian who walks on his hind legs and speaks with a French accent. Dorian is showing us how to walk and turn and jump and crouch. He’s concerned by the tourist who can’t get herself off the ground. Dorian explains that if we ever get lost we should press the “respawn” button which will put us right back where we began. He sighs heavily and says: “Sooner or later everybody gets lost.”</p><p>It is the fear of getting lost – this terror of the unknown – that scares many punters away from Venice Immersive, which sits behind the big Mussolini-era casino that hosts the film festival proper. That and the boat ride, the headsets, the schedule, the stress. The movies on the main programme: they’re largely a known quantity. Whereas the “extended reality” exhibits out on VI island are almost too much to process; we lack even the grammar and the language to frame them. To misquote Bob Dylan, something is happening here – but no one, it seems, can definitively say what it is.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>The season is slipping away from the upstart Birds, but with a bright future there are still storylines worth watching in the final weeks.</p> <p>There is still a chance for the Orioles to make the playoffs. That chance is slim, and it would be inadvisable to bet on such a circumstance, but it’s possible. That represents a drastic shift in tone from just a week ago, when the Orioles had a big four-game set against the Blue Jays ahead of them, and fans were dreaming of a magical October run. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the Orioles proceeded to have a nightmarish week, losing three out of four to said Blue Jays and then two of three to the last-place Red Sox. With just 22 games left on the schedule, the current 5.5-game gap between them and the final AL wild card spot feels impossible to close.</p>\n<p>We understand that this team was “supposed” to be bad, but that doesn’t matter much at this point. The reality is that they have actually been among the best teams in baseball since May 1, and they even worked their way into a playoff spot on multiple occasions. It was all there for the taking, so it is disappointing to see those chances go up in smoke.</p>\n<p>When it is all said and done, the Orioles fanbase is going to walk away from this season with positive feelings. There will be legitimate gripes about Rougned Odor’s continued presence in the everyday lineup, or the refusal to play Kyle Stowers against left-handed pitching, but those are the exception rather than the rule. The 2022 season has been a blast, regardless of the ultimate outcome.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the flaws of this Orioles team have always been plain to see: offensive black holes at several spots in the lineup, starting pitching that has been surprisingly stable while lacking an ace, an effective but shallow bullpen, and room to upgrade at key positions. </p>\n<p>Years ago, those would have been minor problems. The team was rebuilding. We were learning about the talent within the organization. Of course there was room for improvement. It’s all part of the process.</p>\n<p>But things have changed. This campaign serves as the official turning point for the organization. The rebuild is over, and the core of a playoff team is in place. It’s time for bigger aspirations for the club and bigger expectations from the fans.</p>\n<p>Mike Elias acknowledged those feelings just after the trade deadline, saying it was “liftoff from here for this team.” Later on, he expanded on that thought, laying out a plan to “significantly escalate the payroll” over the winter through arbitration, free agency, and trades. </p>\n<p>We will learn what exactly that means in due time. But for now, it could be useful to use the final few weeks of this season as an opportunity to remove the orange-tinted glasses, watch the Orioles as a cold-hearted, calculating GM, and think about how this team could be overhauled to take advantage of what could be a special core of talent.</p>\n<p>Here are a few spots to watch:</p>\nAn overcrowded outfield\n<p>The Orioles have too much talent for too few spots in the outfield. The trio that took the field on Opening Day remains in place, and there are younger reinforcements ready for an opportunity. This feels like an area where something has to give, but it’s anyone’s guess as to how Mike Elias handles things. </p>\n<p>You could rationalize just about any scenario. Trading away Anthony Santander at the peak of his value makes sense, but so does keeping him around as one of the few power threats on this roster. Colton Cowser is a top prospect whose path to the big leagues should be cleared, but he might also fetch one heck of a pitcher on the trade market.</p>\n<p>The player in this mix that may be easiest to move on from is Austin Hays given the other talent the team has at or near the big league level. The 27-year-old hits arbitration for the first time this winter, and is in the midst of a tough second half to the season. Despite his struggles there should be value on the trade market given his years of team control and track record. </p>\nAn opening at second base\n<p>Odor will not be back with the Orioles in 2023. The veteran has provided a necessary shock to the team’s clubhouse culture, and for that he will be invited to the inevitable World Series parade. But a 75 OPS+ is not good enough to be an everyday player on a team with hopes of making a World Series run.</p>\n<p>According to The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal, the Orioles plan for their infield in 2023 is to make Gunnar Henderson their everyday third baseman and to keep Jorge Mateo at shortstop. But there is no clear answer to the void at second base.</p>\n<p>The free agent options are lacking unless one of the big-name shortstops is willing to pull a Trevor Story and switch over to second base for the time being. Provided that doesn’t happen, the leading internal option appears to be prospect Jordan Westburg.</p>\n<p>Westburg is in the midst of a fine September with Triple-A Norfolk. Over 11 games he has an .876 OPS, and perhaps he could still get a cup of coffee in the big leagues before the year is out. But the Orioles likely prefer the roster flexibility at this point. </p>\n<p>Westburg does not need to be protected from the Rule 5 draft this winter, so adding him now would limit their ability to protect others, like Joey Ortiz. Injuries have slowed Ortiz’s development, but he has had a nice season split between Bowie and Norfolk. Over 12 games with the latter, Ortiz is 19-for-48 with two home runs and four doubles. If the Orioles were going to promote anyone to get reps at second base before the season is out, Ortiz would probably make more sense.</p>\nSorting out the rotation\n<p>Grayson Rodriguez would already be several months into his big league career if the issue with his right lat had not popped up earlier this summer. Instead, he is racing the clock to rehab in time for a debut with the Orioles before the season concludes. </p>\n<p>As of this writing, the top pitching prospect in baseball has made two rehab appearances with Double-A Bowie and is expected to move to Triple-A Norfolk for at least one more outing before a call to Baltimore would be on the table.</p>\n<p>Provided that all goes well, Rodriguez is poised to open the 2023 season as a member of the big league rotation, but who exactly would be around him on the staff is a bit of a mystery. </p>\n<p>The turnaround of the Orioles starting pitching is one of the biggest reasons that this team has been so competitive this season. It hasn’t been a dominant staff, but it has been competitive, which represents a significant step forward.</p>\n<p>However, they need to take an even bigger leap if they are going to match the heightened aspirations of the team. That could mean changes are coming despite the unexpected performances. </p>\n<p>If you pencil in Rodriguez and assume that the Orioles will make a free agent splash for someone like Carlos Rodon, then that leaves three spots for Tyler Wells, Dean Kremer, Austin Voth, D.L. Hall, Kyle Bradish, and Jordan Lyles, not to mention an eventual return of John Means. Who are the odd men out?</p>\n<p>That conversation is worth its own blog, and you can be sure that it will be dissected a million ways before spring rolls back around. But it does illustrate that starting pitching has suddenly become something of a strength for the Orioles, at least from a depth perspective. Tough decisions are coming at that position as well.</p>\n<p>There won’t be a game without meaning for the remainder of the 2022 season. Even if the Orioles do eventually fall out of the playoff conversation entirely, there are still things to learn about this current crop of players ahead of one of the most important offseasons in recent memory.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Prospect news and statistics from the Rockies minor league affiliates from September 5-11, 2022 </p> <p>A week after the short-season affiliates wrapped up their seasons, it was time for one of the Colorado Rockies full-season affiliates to do the same. The Spokane Indians finished their season on the road, dropping four-of-six games against Tri-City. The Indians fell just short in their push for the playoffs the week prior, but finished with a very respectable 64-66 overall record. </p>\n<p>While the games will go on for the Albuquerque Isotopes and Fresno Grizzlies, it was still an important week for their record books. </p>\n<p>After taking four games against San Jose (SF), the Grizzlies have their eyes set on a playoff matchup against those same Giants. But Adael Amador (No. 17 PuRP) had a moment in the spotlight before the pennant chase begins, drawing his 87th walk of the season. That base-on-balls tied Amador with Damon Miller’s 2000 season for the most walks in a single season in Grizzlies’ history.</p>\n\n\n<p>CONGRATULATIONS to Grizzlies SS and @Rockies #3 prospect Adael Amador, who is now tied for the most walks in Grizzlies single-season history! Amador has 87 walks (Damon Minor, 2000)! @MiLB @MLBPipeline  ⚾️  #RaisetheBear pic.twitter.com/EVDO8sNwov</p>— Fresno Grizzlies (@FresnoGrizzlies) September 12, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>For the Isotopes, they had a tough time against El Paso (SD) with five-of-six games dropped against the Chihuahuas. There were good feelings to be had though, thanks to the resurgent bat of 1B D.J. Peterson on Thursday night. Peterson’s grand slam set a franchise record as the team’s 213th home run of the season. But it didn’t stop there, as the long-ball was Albuquerque’s 13th grand slam of the season, tying the 1995 Indianapolis Indians for the most in Minor League history.</p>\n\n\n<p>HISTORY HAS BEEN MADE, TWICE ON ONE SWING!D.J.

Logan Allen was not part of the problem, however. In his lone start, Allen tossed five innings with a solo homer counting for the lone run and hit against him. Karl Kauffmann (No. 20 PuRP) had an up-and-down start with five runs allowed in 5 ⅔ innings but registering an impressive 11 strikeouts along the way.</p>\n<p>At the plate, Wynton Bernard continued making the PCL look easy with an 11-for-28 series, including two doubles and a homer. Ryan Vilade (No. 8 PuRP) also delivered a strong series, notching 10 hits. Sam Hilliard matched Vilade in hits, sending two over the wall while also driving-in six.</p>\n<p>Double-A: Hartford Yard Goats (1-5, 73-58 overall)</p>\n<p>The Hartford offense struggled to find consistency, posting two runs or less in half of their games against Somerset (NYY). Grant Lavigne (No. 22 PuRP) was the bright spot of the lineup, leading the team with seven hits, five RBI and ten total bases while also collecting his 10th homer of the season. Three of Hunter Stovall’s six hits were doubles while Isaac Collins had five hits and five runs scored in 12 at-bats.</p>\n<p>On the hill, Noah Davis (No. 19 PuRP) had another strong start with seven strikeouts and one run allowed in 5 ⅔ innings. Joe Rock (No. 16 PuRP) made his Yard Goats debut, striking out six in four innings.</p>\nHigh-A: Spokane Indians (2-4, 64-66 overall)\n<p>Chris McMahon (No. 9 PuRP) continued to put his lat injury in the rear-view mirror, allowing just one run over five innings without issuing a walk. Mason Green also surrendered just one run in 5 ⅓ innings while Anderson Amarista delivered the best start of the week with one earned run in 6 ⅔ innings.</p>\n<p>The Spokane bats struggled to defy the pitcher-friendly Northwest League with Cuba Bess hitting the lone home run. But there were strong performances by Nic Kent and Robby Martin Jr. Kent had a team-high eight hits, three of which went for doubles. Martin, meanwhile, had the highest OPS (1.247) and RBI (4) of the squad.</p>\nFresno Grizzlies (4-2, 82-49 overall)\n<p>Benny Montgomery (No. 2 PuRP) continued to swing a hot bat for the Grizzlies. Montgomery finished with a .455/.520/1.388 slash line, drove-in seven runs and hit five doubles in the series. Three of his five doubles came in one game, marking the first time a Fresno hitter did that since Yadiel Hernandez in 2019. Sterlin Thompson had eight hits against the Giants, including his first home run with the Grizzlies. Jordan Beck, another 2022 draft pick, also homered in the series.</p>\n<p>Speaking of 2022 draftees, Friday marked the Low-A debut of first round selection Gabriel Hughes.

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Childrens’ mental and behavioral health have suffered during the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new report looks at insurance claims data from 2016 to 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a 61 percent increase in mental health related inpatient admissions and 20 percent increase in emergency department visits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Mental health in children and teenagers has suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. surgeon general issued an advisory at the end of 2021 warning about a mental health crisis in youth. A 2020 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that mental health related emergency department visits in children started increasing in April of that year and stayed high through October. A new report from Clarify Health Institute, the research arm of payments platform company Clarify Health, breaks down the data covering 2016 through 2021 for mental health related insurance claims for children ages 1 to 19. Overall, there were increases in most claims related to mental health, sometimes very sharp increases starting in 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The data includes claims for about 20 million children annually from 2016 through 2021, so approximately covering the first two years of the coronavirus pandemic. The records include inpatient admissions as well as emergency department visits and outpatient/office professional visits. Inpatient admissions typically mean that the patient needs to stay overnight, whereas for outpatient visits they do not. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, there was a 61 percent increase in mental health inpatient admissions from 30 to 48 visits annually per 1,000 patients. There was a 20 percent increase in emergency department (ED) visits from 55 to 66 visits annually per 1,000 patients. </p>\n\n\n\nCourtesy of Clarity Health Institute\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the mental and behavioral health conditions in the analysis include depressive disorders, other mood disorders, anxiety disorders, stress disorders, feeding and eating disorders and suicidal ideation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By age groups, teenagers aged 12 to 15 and 16 to 19 fared worse than the younger age groups. Girls aged 12 to 15 had an 84 percent increase for inpatient admissions per 1,000 patients, and boys in the same age group saw an 83 percent increase. ED visits increased by 41 percent for girls and 38 percent for boys in this age group. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report authors also broke the data out by region. The middle Atlantic region saw the largest increase of 137 percent more inpatient utilization of mental health services. The next highest was New England (100 percent increase), followed by West South Central (81 percent increase; which includes Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana). </p>\n\n\n\nCourtesy of Clarity Health Institute\n\n\n\n<p>Comparing commercial insurance users to Medicaid users, claims to commercial insurance increased more rapidly than for Medicaid. Historically, inpatient mental health claims in children are higher in Medicaid users, but in 2021 the inpatient usage in the commercial insurance population surpassed Medicaid. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The trends illuminated in this report reinforce healthcare leaders’ responsibility to address children’s mental health, especially when considering that half of all mental health conditions onset during adolescence and carry into adulthood,” says Jean Drouin, MD, CEO and Co-Founder, Clarity Health in a press release. “With a growing consensus that mental, behavioral and physical health intersect, this research report aims to spark a conversation about the overall wellbeing of America’s next generation.” </p>",

        "description": "<p>Democrats are experiencing newfound momentum with less than two months until the midterm elections — but how can they ensure it lasts through November? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of a doom-and-gloom outlook — as most were predicting that 2022 would be a repeat of the 1994 and 2010 midterms, where the party lost 53 and 63 seats, respectively — Democrats have been dealt some encouraging news as of late.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They now lead in the generic vote for Congress by 4 points after trailing Republicans for most of the year. Nearly one-half (48 percent) of registered voters say they would vote for a Democrat, compared to 44 percent for a Republican, per recent Marist College polling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, in five special elections for Congress, Democrats have outperformed expectations by an average of 11 points since Roe v. Wade was overturned — most recently in Alaska’s 1st district where Mary Peltola became the first Democrat to win the seat in more than 50 years — indicating that the issue of protecting abortion rights could help Democrats win in competitive districts in November. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, Democrats clearly are still vulnerable for one major reason: inflation remains high, and Americans are still bearing the burden of paying higher prices for goods and gasoline. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, while most voters clearly support protecting abortion rights in a vacuum, these voters do not necessarily prioritize electing Democrats who support protecting abortion rights over Republicans who promise to reduce the cost of living. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Democrats will not be able to do anything over the next eight weeks that will reduce inflation on its face, the party can show voters — through a renewed focus on health care costs — that they are attuned to their daily financial hardships and focused on solutions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, by using health care as an umbrella issue — both as it relates to lowering costs and ensuring quality health care for women — Democrats can position themselves as the only party that is committed to alleviating the high cost of living burden while also protecting a woman’s right to choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Democrats’ recent spending bill sought to address healthcare costs by allowing Medicare to negotiate the prices of prescription drugs, this policy is unfortunately flawed. It will end up raising prices for privately insured Americans and hurting Medicare patients’ access to life-saving medications, though these negative effects will not be felt until well after the midterms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, the final Democratic spending package, dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act, expanded subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, a policy that is now widely popular with the broader electorate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, Democrats’ push during the bill negotiations to pass a $35 insulin cap for non-Medicare patients was a savvy political move — even though it was ultimately unsuccessful — as it forced Republicans to go on record voting against a policy that would cut costs for millions of Americans with diabetes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, from a communications perspective, Democrats can make the case to voters that they have been making a concerted effort to cut costs and expand access to healthcare, while Republicans have been working to raise prices and restrict access. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, Democrats in vulnerable swing districts can and should weaponize the G.O.P.’s opposition to the $35 insulin cap in the coming months in order to make the case that Republicans do not have Americans’ best financial or personal interests at heart. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, in order to show voters that the party has a plan to lower health care costs if they retain control of Congress, Democrats can propose a new policy that would lower prescription drug prices for Americans by eliminating the middlemen in drug programs. Removing these middlemen, known as pharmacy benefit managers, would eliminate markups and price hikes on prescription drugs, making medications more affordable for patients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, by putting a renewed focus on health care as a general issue ahead of the midterms, Democrats can strengthen their case for protecting abortion rights, which is already shaping up to be a powerful issue for the party.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polling conducted by my firm, Schoen Cooperman Research, and others since the announcement that Roe would be overturned has consistently found that public support for abortion is strongest when it is framed as a health care issue — more so than as a choice or equality issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, our poll found that two-thirds of likely November 2022 voters are compelled to support protecting abortion rights when it is framed as essential to ensuring quality health care for women. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, making health care a focal issue of their fall campaign will allow the party to capitalize on — and grow — the current abortion rights momentum, helping secure Democratic victories in statewide swing-state races and competitive swing districts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this strategic pivot to health care, Democrats may be able to outperform expectations in the midterms to the extent — or to an even greater extent — than most are predicting now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Douglas E. Schoen is a political consultant who served as an adviser to President Clinton and to the 2020 presidential campaign of Michael Bloomberg. His new book is “The End of Democracy?

        "description": "Lindsey Wasson-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>A number of the Yankees’ AL East rivals fell on Sunday, while Seattle pulled off a remarkable win.</p> <p>There were actual good vibes in the Bronx this weekend, with the Yankees looking as strong as they have in weeks. The actual quality play, coupled with the prospect of possible returns from injury in the coming days, offers the possibility of a decent run from the Bombers. In any event, it was a fun day of action across the AL, as the playoff picture continued to become clearer and clearer. Here’s what went down. </p>\n\nTexas Rangers 4 (60-79), Toronto Blue Jays 1 (78-61)\n\n<p>Toronto couldn’t quite close out the sweep in Texas, dropping the series finale in somewhat listless fashion. The Jays could manage only an RBI double from Teoscar Hernández against the Rangers staff as Martín Pérez continued his resurgent season, tossing six innings of one-run ball to secure his 11th win of 2022.</p>\n<p>Nathaniel Lowe stayed hot, going 3-for-4 and driving in a run, while Adolis García paced the offense with a two-run homer off Yusei Kikuchi in the third:</p>\n\n<p>The Texas bullpen had no problem holding the win for Perez, with Matt Moore notably continuing his shockingly great year in relief, pitching a scoreless eighth and lowering his ERA to 2.15. Toronto remains in strong position in the AL Wild Card race, 5.5 games ahead of Baltimore for the final spot (though they’re six back of the Yankees in the AL East, and half a game behind the Rays).</p>\n\nHouston Astros 12 (90-50), Los Angeles Angels 4 (61-79)\n\n<p>This was the final game of a nice little AL West jaunt for Houston, one in which they played four consecutive series against the Angels and Rangers. They went 10-2 in that stretch, securing their 90th win of the season on Sunday and keeping right on track for the AL’s top seed. </p>\n<p>The Angels actually jumped all over Luis Garcia, taking an early 3-0 lead, thanks in part to Shohei Ohtani’s 34th homer of the year. But it was all Astros from there. with Houston scoring at least three runs in three separate frames. Alex Bregman, Yordan Alvarez, Trey Mancini, Kyle Tucker and Mauricio Dubón all went deep. Tucker Davidson and and Mike Mayers were the main recipients of the pain, with Davidson yielding four runs in two innings, and Mayers letting up five across 3.1 innings. </p>\n\n\nSeattle Mariners 8 (79-61), Atlanta Braves 7 (87-53)\n\n<p>This was one of the wilder games of the year, one that saw a comeback, a collapse, and redemption in rapid succession. At the end of it, Atlanta had dropped ground in the race for the NL East, and the Mariners continued to consolidate their grip on a playoff spot. </p>\n<p>For some time, though, it seemed like this would be a pretty straightforward Seattle win. Marco Gonzales fired six innings of one-run ball, allowing just two hits and striking out five. Julio Rodríguez and Eugenio Suárez each homered in support of Gonzales, and J.P. Crawford’s RBI double in the sixth put the M’s up comfortably 6-1. </p>\n<p>Then the Michael Harris II show began. The rookie smacked a solo shot in the eighth to chip in to the deficit, and then smashed a three-run bomb in the ninth to narrow Seattle’s lead to 6-5:</p>\n\n\n<p>.@MoneyyyMikeee's second home run of the day was a NO DOUBTER  #ForTheA pic.twitter.com/SC1wmtRoZt</p>— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie Grossman followed with a two-run dinger of his own, and all of a sudden, Atlanta had pulled into the lead. </p>\n<p>The Braves turned to Kenley Jensen to close out an unlikely win. The veteran’s struggles continued, as Rodríguez and Suárez each hit their second homers of the game. Rodríguez’s homer tied the game:</p>\n\n<p>And Suárez ended the game:</p>\n\n<p>In an instance, defeat was snatched from the jaws of victory, and back again. With the win, Seattle moved to a solid six games clear in the Wild Card race.</p>\nOther Contenders\n\n\nBoston Red Sox 1 (69-72), Baltimore Orioles 0 (73-68): Some whiplash from Saturday’s 17-4 game to this one, with the Red Sox narrowly pulling this one out and putting another dent in the Orioles’ playoff chances. Boston went ahead on a sac fly in the first inning, and proceeded to post zeroes from there. Rich Hill tossed five shutout for the win, handing Kyle Bradish a tough-luck loss for his one-run, two-hit, seven-inning outing. \n\nCleveland Guardians 6 (73-65), Minnesota Twins 4 (69-70): Cleveland picked up another big win, their third in a row as they pulled 2.5 games ahead of Chicago in the AL Central. Shane Bieber fired 6.1 innings of one-run ball, while Andres Gimenez and Steven Kwan each homered to do enough to get Bieber the win. The Twins are going to have an awfully tough time coming back from this, as they’re now 4.5 back (not to mention under .500).\n\nOakland Athletics 10 (51-90), Chicago White Sox 3 (72-69): Chicago missed a chance at a crucial four-game sweep of Oakland, having to settle for three out of four after Oakland broke out on Sunday. Vimael Machin and Tony Kemp each drove in three runs, while Johnny Cueto had one of his worst starts with the White Sox, allowing seven runs across 4.2 innings. \n\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>The Venice film festival section Venice Immersive is dedicated to ‘extended reality’, where visitors can explore new narrative worlds. Our intrepid correspondent gets lost</p><p>I’m at the Venice film festival, in a hyper-real city square, surrounded by lapping blue water and tourists who move in mysterious ways. There is a ginger cat here called Dorian who walks on his hind legs and speaks with a French accent. Dorian is showing us how to walk and turn and jump and crouch. He’s concerned by the tourist who can’t get herself off the ground. Dorian explains that if we ever get lost we should press the “respawn” button which will put us right back where we began. He sighs heavily and says: “Sooner or later everybody gets lost.”</p><p>It is the fear of getting lost – this terror of the unknown – that scares many punters away from Venice Immersive, which sits behind the big Mussolini-era casino that hosts the film festival proper. That and the boat ride, the headsets, the schedule, the stress. The movies on the main programme: they’re largely a known quantity. Whereas the “extended reality” exhibits out on VI island are almost too much to process; we lack even the grammar and the language to frame them. To misquote Bob Dylan, something is happening here – but no one, it seems, can definitively say what it is.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Young pitchers provided some highlights during a rough week for the Red Sox. </p> <p>It’s Week-In-Review time! Here’s what was happening in Red Sox Nation, 9/5/22 - 9/11/22.</p>\n<p>Record</p>\n<p>2-4</p>\n<p>The Red Sox’s AL East woes continued this week as they dropped four of six to Baltimore and Tampa Bay. They are now 20-40 vs. opponents from within the division, 48-32 against everyone else. We all knew this division would be tough to compete in but I didn’t imagine the Sox would handle that challenge this poorly. </p>\n<p>Run Differential</p>\n<p>+7</p>\n<p>This is a misleading number boosted by a 17-run outing against the Orioles on Saturday that made up a majority of their scoring for the week. They averaged two runs per game in the other five contests. </p>\n<p>Player of the Week</p>\n<p>The Red Sox might have lost every game that Zack Kelly pitched in this week but that wasn’t his fault. He didn’t give up a run over 3.2 innings pitched over three appearances. He posted an opposing batting average of .083 and lowered his season ERA to 2.70 for the season. He gave up his first runs of the season 10 days ago, but Kelly has been out ever since. </p>\n<p>Connor Wong had high praise for Kelly’s change-up in particular. </p>\n<p>“(It’s) something else. I haven’t had to hit against it but I can only imagine. Some of the swings he gets on that thing are just unreal. So I can imagine it’s a nightmare at the plate”</p>\n<p>Play of the Week</p>\n<p>Trevor Story is an absurd defender, reason No. 346:</p>\n\n\n<p>It's a glove Story! pic.twitter.com/NRvOZ8GVnz</p>— Red Sox (@RedSox) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Nemesis of the Week</p>\n<p>Randy Arozorena was a tough out for Red Sox pitching during their three-game stint in Tampa Bay this week. He went 5-11 with three doubles, a homer and four RBIs — at least one in each game against the Sox, all wins — and reached base safely in 50% of his at-bats. </p>\n<p>Favorite Red Sox Content </p>\n<p>Brayan Bello made a couple of appearances on Pitching Ninja this week and I ate it up. Bello has been my favorite Red Sox prospect to watch, even before he made it to the Majors. His stuff is electric and he’s starting to throw with more confidence now. You can see it not just in the pitch selection over his last few outings but in the way he’s carrying himself on the mound. I can’t say for certain what the rotation will look like in 2023 but I hope he’s a part of it. </p>\n\n\n<p>Brayan Bello, Dirty Changeups.    pic.twitter.com/Yi3ZZCkiou</p>— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) September 9, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Bold Prediction for Next Week</p>\n<p>The Red Sox earn a two-game sweep against the Yankees behind good starts from Nick Pivetta and Bello. I think the offense rebounds from a tough week and the Sox will continue to play the struggling Yankees close. I love watching some of the kids get major league experience but I’d also like to play spoiler with the division in play. </p>\n<p>Favorite Thing I Ate While Watching</p>\n<p>I enjoyed a lovely halftime hot dog while checking in on the Sox from the press box of Acrisure Stadium, where I was working my full-time job covering University of Pittsburgh football as they took on Tennessee. It was just what I needed to get me through a hectic four hours of football. I watched Rafael Devers launch a first-inning grand slam during the stoppages of a pretty wild college football game unfolding in front of me. </p>\n  \n        \n      Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh about an hour and a half before kickoff between the Pitt Panthers and Tennessee Volunteers. \n  \n<p>Looking Forward</p>\n<p>After an off-day on Monday, the Red Sox are at home for their next five — two against the Yankees and three against Kansas City. </p>\n<p>This Week in Red Sox History</p>\n<p>On September 7, 1923, Howard Ehmke threw the 11th no-hitter in Red Sox history as they beat the Philadelphia Athletics 4-0 at Shibe Park in Philly. Ehmke went the distance while striking out just one and allowing a single walk that separated him from a perfect game. He added two hits in four at-bats to really round out his afternoon. Right fielder Ira Flagstead’s three hits and two walks sparked the offense, who took advantage of five walks surrendered by A’s starter Slim Hariss. </p>\n<p>The Red Sox finished that year 61-91 and in eighth place in the American League so this was a pretty nice distraction from how bad they were that year. That win broke up a streak of four straight losses. </p>\n  \n        \n      Howard Ehmke, seen here displaying the fine dental hygiene the 1920s were known for.",

After taking the weekend series from the Baltimore Orioles, the Red Sox sit just 4.5  games back of fourth place in the AL East and three games under .500. Boston travels back to Fenway Park today and begins a three game set with the New York Yankees on Tuesday. Operation Help Tampa Bay is in full effect with the Rays 5.5 game back of the AL East lead. Sadly Tampa didn’t help themselves much over the weekend. But the dream is still alive! Talk about what you want and be good to one another.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Jose Andujar &amp; Luis Santana kick off our offseason series on every player to appear with the Astros system in 2022. </p> Throughout the 2022-23 offseason, Crawfish Boxes will be reviewing all 316 players to appear at any level for the team through the 2022 season.\n<p>In the lower echelons of the minor leagues, there is a notable dearth of metric information that we’ve become used to at the major league level. Take some of these things with a grain of salt. </p>\nJose Andujar\n<p>In part one of our series, we’re taking a look at 20-year-old right-handed pitcher Jose Andujar. Born on February 10, 2002, the Azua, DR native struck out 42 in 30 2⁄3 innings for the DSL Astros in 2021, starting in seven of his 13 appearances and going 4-5 with a 5.28 ERA. His solid strikeout numbers came with a wildness caveat, with 27 walks for that year. </p>\n<p>A lateral promotion would see Andujar start the 2022 season with the FCL Astros Orange squad. Wildness remains a concern to his game, with 35 (vs 37 strikeouts) in only 28 innings. Andujar posted an 0-2 record for the Orange team, with a 6.75 ERA. So far through his professional career, he’s managed a 1.824 WHIP, something he’ll need to get under control in order to progress past the rookie level in 2023. </p>\n<p>On the positive side of things, hitters and runners have a hard time getting a read on Andujar as well. He limited opponents to a .202 batting average and allowed only five of nine would-be base stealers to successfully take a free base in 2022. In his best showing of the season, on June 16, Andujar struck out two and surrendered one walk over three hitless innings, earning his first save in a 9-2 win against the FCL Marlins. </p>\n<p>In the event that Andujar figures out his control problems, and considering a more-or-less average rate of development, his arrival in the majors would be around 2027. </p>\nLuis Santana\n<p>Luis Santana is a five-foot-nine infielder from Bani, DR. Born on July 20, 1999, he signed his first professional deal with the New York Mets in 2016. He spent three seasons in their system, and joined the Astros system on January 6, 2019 via trade. To wit, he came over with Ross Adolph and Scott Manea for Cody Bohanek and J.D. Davis.  </p>\n<p>In 2019, Santana’s first season in Houston’s organization, he split his time between the Low-A Tri-City ValleyCats and the Double-A Corpus Christi Hooks. Through 70 games in total, he slashed .257/.337/.329 with two homers and 17 RBI. He stole four bases, walked 20 times, and struck out 33 times in 252 plate appearances. </p>\n<p>After taking off the 2020 season (along with the rest of minor league baseball), Santana played 49 games for the High-A Asheville Tourists in 2021 and hit .229 while manning second and third base. He again only hit two home runs, but one of them went viral:</p>\n\n\n<p>this unbelievable bat flip from Astros prospect Luis Santana (acquired from the Mets in the JD Davis trade) already has nearly 500K views but it'd be well over a million if it was shot in landscapepic.twitter.com/aUL2t3hymW</p>— Céspedes Family BBQ (@CespedesBBQ) May 7, 2021\n\n\n\n<p>The 2022 season would see Santana appear in 90 contests, although he remained at the High-A level for the Tourists. He improved his slash line to .294/.386/.457, slamming nine homers with 49 RBI and 11 stolen bases. </p>\n<p>The month of June, in particular, was a good one for Santana, resulting in his selection was the South Atlantic League Player of the Month. According to Asheville.com:</p>\n<p>Luis tallied at least one hit in 19 of the 21 games he played in during the month of June and recorded ten multi-hit games. Santana capped the month off with a 5-for-6 performance against Bowling Green to become the first Tourists player in 2022 to deliver a five-hit game.</p>\n<p>Defensively, Santana played 230 1⁄3 innings at first (.995), 196 1⁄3 innings at second (.989), 158 1⁄3 innings at third (.936), 78 innings in right field (.889), and 9 1/3 innings in left (.800). </p>\n<p>Also of note, Santana has been called on to pitch on three separate occasions for Asheville this season, allowing one hit and striking one batter out over three innings. He issued one walk, and has put 20-of-38 pitches over the plate. </p>\n<p>Despite his recent progress, Santana has been a minor leaguer since 2016. If the Astros are appreciative of his growth, and he continues to progress over the next two seasons, Santana could make it to the majors likely sometime in 2025. </p>\n<p>So what do you think? Let me know in the comments if you’re on board for this magnificent endeavor. Let me know if you’re not on board, too, but imma write them all anyway. Thanks for reading. </p>",

        "description": "<p>What happens on the battlefield is rarely the thing that decides a war. Normally, the preparations beforehand determine what happens when the fighting begins—and these preparations are what settle the outcome of the war itself. This truth is playing out along the roads and in the towns of Kharkiv Oblast, the province that includes Ukraine’s second-largest city. The stunningly swift advance of Ukrainian forces, which started around September 1 and sped up soon after, has easily been the most dramatic—and for Ukraine and its supporters, the most uplifting—episode of the war since the current Russian invasion began on February 24. In a few days the Ukrainians liberated about as much territory as Russia had captured in a few months, while causing the disintegration of Russian forces around Izium, Kupyansk, and other logistically vital cities. From the outside, Ukraine appears to have changed the whole complexion of the war.</p><p>This stunning Ukrainian advance was anything but sudden. It resulted from a patient military buildup, excellent operational security, and, maybe most important, the diversion of some of the Russian army’s most powerful units from Kharkiv Oblast itself. The overall planning by the Ukrainian government and armed forces worked well on so many levels that it produced one of the greatest military-strategy successes since 1945.</p><p>[Anne Applebaum: It’s time to prepare for a Ukrainian victory]</p><p>Only a week ago, the most important engagement for Ukraine appeared to be the battle for Kherson. For months, President Volodymyr Zelensky, his senior aides, and other Ukrainian sources had publicly proclaimed the goal of liberating the politically and strategically important southern city and the rest of the Russian-controlled territory on the west bank of the Dnipro River. Not only did the Ukrainians discuss the upcoming campaign, but they took all the necessary preparatory steps. They used their most effective long-range weaponry, including the American-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, to destroy bridges, ammunition depots, and other targets up and down the Russian lines near Kherson. These logistical attacks suggested that the Ukrainians would focus on this area for the rest of the summer.</p><p>In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin—who seemed to agree that the city was the highest priority—did exactly what the Ukrainians hoped: He rushed forces to the area. Evidence exists that some well-armed Russian units were redeployed there from the Russian-occupied Donbas in the east.</p><p>By some criteria, Kherson was a much better place than the Donbas or Kharkiv Oblast for the Ukrainians to engage the Russians. The southern city is deeper into Ukraine and farther from the sources of Russian supplies. Supply lines into Kherson depend on only a few crossings over the Dnipro. Ukrainian strategists who want to keep wearing down the Russian army would rather see its most powerful parts in Kherson than the Donbas, which is much easier for Russia to protect by air.</p><p>On August 29, the Ukrainians stepped up their attacks around Kherson. Though they made some incremental advances at first, the battle seemed to be only a somewhat accelerated version of the attritional warfare that has been under way since April. Stories started circulating that the Ukrainians were being cautious in their plans and that U.S. officials had dissuaded them from bolder maneuvers.</p><p>[Phillips Payson O’Brien: Ukraine is waging a new kind of war]</p><p>Ukraine’s restraint in Kherson now looks like a tactical decision. As Ukrainian Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov admitted Saturday, Ukraine’s generals had been planning to launch two campaigns simultaneously. If the Kherson offensive was designed to grind down Russian forces by drawing them in and then confronting them head-on, the Kharkiv Oblast offensive had greater territorial ambitions. Ukraine hoped to retake the city of Kupyansk. The Russians were using this road-and-rail hub to get supplies to Izium, a base for their operations in the Donbas.</p><p>In retrospect, both offensives were possible only because of a ghastly summer of attritional warfare in that region. Since April the Ukrainians have suffered horrifying losses in that region but have inflicted even larger ones on the enemy. So the Russian army has been trying to hold a large and geographically unwieldy slice of Ukraine even as its own numbers decline. Ukraine, which has been conscripting soldiers since Putin started this war, has amassed an army larger than the Russian invasion force. Russian officials, meanwhile, are terrified of upsetting their populace and have avoided conscription—to the point of deploying mercenaries and sourcing soldiers from prisons and mental hospitals. So when Putin took the Ukrainians’ bait in Kherson, a shrinking Russian army moved forces away from the area that Ukraine wanted to attack and toward an area where Ukraine was waging a war of attrition.</p><p>[George Packer: Ukrainians are defending the values that Americans claim to hold]</p><p>The Ukrainians wrote a script, and the Russians played their assigned role. Unlike Kherson, where the invaders had massed forces and set up a multilayered defense, Kharkiv Oblast was thinly protected by the Russian forces. The Ukrainians were thus easily able to break Russian lines, which seem to have been held by poorly motivated and trained forces, and streak deep behind them. To give their forces the best chance to succeed, the Ukrainians also seem to have built up a substantial, fast-moving strike force. Without allowing details of their preparations to leak out—Ukrainian sources have disclosed little if any information valuable to Russia—they seem to have constructed a number of specialized combat brigades with lighter, faster wheeled vehicles. This has allowed them a crucial mobility advantage over their enemy.</p><p>Though the war is far from over and Russia can find new ways to punish Ukraine, collapsing Russian forces have not only been pushed back; in abandoning their former headquarters in Izium, they also left behind large stores of equipment and ammunition that the Ukrainians can now use against them. Even if the Russians stabilize the line in the coming days, they will be in a far worse position than they were on September 1. Building on months of careful efforts to both prepare Ukrainian forces and waste Russian ones, Ukraine has achieved a strategic masterstroke that military scholars will study for decades to come.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Forget dragons. Forget sinister, squelchy alternate dimensions. Forget fugue-state globe hopping and ethereal elven world building. The maximalist, budget-busting trend in television is aesthetically overwhelming and virtually unavoidable right now. Still, the most fascinating shows of 2022 thus far aren’t the ones reconstructing Edith Wharton’s New York brick by pixelated brick or staging cinematic missions to Mars. They’re much smaller in scope and tighter in frame. They feel unmistakably confined.</p><p>The Patient, a new FX drama from the creators of The Americans, takes place predominantly in a cozy ’70s-style basement, where a character played by Steve Carell has been shackled around his ankle. The Bear, another FX show and the surprise breakout of the year, is centered on a claustrophobic restaurant kitchen in Chicago. Severance, Apple TV+’s genially strange series about corporate capitalism run amok, features employees who are essentially trapped in the office. On Showtime’s Yellowjackets, horrors ensue when an all-girls soccer team gets stranded in the wilderness. In HBO Max’s Somebody Somewhere, a comedian feels gloomily oppressed by her return to her small Kansas hometown. On Season 2 of Hacks, a diva-esque comedian and her assistant spend far too much time together on a cramped tour bus.</p><p>[Read: The powerful, unlikely force shaping modern TV]</p><p>The idea of confinement has always offered generative territory for writers: There’s almost no better setup for dramatic tension than two people cooped up together in a place they’d both rather not be. The Patient, which creators Joel Fields and Joe Weisberg have noted could’ve easily been a play, toys with black humor and fluctuations in power between its two primary characters in a way that evokes Samuel Beckett. But the theme also brings to mind television’s tradition of bottle episodes, dialogue-driven installments set in a single existing location (traditionally to save money, but more recently to court a certain kind of prestige). Captivity is where characters, and writers, come out to play.</p><p>The Patient, whose fourth of 10 episodes airs this week, draws on the familiarity of its setting—wood paneling, beige carpet, board games stacked up on a shelf—to make a backdrop so banal that the psychological contours of its characters can’t help but stand out. In the first episode, a therapist named Dr. Alan Strauss (Carell) wakes foggily in a bed with pastel sheets and a floral quilted comforter—with a 10-foot metal chain attached to his ankle. The concept is as sinister as a Saw movie’s, without the flamboyantly evil theatrics. Alan’s captor turns out to be one of his patients, Sam (Domhnall Gleeson), who’s brought his therapist home for a prolonged session in the hope that Strauss can rid him of his compulsion to kill people.</p><p>What I find most fascinating about the first episode of The Patient, which wraps up in a spry 21 minutes, is how immediately it contorts the dynamics of the doctor-patient relationship. A flashback shows Sam, under the guise of “Gene,” first visiting Alan in his home office. The room is House &amp; Garden–elegant; Alan reclines in a mid-century chair and gazes at Sam, who sits, stiff and uncomfortable, on the edge of the leather couch. The power in the scene clearly belongs to Alan—he has the gentle but implacable authority of the expensive medical professional. But his detention in Sam’s basement disrupts the terms of their relationship. Suddenly, Sam has all the power. Alan’s effort to excavate his patient’s psyche is now freighted with the extra weight of having to appease his captor. By contrast, Sam seems lighter. “I couldn’t really tell you the truth in your office,” he says. “But here, I can.”</p><p>Having seen all 10 episodes of The Patient, I’m not convinced that it wouldn’t have worked better as a play or a movie. Midway through, the show’s taut reliance on its own concept starts to falter, and the further it gets from Sam’s basement, the saggier things become. But the interplay between the duo early on is electric, and unnervingly funny at times. Sam might be a serial killer, but he’s also a foodie. A restaurant inspector by day, he brings sweating sacks of high-end takeout to Alan at night. “Good luck not eating this,” he says smugly in the second episode, bearing pork buns. Later, Sam pronounces pho as “fer” so emphatically, it’s almost a microaggression. Carell, uncharacteristically muted and subtle as the phlegmatic, be-cardiganed Alan, remains mostly calm in his captor’s presence, but you’re reminded in occasional flashes that he’s also playing the specific role he thinks Sam wants him to play. There are roiling currents beneath the surface.</p><p>Tension is expressed more obviously in The Bear, Christopher Storer’s eight-episode dramedy about an extraordinary chef who returns home to Chicago to try to salvage his late brother’s Italian-beef-sandwich shop. The sense of entrapment in the show is literal and emotional. Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) is encumbered by his failure to see how his brother, who died by suicide, was suffering; his mission to save The Original Beef, you sense, is as much about making himself miserable as penance as it is about preserving something special. But much of The Bear also takes place in the confines of the scorching kitchen, where chefs manhandle and crowd one another (Behind! Corner!) and grate one another’s nerves like aged pecorino. The seventh episode is filmed largely in one long take, trapping the viewer alongside Carmy in a nightmare shift of chaos and dysfunction.</p><p>[Read: TV’s best new show is a study of masculinity in crisis]</p><p>HBO’s gorgeous, understated Somebody Somewhere, which debuted in January, stars the comedian Bridget Everett as Sam. She’s strikingly similar to Carmy: grieving a sibling, reluctantly back in her hometown after years away (the series is set in Manhattan, Kansas, but was filmed mostly around Chicago), and deliberately stifling a talent that can’t help but sneak its way out. As in The Bear and The Patient, abundant flashbacks surface as memories. Carmy has panic attacks triggered by his hazing in elite kitchens; Alan thinks about his late wife and the family’s rift with his son, who converted to ultra-Orthodox Judaism to their chagrin. Sam remembers her sister, whose care made her feel necessary and whose absence has left her untethered.</p><p>The function of memory is pivotal in narratives about confinement. In Beckett’s plays, characters who are trapped in purgatorial spaces, or within the frail physicality of their own aging bodies, find (limited) release through the things they can remember. On Severance, a show that imagines the bifurcation of the brain into two selves—a work-based “Innie” and an exterior “Outie”—the “Innie” characters, who never leave the office, are denied this solace. They have no memories of the outside world; they have a void where their knowledge of themselves should be. For Mark (Adam Scott), who’s mired in grief following the death of his wife, the absence of memory brings powerful, if unhealthy, relief. For Helly (Britt Lower), the annihilation of self, and the inability to exist beyond work, is a traumatic shock so sharp that she tries to end her own life.</p><p>All of which brings me to a question: Why are so many shows circling the idea of restraint, the burden and immurement of caring for others, the slight insanity of feeling all your options ebb away? “Is The Patient a full-blown allegory for the pandemic, or is it just me?” Mary McNamara asked in the Los Angeles Times last week, a question I’d also been mulling. I’m not sure—the show itself is so steeped in ideas of fathers and sons, of Jewishness, of history and the recesses of the human psyche, that it defies simple characterization. But there does seem to be a vibe in the ether speaking to things that many people have been feeling over the past two-plus years: a figurative sense of walls closing in, of being rooted against our will in one particular place. Even the preoccupation with food feels familiar.</p><p>There’s also a different kind of entrapment playing out on television that seems to refer less to being cut off from the world than to the idea that fate can be its own kind of imprisonment. So many of today’s most compelling TV characters feel cursed by both circumstance and their own nature. Think Elizabeth Holmes, summoning a darker, hyperreal version of herself in front of a mirror in The Dropout; Barry Berkman, veering between wide-eyed naif and fixed-gaze psychopath in Barry; Saul Goodman, conjuring charisma from the depths of Hades to face the music in Better Call Saul’s finale. If these characters haven’t exactly been shut off or penned in, they have, you could argue, been on rigid narrative tracks from the beginning. In a moment that feels existentially chaotic, there’s something satisfying about the dramatic tradition of forcing characters to confront their destiny.</p><p>Still, I’m grateful for this spate of shows for illustrating what boundless storytelling potential can be found by setting limits. When so much attention-grabbing television seems intent on doing as much as possible as extravagantly as it can, there’s something energizing about works that embrace other ways of operating. In their Dogme 95 manifesto, the directors Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg drew up a list of rules they wanted to apply to their work in pursuit of artistic integrity. The “supreme goal,” the document states, is “to force the truth out of my characters and settings.” Confinement, as we’re seeing now, can be unexpectedly fruitful—and even liberating.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Chrome is preparing to add hover cards to extensions that are pinned to your browser tool bar. These hover cards will let you know what types of permissions this extension requests and which permissions it has been granted for the URL you are currently in. Additionally, there will be a hover button beside it asking whether to grant permissions to any other installed extensions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For comparison, below we’re including a screenshot of how the browser tool bar looks now and the tooltip that appears when you hover on the icon of a pinned extension. Below that is an animated GIF of what is currently available in Chrome Canary. As you can see, the tooltip has been replaced with a hover card. This new feature was spotted and reported on by u/Leopeva64-2 on Reddit, who constantly tracks these changes and shares them with the community.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>However, the question that remains, at least for me, is what the usefulness of such a feature is. Sure, it will probably save you a click or two to investigate if a questionable browser extension has permissions over something it shouldn’t, but is that really worth sacrificing so much toolbar space? I am of the opinion that it’s getting pretty crowded up there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a feature that for now only appears in Canary, I’m hoping that if the plan is to bring this all the way to the Stable version, it gets significantly refined to the point where the hover card is not so large and prominent. Let us know in the comments if you think this is a necessary feature, or if you think that the Chrome toolbar is getting too busy. </p>\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3638679-hard-questions-for-king-charles-iii/",
        "description": "<p>As the reality of Queen Elizabeth II’s passing sinks in, and international mourning continues, Britain’s unmatched flair for dignified pageantry is affirming the continuity and stability of the nation and its sovereignty. Notwithstanding the ceremony, however, no one is blind to the hard questions King Charles III and the monarchy itself will face in short order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inevitably after 70 years of one person’s reign, Charles will face close scrutiny to see if he matches the expectations, accumulating for decades, about the sovereign’s behavior. Equally inevitably, beginning perhaps during the preparations for Charles’s coronation (likely next year), there will be a surge of republican sentiment from Britain’s left advocating elimination of the monarchy itself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accordingly, how the new king comports himself in the coming months could be decisive not merely on some “performance” level but, constitutionally, in handling both near and long-term challenges he and Britain face. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the origins of the United States lie in repudiating the monarchy, many here too readily dismiss its deep-rooted significance for our United Kingdom cousins. Given our (history’s oldest, continuously-in-force, written) Constitution, Britain’s historically derived, unwritten and now almost unique form of constitutional order is even more remote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unquestionably, however, the evolution of Great Britain’s governance structures over centuries has produced a monarchy that is not simply a decoration, an appendage that can be easily excised with few collateral consequences. Even so, early missteps by Charles will complicate his reign; full-blown debate over abolishing the monarchy can only complicate it more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doubts about the monarchy’s utility underlie much of the coverage of the ongoing royal transition. Some commentators stress the turmoil, stress and uncertainty Britain faces, led by both a new sovereign and a new prime minister, but such assessments are overwrought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are not in World War II. That was stress. Other pundits have excoriated Britain’s imperial past, as if the monarchy alone is responsible for the alleged misdeeds. It is not, nor is it responsible for the enormous benefits stemming from Britain’s empire-building, “mother of parliaments” that it is, not that many today will mount that defense.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Properly analyzing the monarchy requires assessing its unique function in the UK’s constitutional system, not every aspect of British international policy. Nonetheless, as the living symbol of Britain’s nationhood, the new king will face many more broadside attacks.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first days defining his new role, under unprecedented media attention, Charles has delivered in unexpected ways. Arriving at Buckingham Palace, his new home, rather than just inspecting the flowers and mementoes left to honor the queen, he greeted well-wishers gathered across the palace’s frontage, an image that surely stunned and likely captivated Britons who rarely see such a personal royal touch or public access. Even while mourning his loss, Charles reached out to the British people, and they responded. It was a masterstroke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Immediately thereafter, the king’s first speech was entirely on target constitutionally.  Duty, service and constancy are obviously Charles’s priorities, as they were Elizabeth’s.  Still, this is just the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paramount question is whether Charles can maintain his mother’s distance from day-to-day politics. In these first remarks, he signaled a withdrawal from the political arena: \"It will no longer be possible for me to give so much of my time and energies to the charities and issues for which I care so deeply. But I know this important work will go on in the trusted hands of others.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Britain’s constitutional system, the king’s duty – and it is a duty of constitutional dimensions, not mere symbolism – is to be the nation’s voice when necessary. His role decidedly does not involve nattering on about current events. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At moments of grave crisis, such as wartime, the king can exercise a steadying presence, and provide a much-needed sounding board for the prime minister, a presence who should have no agenda other than discerning the national interest and how best to protect it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As crown prince, Charles was outspoken on issues such as the environment and climate change, obviously popular for many, but complicated and politically controversial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A king’s proper stance, by contrast, requires remaining above the specifics of legislative or policy programs at Westminster or 10 Downing Street. He is not a political actor or commentator. Resisting the allure of short-term political acclaim must be a top royal priority, a task requiring sustained effort and discipline to succeed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, Charles III’s military experience, in both the (appropriately named) Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, marks potentially the most important constitutional role he can play. Although the King’s authority as commander in chief is fully delegated to parliamentary ministers, national defense is existential, and the monarch embodies British nationhood not just sentimentally, but constitutionally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, King George VI’s determination to stay in Britain during World War II no matter what, in the face of a feared Nazi invasion and after Buckingham Palace itself had been bombed, compellingly demonstrated the will to survive as a nation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On another practical level, the king’s constitutional persona as head of the Commonwealth of Nations is potentially quite significant. There are untapped possibilities for the United Kingdom and the West more broadly in the Commonwealth, and Charles’s long international experience provides a foundation for prime ministers to build upon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the Commonwealth, the king could play a significant role representing British national security policies generally. For example, an early visit by the new king to Ukraine would carry enormous weight. Newly liberated from the European Union, global Britain could make full use of the monarchy, probably its best-known national institution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other perils clearly ahead for Charles. Media and critics will scrutinize all things financial and the inevitable efforts of many to take advantage of his new role.  Although he has already endured such a spotlight, the new extent of the attention will be extraordinary. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elizabeth was spared much of this pressure, but Charles will have no such luxury.  Success in the monarchy is ultimately a test of character, and therefore will rest only on the king himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John Bolton was national security adviser to President Trump from 2018 to 2019, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 2005 to 2006 and held senior State Department posts in 2001-2005 and 1985-1989. His most recent book is “The Room Where It Happened” (2020). He is the founder of John Bolton Super PAC, a political action committee supporting candidates who believe in a strong U.S. foreign policy.</p>",

Twenty-two percent said they weren’t sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The finding comes as the Supreme Court’s approval rating hovers near record low levels in the wake of controversial decisions on abortion and other issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A July Gallup poll found a growing partisan gap in the court’s approval, with 13 percent of Democrats approving of the court’s job, the lowest level yet. Seventy-four percent of Republicans, meanwhile, approved of the Supreme Court’s job, a large jump from the 45 percent recorded last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That poll was taken in the weeks after the court finished its annual term, during which it released multiple controversial decisions. In its perhaps most high-profile move, the court struck down Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to abortion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Axios-Ipsos poll also found that 38 percent of respondents agreed that the government should comply with the interests of the majority, even if it comes at the expense of ethnic and religious minority groups’ civil rights. Forty-one percent disagreed with the statement, while 21 percent were unsure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A slight majority — 51 percent — disagreed that the government should be empowered to prosecute members of the news media who make offensive or unpatriotic statements. Thirty-three percent agreed with prosecuting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The poll was conducted Sept. 1-2 with a sample of 1,001 U.S. adults. The margin of error is 3.8 percentage points.</p>",

        "description": "Kamil Krzaczynski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>The Mets will look to keep their hold on first place in the NL East.</p> <p>The Mets (89-52) are back at Citi Field to begin a seven-game homestand with three against the Cubs (58-82). The Mets took three of four when they visited Wrigley Field back in July.</p>\n<p>The Mets took two out of three from the Marlins down at loanDepot Park over the weekend. weren’t able to contain the offensively-challenged Marlins on Friday, resulting in a 6-3 loss. David Peterson was ineffective and only lasted 4 2⁄3 innings, while New York’s offense floundered against Edward Cabrera, though Pete Alonso did bust out of his slump with a two-run homer. The Mets blew two bases loaded opportunities with double plays, but they were still within one run heading into the eighth. That was when Joely Rodriguez imploded, giving up a couple of runs and putting the game out of reach.</p>\n<p>The Mets bounced back with a rout on Saturday, smoking the Marlins 11-3. They used an eight-run fourth inning to do most of the damage, with Mark Canha’s grand slam serving as the big blast. Francisco Lindor and Eduardo Escobar also went deep in this game, which was a much-needed laugher for New York. Carlos Carrasco was also strong, tossing six innings of one-run ball.</p>\n<p>The Mets followed up their strong Saturday showing with another easy victory, taking the Sunday rubber match 9-3. Brandon Nimmo was the offensive star, contributing a three-run blast that put the Mets up early in this one. Later in the game, Nimmo even stole his first base of the season. Escobar, meanwhile, hit his second home run in as many days as he continues his torrid pace. Tomás Nido, in his 243rd at-bat of the year, hit his first homer. Mark Vientos made his major league debut, going 0 for 5 in this contest as he replaced the injured Starling Marte on the roster. Taijuan Walker rebounded nicely from a subpar outing, and showed no ill effects from the blister he battled in that outing.</p>\n<p>With yesterday’s win, coupled with the Braves’ dramatic walk-off loss to the Mariners, the Mets extended their lead in the National League East to 1.5 games after falling briefly out of first for one night. The Mets, who are two up in the loss column on Atlanta, have 21 games remaining, while the Braves have 22. The Mets will play two of the weaker NL Central teams coming up, while the Braves visit San Francisco before returning home to face the Phillies, who have a lot to play for down the stretch as they look to secure one of the three Wild Card spots. In addition to the division, the Mets lowered their magic number to clinch their first playoff spot since 2016 down to eight games, meaning any combination of eight Mets wins or Brewers losses will secure New York a trip to the postseason. Lastly, the team’s next win will give them their 12th 90-win season in their 60-year history.</p>\n<p>Escobar, who extended his hitting streak to nine games in yesterday’s win, has been raging hot as of late. Over those nine games, he’s slashing .500/.541/1.000 while leading the team with five homers, eight runs scored, nine runs batted in, a 316 wRC+, and a 1.1 fWAR. Nimmo has also come alive this month, hitting .282/.378/564 with two home runs, seven runs scored, nine runs batted in, a 165 wRC+, and a 0.6 fWAR in 10 September games. Jeff McNeil, who continues to threaten for the NL batting crown, has posted a .361/.395/.417 with a 130 wRC+ and a 0.4 fWAR in 10 games this month.</p>\n<p>The Cubs dropped two of three to the Giants over the weekend. The Cubs have dropped six of their nine games in September.</p>\n<p>The Mets will not see Willson Contreras, the catcher whom they were eyeing at the deadline. He suffered a left ankle sprain about a week ago and landed on the IL as a result. Prior to that, he was hitting .246/.351/.471 with 21 home runs while leading the club with a 131 wRC+ in his 107 games this season.</p>\nMonday, September 12: Chris Bassitt vs. Javier Assad, 7:10 p.m. on SNY\n<p>Bassitt (2022): 161.1 IP, 153 K, 41 BB, 15 HR, 3.24 ERA, 3.40 FIP, 1.13 WHIP, 3.4 bWAR</p>\n<p>When the Mets needed him most, Bassitt came up huge. Coming off four losses in seven games to subpar teams, the right-hander tossed a gem, allowing one earned run over 7.0 innings. He also struck out 10, which was his second-highest total in a single game this year. Bassitt, quietly, has been a consistent force for this rotation this year and has helped stabilize it, as Sports Illustrated’s Rob Piersall discussed earlier this week. If he can keep pitching like that, the Mets will like their chances of winning the NL East and going deep in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Assad (2022): 15.1 IP, 12 K, 7 BB, 2 HR, 2.93 ERA, 4.62 FIP, 1.44 WHIP, 0.5 bWAR</p>\n<p>After signing with Chicago as an international free agent in 2015, Assad made his debut this year for the Cubs. After tossing nine shutout innings over his first two starts against the  Cardinals and the Blue Jays, the right-hander allowed one run in a one inning relief outing, and then had his worst start his last time out against the Reds. In that start, he went 5 1⁄3 innings and allowed four earned runs on five hits with six strikeouts.</p>\nTuesday, September 13: Jacob deGrom vs. Adrian Sampson, 7:10 p.m. on SNY\n<p>deGrom (2022): 43.1 IP, 63 K, 4 BB, 3 HR, 1.66 ERA, 1.39 FIP, 0.55 WHIP, 1.9 bWAR</p>\n<p>deGrom was far from at his best his last time out. So what was his final line in a less-than-elite deGrom appearance. Seven shutout innings, three hits, one walk, eight strikeouts. That’s how good he is. He can take the mound without his best stuff and he can still dominate. He has now throwing 90+ pitches in three out of four starts—he tossed 87 pitches in the other—and should, theoretically, be good to go for as many pitches as he’s needed for, though the team will likely continue to be cautious with their prized right-hander.</p>\n<p>Sampson (2022): 76.2 IP, 55 K, 19 BB, 8 HR, 3.76 ERA, 3.82 FIP, 1.29 WHIP, 1.2 bWAR</p>\n<p>Sampson is having one of the better years of his career as he has had a renaissance after arriving in Chicago last year. He is coming off perhaps his strongest showing of the year, as he allowed just one earned run on five hits against Cincinnati. He limited the Reds to five hits and did not walk anybody, though he only struck out one. It wasn’t good enough, however, as Chicago settled for a loss while the right-hander got a no decision. Sampson faced the Mets earlier this year at Wrigley, allowing two earned runs on six hits, with three walks and one strikeout over 5 1⁄3 innings.</p>\nWednesday, September 14: TBD vs. Drew Smyly, 7:10 p.m. on SNY\n<p>TBD</p>\n<p>The Mets have not announced a starter for Wednesday’s game against the Cubs. It will likely be David Peterson in place of the injured Max Scherzer, who threw a bullpen yesterday as he works his way back. In his last outing against Miami, Peterson went 3 2⁄3 innings and allowed three earned runs on five hits with seven strikeouts. The Mets could also go to Trevor Williams for this start. Scherzer will be eligible to come off the IL for his next start, which would be September 19.</p>\n<p>Smyly (2022): 98.1 IP, 84 K, 25 BB, 15 HR, 3.57 ERA, 4.31 FIP, 1.20 WHIP, 1.9 bWAR</p>\n<p>Smyly is pitching for the seventh team in his nine-year career, and the fifth team over the past four years. And yet, the left-hander continues to do well regardless of the surroundings. He is coming off a tremendous showing against San Francisco, holding the Giants to one unearned run on one hit, with two walks and eight strikeouts over 7.0 innings. He faced the Mets earlier this year, going 4 1⁄3 innings and allowing two runs (one earned) on five hits, with one walk and four strikeouts. He has typically handled the Mets well in his career, pitching to a 1.89 ERA with 20 strikeouts in 19.0 innings.</p>\n<p>Prediction: The Mets take two out of three from the Cubs.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Sep. 13: The Rays announced that Criswell has been returned to Triple-A. Additionally, they have recalled Josh Fleming and Yonny Chirinos, with the latter serving as the “29th man” for today’s doubleheader.</p>\n<p>Sep. 12, 1:05pm: Topkin relays that McKay has indeed been transferred to the 60-day IL to open up another 40-man roster spot. The Rays also announced the moves, saying that Criswell has been “added” to the roster, with Guerra and Herget “selected.” That would seem to suggest that Criswell is a COVID substitute, temporarily taking Raley’s place on the roster. That means he will be eligible to be removed from the roster at a later date without being placed on waivers.</p>\n<p>9:05am: The Rays are making a series of changes to their pitching staff prior to a big five-game series in Toronto that starts tonight (Twitter links from Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times). Three right-handers will be added to the roster: Cooper Criswell, Kevin Herget and Javy Guerra. Two other righties, Luis Patiño and Calvin Faucher, were optioned after yesterday’s game to open a couple of spots on the active roster. Left-hander Brooks Raley will open a third by being placed on the restricted list, ineligible to cross the Canadian-American border due to his unvaccinated status. None of Criswell, Herget or Guerra are on the 40-man roster, which is currently at 39. Raley won’t count against that number while on the restricted list, leaving the club still to open one spot. Speculatively speaking, they could transfer lefty Brendan McKay to the 60-day injusted list in the wake of the news of his Tommy John surgery.</p>\n<p>Criswell, 26, made his MLB debut last year with a 1 1/3-inning cup of coffee with the Angels. They placed him on the 60-day IL this year due to shoulder soreness and eventually lost him to the Rays on a waiver claim in July. Since that claim, Criswell has thrown 27 1/3 innings over eight games for the Triple-A Durham Bulls. He has a 3.95 ERA in that time with a 20.8% strikeout rate, 4.7% walk rate and 51.9% ground ball rate. He was designated for assignment in July, getting outrighted after clearing waivers. He will get the start for tonight’s game and could give the Rays at least a few frames. Each of his last eight appearances have been between three and four innings.</p>\n<p>Herget, 31, spent many years in the Cardinals’ system and one in Cleveland’s before joining the Rays on a minor league deal. He was selected to Tampa’s roster in August but got designated for assignment before making his MLB debut. He’s thrown 91 2/3 innings over 19 appearances for the Bulls on the year, making him another multi-inning option for the Rays. He has a 2.55 ERA for the season with a 24.7% strikeout rate, 3.8% walk rate and 35.9% ground ball rate.</p>\n<p>Guerra, 26, has 34 innings of MLB experience thus far, mostly with the Padres. He was traded to the Rays in April for cash considerations but was designated for assignment in May, clearing waivers and getting outrighted to Durham. He briefly returned to the team as a COVID substitute the last time the Rays traveled to Toronto. He’s been used in the more traditional single-inning reliever role, having thrown 41 1/3 innings over 43 Triple-A games this year. He has a 1.74 ERA in that stretch with a 31.9% strikeout rate, 9.8% walk rate and 47.1% grounder rate.</p>\n<p>Thanks to tomorrow’s doubleheader, the Rays and Jays will be playing five games over the next four days, making it fairly logical for Tampa to add some fresh arms. Josh Fleming and Jimmy Yacabonis are also traveling with the team on the taxi squad, making them candidates to be the club’s “29th man” for the twin bill. Along with the Mariners, the Rays and Blue Jays are holding down the American League Wild Card spots, with all three teams within half a game of each other. That means these contests will be key in determining the postseason picture in a few weeks’ time. In this year’s new playoff format, the first round is played entirely in the home field of the top-seeded team, so there’s a meaningful difference between having the first Wild Card spot and the second/third.</p>",

That’s because Connor Wong, like Reese McGuire, is making a case that he’s a big league catcher. (Peter Abraham, Boston Globe)</p>\n<p>With the new rule changes officially being adopted by MLB last week, here’s a good break down about which Sox players will be affected the most. TL;DR: Matt Barnes is really going to have to pick up the pace. (Chadd Jennings, The Athletic)</p>\n<p>Matt Strahm  really doesn’t like the new rule changes, saying, amongst other things, that “[t]he one beautiful thing about baseball, to me, is there’s never been a clock in the game.” Look, I understand that change scares people. But if the one beautiful thing about baseball to you is that it doesn’t have a clock, then maybe you don’t like baseball as much as you think. Maybe you just really hate clocks. (Ryan Gilbert, WEEI)</p>\n<p>Portland’s David Hamilton wound down a huge year on the base paths by setting the Sea Dogs’ single season record with 65 stolen bases. If you’re just now hearing his name, his a nice background piece on him from spring training. (Christopher Smith, MassLive)</p>\n<p>The Sox released Hirokazu Sawamura yesterday. It’s a somewhat surprising move, considering that he’s probably better than a couple of arms currently sitting in the bullpen right now, but word on the Tweets is that he requested it. (Scott Neville, NESN)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

No doubt virtual and extended reality have a role to play in education. I've flown in a full-size virtual helocopter and performed VR neurosurgery and am convinced. But it's one thing to name yourself 'Multiverse' and quite another to deliver on what that word suggests.

M le ministre is to get poetic justice at the hands of a strange, reclusive man (Fred Blin) who is to receive his own retribution from the only character in the film with any courage and human spirit: teenager Louise (Lilith Grasmug), who is nervous about going all the way for the first time with her boyfriend.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p>When Emmanuel Obeng-Dankwa is worried about making rent on his New York City apartment, he sometimes holds off on filling his blood pressure medication.</p><p>“If there’s no money, I prefer to skip the medication to being homeless,” said Obeng-Dankwa, a 58-year-old security guard.</p><p>He is among a majority of adults in the U.S. who say that health care is not handled well in the country, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.</p><p>The poll reveals that public satisfaction with the U.S. health care system is remarkably low, with fewer than half of Americans saying it is generally handled well. Only 12 percent say it is handled extremely or very well. Americans have similar views about health care for older adults.</p><p>Overall, the public gives even lower marks for how prescription drug costs, the quality of care at nursing homes and mental health care are being handled, with just 6 percent or less saying those health services are done very well in the country.</p><p>“Navigating the American health care system is exceedingly frustrating,” said A. Mark Fendrick, the director of the University of Michigan Center for Value-Based Insurance Design. “The COVID pandemic has only made it worse.”</p><p>More than two years after the pandemic's start, health care worker burnout and staffing shortages are plaguing hospitals around the country. And Americans are still having trouble getting in-person medical care after health centers introduced restrictions as COVID-19 killed and sickened millions of people around the country, Fendrick said.</p><p>In fact, the poll shows an overwhelming majority of Americans, nearly 8 in 10, say they are at least moderately concerned about getting access to quality health care when they need it.</p><p>Black and Hispanic adults in particular are resoundingly worried about health care access, with nearly 6 in 10 saying they are very or extremely concerned about getting good care. Fewer than half of white adults, 44%, expressed the same level of worry.</p><p>Racial disparities have long troubled America's health care system. They have been abundantly clear during the COVID-19 pandemic, with Black and Hispanic people dying disproportionately from the virus. Black and Hispanic men also make up a disproportionately high rate of recent monkeypox infections.</p><p>Fifty-three percent of women said they are extremely or very concerned about obtaining quality care, compared to 42 percent of men.</p><p>While Americans are united in their dissatisfaction with the health care system, that agreement dissolves when it comes to solutions to fix it.</p><p>About two-thirds of adults think it is the federal government’s responsibility to make sure all Americans have health care coverage, with adults ages 18 to 49 more likely than those over 50 to hold that view. The percentage of people who believe health care coverage is a government responsibility has risen in recent years, ticking up from 57 percent in 2019 and 62 percent in 2017.</p><p>Still, there’s not consensus on how that coverage might be delivered.</p><p>About 4 in 10 Americans say they support a single-payer health care system that would require Americans to get their health insurance from a government plan. More, 58 percent, say they favor a government health insurance plan that anyone can purchase.</p><p>There also is broad support for policies that would help Americans pay for the costs of long-term care, including a government-administered insurance plan similar to Medicare, the federal government’s health insurance for people 65 or older.</p><p>Retired nurse Pennie Wright, of Camden, Tennessee, doesn’t like the idea of a government-run health care system.</p><p>After switching to Medicare this year, she was surprised to walk out of her annual well-woman visit, once fully covered by her private insurance plan, with $200 worth of charges for a mammogram and a pap smear.</p><p>She prefers the flexibility she had on her private insurance plan.</p><p>“I feel like we have the best health care system in the world, we have a choice of where we want to go,” Wright said.</p><p>A majority of Americans, roughly two-thirds, were happy to see the government step in to provide free COVID-19 testing, vaccines and treatment. Roughly 2 in 10 were neutral about the government’s response.</p><p>The government’s funding for free COVID-19 tests dried up at the beginning of the month. And while the White House says the latest batch of recommended COVID-19 boosters will be free to anyone who wants one, it doesn't have money on hand to buy any future rounds of booster shots for every American.</p><p>Eighty percent say they support the federal government negotiating for lower drug prices. President Joe Biden this summer signed a landmark bill into law allowing Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs. The move is expected to save taxpayers as much as $100 billion over the next decade.</p><p>“Medication costs should be low, to the minimum so that everyone can afford it,” said Obeng-Dankwa, the Bronx renter who has trouble paying for his medication. “Those who are poor should be able to get all the necessary health they need, in the same way someone who also has the money to pay for it.”</p>",

        "link": "https://realpython.com/inherit-python-list/",
        "description": "<p>At some point in your Python coding adventure, you may need to create custom list-like classes with modified behavior, new functionalities, or both. To do this in Python, you can inherit from an abstract base class, subclass the built-in list class directly, or inherit from UserList, which lives in the collections module.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:</p>\n\nCreate custom list-like classes by inheriting from the built-in list class\nBuild custom list-like classes by subclassing UserList from the collections module\n\n<p>You’ll also write some examples that’ll help you decide which parent class, list or UserList, to use when creating your custom list classes.</p>\n<p>To get the most out of this tutorial, you should be familiar with Python’s built-in list class and its standard features. You’ll also need to know the basics of object-oriented programming and understand how inheritance works in Python.</p>\n\n<p>Free Download: Click here to download the source code that you’ll use to create custom list-like classes.</p>\n\nCreating List-Like Classes in Python\n<p>The built-in list class is a fundamental data type in Python. Lists are useful in many situations and have tons of practical use cases. In some of these use cases, the standard functionality of Python list may be insufficient, and you may need to create custom list-like classes to address the problem at hand.</p>\n<p>You’ll typically find at least two reasons for creating custom list-like classes:</p>\n\nExtending the regular list by adding new functionality\nModifying the standard list’s functionality\n\n<p>You can also face situations in which you need to both extend and modify the list’s standard functionality.</p>\n<p>Depending on your specific needs and skill level, you can use a few strategies to create your own custom list-like classes. You can:</p>\n\nInherit from an appropriate abstract base class, such as MutableSequence\nInherit from the Python built-in list class directly\nSubclass UserList from collections\n\n\n<p>Note: In object-oriented programming, it’s common practice to use the verbs inherit and subclass interchangeably.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few considerations when you’re selecting the appropriate strategy to use. Keep reading for more details.</p>\nBuilding a List-Like Class From an Abstract Base Class\n<p>You can create your own list-like classes by inheriting from an appropriate abstract base class (ABC), like MutableSequence. This ABC provides generic implementations of most list methods except for .__getitem__(), .__setitem__(), .__delitem__, .__len__(), and .insert(). So, when inheriting from this class, you’ll have to implement these methods yourself.</p>\n<p>Writing your own implementation for all these special methods is a fair amount of work. It’s error-prone and requires advanced knowledge of Python and its data model. It can also imply performance issues because you’ll be writing the methods in pure Python.</p>\n<p>Additionally, suppose you need to customize the functionality of any other standard list method, like .append() or .insert(). In that case, you’ll have to override the default implementation and provide a suitable implementation that fulfills your needs.</p>\n<p>The main advantage of this strategy for creating list-like classes is that the parent ABC class will alert you if you miss any required methods in your custom implementation.</p>\n<p>In general, you should embrace this strategy only if you need a list-like class that’s fundamentally different from the built-in list class.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, you’ll focus on creating list-like classes by inheriting from the built-in list class and the UserList class from the standard-library collections module. These strategies seem to be the quickest and most practical ones.</p>\nInheriting From Python’s Built-in list Class\n<p>For a long time, it was impossible to inherit directly from Python types implemented in C. Python 2.2 fixed this issue. Now you can subclass built-in types, including list. This change has brought several technical advantages to the subclasses because now they:</p>\n\nWill work in every place that requires the original built-in type\nCan define new instance, static, and class methods\nCan store their instance attributes in a .__slots__ class attribute, which essentially replaces the .__dict__ attribute\n\nRead the full article at https://realpython.com/inherit-python-list/ »\n        \n        <p>[ Improve Your Python With 🐍 Python Tricks 💌 – Get a short &amp; sweet Python Trick delivered to your inbox every couple of days. &gt;&gt; Click here to learn more and see examples ]</p>",

Olivier (Olivier Saladin) and Laurence (Lorella Cravotta) are a conceited retired couple in deep denial about how much debt they’re in, but hoping to win big money by competing in a dance contest. They figure they are entitled to extra points for being older, and the ferocious opening scene shows the judges debating precisely this kind of liberal identity-politics issue. </p><p>The couple’s grown-up son, Alexandre (Alexandre Steiger), is a lawyer who, along with a bleary spin doctor (Denis Podalydès), is advising a creepy and reactionary government minister (Christophe Paou) who is keen to cut welfare while engaging in personal tax fraud and gives pompous interviews about family values while attending secret sex parties. M le ministre is to get poetic justice at the hands of a strange, reclusive man (Fred Blin) who is to receive his own retribution from the only character in the film with any courage and human spirit: teenager Louise (Lilith Grasmug), who is nervous about going all the way for the first time with her boyfriend.</p> Continue reading...",

Tanner’s cinema attempted to arouse “a smug nation drowsed by a facile ideology of neutrality” by looking at alternative lifestyles. </p><p>In 1968, Tanner and his friend Claude Goretta co-founded the Groupe 5 collective of Swiss film-makers. They proposed an idea to Swiss TV for the funding of full-length features to be shot in 16mm and then blown up to 35mm for release. This enabled Tanner to make his first feature film, Charles Mort ou Vif (Charles, Dead or Alive, 1969), which won first prize at the Locarno festival, and became the first Swiss film in more than two decades to be shown widely abroad.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Mills Fitzner\n    \n\n  <p>Malloy gave Mississippi an early jolt with a two run blast. </p> <p>The two lower levels of the Atlanta Braves minor league system wrapped up their regular seasons on Sunday, doing so in opposite fashion to each other. Augusta starter and 2022 draft pick Blake Burkhalter was phenomenal but the bullpen couldn’t hold an early lead. Meanwhile Rome finished on a high note with a win and will begin their first round playoff series with the Bowling Green Hot Rods on Tuesday. At the upper levels Gwinnett was rained out of their series finale while Justyn-Henry Malloy provided headlines with a home run. </p>\n(63-70) Gwinnett Stripers, (69-64) Buffalo Bisons  CANCELLED\n<p>Next Game: 9/13 vs (75-60) Durham Bulls @ 7:05 PM ET</p>\n(59-71) Mississippi Braves 4, (62-67) Biloxi Shuckers 5\n<p>Box Score</p>\n\nCade Bunnell, SS: 2-4, HR, .315/.438/.600\nJalen Miller, DH: 2-3, BB, .241/.347/.400\nJustyn-Henry Malloy, LF: 1-4, HR, 2 RBI, .291/.416/.459\nHayden Deal, SP:  1.1 IP, 3 H, 3 R, 3 ER, 2 BB, 1 K, 4.42 ERA\nIndigo Diaz, RP: 1 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K, 3.02 ERA\n\n<p>Mississippi put up a fight to come from behind late in this game, but ultimately dropped in extra innings and are officially eliminated from playoff contention. The Braves were able to take an early lead in this game behind the power of Justyn-Henry Malloy, who mashed a first inning two run home run. That was Malloy’s sixth home run in a Mississippi uniform and his 16th overall on the season. The offense was unfortunately a cold spot from their and the next hit wasn’t until the sixth inning when the Braves trailed 4-2. Jalen Miller and Cade Bunnell started a rally with one out singles and Riley Delgado brought the Braves within a run with a hit of his own. A wild pitch moved Bunnell and Delgado into scoring position with one out, but after a strikeout Bunnell was caught between third and home on a wild pitch that ricocheted hard back to the catcher. After this blunder the Braves again went quiet for a couple of innings before Bunnell redeemed himself with a game-tying leadoff home run in the ninth inning. Outside of home runs Mississippi really couldn’t do anything productive all game and in the tenth inning failed to advance the runner from second base and took a walk off loss.</p>\n<p>Mississippi probably hoped for some length from opener Hayden Deal, but he got beat up in the second inning and they had a revolving door of arms from that point on. Deal gave the Braves a shutdown inning in the first after Malloy’s home run but allowed consecutive four pitch walks to open the second. He then allowed two hits to score three runs and give Biloxi a lead before being pulled from the game. Coleman Huntley was able to escape that inning with no further damage and gave Mississippi 1 2⁄3 innings of scoreless ball in relief. Jake Higginbotham allowed a run in the fourth inning but after that the Mississippi relief corp was fantastic and shut down the Shuckers bats. Jasseel De La Cruz gave them two scoreless innings for at least a little bit of bulk action and then Justin Maese, Indigo Diaz, and Justin Yeager each took one of the late innings to help send it to extras. There Mississippi would turn to Lisandro Santos to try to extend the game to an 11th inning. Santos gave up a hard hit ball to the first batter of the inning however Bunnell was there in the hole to make a solid back hand stop and throw to keep the runner at second base. Then Santos allowed a weak liner up the middle and as baseball is apt to do this is the one that got down for a hit. Bunnell fielded the ball in the infield, but with no time to get the runner at first tried to make a play on the runner who had stopped to see if the ball would fall but unfortunately the throw sailed wide and all runners were safe. They next batter laid down a bunt and Santos couldn’t get the throw home in time to get the runner. </p>\n<p>Next Game: 9/13 vs (67-58) Montgomery Biscuits @ 7:35 PM ET</p>\n<p></p>\n(74-54) Rome Braves 4, (66-645) Hickory Crawdads 2\n<p>Box Score</p>\n\nTyler Tolve, C: 1-4, HR, BB, 3 RBI, .261/.338/.470\nAdam Zebrowski, DH: 1-3, HR, BB, RBI, .114/.179/.200\nCaleb Durbin, 3B: 2-3, 2B, BB, .220/.306/.330\nDylan Spain, SP: 1 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 0 K, 5.30 ERA\nAlex Segal, RP: 1 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 3 K, 0.79 ERA\n\n<p>Rome was out-hit 11 to 6 in this game, but they made the most of their hits to take a win in the regular season finale. The Braves struck first in the second inning with Adam Zebrowski’s first High-A home run giving them a 1-0 lead. Hickory answered with a run in the bottom of the second inning but the Rome bats had more firepower left and didn’t let the game stay tied for long. A throwing error to lead off the third inning became a critical play in this game as following that and a base hit from Geraldo Quintero the Braves would take a 4-1 lead on a Tyler Tolve home run. Hickory never came back in this game and it’s a good thing they didn’t because Rome did a whole lot of nothing after that inning. Their biggest opportunity to add insurance runs came following a leadoff double from Caleb Durbin in the eighth inning but two of the next three guys struck out and Durbin never advanced past second.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for Rome their offense’s well-timed home runs were matched equally by Hickory’s inability to come through in the clutch. Rome’s bullpen had a tall task to cover in this game and used eighth pitchers to get through the win. The first of those was Dylan Spain and his outing lasted only six batters as that’s all it took to get through a 1-2-3 first inning. Ronaldo Alesandro took the only multi-inning outing of the game, and though he allowed a run in the second inning he left with Rome holding that 4-1 lead. Trey Riley, Davis Schwab, and Alex Segal each gave the Braves a scoreless of relief to send them to the final third of the game holding a 4-1 lead. Benjamin Dum struggled in the seventh inning with three hits and a walk allowed, but thanks to a double play erasing one of those hits was able to escape with only one run allowed. Alec Barger got into the biggest trouble of the game after allowing a leadoff double and then a single in the eighth inning, but forced a pop out to first base, a strike out, and then a fly out to hold tight to that 4-2 lead. Jake McSteen also allowed two hits in the ninth inning, but he too was able to strand the tying run and close out a Rome win. </p>\n<p>Next Game: 9/13 vs (78-52) Bowling Green Hot Rods @ 7:00 PM ET</p>\n<p></p>\n(69-62) Augusta GreenJackets 5, (58-74) Kannapolis Cannonballers 6\n<p>Box Score</p>\n\nDavid McCabe, 3B: 3-5, 2B, 2 RBI, .260/.347/.350\nNoah Williams, RF: 2-3, BB, .353/.450/.471\nIgnacio Alvarez, SS: 1-4, BB, .294/.493/.373\nBlake Burkhalter, SP: 3 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 6 K, 0.00 ERA\nCedric De Grandpre, RP: 1.2 IP, 3 H, 4 R, 3 ER, 2 BB, 2 K, 12.71 ERA\n\n<p>Augusta exploded for a five run third inning, but the bullpen was atrocious in a season-ending loss to Kannapolis. After neither team scored in the first two innings Noah Williams got Augusta started in the third, beating out a ground ball to short for an infield single. After Kannapolis removed their starter Jonathan Cannon the GreenJackets went off with Nacho Alvarez taking a walk and then Drake Baldwin and David McCabe getting hits to put them up 3-0. EJ Exposito singled to score McCabe for the fourth run of the inning and Stephen Paolini capped off the scoring with an RBI single of his own. Augusta didn’t put any more runs on the board in this game, and it wasn’t necessarily lack of opportunity either. Alvarez led off the seventh inning with a single, but he was thrown out trying to steal second base and this may have been an important play as Augusta failed to score after they recorded two two-out hits in the inning. The GreenJackets got two runners on with one out in the eighth inning for the top of the order but Alvarez and Kevin Kilpatrick grounded out to end the final scoring threat of the game. </p>\n<p>Blake Burkhalter was absolutely untouchable for Augusta, and gave them three of the best innings of pitching they’ve seen all year. He struck out six consecutive batters at one point in this start and retired all nine batters he faced in the game. His primary strikeout offering was his plus cutter high and away from right handed batters but he also was able to whiffs on his changeup, his four seam fastball up, and a slightly slower and thus more vertical variation on his cut fastball. After Burkhalter left the GreenJackets had fewer answers to the question of getting outs. Cedric De Grandpre was coming off of a fantastic outing his last time out, but lacked the control of this game and he struggled. He allowed an unearned run in the fourth inning but all of those from the fifth were his responsibility. De Grandpre allowed a leadoff walk and then a single to put two runners on early. He got two outs to put himself on the verge of escape, but a two run single snuffed his start and put Kannapolis within a run.</p>\n<p> Peyton Williams escaped the fifth but had his own issues in the sixth. Now you may not remember all of the way back in April, but I recapped this game so I remember in painful detail the Augusta season opener. Our pal Royber Salinas made a terrific debut and Augusta was cruising to a win until the ninth inning when Peyton Williams blew the save on a three-run home run. Well, Williams now has the unfortunate distinction of having blown the season opener and season finale although this came in much less painful fashion. This time it was just the sixth inning, and a leadoff double and a single had Williams in very early trouble. Fortunately he made up for this by cutting down a runner at home on a comebacker but then allowed a walk to load the bases. An infield fly got Williams the second out but it was not meant for Augusta to escape. The next batter hit a ball deep in the hole and Nacho Alvarez came up with a good play to keep it from going into left field. He then bounced the throw to first base and McCabe couldn’t come up with it allowing the go-ahead run to score on what was ruled a hit and then throwing error on Alvarez. Juan Mateo pitched two scoreless innings in relief following this, but Augusta never made a comeback and Williams was stuck with the loss. </p>\n<p>Next Game: 9/10 @ (57-73) Kannapolis Cannonballers @ 7:00 PM ET</p>",

        "description": "<p>LONDON — Downing Street has rowed back over leaked government guidance for world leaders traveling to Queen Elizabeth’s funeral that required them to abandon their official cars and arrive by shuttle bus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Official documents issued to overseas embassies and obtained by POLITICO Sunday stated world leaders “will be required” to leave their personal vehicles at a site in west London on September 19 and attend the funeral in shared coaches. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) blamed “tight security and road restrictions” for the measure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday the prime minister’s official spokesman confirmed the U.K. government — rather than Buckingham Palace — is taking the lead on logistical arrangements, but refused to comment on specific details “for operational security arrangements.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But asked if U.S. President Joe Biden would really be expected to arrive at Westminster Abbey on a bus, the spokesman said it would be left to the U.S. leader to decide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think that would be a question for the U.S. and how they prefer the president to travel,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I would say that clearly arrangements for leaders, including how they travel, will vary depending on individual circumstances. And the guidance and information provided is guidance.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The private document sent to embassies Saturday evening was unequivocal, however. “Overseas representatives invited to attend the state funeral will be required to travel in escorted coaches via [a location in west London], where their own vehicles may wait,” it said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The document also advised world leaders to take commercial flights to the U.K. where possible, but said private jets could be used if arriving at London’s less-busy airports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier Monday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he would ignore the guidance and attend the funeral in his official jet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I will travel this Thursday night from Australia,” Albanese told ABC Breakfast. “Those plans have been in place for a long period of time, since well before I became prime minister.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles told ABC Radio National that it would not be “sensible” for a world leader like Albanese to take a commercial flight, despite the FCDO advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marles, who also serves as Australia’s defense minister, said security was the “paramount consideration.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There are real issues of having prime ministers on commercial planes in terms of the security of the public who are also on those planes. So we’ve got to be sensible about this,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the list of confirmed guests continues to grow for a diplomatic event with few parallels in recent times. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Italian President Sergio Mattarella, Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin and South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol confirmed their attendance Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern had already done so last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also likely to attend the funeral are Japan’s Emperor Naruhito, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and French President Emmanuel Macron, among many more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not yet confirmed whether he will travel to London. There has been no word yet from Chinese President Xi Jinping, who will leave China this week for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began to attend a summit in Central Asia.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The U.N.’s nuclear watchdog on Monday laid out plans for establishing a security protection zone around Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in the south of Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to “keep things simple,” said Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). “What we need here, really, is to have Ukraine and Russia not attacking or not shelling at the plant.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The establishment of a security zone would be “a commitment that no military action will include or will imply aiming at the plant or at a radius affecting its normal operation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IAEA would ensure that the security perimeter is respected, Grossi added: “We have our monitors, inspectors there that can inform whether this is being observed or not.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grossi said the plan is being discussed with Ukraine and Russia, and that he has “seen signs that they are interested in this agreement.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly called for the full demilitarization of the plant and criticized Grossi for not speaking out more forcefully in favor of that idea. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking at a press conference Monday, Grossi said: “I’m working within my mandate. I cannot get into areas that have to do with larger demilitarization or movement of troops.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was seized by Russian troops in March near the start of the war, but is still operated by Ukrainian staff. Despite the restoration of a backup power line after it was damaged from shelling, the last operating unit at the plant was shut down on Sunday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grossi cautioned that “you cannot stay without any external source of power … without damaging a number of parts, notably the turbine blades” of the reactors. Power is also required to keep their cooling systems running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that, according to the agency’s information, Ukraine is trying to “keep the plant operational” by restoring external power supply. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IAEA chief also warned that as “the shelling continues,” if a missile was to hit a reactor or the facilities where the spent nuclear fuel is stored, it “could have very serious consequences.”</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Alex Trautwig/MLB via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Nicky nukes are a rare treat</p> <p>Home runs are cool. They’re big, they’re loud, and they’re the most efficient way to score runs in this silly little sport. Chicks dig them. Aaron Judge has been the story of baseball this year: the big slugger donning the pinstripes chasing down Roger Maris’s AL home run record in a walk year that will almost certainly end with an MVP award. Pete Alonso was the NL Rookie of the Year in 2019 thanks to a monster 53-homer season, breaking the rookie record set two years prior by Judge. Also happening in 2017: Giancarlo Stanton earned NL MVP honors with his 59 home runs, the most in a season since Barry Bonds ate a balanced breakfast daily in 2001.</p>\n<p>But I’m not here to talk about those guys. They get enough attention as it is. As cool as the many-homer seasons are, there is a different genre of dinger that I find more appealing: the unicorns. The rare round-trippers. The guys that you aren’t convinced are physically capable of hitting a baseball over 360 feet catching one just right and putting a charge in it. I love these homers. Pitchers face these guys thinking “It’s not the end of the world if I miss down the middle, it won’t hurt that bad.” Seconds later, they’re watching the ball sail into the outfield seats and contemplating their life choices. “Why did I throw the slider? Maybe I should have stayed as a shortstop. Did I leave the oven on?”</p>\n<p>Norichika Aoki played 132 regular season games in his only season with the Royals. He hit exactly one home run that year. Do you remember it? I remember it. An evening in Phoenix. A huge night for a typically anemic Royals offense, with Aoki providing the dagger:</p>\n\n<p>Omar Infante played 298 games, almost two full seasons’ worth, for Kansas City. He hit eight home runs in that stretch. He was also worth -1.1 fWAR. You might say he wasn’t very good, or that the Royals should have moved on sooner. But he accomplished something that Alex Gordon, Billy Butler, and Eric Hosmer all failed to do in the 2014 World Series:</p>\n\n<p>No wonder Hunter Strickland was so upset, he had just done the baseball equivalent to slipping on a banana peel. He likely contemplated retirement after this, but he hung in there and has achieved an illustrious career as a mediocre journeyman relief pitcher. There are plenty of guys like that out there, but Strickland can say something that the Emilio Pagán’s and Dominic Leone’s of the world cannot: “I gave up a home run to Omar goddamn Infante in the World Series.” </p>\n<p>The Royals currently have a player on the roster whose homers almost seem like they happen by accident: Nicholas Lopez. This comes as no surprise. Nicky has finished in the bottom 6% of baseball in hard-hit rate every season of his career. Funny enough, he actually managed a maximum exit velo of 107.9 mph last season. That’s higher than Cody Bellinger, Alex Bregman, and Wil Myers all managed last year. That doesn’t sound right, but I’m serious, just look at that leaderboard. Would you like to see Nicky Lopez hit a ball 107.9 mph? Of course you would:</p>\n\n<p>That’s a little anti-climatic: a line drive single up the middle late in a September blowout between two non-contending teams. The stakes don’t get much lower than that. His hardest hit ball of the season actually just happened last night (probably not last night by the time you’re reading this but that’s when I’m writing this paragraph so deal with it). It came off the bat at 106.7 mph. Let’s see what happened:</p>\n\n<p>Exit velo isn’t everything. I don’t care how hard you hit the ball, if it comes off the bat at -18 degrees, it’s typically gonna result in an out. Lopez’s hardest batted ball this season traveled only five feet in the air and was an easy out to end the inning. Lopez has hit 27 balls over 100 mph this season with 14 going for hits, but only two have gone for extra bases. </p>\n<p>With that digression aside...what was I writing about? Right, dingers. Bombs. Jimmy Jacks. Dongs. Nicky Lopez has not hit one this year. In his first three years in the majors, Nicky homered about once every 232 plate appearances. This season, he has 450 plate appearances without a long ball. Fortunately for Lopez, he doesn’t have the longest active homer drought this year. That ignominious distinction belongs to Myles Straw, who has 509 plate appearances without going yarbo this year. </p>\n<p>If you’re reading this and your name is Nicky Lopez, I have an idea. Let’s try some visualization, that’s a big thing among athletes. We’ll do this by reviewing the homers you’ve hit in the majors and see what we can take away. If your name is not Nicky Lopez, we’re still going to look at all his homers because they’re delightful little treats that we should treasure. Let’s dive in.</p>\nHome run #1: June 13, 2019 vs. Detroit\n<p>Nicky’s first career homer is potentially the most fascinating. Let’s start by reviewing the film. This is not as straightforward as it seems. This was no ordinary matchup. This was MLB in Omaha, a gambit by MLB to try to connect their product to College Baseball (which is a superior product, don’t @ me). This game was played at TD Ameritrade Park two days before the College World Series. What better way to promote Major League Baseball to the people of Omaha than a matchup between two of the worst teams in the sport? </p>\n<p>I am hesitant to give any branch of MLB credit for anything, but I will give credit to MLBAM: they do a very good job making video for just about anything available online via MLB Film Room. One can easily run a search to find film for all of Nicky Lopez’s home runs. At least in theory. But here we run into a problem:</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>Here we see four regular season bombs and one from Spring Training. Where’s his first career dong? If you remember this game, the ESPN broadcast experienced technical difficulties in the second inning, so the only people that got to see Nicky’s homer in real-time were those at the game. To this day the video does not exist on YouTube. I thought finding video of this homer might be akin to finding Bigfoot, but I managed to track down it down. The home run video I mean, not Bigfoot:</p>\n\n<p>Imagine that: you hit your first career home run and the film of it looks like it’s straight out of 2009. Since it was hit in a college park, there’s no Statcast data available for it. Perhaps this was actually Nicky’s hardest hit ball, but we’ll never know. I also have no idea what pitch it was, but according to the box score on MLB.com, it was middle-middle. If anybody out there has the Zapruder film of this home run, please share. </p>\n<p>In terms of game situation, this was a fairly run-of-the-mill bomb. A second-inning leadoff shot that put the Royals on the board en route to a handy 7-3 victory. In addition to giving the Royals the lead, it also gave the baseball world a fascinating nugget of trivia. Question: who is the only player to hit a home run in a Major League Baseball game in the state of Nebraska? Answer: Nicky Lopez. What a silly sport this is. </p>\n<p>Perhaps ballpark familiarity was at play here. Lopez played his college ball at Creighton, which plays their home games at TD Ameritrade Park (now Charles Schwab Field). Then again, Nicky Lopez hit only two homers in his collegiate career, and both were on the road. To summarize: Nicky played 146 college baseball games and never went yard at his home ballpark. In one major league game in that same ballpark, he cleared the fence. </p>\n<p>Also, the Royals lineup that day was something of a murderers’ row, featuring Cheslor Cuthbert batting third and a fearsome bottom third of Martin Maldonado, Terrance Gore, and Billy Hamilton. No wonder that team lost 103 games.</p>\nHome run #2: August 19, 2019 vs. Baltimore\n<p>Nicky’s second career dong introduced another lovely genre of home run: the dinger before the score bug has loaded:</p>\n\n<p>In terms of game situation, this shot was big: a leadoff job that gave Kansas City a 4-2 lead. They would eventually go on to win 5-4. The pitch was a 94.4 mph four-seamer up-and-in from Gabriel Ynoa that Lopez turned on and yanked into the flag court in right field. This wasn’t a cheap shot either, traveling 393 feet. The location on the pitch really wasn’t bad. Lopez had just a .265 xWOBA on pitches high and tight in 2019 and averaged just 77.7 mph on batted balls in that zone. Lopez just managed to get to this one. This was one of only four barrels he had that season. Although he may have had five, since perhaps that first homer was also a barrel. </p>\nHome run #3: August 8, 2020 vs. Minnesota\n<p>It would be almost a full year between home runs two and three for Nicky. That sounds bad, but that was mostly because of the pandemic as he played 36 games between homers, which is less bad. </p>\n\n<p>Lewis Thorpe screwed up pretty badly on this one. The pitch was an 80.5 mph slider that hung right down Broadway. That’s about as hittable of a pitch as one can ask for and Lopez took advantage, smoking it to the Bepis Party Porch. I think this can largely be attributed to the pandemic hair he was rocking here. Just look at it bounce as he rounds the bases. Don’t look at the rest of his season numbers, just trust me on this.</p>\nHome run #4: August 19, 2021 vs. Houston\n<p>It would be over a year before Lopez left the yard again, and this time there were no pandemic cancellations to blame. That said, 2021 was Lopez’s “breakout” season. Entering play on August 19, he had a line of .277/.347/.345, and he was coming off a three-hit game the previous night. This was a two-run shot that gave Kansas City a 3-0 lead:</p>\n\n<p>This was his first homer off a good pitcher, as Luis Garcia was in the midst of a very nice rookie campaign. The pitch was a 1-0 curveball that floated in at 76.6 mph. The location wasn’t awful, but it caught enough of the zone that Nicky was able to drop the barrel on it and drive it to right. The exit velo on this was unexceptional: at 98.2 mph, it was just Nicky’s 57th hardest-hit batted ball in 2021. But he got it in the air enough to send it to the Royals bullpen. This was less a bomb and more a lovely pitching wedge shot placed on the green with precision. It still went 381 feet, so count it.</p>\nHome run #5: September 9th, 2021 vs. Baltimore\n<p>You might get some déjà vu from this one:</p>\n\n<p>A slightly-above-average-velo four-seamer high and tight that Nicky turns on. In Baltimore. The stars were aligned as the ball sailed into a mostly empty section of the stands in right-center. This put Kansas City on the board en route to a 6-0 win. </p>\n<p>So we have five homers off the bat of Nicky Nukes to enjoy. What can we take away from this? Nothing, really, but here are some facts you can file under “Stats That Exist But Do Not Matter”:</p>\n\nLopez has hit just as many dingers in Baltimore as he has in his home park. That is the only regular road ballpark that he has homered in.\nThe platoon advantage is meaningless: three of Lopez’s five homers came against lefty pitchers.\nLopez’s longballs come early in the count: one was on the first pitch, while the other four were all on 1-0 pitches.\nNone of the tanks came on pitches away. On a related note, I would bet a large sum of money that Lopez will never hit a homer to center or left field.\nLopez is a second-half hitter: four of the five homers came in August or September. \n\n<p>Bringing this back around now, we’ve seen five homers from Lopez and none have come in 2022. Perhaps that’s in part due to the deadened ball that’s been used for at least part of this season. It also isn’t helping that Lopez isn’t hitting pull-side flyballs. As I mentioned earlier, he probably doesn’t have the raw power to go oppo taco or straightaway, so pulling flyballs is the only way he’ll hit them over the fence. Check out where Lopez’s batted balls with at least 10 degrees of launch angle have gone this year:</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>I’m not advocating for Nicky to start trying to hit more homers, but I figured he would have accidentally run into one by now. He’s been close a few times, with the following being the most notable examples:</p>\n\n\n<p>Nicky Lopez vs Caleb Smith#TogetherRoyalFlyout  Exit velo: 97.7 mphLaunch angle: 38 degProj. distance: 359 ftThis would have been a home run in 17/30 MLB ballparksKC (5) @ ARI (7)  5th pic.twitter.com/sBtpKs6lUg</p>— Would it dong?

(@would_it_dong) August 24, 2022\n\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, August has come and gone, and the Royals have already played their series in Baltimore, but there is still hope. The Royals have 21 games remaining, including series’ against poor pitching staffs like Boston and Minnesota. It’ll be hard to earn a cheap shot, as none of the remaining road games are at ballparks with high home run factors. Here’s hoping Nicky can put a charge in one and avoid finishing the season with a goose egg.</p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>A major U.S. military-funded think tank is fed up with America’s failure to seriously punish North Korea for conducting nuclear and missile tests and warning that the U.S. must make clear “the potential consequences that would be imposed for those provocations.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report by RAND Corporation and the Asan Institute in Seoul should give rise to introspection by American and South Korean diplomats as they consider their mistakes in dealing with the North. For many years, we’ve held false hopes on high, seeing eventual success in talks that garner global publicity, producing nice-sounding statements and promises that ultimately are forgotten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RAND, funded in large measure by U.S. Army and Air Force contracts, and the Asan Institute would like to reverse that trend. Their report on North Korea’s vast weapons of mass destruction program concludes by admonishing Washington policymakers for their reluctance to go beyond outraged words and sanctions. After North Korea’s multiple missile tests — most recently the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile in March that North Korea claimed was a long-range Hwasong-17 capable of carrying a warhead to targets anywhere in the U.S. — the report provides a much-needed reality check.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As North Korea prepares for its seventh underground nuclear test, the RAND-Asan report scolds both Washington and Seoul for their wavering responses to North Korea’s aggressive threats against the U.S. and South Korea. It’s far from clear, though, that the message is really getting through, at least to judge from the bland, predictable comments from South Korean and foreign influencers, including military officers, from 54 countries at last week’s Seoul Defense Dialogue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Korea’s vice defense minister, Shin Beom-chul, sounded pretty tough when he told the gathering “there should be severe consequences” if North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un orders a seventh nuclear test. Indeed, “We may have a counter-attack against North Korea,” he said. “We are strengthening the [U.S.-South Korea] alliance.” As others quickly noted, however, there was no real sign that the Koreans and Americans are doing much, if anything, to back up the tough words with action while waiting to see if Kim orders another nuclear test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test since exploding what may have been a hydrogen bomb in September 2017 but has raised the decibel level of its propaganda since the South’s conservative President Yoon Suk-yeol authorized the first U.S.-South Korean military field exercises in five years. North Korea denounced the war games, which recently ended, as preparation for “invasion.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alison Hooker, in charge of Korean issues on the National Security Council during Donald Trump’s presidency, injected a certain realism into the Seoul Defense Dialogue’s session on denuclearization of North Korea. “It’s unclear whether a seventh nuclear test will be sufficiently shocking,” she said, decrying “the international community’s inability to muster a strong response” to North Korea’s test of a long-range hypersonic missile. “We must work to prevent further expansion of their nuclear program,” she urged, but the prospect of both Russia and China vetoing any firm UN Security Council resolution makes that “very difficult.” North Korea, she said, believes a nuclear threat “deters invasion.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, North Korea knows that the U.S. and South Korea “threaten the North with strong rhetoric but are weak on imposing the threatened costs,” says the RAND/Asan report. “As a result, this rhetoric has little influence in deterring North Korea.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report states bluntly that typical warnings of “consequences cannot be idle threats.” South Korea and the U.S. “must have the will to execute them,” it says, “or future deterrence would be undercut.” Such rhetoric, it says, “has little influence on deterring North Korea.” The North needs to know there will be “real responses” from the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, says the report, “the North might feel safe to challenge the ROK-U.S. with provocations below the minimum red lines.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RAND/Asan report focused not on the North’s nuclear program but on OWMD — “Other Weapons of Mass Destruction, notably chemical and nuclear weapons as well as cyber threats.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among key findings, the report accuses the North of “apparently testing chemical and biological weapons on people and carrying out some assassinations with chemical weapons.” The most notorious case, it claims, was the 2017 killing of Kim Jong Un’s older half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, by a VX chemical agent as he was about to fly from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, to his home base in Macau.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, it says, “North Korea has actively employed its cyber capabilities in peacetime to collect information, steal money and cause damage.” Consider, for instance, the hack of Sony Pictures in 2014 for “The Interview,” a wild satire that made Kim Jong Un look like both demented dictator and a total idiot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report criticizes and dishes out equal blame on North Korea and the U.S./South Korea alliance, noting North Korea’s refusal to give up its nuclear, missile and cyber programs is matched by the failure of the U.S. and South Korea to respond effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“To deter any North Korean limited employment of OWMD and cyber capabilities, the ROK-U.S. need to enhance their ability to detect and attribute North Korean attacks,” says the report. “North Korea needs to understand that even limited WMD attacks would constitute an act of war and be hard to distinguish from precursor attacks before a major invasion.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, if the U.S. and South Korea judge that “a major war is actually starting, they would be fully justified in launching an early conventional counterforce response to eliminate North Korean missiles and nuclear weapons.” ROK-U.S. military planning, the report says, “needs to assume that a North Korean invasion of the ROK would include the employment of nuclear weapons, OWMD, and major cyberattacks.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strong words — but who’s listening? Both the U.S. and South Korea would hope to avoid a war. The RAND/Asan report is more a cautionary note than a call to arms. Over the years, RAND has been quite influential. We can only hope that military planners in Washington and Seoul will be reading it and taking its advice seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Donald Kirk has been a journalist for more than 60 years, focusing much of his career on conflict in Asia and the Middle East, including as a correspondent for the Washington Star and Chicago Tribune. He currently is a freelance correspondent covering North and South Korea. He is the author of several books about Asian affairs.</p>",

Turner’s turnaround is the focus of Monday morning’s Leading Off with True Blue LA podcast.</p>\n<p>Turner was struggling mightily, with just an 82 wRC+ during his first 69 games, but some mechanical changes helped Turner to rediscover his usual, productive self. Since June 30, Turner is hitting a whopping .371/.440/.616 with eight home runs and 12 doubles in 43 games. Only Aaron Judge has a higher OPS in MLB during that time.</p>\n<p>The timing of that turnaround might be coincidental. But it started with two home runs off Padres right-hander Joe Musgrove, who said of Turner after the start — a 3-1 Dodgers win — “I don’t what his numbers are against me. ... When he’s in the box, I don’t feel like he’s a huge threat.” </p>\n<p>Turner homered again off Musgrove on Sunday, and added a grand slam off Craig Stammen to blow the game open. The Dodgers are back in the postseason, and with a magic number of two, they will clinch their ninth division title in 10 years any day now. Maybe even Tuesday.</p>\n<p>After a weekend that saw Blake Treinen land back on the injured list, this week figures to bring decisions on a few pitchers. Tommy Kahnle, Victor González, and Danny Duffy are all on the 60-day injured list, and their rehab assignments are up soon.</p>\n\nPodcast links\n<p>Ways to listen</p>\n<p>RSS feed</p>\n<p>Episode link (time: 21:42)</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Brandon Sloter/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>With a small army of players returning from the IL, the Yankees need to make some space on both the active and 40-man rosters.</p> <p>If residents of Scranton, Pennsylvania, have thought that the members of the current Yankees roster looked familiar, there’s a good reason for that. The Yankees injured list looks fuller than it has since 2019, the season known for its #NextManUp mantra: Anthony Rizzo, DJ LeMahieu, Matt Carpenter, and Andrew Benintendi are currently on the 10-man IL, Aroldis Chapman, Scott Effross, Albert Abreu, and Luis Severino are on the 15-day, and Harrison Bader, Luis Gil, Zack Britton, Miguel Castro, Chad Green, Michael King, and Stephen Ridings occupy the 60-day.</p>\n<p>While some of these players won’t be seen until 2023 at the earliest — sorry, King, Gil, and Green (and probably Ridings, too, who hasn’t had many updates) — many of these players are currently working their way back. All of Bader, Britton, Castro, Chapman, and Severino are in the midst of rehab assignments, Effross threw a bullpen this weekend, and Rizzo returned to the dugout this past weekend after his headaches began to subside. Assuming their comeback paths continue to go smoothly, these players will need to be added to the active roster, and in the case of Britton, Castro, Sevy, and Bader, to the 40-man as well. A roster crunch, or rather, two roster crunches, are incoming.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the moves are fairly straightforward. The Yankees already have a free spot on the 40-man, and could easily gain another by transferring Albert Abreu to the 60-day IL — although Aaron Boone did use him in some relatively high-leverage spots at times, for the most part he was the last arm on the totem pole and would not be missed. Furthermore, one of Estevan Florial or Tim Locastro would be optioned to Scranton to make room for Rizzo, with the other likely doing the same once Bader is ready to return. The oft-optioned Miguel Andújar is on shaky ground as well.</p>\n<p>The recovery timelines of Benintendi, Carpenter, and LeMahieu each carry their own degrees of murkiness. But they must be acknowledged as well since — while welcome — they would result in some difficult choices. Would they send down highly-touted prospect Oswald Peraza despite his solid performance, considering their continued insistence on starting Isiah Kiner-Falefa? Still, the immediate future on the position player side seems fairly straightforward. </p>\n<p>On the pitching side of things, things start to get a little tricky. With Severino, Britton, Chapman, and Castro currently in the middle of rehab assignments, the Yankees will soon need to clear four spots in the pitching staff, likely in the bullpen. Easy players to either demote or DFA, however, are few and far between. At the time of writing, this is what the Yankees pitching staff looked like, courtesy of the FanGraphs Depth Chart.</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>Despite strong outings in his trio of cameos — he’s given up just one run and six hits in 10.2 innings, throwing up zeroes in both high-leverage situations and in blowouts — Ryan Weber is the obvious candidate to jettison. He’s been designated for assignment multiple times already this year, only to clear waivers, re-sign with Triple-A Scranton, and then return to the Bronx a few weeks later. Greg Weissert, too, would likely be optioned back to Scranton — while he has largely been impressive after his disastrous debut, he has three options remaining and just a handful of MLB innings on his arm. But after those two, the decision becomes difficult.</p>\n<p>Could the team send Clarke Schmidt back to Triple-A? Although the Yankees lost the two starts he made while Nestor Cortes was on the shelf, he has been a dominant multi-inning reliever for the Yankees this year, as he posted a 2.18 ERA and limited opponents to a .207/.316/.310 slash in 17 relief appearances; of those, he went more than one inning 11 times. While far from a Michael King replacement, he’s been able to bridge the gap to the back of the bullpen when the starter did not go long, eat innings late in a blowout, and even pitch high-leverage innings in close games. If Weber and Weissert were sent down, he’d be the last current reliever capable of lengthy outings left in the bullpen (though Domingo Germán could slide to the ‘pen upon Severino’s return).</p>\n<p>Might the team send Ron Marinaccio down in favor of a veteran arm again? They’ve already done that in the past, sending him down in both July and August because he still had options remaining. He has been one of the Yankees’ more reliable relievers this year, giving up just nine runs all season. Since the beginning of June, Marinaccio has given up just two earned runs and limited opposing batters to a .118/.259/.194 slash line in 29 innings. Although his 12.9 BB% is higher than the team would certainly like, he makes up for it with a high strikeout rate (29.9 K%, ranked 41st among the league’s 231 relievers with at least 30 innings) and an ability to avoid hard contact (opponents have just a .158 xBA and .253 xSLG against him according to Statcast, along with just five barrels). Marinaccio’s pace has slowed a little bit in the last few weeks, so perhaps the Yankeees would use that as an excuse to farm him out again.</p>\n<p>It goes on and on, albeit with relievers much less likely to disappear. Lou Trivino has been lights-out since coming to the Yankees as an ancillary part of the Frankie Montas deal with the Oakland Athletics. He’s given up just one earned run in 15 appearances, and has helped the Yankees escape trouble on more than one occasion by pulling a Houdini act in a high-leverage situation. After struggling with both injuries and ineffectiveness at the start of the season, Jonathan Loáisiga has been lights out of late, allowing just one run and keeping batters to a .125/.167/.125 slash line since August 14th. Lucas Luetge, too, has been peaking at the right time. And Wandy Peralta has arguably been the team’s most consistent reliever this season.</p>\n<p>Having too many players and not enough roster spots is a good problem to have, and fresh injuries always feel like they’re right around the corner. So at the very least, the current 40-man provides some insurance policy. But at the end of the day, it’s still a problem that needs to be solved. How the Yankees decide to approach this roster crunch will likely have a major impact on the pennant race.</p>\n<p>We’ll see in time whether the team makes the right choices.</p>",

It stands like a protective wall, its four floors of offices framed by horizontal bands of abstract concrete reliefs and slender vertical fins, punctuated by a staccato rhythm of Corbusian bullhorn lamps. The taut ribbon of offices projects out over the street, sheltering a long parade of shops, and leaps over a road supported on dramatic angled columns – compared by their architect, James Roberts, to “the massive feet of a Martian monster”.</p><p>Built in 1962, as highway fever was sweeping the city, the Ringway was the ultimate expression of “carchitecture”: a building designed to be taken in at speed.

        "description": "<p>Air pollution can trigger lung cancer in people who don't smoke, according to new research from the Francis Crick Institute and University College London.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a study of roughly half a million people living in England, South Korea and Taiwan, researchers found more exposure to air pollution particles was linked to an increased risk of developing a mutation in the EGFR gene, which is known to cause non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research sheds new light on the dangers of air pollution. NSCLC, one of two major types of lung cancer, is mostly linked to smoking but air pollution has long been considered another danger. NSCLC kills 250,000 people across the world annually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charles Swanton, the chief clinician at Francis Crick Institute and Cancer Research UK and a lead study author, said the \"risk of lung cancer from air pollution is lower than from smoking, but we have no control over what we all breathe.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Globally, more people are exposed to unsafe levels of air pollution than to toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke, and these new data link the importance of addressing climate health to improving human health,\" Swanton said in a statement Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research was presented on Saturday at the 2022 ESMO Congress in Paris, a major gathering of leading health care researchers and representatives from across the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Air pollution disproportionately impacts low-income communities and people of color and has been linked to other negative health effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A study published last month showed even a slight increase of the amount of nitrogen dioxide in the air is linked to increased health care costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most polluted states in the U.S. include Louisiana, Texas, Utah and Ohio, while the least polluted include Vermont, Idaho, California and Wyoming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Francis Crick Institute study, researchers discovered that higher exposure to 2.5 micrometers of particulate matter (PM 2.5) — a common, inhalable particle emitted primarily from vehicles  — increased the development of not only EGFR mutation but also in KRAS, another gene liked to lung cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swanton said the mutations in the EGFR and KRAS genes are present in normal lung tissue as a consequence of aging, but \"when lung cells with these mutations were exposed to air pollutants, we saw more cancers.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"These occurred more quickly than when lung cells with these mutations were not exposed to pollutants, suggesting that air pollution promotes the initiation of lung cancer in cells harboring driver gene mutations,\" Swanton said.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/3638758-trump-fighting-doj-request-to-review-classified-docs/",
        "description": "<p>Former President Trump is fighting a request from the Department of Justice (DOJ) to allow its review of classified materials taken from Mar-a-Lago to continue, with Trump’s legal team arguing the investigation “at its core is a document storage dispute that has spiraled out of control.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filing continues to assert the former president has broad power to control his records even after he leaves office, even the classified records that the Justice Department argued Trump can have no possible claim to, and thus do not require review by a third-party special master.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the filing, Trump’s legal team pushed back against the idea that there was any possible damage from the mishandling of records.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There is no indication any purported ‘classified records’ were disclosed to anyone. Indeed, it appears such ‘classified records,’ along with the other seized materials, were principally located in storage boxes in a locked room at Mar-a-Lago, a secure, controlled access compound utilized regularly to conduct the official business of the United States during the Trump Presidency, which to this day is monitored by the United States Secret Service,” they wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The response from Trump’s team came after the Justice Department last Thursday indicated it planned to appeal a federal district court judge’s ruling green-lighting a special master, also asking her to approve a partial stay that would exclude some 300 classified records from their review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The classification markings establish on the face of the documents that they are government records, not Plaintiff’s personal records,\" the DOJ wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And for several reasons, no potential assertion of executive privilege could justify restricting the executive branch’s review and use of the classified records at issue here.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Trump’s team claimed Monday that classification status matters little within the Presidential Records Act (PRA) and that Trump’s document issues should be sorted with the National Archives, or NARA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Of course, classified or declassified, the documents remain either presidential records or personal records under the PRA,” they wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“At best, the government might ultimately be able to establish certain presidential records should be returned to NARA. What is clear regarding all of the seized materials is that they belong with either President Trump … or with NARA, but not with the Department of Justice.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brief also seeks to undercut the heart of the Justice Department’s argument that its criminal investigation is “inextricably intertwined” with a separate intelligence community review of the documents led by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) that the judge allowed to continue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FBI is part of the intelligence community and would be the agency responsible for investigating any mishandling of intelligence that the review uncovers, DOJ said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though in a Friday night filing the Trump legal team said a special master should be afforded three months to complete a review of the documents, in its latest brief to the court it said the investigation could withstand a “brief pause.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also alleges the ODNI damage assessment into potential fallout from the mishandling of the records is a way to further DOJ's criminal investigation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The government contends that the FBI and ODNI, and their personnel, are so inseparable they are incapable of having agents outside the criminal case participate in the ODNI-led investigation. This convenient, and belated, claim by the Government relative to enjoining the criminal team’s access to these documents only arises because the FBI concedes the intelligence community review is actually just another facet of its criminal investigation,” Trump’s legal team wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filing is the closest Trump’s legal team has gotten to repeating claims by the former president that he declassified the information found in his home – but they stop short of actually doing so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brief spends a few pages noting that presidents have the power to declassify documents but never say that Trump actually did so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The government’s stance assumes that if a document has a classification marking, it remains classified irrespective of any actions taken during President Trump's term in office,” Trump’s legal team wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There is no legitimate contention that the chief executive’s declassification of documents requires approval of bureaucratic components of the executive branch. Yet, the government apparently contends that President Trump, who had full authority to declassify documents, ‘willfully’ retained classified information in violation of the law,” they added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an earlier round of filings, the DOJ noted that in the months of discussions Trump’s legal team never raised the prospect that the former president had declassified the intelligence material at his home, nor had they offered any explanation for why he had roughly 10,000 government records stored there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A response brief from Trump’s team the next day was silent on those matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>— Updated at 11:18 a.m.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>There have been as many changes to playing rules under Manfred as in the previous 100 years</p> <p>Baseball is described as America’s National Pastime because of it’s tradition. The game’s origins date back to pre-civil war days, before any other major professional sports leagues were in existence. Over time, traditions were established. At the heart of these traditions is a set of playing rules that have governed the game itself for over 160 years. </p>\n<p>Very little has changed in the basic playing rules of baseball since the National and American leagues settled on eight franchises in each league at the turn of the 20th Century. Since the first modern day World Series was held between the league winners in 1903, for a period over 50 years, there were no franchises to fold or pick up and relocate to another city. </p>\n<p>While the leagues began to expand west to the Pacific Ocean, south to Florida and Texas, and north into Canada, the playing rules have remained consistent. That is until now, when commissioner Rob Manfred decided that the game could be made better, at least according to his definition of better.  Manfred’s new “competition committee” is ushering in a host of changes for the 2023 season that fundamentally change the game. </p>\n<p>In its’ formative years, the rules of the game saw significant changes to the playing rules from the original “Knickerbocker rules” established in 1847, as well as to the equipment, statistical definitions, and the use of technology. By the time the National league was formed in 1876, the game had settled on nine men on a team, nine innings in a game- unless it was tied, an umpire called balls and strikes, a caught fly ball was an out. And always, a run was scored by a batter advancing around the bases- all four bases- and crossing home plate before three outs were recorded.</p>\n<p>There were still fundamental changes to be made to the game in the 19th century, as the game evolved from having a “pitchers box” that was anywhere from 3ft x 12 ft, to 6 ft square with the front edge being 50 feet from home plate, to a pitching mound with a rubber slab that was 60 ft, 6 inches from home. That rule was finalized in 1893. The count of four balls for a walk and three strikes you’re out was finalized in 1889. </p>\n<p>The finishing touches adopted in the last decade of the 19th century included the infield fly rule, counting foul balls as strikes until the batter had two strikes. foul bunts and held foul balls are always strikes, and the catcher’s interference rule. </p>\n<p>There were very, very few significant changes to the playing rules during the entire 20th century. In 1926, a ball that bounced over the fence became a standard “ground rule” double in all parks. The pitching mound was lowered in 1969, and the American league adopted the designated hitter rule in 1973.</p>\n<p>There were tweaks to the size of the strike zone, defensive interference, and banning of spitballs, but most of the changes had to do with statistics or technology. The definition of a sacrifice fly changed numerous times through the years, and there were changes to what constitutes a “save”. Expansion brought more playoff games, but the playing rules remained constant. </p>\n<p>Lighting was a big change, with the first night game being played in 1935. The ability to turn on the lights all but eliminated tie games, which would be called because of darkness, and then either replayed or resumed at various times. But the game was always played to a conclusion, under the same scoring rules through the final innings.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the game was the game. Baseball kept it’s traditions and it’s playing rules. </p>\n\n<p>The biggest changes to the game were in the areas of expansion from 16 to 30 teams between 1961 and 1997, and technology with first radio then television, and then cable TV bringing more games into more households than ever. The first night World Series game wasn’t staged until 1971, but now a day game is much more the exception than the rule. Post season games in particular are scheduled in “prime time” for the television audience. </p>\n<p>Technology brought in another major change to the game, though not to the playing rules themselves, with the introduction of instant replay reviews in 2008. First, home runs could be reviewed, and then reviews were expanded to almost every play except calling balls and strikes. Technology will change that, too, but playing rules remained the same.</p>\n<p>Then came Rob Manfred, with ideas to make the game better. It started with modifying the rules on runners sliding into home or breaking up a double play.  But more important to Manfred, the pace of the game was too slow, which wasn’t good for television, which in turn put a damper on profits. There was no point in playing games, in the world according to Manfred, if owners weren’t making as much money as possible. </p>\n<p>Once the owners had cashed their checks from the regional sports networks and beer concessions had closed at the ballpark, extra innings were just a waste of time. The Covid pandemic gave him just the excuse that he needed to usher in the “ghost runner” rule that was experimented with in the minor leagues, to all but eliminate the games that dragged on into multiple extra innings. If he had to destroy 150 years of tradition by changing the scoring rules to get rid of non profit baseball, so be it. While the rule was tolerated by fans in the Covid season of 2020, it was widely unpopular as MLB twice brought it back ‘for one more season’ under the guise of player health and safety. In reality, the motive can be found by following the money. </p>\n<p>The commissioner brought in seven inning double headers, and cut the season to 60 games in 2020, when many more games could have been played. This was “offset” according to the narrative, by expanding the number of playoff teams to 16. In fact, lost profits were offset, but lost salaries and lost games were not. </p>\n<p>While the players’ association filed a grievance for shortening the season, and cutting their paychecks in the process, that was withdrawn as a last concession under threat of canceling part of the 2022 season, which it seemed the owners were perfectly willing to do in bargaining, as long as the big money post season games were played. </p>\n<p>Also adopted as part of the new collective bargaining agreement was the creation of a “competition committee” that was formed to rubber stamp whatever changes to the playing rules the commissioner wanted to implement. The committee is comprised of four members representing players, one from the umpires, and six appointed by the commissioner himself. </p>\n<p>It didn’t take long for the new committee to swing into action, as they have adopted a pitch clock, a ban on defensive shifts that tell teams where their players must stand on the field, bigger bases, and restrictions on pitchers throwing to first base to keep the runner close. The players unanimously opposed the pitch clock and shift change rules, but it didn’t matter. All the commissioner’s men stood together and rammed the rules through. </p>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest change of all in the new CBA was the creation of the committee itself, because that allowed Manfred to usher in fundamental changes to the game. Under guise of a group composed of representatives from the commissioner and the players’ union, in practice, the built-in majority on the league side makes it easy for them to ram changes through while still giving the casual appearance of an independent body.</p>\n<p>Players are not without culpability in the changes to the playing rules. They have gone along with the ghost runner each time the issue came up, and they conceded the format of the competition committee. Previously, they could at least oppose any rule changes and block them for a year. </p>\n<p>Whether the changes are good or bad is a matter of opinion. But the result is that the playing rules of baseball have undergone more significant rule changes under this commissioner’s tenure than it has seen in the previous 100 years of major league baseball. </p>",

This led directly to the start of the Revolutionary War, and America’s eventual independence from the British Empire.</p>\n\n<p>On the evening of April 18, 1775 Robert Newman and John Pulling quietly entered Old North and carefully climbed to the top of the church’s bell tower. They briefly hung two lanterns near the windows and made their escape. This signal, from the tallest structure in the town of Boston, served as an early warning that a detachment of the British Army was crossing the Charles River and heading west towards the towns of Lexington and Concord. By the end of the next night, the American Revolutionary War had begun.</p>\n\n<p>Two and a half centuries later, Old North Church is serving as the host for the British Consulate’s condolence book for Queen Elizabeth II.

        "description": "<p>From 2010 to 2020, a larger proportion of rural Americans smoked cigarettes—and their odds of quitting smoking were lower—compared to those living in urban areas, according to a new study.</p>\n<p>“Cigarette smoking prevalence is higher in rural than urban US communities, and that disparity has only increased over time,” says Maria Parker, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics in the Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington. “We wanted to see if quit ratios might account for some of rural vs. urban area smoking disparity, beyond a higher smoking prevalence.”</p>\n<p>Using deidentified data from the US Department of Health and Human Services’ 2010-20 National Survey on Drug Use, the researchers analyzed adults who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in a lifetime, which they defined as lifetime cigarette smoking.</p>\n<p>Current smoking was defined as smoking one or more cigarettes in the past month, and former smoking as no cigarettes in the past year. Overall and annual quit ratios were estimated as proportions of former smokers among lifetime smokers.</p>\n<p>The researchers found that of the 161,348 lifetime cigarette smokers analyzed, 33.5% were former smokers.</p>\n<p>In 2020, current smoking prevalence was higher in rural than urban areas—19.2% vs 14.4%. Quit ratios were similar in rural and urban areas, at 52.9% and 53.9%, respectively.</p>\n<p>However, from 2010 to 2020, the odds of quitting smoking were 75% lower in rural areas compared to urban ones. Over time, smoking quit ratios among both rural and urban populations increased.</p>\n<p>“Our findings support that a persistent rural/urban disparity exists,” Parker says. “Not only were smoking prevalence estimates higher in rural areas, but quit ratios were lower in rural areas than urban areas. Rural residents may face more barriers to using smoking cessation services than urban residents, or they may be in an earlier stage of motivation to quit.”</p>\n<p>Smoking intervention at the clinical setting, health system, or population level might improve reach and sustainability of cessation services for rural residents. Parker says that leveraging existing smoking quit lines and telehealth solutions may also help rural residents by minimizing barriers to access.</p>\n<p>“Higher cigarette smoking prevalence and lower cessation in rural populations have led to higher rates of smoking-attributable cancer incidence and death in rural, compared with urban residents,” says coauthor Andrea Villanti, associate professor in the health behavior, society and policy department at Rutgers University. “Tobacco cessation, therefore, is a high-impact target for cancer prevention efforts in rural populations.”</p>\n<p>The study appears in JAMA Network Open.

        "description": "Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>The Astros (90-50, 1st in AL West) hit the road for a quick, three-game series against the bottom feeding Tigers (54-86, 5th in AL Central)</p> Quick Notes\n<p>The Tigers are currently winding down a season best left forgotten, which has been the theme of most of their seasons in recent years.  In spite of annual predictions of improvements and dark horse commentary, Detroit has had trouble building any sort of success over the course of a full year in recent memory.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say that there haven’t been bright spots amongst the darkness, of course.  The Tigers have brought up a few exciting prospects that factor into their future and, of course, there has been the occasional milestone from Miguel Cabrera.  But, overall, there just hasn’t been much to cheer about in Motor City lately.</p>\n<p>Kerry Carpenter, who made his debut just this year, has the best stats of any Tiger across the whole of the 2022 season, but he’s only had 69 AB’s all season so it’s hardly a large body of work.  If you want someone who’s played in a majority of the game, the player with the best stats is probably catcher Eric Haase, but his .750 OPS isn’t really anything to write home about and is just another example of how anemic the Tigers’ offense has been.</p>\n<p>You can expect to see some combination of Gregory Soto, Joe Jimenez, and Andrew Chafin in high leverage roles during this series.  While their numbers may not be all the way in the elite category, these three relievers have done a decent job.  Soto, who is the primary closer, has successfully converted 25 of his 27 save opportunities, which is definitely what you want for that role.</p>\n<p>As for starters, the Astros can expect to see Eduardo Rodriguez, Drew Hutchison, and Joey Wentz this week.  All three have ERA’s hovering around 4.00 just to give you an idea of what they’ve been doing so far this season.  Although, when I say “this season” that’s not really much for Wentz, who has only logged 13.1 IP in 2022 after making his MLB debut earlier this year.</p>\n<p>Offensive Stats: YTD, Last 7 Days</p>\n<p>Pitching Stats: YTD, Last 7 Days</p>\n<p>Last 10 Games: 4-6 Record, 1 Series Win, 2 Series Loss, -19 Run Differential (36 scored, 55 allowed)</p>\n<p>W/L Splits: 30-40 at home, 24-46 on the road, 23-45 against teams over .500</p>\n<p>Injured List: Austin Meadows: 60-Day IL (mental health), Miguel Cabrera: 10-Day IL (biceps), Rony Garcia: 60-Day IL (biceps), Tarik Skubal: 60-Day IL (arm), Beau Brieske: 60-Day IL (forearm), Casey Mize: 60-Day IL (elbow), Kyle Funkhouser: 60-Day IL (shoulder), Spencer Turnbull: 60-Day IL (elbow), Jake Rogers: 60-Day IL (elbow)</p>\n\nStarters\n<p>Game 1: Framber Valdez (LHP, 14-5, 2.64 ERA, 161 K’s) vs Eduardo Rodriguez (LHP, 3-4, 4.13 ERA, 50 K’s)</p>\n<p>Game 2: Hunter Brown (RHP, 1-0, 0.00 ERA, 5 K’s) vs Drew Hutchison (RHP, 2-7, 4.08 ERA, 56 K’s)</p>\n<p>Game 3: Cristian Javier (RHP, 8-9, 3.01 ERA, 165 K’s) vs Joey Wentz (LHP, 1-1, 4.05 ERA, 10 K’s)</p>\n\nFor Your Viewing and Listening Pleasure\n<p>Game 1: Monday, September 12th @ 5:40 pm CDTListen: Astros - KBME 790 AM/94.5 FM HD-2, KTRH 740 AM/99.1 FM HD-2, TUDN 93.3/KLAT 1010 / Tigers - WXYT 97.1 FMWatch: Astros - ATT SportsNet-SW / Tigers - Bally Sports Detroit / MLB Network (out-of-market only)</p>\n<p>Game 2: Tuesday, September 13th @ 5:40 pm CDTListen: Astros - KBME 790 AM/94.5 FM HD-2, KTRH 740 AM/99.1 FM HD-2, TUDN 93.3/KLAT 1010 / Tigers - WXYT 97.1 FMWatch: Astros - ATT SportsNet-SW / Tigers - Bally Sports Detroit</p>\n<p>Game 3: Wednesday, September 14th @ 12:10 pm CDTListen: Astros - KBME 790 AM/94.5 FM HD-2, KTRH 740 AM/99.1 FM HD-2, TUDN 93.3/KLAT 1010 / Tigers - WXYT 97.1 FMWatch: Astros - ATT SportsNet-SW / Tigers - Bally Sports Detroit / MLB Network (out-of-market only)</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Stephen Green/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Seasons wrap across the minors, while a few top Reds prospects put on a show.</p> Louisville Bats (AAA)\n\nLouisville Bats 7, Columbus Clippers 5 (Friday)\n\nColumbus Clippers 7, Louisville Bats 6 (Saturday)\n\nColumbus Clippers 7, Louisville Bats 5 (Sunday)\n<p>The Bats lost 2 of 3 over the weekend, but who counts wins and losses around these parts, anyway? Friday saw big offensive nights from Juniel Querecuto (2B, dinger), Stephen Piscotty (1B, dinger), and TJ Hopkins (1B, dinger), and that was good enough to back a solid effort by Deck McGuire on the bump (6.0 IP, 2 ER). Ben Lively was rocked steadily again in his start on Saturday (3.0 IP, 3 ER, dinger surrendered), and that set the stage for the Bats to play trailer all day. Both Querecuto and Hopkins socked homers again on Saturday, which was noble of them, while Juniel rolled that homer streak into yet another on in Sunday’s loss, too. TJ only managed a 2-hit game on Sunday, though Piscotty joined back in with a homer again, too. Hunter Greene looked like himself with 3.0 IP of 1 ER ball (4 H, BB, 5 K), but unfortunately, the bullpen down there is the bullpen that is up here, too.</p>\nChattanooga Lookouts (AA)\n\nBirmingham Barons 3, Chattanooga Lookouts 2 (Friday)\n\nBirmingham Barons 5, Chattanooga Lookouts 0 (Saturday)\n\nChattanooga Lookouts 6, Birmingham Barons 5 (Sunday)\n<p>The Lookouts squeaked out a Sunday victory to salvage what had otherwise been a difficult weekend (as part of a larger difficult end to their season). Mike Siani singled, walked, and stole a pair of bags in a Friday effort that also saw Allan Cerda double and drive in a pair of runs as part of his 2-hit evening. Eduardo Salazar put up a stellar 7.0 IP of 5 H, 2 BB, 8 K ball in that one, yielding just a pair of runs. Connor Phillips was the hard-luck loser on Saturday despite allowing just a lone ER in 5.1 IP, but the offense couldn’t so much as muster an XBH on the day - for those wondering, Elly De La Cruz did chip in with a single and a stolen base, at least. The Chatt Bats poked 10 total hits en route to the victory on Sunday, with Elly going HAM with a single, double, 3 steals, a pair of runs scored, and a ribbie to lead the way. Cerda walked, singled, doubled, and scored twice while Brian Rey had a 3-hit day (with a double), all of which served to back Andrew Abbott and his excellent, scoreless 5.0 IP outing of 2 H, 2 BB, 9 K ball.</p>\nDayton Dragons (High-A)\n\nDayton Dragons 8, Lansing Lugnuts 4 (Friday)\n\nLansing Lugnuts 9, Dayton Dragons 5 (Saturday)\n<p>Dayton’s season came to an end this weekend in frustrating fashion, as Sunday’s finale was banged due to rain. Friday saw many fireworks, at least, as the Dragons got homers from each of Rece Hinds, Austin Hendrick, Hayden Jones, Michel Triana, and Jose Torres to fuel the victory. Saturday was more of a struggle, unfortunately, though Hendrick at least finished his late-season tear with another solid outing (1 for 3 with a homer, a steal, and a walk). He hit .255/.377/.543 (.920 OPS) over his final 27 games, with 7 dingers and 28 ribbies  in that span (alongside 17 BB and 30 K). Over a 162 game pace, that’s 48 dingers, 168 ribbies, and 102 walks, said the author while acknowledging he knows full well that’s not how any of this really works.</p>\nDaytona Tortugas (Single-A)\n<p>Unfortunately, rain claimed the entire weekend for the Dragonas, thereby ending their regular season, too. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for following along with us for another season full of Farmers Only, folks.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Manneken Pis, the cheeky statue in the heart of Brussels of a little boy urinating, has brought a smile to the face of countless tourists from around the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just up the road, visitors can enjoy his wardrobe numbering 1,000 outfits spanning several centuries. And now, this modest museum in honor of a boy with a one-track mind will be serving a new cause: mental health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting today, psychiatrists in the Belgian capital will be able to prescribe tours of this museum, among others, to people suffering from mental health issues. Those in the depths of depression or burnout can go even deeper — underground, even — by heading to the Sewer Museum, which provides visitors with a unique glimpse into the hidden underbelly of Europe’s capital and will also be part of the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Now’s the time to do this,” said Delphine Houba, Brussels’ alderwoman for culture, who is spearheading the initiative. “The coronavirus reminded us that culture is essential for mental health,” she told POLITICO in an interview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to an in-depth review of the evidence by the World Health Organization, the arts can play a “major role” in the prevention of ill health, the promotion of health, and management and treatment of illness across people’s lifespan. And, in the first project of its kind in Europe, hospitals in Brussels are turning to art and culture to help treat people suffering from stress, depression or burnout. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The arts help all human beings forget we are mortal beings,” said Dr. Vincent Lustygier, a psychiatrist at the Brugmann University Hospital. “During the pandemic, death became something that was waiting outside your door. We saw to what extent mental illness became prevalent afterwards.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Houba was inspired by a Canadian project under which residents of Quebec exhibiting symptoms of mental health issues were prescribed visits to its Museum of Fine Arts. While the Canadian project employed one venue and an association of doctors, the adapted-for-Brussels version will be conducted with the participation of Brugmann psychiatrists and the five cultural venues under the city’s direct jurisdiction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You know, Brussels is a bit complicated,” she explained, noting that the initiative will start small and last for six months, after which an evaluation will determine whether the project can be extended to include venues such as the Royal Museum or the Bozar modern art museum, which are under federal jurisdiction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the City Museum, the Fashion and Lace Museum will also be participating, along with the Manneken Pis Wardrobe, where visitors can “take a tour around the world” through the wardrobe of Brussels’ infamous mascot. Topping off the list will be the CENTRALE contemporary art center and, lastly, the Sewer Museum, which provides visitors with a unique glimpse into the hidden underground world of Europe’s capital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked how the Sewer Museum could help patients with depression, Lustygier, the psychiatrist, had a simple answer: “Why not try? We are going to test it and see.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turning to the works of art at the City Museum, where the initiative was launched Monday, Lustygier pointed to a 18th-century picture of Brussels residents strolling through the city. “Look at them,” he said. “They existed centuries ago, but they are not dead. Through the arts, we laugh at death.”</p>",

        "description": "<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>As the first midterm election season since Donald Trump’s 2020 effort to steal an election passes through, many citizens are getting swept up in the storm. Election officials are being harassed for doing their jobs; election deniers in purple states are gaining momentum in their quests to D.C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A unique situation is rising in Florida: Four years after an overwhelming majority of Floridians chose via ballot measure to restore the right to vote for formerly incarcerated citizens, the state is arresting them for doing just that. But why?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are five points on what to know about the developing situation.</p>\n\n\n\nA pre-Civil War law in Florida used to bar former felons from voting for life.\n\n\n\n<p>Since 1845, Florida’s constitution included a statute barring any person “who shall hereafter be convicted of bribery, perjury, or other infamous crime” from voting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 2008 report by the Florida Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights linked this statute to the state’s ongoing attempts to suppress Black votes after the Civil War.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“After the war, the First Reconstruction Act of 1867 mandated that to re-enter the Union, former Confederate states had to adopt new constitutions guaranteeing male suffrage without regard to race,” the report states. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Florida was among several Southern states that explicitly barred Black people from voting, freedmen or not. When the Confederates lost the war, the state adopted an array of barriers to voting in order to comply with the First Reconstruction Act while upholding race discrimination, including literacy tests, poll taxes, property qualifications, and felon disenfranchisement laws, among others.</p>\n\n\n\nThe measure was lifted with a historic ballot initiative in 2018.\n\n\n\n<p>Florida activists had a similar understanding of the state’s disenfranchisement laws. Led by the nonpartisan activist group the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, organizers pushed Amendment 4, the Voting Rights Restoration for Felons Initiative, on the ballot to rescind the centuries-old ban.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It worked: On November 6, 2018, Floridians passed Amendment 4, also known as the Voting Rights Restoration for Felons Initiative, by a healthy margin — 64.55% of the vote — reinstating suffrage for over 1.4 million formerly incarcerated residents across the state. (The amendment excluded those convicted of murder or sexual crimes.) </p>\n\n\n\nFlorida Republicans rolled back the amendment’s scope.\n\n\n\n<p>The Florida GOP wasn’t too happy about the outcome of the Amendment 4 vote: Less than a year later, Governor Ron DeSantis signed Florida Senate Bill 7066 (SB 7066) into law, which required that newly enfranchised felons repay all fines and fees owed before they can gain the right to vote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill was tried in federal district court, where Judge Robert Hinkle ruled on May 24, 2020, that the state could only prohibit felons from voting if they can afford to pay their outstanding fines and fees, decrying the bill as a “pay-to-vote” system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A state may disenfranchise felons and impose conditions on their reenfranchisement,” he wrote. “But the conditions must pass constitutional scrutiny. Whatever might be said of a rationally constructed stem, this one falls short in substantial respects.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the federal judge’s ruling was blocked by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals on July 2, 2020; that September, the appellate court ruled in favor of the state, allowing SB 7066 to pass without restrictions.</p>\n\n\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis launched an office to prosecute illegal voting—but mostly targets former felons.\n\n\n\n<p>The Republican governor has since doubled-down on his efforts to curb felon voting. This summer he launched a new division within Florida’s Department of State: the Office of Election Crimes and Security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He announced on August 18, 2022, that 20 Florida residents in Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties had all been arrested for voter fraud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They did not go through any process, they did not get their rights restored, and yet they went ahead and voted anyways,” he told reporters. “That is against the law and now they’re going to pay the price for it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But numerous media reports have found that the arrestees didn’t know that they weren’t allowed to vote. Most of those arrested had, in fact, been encouraged to vote through registration drives and government officials. In several cases, the state only rescinded their right to vote after they’d legally registered to do so.</p>\n\n\n\nDeSantis’ administration shrugs off blame for creating this situation.\n\n\n\n<p>So, who’s fault is it? Governor DeSantis has claimed that counties are responsible for notifying applicants as to whether they’re eligible to vote, but former Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee told ProPublica/Times-Herald that the law places that responsibility on the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Florida Department of State has a duty under section 98.075(5), Fla. Stat. to identify those registered voters who have been convicted of a felony and whose voting rights have not been restored,” she told them in an email. “The law requires the department to review information from a number of sources and make an initial determination as to whether the information is credible and reliable.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of those swept up in the prosecutions are challenging the charges. Romona Oliver, a 55-year-old Tampa Bay resident who’d recently served 20 years in prison, was among those swept up in the raids. She’d registered to vote in early 2020. When a rep at the Hillsborough Tax Collector’s office asked whether she had a felony conviction, she said yes; the county official didn’t know that her arrest was for second-degree murder, however, and helped her fill out her registration form, Oliver told the Tampa Bay Times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voting for the first time in 2020 wound up the act that sent her back to jail. When police came to her door, according to the Tampa Bay Times, she wasn’t sure what she did. “I ain’t done nothing but go to work and come home,” she reportedly said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Correction: The 2018 measure reenfranchising felons was a ballot measure to amend the state constitution, not a bill.</p>",

He’s even more productive than usual against fellow lefties like Trevor Rogers and Braxton Garrett (.354/.399/.592, 9 HR in 158 PA).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Marlins Game Notes</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Marlins Game 1 Starting Lineup</p>\n\nLF Jon Berti (102 wRC+ this season, 65 wRC+ over last 30 days)\n3B Brian Anderson (97, 60)\nDH Garrett Cooper (112, 77)\nCF JJ Bleday (88, 75)\n2B Charles Leblanc (114, 67)\nSS Miguel Rojas (73, 51) \nC Jacob Stallings (69, 103) \nRF Jerar Encarnación (49, 47)\n1B Lewin Díaz (39, 47) \n\n<p>LHP Trevor Rogers (75 ERA+ this season, career 103 ERA+) </p>\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n      Rogers’ 2022 pitch distribution and Statcast percentile rankings\n  \n<p></p>\n<p>Lineup Changes from Previous Game: Encarnación and Fortes in, Avisaíl García and Jacob Stallings out; Berti switches form 2B to LF, Anderson switches from RF to 3B, Encarnación switches from LF to RF</p>\n<p>Additional Notes: After beginning his big league career as Miami’s primary third baseman, Leblanc now has more defensive innings at second than he does at third...Swing-and-miss has become an issue for Encarnación. He has struck out in half of his September plate appearances and more than 40% overall as a major leaguer. His swinging strike rate is the worst in MLB (min. 50 PA)...Braxton Garrett is expected to make his return from an oblique injury as tonight’s starting pitcher.</p>\n\nHow to Watch/Listen/Follow\n<p>First pitch of the first game is scheduled for 1:10 p.m. ET, with the second game starting at 7:10 p.m. Watch on Bally Sports Florida or listen to the radio broadcast on Fox Sports 940 Miami.

        "description": "<p>Francis Fukuyama: “If the Ukrainians don’t simply hold out against Russia but actually defeat Russia’s massive army and force it to retreat, the positive reverberations will be felt across the globe. Populist nationalists around the world, from Viktor Orbán to Matteo Salvini to Marine Le Pen to Donald Trump, have expressed admiration for Putin’s style of strongman rule. A Russian defeat and humiliation will puncture this narrative of the advantages of authoritarian government, and might lead to a rekindling of democratic self-confidence.”</p>\n<p>“It has been easy for publics in Western democracies to take for granted the peace and prosperity brought about by the liberal world order. It may be the case that every generation needs to relearn the lesson that the alternatives to liberal democracy lead to violence, repression, and ultimately economic failure. Such a lesson will be driven home if the world sees brave Ukrainians fighting for their country succeed beyond all expectations.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>Stephen Curry says Americans should treat President Trump — and his potential 2024 White House bid — as a serious “threat.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Take Trump seriously? Of course,” the Golden State Warriors star and NBA Finals MVP told Rolling Stone magazine for a cover story published Monday for its October issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Most of his rhetoric — before he was president, during his last four years, and even now, if he tries to run again — has a tone of divisiveness that doesn’t have a place in our country,\" he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As serious and as loud as the threat is of him or whoever else is running for office,” Curry, 34, continued, “there’s a similar urgency and a loudness that’s necessary on the other side.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not the first time that Curry has spoken out against the 45th president. After Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank called the then-commander in chief an “asset” to the country in a 2017 interview, Curry told the San Jose Mercury News, “I agree with that description, if you remove the ‘et’ from asset.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That same year, Curry said he didn’t want his team to make a traditional stop at the White House to celebrate their NBA championship title. Following Curry’s remarks, Trump tweeted that the White House invitation had been “withdrawn.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curry, a board member of When We All Vote, Michelle Obama’s voter registration and engagement organization, opened up about his activism to Rolling Stone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You’re growing and evolving on the same page as these national, politicized conversations, but it doesn’t have to be sides,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What I try to do is be real, but also activate conversation that is sometimes uncomfortable,” the NBA All-Star said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The current events of the Trump era, I don’t wake up and say, ‘I wanna go at that conversation,’” Curry told the magazine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Some of this stuff falls on your doorstep and people want a perspective or comment, and sometimes you cough that up unsolicited.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curry said that while he didn’t regret not speaking out more in 2016 when the NBA weighed moving its All-Star game from North Carolina in protest of a controversial law requiring that transgender people use the bathroom corresponding to their biological sex, he could’ve “been a lot stronger” on the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We get attacked as athletes sometimes when you don’t want to say something — ‘I need to get more educated,’ there’s all these lines that people use,” Curry said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It kind of seems like you’re soft or like you’re equivocating or avoiding whatever the situation is.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curry also revealed that former President Obama — a frequent golfing partner and well-known basketball fanatic — once scolded him for repeating on a 2018 podcast a conspiracy theory that questioned whether astronauts really landed on the moon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the podcast interview, Curry recalled, “I got an email. It was a pretty stern, direct one from President Obama.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After telling him that humans did step foot on the moon, Curry said Obama instructed him, “You’ve got to do something about this.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following Obama’s advice, Curry hosted an Instagram Live discussion with an astronaut for his more than 45 million followers, and auctioned off a pair of custom-made space-themed sneakers, with proceeds going to STEM education programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curry said back in June, after clenching his fourth NBA championship and telling the cameras, “What are they gonna say now?” he received a congratulatory call from Obama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ex-president suggested tweaking the boast slightly, telling Curry, “What the f--- are they gonna say now?”</p>",

        "description": "<p>As many as 15,000 Minnesota nurses went on strike Monday, citing short staffing and low wage increases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thousands-strong strike may be the largest private-sector nurses’ strike in the nation’s history, according to a release from the Minnesota Nurses’ Association (MNA).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nurses at 16 hospitals in Minnesota’s Twin Cities and elsewhere in the state rallied Sunday night and began the three-day strike Monday morning after months of contract negotiations with hospital executives, the union said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Minnesota nurses are demanding safer working conditions, better nurse retention and safer staffing systems, according to National Nurses United.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Corporate healthcare policies in our hospitals have left nurses understaffed and overworked, while patients are overcharged, local hospitals and services are closed, and executives take home million-dollar paychecks,” said MNA’s First Vice President Chris Rubesch in a statement from the union. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The union says hospital executives have seen huge raises to their own salaries, but have offered nurses a 4 percent average annual increase, “well below the current rate of inflation and climbing cost of living.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Minnesota’s Star Tribune, the nurses asked for nearly 30 percent pay raises over three years, and hospitals offered around 10 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research shows patient care is adversely impacted by health care worker strikes — and the affected hospitals began planning to train temp nurses to deal with the fallout of the 15,000 strikers leaving bedsides to protest, according to the Star Tribune. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A National Nurses United poll earlier this year found nurses, two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, concerned about staffing issues and an uptick in workplace violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly 70 percent of nurses said staffing shortages have worsened since earlier in the pandemic, and over a quarter of nurses said they had been assigned to work with a skillset they did not possess. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As nurses leave the front lines, a new analysis indicates the U.S. could experience a labor gap of as many as 450,000 nurses by 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A McKinsey &amp; Company report released in February found 32 percent of surveyed U.S. registered nurses said they may leave direct patient care, citing staffing and pay issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Biden has long acknowledged the impact of the pandemic on those in the health care profession, and nurses have asked the White House to take action on the ongoing pandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent remarks at a Labor Day event in Pennsylvania, Biden touted his administration's work on the American Rescue Plan as it relates to health care workers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Here in the state of Pennsylvania, and almost every state, didn’t have enough money to keep teachers on the payroll, to keep firefighters on the job, to keep police on the job, to keep people, nurses and docs on the job,\" Biden said. “And so what’d we do? We, in fact, gave them the money to make sure they did it.\"</p>",

        "description": "<p>Scientists have identified a protein, sulfatase-2, that plays a critical role in the damage rheumatoid arthritis causes.</p>\n<p>Rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic disease in which the immune system attacks the body’s own joint tissues, affects an estimated 1.5 million Americans.</p>\n<p>Published in the journal Cellular &amp; Molecular Immunology, the discovery sheds new light on the molecular processes that drive inflammation seen in rheumatoid arthritis. It could also someday lead to improved treatment of the disease, which currently has no cure.</p>\n<p>“Tumor necrosis factor alpha—or TNF alpha for short—is one of the main inflammatory proteins that drive rheumatoid arthritis and is targeted by many currently available therapies,” says senior author Salah Uddin Ahmed, a professor in Washington State University’s College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.</p>\n<p>“However, over time patients can develop a resistance to these drugs, meaning they no longer work for them. That is why we were looking for previously undiscovered drug targets in TNF alpha signaling, so basically proteins that it interacts with that may play a role.”</p>\n<p>Though sulfatases such as sulfatase-2 have been extensively studied for their roles in different types of cancer, Ahmed says no one had looked at how they might be involved in inflammatory or autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.</p>\n<p>The research team first explored this idea using cells called synovial fibroblasts, which line the joints and keep them lubricated to ensure fluid movement.</p>\n<p>“In rheumatoid arthritis, these normally quiescent cells get activated by TNF alpha and other inflammatory molecules, and they take on this aggressive character,” says first author Ruby J. Siegel, a PhD graduate in the College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.</p>\n<p>“They are not dying when they should, and they proliferate in a way that is almost tumor-like, forming this massive synovial tissue that should not be anywhere near that size and at the same time activating proteins that destroy cartilage and bone.”</p>\n<p>Using the joint-lining cells of rheumatoid arthritis patients, they removed sulfatase-2 from one group of cells before stimulating all cells with the inflammatory TNF alpha. They found that cells lacking sulfatase-2 did not show the same exaggerated inflammatory response to TNF alpha as cells that were left intact.</p>\n<p>“Looking at sulfatases for their potential role in inflammation was an educated guess, but once we did we saw a very consistent pattern of increased sulfatase-2 expression throughout different tissues and samples we studied,” Ahmed says. “This tells us that TNF alpha relies on sulfatase-2 to drive inflammation, because as soon as we removed sulfatase-2 the inflammatory effects of TNF alpha were markedly reduced.”</p>\n<p>Resulting from a series of experiments spanning four years, the researchers’ findings open the door to future animal studies to test the effectiveness of inhibiting sulfatase-2 to ease rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.</p>\n<p>This could someday lead to the development of new combination therapies that along with other inflammatory proteins would also target sulfatase-2 to prevent bone loss, cartilage damage, and deformed joints. Such therapies could help address the shortcomings of currently available rheumatoid arthritis drugs, many of which come with significant side effects.</p>\n<p>“These drugs shut off TNF alpha in your whole body, but it does have important immune functions,” Siegel says. Patients who take these types of drugs are more susceptible to infection and have an increased risk of developing cancer with long-term use. She also notes that TNF alpha inhibitors are not effective in all people and are not recommended for patients with certain other health conditions.</p>\n<p>The National Institutes of Health and the Rheumatology Research Foundation funded the work.</p>\n<p>Source: Washington State University</p>\n<p>The post Team IDs protein behind rheumatoid arthritis damage appeared first on Futurity.</p>",

        "description": "<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>As the first midterm election season since Donald Trump’s 2020 effort to steal an election passes through, many citizens are getting swept up in the storm. Election officials are being harassed for doing their jobs; election deniers in purple states are gaining momentum in their quests to D.C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A unique situation is rising in Florida: Four years after an overwhelming majority of Floridians chose via ballot measure to restore the right to vote for formerly incarcerated citizens, the state is arresting them for doing just that. But why?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are five points on what to know about the developing situation.</p>\n\n\n\nA pre-Civil War law in Florida used to bar former felons from voting for life.\n\n\n\n<p>Since 1845, Florida’s constitution included a statute barring any person “who shall hereafter be convicted of bribery, perjury, or other infamous crime” from voting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 2008 report by the Florida Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights linked this statute to the state’s ongoing attempts to suppress Black votes after the Civil War.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“After the war, the First Reconstruction Act of 1867 mandated that to re-enter the Union, former Confederate states had to adopt new constitutions guaranteeing male suffrage without regard to race,” the report states. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Florida was among several Southern states that explicitly barred Black people from voting, freedmen or not. When the Confederates lost the war, the state adopted an array of barriers to voting in order to comply with the First Reconstruction Act while upholding race discrimination, including literacy tests, poll taxes, property qualifications, and felon disenfranchisement laws, among others.</p>\n\n\n\nThe measure was lifted with a historic ballot initiative in 2018.\n\n\n\n<p>Florida activists had a similar understanding of the state’s disenfranchisement laws. Led by the nonpartisan activist group the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, organizers pushed Amendment 4, the Voting Rights Restoration for Felons Initiative, on the ballot to rescind the centuries-old ban.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It worked: On November 6, 2018, Floridians passed Amendment 4, also known as the Voting Rights Restoration for Felons Initiative, by a healthy margin — 64.55% of the vote — reinstating suffrage for over 1.4 million formerly incarcerated residents across the state. (The amendment excluded those convicted of murder or sexual crimes.) </p>\n\n\n\nFlorida Republicans rolled back the amendment’s scope.\n\n\n\n<p>The Florida GOP wasn’t too happy about the outcome of the Amendment 4 vote: Less than a year later, Governor Ron DeSantis signed Florida Senate Bill 7066 (SB 7066) into law, which required that newly enfranchised felons repay all fines and fees owed before they can gain the right to vote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill was tried in federal district court, where Judge Robert Hinkle ruled on May 24, 2020, that the state could only prohibit felons from voting if they can afford to pay their outstanding fines and fees, decrying the bill as a “pay-to-vote” system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A state may disenfranchise felons and impose conditions on their reenfranchisement,” he wrote. “But the conditions must pass constitutional scrutiny. Whatever might be said of a rationally constructed stem, this one falls short in substantial respects.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the federal judge’s ruling was blocked by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals on July 2, 2020; that September, the appellate court ruled in favor of the state, allowing SB 7066 to pass without restrictions.</p>\n\n\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis launched an office to prosecute illegal voting—but mostly targets former felons.\n\n\n\n<p>The Republican governor has since doubled-down on his efforts to curb felon voting. This summer he launched a new division within Florida’s Department of State: the Office of Election Crimes and Security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He announced on August 18, 2022, that 20 Florida residents in Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties had all been arrested for voter fraud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They did not go through any process, they did not get their rights restored, and yet they went ahead and voted anyways,” he told reporters. “That is against the law and now they’re going to pay the price for it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But numerous media reports have found that the arrestees didn’t know that they weren’t allowed to vote. Most of those arrested had, in fact, been encouraged to vote through registration drives and government officials. In several cases, the state only rescinded their right to vote after they’d legally registered to do so.</p>\n\n\n\nDeSantis’ administration shrugs off blame for creating this situation.\n\n\n\n<p>So, who’s fault is it? Governor DeSantis has claimed that counties are responsible for notifying applicants as to whether they’re eligible to vote, but former Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee told ProPublica/Times-Herald that the law places that responsibility on the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Florida Department of State has a duty under section 98.075(5), Fla. Stat. to identify those registered voters who have been convicted of a felony and whose voting rights have not been restored,” she told them in an email. “The law requires the department to review information from a number of sources and make an initial determination as to whether the information is credible and reliable.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of those swept up in the prosecutions are challenging the charges. Romona Oliver, a 55-year-old Tampa Bay resident who’d recently served 20 years in prison, was among those swept up in the raids. She’d registered to vote in early 2020. When a rep at the Hillsborough Tax Collector’s office asked whether she had a felony conviction, she said yes; the county official didn’t know that her arrest was for second-degree murder, however, and helped her fill out her registration form, Oliver told the Tampa Bay Times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voting for the first time in 2020 wound up the act that sent her back to jail. When police came to her door, according to the Tampa Bay Times, she wasn’t sure what she did. “I ain’t done nothing but go to work and come home,” she reportedly said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Correction: The 2018 measure reenfranchising felons was a ballot measure to amend the state constitution, not a bill.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Jason Miller/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Taking the handedness of their opposing pitchers into account and who they will be sending to the mound, this three-game series against the Angels may sneakily be an issue for the Guardians. Cleveland will turn to rookies in the first two games and Cal Quantrill in the finale on Wednesday. </p>\n<p>Quantrill is nails, and Cody Morris has looked solid in one of his two starts (note: Konnor Pilkington has been omitted from this compliment intermission, but he is also pitching), so why the concern for the Guardians then? Well, the Angels pitchers have trouble finding scissors in a pinch, you see. In the Middle Ages they might have been accused of witchcraft. </p>\n<p>They’re left-handed. </p>\n<p>Cleveland bats can absolutely sing against right-handers — it’s a big reason they’ve opened a gap in the AL Central — but lefties are another story. Heading into the series they have a wOBA of just .279 off southpaws, good for 29th in all of baseball where they enjoy the company of some elite offenses such as the Miami Marlins, Oakland Athletics, and Pittsburgh Pirates. It’s not a pretty place at the bottom of the wOBA-against-left-handed-pitchers list, but it’s currently where Cleveland calls home. </p>\n<p>As unwatchable as the Angels have been every second Mike Trout or Shohei Ohtani are not on screen, their pitching hasn’t been completely terrible. Ohtani is the best, of course, but the Guardians will luckily avoid him. Right behind him is Wednesday’s starter, Patrick Sandoval, with a 2.98 ERA in 127 innings. Since he throws left-handed, you can probably knock a run or so off that when he faces the Guards. </p>\n<p>Sandoval, pitching in his fourth major-league season, features a curveball with a wicked spin rate, but it’s hardly his most dangerous pitch. His changeup has gradually become his putaway pitch as he’s gotten better as opponents whiff on it 45.8% of the time in 2022. </p>\n<p>Monday night’s starter, Reid Detmers, is similarly not-terrible with a 3.67 ERA in his 108 innings, but he doesn’t have the advanced measurements to back up his impressive season. He appears to be a middle-of-the-road pitcher having a decent season. But, again, he throws left-handed so for all I know he might throw a no-hitter. </p>\n<p>To avoid such a fate, the Guardians will need their offense to be more like they were against the Twins, and less like they were for the two weeks before it. They’ll need Oscar Gonzalez, owner of four doubles and two home runs in the last week, to stay hot. They’ll need Andrés Giménez to keep playing like he has eyes on a future MVP. They’ll need José Ramírez to start hitting for power again. </p>\n<p>Scoreboard watching will be in full effect for this series, especially if the Guardians overcome their lefty aversion and beat the Angels like they should. Their AL Central lead currently stands at 2.5 games over the White Sox, who start a two-game series against the Rockies tomorrow. The Twins, 4.5 games back and fresh off of getting swept by the Guardians, play the Royals for three before rematching with Cleveland. </p>\nTeam at a glance\n\n\nRecord: 61-79 (11th in AL)\n\nRuns Scored: 537 (13th in AL)\n\nRun Differential: -51 (12th in AL)\n\nLast 10: 5-5\n\nSlash: .229/.294/.386\n\nwOBA: .297 (13th in AL)\n\nwRC+: 91 (13th in AL)\n\nERA: 3.85 (6th in AL)\n\nSIERA: 3.98 (10th in AL)\n\nK-BB%: 13.6% (9th in AL)\n\nProjected starters\n<p>Monday, Sept. 12, 6:10 p.m. ET: LHP Reid Detmers vs. RHP Konnor PilkingtonTuesday, Sept. 13, 6:10 p.m. ET: LHP Jose Suarez vs. RHP Cody MorrisWednesday, Sept. 14, 1:10 p.m. ET: LHP Patrick Sandoval vs. TBD (Cal Quantrill*)</p>\n*pitching prediction via FanGraphs’ Roster Resource\nRoster\n\n40-man roster\nDepth chart",

        "description": "Kamil Krzaczynski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>The Cubs lose 4-2 despite a decent start from Wade Miley</p> <p>The Cubs’ loss on Sunday drops them to a season low 24 games under .500. That’s the story, really. After a nice run of games coming out of the All-Star break, this team was showing signs of what it maybe could be. But, ultimately, a lack of healthy, major league quality pitching combined with a lack of elite offensive talent has combined to sink this team to a new low. </p>\n<p>Both problems were on display Sunday night. The Cubs managed just two runs despite 12 hits. Incredibly, the Cubs did get four hits out of their leadoff hitter. If someone can explain to me why this team so frequently leads off a hitter with a sub .600 OPS, I’m all ears. I’ll repeat that, Zach McKinstry had a-four hit game. He’s only gone over the 100 plate appearance mark for the year, combined between the Cubs and Dodgers, in the last few days. Four hits raised his season OPS to .582. Among those four hits was a double and a triple. Prior to the game, he had a .499 OPS and hadn’t had a hit since August 31. In the interim, he was 0-for-15 with three walks and a sacrifice bunt. Zach should never bat anywhere but ninth when he plays until he earns more than that.</p>\n<p>Wade Miley had a good start. He was up to five innings and he allowed only a single run. Wade wouldn’t have been enough to change the outcome of this season, but he sure would have improved it. He does not appear to be finished. I don’t know if he’d want to stay around here for another year, but I certainly wouldn’t be opposed to the Cubs making him a reasonable offer. </p>\n<p>As they did five days earlier, the Cubs paired Miley with rookie Hayden Wesneski. The first time worked brilliantly. The second time, not so much. Hayden recorded 11 outs. But along the way he allowed four hits and a walk. Two of the hits were home runs and that led to three runs. I remain excited about this addition. I have no doubt that Hayden will arrive for good at some point in 2023, be it opening day or some time later in the season. I also am not surprised that there were some growing pains. One of the marks of every good pitcher is how they grow and learn from the struggles. There are always struggles. </p>\n<p>I’ve spoiled myself on the three positives as we’ve already covered two of them. </p>\n\nZach McKinstry had a four-hit game that included a double and a triple. He scored once. I’m frustrated with the way the Cubs used Zach but that does not mean a four-hit game shouldn’t be the top spot here. Also, when your leadoff man has four hits and seven total bases, you should score more than two runs. My biggest problem beyond the way the Cubs use him is that the infield picture for the Cubs is quite crowded. I don’t see where he has a path to regular at bats and if he can be unlocked, I’m not sure that’s going to happen without regular playing time. \nWade Miley faced 19 batters over five innings. He allowed four hits and a walk. Not to in any way be mean to Hayden Wesneski, but the two pitchers each allowed four hits and a walk. Miley’s qualify as scattered (one run allowed) and Wesneski got lit up (three runs allowed). It’s a short walk many times from the top to the bottom. \nWith the offense producing 12 hits, there were a lot of guys I could choose here but I have to go with Nico Hoerner who had two at bats before leaving with an injury and had two hits, one of which was a double. Hopefully the injury is relatively minor and he can get back in there soon. Nico has been the star of this team this year. On a side note, Christopher Morel replaced him in the lineup and had a single and a walk. The shortstop position reached base in all four plate appearances in this one. \n\n<p>Now, let’s turn our attention to the Heroes and Goats and see how WPA scored this one. </p>\n<p>Game 140, September 11: Giants 4 at Cubs 2 (58-82)</p>\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs\n  \n<p>Reminder: Heroes and Goats are determined by WPA scores and are in no way subjective.</p>\n<p>THREE HEROES:</p>\n\n\nSuperhero: Rafael Ortega (.134). 2-3, RBI, SB, DP\n\nHero: Wade Miley (.129). 5IP (19 batters), 4H, BB, R, 5K\n\nSidekick: Christopher Morel (.059). 1-1, BB\n\n<p>THREE GOATS:</p>\n\n\nBilly Goat: Hayden Wesneski (.226). 3⅔ IP (16 batters), 4H, BB, 3R, 3K (L 1-1)\n\nGoat: David Bote (-.197). 1-4, 2K, DP\n\nKid: Ian Happ (-.115). 0-4, K\n\n<p>WPA Play of the Game: Thairo Estrada his a solo homer off of Hayden Wesneski leading off the seventh inning. That gave the Giants a 2-1 lead. (.166)</p>\n<p>*Cubs Play of the Game: Rafael Ortega batted with a runner on second and two outs in the fifth inning, the Cubs trailing by one. He singled and tied the game and also advanced to second on an error. (.160) </p>\n\n<p>Rizzo Award Cumulative Standings: (Top 5/Bottom 5)</p>\n<p>The award is named for Anthony Rizzo, who finished first in this category three of the first four years it was in existence and four times overall. He also recorded the highest season total ever at +65.5. The point scale is three points for a Superhero down to negative three points for a Billy Goat.</p>\n\nDavid Robertson +22.5\nNico Hoerner +17.5\nScott Effross +17\nChristopher Morel +15\nPatrick Wisdom +13.5\nDaniel Norris/Frank Schwindel -9.5\nRowan Wick -10.5\nRafael Ortega -12.5\nYan Gomes -13\nJason Heyward -15.5\n\n<p>Up Next: The Cubs are in New York for three games against the Mets. The Cubs were swept by the Mets in a three game series in July at Wrigley Field. The Mets are 89-52 and are only a 1½ games ahead of the defending World Series champion Braves in the NL East. So this series has quite a lot of importance for them. Javier Assad (0-1, 2.93) starts for the Cubs. The Mets will go with Chris Bassitt (13-7, 3.24).</p>\n<p>Writers Note: As I’ve noted previously, I’m having a surgical procedure today.

        "description": "<p>With every passing day, the negotiations held between the European Commission and Pfizer over the EU’s largest COVID-19 vaccine contract look less like business as usual and more like a whodunnit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plot thickened further after the European Court of Auditors published a report today, accusing the Commission of refusing to disclose any details of Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s personal role in the talks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The budget watchdog found that the EU chief threw out the existing rulebook to hash out a preliminary deal with the U.S. multinational, paving the way for a contract for up to 1.8 billion coronavirus vaccine doses to be signed in May 2021. For all the other vaccine deals struck by the EU between 2020 and 2021, a joint team comprising officials from the Commission and seven member countries conducted exploratory talks. The outcome was then taken to a Vaccine Steering Board made up of representatives from all 27 EU member states who signed off on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this established procedure was not followed in the case of the EU’s biggest contract, the Court of Auditors says. Instead, von der Leyen herself conducted preliminary negotiations for the contract in March, and presented the results to the steering board in April. Meanwhile, a planned meeting of scientific advisors, organized to discuss the EU’s vaccine strategy for 2022, never took place, the court writes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike with the other contract negotiations, the Commission refused to provide records of the discussions with Pfizer, either in the form of minutes, names of experts consulted, agreed terms, or other evidence. “We asked the Commission to provide us with information on the preliminary negotiations for this agreement,” the report’s authors write. “However, none was forthcoming.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A senior auditor who helped lead the investigation told POLITICO that the Commission’s refusal to divulge information was highly unusual. “This comes up almost never. It’s not a situation that we at the court normally face,” said the auditor, who requested anonymity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The audit report raises further concerns about von der Leyen’s actions, just two days before she is due to deliver her annual State of the Union address.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already in April 2021, the New York Times reported that the EU leader had exchanged text messages with Albert Bourla, the chief executive officer of Pfizer, in the run-up to the deal. The seemingly cozy relationship between top political and business leaders raised eyebrows at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as the report notes, the European ombudsman’s investigation into the matter met a wall of silence. At the time, the Commission claimed that it no longer had the text messages on record. In response, ombudsman Emily O’Reilly determined that maladministration had taken place.</p>\n\n\n\nThe biggest deal\n\n\n\n<p>The controversy revolves around the Commission’s third contract for BioNTech/Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine. The previous two contracts had secured a total of up to 600 million doses. But this next one, for up to 1.8 billion doses, would prove to be the largest by far of all the deals signed by Brussels. It foresaw the up-front purchase of 900 million doses, with the option to order 900 million more, for delivery in 2022 and 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The contract was significant both in terms of volume and price. According to leaked details, shots cost €15.50 each, meaning the contract would be worth nearly €30 billion if fully exercised. “It is the biggest COVID-19 vaccine contract signed by the Commission and will dominate the EU’s vaccine portfolio until the end of 2023,” the court notes. Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment for this story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deal came at the height of the pandemic, shortly after production and distribution issues at vaccine maker AstraZeneca had left the EU languishing behind the U.S. and U.K. in the race to procure shots. It was in the midst of this crisis that von der Leyen stepped in. </p>\n\n\n\nThe European Court of Auditors says established procedures were not followed in the case of the EU’s biggest vaccine contract with Pfizer | Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t the first time that the Commission president had gotten in trouble over “disappearing” text messages. During her time as German defense minister, a parliamentary inquiry into well paid deals with external consultants heard that a subordinate had accidentally erased text messages from her official phone and von der Leyen had herself deleted messages from her own device. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, von der Leyen was exonerated in 2020 by the inquiry’s final report, which found that senior military officers and government officials had committed violations. In her own testimony to the inquiry, she admitted shortcomings in the ministry’s handling of the consulting deals but said that she had addressed them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Commission didn’t respond to a request for comment and its written response to the audit report makes no reference to von der Leyen’s interactions with Pfizer. But, appearing recently before the European Parliament’s committee on COVID-19, Sandra Gallina, the senior Commission health official who helped lead the negotiations, challenged the idea that there was anything unusual about the third Pfizer contract. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It was negotiated like all other contracts. I don’t see any difference,” Gallina said, while adding that “there was, perhaps, a different pre-negotiation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The court auditor interviewed by POLITICO said that the preliminary negotiations had been crucial to the final deal terms: “The key aspects of the contracts were agreed informally. It was only upon the conclusion of that informal agreement that the formal process could continue. It was really essential to negotiations.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The court cannot compel the Commission to release the missing information. But the European Parliament, through its budget committee, can express its displeasure over the matter.</p>\n\n\n\nFace the music\n\n\n\n<p>Next month, Pfizer’s Bourla is scheduled to appear before Parliament’s COVID panel. The committee’s chair, Belgian Socialist MEP Kathleen van Brempt, said she also intends to ask the court to present its findings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking to POLITICO, van Brempt said that she understood that, after the AstraZeneca setback in early 2021, the Commission was under immense pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We were therefore depending on Pfizer, who had managed to advance some of its deliveries to the EU. I understand that in these circumstances, it was important for Ms. von der Leyen to engage with Mr. Bourla directly,” the MEP said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, she noted that the Commission President had sidelined the joint negotiating teams for a deal that would only deliver doses the following year, after most Europeans were already vaccinated. The size of the order would later prove to be an issue, with Eastern European countries complaining earlier this year of being locked in to buying too many doses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of transparency, moreover, adds further fuel to the perception that the EU is distant and in the pocket of multinationals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Just look at the picture: you have a Commission President who personally makes a deal with a Big Pharma CEO and who then later refuses to disclose the texts leading up to that negotiation,” said van Brempt. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One question on the minds of MEPs who’ve been clamoring for increased transparency around the vaccine negotiations is whether vaccine makers exerted any pressure on politicians to block calls to widen access to the intellectual property needed to make vaccines to poorer countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked by left-wing Portuguese MEP Marisa Matias during the COVID committee if Sanofi ever refused any clause on sharing intellectual property rights related to COVID-19 vaccines or other measures that would have made the vaccine a “global public good,” Thomas Triomphe, executive vice president at the French pharmaceutical company, said he didn’t recall that happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Triomphe said that this discussion would need to happen in terms of future contracts. It’s an important issue for the Parliament, which voted in favor of an intellectual property rights waiver, while the Commission remained opposed to the measure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ashleigh Furlong contributed reporting. </p>",

        "description": "Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>The Dodgers’ blowout win on Sunday was thought to have clinched a playoff berth for a 10th consecutive season, but instead just put them one step closer, thanks to potential tiebreakers.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s win pushed the Dodgers to 96 wins on the season, with 23 games left to play. Various records are in play for Los Angeles, with franchise marks the most likely to be toppled, and an MLB record at least possible.</p>\nBest Dodgers record\n<p>106 wins is the most any Dodgers team victories in any one season, and if that number looks familiar, it’s because Los Angeles won that many in both 2019 and 2021. This year, the Dodgers are 53 games over .500 through Sunday, and only need to finish 11-12 to set a new franchise record for wins.</p>\n<p>Going by winning percentage, the 2022 Dodgers currently stand at 96-43 (.691), which would be the highest in team history over a full season. In the 60-game 2020 season, the Dodgers were 43-17 (.717).</p>\n<p>The top two Dodgers records over a full season are by a pair of Brooklyn teams. The 1899 Superbas were 101-47 (.6824) and the 1953 Dodgers were 105-49 (.6818). To top those win percentages, LA this year needs 111 wins, which would require a 15-8 finish.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers this year are on pace to win 112 games.</p>\nMost MLB wins in a season\n<p>If the Dodgers do even better than 15-8 down the stretch, they have an outside chance at reaching the major league record for wins. The 1906 Cubs and 2001 Mariners both won 116 games.</p>\n<p>To match those juggernauts, the Dodgers would need to finish the year 20-3. That would match the best 23-game stretch by any major league team in 2022, accomplished by the Dodgers, Mariners, and Yankees.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3638807-when-not-if-should-the-electoral-college-be-eliminated/",
        "description": "<p>A recent Pew Research Center poll reported that 63 percent of U.S. adults supported doing away with the Electoral College system and relying on popular vote to determine who wins the presidency. That sounds like a strong reason to do so. Yet, in today’s politically divided environment, this is not the right time to change the Constitution and end the Electoral College system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been just four two-candidate presidential elections in U.S. history where the winner in the Electoral College did not also win the popular vote: Rutherford Hayes in 1876, Benjamin Harrison in 1888, George W. Bush in 2000, and most recently, Donald Trump in 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, in most elections, the two measures have been remarkably consistent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is likely that in 2024, if the Republican candidate wins the presidency, they will also lose the popular vote. This is a function of how voters and their political leanings are distributed across the country. This distribution has made the Electoral College a gerrymander of the nation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Founding Fathers who created the Electoral College did not intend it to be so. They established it as a compromise between electing the president by popular vote of the people and a vote by Congress. It also over-weights less populous states, with two electors added for each state’s senators (independent of population) and one elector added for each congressional seat (proportional to population). This now favors Republicans, whose support in less populous Midwest states get amplified. Indeed, the gerrymander is a byproduct of political leanings that have bifurcated voters based on where they choose to live: roughly between urban or rural areas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the Electoral College is a gerrymander, then a different result from the popular vote may occur when the election is highly competitive. In a nation that values democratic principles, should this provide ample reason to end the gerrymander and focus solely on the popular vote? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not exactly. The Electoral College is indeed a gerrymander. However, it is not a gerrymander by politicians, something that is common when state legislators map congressional districts. It is a gerrymander by the voters themselves. Moreover, this gerrymander was done unwittingly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state of California is a poster child for this phenomenon. With a population of just over 39 million people and 54 Electoral College votes up for grabs in 2024, the current politics of the state gives all these votes to the Democrat candidate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 2020 election, President Biden won 63.5 percent of the vote in California, to 34.2 percent for former President Donald Trump, resulting in over 5 million more votes for Biden compared to Trump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the entire country, Biden had more than 7 million more votes than Trump, with over 70 percent of this vote surplus provided solely by Californians. Therefore, by California being a populous state with a high concentration of Democrat voters, these voters have effectively packed themselves to their own detriment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two other large Democratic leaning states are New York and Illinois, where Biden won a total of 3 million more votes than Trump. These three states covered the entire national popular vote surplus for Biden. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, Trump won two large states, Texas and Florida, by a total of just 1 million votes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phenomenon of winning some entities (in this case, states) by a small margin and losing other entities by a large margin illustrates the effect of packing and cracking, the tools of gerrymandering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Biden defeated Trump 306 to 232 in the Electoral College, several states, including Georgia and Arizona, that were close, could have swung the Electoral College. These states have also been the target of voter fraud accusations, although no evidence has been found that any such activities would have changed the election results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democrats may argue that the Electoral College is antiquated and should be discarded in favor of the popular vote. Yet, the Electoral College gerrymander was created by Democrat voters themselves, in where they choose to live — and vote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the divisiveness in our country and the polarization of the population, discarding the Electoral College at this time would fuel further division. It would be viewed by Republicans as highly partisan, with Democrats gaining an advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ideal time to make such a change is after the country has had several elections with the Electoral College and the popular vote providing consistent outcomes, for both Democrat and Republican winners. When that will occur is anyone’s guess. Based on the current state of affairs, this may take some time.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be good reasons to end the Electoral College system, based on popular opinion. There are also good times to do so. Now is not such a time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sheldon H. Jacobson, Ph.D., is a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

        "description": "<p>Nearly 50 million people were living in some form of modern slavery last year, either through forced labor or a forced marriage, an increase of 10 million more people from 2016, according to the United Nations's International Labour Organization (ILO) and International Organization for Migration (IOM).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United Nations published the study this month with anti-slavery organization Walk Free, finding that close to 28 million people were in forced labor in 2021 and nearly 22 million were in a forced marriage, which translates to about 1 in every 150 people worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.N. estimates the percentage has increased in part because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated economic and social issues and expanded opportunities for exploitation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ILO Director-General Guy Ryder said in a statement Monday that it was \"shocking that the situation of modern slavery is not improving.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Nothing can justify the persistence of this fundamental abuse of human rights,” Ryder said, calling on trade unions, employer organizations and society at large to tackle the issue. \"We know what needs to be done, and we know it can be done. Effective national policies and regulation are fundamental.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"But governments cannot do this alone. International standards provide a sound basis, and an all-hands-on-deck approach is needed,\" Ryder added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of people in forced labor increased by 2.7 million people from 2016 to 2021. About one-third of all people in forced labor engage in trade, transport or hospitality sectors, and are coerced into slavery because wages are held back, they must repay debt or are threatened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the 28 million in forced labor, 3.3 million are children and more than half of those children are being sexually exploited, according to the UN report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asian and Pacific nations (excluding central Asia) make up the highest portion of forced labor, with more than 15 million individuals in those countries in a form of modern slavery, according to the UN.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 22 million victims in a forced marriage marks a 6.6 million increase from 2016. That figure includes 14.9 million girls and women, half of whom were coerced into the marriage by verbal or physical abuse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The region with the most forced marriages also includes Asian and Pacific nations, with more than 14 million tied to a form of modern slavery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Arab countries in the Middle East and certain regions of Africa make up the highest percentage per capita, with 10 percent of the region's population in a forced marriage, according to the UN.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anti-slavery organization Walk Free previously published a 2018 report that showed North Korea, Libya and Iran rank among the countries with the most pressing modern slavery problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grace Forrest, the founding director of Walk Free, said on Monday that modern slavery \"continues to underpin our global economy.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"It is a man-made problem, connected to both historical slavery and persisting structural inequality,\" Forrest said in a statement. \"In a time of compounding crises, genuine political will is the key to ending these human rights abuses.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of modern slavery revolves around migration and the exploitation of migrant workers. Migration is likely to increase as climate change creates profound crises across the world and drives refugees to new countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.N. report found that 15 percent of all people in forced labor are migrants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IOM Director-General António Vitorino said in a Monday statement the problem \"underscores the urgency of ensuring that all migration is safe.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The whole of society must work together to reverse these shocking trends,\" Vitorino said.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/international/3638846-why-the-us-is-lowering-flags-for-queen-elizabeth/",
        "description": "<p>If you walk by a federal government building between now and next Monday evening, you’ll see U.S. flags flying at half-staff to honor Queen Elizabeth II, Britain’s longest-serving monarch who passed away on Thursday at the age of 96.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Presidents regularly order flags to be flown at half-staff to mark certain holidays and the mourning of government officials, but President Biden last week made the rare move of bestowing the honor upon a foreign dignitary. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden’s order prescribes flags to be flown at half-staff until sunset on the day of the queen's interment, which is scheduled for next Monday. Biden will also attend Elizabeth’s funeral in London.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) gave a similar order for flags at the Capitol. Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, tweeted that the House on Tuesday will also pass a bereavement resolution for the queen before adjourning for the day in her honor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement was met with criticism from some Twitter users, who noted the U.S. was founded out of a war with Britain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Good lord man, did we not fight the American Revolution?” one user wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The House did the same for her father King George VI in 1952. This is precedent,” Hammill responded to another user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden’s decision to lower flags for a foreign leader is rare, although his order has precedent for prominent global leaders like the queen. But the 12-day period is longer than when orders were given to honor recent foreign dignitaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden previously gave the honor to Shinzo Abe, Japan’s longest-serving prime minister who was assassinated in July, and past presidents have ordered flags to half-staff a handful of times over the years for foreign dignitaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the honor is more often reserved for domestic officials who die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. Flag Code lays out the circumstances in which flags should be flown at half-staff, although the president is authorized to change any of the rules if they feel it is appropriate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Flag Code states the American flag should be flown at half-staff on Memorial Day until noon and for the full day on Peace Officers Memorial Day, unless the holiday coincides with Armed Forces Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also indicates flags are to be flown at half-staff for 30 days following the death of a current or former president and 10 days following the death of the sitting vice president, current or retired Supreme Court chief justice or the sitting House Speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>American flags should also be flown at half-staff until interment for sitting associate justices of the Supreme Court, secretaries of federal departments, governors and former vice presidents. When a sitting member of Congress dies, flags should be at half-staff on the day of death and the following day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For foreign officials, the Flag Code leaves the decision up to the president.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In the event of the death of other officials or foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at half-staff according to Presidential instructions or orders, or in accordance with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law,” the code states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Past presidents have given the honor to prominent global leaders upon their death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former President Obama ordered U.S. flags to half-staff following the deaths of Shimon Peres, Israel’s former prime minister and president who died in 2016, and Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s first post-apartheid president who died in 2013. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The honor was also bestowed upon the deaths of Pope John Paul II in 2005 and Jordan’s King Hussein in 1999.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Presidents have also on occasion lowered flags to half-staff upon the assassinations of foreign leaders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden did so for Abe, who was shot and killed in Japan during a campaign event in July. Former President Clinton ordered the honor for former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995, and former President Reagan did so for former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flags will fly at half-staff for the queen for a total of 12 days, a period far longer than any of the other foreign leaders honored in recent decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the length is largely due to Britain’s 10-day mourning period. Biden’s order spans from the day of Elizabeth’s death until sunset on the day of her interment, scheduled for next Monday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Except for Biden’s honoring of Abe and the two foreign leaders honored by Obama, presidents have typically ordered flags to half-staff until the leaders’ interments. The half-staff period lasted for a single-digit number of days in all of those instances.</p>",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/jorge-soler-unlikely-to-return-this-season.html",
        "description": "<p>Marlins outfielder Jorge Soler has been on the injured list since July due to low back spasms. Though he’s tried ramping up baseball activities since then, he isn’t likely to make it back to the team this year. Manager Don Mattingly tells MLB.com that Soler’s return is “probably out the window.” Soler himself tells Daniel Álvarez-Montes of El Extra Base “I don’t think I’ll be back this season.”</p>\n<p>It will go down as a disappointing campaign for the slugger, who rode into the offseason riding high, having just helped Atlanta win a championship and earned World Series MVP in the process. The Marlins, stacked with pitching but light on hitting, grabbed Soler and Avisaíl García in free agency, hoping to add some thump to their lineup. Unfortunately, both have dealt with injuries and underperformance this season. Soler only got into 72 games before this back issue cropped up and was a below-average hitter before then. If he is indeed done for the season, he will finish with a batting line of .207/.295/.400. That production is 3% lower than that of the league average hitter, according to wRC+.</p>\n<p>The three-year, $36MM deal that Soler and the Marlins signed in the winter allows him to opt-out after each season. Soler tells Álvarez-Montes that he hasn’t thought about his decision and has yet to speak to his agent about it. However, it’s hard to imagine Soler deciding to leave money on the table and return to the open market, especially with this lingering injury situation. He’s earning $12MM this year and is set to earn $15MM in 2023 and another $9MM in 2024, with that 2024 salary able to increase based on plate appearance bonuses.</p>\n<p>If Soler is back with the Fish next year, they will surely be hoping for better results from both he and García. As a team, the Marlins have hit .229/.294/.363, producing an 86 wRC+, ranking them 27th in the league. That’s largely why they’ve had another season of poor results, going 57-82 so far. Solar and García are the only players on the team making eight-figure salaries and that is set to be the case again next year. Bounceback seasons from those two will be integral to better performance in 2023, though the club is reportedly going to try to use its pitching depth to improve the offense this winter.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The primary reason the Knicks inked Evan Fournier to a four-year, $78 million contract last summer was for the Frenchman to knock down three-pointers. And that he did. Fournier started a team-high 80 games in 2021-22 and canned a franchise record 241 triples. The only players with more made 3-pointers last season were Stephen Curry, Buddy Hield and Fred VanVleet. And Fournier shot a higher percentage from downtown (38.9%) than Steph, Hield and FVV. </p><p>However, Fournier didn't bring much to the table besides long-range bombs. He averaged 14.1 points (his lowest scoring output since 2014-15) and shot a career-worst 41.7% from the floor and a career-low 70.8% from the free-throw line.</p><p>What's on Tap with Tommy Beer is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.</p><p>Nonetheless, I'm not here to suggest that Fournier deserves to be demoted due to inexcusably inferior performance. Instead, shifting him to the second unit and promoting Quentin Grimes to the starting five makes the most sense for the franchise in both the short and long term, mainly due to defensive issues. </p><p>And, as expected, Fournier struggled on the defensive end. The Knicks allowed 112.5 per 100 possessions with Fournier on the floor. New York allowed eight fewer points per 100 possessions with him on the bench. The only rotation player with a worse Defensive Rating was Kemba Walker. </p><p>Conversely, Grimes earned minutes early on as a rookie (not an easy task under head coach Tom Thibodeau) because of his tenacity and effectiveness as a defender. Grimes was able to use his size and athleticism to hound opponents on the perimeter. Grimes' ability to check the other team's top offensive options is crucial on a squad lacking top-tier defenders in the backcourt and on the wing. </p><p>While Jalen Brunson is an upgrade defensively over Kemba - who started at PG over the first half of last season - Brunson is undersized, which limits his versatility on that end. It's tough to envision New York consistently getting the stops they need early in games if Brunson, Fournier, and Julius Randle make up three-fifths of the starting lineup. (The Knicks posted a Net Rating of -3.6 in the first quarter over the first half of the 2021-22 campaign and a Net Rating of +2.9 in the second quarter.)  </p><p>Furthermore, Grimes can contribute on the offensive end as well.  </p><p>Grimes exuded remarkable self-confidence as soon as he set foot on an NBA court. In his first career start (vs. Milwaukee on December 12th), Grimes poured in 27 points and knocked down seven three-pointers, the most ever by a Knicks rookie. (Here's a handful of players to score at least 25 points in their first career start: Magic Johnson, Isiah Thomas, Ron Harper, Grant Hill, Jerry Stackhouse, Allen Iverson, Lamar Odom, Grant Hill, LeBron James.) Grimes followed that up by scoring 15 points and nailing five triples in his next appearance. </p><p>In the three games in which he started and logged more than 32 minutes, Grimes averaged 22.0 points, 4.6 rebounds, 5.6 made three-pointers and 2.0 steals.  </p><p>He finished the season converting 72 of his 189 three-point attempts (38.1%). Trey Murphy was the only other qualified rookie to shoot above 38% from downtown. Grimes also took care of the basketball, averaging just 0.6 turnovers per game. He is one of just two rookies in league history to make over 70 treys and commit fewer than 30 TOs.</p><p>Grimes posted a higher effective field goal percentage than Fournier in 2021-22 and averaged a team-high 1.20 points per spot-up possession. Grimes finished the season ranked in the 91st percentile league-wide as a spot-up shooter. </p><p>And as we saw in the Las Vegas Summer League, he is focused on expanding his game. Grimes' ability and willingness to put the ball on the floor and attack the tin was particularly encouraging (he took only 22 shots at the rim last year as a rookie). The Knicks coaching staff in Vegas even asked him to occasionally bring the ball up the floor and facilitate the offense. Grimes dished out 4.0 assists per game to go along with 22.6 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.4 made triples over five contests in Vegas. </p><p>The only other player to average at least 20/4/4 in Summer League action over the past few years was Sixers guard Tyrese Maxey in 2021. We saw what happened when Maxey was inserted into the starting lineup for Philadelphia last season; he emerged as one of the league's most improved players as his scoring average jumped from 8.0 to 17.5 PPG.</p><p>The main story this offseason in New York was, of course, the Knicks' pursuit of Donovan Mitchell. And based on the outcome, one clear takeaway is that the Knicks front office believes in their young core. And while players like RJ Barrett, Obi Toppin and Immanuel Quickley were all included in different proposed packages, some reports indicated that Grimes was essentially off-limits. Now, with Mitchell in Cleveland, it makes sense that the Knicks find out precisely what they have in these young prospects they were unwilling to part with. </p><p>Grimes has the chance to develop into a high-quality 3-and-D wing, which is incredibly valuable in today's NBA. </p><p>And as far as Fournier is concerned, assuming New York is unable to trade him before the start of the season, having him prove he can contribute as an offensive focal point on the second unit might boost his value league-wide, considering a contender trading for the veteran would likely view Fournier as a complimentary role player as opposed to a high-volume shooter. </p><p>Thus, having Grimes replace Fournier in the starting unit makes sense on multiple levels. Let's see if it happens. </p><p>What's on Tap with Tommy Beer is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.</p>",

        "description": "<p>With the Donovan Mitchell saga in the rear-view mirror, let's begin wrapping up our \"The Top 75 Knicks of All Time\" series. </p><p>We cracked the top 10 in our previous installment, with Earl Monroe, Allan Houston, Carmelo Anthony and Bill Bradley.  </p><p>What's on Tap with Tommy Beer is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.</p><p>7. Harry GallatinHarry \"The Horse\" was one of the NBA's best rebounders during the 1950s. Although he was undersized at just 6-foot-6, he averaged double-digit rebounds each season from 1950 through 1958. Gallatin led the NBA in boards in 1953-54, pulling down 15.3 rebounds per game and was named to the All-NBA First Team that season. He grabbed 33 rebounds in one game in 1953, a Knicks record that still stands. Gallatin was also incredibly durable. He played in 610 consecutive regular-season games and 57 postseason contests. He was named an All-Star in seven straight seasons, from 1950-51 through 1956-57.</p><p>Gallatin said being drafted by the Knicks in 1948 \"was a dream come true,\" adding, \"I really didn't know what to expect; it was my first plane ride, from St. Louis to New York. Here I am, a boy from Wood River, a country boy, and going to the Big Apple.\" During the off-seasons between his first three years in the NBA, Gallatin played minor league baseball in Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds systems. After retiring as a player, Gallatin went on to coach and won the NBA Coach of the Year award in 1964 with the Atlanta Hawks. He also coached the Knicks for a season before being replaced by Dick McGuire.</p><p>6. Bernard KingKing was an offensive machine. A crafty and powerful 6-foot-7 small forward, he was truly one of the best scores the league has ever seen. And if it weren't for debilitating injuries, who knows how high he'd rank on this list. </p><p>Born and raised in Brooklyn, Bernard was a prep star at BK's Fort Hamilton High School before enrolling at the University of Tennessee. After averaging nearly 26 points per game as a junior, King declared for the 1977 Draft and was selected by the Nets with the 7th overall pick. He finished in the top 10 in the NBA in scoring as a rookie, pouring in more than 24 points a night. However, alcohol and drug issues began to wreak havoc. The Nets traded him to the Jazz in 1979, but he played only 19 games for Utah before seeking treatment for substance abuse. The Jazz shipped him to Golden State (for Wayne Cooper and a second-round pick), and he averaged 21.9 ppg in 1980-81 while shooting nearly 59% from the floor, en route to being named NBA Comeback Player of the Year. The following season, he led the Warriors with 23.2 ppg, made his first All-Star Game appearance and was selected to the All-NBA Second Team. </p><p>As a free agent in 1982, King signed with New York, but the Warriors exercised their \"right of first refusal,\" matching the offer and then trading King to the Knicks for Micheal Ray Richardson and a draft choice. King took his game to another level in New York, playing the best basketball of his career. </p><p>In 1983-84, King ranked fifth in the NBA, scoring 26.3 points per game. On January 31st and February 1st that season, he posted back-to-back 50-point outings against the San Antonio Spurs and the Dallas Mavericks. In the playoffs that year, King put the Knicks on his back and nearly single-handedly carried them to the Finals. </p><p>His performance in the first round against Detroit was utterly unbelievable. Game 1: 36 points (15-of-26 shooting)Game 2: 46 points (18-of-35)Game 3: 46 points (19-of-27)Game 4: 41 points (15-of-25)Game 5: 44 points (17-of-26)</p><p>In a brutally tough second-round matchup with Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics, King was at it again. New York lost in a decisive seventh game, but Bernard did everything asked of him. During the Knicks' playoff run that year, King AVERAGED 34.8 points while shooting over 57% from the floor. Think about that for a second. </p><p>Somehow, King was even better in 1984-85, as he led the NBA in scoring at 32.9 PPG. On Christmas Day of 1985, he hung 60 points on New Jersey (a Knick franchise record until Melo bested it). Six weeks later, he scored 55 points vs. the Nets.</p><p>The following month, disaster struck. In a March 23rd game at Kansas City, King tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. The injury was so significant that he missed the entire following season and all but the final six games of the 1986-87 campaign. </p><p>In his final 20 games before wrecking his knee, King was averaging over 36 points (on 55% shooting) to go along with 6.5 rebounds and 4.2 assists. </p><p>Remarkably, King returned to greatness after fully rehabbing his ACL injury. As a member of the Bullets, he averaged 17.2 points per game in his first full season in Washington. Eventually, King upped his scoring average up to 28.4 PPG by 1990-91, which ranked third in the NBA behind only Michael Jordan and Karl Malone. However, King was forced to undergo another knee surgery prior to the start of the 91-92 season and was never the same player. </p><p>In 2013, King was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. His career scoring average (26.5) is the second highest amongst all Knicks.</p><p>5. Richie GuerinGuerin, who grew up in the Bronx, served in the Marine Corps Reserve from 1947 to 1954. While a reservist, he attended Iona College and established himself as one of the best collegiate players in the country. The Knicks selected Guerin with the 8th pick in the second round of the 1954 NBA draft, but he wouldn't make his NBA debut until 1956. After graduation, Guerin served on active duty at Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, Virginia, for two years. </p><p>The Knicks was often not very good during Guerin's tenure with the Knicks, making the playoffs just once, but Guerin was great. He is one of only two Knicks in franchise history to average over 29 points per game for an entire season, pouring in 29.5 points in 1961-62. But Guerin wasn't just a scorer. In that aforementioned 1961-62 campaign, he also averaged 6.4 rebounds and 6.9 assists. Per BasketballReference.com, Guerin is one of only four players in NBA history to average at least 29.5 points, 6.5 assists and six rebounds over the course of an entire season. The other three players in that elite club are Oscar Robertson, Michael Jordan and LeBron James. During his prime, from 1957-58 through 1961-62, Guerin averaged 7.2 rebounds and six assists per game. He played in six consecutive NBA All-Star Games. His individual game career-highs of 57 points and 21 assists stood as franchise records for more than 50 years. He was traded to the St. Louis Hawks in 1964 and spent the next eight years as the team's player-coach and then head coach. </p><p>What's on Tap with Tommy Beer is a reader-supported publication.

        "description": "<p>With the Donovan Mitchell sweepstakes now completed, I remain astonished at how the final days of the soap opera played out. </p><p>Utah definitely got a solid package in return for their star shooting guard, but the Knicks had the assets to beat Cleveland's best offer. Remarkably, Danny Ainge didn't go back to Leon Rose and say, \"Okay, the Cavs are offering me X, Y and Z. I know our negotiations have been contentious, but I'll give you one last chance to make a best and final offer.\" Instead, New York found out that Mitchell was Cleveland-bound after the deal was done. </p><p>For what it's worth, Ric Bucher of Fox Sports reported over the weekend that some Jazz officials were unhappy that Mitchell wanted out and viewed sending him to Cleveland, rather than home to New York, as \"payback.\" And we know that Ainge and company were furious that a Knicks contingent featuring World Wide Wes and Allan Houston sat courtside during Game 1 of the Dallas-Utah first-round playoff series in April. Not to mention the tension and animosity that tends to arise between clubs once negotiations actually begin. </p><p>It seems undeniable that egos, emotions and feelings got involved in the talks between the Knicks and Jazz over the six weeks the teams went back and forth.</p><p>As a reminder, the Cavaliers sent Lauri Markkanen, Ochai Agbaji, Collin Sexton, and three unprotected first-round picks (2025, 2027 and 2029) and two pick swaps (2026 and 2028) to Utah in exchange for Mitchell.</p><p>Markkanen has three years left on the four-year, $67.4 million contract he inked last summer. He'll make an average of $17.2 million over the next three seasons. Sexton signed a four-year, $72 million (fully guaranteed) pact as part of the sign-and-trade. He'll make an average of $18 million over the life of the contract. Agbaji was the 14th pick in the 2022 draft.</p><p>Jazz supporters have argued that the players Utah received are superior to what the Knicks were offering. That's debatable. </p><p>Various reports have indicated that as of last weekend, New York was willing to part with RJ Barrett, Immanuel Quickley and three future first-round picks (two unprotected and one with only top-5 protections), along with two second-round picks and two pick swaps. I'm also going to assume the Knicks were open to including Miles McBride and/or Rokas Jokubaitis in the deal, as those two youngsters would have had a tough time cracking the rotation in a New York backcourt that featured Jalen Brunson, Mitchell, Derrick Rose and Quentin Grimes.</p><p>Is Sexton/Markkanen combo a better player package than Barrett and IQ? </p>\n      <p>\n          \n              Read more\n          \n      </p>",

        "description": "<p>So, I had just finished printing out the cheat sheets for my final fantasy draft and was packing my daughter into the car to take her to the pool when … BOOM!... the Woj Bomb detonated. </p><p>And just like that, after days and weeks and months of deliberation and debate about the pros and cons of a potential Donovan Mitchell deal, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski broke the news that Mr. Mitchell would be playing in Cleveland, not New York, next season.</p><p>The particulars: The Cavaliers are sending Lauri Markkanen (about to enter the second year of a four-year, $67 million contract), Ochai Agbaji, Collin Sexton (who inked a four-year, $72 million contract as part of the sig-and-trade), three unprotected first-round picks (2025, 2027 and 2029) and two pick swaps (2026 and 2028) to Utah in exchange for Mitchell.</p><p>I do think this trade makes a lot of sense from the Cavs perspective. They do have to worry about Mitchell leaving via free agency in a few years (more on that in a bit), but from a roster standpoint, Mitchell is an excellent fit in Cleveland. He provides them with an elite offensive weapon capable of dominating playoff games and will have Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen behind him to clean up his defensive shortcomings. With their young core of Darius Garland, Isaac Okoro, Mobley and Allen all locked up for the foreseeable future, Cleveland was well positioned to make an \"all-in\" move for Mitchell. </p><p>Cleveland finished last season six games above .500 and is clearly a team on the rise and ready to make some serious noise.</p><p>The Knicks, on the other hand, are at the start of a rebuild, which always made a move for Mitchell somewhat problematic.</p><p>That's not to suggest that it would have been a mistake. As I've written repeatedly, players of Mitchell's caliber are rarely available. He's a 25-year-old stud who has already proven he's one of the very best offensive players on the planet. He's a winner. And he still had three years left on his current contract.</p><p>Yet, as I've also noted, Mitchell is a 6'1\" shooting guard whose effort and commitment on the defensive end raise red flags. </p><p>There's a reason why after months of hanging a big red \"For Sale\" sign around the franchise cornerstone, the best player Danny Ainge and Utah got back in a deal for Mitchell was Collin Sexton, a talented but flawed combo guard, who was still a restricted free agent two months after hitting the open market. Yes, the Cavs gave up three future picks, but they didn't give up a single player they deemed a valuable contributor. </p><p>Conversely, the Knicks would have been forced to part with arguably the best young prospect the franchise has had in decades, multiple unprotected picks and at least one additional young player on a team-friendly rookie contract.</p>\n      <p>\n          \n              Read more\n          \n      </p>",

        "description": "<p>Late last night, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN broke the news that RJ Barrett and the Knicks had agreed to a four-year extension. </p><p>Yes, folks, that means the Curse of Charlie Ward has been snapped, as Barrett is the first Knicks first-round draft pick to ink a multiyear contract extension after his rookie deal since Ward signed a five-year, $28 million contract in January of 1999. (With the Mitchell Robinson extension also completed, the Knicks have now signed more players coming off rookie deals in the past two months than they did over the first two decades of the 21st century.) </p><p>There's plenty to discuss but first let's tackle the financials. According to Shams Charania of The Athletic, Barrett's deal will pay him $107 million guaranteed over four years and could be worth up to $120 million with incentives. Ian Begley of SNY reports that the bonuses in Barrett's deal are tied to selections to the All-Star Game, any of the three All-NBA teams or either of the two All-NBA Defensive teams.</p><p>After pocketing $10.9 million in 2022-23 (the final year of his rookie contract), Barrett will earn approximately $27 million annually over the next four seasons. That number could approach $30 million per year if Barrett meets the abovementioned incentives. The Knicks front office hopes he does, as that would mean Barrett had established himself as a top-20 NBA player before celebrating his 25th birthday. </p>\n      <p>\n          \n              Read more\n          \n      </p>",

        "description": "<p>Hey everybody - I hope you guys had a wonderful weekend.</p><p>Here is a quick recap of the news from the Donovan Mitchell front over the past few days:</p><p>What's on Tap with Tommy Beer is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.</p><p>🏀 The Cleveland Cavaliers have removed themselves from Mitchell trade talks, according to Ian Begley of SNY. Begs notes that \"with the Cavs out of the picture, the Knicks seem to be in the best position to land Mitchell in a trade,\" adding, \"at the moment, there doesn't appear to be any suitors who can approach what the Knicks can offer – even if you take RJ Barrett off the table.\"</p><p>🏀 Speaking of RJ, Strong Island's own Alan Hahn refuted reports that coach Tom Thibodeau would prefer to trade Barrett. \"Don't buy that. At all,\" Hahn said. \"I can tell you Tom Thibodeau is a huge fan of RJ Barrett. Has been from Day One. Loves the kid. Loves his work ethic. Everything about him… Thibs doesn't want to see [RJ] in the deal.\" For what it's worth, I've heard much of the same. The Knicks coaching staff and front office highly value RJ's professionalism and work ethic and are firm believers in his upside. I'd be very surprised if RJ is traded, as New York values Barrett more than Utah.</p><p>🏀 On the most recent episode of ESPN's The Hoop Collective podcast, Tim MacMahon reported that the Jazz are looking to obtain the best offers possible for Mitchell by mid-September, as the organization wants to avoid dealing with a \"circus\" next month. \"Basically, they're trying to get the Knicks to put the kind of offer that it will take to get Donovan Mitchell on the table before training camp,\" MacMahon said. </p><p>🏀 According to Tony Jones of The Athletic, Mitchell hasn't asked for a trade from the Jazz, \"but, if he were to be traded, sources say, his preferred destination would be one of three places: the Knicks, the Brooklyn Nets, or the Miami Heat.\"</p><p>🏀 The Knicks are willing to move Julius Randle but haven't found a willing trade partner, according to Fred Katz of The Athletic. \"The four remaining seasons on Randle's deal have made teams, even ones who believe last season wasn't representative of who he is, hesitant about acquiring him. The Knicks, meanwhile, haven't been willing to attach a first-rounder or two to send him elsewhere,\" writes Katz.</p><p>🏀 Per Jovan Buha of The Athletic, the Lakers \"aren't interested\" in taking back Randle from the Knicks, \"considering his contract (three years plus a player option on the fourth year) and less-than-ideal fit\" with Anthony Davis and LeBron James. Buha also wrote that it's \"more likely\" that Russell Westbrook will not be on the Lakers' roster by the time training camp begins. </p><p>🏀 In his Sunday Substack, Marc Stein reported that the Lakers could maneuver their way into a potential three-way deal for Mitchell. \"If the Knicks manage to win the trade race for Utah's Donovan Mitchell, or even if another team unexpectedly beats them to Mitchell, league sources say there's a decent chance that the Lakers will be involved in the deal. The two future first-round picks that the Lakers possess in 2027 and 2029 are the kind of top-shelf draft picks that Jazz CEO Danny Ainge is believed to covet. Russell Westbrook's $47 million expiring contract and those picks could be the Lakers' entree to a potential three-team swap.\"</p><p>Okay, so let's focus on those last two nuggets. In my previous post last Tuesday, I pitched a three-way that would send Randle to LA. (The following day, LA traded Talen Horton-Tucker and Stanley Johnson to Utah for Patrick Beverley.) With the Lakers reportedly uninterested in Randle, might Evan Fournier make more sense for Los Angeles? Back to the Trade Machine, y'all.</p><p>Which side says \"no\" to this blockbuster?</p><p>The Lakers trade away:Russell Westbrook, Damian Jones, Wenyen Gabriel, their 2027 first-round draft pick (unprotected), their 2023 second-round pick, their 2025 second-round pick, and the Chicago Bulls' 2023 second-rounder. </p><p>The Lakers receive:Evan Fournier, Mike Conley, Cam Reddish and Jordan Clarkson.</p><p>The Knicks trade away:Evan Fournier, Obi Toppin, Cam Reddish, Deuce McBride, Rokas Jokubaitis and their 2023 first-round pick (unprotected), their 2025 first-round pick (unprotected), a 2026 first-round pick swap (top-ten protected), their 2027 first-round pick (unprotected), their 2025 second-round pick, their 2027 second-round pick, the Detroit Pistons (protected) 2023 first-round draft pick, and the Washington Wizards 2023 (protected) first-round draft pick.</p><p>The Knicks receive:Donovan Micthell, Wenyen Gabriel, Rudy Gay</p><p>The Jazz trade away:Donovan Micthell, Mike Conley, Rudy Gay and Jordan Clarkson.</p><p>The Jazz receive: Obi Toppin, Deuce McBride, Rokas Jokubaitis, Damian Jones, Russell Westbook (to be bought out), the Lakers' 2027 first-round draft pick (unprotected), LA's 2023 second-round pick, LA's 2025 second-round pick, the Chicago Bulls 2023 second-round pick, NY's 2023 first-round pick (unprotected), NY 2025 first-round pick (unprotected), NY 2026 first-round pick swap (top-ten protected), NY's 2027 first-round pick (unprotected), NY's 2025 second-round pick, NY's 2027 second-round pick, the Detroit Pistons (protected) 2023 first-round pick, and the Washington Wizards 2023 (protected) first-round pick.</p><p>Why it makes sense for the Lakers:</p><p>LeBron James will celebrate his 38th birthday in December. The Lakers finished 11th in the Western Conference last season, 16 games below .500 (33-49). Not only have the Lakers failed to add a star this offseason, but they also lost Malik Monk (who led their team in made 3-pointers and was third in total points and assists in 2021-22) via free agency. Outside of LeBron and AD, their roster is remarkably uninspiring. If they don't make any more moves, they will be forced to rely on guys like Lonnie Walker IV, Thomas Bryant, Austin Reaves, Juan Toscano-Anderson, and Kendrick Nunn as crucial contributors. Two of those five will likely be part of their starting/closing lineups. </p><p>Adding Fournier, Conley, Reddish and Clarkson provides LA with a massive upgrade in the backcourt and wing. Fournier would give the Lakers the long-range marksmanship they desperately need. He knocked down 241 three-pointers last season while shooting 38.9% from downtown. Steph Curry and Trae Young were the only other players in the NBA to make more than 230 treys and shoot at least 38% from the deep. </p><p>Conley, a proven winner, would be a good fit at PG, serving as a distributor who can keep defenses honest with his long-range touch (a career 38% shooter from behind the arc). He is just a year removed from an All-Star campaign, averaging 16.2 points, 6.0 assists and 2.7 treys and 1.4 steals for Utah in 2020-21. Reddish is a young (he's still just 22 years old), promising wing whom New York acquired in mid-January in exchange for a future first-round pick. The Lakers reportedly had interest in trading for Reddish earlier this year. Clarkson was named the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year in 2020-21 after averaging 18.3 points per game off the bench.</p><p>If the Lakers want to be considered serious title contenders, they must make a move. The benefit of this trade is it would only cost LA one first-rounders. Would they prefer this type of deal vs. a trade with the Pacers that may cost them their 2027 and 2029 picks? In addition, there's not a ton of long-term money coming back in this package. Fournier has two guaranteed years left on his deal (a third season is a team option). Conley's contract in 2023-24 is only partially guaranteed, and Clarkson has a player option for 23-24. </p><p>Why it makes sense for the Knicks:</p><p>A heavy contingent of Knicks fans will be furious if New York trades Obi Toppin and a bevy of unprotected picks. However, you gotta give to get. And if the reports that NY cannot move Randle without attaching valuable draft capital, then it makes sense to sacrifice Obi to hold onto Immanuel Quickley and Quentin Grimes. The Knicks have three quality centers, so it's not as if Thibs could frequently feature either Obi or Randle as a small ball 5, even if he wanted to. If Randle is healthy, it's difficult to envision Toppin logging more than 20 minutes a night. With Obi entering his age-24 season, using him as a backup makes little sense for the player or the team. Adding Brunson and Mitchell this offseason would make both McBride and Jokubaitis expendable as well. </p><p>Why it makes sense for the Jazz:</p><p>Over and over again, we've heard that Ainge isn't overly concerned with the particular players coming back in a Mitchell deal, as his primary goal is securing as many picks as possible. This deal would net Utah six future first-rounders, four of which are unprotected, in addition to five second-round selections.  </p><p>Additionally, it would help clear Utah's cap sheet going forward. If this deal were consummated, the only player with a guaranteed contract north of $4 million next season would be Jarred Vanderbilt. Buying out Westbrook's contract would enable Utah to reach the salary floor this season. Utah could position themselves to enter free agency with more cap space than any team in the NBA in 2023 or 2024, etc. </p><p>Furthermore, the Jazz would still have Bojan Bogdanovic's expiring contract to flip at the deadline (or before) to secure additional draft capital. </p><p>Obi's upside is obvious. He started each of the Knicks' final five regular-season games this past season and averaged a whopping 27.2 points, 6.2 rebounds, 3.8 made three-pointers and 2.8 assists. Over the final month of the 2021-22 campaign, Toppin shot 57.4% from the floor, 42.3% from downtown and 81.3% from the free-throw stripe. </p><p>McBride appeared in nine games for the Westchester Knicks in 2021-22. In those nine contests, he averaged 29.1 points, 11.1 assists, 5.8 rebounds, 4.6 made three-pointers and 2.7 steals, shooting over 47% from the floor and a scorching 51.9% from downtown. In the process, he became the first player in G League history to average more than 29 points, 11 dimes and five boards.</p><p>Jokubaitis was named the EuroLeague's Rising Star Trophy winner for the 2021-22 season, which is a significant achievement. Prior to Rokas, each of the last seven players to win the award have been selected in the first round of the NBA draft, with several of them being taken in the top half of the lottery.  </p><p>What's on Tap with Tommy Beer is a reader-supported publication.

        "description": "<p>As I discussed earlier today, the KD domino falling impacts teams across the country, from South Beach to Long Beach. </p><p>The Los Angeles Lakers had reportedly been trying to pry Kyrie Irving from Brooklyn in exchange for Russell Westbrook and a future first-rounder. Now that Durant is headed back to Brooklyn for at least one more season, it certainly seems safe to assume Irving will spend the full 2022-23 campaign alongside his buddy, KD. </p><p>What's on Tap with Tommy Beer is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.</p><p>With Irving off the table, will the Lakers finally engage with Indiana on the long-rumored deal involving Myles Turner and Buddy Heild for Westbrook and picks? Or might LeBron and company prefer a burly, high-scoring power forward? Julius Randle, who was originally drafted by the Lakers, could provide the Lakers with so much-needed offensive punch.</p><p>After the Durant News broke, Shams Charania of The Athletic reported that LA is \"open to anything that'll make their team better.\" Interestingly, Shams mentioned two members of the Utah Jazz by name - Patrick Beverley or Bojan Bogdanovic - as players to “keep an eye on.”</p><p>“If you can go get two, three rotation players to plug onto your team, kind of get better with the sum of your parts,” said Shams on the Pat McAfee Show, “those are the types of moves I think you're gonna see the Lakers try to make.”</p><p>Which got me thinking and forced me to break out the ESPN Trade Machine. So, hear me out, which side says “no” to this hypothetical three-team blockbuster:</p><p></p><p>The Knicks trade away:Julius Randle, Cam Reddish, Deuce McBride, Rokas Jokubaitis and their 2023 first-round pick (unprotected), their 2025 first-round pick (unprotected), a 2026 first-round pick swap (top-ten protected), their 2027 first-round pick (unprotected), the Pistons (protected) 2023 first-round draft pick, the Bucks 2025 (protected) first-round draft pick.</p><p>The Knicks receive:Donovan Micthell and Rudy Gay</p><p>The Lakers trade away:Russell Westbrook, Talen Horton-Tucker, their 2027 first-round draft pick (top-3 protected) and their 2029 first-round draft pick (top-10 protected)</p><p>The Lakers receive:Julius Randle, Bojan Bogdanovic, Patrick Beverley and Jordan Clarkson.</p><p>The Jazz trade away:Donovan Micthell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Patrick Beverley, Rudy Gay and Jordan Clarkson.</p><p>The Jazz receive: Talen Horton-Tucker, Russell Westbook (to be bought out), Cam Reddish, Deuce McBride, Rokas Jokubaitis, the Lakers' 2027 first-round draft pick (top-3 protected), the Lakers' 2029 first-round draft pick (top-10 protected), NY’s 2023 first-round pick (unprotected), NY 2025 first-round pick (unprotected), NY 2026 first-round pick swap (top-ten protected), NY’s 2027 first-round pick (unprotected), the Pistons (protected) 2023 first-round draft pick owned by NY, the Bucks 2025 (protected) first-round draft pick owned by NY</p><p>🏀Why it makes sense for the Knicks:</p><p>As I’ve written previously, the ideal, best-case scenario for New York has always been flipping either Evan Fournier or (preferably) Randle to a third party in exchange for draft capital and rerouting those picks to the Jazz. This would help the Knicks clear up cap space and avoid a potential logjam at certain positions while enabling New York to hold onto their promising prospects. It’s been reported that Utah has no interest in Randle, and understandably so, as his four-year $100+ million extension is about to kick in. </p><p>Trading Randle to LA would not only prevent the Knicks from including all their future picks but would also enable New York to hold onto all three of their prized youngster (Obi Toppin, Immanuel Quickley and Quentin Grimes). In addition, trading Randle would open up a spot in the starting lineup for Toppin, a former lottery pick who showed flashes of enticing upside late last season. Rudy Gay could serve as a quality backup at forward. (As an aside, I’d also predict Carmelo Anthony returning to New York to provide some depth upfront before retiring as a Knick.) </p><p>🏀 Why it makes sense for the Lakers:</p><p>After LeBron James signed a two-year extension worth $97 million with the Lakers last week, NBA insider Marc Stein reported that LA’s VP of basketball operations, Rob Pelinka, \"assured\" LeBron that the Lakers front office is willing to part with their 2027 and 2029 first-round picks. \"L.A. has pledged to James that it will indeed continue to aggressively pursue upgrades,” Stein wrote in his Substack. “League sources say James, in fact, has been assured that the Lakers are willing to trade both of their available future first-round picks in 2027 and 2029 if a trade that costs them both picks can realistically position the Lakers to return to contender status.\"</p><p>So, what’s the best return LA could get for a pack of Russ and two future first-rounders? Is it the aforementioned deal with Indiana involving Turner and Heild? What else might other teams be willing to pony up if the Lakers let it be known the two picks are up for grabs? </p><p>This hypothetical three-way would be appealing to the Lakers for several reasons. First, it would give them an incredible infusion of veteran depth and talent. LA crumbled last season whenever LeBron and/or Anthony Davis missed time. </p><p>Even in a \"down year\" in 2021-22, Randle averaged 20.1 points, 9.9 boards and 5.1 dimes. The only players to exceed those numbers in each category last season were Nikola Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Randle is just 27 years old and squarely in the heart of his prime. Bogdanovic is entering his age-33 season but is still an elite shooter. Over his past four seasons, Bogey averaged 18.3 points, 4.1 rebounds and 2.5 made three-pointers, while shooting a scorching 40.3% from downtown and 86% from the free-throw line. (If the Lakers would prefer Evan Fournier instead of Bogdanovic, New York would likely be amenable to including him in the deal.) Pat Beverley would be a massive upgrade defensively over Westbrook at point guard and provide some much-needed toughness on the perimeter. Jordan Clarkson, also a former Laker, is just one year removed from being named the NBA’s Sixth Man of the year after averaging 18.3 points per game to go along with 4.0 rebounds and 2.4 assists in 2020-21. </p><p>Being able to place some light protections on their future first would undoubtedly appeal to LA. In addition, both Bogey and Beverley are expiring contracts, which would allow the Lakers to clear $33 million off their cap sheet next summer if they allowed both players to walk. Ultimately, this deal might come down to how much faith the Lakers have in Randle and how willing they are to go “all-in” while LeBron is still playing at a very high level. </p><p>🏀 Why it makes sense for Utah:</p><p>Earlier this month, HoopsHype's Michael Scotto reported that the Lakers discussed a three-team swap with the Jazz and Knicks. Scotto noted the structure was similar to this hypothetical deal. At this point, it seems unlikely that Danny Ainge will be able to recoup the historic haul he was hoping for by trading away Donovan Micthell, a 25-year-old three-time All-Star with three years left on his current contract. Ainge has been unwilling to get New York to cave on his exorbitant asking price, and other teams have thus far been reluctant to give up the farm. </p><p>Yes, Ainge could hold onto Mitchell and look to trade him at the deadline or next summer, but entering the season with Mitchell on the roster is a risky play by Ainge for multiple reasons. Having an All-Star in uniform dramatically increases the chances Utah hangs around .500, which decreases Utah's chances of landing a top lottery pick and a chance at Victor Wembanyama or Scoot Henderson, the prize jewels of the 2023 draft class. </p><p>Once Ainge trades Mitchell, he’ll obviously look to move Bogey and Beverly as well. The question he’d have to ask himself is whether he could get more in separate deals as opposed to packaging all three together.</p><p>In this proposed three-way deal with LA and New York, Ainge could walk away with seven future first-round picks (three of them unprotected), a pick swap, and several promising young players. All told, while it may be slightly less than Ainge was hoping for, that’s a massive return that would position Utah very well going forward. </p><p>Looking at the offseason as a whole, Ainge would be able to tell Utah fans that he traded five players (Mitchell, Bogey, Clarkson, Royce O’Neal and Rudy Gobert) from a Jazz team that won only two playoff games last season in exchange for twelve (12!) future first-round picks (six of them unprotected!) and two pick swaps, and Malik Beasley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Cam Reddish, Deuce McBride, Talen Horton-Tucker, Leandro Bolmaro (the 23rd pick in the 2020 draft) and Walker Kessler (the 22nd overall pick in the 2022 draft). </p><p>The majority of those future first-rounders (and all six of the unprotected picks) would be via New York and Minnesota, the two teams with the worst winning percentages this century. </p><p>What's on Tap with Tommy Beer is a reader-supported publication.

        "link": "https://tommybeer.substack.com/p/week-in-review-takeaways-from-a-twitter",
        "description": "<p>A look back on the week that was… </p><p>🏀 We had a couple of updates on the Donovan Mitchell front over the past few days. On Tuesday, Shams Charania and Tony Jones of The Athletic reported that after weeks of silence, the Knicks and Jazz had re-engaged in trade talks and had a \"fresh conversation.\" </p><p>What's on Tap with Tommy Beer is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.</p><p>However, the piece notes there is \"no traction between\" the two teams and \"no Mitchell trade is imminent for the Jazz.\" Shams adds that New York and Utah \"seriously discussed\" a deal in July until talks \"stalled.\" The sides have purportedly re-ignited talks, but \"hurdles toward a deal remain.\" The Charlotte Hornets and Washington Wizards are also among the teams pursuing Mitchell, according to The Athletic. </p><p>I always find it interesting to attempt to suss out which side of the negotiating table a leak emanates from. It seems likely that Danny Ainge and the Jazz have been responsible for most recent reports. For one, the Knicks front office under Leon Rose tends to move in silence. In addition, Shams reports that Utah is \"comfortable keeping Mitchell into the season and potentially beyond, due to him having three years remaining on his contract\" and that Mitchell \"is believed to be comfortable with either outcome of staying with the Jazz or being traded elsewhere.\" If that were the case, the Jazz would have nearly all the leverage and would be in no rush to get a deal done. </p><p>However, as I detailed earlier this month, pressure may shift as we get closer to training camp. </p><p>🏀 During an interview on SiriusXM radio Wednesday afternoon, Stephen A Smith discussed the Mitchell sweepstakes and let it be known that the Jazz has no interest in Julius Randle and the $100+ million left on his contract. \"Utah didn't want Julius Randle, from what I'm told. They don't want him. The Knicks were willing to unload him,\" said Smith</p><p>For what it's worth, contrary to other insider reporting, Smith did claim that Utah does want RJ Barrett in the deal. In addition to RJ, Utah wants \"at least six first-round picks,\" per Stephen A. </p><p>Smith adamantly argued the Knicks should do what it takes to get Mitchell but acknowledged that giving up that many first-rounders would be ridiculous. \"They need to go get him, but you can't give up six picks for him. That's robbery.\"</p><p>Again, the fact that the Knicks have not yet caved to Ainge's absurd demands is an encouraging sign. </p><p>🏀 Then, on Saturday, New York Post reporter Marc Berman chimed in, reporting that \"there is belief around the league Thibodeau would prefer to give up Barrett in a deal than shooting guard Quentin Grimes\" and that \"Ainge is hot to acquire Grimes for his Jazz rebuilding plan.\" Berman would add that \"some in the Knicks organization aren't fully convinced Barrett is worthy of a maximum rookie contract extension,\" noting that although he scored over 20 points a night, he shot just 40.6% from the floor. \"Barrett was eligible for the rookie extension on July 1, but the Knicks have to see how the Mitchell sweepstakes,\" according to Berman.  </p><p>* For those who follow me on Twitter, you may have seen that I engaged in an unexpected exchange with Nets superstar Kevin Durant earlier in the week. </p><p>I hopped on NBA TV last night to discuss the interaction:</p><p>https://www.nba.com/watch/video/nba-gametime-08-20?plsrc=nba&amp;nba-tv-series=nba-gametime-2022</p><p>The conversation started after KD took to the Bird App to dispute the report by Marc Stein that Durant might consider retiring from the NBA if Brooklyn refused to trade him. I responded to KD, asking him if he were interested in debunking any other rumors - such as the report he wouldn't rescind his trade demand unless head coach Steve Nash and GM Sean Marks were canned.</p><p>Durant replied that the real season starts in a month. In response to a fan who chimed in, KD remarked, \"U think you're entitled to information because u pay for league pass??\"</p><p>My retort: \"Genuinely curious, KD: What information are fans entitled to? If a big Nets fan in Brooklyn has to decide whether to set aside a bunch of his hard-earned money on season tickets, he'd probably want to know if the Nets' best player plans to play for his favorite team next season.\"</p><p>KD shot back: \"You're entitled to what u work for. Now have a great day little fella.\"</p><p>My rejoinder: \"So you gotta work to be remunerated? NBA owners may quote you on this during the next CBA negotiations my guy. Also, I'd like to have a great day but I'm stressed about my fantasy football draft tonight. I'd call ya \"big fella\" - but I can't take Patrick Ewing's name in vain.\"</p><p>(as an aside, my mom texted me later that day and said she thought it was cool I gave Patrick some props lol)</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Durant was quick to point out that NBA owners' have seen their assets appreciate considerably in recent years, as the value of franchises has skyrocketed. \"NBA owners have been eating very well,\" said KD. </p><p>I agreed with that assertion. However, I added, \"you know those dudes are sharks, and they won't stop gorging on profits just because they've had their fair share and are no longer hungry. Players not playing will be a major sticking point during the next round of CBA (collective bargaining agreement) talks, as you know.\"</p><p>Durant then made a comment I wholeheartedly disagree with, asserting: \"Fans and media want a lockout but I don't see one happening, Shit going too well but who really knows right?\"</p><p>I responded thusly: \"bro... fans don't agree on much, but I can promise you with 100% certainty that every real/true NBA fan is praying there isn't a lockout. They just want to watch the game they love. You're wrong about the media also. For many of us, our livelihood depends on the games being played.\"</p><p>Durant claimed, \"y'all have been loudest about a lockout\" and about \"how much the CBA needs to change.\" My reply: \"eh, I'd disagree with that generalization. Any responsible journalist has a responsibility to cover/examine a potential work stoppage. That coverage should include what might lead to a lockout (players sitting out games). But that doesn't mean \"the media\" agrees with the owners.\"</p><p>KD then brought up the issue of teams sitting out healthy players. \"We've seen it the last few years. That gonna get any coverage?\" he asked. </p><p>\"Very good question,\" I answered. \"And one which has been debated A LOT in the media over the years - dating back to Coach Pop sitting healthy players a decade ago. In fact, it was covered so extensively that Adam Silver had to start fining teams $100k for sitting guys in national TV games.\"</p><p>Durant then stated I wanted to \"speak for all media,\" to which I replied: \"I certainly won't pretend I speak for 'all media.' I'm just giving you my opinion. Just as I wouldn't assume you don't claim to speak for all players.\"</p><p>In his final tweet, KD wrote: \"I feel u. I think the league is in a great place, I don't believe there will be a lockout but who really knows.\"</p><p>So, yeah, chopping it with one of the 25 greatest players of all time wasn't how I foresaw my Monday going when I woke up that morning, but it was an engaging and enjoyable conversation. </p><p>Of all the points discussed, I found Durant's seeming animus towards the fans most surprising. A star player having disdain for the media is expected and understandable. In his recent ESPN documentary, I thought Derek Jeter presented this dynamic well from the athlete's point of view. Jeter explained how he knew that the goal for plenty of writers was to bait players into saying something controversial that tabloids could use as a headline to sell papers. Jeter's objective was to be as vanilla as possible and give scribes nothing interesting/gripping to run with. </p><p>So, I wasn't surprised to see Durant take a shot at \"the media,\" as if we are all one big like-minded entity. The rise of shows like \"First Take\" and talking heads such as Skip Bayless only serve to reinforce players' belief that the media is sensationalist and has little use for facts of any kind. </p><p>However, for KD to suggest that the average fan wanted to see a lockout made no sense. True hoop fans want to watch basketball games no matter which team they root for. They don't care if the players or owners get 49% or 51% of basketball-related revenue in the new CBA. The average fan has no interest whether it's the millionaire players or billionaire owners who take home a larger percentage of the profits. In my opinion, suggesting otherwise is foolish and shows a lack of understanding of where the typical fan is coming from. </p><p>What's on Tap with Tommy Beer is a reader-supported publication.

        "description": "<p>New York Knicks 2019-20 Schedule Highlights: Nine Games New Yorkers Should Circle On Their Calendars</p><p>The NBA released its full schedule for the 2022-23 season on Monday afternoon. Looking ahead toward the 82-game marathon, Knicks fans are hoping this year's squad (with or without Donovan Mitchell) will bounce back and return to the playoffs for the second time in the last nine seasons. </p><p> Listed below are 11 games New Yorkers should circle on their calendars.</p><p>* October 19: Knicks at Memphis Grizzlies:</p><p>The Knicks open the 2022-23 campaign in Memphis, which was one of the most challenging places to play in the NBA last season. The Grizz went 30-11 at home last year. Only the Golden State Warriors recorded more home victories. </p><p>* October 21: Knicks vs. Detroit Pistons</p><p>This contest will mark the home debuts of both Jalen Brunson and Isaiah Hartenstein. Expect Brunson to get a very warm greeting from the New York faithful, who have been praying for a point guard since before cell phones were ubiquitous. The contest will also feature the return of former Knicks Alec Burks, Nerlens Noel (acquired via trade) and Kevin Knox (who signed with the Pistons as a free agent this offseason). Jaden Ivey will suit up in the Garden for the first time, but not in the orange and blue. </p><p>* November 15th: Knicks at Utah Jazz:</p><p>Utah won't play any games on ESPN or ABC this entire season. Despite being just a year removed from posting the league's best record, the Jazz plays only one nationally televised game in 2022-23. That one game is the one time they host the Knicks, which will be televised on TNT. As Brian Windhorst might ask: \"Now why is that?\" Do Adam Silver and the NBA schedule makers have a gut feeling that the contest might have a little extra juice for some reason?!? </p><p></p>\n      <p>\n          \n              Read more\n          \n      </p>",

        "link": "https://tommybeer.substack.com/p/wall-street-analyst-predicts-james",
        "description": "<p>Before digging into the Dolan stuff, some information related to the 2022-23 NBA schedule leaked over the past few days. </p><p>The Knicks will open the upcoming season in Memphis against the Grizzlies on October 19th, according to Fred Katz of The Athletic. This contest will feature a showdown between two of the top three picks in the 2019 draft, Ja Morant and RJ Barrett. Ja has already secured his max rookie extension. New York has until the day before the start of the regular season to decide if Barrett will receive the same financial windfall.</p><p>What's on Tap with Tommy Beer is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.</p><p>After James Harden broke the news by tweeting \"Christmas in the Garden!\" multiple outlets have confirmed that the Knicks will play the Philadelphia 76ers on Christmas Day. New York hosted the Hawks last Christmas in a game that started at noon (memorable due to Kemba Walker's triple-double). This year's matchup with the Sixers, one of five games that day, will likely tip off at noon as well.</p><p>The other date we learned about yesterday was the Knicks' lone trip to Dallas during the 2022-23 campaign will take place on December 27th. This is notable because it will be Jalen Brunson's first trip back to the city he spent the first four years of his career. In addition, the Knicks are currently under investigation by the league for possible tampering charges involving their pursuit of Brunson, as New York hired Brunson's father Rick as an assistant coach weeks before free agency began, and Knicks executives Leon Rose and Worldwide Wes traveled to Dallas to sit courtside for the opening game Jazz-Mavs first-round series. So there could certainly be some tension between the two organizations. Furthermore, the Knicks own the rights to the Mavs first-round pick this season. </p><p>The completed 2022-23 NBA schedule is expected to be released this week, possibly as early as Wednesday. </p><p>The other non-schedule-related tidbit to pass along comes from an unlikely source: an interview with Jonathan Boyar on CNBC's 'Closing Bell: Overtime' late last week. </p><p>https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/08/11/investors-need-to-beware-of-false-bargains-says-boyar-value-groups-jonathan-boyar.html</p><p>Some background: Boyar is president of Boyar's Intrinsic Value Research, an independent equity research group established in 1975 that, according to its website, counts some of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, mutual funds and family offices as subscribers. Boyar is also a principal of Boyar Asset Management. It is important to note that clients of Boyar Asset Management research services collectively own approximately 15% of both MSGN and MSGE as of 2020. In addition, Boyar called out Knicks owner James Dolan following the poorly received merger between Madison Square Garden Entertainment and MSG Networks last year. </p><p>One other bit of context: The MSG Sphere at The Venetian is a massive 17,500-seat arena being built in Las Vegas. It is a partnership between The Madison Square Garden Company and Sands Corporation estimated to cost a cool $1.865 billion and is scheduled to open in 2023. MSG Entertainment's senior VP of construction stated in May that the venue will \"absolutely\" be ready to host the FIA Formula One World Championship in November 2023. Upon its completion, the MSG Sphere will reportedly become the largest spherical structure in the world, at 336 feet tall and 516 feet wide, that will be able to accommodate up to 20,000 standing spectators or 17,500 seated guests. The Sphere is expected to feature an insane 160,000-square-foot wraparound LED display on the interior, a 580,000-square-foot exterior LED display, and north of 150,000 speakers. </p><p>Speaking with CNBC host Scott Wapner last Thursday, Boyar boldly predicted \"it's likely\" that after construction on the MSG Sphere is completed, \"James Dolan, who controls the company, will sell the teams,\" - referring to both the Knicks and the Rangers. Boyar added that \"private equity has gotten involved in a big way.\" </p><p>https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/08/11/investors-need-to-beware-of-false-bargains-says-boyar-value-groups-jonathan-boyar.html</p><p>Monday evening, in response to a clip of the interview posted by @NBA_NewYork, the Boyar Value Group account tweeted that potential bidders for the franchises may include PE firms Silver Lake (a California-based investment group with more than $88 billion in combined assets under management - which also happens to be one of the top institutional shareholders of MSG Sports) and global investment titan KKR (Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co). Among other possible interested parties, Boyar points to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust (which also holds more than 500,000 shares of $MSGS) and Egyptian Billionaire Nassef Sawiris (who has a 5% stake in MSG Sports Corp and co-owns the Aston Villa Football Club with Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wes Edens).</p><p>As of this morning, Madison Square Garden Sports Corp stock ($MSGS) was trading north of $162, representing a 5% increase since Thursday. $MSGE is up nearly 4% over that same stretch.</p><p>\"Two things could happen in our opinion,\" Boyar forecasts, \"either a PE firm or a family office will take a minority stake in either the Knicks or the Rangers. Or there could be a sale of one or both of the teams. Too bad Steve Cohen is not a basketball fan!... At some point it would not surprise us if someone makes an offer for one or both of the teams.\"</p><p>However, plenty of pundits and financial analysts would be shocked if Dolan decided to cash out any time soon. Earlier this year, Dolan, the executive chairman of MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment, signed new contracts to remain in both roles. According to The Athletic, Dolan will be paid \"a minimum of $26.5 million annually for his roles with the two companies, based on a combination of base salaries and equity grants, with the possibility to earn annual bonuses targeted to be worth no less than 200% of those base salaries.\"</p><p>Per an SEC filing made by MSG Sports in 2021, the Dolan Family Committee - which consists of five family members - ensures that an \"approval of a change in control transaction must be approved by not less than all but one vote.\" According to The Athletic, each committee member gets one vote, except James Dolan, who gets two, \"which allows him to block any sale that would change who runs the company.\"</p><p>There have been rumors in the past that Dolan might put the team up for sale, but they have obviously never come to fruition. In an interview with ESPN's Ian O'Connor in December of 2018, Dolan said he had received \"feelers\" for the Knicks at around $5 billion but added, \"no one has come through with a bona fide offer\" for the team. A short time later, Dolan released a statement: \"As we have previously stated, there are no plans to sell the Knicks.\" </p><p>Holding onto the team has been a brilliant business decision by Dolan, which has, quite literally, paid dividends. </p><p>Earlier this month, according to an annual list published by Sportico, the Knicks were valued at $6.12 billion, making them the most valuable team in the NBA and the third most valuable in all of North America (behind only the Yankees and Cowboys).</p><p>Forbes also recently ranked New York as the NBA's most valuable franchise, noting the Knicks saw a whopping 67% increase in value from 2016 to 2021. And that's with the team posting a losing record in eight of their last nine seasons!</p><p>With the NBA set to sign a monstrous new TV deal (CNBC has reported the total value of the upcoming pact could be as much as $75 billion) in 2025, it's probably safe to assume Dolan would have to be beyond overwhelmed by an outlandish offer even to consider selling the team at any point in the near future. </p><p>UPDATE: After posting this piece, I received a prompt and direct response from an MSG executive regarding speculation that owner James Dolan might consider selling the Knicks or the Rangers:\"We have no plans to sell either of the teams.\"</p><p>What's on Tap with Tommy Beer is a reader-supported publication.

If the Knicks don't trade for Mitchell, their 2022-23 season may be determined by which version of Randle shows up.</p><p>If it's the All-NBA edition that busted his tail and shots lights out, New York has a chance to compete for a top-5 seed in the East. If it's the \"lackadaisical/thumb's down\" version we saw in 2021-22, the Knicks could end up missing the playoffs once again. </p><p>Not only is Randle the 'Bockers' highest-paid player, but he also led New York in field goal attempts and Usage Rate last season. When your team's most important player refuses to fight on the defensive end and is incredibly inefficient offensively, you're gonna lose more games than you win. </p><p>As I wrote in April, I think the Knicks' best course of action is parting with Randle. If his subpar production were the only issue, holding out hope he can rebound from a rough year would make plenty of sense. However, several concerns complicate the situation. The relationship between Randle and Knicks fans turned toxic at various points last season due mainly to his lack of effort and intensity. (Telling fans to \"shut the f–k up\" didn't help matters). </p><p>Just as importantly, Obi Toppin played the best ball of his career late in the year with Randle sidelined. While it's foolish to make too much out of relatively meaningless contests, it was impossible to watch Toppin fully unleashed and not recognize his tantalizing upside. It's also important to remember that Toppin will be due for a contract extension of his own soon, and the Knicks need to determine if he is worth a hefty investment. </p>\n      <p>\n          \n              Read more\n          \n      </p>",

Based on some unique research, KD said that Atkinson had earned his respect. </p><p>\"I was doing a lot of YouTube research on Kenny Atkinson and watching interviews to see how he talked after games and stuff,\" Durant told reporters. \"I really liked his approach to his craft as a coach and that's what drew me in pretty quickly. I didn't really do too much research on other coaches, so I guess he always had the leg up. But once I started to get comfortable with how he approaches his craft, it started to make me feel at ease even though I'd never had a conversation with him. I could just see through YouTube and the clips that he was pretty genuine about the game.\"</p><p>In an interview with WFAN that offseason, Nets GM Sean Marks said KD informed him that the culture the Nets had established under Atkinson and Marks was also a factor in his decision. \"I love the system. I love how you guys play,\" Durant said, according to Marks.\" We could never take you guys lightly … If we were up 10 with two minutes to go, we knew that didn't mean anything against Brooklyn.\" Added Marks: \"That's a real credit to the competitive environment that Kenny (Atkinson) has really brought.

        "description": "<p>The most recent installment in our \"The Top 75 Knicks of All Time\" series finished off with Earl Monroe at the 11th spot, which means we are about to enter the Top 10. </p><p>10. Allan Houston</p><p>Drafted 11th overall by the Pistons in the 1993 draft, Houston played three seasons in Detroit before hitting the free agent market in 1996 as a rising star. That summer, New York inked him to a seven-year deal worth around $55 million. Houston would replace John Starks as the team's starting shooting guard, with Starks serving as the squad's Sixth Man. Houston's picture-perfect form would be a mainstay in the Garden for the next nine years. </p><p>Houston will forever have a special place in the hearts of Knicks fans because he drove a stake through the heart of Pat Riley on May 16, 1999. With time winding down in the deciding Game 5 of the Knicks-Heat first-round playoff series, Houston curled off a screen, caught the pass and took a couple of dribbles before releasing a running one-hander from 16 feet. The ball danced on the front of the rim and bounced off the backboard before falling through the net with 0.8 seconds left on the clock. New York became just the second eighth seed in the history of the NBA to knock off a number one seed. That Knicks team would eventually advance all the way to the Finals, which is the last time the 'Bockers have scaled those heights. </p><p>Houston went to back-to-back All-Star games in 2000 and 2001 (the last New York guard to make an All-Star team!!) and is among Knicks' all-time leaders in several offensive categories. Houston ranks fourth on the franchise's all-time career scoring list, trailing only Patrick Ewing, Walt Frazier and Willis Reed. He is also second in three-point field goals. Unfortunately, Houston is also remembered for signing a $100 million contract with the Knicks in 2001 and subsequently being forced into retirement due to injury issues. </p><p>9. Carmelo Anthony</p><p>Ranking Melo is difficult, as he has played a majority of his career in Denver (564 career games as a Nugget vs. 412 as a Knick). Also, he enjoyed his greatest team success and playoff performances as a member of the Nuggets. Denver qualified for the postseason in each of his seven seasons. In contrast, the Knicks failed to make the playoffs in each of his final four years in New York. </p>\n      <p>\n          \n              Read more\n          \n      </p>",

As expected, Jones confirmed reports that Utah and New York haven't spoken recently, as neither side is willing to budge from their current positions. As I have noted, this should be considered welcomed news for Knicks fans, as it shows Leon Rose is content to remain patient and wait until Danny Ainge lowers his asking price. </p><p>However, Jones intimated New York would be amenable to trading away Obi Toppin but reported that among the young prospects on the Knicks roster, Quentin Grimes is Ainge's primary target. This is unsurprising for several reasons. First, Grimes played well as a rookie, as the 25th overall pick in the 2021 draft exceeded expectations right out of the shoot. Grimes then boosted his stock in Las Vegas last month, averaging a team-high 22.6 points, 4.2 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 1.2 steals and 3.4 made three-pointers while leading New York to the championship game.</p><p>Furthermore, unlike Immanuel Quickley or Obi Toppin, who are entering their third NBA season, Grimes is just one year into his rookie contract, meaning he won't sniff free agency until 2026. Grimes' base salary next season is $2.3 million and will rise to just $2.4 million in 2023-24.</p>\n      <p>\n          \n              Read more\n          \n      </p>",

        "description": "<p>On Wednesday, June 29th, 1994, the Knicks selected Charlie Ward with the 26th pick in the NBA Draft. </p><p>In late January of 1999, prior to the start of the lockout-shortened 99-00 season, the Knicks (on the same day they signed center Chris Dudley) re-signed point guard Ward to a five-year, $28 million contract. Incredibly, that's the last time New York signed one of their own first-round picks to a multi-year extension. </p><p>What's on Tap with Tommy Beer is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.</p><p>On July 1st, 2022, Rowan Barrett Jr. became eligible to sign an extension and snap a two-decades-long curse. (Mitchell Robinson, who signed a four-year deal last month, was a second-round selection.) </p><p>Three members of Barrett's draft class - Ja Morant, Zion Williamson and Darius Garland - have already inked max deals. Will Barrett become the fourth?</p><p>The Knicks have until October 17th, the day before the start of the 2022-23 season, to reach an agreement. Under a max extension (assuming he doesn't make an All-NBA team next season, which would bump his salary up to 30% of the cap), Barrett would earn $193 million over five years, beginning in 2023-24. </p><p>Here's what the annual breakdown of that max extension would look like:2023-24: $33,250,0002024-25: $35,910,0002025-26: $38,570,0002026-27: $41,230,0002027-28: $43,890,000</p><p>At first glance, those astronomical numbers may appear nonsensical for a player that has not yet sniffed an All-Star berth. However, providing context to those salary figures is vital, specifically as they relate to the rising salary cap. More on that in a bit; let's first talk about Barrett's value based on his production over the first three years of his NBA career. </p><p>Let's begin by noting Barrett just celebrated his 22nd birthday, and the counting stats he's been able to rack up over his first three pro seasons, at such a young age, are jaw-dropping and place him in elite company. Barrett is one of only five players in the history of the NBA to score more than 3,000 points, grab more than 1,000 rebounds, dish out more than 500 assists, and knock down more than 200 triples before turning 22 years old. The other four players in this exclusive club are LeBron James, Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, and Kobe Bryant.</p><p>And, based on traditional counting stats, Barrett took a significant step forward in 2021-22, averaging 20.0 points, 5.8 rebounds, 3.0 assists, and 2.0 made three-pointers per game. He took his game to another level in the second half of the season, playing his best ball as a 'Bocker. Over the first 20 games following the All-Star break, Barrett averaged a whopping 25.1 points, 6.3 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 0.9 steals and 2.0 made treys. </p><p>A key to RJ's success was his ability to carve his way through traffic and attack the tin. Only four players attempted more free throws over the second half of the season: Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Trae Young and James Harden. (RJ got to the line more often than Nikola Jokic, Kevin Durant and Luka Doncic.)</p><p>Barrett poured in 30+ points 11 times during the 2021-22 season, the most by any player age 21 or younger. LaMelo Ball and Anthony Edwards ranked second, with nine such games apiece. </p><p>However, the biggest knock on Barrett has been his inefficiency on the offensive end. And RJ regressed from an efficiency standpoint last season. After slashing 44/40/75% as a sophomore, Barrett shot just 40.8% from the floor, 34.2% from downtown and 71.4% from the charity stripe in 2021-22. To put those percentages in context: 32 NBA players averaged more than 17 field goal attempts per game in 2021-22, and of those 32 players, Barrett was one of only two to post an eFG% below 48%. (The other was his teammate, Julius Randle. Randle and Barrett were also the only two with a True Shooting percentage south of 53%.)</p><p>Consequently, Barrett's advanced analytics don't paint a pretty picture. Among players drafted in 2019, Barrett ranks 39th in VORP (just ahead of Romeo Langford), 16th in Win Shares and 24th in Box Plus/Minus (just behind Ty Jerome).  </p><p>Defensively, the Knicks allowed 111.6 per 100 possessions with Barrett on the floor last season. That number dropped to 105.4 with Barrett on the bench. To be fair, it's worth noting RJ spent much of his time playing alongside subpar defenders such as Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier, Julius Randle etc., but that's obviously not an overly encouraging statistic.</p><p>Similarly, Barrett's shooting struggles are impacted by frequently being forced to share the floor with players incapable of knocking down open shots or creating easy looks for teammates. </p><p>Looking at the big picture, the Knicks' hesitation to pony up max money is understandable. While Barrett's future is promising, handing him north of $190 million in guaranteed cash carries significant risk. In fact, if the league's salary cap wasn't set to skyrocket, playing hardball and refusing to offer him the full max would probably be the correct course of action. </p><p>However, given the trajectory of the cap and the league's future economic landscape, New York should do what it takes to lock up Barrett for the full five years possible. Here's why...</p><p>In October 2014, the National Basketball Association announced it had agreed to a nine-year, $24 billion television deal with ESPN and TNT. That deal, which was worth nearly three times as much as the league's previous pact, went into effect following the 2015-16 season. And, as a result, the summer of 2016 was insane.  </p><p>Due to the unprecedented influx of revenue, the NBA's salary cap jumped from $70 million to $94 million. Consequently, nearly every team in the league was flush with cash, which led to an unprecedented free agency frenzy. Not only did the cap increase enable Kevin Durant to infamously join Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Igoudala in Golden State, but it also led to many a mediocre player being vastly overpaid. </p><p>Each of the following players signed deals for north of $50 million in guaranteed salary that offseason: Timofey Mozgov, Evan Turner, Joakim Noah, Bismack Biyombo, Chandler Parsons, Kent Bazemore, Ryan Anderson, Marvin Williams, Allen Crabbe, Luol Deng, Ian Mahinmi, Solomon Hill. </p><p>Nicolas Batum, Hassan Whiteside, Mozgov, Parsons, and Turner inked contracts worth a combined total of $455 million. It was a truly wild time. </p>Tommy Beer @TommyBeerwhat was your favorite crazy 2016 free-agent signing??\n\nTIMOFEY MOZGOV: 4 years, $64 million\nNICOLAS BATUM: 5 years, $120 million\nCHANDLER PARSONS: 4 years, $94 million\nEVAN TURNER: 4 years, $70 million\nJOAKIM NOAH: 4 years, $72 million\nBISMACK BIYOMBO: 4 years, $72 million<p>August 2nd 2021</p>19 Retweets119 Likes<p>I bring up the lunacy of 2016 because the TV contract that went into effect back then is set to expire following the 2024-25 campaign. CNBC has reported the total value of the NBA's new TV deal could more than triple, from $24 million up to $75 billion.  </p><p>Therefore, pundits have predicted the league's salary cap, which is set at $123 million for the upcoming 2022-23 season, could rise as high as $175 million in 2025-26. </p><p>In 2016, the NBA's player union refused to incorporate a cap smoothing mechanism that would have seen smaller annual jumps to the salary cap. It's unknown if the NBPA will take that same approach this time around.</p><p>Either way, Barrett's remuneration for the final three years of his deal will look far more favorable post-2025 compared to the summer of 2022. Accounting for the rising cap, Barrett's annual salary will be far, far more palatable. </p><p>Consider this:A player earning $38 million next season will account for 30.7% of his team's total cap space in 2022-23. </p><p>Should the cap jump to $175 million in 2025-26, a player earning $38 million will account for less than 22% of his team's total space. </p><p>As Barrett's salary rises, the cap will do the same. Some analysts believe it will advance north of $200 by 2028, meaning free agents signing supermax pacts will make upwards of $70 million per season. </p><p>Thus, even if Barrett doesn't develop into an All-NBA stud or even an All-Star, his contact could still be considered team-friendly.</p><p>The Athletic's John Hollinger, a former front office executive for the Memphis Grizzlies, wrote about this dynamic last week, arguing that \"it seems virtually impossible to overpay\" a player like RJ Barrett \"at almost any price.\" Hollinger added that \"long-term extensions for players like Barrett, [Tyler] Herro and [Jordan] Poole seem like almost no-brainers given what's going to happen with the cap; first, because it's the only way to preserve extendability, and second, because a rising cap drains out so much of the risk.\"</p><p>While I wouldn't go so far as to call it a \"no-brainer,\" the impact of the changing economic landscape is indisputable. Given the financial forecasts, it's somewhat surprising that New York hasn't locked up Barrett already. </p><p>If the Knicks refuse to offer Barrett a max extension this offseason, he will become a restricted free agent in 2023. New York would, of course, still have the right to match an offer he receives on the open market. However, unless he suffers a catastrophic injury, plenty of teams with cap space will be willing to sign a 23-year-old RJ Barrett to a max offer sheet, especially given the abovementioned circumstances related to the rising cap. </p><p>While the Knicks can sign Barrett to a five-year deal, the most any other team can offer is four. Under different circumstances, a shorter deal might typically appeal to New York, considering their concerns. However, every team in the league should prioritize locking up young, promising players for as long as possible prior to the pending cap spike. </p><p>In fact, Holliger suggests that young guns such as Barrett and Herro might actually seek out shorter-term deals that would enable them to re-enter free agency in 2025 or 2026. </p><p>Due to these unique circumstances, there's not much benefit to New York dragging out these negotiations. One reason for holding off on an extension would be to include Barrett in a blockbuster trade for Donovan Micthell; however, it seems New York has let it be known that they are unwilling to include RJ in any package (which reportedly isn't a deal-break for Utah). </p><p>Barrett's agents are fully aware of what's on the horizon and will almost definitely demand the max. New York could draw a line in the sand and try to save a few million, but such a strategy could backfire. We saw what happened this summer with Deandre Ayton and Phoenix. The Suns ended up holding onto Ayton, but only after he signed an offer sheet with the Indiana Pacers. Could that result in some bad blood and tension between the player and the organization going forward?  </p><p>In addition to his remarkable skill set and tantalizing upside, one of Barrett's best attributes is his professionalism. The kid was drafted into the cauldron that is New York City as a teenager with the hopes of a franchise's fanbase on his back (RJ is the first Knick picked in the top-3 since Patrick Ewing in 1985) - and he hasn't made a misstep. Barrett has handled the public pressure incredibly well. In this day and age of social media, that's particularly impressive. Some athletes don't have what it takes to survive, let alone thrive, in NYC. Barrett has proven he can handle the bright lights of Broadway. That shouldn't be taken for granted. </p><p>And it's clear he feels he has much more to prove and hopes to do so in New York. </p><p>Asked about the possibility of an extension back in April, Barrett responded: \"I've said since Day One that this is where I wanna be. I didn't work out for any other team. This is where I wanna be. I love playing for the Knicks. I love playing in the Garden. I love how we got to the playoffs last year and looking to do that again. I love everything about being a Knick. Yeah, (this is) 100% the place I wanna be.\"</p><p>What's on Tap with Tommy Beer is a reader-supported publication.

        "title": "Leon Rose vs. Danny Ainge: Who Has Hand?",
        "link": "https://tommybeer.substack.com/p/leon-rose-vs-danny-ainge-who-has",
        "description": "<p>The fourteenth episode in the third season of the sitcom Seinfeld's illustrious run is entitled \"The Pez Dispenser.\"  </p><p>In this episode, written by the brilliant Larry David, George complains to Jerry that he doesn't have any \"hand\" in his relationship with his then-girlfriend, Noel. George explains how he's demoralized because the relationship means far more to him than his partner. He is completely smitten with Noel, while she seems somewhat detached. Consequently, George feels she has all the leverage in the relationship and is desperate to flip the balance of power. </p><p>George: I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand... How do I get the hand?</p><p>Jerry: We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.</p><p>The battle for \"hand\" is not limited to unhealthy romantic relationships. In every negotiation, each side endeavors to exert control over the other. Which brings us to the ongoing discussions between Danny Ainge, CEO of Basketball Operations for the Utah Jazz, and Leon Rose, president of the New York Knicks.  </p><p>The Knicks and Jazz are close to a deal for Donovan Mitchell. However, after talks ramped up earlier this month and it seemed a blockbuster trade was imminent, the momentum has slowed as both parties have inched away from the negotiating table. </p><p>Let's look at the lay of the land and examine which side is currently in the driver's seat, whether that could change over time, and the various factors working in favor of each side.</p><p>Why Ainge/Utah Has Hand:</p><p>The Knicks need a superstar. Period.</p><p>A month after firing his close friend Steve Mills in February of 2020, Madison Square Garden executive chairman James Dolan hired Leon Rose. One of the primary reasons Mills was let go was his inability to snag a superstar. In his pitch to Dolan during the interview process, Rose undoubtedly noted his close relationships with the game's greats. As the head of the basketball division at CAA Sports, Rose represented such All-Stars as LeBron James, Chris Paul, Joel Embiid, and Karl-Anthony Towns. And, yes, Donovan Mitchell. </p><p>The week Rose was hired, Mitchell endorsed the move. \"I think with Leon — who I know personally — things are going to trend upward. I love Leon to death,\" Mitchell said. \"He's a great dude, great person and a really good businessman. So I think they're going to start going in the right direction when he gets in there.\"</p><p>One of the primary reasons Dolan hired Rose was his belief that the former agent could use his unparalleled connections to accomplish something past regimes have been unable to achieve: Bring a marquee player to Madison Square Garden. The clock on his assignment began ticking almost as soon as Rose entered his new office. </p><p>Knicks fans know this, as does every executive in the NBA. So we know Ainge is well aware of the pressure on Rose to reel in a big fish. </p><p>Ainge is hoping to use that leverage to pilfer everything imaginable. According to Tony Jones of The Athletic, Utah initially asked for not only six future first-round draft picks but also all four of the Knicks' best young prospects (Quentin Grimes, Immanuel Quickley, Obi Toppin and Miles McBride). Keep in mind, Ainge just fleeced the Timberwolves ​​in the Rudy Gobert swap, walking away with an unprecedented haul of five first-rounders (three of them completely unprotected), a pick swap and multiple quality rotation players for a 30-year-old center. He is undoubtedly looking to get more for Mitchell, a more valuable asset.</p><p>And it's not inaccurate to assert that Ainge has time on his side. He's only been on the job eight months and has already pulled off one of the most lopsided trades in franchise history. Oh, and he's one of the league's most respected front office executives and a living legend in the state of Utah. It could be argued that no GM/team president in the NBA has more job security than Ainge. </p><p>On the other hand, the Knicks are coming off a terribly disappointing 2021-22 campaign in which they failed to qualify for even the Play-In Tournament, finishing at least eight games below .500 for the eighth time in the last nine years. Toward the end of this past season, it was rumored that head coach Tom Thibodeau was on the hot seat. Rose has decided to bring Thibs back for at least one more year, but if New York fails to live up to expectations in 2022-23, it won't be just the coach fearing for his job. New York is not an organization known for its stability or patience. Remarkably, no top executive has lasted more than four full seasons with the Knicks since Ernie Grunfeld in the 1990s. </p><p>Ainge, for good reason, is hoping that the longer this thing drags out, the more likely it is Dolan steps in and imprudently pushes it past the goal line, as he did during the Carmelo Anthony negotiations with Denver. Dolan is aware the tabloids would have a field day if Mitchell doesn't end up in orange and blue. The Knicks have precisely what Utah is looking for, and Mitchell is not only a CAA client, but he's from New York, and his father works for the Mets. If Rose can't seal the deal on a player that checks all those boxes, he'd be mocked. </p><p>Share</p><p>And the Knicks would obviously love to get their hands on Mitchell as soon as possible. Finalizing a trade with Utah would allow New York to begin the process of rounding out its roster. With Mitchell on board, Rose and company would likely look to part ways with Julius Randle. It's difficult to envision Randle, who has been the focal point of the Knicks' offense for three straight seasons, meshing successfully with a new backcourt of Mitchell (who posted a Usage Rate of 32.9% last season) and Jalen Brunson (who notched a career-high Usage Rate of 21.9% in 2021-22). Making all necessary moves during the summer would give New York's coaching staff plenty of time to game plan properly. </p><p>As for the Jazz, they are in no rush. Training camp is still two months away. In his post earlier this week, Shams Charania of The Athletic reported the Jazz \"are not operating with a sense of urgency and have the time to evaluate the best offers\" for Mitchell, who has three years left on his current contract. Shams added that Mitchell has not yet requested a trade or attempted to force his way out of Utah and that the organization will patiently \"continue to evaluate incoming calls.\" </p><p>Ainge clearly feels he has time on his side. </p><p>GEORGE: Jerry, let me tell you something, \"A man without hand is not a man.\" I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves!</p><p>However, that balance of power could shift as we head towards the fall. Leon Rose may spend the next couple of months imitating Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong and singing, \"Wake Me Up When September Ends.\"</p><p>Why Rose/New York Has Hand</p><p>For the reasons noted above, the Knicks would love to consummate this seemingly inevitable trade sooner rather than later. </p><p>However, as we inch closer to Media Day and the start of training camp, tension and pressure may begin to be diverted from Manhattan to Salt Lake City.   </p><p>Fortunately for Utah, Mitchell has yet to demand a trade publicly. It certainly wouldn't be surprising if we find out later that Ainge asked Mitchell to remain mum while he worked on a deal, promising to do right by the franchise's best player. However, might Mitchell's stance change once he starts suffering through loss after loss?</p><p>Remember, the Jazz have posted a .623 winning percentage since drafting Mitchell. They have won more games over the past five years than any other team in the Western Conference. However, over the last month, Utah has traded their starting small forward and center in exchange for draft picks, and their head coach quit. </p><p>Will Mitchell, who has advanced to the postseason every year of his career, be content suddenly surrounded by strangers on a team whose new primary focus is ping pong balls? </p><p>Earlier this month, Ainge hired 34-year-old Will Hardy as the team's new head coach. Hardy, who spent last season as an assistant in Boston, graduated from college in 2009. If Mitchell remains on the roster in late September, Hardy's first Media Day in Utah will be a circus. Whenever Mitchell meets with the press, he will be hounded with questions about his future. And Hardy, the NBA's youngest head coach, will be bombarded with queries about possible trades and other assorted distractions.</p><p>One way for Ainge to shield Hardy from that chaos would be trading Mitchell before the start of the camp. </p><p>As for Ainge's demands, it's crucial to note that he was able to rob Minnesota blind because he had significant leverage in negotiations. The Wolves wanted Gobert badly, but the Jazz didn't need to trade their star center. Ainge undoubtedly told Minnesota that if they weren't willing to meet his exorbitant demands, he would happily run it back with Rudy and Donovan as the cornerstones of a competitive team. It wasn't an outlandish plan considering Utah's success in recent seasons (they finished with the league's best record in 2020-21). </p><p>However, with Gobert now in Minnesota and Royce O'Neal in Brooklyn, two-fifths of Utah's starting lineup has been shipped out of Salt Lake. Ainge has shown his cards. It's become clear he's committed to ripping the roster down to the studs and embarking on a complete rebuild.  </p><p>Immediately after the Gobert deal was finalized, the Jazz front office leaked to every reporter possible that they planned to hold onto Mitchell and \"retool\" around him. But that was never a real possibility. Not only would they risk alienating Mitchell, which could potentially result in a public trade demand, but Ainge is too smart to anchor the franchise in no man's land (not good enough to make the playoffs but not bad enough to win the lottery). </p><p>Rose knows that Ainge is bluffing if he tries to play the \"we're extremely happy to hold onto Mitchell\" hand. </p><p>Subscribe now</p><p>Yes, Ainge could hold onto Mitchell and look to trade him at the deadline, but entering the season with Mitchell on the roster is a risky play by Ainge for multiple reasons, outside of the incessant distractions. First and foremost, if Mitchell suffered a severe injury, it would impact his value. In addition, having an All-Star in uniform dramatically increases the chances Utah hangs around .500, which decreases Utah's chances of landing Victor Wembanyama.</p><p>For those of you that haven't heard that name before, get used to it. You'll hear it often over the next 12 months. Wembanyama is a freakishly skilled 7-foot-3 Frenchman who many scouts consider the most talented prospect to enter the NBA since LeBron James in 2003. When the Spurs start tanking three months before the start of a season, you know there's a special prize in the following year's lottery. </p><p>How about this recent scouting report: \"Think Rudy Gobert mixed with Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis. That's what Wembanyama is projected to be. If you think that comp is too outrageous, then how about a larger Giannis Antetokounmpo without any weaknesses.\"</p><p>The projected No. 2 pick, point guard Scoot Henderson, would have likely been the top overall selection in this year's draft if he was eligible. Again, Ainge understands that stagnating in the middle of the standings is counterproductive. You go all in, one way or the other. </p><p>And although Mitchell is content to wait patiently for the situation to play out in July doesn't mean he's willing to waste a year of his prime. Once Utah starts losing night after night, his stance could shift sharply. If he demanded a deal, that would limit Ainge's leverage, especially if Mitchell said he wanted to relocate to only a handful of cities.</p><p>Mitchell and Durant are the only two stars on the block as of now, but that may change over the next few months. If another stud says he's unhappy in his current situation and requests a trade, New York could use their war chest of picks and players on the next shiny object up for grabs. Is it outrageous to think Jaylen Brown might make waves because he feels disrespected by the Celtics? </p><p>Looking at the big picture, it's clear that although Ainge is in the driver's seat at the moment, that may not be the case in the months ahead.</p><p>Consequently, Knicks fans should be happy Leon Rose has refused to meet Ainge's outlandish demands.</p><p>Would plenty of New Yorkers be upset if Mitchell weren't on the roster on opening night? Yes, but they'd also be excited about seeing what Brunson brings to the table while also watching the development of the team's exciting young core (IQ, Obi, Grimes, Barrett, Sims, Robinson, etc.). Furthermore, the future first-round picks that Ainge covets won't decrease in value as the season drags on. </p><p>Ainge holds the upper hand now, but that could change as the summer winds down.</p><p>GEORGE: No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?</p><p>NOEL: I ... am breaking up ... with you!</p><p>GEORGE: You can't break up with me. I've got hand.</p><p>NOEL: And you're going to need it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>I was upstate in the sticks for a family reunion this weekend, so I was relieved a blockbuster didn't go down while I was in the land of waterfalls and wonky wi-fi.</p><p>However, a Woj bomb detonated early Monday morning, shaking up the NBA a bit. At 2:31 AM, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski tweeted that the Celtics had emerged as a potential landing spot for Kevin Durant. A few hours later, Shams Charania of The Athletic reported that Boston recently offered All-Star Jaylen Brown as the centerpiece in a package for KD and \"have emerged as a real threat to acquire Durant.\"</p><p>In addition to Brown, The C's were willing to include Derrick White and a draft pick. Brooklyn rejected that proposal and countered by asking Boston to include Brown, Marcus Smart, draft picks and potentially one more rotation player. According to Shams, the Celtics are \"less inclined to include Smart along with multiple other players or pick assets, but the franchise is mulling over next steps on how to approach discussions.\"</p><p>Man, this is a fascinating situation on so many levels.  </p><p>The Nets entered last season as the heavy favorites to win the East and capture the NBA title. We know how that played out. </p><p>Meanwhile, it was the Celtics, who were below .500 in mid-January, who would represent the Eastern Conference in the Finals. The two best players on the C's are two players Boston drafted via picks they obtained in the infamous Kevin Garnett/Paul Pierce trade with Brooklyn. </p><p>Now, it seems possible Durant could end up in Beantown, with Brown (and Marcus Smart?) heading to BK? Craziness. And a reminder of why the NBA is a 24/7-365 obsession for so many of us.</p><p>Brown, who at 25 is eight years younger than KD, emerged as a legit stud in the 2022 playoffs. For what it's worth, consider this:</p><p>Durant's per-game averages in the first-round vs. Boston:26.3 points (on 38% shooting),5.8 rebounds,6.3 assists (vs. 5.3 turnovers),1.0 steals. </p><p>Brown's per-game averages in the first-round vs. Brooklyn:22.5 points (on 49% shooting),5.3 rebounds,4.3 assists (vs. 2.5 turnovers),2.5 steals </p><p>In the Finals, Brown was Boston's leading scorer (only Steph Curry scored more points in the six-game series), pouring 23.5 points per contest, to go along with 7.3 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 2.6 made three-pointers. </p><p>I assume the additional rotation player the Nets are looking to pry from Boston is Grant Williams, who emerged as a significant contributor during Boston's postseason run. Williams exploded for 27 points, seven triples, six rebounds, and two blocked shots in Boston's Game-7 victory over the Bucks in the semifinals. Williams has just one year left on his rookie contract. </p><p>A package of Brown, Smart, Williams and some draft capital would be a huge haul. Yet, this is Kevin Freakin' Durant we're talking about. The best offensive player of this generation and one of the greatest scorers the league has ever seen. </p><p>Even if Boston parted with Brown, Smart and Williams, they'd still have an incredibly impressive roster. </p><p>Their depth chart post-trade would likely look like this: PG: Malcolm Brogdon, Payton PritchardSG: Derrick White, JD DavisonSF: Jayson Tatum, Danilo GallinariPF: Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mfiondu KabengeleC: Robert Williams, Luke Kornet</p><p>That's a phenomenal starting five. And that's assuming they can't convince Boston to take White instead of Smart/White by including unprotected picks. </p><p>Depth would definitely be an issue for the Celtics, but they'd have open roster spots that could be filled by veterans willing to settle for the minimum. And you know plenty of guys would love to play alongside KD and Tatum on a championship favorite.  </p><p></p>\n      <p>\n          \n              Read more\n          \n      </p>",

        "description": "<p>As I have noted previously, a logical argument can be made against New York trading an excessive amount of draft picks and young players in exchange for Donovan Mitchell. Many sensible Knicks fans feel the juice is not worth the squeeze. And make no mistake, Danny Ainge will squeeze the organization for every possible drop. </p><p>However, assuming the Knicks aren't forced to give up everything (it's been reported New York has refused to include RJ Barrett in any package and declined Utah's initial offer requesting Grimes, IQ and Obi Toppin in addition to a bevy of first-rounders), capitalizing on an opportunity to acquire a 25-year-old three-time All-Star about to enter the heart of his prime is probably the best path forward for the franchise. </p><p>What's on Tap with Tommy Beer is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.</p><p>There are plenty of reasons why such a trade, despite the costs, is well worth the gamble. Below are a bunch of numbers to illustrate why:</p><p>* 28.3In the 39 playoff contests he's appeared in, Mitchell has averaged 28.3 points per game. That's the seventh-best playoff scoring average in NBA history. The only players to average more points in the postseason are some guys named Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Kevin Durant, Luka Doncic, Jerry West and LeBron James. During the 2020 playoffs, Mitchell averaged a league-high 36.3 PPG while shooting 53% from the floor, 52% from downtown and 95% from the free-throw line. The following postseason (on a bum ankle), he led Utah into the conference semifinals by averaging over 32 points a night to go along with 5.5 assists and 5.0 made three-pointers, while slashing 45/44/83%. He's the only player ever to average 5+ dimes and 5+ treys during a postseason run that advanced past the first round. Moral of the story: Mitchell is a f*ucking elite offensive weapon and is one of those rare players whose playoff numbers actually exceed his regular season production. </p><p>* 8,324Now, that's not to suggest Micthell's regular season stats are lackluster. In fact, through the 345 games he's played in, Mitchell has racked up a total of 8,234 points, 1,542 assists and 1,433 rebounds. Only five other players in NBA history have matched or exceeded those totals in those statistical categories through their first 345 career contests. Those five players are LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Pete Maravich, Dwyane Wade, and Oscar Robertson. Simply stated, Mitchell has pieced together one of the most impressive beginnings to a career the league has ever seen. </p><p>* .623It's important to note that Mitchell has not posted gaudy, empty-calorie numbers on terrible teams. Quite the contrary. In the five years since drafting Donovan Micthell, the Jazz have posted a regular season record of 243-147. Their .623 winning percentage is the highest among all Western Conference teams over the past five seasons. Utah is the only team in the West to have qualified for the playoffs each year since 2018. </p><p>* 1,007On the far opposite end of the spectrum, we find the Knicks. New York has lost a league-high 1,007 regular season games this century. Yes, they are the only team in the NBA to have tallied more than 1,000 defeats since the start of this current millennium. </p><p>* 8Over the last 20 years, the 'Bockers have won a grand total of eight playoff games. Yes, that's the fewest among all 30 teams. To put that number in perspective: The Knicks have the same number of postseason victories in New York since 2001 as the Supersonics have in Seattle - despite the fact the franchise abandoned the city in 2008.</p><p>* 3,349Dating this excruciating 20-year stretch, the Knicks have won only one playoff series. One. The last time they played in the second round of the postseason was May 18th, 2013 (Game 6 vs. Indiana). That's 3,349 days ago. (It's been 49 years, two months and 11 days since New York won a championship.)</p><p>* 11Uncharacteristically, recent front office regimes in New York have held onto all the franchise's future first-round picks. Current team president Leon Rose also has prioritized trading for other teams' first and second-round selections. Add 'em all up, and New York has a total of 11 first-round picks over the seven years, more than all but two teams in the league. The reason New York has shrewdly been stockpiling picks for the last few years is to flip them in exchange for a star if/when one is available via trade. </p><p>* $64,900,000Leading up to the summer of 2019, the Knicks focused on clearing as much cap space as possible in order to make a run at top-tier free agents. Players such as Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler and Kyrie Irving would all be up for grabs. To that end, New York traded away Kristaps Porzingis and the contracts of Tim Hardaway Jr. and Courtney Lee to clear nearly $65 million in cap space. As we know, KD and Kyrie chose Brooklyn. Kawhi ended up in Los Angeles with Paul George. Jimmy Buckets stayed in Miami. Back in 2010, New York pinned its hopes on landing LeBron James. The Knicks spent two years clearing out cap space, only to watch King James take his talents to South Beach. New York ended up settling for an injury-riddled Amar'e Stoudemire. These are just two examples of the Knicks wasting years praying for a pipe dream but ultimately regretting the decision. We've also seen superstars demand trades while still under contract, but New York hasn't had any luck in that department since Carmelo Anthony forced his way to MSG. Moral of the story: The presence of cap space does NOT guarantee a star will sign on the dotted line, and there's no telling when the next All-Star might demand to be moved. </p><p>* No. 2Some misguided pundits and talking heads on TV have preemptively criticized New York, claiming Leon Rose is trading \"the farm\" for Mitchell because the Knicks are convinced Mitchell is capable of putting the franchise on his back and carrying them to the promised land. That's not the case. Due primarily to his defensive deficiencies and small stature, Mitchell is not on the same level as the KDs, Kawhi's and other all-time greats that have proven they can be the best player on multiple title teams. Rose, Worldwide Wes, GM Scott Perry and the rest of the Knicks brass undoubtedly recognize this reality. Yet, although Donovan Mitchell isn't \"The Guy,\" he'd be an ideal No. 2 alongside a superstar of that ilk. Mitchell is the perfect \"Guy Next To The Guy.\" Mix in Jalen Brunson and RJ Barrett as complementary \"almost All-Star\" caliber players (with a possibly higher ceiling), and you have a team capable of competing consistently at a high level. History tells us you need at least two great players to contend for an NBA Championship. Adding them both simultaneously would be preferred, but if that's not possible, adding the first star becomes a prerequisite. The Knicks surely believe that adding Mitchell increases the chances of New York adding a stud to serve as, hopefully, the final piece to the puzzle. And having Robin in-house will likely help convince Batman to come to Gotham. (Keep in mind, the NBA's national television broadcast rights package expires in 2025. There have been reports the salary cap could skyrocket north of $170 million after the league signs a new multi-billion TV deal before the start of the 2025-26 season.)</p><p>* Zero No. 1'sAs noted above, the Knicks have lost more games than any team in the league over the past two decades. Yet, incredibly, they failed to win the Draft Lottery even once. In fact, New York hasn't even had a single pick inside the top 3. They have been just bad enough to miss the playoffs but not awful enough to be the worst team in the NBA. In the near future, it's hard to envision New York finishing a season with one of the league's worst records, even if they don't add Mitchell. A roster that features Brunson, Barrett, Evan Fournier, Julius Randle, Derrick Rose and the three-headed center monster of Mitch Rob, Hartenstein and Sims, along with a deep bench of young, hungry contributors, should enable the Knicks to at least qualify for the play-in tournament. If the Knicks front office were willing to commit wholeheartedly to an OKC/Houston-style tear-down and rebuild, the argument against trading for Micthell would be much stronger. But we know that's not happening anytime soon. </p><p>* $104 millionOne of the reasons I was hesitant about the Knicks ponying up near-max money for Brunson was the pressure that would come along with being considered a savior of sorts in NYC. Knicks fans have been desperate for a competent starting point guard since the first G.W. Bush administration (it's been 20+ years since the Knicks sent a guard to the All-Star Game, when ​​Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell represented New York in 2001.) New Yorkers likely would have placed outsized expectations on Brunson, a player incapable of truly moving the needle by himself. However (in addition to signing Brunson for a bit less than expected and structuring the contract in a team-friendly fashion), bringing in Mitchell would make the Brunson signing almost an afterthought. This would allow Brunson to settle in and do what he does best without attempting to play outside himself to live up to a hefty contract. Yes, there would be well-justified and obvious concerns on the defensive end if NY rolls out a backcourt featuring a pair of 6'1 guards in Brunson and Micthell. However, Mitchell would replace Evan Fournier, who no one will confuse with a young Sidney Moncrief or Alvin Roberston. We also know that Brunson is capable of excelling next to a ball-dominant guard. He's proven as much playing alongside Luka Doncic in Dallas the past few seasons. Lastly, it could also be argued that trading for Mitchell makes signing Barrett to a massive extension more palatable. Locking up Barrett at max (or, preferably, near-max) money makes more sense with a core of JB, DM and RJ in place. </p><p>* 12.4Mitchell was devastating in pick-and-rolls this past season, averaging 12.4 points per contest as the ball-handler in P&amp;R situations. That ranked second-best in the NBA in 2021-22, behind only Trae Young and ahead of Luka Doncic and Ja Morant, who rank third and fourth, respectively. Among those four, Mitchell posted the highest effective field goal percentage (53.8%). Having a player who can attack defenses out of pick-and-rolls is critical for New York under coach Tom Thibodeau, who relies heavily on P&amp;R action. </p><p>* 914914 is the area code for Westchester, the New York county directly north of the Bronx and Manhattan. Donovan Mitchell was born and raised in Elmsford, a town in Westchester. His father, Donovan Mitchell Sr., works for the New York Mets as the club's Director of DEI and Player Relations. The younger Mitchell is a huge Mets fan and spends much of his offseasons in and around NYC. There is also a familial connection between Donovan and the Knicks organization. New York team president Leon Rose served as Mitchell's agent before leaving CAA to join the Knicks' front office. Rose's son, Sam, now reps Donovan. Mitchell also has a very close relationship with Knicks assistant Johnnie Bryant, who mentored Mitchell during his days in Utah before joining head coach Tom Thibodeau's staff. </p><p>* 2025Mitchell still has three seasons left on his current contract, meaning whichever team trades for him will have him under control through at least the end of the 2024-25 campaign (he has a player option for 2025-26). Of course, New York would look to ink him to an extension as soon as possible (and we can assume Micthell would be amenable to such a deal), but knowing that he's locked up limits any potential drama in the near future. And because he signed his rookie extension with the Jazz in 2020, his contract is relatively affordable. Mitchell will earn $30.3 million next season, making him the 35th highest-paid player in the NBA, just behind Michael Porter Jr. and Deandre Ayton and just ahead of Gordon Hayward. </p><p>* 1996That's the year Donovan Micthell was born. Of all the numbers listed above, this may be the most important. At just 25, Mitchell has already accomplished a great deal on the NBA level but has yet to enter the prime years of his career. What is his ultimate ceiling? Blessed with an incredible combination of athleticism, quickness and a 6'10\" wingspan, can he become a solid defender? Is he capable of leading the league in scoring at some point in his career? Acquiring a player like Micthell in his mid-20s gives the Knicks a long runway and plenty of opportunities to construct an elite roster with him as a centerpiece while he's still at the top of his game. </p><p>Moral of the story: The Knicks have waited a very long time to bring a young superstar to Madison Square Garden. Such a star is currently up for grabs, and not only is he a New York kid whose father works for the Mets, but he's a CAA client. And, just as importantly, the Knicks have precisely what the Jazz are searching for. We can get into the details of what it will take (Leon Rose, at least for now, is smartly playing hardball to avoid getting fleeced), but it sure seems the stars have aligned to bring Donovan Mitchell home.</p><p>What's on Tap with Tommy Beer is a reader-supported publication.

        "description": "<p>When a franchise hasn't won a championship of any kind in the previous 49 years, two months and nine days, you can excuse the fanbase for getting overly excited about a relatively meaningless summer league game played in mid-July in Las Vegas.  </p><p>So, yes, Knicks fans were amped up for Sunday's matchup with the Portland Trail Blazers. Unfortunately, they came away disappointed as the Blazers captured the Summer League chip by beating New York 85-77 in the title game. </p><p>New York's defense was up to the task on Sunday, holding Portland to just 85 points. However, their offense sputtered badly. The Knicks shot only 40% from the floor and knocked down just six of their 24 three-point attempts. </p><p>The Blazers' game plan was evident right from the opening tip; they were going to run double and even triple-teams at New York's best player, Quentin Grimes, and dare someone/anyone else to beat them. It was a smart strategy, as they limited the 'Bockers' top gun, and none of Grimes' teammates made Portland pay for their overly aggressive trapping strategy. </p><p>Grimes scored 19 points in the contest but took 16 field-goal attempts to get there. He finished the game shooting 5-of-16 from the floor, including a disappointing 2-of-11 from downtown. Grimes also added three rebounds, three assists and one steal in 33 minutes. His assist total could have (should have) been higher, but his teammates could not convert a few of the quality dimes he dropped.</p>Tommy Beer @TommyBeerBusta Grimes <p>July 17th 2022</p>37 Retweets676 Likes<p>Miles McBride was New York's second-leading scorer, tallying 17 points to go along with six rebounds, three assists (vs. two turnovers), two three-pointers and a steal, but he also was inefficient offensively. Deuce converted just four of his ten shots from the field, although he was able to knock down all seven of his free-throw attempts. </p><p>However, McBride played his worst defensive game of the summer in this contest. Portland's point guard, Brandon Williams, dominated Deuce. Williams finished with 22 points (on 5-o-f9 shooting), five assists (vs. only one turnover) and three rebounds. It was a surprising turn of events that dramatically impacted the game and the ultimate outcome. </p><p>Jericho Sims again played aggressively and with confidence. His final stat line (10 points, four boards, three assists, three steals and a block) doesn't jump off the page, but it's impossible to have watched Sims these past two weeks and not get excited about his future. We knew the athleticism and rim-running capability were there, but the big man showed an expanded offensive repertoire and looked the part of a reliable rotation-ready NBA center.</p><p>Feron Hunt wrapped up an up-and-down Summer League with an up-and-down final game. Hunt tallied 10 points (on 4-of-10 shooting), seven rebounds, two assists, two steals and three turnovers in Sunday's loss. As expected, he interspersed a few highlight plays with a few boneheaded turnovers. His body language on the court also leaves a lot to be desired. Defensively, Hunt could not control Trendon Watford, who finished with 19 points, seven rebounds, two assists and three steals. Watford was named the MVP of the championship game.</p>\n      <p>\n          \n              Read more\n          \n      </p>",

        "description": "<p>Written by Adia Harvey Wingfield, Washington University in St. Louis</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you heard of Jaz Brisack, Liz Fong-Jones and Chris Smalls?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those names might not be familiar to all Americans, but their recent accomplishments amount to a potential sea change in labor rights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As union organizers or advocates for better work conditions at some of the biggest and most powerful companies in the world – Starbucks, Google and Amazon, respectively – these three young people have highlighted just how far out of whack the balance between workers and organizations has grown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that their work, part of a surge in labor organizing and other kinds of community-building efforts, has its roots in the scholarship and journalism of Barbara Ehrenreich, who died on Sept. 1, 2022.</p>\n\n\n\nOpening a window on inequality\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ehrenreich is best known for her 2001 book “Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It begins with a deceptively simple premise: investigating whether and how workers can live on what they earn from low-wage jobs. Operating essentially undercover by taking on retail jobs, cleaning houses and waiting tables, Ehrenreich chronicled her experiences and observations as she roved from Florida to Maine to Minnesota. She showed readers that it was virtually impossible to make a living with this work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once hired, Ehrenreich refused to rely on her savings or assets, instead paying for rent, food and utilities out of her hourly wages. She quickly found out that doing so left her uninsured, in poor health, sometimes hungry, often tired and always struggling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Nickel and Dimed” is an unforgettable best-selling expose that highlights what many low-wage workers already know: It’s impossible to get ahead when you can’t even break even.</p>\n\n\n\nA model for sociologists\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I first read “Nickel and Dimed,” one of 21 books she published in her lifetime, in 2002 when I was finishing my coursework for a doctorate in sociology. Ehrenreich’s work resonated with me because of her focus on the grind of low-paying jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She earned her own doctorate in cell biology and had no formal training as a sociologist. But she adopted what I like to think are the strengths of my discipline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is, she asked questions to help understand various groups’ experiences, as well as the relationships between institutions and individuals. She also forcefully recommended policy changes that could potentially improve the lives of people who are suffering due to powerful forces, such as corporations, the government and school systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my view, Ehrenreich’s ability to document in clear, accessible prose exactly how low-wage work forced people into an unavoidable grind is the best kind of sociological research.</p>\n\n\n\nOpening a path\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her work also set an example for many other sociologists studying workers, labor markets and the economy. Ehrenreich laid a clear path for sociologists who have examined the inner lives of employees, the obstacles they face and the strategies they use to survive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subsequent studies of how autoworkers try to thrive in a declining industry, why workers blame themselves when they struggle to find employment, or of the relationship between union decline and pay differences for Black and white workers – all of that research followed Ehrenreich’s lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This body of work can push people to look at the consequences of these economic arrangements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also casts light on how “right to work” laws hamper union operations in 27 states. In addition, this research is scrutinizing short-term, contract work without job stability or benefits. The growth of gig work is adding to the gap between “good jobs” and “bad jobs,” and those with the bad ones are suffering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This research, like much of Ehrenreich’s work, forces readers to ask why economic inequality has become so severe in the U.S., with wages stagnating while wealth concentrates among those with the most.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>'While there are countless articles profiling Smalls, few have acknowledged the long history of Black labor leaders taking the helm of workers' rights movements.'https://t.co/l2UVoWMleL</p>— Mark Anthony Neal (@NewBlackMan) April 8, 2022\n\n\n\n\nNew generation of labor leaders\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brisack, Fong-Jones and Smalls, along with countless less prominent workers, know these things already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smalls built a labor movement at Amazon based on his and other workers’ demands that the company do a better job protecting them from COVID-19 at the warehouse where he had been employed on Staten Island, New York. In April 2022, the National Labor Relations Board certified that the workers had prevailed in their efforts to form the first union to represent any of Amazon’s workers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brisack, likewise, objected as a Starbucks barista in Buffalo, New York, to what she said were hazardous workplace conditions that heightened employees’ exposure to COVID-19. In December 2021, the campaign she organized led her workplace to become the first of the company’s nearly 10,000 locations to be represented by a union. By the end of August 2022, some 230 Starbucks stores had voted to unionize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fong-Jones, a former Google engineer who resigned and became an activist who supports the rights of women, trans people and people of color in tech industries, hasn’t unionized her former coworkers.

        "description": "<p>The ‘love letter to the movies’ genre is revived in this poignant, wonderfully acted drama about love, life and films</p><p>The “love letter to the movies” is a tricky genre, teetering on maudlin industry indulgence; my own rule is that any film, on any subject, if it is any good, is already a love letter to the movies. The template tends to be melancholy and bittersweet, a ruin-porn lament for nearly empty theatres and nearly lost youth. Maybe in the future there will be films that are love letters to streaming: sad films showing people watching TV screens that are blank except for the single title card declaring that the streamer has gone broke due to unsustainable debt … before thoughtfully wondering what is on at the cinema.But Sam Mendes, making his first solo outing as a writer as well as director, has taken the style and substance of this form and revived it with an engrossing, poignantly observed and beautifully acted drama about love, life and the fragile art of moviegoing – starring Olivia Colman and wonderfully shot by Roger Deakins. And he does it with all the more urgency now that cinema is under threat again after Covid. This film takes something from the tenderness and sadness of movies like The Smallest Show on Earth or Cinema Paradiso or The Last Picture Show – adding maybe a little bit of the lonely disquiet of Chantal Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman. But Mendes brings his own distinctive sense of personal drama, his adroit handling of actors and his sweet tooth for catchy jukebox slams, a style I remember from his American Beauty. Here we get invigorating blasts of Dylan’s It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding) and Joni Mitchell’s You Turn Me on I’m a Radio.A depressed cinema manager called Hilary, marvellously played by Colman, works at a (fictional) cinema called the Empire on the Margate seafront in 1981 as Britain swan-dives into recession, unemployment and widespread racism. Hilary is conscientious, with a real dedication to her job: selling tickets, checking receipts, cleaning the auditorium after the show. The people who work at the Empire are family – of sorts – with a grumpy and pompous manager, Mr Ellis (Colin Firth), dedicated projectionist Norman (Toby Jones) and assistants Neil (Tom Brooke) and Janine (Hannah Onslow). But Hilary, who lives alone, and who appears to be in treatment for some undiscussed breakdown the year before, is sliding further into unhappiness, made worse by her toxic relationship with a smugly uncaring married man who says hideously unsexy things during the act itself (“Your arse feels so good in my hands”). And Hilary has a gloomy connoisseurship of the cinema building itself, whose corridors she wanders. The Empire has had to close two of its four screens and the entire upstairs bar due to falling box office receipts: and Hilary is one of the few people who know about this secret, pigeon-infested ghostship chamber of emptiness.</p><p>But then the Empire hires a new ticket-seller: Stephen (played with emotional openness and sympathy by Micheal Ward), a young Black man who has an instant connection with Hilary: their relationship blossoms, but the nature of Hilary’s sadness rises alarmingly to the surface.There are some wonderful set-piece scenes in Empire of Light: everyone, especially the self-important Mr Ellis, is thrilled at the news that the cinema is to get a special regional premiere of that summer’s smash-hit, Chariots of Fire, with loads of dignitaries present – but the big night is marred by a terrible scene that Hilary makes out in the foyer, once the film has begun, which is made more painfully surreal and hilarious by the unmistakable sounds of Vangelis’s electronic theme tune in the background as the shouting commences. There are some other films of the era getting shown, but perhaps it is appropriate that the Empire is showing Being There, starring Peter Sellers, one of his last films and his return to form. (I found myself remembering Sellers’ grim recollection that most of his 70s movies were so unpopular, cinemas would put them on if they needed the auditorium to be empty so they could vacuum-clean it.)Empire of Light is a sweet, heartfelt, humane movie, which doesn’t shy away from the brutality and the racism that was happening in the streets outside the cinema: the Empire is showing Stir Crazy starring Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, directed by Sidney Poitier – a message of diversity, if 1981 Britain cared to listen. It’s clearly a labour of love for Sam Mendes: love requited.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>The spring acquisition has been one of the elite catchers in the game, and should be the undisputed starter.</p> <p>Y’know how, every once in a while someone comes along, that you didn’t know you needed in your life until they were there? Maybe it’s that friend you stumbled into at a college party who for the last 20 years has helped you move and been a godparent for your child, maybe it’s that really amazing professor that put you on a completely different path in life. For me, that person is Jose Trevino.</p>\n<p>In February if you had asked me who Jose Trevino is, I probably could have guessed he was a baseball player since I don’t know why random people would ask me about whether I recognize a specific name unless it was about baseball, but that’d be it. Now, I think he’s an indispensable part of the Yankee roster, and frankly should have played in more games:</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>Trevino’s one of the five or so most valuable catchers in baseball, despite playing 15-20 games fewer than his contemporaries like J.T. Realmuto, Sean Murphy, Will Smith, and Alejandro Kirk. Part of this is that he doesn’t necessarily hit as well as those other guys — Smith, for example, has played 18 games at DH because he has a wOBA 50 odd points higher than Trevino — but he should be behind the plate more.</p>\n<p>Part of this playing time problem is due to bad luck — he was clearly playing through at least one injury, if not multiple, in August — and happy news, the birth of his child this weekend necessitating his time away from the field. With his return coming tomorrow against Boston, and the team in much more a division fight than we’d all like, he needs to assume a starter’s workload down the stretch.</p>\n<p>There are 21 games left this season. It’s very rare that teams ask their starter to catch a day game after a night game, and there are three such games left this season — next Sunday at Milwaukee, the 24th versus the Red Sox, and October 1st against the Orioles. Those three, plus one of the games in the doubleheader in the Rangers series, go to Kyle Higashioka. If the division or homefield are decided, we can give Higgy the final game of that Rangers series.</p>\n<p>The remaining games, 16 or 17 of them, need to have Jose behind the plate. Every win matters with how the Yankees have seen their division lead get whittled away, and not only has Trevino been one of the most impressive surprises of this Yankee season, but Higgy has seen a pretty significant step backward.</p>\n<p>He’s still a capable framer, although he’s gone from one of the best in the game to merely good — even on a per-pitch basis, he’s been worth about three runs per 3000 pitches. If you take the per-pitch rate of the five best framers in the game, they’re worth about 11 runs per 3000. He has gotten much better at controlling the run game — his 43 percent caught stealing rate is by far the best of his career — but both the framing and his offensive stagnation make him the platonic ideal of the backup.</p>\n<p>Then there’s that other side to Trevino, the one that’s harder to prove. He just seems to get pitchers in a way that most catchers don’t. In four months, he’s ascended to the level of Adley Rutschman or Yadier Molina, where his relationships with his staff seem to be more important, and more beneficial, to the team’s success than quantifiable metrics — but those metrics, especially defensively, make him one of the three or four best catchers in baseball. The Yankees need a workhorse, and for the final weeks of the season, need to let Trevino work like a horse.</p>",

        "link": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/voting-restrictions-coffee-county-georgia",
        "description": "<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>This article first appeared at ProPublica, co-published with Gray TV. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For nearly 10 hours on Georgia’s primary day, Olivia Coley-Pearson tracked down every potential voter she could find, working two cellphones as she paced the parking lot outside the polls, repeating the same message: “You need to tell all your cousins, your brothers, your sisters, your aunts, your uncles — everybody you know — to come on down here to vote.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A third of her neighbors in Coffee County struggle to read at a basic level, and she wanted to make sure they had help navigating their ballots. In the late afternoon, she slid behind the sparkly pink steering wheel of her SUV for her final push of the day, heading down a long stretch of road where buildings gave way to fields and thickets of pine. She turned in to the Kinwood Estates mobile home park and stopped at the edge of a familiar dirt driveway just as Shondriana Jones, 30, bounded down the steps of a trailer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I can’t find my ID and Mama, she’s still at work,” Jones said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coley-Pearson has helped the family vote for years — she’s known them since she and Jones’ mother, Sabrina Fillmore, were young. Now 60, Coley-Pearson serves as a city commissioner in Douglas, the majority-Black county seat. Fillmore, 54, works at the local poultry plant cutting chickens. Neither Fillmore nor her daughter can read beyond a first-grade level, but they rarely miss an election, believing their votes can influence everything from their electricity costs to the way police treat them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coley-Pearson urged Jones to track down a utility bill to prove her identity at the election office just as Fillmore returned from a 10-hour shift, exhausted. With the women aboard, Coley-Pearson started the car, anxiety brewing in her mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though federal law guaranteed the two women the right to have someone help them vote, Coley-Pearson knew too well that this right was under attack. For all of the recent uproar over voting rights, little attention has been paid to one of the most sustained and brazen suppression campaigns in America: the effort to block help at the voting booth for people who struggle to read — a group that amounts to about 48 million Americans, or more than a fifth of the adult population. ProPublica analyzed the voter turnout in 3,000 counties and found that those with lower estimated literacy rates, on average, had lower turnout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“How the system is set up, it disenfranchises people,” said Coley-Pearson, who blames Southern political leaders for throwing up hurdles. “It’s by design, I believe, because they want to maintain that power and that control.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conservative politicians have long used harsh tactics against voters who can’t read — poor, often Black and Latino Americans who have been failed by the U.S. education system and who conservatives feared would vote for liberal candidates. Some states have required voters who needed help to sign an affidavit explaining why they need assistance; some have prevented voters who couldn’t read from bringing sample ballots to the polls and limited the number of voters that a volunteer could help read a ballot. Time and again, federal courts have struck down such restrictions as illegal and unconstitutional. Inevitably, states just create more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last two years, the myth of election fraud, supercharged by former President Donald Trump in the wake of his 2020 loss, has fueled a barrage of new restrictions. While they do not all target voters who struggle to read, they make it especially challenging for voters with low literacy skills to get help casting ballots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, Georgia passed a law limiting who can return or even touch a completed absentee ballot. Florida expanded the radius around election locations in which volunteers are prohibited from asking people if they need help. Texas passed a law prohibiting voters’ assistants from answering questions or paraphrasing complicated language on the ballot; a federal judge struck down several sections of the law in June. But the court left other provisions in place, including ones that increase penalties for helping voters who don’t qualify and require people who assist voters to fill out more paperwork. Texas did not appeal the decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To appreciate the impact of voter suppression, consider that recent elections have been determined by a narrow sliver of the electorate:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite losing the popular vote, Trump secured the presidency in 2016 by winning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan by a margin of just under 80,000 total votes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Joe Biden prevailed in 2020 by winning Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin by just over 40,000 votes combined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coley-Pearson recognizes the importance of this moment for Georgia, which is no stranger to close elections. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp faces another challenge from Democrat Stacey Abrams, and Sen. Raphael Warnock is attempting to hold on to his seat in a race that could tip the Senate back to Republican control. But to Coley-Pearson, helping people vote isn’t only about politics or even just about their rights as individuals. It is about the future of democracy at a time when it seems like the views of the majority are being marginalized by the actions of the few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a child in the 1970s, she’d watched as her mother, Gladys Coley — who stood just above 5 feet and had only an eighth grade education — rose to the helm of the local NAACP and challenged the discriminatory school system and police department. Her mother begged her not to return from college in Atlanta, but Coley-Pearson wanted to fight for the people of Coffee County, too. As she headed to the polls on primary day this past May, though, she couldn’t subdue her fear that by helping Jones and Fillmore, she was putting a target on her own back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of several years, she’d become tangled in an investigation of supposed voter fraud, which took aim at her attempts to assist voters who requested help. She had pleaded her case to television cameras and at a hearing before the state’s highest election official. She had even wound up in jail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Intimidation is real,” Coley-Pearson said. “If we don’t continue to vote, they’re going to have us right back where it used to be.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Coley-Pearson was born in an era when Southern states forced convoluted literacy tests on voters to keep Black people out of the polls. In those days, local voting officials often made exceptions for white people who couldn’t read. In 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act prohibiting racial discrimination at the polls. That didn’t stop white conservatives, especially in the South, from continuing to discriminate against voters with low literacy skills, who, due to centuries of oppression, were disproportionately Black.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conservatives argued that removing barriers for voters who couldn’t read would allow the federal government to overrule states’ decisions on how to run local elections and would hand more votes to liberal candidates. Clearly, they said, voters with low reading skills would be easily swayed by anyone assisting them, leading to rampant fraud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Today the bureaucrats are issuing certificates to vote to people who cannot read the ballot nor even the instructions on a ballot or on a voting machine,” segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace declared in late 1965. “The left wing liberals need as many illiterates as they can get to vote in order to keep them in power.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 1981, voters of color, including those with low literacy levels, still faced “white resistance and hostility,” according to a U.S. Commission on Civil Rights report. “For many minority voters, the kind of assistance that they receive at the polls determines whether they will vote,” the report stated. “If minority voters who do not speak English or who are illiterate receive inadequate assistance, they may become too frustrated and discouraged to vote or they may mark their ballots in such a way that they will not be counted.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Congress amended the Voting Rights Act in 1982 to affirm that voters who need help due to an “inability to read” could bring someone, other than their employer or union representative, to assist them in the voting booth. A string of subsequent lawsuits shows this federal action again failed to eradicate the discrimination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a 2001 case, the federal justice department claimed that white poll managers in Charleston County, South Carolina, were intimidating Black voters who requested assistance. According to testimony given in the case, the poll workers launched a barrage of questions at these voters, such as, “Can’t you read and write? And didn’t you just sign in? And you know how to spell your name, why can’t you just vote by yourself? And do you really need voter assistance?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A federal judge found that there was “significant evidence of intimidation and harassment,” but said evidence of the mistreatment was too “anecdotal” to take direct action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2012, the chairman of Coffee County’s board of elections filed a complaint against Coley-Pearson and three other residents, alleging that they’d assisted voters who didn’t legally qualify for help. Georgia law only allows voters to receive assistance if they are disabled or cannot read English. The secretary of state’s office, then under Kemp’s leadership, initiated an investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following summer, a 52-year-old line cook named Alvin Williams answered his phone to find a state investigator on the other end. The man had questions about the 2012 election. “It looks like you were assisted by Olivia Pearson,” said state investigator Glenn Archie, in a recording obtained by ProPublica. (Archie did not respond to a request for comment.) “It’s not marked why she assisted you and I was wondering why you needed assistance.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tone of the man’s voice made Williams nervous. “Because I can’t read. I’m illiterate,” Williams told Archie. He’d dropped out of school at 16 to work full time catching chickens and selling them to the local poultry plant, a job he’d skipped classes for since he was 11 to help support his family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m sure she read the candidates to you,” Archie said. “Did you get to pick the people you wanted to vote for?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Yes, sir,” Williams said. “I can’t read. That’s why she was helping me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“That’s no problem,” the investigator assured him. “She can assist you if you have problems reading.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the call left Williams humiliated and fearful of how his vote could be used against him or Coley-Pearson. “I don’t fool with the law,” he said in a recent interview. “And I don’t do nothing for them to fool with me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some other voters told investigators that they had requested and received help even though they could read. The investigation found that Coley-Pearson and the other volunteers neglected to verify whether some voters qualified for help and incorrectly filled out forms indicating why voters needed assistance. It also found that election workers failed to include required information on many forms and turned them in without making sure they were accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testifying at a 2016 hearing chaired by Kemp, Coley-Pearson maintained that she hadn’t broken any laws. In response to a poll worker’s claim that she’d touched the voting machine, Coley-Pearson said she’d merely accompanied voters who had requested her assistance and stood by to answer questions about the process or read names on the ballot. She said she followed the instructions of the poll workers, signing forms when directed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If someone asks me for help, I felt an obligation to try to assist if I could,” she testified at the hearing, stressing that she never told anyone who to vote for. Coley-Pearson suspected there was a deeper significance to the investigation and told the board, “Sometimes things are done to try to maybe dis-encourage, or whatever, other people from voting, and I don’t feel like that is fair.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state election board chose not to recommend her case for criminal prosecution, but a local district attorney’s office prosecuted her anyway, which made national headlines in BuzzFeed. It charged her with two felonies for improperly assisting a voter and for signing a form that gave a false reason for why a voter needed assistance. The trial ended with a hung jury. One of two Black people on the jury told a local reporter that she was the only holdout; everyone else voted to find Coley-Pearson guilty. She was tried again in a nearby county and, after about 20 minutes of deliberations, the new jury acquitted her of all charges. The district attorney’s office did not respond to ProPublica’s emailed questions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Three other volunteers took plea deals in which they admitted to making false statements on forms indicating the reason that a voter needed assistance; in exchange, they got probation, after which any fines would be waived. One of them, James Curtis Hicks, said that if he had fought his case and lost, he could have faced jail time or a mountain of fines. He didn’t want to take any risks. “Around here, to me, they target the leaders, the people that are standing up for the rights of the minority,” he said in a recent interview. “To shut me and Ms. Pearson down, it would stop a whole lot of people going to the polls.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, the 59-year-old truck driver had kept tabs on Coffee County voters to see if they needed help reading the ballot. But after the settlement, he stopped. “I didn’t want a focus on me to suppress anyone else,” he said. “I really felt intimidated.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the charges didn’t deter Coley-Pearson.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Before Jones could vote that May afternoon, she needed to get temporary identification. Dodging the pouring rain, she and Coley-Pearson scuttled into the elections office shortly before it closed. At nearly 6 feet tall, Coley-Pearson towered over the woman sitting behind a plexiglass barrier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She needs a voter ID, sweetie,” Coley-Pearson said, leaning in. The woman handed Jones an application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You need me to do it, baby?” Coley-Pearson asked softly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jones nodded, “Yes, ma’am.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The woman at the counter emphasized that Jones had to complete it on her own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She has trouble reading and writing,” Coley-Pearson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a tense moment, the woman agreed that Coley-Pearson could fill out the form. She read the questions out loud and filled in Jones’ answers, pointing out which lines to sign and date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jones is in the third generation of her family that is not able to read. Her grandmother never learned how, and her mother, Fillmore, left high school in her sophomore year, after frequently being disciplined for fighting. As an adult, Fillmore briefly attended an education program to help her learn how to read, but she felt discouraged and left.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jones graduated from high school in Coffee County but says she reads at the same first-grade level as her mother. She remembers attending special education classes with more field trips than written assignments and says teachers never diagnosed her with a learning disability or gave her one-on-one assistance. School administrators also frequently suspended her for fighting, she said. “They were trying to get rid of me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coffee County has long failed to provide an equal education for students of color. In 1969, federal officials sued its school board for refusing to integrate white and Black schools. Even after the school system was integrated, Black students continued to receive fewer academic resources and harsher punishments than their white peers. A decade ago, the district acknowledged its shortcomings in reading instruction and the need to rectify its problems with literacy, which were more pronounced for Black students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The county’s lower literacy rate is related to its high poverty rate, and since integration, the district has worked to increase opportunities for students of color, Coffee County School District Superintendent Morris Leis said in an email; he added that the district does not use discipline to “push out” children who have academic challenges, and it has reduced racial disparities in discipline after it initiated a new program in 2014. By that time, Jones had graduated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She aspires to learn how to read through an adult education program and to eventually work at a child care center, but she cannot do so without steady transportation. She has not applied for a driver’s license; though she could take the written test orally like her mother did, she hasn’t been able to find someone who has time to help her study the examination booklet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ordinary tasks are often insurmountable for her. She owns a smartphone, but mining the web for information is daunting. After she fell several months behind on her electric payments, she could not read the notice that warned her lights would be cut off. She likely qualifies for low-cost internet, but she cannot navigate the instructions for accessing it. When she takes her son to the doctor’s office, she prints his first and last name on the forms but asks the staff for help with the rest. Unable to decipher her most valuable documents, like her birth certificate, she entrusts them to her aunt, who can read and helps determine what she needs for appointments and applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jones worries most about keeping up with her 4-year-old son as he grows. She can read beginner books to him, but she knows his knowledge will soon surpass her own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Jones, the voting process itself is like a literacy test. If she changes her address, she cannot easily update her registration. If she enters the polling booth alone, she may recognize a few names on the ballot, but any unfamiliar words could confound her, particularly when it comes to the often-confusing constitutional amendments. She prefers voting by mail, which allows her more time to process her choices, but Georgia’s new election law is making that more difficult. The law has banned outside groups from mailing out absentee ballot applications that have the resident’s information already filled in, and it has limited who can submit the applications on voters’ behalf. The law does include exceptions for people helping “illiterate” voters, but experts say its limit on assistance could still discourage those voters from requesting help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Any law that limits assistance is going to have an impact on voters with limited literacy,” said Sean Morales-Doyle, acting director of voting rights at the Brennan Center for Justice. “Whether or not that’s the intention of the lawmakers, that’s always a difficult thing to say. But I do think sometimes it may very well be the intention.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is impossible to say precisely what role literacy plays in voter turnout. There are many other factors that contribute to lower participation, including some closely intertwined with literacy, such as income and education level. But to put the importance of reading ability in perspective, ProPublica analyzed data on turnout from the three most recent national elections and compared it to average estimated literacy levels for over 3,000 counties. (Read more about our analysis, and the data used, in our methodology.) Our analysis found that if low-literacy counties had turnout similar to high-literacy counties, they could have added up to about 7 million votes to the national total for each of those three elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the country, people like Jones are stumbling through inscrutable election processes fraught with poor ballot design and rigid registration rules. Some are choosing not to vote at all. (Read more about how some states are trying to make voting more accessible.) “We know in general that the more barriers we put in front of people, the lower the participation rate,” said Donald Moynihan, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University. “Even if someone with lower literacy has the same desire to vote as someone reading this article, they have to overcome more barriers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, for example, Ohio legislators began requiring voters to fill out more complicated versions of absentee and provisional ballot forms while at the same time limiting the assistance they could get from poll workers. Minor errors in the paperwork could lead to people’s votes not being counted. In a lawsuit, the Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless claimed that the laws disproportionately harmed poor, nonwhite and low-literacy voters who would be more likely to have their ballots rejected for minor errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data submitted as evidence shows that thousands of forms were tossed in the 2014 and 2015 general elections for simple problems such as incomplete addresses and birthdays. Poll workers refused one form because the street name “Cuthbert” was misspelled as “Cuthberth.” Several others were rejected because birth dates were listed as the current date, an indicator that voters may not have understood the instructions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, a federal judge struck down the measures, concluding they disproportionately harmed Black voters. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that state rules requiring perfect completion of absentee ballot forms posed an undue burden to voters. But the panel said the other measures were minimally disruptive and left in place regulations that limited the assistance voters could get from poll workers and the amount of time voters were given to correct errors on absentee and provisional ballots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What the case demonstrates is the indifference of officials from one political party, and of unfortunately many federal judges, to voting rights and to the need to make voting not only secure, but relatively unburdensome,” said Subodh Chandra, an attorney for the plaintiffs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A similar law in Georgia suspended voter registration applications when the information on the form didn’t exactly match a driver’s license or social security record. (If voters didn’t correct the information within 26 months, Georgia could cancel their registrations.) When then-Secretary of State Kemp ran for governor against Stacey Abrams in 2018, his office suspended the applications of an estimated 53,000 voters, most of them Black, due to these discrepancies. Kemp won the election by about 55,000 votes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A federal judge ordered Georgia to ease the restrictive program, calling it a “severe burden” on some voters. Politicians, academics and advocates have accused Kemp of voter suppression not only for suspending registration applications over minor discrepancies, but also for purging tens of thousands of infrequent voters from the rolls — a more aggressive effort than is made in other states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kemp press secretary Katie Bryd disputed the allegations and noted that Kemp had implemented automatic voter registration through the state’s department of motor vehicles in 2016, which added hundreds of thousands of eligible voters to the rolls. “Politically driven, irresponsible accusations of voter suppression alleged at Governor Kemp have been repeatedly found void of basic facts and validity,” Byrd said in an email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, voters flagged for minor discrepancies in their registration paperwork can no longer be removed from the rolls, but they do have to show a photo identification before they vote.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As Coley-Pearson parked at the polling station, her thoughts flew back to a similar day not long ago when she wound up handcuffed in the back of a police cruiser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October 2020 — more than two years after she was cleared of the felony charges — she was standing in a voting booth helping a young woman with low literacy skills read a ballot, as is allowed by law, when the county’s election supervisor, Misty Martin, confronted her. Martin yelled at Coley-Pearson to not touch the machines and told her she was barred from returning to the polls. Coley-Pearson said she wasn’t touching any machines. “We’re done,” she told the young woman after she finished voting. “Let’s go.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin, who also has used the last names Hampton and Hayes, called the police to report that Coley-Pearson was disruptive, and the department issued a trespass warning barring her from the polls indefinitely. Later that morning, when Coley-Pearson returned to drop off another voter, she was arrested in the parking lot and charged with criminal trespassing. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is looking into election interference claims in Coffee County, including an incident in which Martin allowed several computer experts connected with Trump’s efforts to challenge the 2020 results into her offices, where they may have had access to election systems; Martin resigned from her county post under pressure last year. She did not respond to ProPublica’s questions related to either incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The charge hung over Coley-Pearson for nearly two years; this past June, a state judge agreed to drop the case if she signed a consent order agreeing to follow election law. “There was no evidence of any crime here,” Coley-Pearson said. “It feels like you’re fighting a losing battle.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her daughters see how the last several years have worn her down. AiyEsha Coley said she would sometimes wake up at 4 a.m. to feed her newborn and would find her mother on Facebook, reading through disparaging comments. Her daughters have long campaigned for her to retire from city commission, scared that the stress might eventually kill her. She’s starting to come around, and she plans to leave her post next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now peering into her back seat, Coley-Pearson worried her presence could interfere with Jones and Fillmore’s ability to vote. “I did not want any type of confrontation, I did not want any kind of accusations, I just didn’t want any hassle,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She told them she would not be going in with them and instructed two close friends to help them instead. “When you get through, you all come down there to the tent,” she said, motioning to where her volunteers were sitting out of reach of the rain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coley-Pearson watched the women shuffle into the building and fretted as she waited, leaning on her mobile walker at the edge of the parking lot with a group of volunteer canvassers. She had reminded her friends of the rules, but she knew that sometimes, following them was not enough. “They might try to look for anything they could use against them,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After nearly an hour, Jones and her mother emerged, beaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coley-Pearson’s nerves settled, at least for the moment.</p>",

        "description": "<p>BERLIN — Love Germany or loathe it, few would dispute it is a country of pessimists, a land where glasses are half empty and every silver lining comes with a dark cloud. There is, of course, a German word for this phenomenon: Schwarzmalerei, painting black.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In normal times, Germans’ morose nature offers a wellspring of mirth for its neighbors and allies. With the tide seemingly turning in the war in Ukraine, nobody’s amused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, Christine Lambrecht, the latest in a long line of German defense ministers with little or no military experience, made clear that Ukraine’s battlefield gains would not alter Berlin’s refusal to provide the country with much-needed battle tanks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lambrecht, delivering what was billed as a “landmark” address in Berlin,  castigated Russia for its “horrible war of invasion” and said it was time for Germany to assume a “leadership role” in European security. Helping Ukraine to win would not appear to be part of that strategy.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Germany’s refusal to deliver battle tanks is a classic example of policy driven by Schwarzmalerei. Rooted in fear, the German reluctance doesn’t just threaten Ukrainian security; it undermines the stability and cohesion of the European Union and NATO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Berlin’s hesitation, its inaction, seriously calls into question the value and the alliance with Germany,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told Der Spiegel in an interview published in the weekly’s current edition. The Polish leader, whose country has been among the most generous suppliers of arms to Ukraine, added that “numerous other government leaders in Europe” shared his view.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Russian forces in retreat in eastern Ukraine, if ever there were a time for Berlin to rethink its stance on tanks, it’s now. Instead, the tortuous debate continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent days, Germany’s painters of black have been out in force. For all the progress Ukraine has made on the battlefield, it would be folly, they argue tirelessly, to assume Kyiv can retake its occupied territories, much less win the war.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s probably not going to continue like this,” Christian Mölling, an analyst with the German Council on Foreign Relations, a state-sponsored think tank, told ZDF, the German public broadcaster, over the weekend. The Ukrainians are running low on ammunition and fuel, he noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Johannes Varwick, a German political scientist who has been pouring cold water on Ukraine’s prospects across the country’s media for months, went even darker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Unpopular opinion,” he wrote on Twitter. “In my view, the reports of Ukrainian military success don’t change the big picture: Russia (unfortunately) has escalation dominance and in the medium term higher stamina. There is no alternative to a political reconciliation of interests.”</p>\n\n\n\nGerman refusal to deliver tanks is a classic example of national pessimism | Steffen Kugler/Bundesregierung via Getty Images\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany Andrij Melnyk offered his own frank assessment in response: “Unpopular opinion: Fuck off.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though not all of the country’s war commentators are convinced Ukraine will lose, the pessimism expressed by the likes of Varwick is at the core of Germany’s reluctance — despite widespread public sympathy for the Ukrainian cause — to provide more help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a clear majority of Germans want to support Ukraine, only about one-third advocate sending heavy weaponry such as tanks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Germany has, in fact, delivered heavy weapons to Ukraine, including 10 howitzers, anti-aircraft systems and other, mainly defensive, armaments. Critics say that the degree of military aid, which totaled €1.2 billion as of mid-August, according to data tracked by the Kiel-based Institute for the World Economy, is not commensurate with a country of its size and wealth. By comparison, the U.S. has so far committed some €25 billion in military assistance to Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Germany’s three-way government coalition is divided on the tanks question, with some voices in the Greens and liberal Free Democrats calling for tank deliveries. But practically, the answer remains ‘Nein.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During a visit to Kyiv this weekend, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock was pressed by her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on his country’s need for battle tanks. She declined to make any commitments regarding the tanks, saying only that her government remained in “intensive” deliberations regarding the weapons deliveries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, responsibility for the decision not to send tanks lies with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who likes to point out that neither the United States nor any other country has sent Western-made battle tanks to Ukraine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scholz’s argument is frustrating for those fighting in Ukraine. As the manufacturer of one of the world’s most effective battle tanks, known as the Leopard, no country in Europe is better placed to supply Ukraine than Germany. What’s more, the country has hundreds of decommissioned Leopards at its disposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Berlin’s caution was easier for some to understand in the early days of the war, when the full scale of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s colonial ambitions weren’t yet clear to everyone, it has become increasingly difficult to justify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration, which has generally treated Berlin with kid gloves, has begun taking a more forceful tone. “As much as I admire and applaud all that Germany’s doing … we must do more,” Amy Gutmann, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, told German television on Sunday, adding that the West’s “own peace and prosperity” was at stake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much has been written about the causes of Berlin’s soft approach toward Moscow: The country’s business interests, the legacy of Ostpolitik and the German left’s Russophilia have all played a role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with Ukraine finally making significant progress on the battlefield, it’s difficult not to think Germany’s own history doesn’t have something to do with continued intransigence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Call it the ghost of Stalingrad. It isn’t German war guilt over the damage Hitler’s armies inflicted on Russia that’s at play here (after all, Ukraine suffered more than Russia under German occupation). Rather it’s that like the Ukrainians, the Germans were convinced they could defeat Russia. Ultimately, however, they discovered they could not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the Germans want to reflect on the lessons of history, they would do better to ask themselves a different question. Rather than worry about the miscalculations that led to their loss during World War II, they should reflect on what Europe would look like now if they had been allowed to win.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by William Thomas Cain/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Zac Gallen saves a disappointing series against the Rockies.</p> Diamondbacks News\nGallen Breaks Webb’s Scoreless Streak in Diamondbacks 12-6 Victory - Sports Illustrated\n<p>The only negative on the day was another rough outing for Ian Kennedy, who failed to record an out in the 8th inning, allowing 3 runs on a hit by pitch, a home run by Ryan McMahon, and a base hit that later scored on a fielders choice.</p>\nZac Gallen’s scoreless streak ends, sets Diamondbacks record (azcentral.com)\n<p>“I knew it would end at some point,” Gallen said. “It’s one of those ones where it’s bittersweet. Coming into it, I think the franchise record was the one I was most concerned about, really. Orel and 59 was in a whole other stratosphere for me. I tried not to concern myself with that one. That was looking way too far ahead.”</p>\n<p>As for Webb, Gallen was impressed with how gracious and encouraging he was in recent weeks.</p>\n<p>“I probably wouldn’t have taken it as well as he did, you know, encouraging somebody to break my record,” Gallen said. “It’s just awesome to be able to be mentioned in the same conversation as a legend of the franchise.”</p>\nZac Gallen’s scoreless-inning streak ends at 44 1/3 inning (mlb.com)\n<p>“I’m glad it’s over in the sense that it’s a relief,” Gallen said. “I’m not going to have to worry about trying to be so perfect out there. But at the same time, it’s one of those things that you may never get a shot at again. Ultimately, it was a good run.”</p>\nZac Gallen’s Scoreless Streak: By the Numbers\n<p>Nice breakdown by Michael McDermott.</p>\nAround The MLB\n<p>A couple of news items on former D-Backs...</p>\n\nGiants, Wilmer Flores Agree To Two-Year Extension - MLB Trade Rumors\n\nStarling Marte injury update: Mets outfielder placed on IL with partial non-displaced fracture in finger - CBSSports.com\n\n\nWhite Sox manager Tony La Russa remains out indefinitely with unspecified medical issue - CBSSports.com\n\nRight-hander Edwin Jackson announces retirement after pitching for MLB-record 14 different teams - CBSSports.com\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers first team to clinch a playoff spot (espn.com)\n<p>Well, at least we won’t have to witness that celebration at Chase.</p>\nMLB weekend recap: Pujols hits No. 697; Zac Gallen’s streak ends; Mets-Braves NL East race stays tight - CBSSports.com\n<p>It looks like it will just be a matter of time before Pujols hits a legendary number 700. I like those things except if it happens against OUR team, but we won’t have to be afraid of that.</p>\nAcross The Pacific\nSecond longest tenured foreign player in CPBL retires from baseball (Taiwan)\n<p>37 year old (just a few days away from celebrating his 38th) Mike Loree was a 50-round pick in the 2007 amateur draft of the San Francisco Giants. His career in the States was pretty much over after the Pirates booted him out of AA in 2011 at 26 years of age. In 2012 though he found employment in Taiwan, the last 6 seasons with the Fubon Guardians. He saw his jersey getting retired after 10 years of success.</p>\nLee Young-ha, Kim Dae-hyun indicted for ‘special violence’ after school bullying accusations (Korea)\n<p>Lee and Kim, who are the same age and attended high school together, were accused last year of being bullies while in high school. The pair were among a number of public figures to be retroactively held to account for their behavior at school in recent years, including K-pop stars, actors and fellow athletes.</p>\n<p>Special violence is a charge that falls under Article 261 of Korea’s criminal code, covering a crime committed “through the threat of collective force or by carrying a dangerous weapon.” If found guilty, the pair could face up to five years in prison or a fine of up to 10 million won ($7,400).</p>\nAcross The Atlantic\nMike Piazza to manage Italy in the WBC (Italy)\n<p>The Hall of Famer will lead a team that seems to have gotten commitment from Oriole Trey Mancini, Blue Jays’ starting pitcher Jared Romano and Los Angeles Angels utility infielder David Fletcher, who has a mother that was born in Italy.</p>\nFederation Focus: Czechia\n<p>The Czechs are gaining territory in European baseball, but they battle some big sports in their country: “Czechia is doing good, but could be better. Soccer is the main sport here. Amongst team sports, basketball and ice hockey are also popular. Ice hockey is special to Czech people because of our international success. The number of baseball players is growing steadily, but there’s a lot of competition between the different sports to recruit the best athletes.”</p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>More than 30 Russian municipal deputies have signed a petition calling for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s resignation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The petition, posted by Xenia Torstrem, a deputy in St. Petersburg’s Semyonovsky District, was originally signed by 19 officials. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We, the municipal deputies of Russia, believe that the actions of President Vladimir Putin harm the future of Russia and its citizens,” a translation of the petition reads. “We demand the resignation of Vladimir Putin from the post of President of the Russian Federation!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The petition comes as the Ukrainian military pursues a counteroffensive, quickly reclaiming territory and pushing Russian troops back to the northeastern border in some places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The push’s initial gains have provoked some criticisms of Putin inside the country, a rare rebuke of Russia’s longtime leader who over the years has sought to stifle opposition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The petition was signed primarily by municipal deputies serving in Moscow and St. Petersburg, although the signatories also include officials from cities like Samara and Yakutsk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes after Russia over the weekend held the country’s first election since the start of the war. Voters cast ballots to elect more than 31,000 officials nationwide, although the Kremlin’s opposition has alleged fraud and vote-rigging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The petition potentially places the municipal deputies at risk, given the Kremlin’s law criminalizing the publishing of “fake news” about the war, which Putin refers to as a “special military operation.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Offenders face up to 15 years in jail, and Russian officials have punished dissidents since the troops invaded Ukraine in February.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as Russia faces new losses from the Ukrainian counteroffensive, some Russian military bloggers and patriotic commentators have criticized the Kremlin for failing to take stronger action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“People who convinced President Putin that the operation will be fast and effective … these people really set up all of us,” former Russian parliament member Boris Nadezhdin said on the state-owned NTV station. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The counteroffensive has also lifted Ukrainian morale, but it remains unclear if the operation will mark a turning point in the conflict.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The path to victory is a difficult one,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his daily address on Sunday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“But we are sure: you are capable of it,” he continued. “You will reach our border, all its sections. You will see our frontiers and the enemies’ backs. You will see the shining of the eyes of our people and of the occupiers’ heels. They will call it ‘goodwill gestures.’ We'll call it a victory.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>As the Senate prepared to move on a bill that would protect same-sex marriage, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) on Monday pushed back against GOP objections that it is unnecessary. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Republicans have said the Respect for Marriage Act, which would make marriage a constitutional right regardless of a couple’s sex, race, ethnicity or national origin, is moot because the U.S. Supreme Court has already protected marriage equality. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The same court that overturned Roe vs. Wade puts in jeopardy a number of other Supreme Court cases: the case that affirmed same-sex marriage, the case that affirmed interracial marriage,” Baldwin, the lead Democratic negotiator for the new bill, said on CNN. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawmakers sprung to action after Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, in his opinion on the court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, argued that the justices should also reconsider cases like Obergefell v. Hodges, which secured same-sex marriage as a constitutional right, and Griswold v. Connecticut, which gave married couples the right to access contraceptives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Millions of U.S. couples, Baldwin said, \"are legitimately concerned about the legitimacy of their marriage.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democrats are still working to secure 10 GOP votes to ensure the bill can overcome a Republican filibuster. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a sponsor of the bill, is a \"yes\" vote, along with Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio). Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) previously told reporters that he “probably will” vote for the bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Negotiators are considering an amendment to address GOP concerns about creating legal problems for religious groups, which could expand Republican support for the bill. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Respect for Marriage Act would formally repeal the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which narrowly defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman — legislation that remains in place despite being negated in part by the Supreme Court. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repealing the outdated legislation would be a strong and “very affirming statement” from Congress, Baldwin said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We often think, when we say the word marriage, of the wedding rights, but with a marriage certificate comes very important rights and responsibilities that people rely on, say, hospital visits and, you know, all sorts of things that are really important. So this is timely right now.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wisconsin Democrat also pushed back at Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who reportedly dismissed the bill as \"just Democrats opening up a wound that doesn’t need to be opened up\" and backtracked on earlier indications he'd support the proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is a real issue to millions of couples across the United States. This is not being done for political purposes. We have, already, a nice bipartisan group working very hard to pass it,” Baldwin said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The House passed its Respect for Marriage Act 267-157 in July, with 47 Republicans joining all Democrats voting in favor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill could pass the Senate this month, and Baldwin says she expects the Senate to vote on it next week.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3635755-think-china-is-aggressive-now-wait-until-after-the-20th-party-congress/",
        "description": "<p>Major events are rare in the humdrum of international politics. But when they do occur, much like geology they can shift the ground under your feet, dramatically and suddenly, changing the global landscape. This year will bring the equivalent of a tectonic shift in China’s politics when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) holds its 20th Party Congress, beginning Oct. 16. This will be the most significant Party Congress in many decades, for three reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, despite serious contention with CCP leadership, and major economic and social problems in China, Chinese President Xi Jinping remains its ultimate authority and in control of the Party. His travel to the Central Asian states of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan this month is notable because he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Samarkand at the annual meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, thus signaling their alliance remains strong. Xi’s support for Putin has been unwavering since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trip will be the first time Xi has left China since before the COVID-19 pandemic and it may be the harbinger of more frequent international travel. He is scheduled to visit Bali in November for the G20 Summit, and possibly Thailand as well. The travel plans indicate that Xi is optimistic about his position of power and his ability to advance China’s influence abroad, and act as a signal to other Party leaders and the Chinese people that their leader is active on the global stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, if Xi wins a third term as Party leader and chairman of the Central Military Commission, as expected, it will break precedent for the modern Party leaders after Deng Xiaoping. This is a bold and meaningful step, revealing that Xi sees himself as superior to Deng, and not just Mao Zedong’s equal but perhaps even greater than the “Great Helmsman.” Like Mao, he plans to impose “Xi Jinping Thought” on the Party and the Chinese people, as the CCP Politburo’s statement announced, and to implement measures such as the Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy. This bodes ill for the possibility of any relief for Chinese people who suffer under Xi’s tyrannical rule.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Xi’s third and potentially fourth terms, the CCP wants to move toward achieving its second 100-year goal of building a modern socialist power by 2049, the 100th year of the party-state’s founding. Before that, it must modernize its army by 2027, the 100th year of the People’s Liberation Army’s founding. Meanwhile, the CCP faces a critical point in time when the end of its term is near. Xi will push to fortify his governance in the name of perfecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the Chinese communist system by restructuring the giant power pyramid under the so-called the “fifth modernization,” which enables him to control the Party and state in a more refined, sophisticated, comprehensive and diversified way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is every indication that Xi intends to remain the CCP’s ruler until he dies, is overthrown, or becomes unable to rule for some reason. At 69, he could remain China’s leader for the better part of the next two decades. That means many future U.S. presidents will encounter his rule. Thus, understanding his motivations and strategic aims — to see the People’s Republic of China as the world’s hegemon — and the seriousness with which Xi is determined to achieve his goals is of paramount importance for the Biden administration and its successors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, Xi will become more aggressive and belligerent after the conclusion of the Party Congress — ideologically, diplomatically and militarily. While he will remain watchful of real or imagined opposition, and move to crush it, after the Party Congress he will have his CCP house in order, so to speak. The Party — and indeed, the world — will witness a new beginning in Xi’s leadership. He will be unfettered to achieve his aims. While Xi already has boldly advanced China’s interests against the U.S. and its allies, what has occurred since he came to power in 2012 until now may be a period of moderation compared with what follows this fall’s Party Congress. Xi will be more determined than ever to advance his agenda, including forcing the U.S. from its position of leadership and reshaping global politics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Xi has made it clear that he will use the 20th Congress to mobilize the entire Party and the Chinese people to vigorously promote the building of “a community of common destiny for mankind,” his euphemism for China’s global domination. Xi’s foreign policy will increase its hostility against the United States; he has made it no secret he perceives the U.S. as the biggest obstacle to the CCP’s strategic goal of expanding its core interests. He will increase the size and preparedness of China’s military in anticipation of winning China’s global domination. At the same time, Beijing will continue to deceive the United States for a longer period of strategic opportunity; the CCP is still not strong enough for a showdown with the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Beijing’s “wolf warrior” diplomacy turns more aggressive, the West must anticipate that Xi will seek to conquer Taiwan. Equally important, Washington must expect that the intensity of Xi’s post-Congress belligerence will be greater than it has witnessed, and his ambition will be directed against the U.S. and its allies. The Biden administration likely is unprepared for this.  But an intellectual shift must be made now, and be followed immediately by tangible measures to deter Communist China’s aggression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lianchao Han is vice president of Citizen Power Initiatives for China. After the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989, he was one of the founders of the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars. He worked in the U.S. Senate for 12 years, as legislative counsel and policy director for three senators. Bradley A. Thayer is director of China policy at the Center for Security Policy.  They are the co-authors of “Understanding the China Threat.”</p>",

Who’s coming with me to shut it down?” As of Monday, the tweet had over 1,500 likes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also shared by Don Huffines, a conseravative Texas politician who challenged current Texas Gov.

        "title": "The near-perfect Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 is on sale for the first time ever",
        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/lenovo-chromebook-duet-3-tablet-on-sale",
        "description": "<p>Since the day it launched, I have been checking daily for a deal on Lenovo’s latest Snapdragon-powered tablet. The Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 is nearly the perfect device for those wanting the snappiness of the second generation Snapdragon 7c processor but aren’t keen on using the much larger 13.3″ Duet 5. While the latter lends itself much more to being a better overall device, the smaller Duet 3 wins out when we’re talking about real-world tablet use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my opinion, the 10.9″ Duet 3 has but two notable deficiencies. The first of which really isn’t a deficiency so much as bad timing. The Duet three debuted toting the new USI 2.0 protocol in its display and up until last week, you couldn’t purchase a USI pen that was compatible with the Duet 3. Lenovo is still the only company with a USI 2.0 pen on the market at the moment but more are on the way and this shouldn’t hold you back from considering this dynamic little 2-in-1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My second gripe with the Duet 3 is the fact that it only sports 4GB of RAM. Now, I understand that a device like this isn’t designed to be a productivity monster but still. The larger Duet 5 has the same processor with 8GB of RAM and honestly, you could use it as a daily driver if you wanted to do so. It really feels like manufacturers look at a smaller tablet like this and just assume that it isn’t worthy of decent internals. Doubling the RAM on this little Chromebook would make it darn near perfect in every way. Anyway, that’s my beef but that doesn’t mean that I don’t like the Lenovo Duet 3. In fact, I absolutely love it. It is a great successor to Lenovo’s original Duet and as a tablet, there’s very little to dislike about this Chromebook. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Back to the matter at hand. I have no problem whatsoever recommending the Duet 3 at its retail price of $379 but it has been a tough sell considering the fact that the larger Duet 5 has dropped as low as $350 in the past few weeks. Thankfully, my diligence in tracking the prices of Chromebooks has paid off and today, you can finally score the Duet 3 at a discount. It’s not a deep discount but the $50 in savings brings the price tag down to a very savory $329. That’s only $30 more than the original Duet and it’s a very solid price for a versatile, lightweight ChromeOS tablet that’s simply a joy to use. If you’ve been considering the Duet 3, now is a great time to go ahead and get off the fence. Check it out over at Best Buy before this deal is gone. </p>\n\n\n\n\nLenovo Chromebook Duet 3",

        "link": "https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/09/12/emerson-character-solitude-nature/",
        "description": "“It is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.”\n\n<p>“I felt down in my soul the clear and unmistakable conviction to disobey all, and pursue my own way,” the young Whitman wrote of his momentous critique-walk with his greatest literary hero, Ralph Waldo Emerson (May 25, 1803–April 27, 1882) — the walk from which the young poet wrested his wisdom on how to keep criticism from sinking your soul, for Emerson, who had inspired Leaves of Grass, had just lashed upon one of its primary poem sequences “argumentstatement, reconnoitring, review, attack, and pressing home, (like an army corps in order, artillery, cavalry, infantry,) of all that could be said against [it].”</p>\n<p>But rather than offended, Emerson must have been pleased with Whitman’s decision to stay his course — for Whitman was in many ways the embodiment of the spirit Emerson so fiercely celebrated against the tide of his time: a spirit animated by the central doctrine “trust thyself,” anchored in resolute resistance to the tyranny of opinion, and rooted in the belief that had gotten Emerson banned from Harvard’s campus for thirty years when he was Whitman’s age — the belief that divinity is to be found not in some outside deity, but in the human soul itself, in its fidelity to itself as a fractal of nature, a particle of the perfect totality of the universe, which Margaret Fuller — Emerson’s greatest influence — called “the All.”</p>\nArt by Tanya P. Johnson from her series Wisdom Engines\n<p>Throughout Emerson’s immense body of work, no question vibrates more resonantly than that of how to trust yourself. He takes it up in his essay “Character,” found in his indispensable Essays and Lectures (public library | free ebook):</p>\n<p>What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man* is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.</p>\n<p>In “Nature” — perhaps his finest essay, for being the most all-encompassing and spiritually lucid — he considers what solitude actually means, refuting the common conception of it as a kind of self-isolation from other selves behind the walls of seclusion, for even the thinking mind, the writing mind, the creating mind is a symposium of outside voices when trapped within itself. </p>\nArt by David Byrne from his History of the World (in Dingbats)\n<p>A century and a half before Wendell Berry observed that “true solitude is found in the wild places, where… one’s inner voices become audible,” Emerson writes:</p>\n<p>To go into solitude, a man* needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society. I am not solitary whilst I read and write, though nobody is with me. But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life, — no disgrace, no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground, — my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space, — all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God.</p>\nSpring Moon at Ninomiya Beach, 1931 — one of Hasui Kawase’s stunning vintage Japanese woodblocks. (Available as a print.)\n<p>Complement with Emerson’s young protégé Thoreau on solitude and the salve for melancholy, artist Rockwell Kent on wilderness, solitude, and creativity, and Kahlil Gibran on silence, solitude, and the courage to know yourself, then revisit Hermann Hesse on the wisdom of the inner voice and Octavia Butler on the meaning of “God.”</p>\ndonating = loving<p>For a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the unbearable name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

        "description": "Freddie Freeman indicates the Dodgers playoff seeding this year. | Photo by Denis Poroy/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The Dodgers took care of business by winning two more series against divisional foes, putting them within a whisker of a ninth National League West title in the last 10 seasons.</p>\n<p>Los Angeles has won nine straight series against NL West teams, and their 41-15 mark against the division (.732) would be their best divisional winning percentage in team history. The mark to shoot for is  the 1974 team, who were 63-27 (.700) against the NL West.</p>\n<p>We thought the Dodgers on Sunday clinched a playoff berth, their 10th straight season doing so. But it turns out, thanks to tiebreaker scenarios, that’s not the case.</p>\nBatter of the week \n<p>Freddie Freeman found his home run stroke again, snapping an 87-plate-appearance drought with a three-home run week and ended up hitting .545. It was a close battle with Max Muncy, who also homered three times, drove in nine, and had a 1.559 OPS. Justin Turner was under consideration too with his three homers, including two in Sunday’s clincher.</p>\nPitcher of the week\n<p>Julio Urías continued his consistent run atop the Dodgers rotation. In his one start this week, he pitched seven innings to shut down the Padres outside of two solo home runs, the only source of offense against the left-hander over his last five starts.</p>\nWeek 23 results\n<p>4-2 record40 runs scored (6.67 per game)24 runs allowed (4.00 per game).718 pythagorean win percentage</p>\nYear to date\n<p>96-43 record756 runs scored (5.44 per game)446 runs allowed (3.21 per game).724 pythagorean win percentage (101-38)</p>\n<p>Magic number: 2 to clinch the NL West</p>\nMiscellany\n<p>Century city: When Max Muncy’s three-run home run in the eighth inning put Wednesday’s game to bed, the second player to score on the hit was Freddie Freeman, giving him 100 runs scored on the season. It’s the fourth time in his career scoring at least 100 runs for Freeman, who led the National League in scoring in each of the last two seasons. This year, he’s second in the NL in runs, with 103 through Sunday, behind only teammate Mookie Betts at 109. This is just the third time since moving to Los Angeles that the Dodgers have had multiple players score 100 runs. In 2019, Cody Bellinger and Max Muncy did it, and in 1962 the team had Maury Wills, Tommy Davis, and Willie Davis do so. Trea Turner, who scored a career-high 107 runs last season, has scored 90 times this year, on pace for 105 runs. The franchise record for 100-run Dodgers is six, with Duke Snider, Jim Gilliam, Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese, Roy Campanella, and Gil Hodges all reaching triple digits for the juggernaut 1953 Brooklyn team. </p>\nTransactions\n<p>Monday: Jake Reed, who was designated for assignment on September 2, was claimed off waivers by the Orioles.</p>\n<p>Monday: Eddy Alvarez was released.</p>\n<p>Monday: Justin Bruihl was called up from Triple-A, and Ryan Pepiot was optioned.</p>\n<p>Saturday: Blake Treinen landed on the injured list with shoulder tightness, retroactive to Wednesday.

        "description": "Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>If you’re looking for change, I’d wait until October.</p> <p>As usual before I start doing these types of articles, I like to put negativity in a positivity sandwich. So I’m not going to start this off guns a-blazing and instead I’m going to keep it positive to start this off. Kenley Jansen has largely been doing his job when it comes to being the closer in the Braes bullpen this season. More often than not, he’s been getting  the job done and aside from a few wobbles, he’s been giving the Braves what they needed. It’s quite easy to simply look at the saves leaderboard and see Jansen right up there at the top of not just the National League, but baseball as a whole. Jansen still has plenty to offer in the bullpen!</p>\n<p>With that being said, he’s currently in the midst of another wobble and this has been an extended one. Ever since Jansen walked his way into a blown save back on August 27 in St. Louis, Jansen has been putting up a 9.00 ERA and a 6.72 FIP. That’s not including his latest shocker on Sunday evening, which is when he basically took a gift from Atlanta’s lineup and squandered it by giving up two homers in the bottom of the ninth to turn what would’ve been an incredible comeback into an extremely frustrating loss. That’ll surely put his ERA into double-digits over his past seven appearances, which is not ideally what you want from your closer!</p>\n<p>So what’s going on right now? Usually this would be where I look at the numbers and try  to give you a statistical breakdown as to what’s going on with Kenley Jansen, but it’s not that simple this time around. His velocity hasn’t taken a significant deviation from what you’d expect from him here in 2022 and the rest of his profile doesn’t look terrible at all. However, something is clearly wrong and I think it would be best to just let the man speak for himself:</p>\n\n\n<p>\"My delivery is out of whack right now.\"Kenley Jansen discusses his latest outing ⤵️ pic.twitter.com/FiHCKUrigd</p>— Bally Sports: Braves (@BravesOnBally) September 4, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Kenley Jansen meets with the media following Atlanta's series finale against the Mariners   pic.twitter.com/rA7nhNwhec</p>— Bally Sports: Braves (@BravesOnBally) September 12, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>First off, I definitely appreciate the positive attitude that Jansen is taking towards this wobble. Despite that absolute disaster that he had on Sunday, it’s clear that he’s chomping at the bit to get out there for another chance. That’s good! That’s what you want to see and hear! With that being said, he said it himself; His delivery is off and he’s been missing his location with alarming regularity in his past few starts. Obviously this is something that he’s going to have no choice but to work through and you could ask any Dodgers fan that you know that it’s the type of thing that’s going to happen every now and then with Jansen as the closer. </p>\n<p>So with that in mind, it would probably be best to give Kenley Jansen some low-leverage opportunities for a short period of time while guys like Raisel Iglesias or A.J. Minter get the ball when it comes to closing. If he’s got to work through getting his delivery back in check, then you’d definitely rather see him do that while he’s got plenty of breathing room to play with. Jansen is saying all the right things right now but the results are telling a different story. Something is clearly wrong right now and I’d rather see him work it out without the game being on the line while he’s doing so. </p>\n<p>The only question now is whether or not Brian Snitker is going to deviate from his usual bullpen routine in order to compensate for the fact that Kenley Jansen is going through a particularly rough patch at the moment. I think we all know the answer to that, but here’s some video in case you were wondering:</p>\n\n\n<p>\"He's leading the league in saves.\"Brian Snitker on Kenley Jansen ⤵️ pic.twitter.com/swLmqH9Swi</p>— Bally Sports: Braves (@BravesOnBally) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, it’s looking like we’re going to be seeing Kenley come in for the ninth inning as long as he’s healthy enough to do so. Brian Snitker is a perfectly fine manager and you are not going to see me on here getting snarky with a guy who has been in this sport longer than I’ve been alive and pulled off a bullpen management masterclass on his way to a World Series title last Postseason. </p>\n<p>With that being said, it’s pretty clear by now that Brian Snitker as The Postseason Bullpen Manager is a much different beast when compared to Brian Snitker as The Regular Season Bullpen Manager. If Kenley Jansen is telling him that he just needs to work through it and he’s healthy enough to do so, then Snitker is going to keep on giving Jansen every opportunity to get things under control. We’re probably going to receive a whole bunch of gray hairs as fans watching Jansen work through this wobble in the middle of a pennant chase but it’s looking like we’re going to have to just deal with Jansen going through it at this point. </p>\n<p>So while I have little-to-no faith that Kenley Jansen is going to see a reduced role for the final stage of the regular season, I can at least see two situations that would still have the Braves in good shape going forward. The first situation is that Jansen eventually figures it out on the mound and the Braves go into the postseason with all cylinders firing off. This would involve Jansen going on a run to mirror what Will Smith did last season and who wouldn’t want a repeat of that performance, right?</p>\n<p>The second scenario would mean that Kenley Jansen keeps on struggling as the Braves head into the Postseason. Brian Snitker would be forced to play the hot hand like he’s usually done in the Postseason and that would be when we see Jansen placed in a lower-leverage position in the bullpen. Either way, I don’t see any changes being made until October. Atlanta’s got a proven closer in Jansen and it’s pretty clear that they’re going to stick with him until the end — for better or for worse.</p>",

        "description": "<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>This article first appeared at ProPublica, co-published with Gray TV. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For nearly 10 hours on Georgia’s primary day, Olivia Coley-Pearson tracked down every potential voter she could find, working two cellphones as she paced the parking lot outside the polls, repeating the same message: “You need to tell all your cousins, your brothers, your sisters, your aunts, your uncles — everybody you know — to come on down here to vote.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A third of her neighbors in Coffee County struggle to read at a basic level, and she wanted to make sure they had help navigating their ballots. In the late afternoon, she slid behind the sparkly pink steering wheel of her SUV for her final push of the day, heading down a long stretch of road where buildings gave way to fields and thickets of pine. She turned in to the Kinwood Estates mobile home park and stopped at the edge of a familiar dirt driveway just as Shondriana Jones, 30, bounded down the steps of a trailer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I can’t find my ID and Mama, she’s still at work,” Jones said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coley-Pearson has helped the family vote for years — she’s known them since she and Jones’ mother, Sabrina Fillmore, were young. Now 60, Coley-Pearson serves as a city commissioner in Douglas, the majority-Black county seat. Fillmore, 54, works at the local poultry plant cutting chickens. Neither Fillmore nor her daughter can read beyond a first-grade level, but they rarely miss an election, believing their votes can influence everything from their electricity costs to the way police treat them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coley-Pearson urged Jones to track down a utility bill to prove her identity at the election office just as Fillmore returned from a 10-hour shift, exhausted. With the women aboard, Coley-Pearson started the car, anxiety brewing in her mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though federal law guaranteed the two women the right to have someone help them vote, Coley-Pearson knew too well that this right was under attack. For all of the recent uproar over voting rights, little attention has been paid to one of the most sustained and brazen suppression campaigns in America: the effort to block help at the voting booth for people who struggle to read — a group that amounts to about 48 million Americans, or more than a fifth of the adult population. ProPublica analyzed the voter turnout in 3,000 counties and found that those with lower estimated literacy rates, on average, had lower turnout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“How the system is set up, it disenfranchises people,” said Coley-Pearson, who blames Southern political leaders for throwing up hurdles. “It’s by design, I believe, because they want to maintain that power and that control.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conservative politicians have long used harsh tactics against voters who can’t read — poor, often Black and Latino Americans who have been failed by the U.S. education system and who conservatives feared would vote for liberal candidates. Some states have required voters who needed help to sign an affidavit explaining why they need assistance; some have prevented voters who couldn’t read from bringing sample ballots to the polls and limited the number of voters that a volunteer could help read a ballot. Time and again, federal courts have struck down such restrictions as illegal and unconstitutional. Inevitably, states just create more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last two years, the myth of election fraud, supercharged by former President Donald Trump in the wake of his 2020 loss, has fueled a barrage of new restrictions. While they do not all target voters who struggle to read, they make it especially challenging for voters with low literacy skills to get help casting ballots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, Georgia passed a law limiting who can return or even touch a completed absentee ballot. Florida expanded the radius around election locations in which volunteers are prohibited from asking people if they need help. Texas passed a law prohibiting voters’ assistants from answering questions or paraphrasing complicated language on the ballot; a federal judge struck down several sections of the law in June. But the court left other provisions in place, including ones that increase penalties for helping voters who don’t qualify and require people who assist voters to fill out more paperwork. Texas did not appeal the decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To appreciate the impact of voter suppression, consider that recent elections have been determined by a narrow sliver of the electorate:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite losing the popular vote, Trump secured the presidency in 2016 by winning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan by a margin of just under 80,000 total votes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Joe Biden prevailed in 2020 by winning Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin by just over 40,000 votes combined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coley-Pearson recognizes the importance of this moment for Georgia, which is no stranger to close elections. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp faces another challenge from Democrat Stacey Abrams, and Sen. Raphael Warnock is attempting to hold on to his seat in a race that could tip the Senate back to Republican control. But to Coley-Pearson, helping people vote isn’t only about politics or even just about their rights as individuals. It is about the future of democracy at a time when it seems like the views of the majority are being marginalized by the actions of the few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a child in the 1970s, she’d watched as her mother, Gladys Coley — who stood just above 5 feet and had only an eighth grade education — rose to the helm of the local NAACP and challenged the discriminatory school system and police department. Her mother begged her not to return from college in Atlanta, but Coley-Pearson wanted to fight for the people of Coffee County, too. As she headed to the polls on primary day this past May, though, she couldn’t subdue her fear that by helping Jones and Fillmore, she was putting a target on her own back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of several years, she’d become tangled in an investigation of supposed voter fraud, which took aim at her attempts to assist voters who requested help. She had pleaded her case to television cameras and at a hearing before the state’s highest election official. She had even wound up in jail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Intimidation is real,” Coley-Pearson said. “If we don’t continue to vote, they’re going to have us right back where it used to be.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Coley-Pearson was born in an era when Southern states forced convoluted literacy tests on voters to keep Black people out of the polls. In those days, local voting officials often made exceptions for white people who couldn’t read. In 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act prohibiting racial discrimination at the polls. That didn’t stop white conservatives, especially in the South, from continuing to discriminate against voters with low literacy skills, who, due to centuries of oppression, were disproportionately Black.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conservatives argued that removing barriers for voters who couldn’t read would allow the federal government to overrule states’ decisions on how to run local elections and would hand more votes to liberal candidates. Clearly, they said, voters with low reading skills would be easily swayed by anyone assisting them, leading to rampant fraud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Today the bureaucrats are issuing certificates to vote to people who cannot read the ballot nor even the instructions on a ballot or on a voting machine,” segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace declared in late 1965. “The left wing liberals need as many illiterates as they can get to vote in order to keep them in power.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 1981, voters of color, including those with low literacy levels, still faced “white resistance and hostility,” according to a U.S. Commission on Civil Rights report. “For many minority voters, the kind of assistance that they receive at the polls determines whether they will vote,” the report stated. “If minority voters who do not speak English or who are illiterate receive inadequate assistance, they may become too frustrated and discouraged to vote or they may mark their ballots in such a way that they will not be counted.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Congress amended the Voting Rights Act in 1982 to affirm that voters who need help due to an “inability to read” could bring someone, other than their employer or union representative, to assist them in the voting booth. A string of subsequent lawsuits shows this federal action again failed to eradicate the discrimination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a 2001 case, the federal justice department claimed that white poll managers in Charleston County, South Carolina, were intimidating Black voters who requested assistance. According to testimony given in the case, the poll workers launched a barrage of questions at these voters, such as, “Can’t you read and write? And didn’t you just sign in? And you know how to spell your name, why can’t you just vote by yourself? And do you really need voter assistance?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A federal judge found that there was “significant evidence of intimidation and harassment,” but said evidence of the mistreatment was too “anecdotal” to take direct action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2012, the chairman of Coffee County’s board of elections filed a complaint against Coley-Pearson and three other residents, alleging that they’d assisted voters who didn’t legally qualify for help. Georgia law only allows voters to receive assistance if they are disabled or cannot read English. The secretary of state’s office, then under Kemp’s leadership, initiated an investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following summer, a 52-year-old line cook named Alvin Williams answered his phone to find a state investigator on the other end. The man had questions about the 2012 election. “It looks like you were assisted by Olivia Pearson,” said state investigator Glenn Archie, in a recording obtained by ProPublica. (Archie did not respond to a request for comment.) “It’s not marked why she assisted you and I was wondering why you needed assistance.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tone of the man’s voice made Williams nervous. “Because I can’t read. I’m illiterate,” Williams told Archie. He’d dropped out of school at 16 to work full time catching chickens and selling them to the local poultry plant, a job he’d skipped classes for since he was 11 to help support his family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m sure she read the candidates to you,” Archie said. “Did you get to pick the people you wanted to vote for?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Yes, sir,” Williams said. “I can’t read. That’s why she was helping me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“That’s no problem,” the investigator assured him. “She can assist you if you have problems reading.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the call left Williams humiliated and fearful of how his vote could be used against him or Coley-Pearson. “I don’t fool with the law,” he said in a recent interview. “And I don’t do nothing for them to fool with me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some other voters told investigators that they had requested and received help even though they could read. The investigation found that Coley-Pearson and the other volunteers neglected to verify whether some voters qualified for help and incorrectly filled out forms indicating why voters needed assistance. It also found that election workers failed to include required information on many forms and turned them in without making sure they were accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testifying at a 2016 hearing chaired by Kemp, Coley-Pearson maintained that she hadn’t broken any laws. In response to a poll worker’s claim that she’d touched the voting machine, Coley-Pearson said she’d merely accompanied voters who had requested her assistance and stood by to answer questions about the process or read names on the ballot. She said she followed the instructions of the poll workers, signing forms when directed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If someone asks me for help, I felt an obligation to try to assist if I could,” she testified at the hearing, stressing that she never told anyone who to vote for. Coley-Pearson suspected there was a deeper significance to the investigation and told the board, “Sometimes things are done to try to maybe dis-encourage, or whatever, other people from voting, and I don’t feel like that is fair.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state election board chose not to recommend her case for criminal prosecution, but a local district attorney’s office prosecuted her anyway, which made national headlines in BuzzFeed. It charged her with two felonies for improperly assisting a voter and for signing a form that gave a false reason for why a voter needed assistance. The trial ended with a hung jury. One of two Black people on the jury told a local reporter that she was the only holdout; everyone else voted to find Coley-Pearson guilty. She was tried again in a nearby county and, after about 20 minutes of deliberations, the new jury acquitted her of all charges. The district attorney’s office did not respond to ProPublica’s emailed questions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Three other volunteers took plea deals in which they admitted to making false statements on forms indicating the reason that a voter needed assistance; in exchange, they got probation, after which any fines would be waived. One of them, James Curtis Hicks, said that if he had fought his case and lost, he could have faced jail time or a mountain of fines. He didn’t want to take any risks. “Around here, to me, they target the leaders, the people that are standing up for the rights of the minority,” he said in a recent interview. “To shut me and Ms. Pearson down, it would stop a whole lot of people going to the polls.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, the 59-year-old truck driver had kept tabs on Coffee County voters to see if they needed help reading the ballot. But after the settlement, he stopped. “I didn’t want a focus on me to suppress anyone else,” he said. “I really felt intimidated.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the charges didn’t deter Coley-Pearson.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Before Jones could vote that May afternoon, she needed to get temporary identification. Dodging the pouring rain, she and Coley-Pearson scuttled into the elections office shortly before it closed. At nearly 6 feet tall, Coley-Pearson towered over the woman sitting behind a plexiglass barrier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She needs a voter ID, sweetie,” Coley-Pearson said, leaning in. The woman handed Jones an application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You need me to do it, baby?” Coley-Pearson asked softly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jones nodded, “Yes, ma’am.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The woman at the counter emphasized that Jones had to complete it on her own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She has trouble reading and writing,” Coley-Pearson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a tense moment, the woman agreed that Coley-Pearson could fill out the form. She read the questions out loud and filled in Jones’ answers, pointing out which lines to sign and date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jones is in the third generation of her family that is not able to read. Her grandmother never learned how, and her mother, Fillmore, left high school in her sophomore year, after frequently being disciplined for fighting. As an adult, Fillmore briefly attended an education program to help her learn how to read, but she felt discouraged and left.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jones graduated from high school in Coffee County but says she reads at the same first-grade level as her mother. She remembers attending special education classes with more field trips than written assignments and says teachers never diagnosed her with a learning disability or gave her one-on-one assistance. School administrators also frequently suspended her for fighting, she said. “They were trying to get rid of me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coffee County has long failed to provide an equal education for students of color. In 1969, federal officials sued its school board for refusing to integrate white and Black schools. Even after the school system was integrated, Black students continued to receive fewer academic resources and harsher punishments than their white peers. A decade ago, the district acknowledged its shortcomings in reading instruction and the need to rectify its problems with literacy, which were more pronounced for Black students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The county’s lower literacy rate is related to its high poverty rate, and since integration, the district has worked to increase opportunities for students of color, Coffee County School District Superintendent Morris Leis said in an email; he added that the district does not use discipline to “push out” children who have academic challenges, and it has reduced racial disparities in discipline after it initiated a new program in 2014. By that time, Jones had graduated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She aspires to learn how to read through an adult education program and to eventually work at a child care center, but she cannot do so without steady transportation. She has not applied for a driver’s license; though she could take the written test orally like her mother did, she hasn’t been able to find someone who has time to help her study the examination booklet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ordinary tasks are often insurmountable for her. She owns a smartphone, but mining the web for information is daunting. After she fell several months behind on her electric payments, she could not read the notice that warned her lights would be cut off. She likely qualifies for low-cost internet, but she cannot navigate the instructions for accessing it. When she takes her son to the doctor’s office, she prints his first and last name on the forms but asks the staff for help with the rest. Unable to decipher her most valuable documents, like her birth certificate, she entrusts them to her aunt, who can read and helps determine what she needs for appointments and applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jones worries most about keeping up with her 4-year-old son as he grows. She can read beginner books to him, but she knows his knowledge will soon surpass her own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Jones, the voting process itself is like a literacy test. If she changes her address, she cannot easily update her registration. If she enters the polling booth alone, she may recognize a few names on the ballot, but any unfamiliar words could confound her, particularly when it comes to the often-confusing constitutional amendments. She prefers voting by mail, which allows her more time to process her choices, but Georgia’s new election law is making that more difficult. The law has banned outside groups from mailing out absentee ballot applications that have the resident’s information already filled in, and it has limited who can submit the applications on voters’ behalf. The law does include exceptions for people helping “illiterate” voters, but experts say its limit on assistance could still discourage those voters from requesting help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Any law that limits assistance is going to have an impact on voters with limited literacy,” said Sean Morales-Doyle, acting director of voting rights at the Brennan Center for Justice. “Whether or not that’s the intention of the lawmakers, that’s always a difficult thing to say. But I do think sometimes it may very well be the intention.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is impossible to say precisely what role literacy plays in voter turnout. There are many other factors that contribute to lower participation, including some closely intertwined with literacy, such as income and education level. But to put the importance of reading ability in perspective, ProPublica analyzed data on turnout from the three most recent national elections and compared it to average estimated literacy levels for over 3,000 counties. (Read more about our analysis, and the data used, in our methodology.) Our analysis found that if low-literacy counties had turnout similar to high-literacy counties, they could have added up to about 7 million votes to the national total for each of those three elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the country, people like Jones are stumbling through inscrutable election processes fraught with poor ballot design and rigid registration rules. Some are choosing not to vote at all. (Read more about how some states are trying to make voting more accessible.) “We know in general that the more barriers we put in front of people, the lower the participation rate,” said Donald Moynihan, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University. “Even if someone with lower literacy has the same desire to vote as someone reading this article, they have to overcome more barriers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, for example, Ohio legislators began requiring voters to fill out more complicated versions of absentee and provisional ballot forms while at the same time limiting the assistance they could get from poll workers. Minor errors in the paperwork could lead to people’s votes not being counted. In a lawsuit, the Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless claimed that the laws disproportionately harmed poor, nonwhite and low-literacy voters who would be more likely to have their ballots rejected for minor errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data submitted as evidence shows that thousands of forms were tossed in the 2014 and 2015 general elections for simple problems such as incomplete addresses and birthdays. Poll workers refused one form because the street name “Cuthbert” was misspelled as “Cuthberth.” Several others were rejected because birth dates were listed as the current date, an indicator that voters may not have understood the instructions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, a federal judge struck down the measures, concluding they disproportionately harmed Black voters. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that state rules requiring perfect completion of absentee ballot forms posed an undue burden to voters. But the panel said the other measures were minimally disruptive and left in place regulations that limited the assistance voters could get from poll workers and the amount of time voters were given to correct errors on absentee and provisional ballots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What the case demonstrates is the indifference of officials from one political party, and of unfortunately many federal judges, to voting rights and to the need to make voting not only secure, but relatively unburdensome,” said Subodh Chandra, an attorney for the plaintiffs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A similar law in Georgia suspended voter registration applications when the information on the form didn’t exactly match a driver’s license or social security record. (If voters didn’t correct the information within 26 months, Georgia could cancel their registrations.) When then-Secretary of State Kemp ran for governor against Stacey Abrams in 2018, his office suspended the applications of an estimated 53,000 voters, most of them Black, due to these discrepancies. Kemp won the election by about 55,000 votes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A federal judge ordered Georgia to ease the restrictive program, calling it a “severe burden” on some voters. Politicians, academics and advocates have accused Kemp of voter suppression not only for suspending registration applications over minor discrepancies, but also for purging tens of thousands of infrequent voters from the rolls — a more aggressive effort than is made in other states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kemp press secretary Katie Bryd disputed the allegations and noted that Kemp had implemented automatic voter registration through the state’s department of motor vehicles in 2016, which added hundreds of thousands of eligible voters to the rolls. “Politically driven, irresponsible accusations of voter suppression alleged at Governor Kemp have been repeatedly found void of basic facts and validity,” Byrd said in an email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, voters flagged for minor discrepancies in their registration paperwork can no longer be removed from the rolls, but they do have to show a photo identification before they vote.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As Coley-Pearson parked at the polling station, her thoughts flew back to a similar day not long ago when she wound up handcuffed in the back of a police cruiser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October 2020 — more than two years after she was cleared of the felony charges — she was standing in a voting booth helping a young woman with low literacy skills read a ballot, as is allowed by law, when the county’s election supervisor, Misty Martin, confronted her. Martin yelled at Coley-Pearson to not touch the machines and told her she was barred from returning to the polls. Coley-Pearson said she wasn’t touching any machines. “We’re done,” she told the young woman after she finished voting. “Let’s go.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin, who also has used the last names Hampton and Hayes, called the police to report that Coley-Pearson was disruptive, and the department issued a trespass warning barring her from the polls indefinitely. Later that morning, when Coley-Pearson returned to drop off another voter, she was arrested in the parking lot and charged with criminal trespassing. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is looking into election interference claims in Coffee County, including an incident in which Martin allowed several computer experts connected with Trump’s efforts to challenge the 2020 results into her offices, where they may have had access to election systems; Martin resigned from her county post under pressure last year. She did not respond to ProPublica’s questions related to either incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The charge hung over Coley-Pearson for nearly two years; this past June, a state judge agreed to drop the case if she signed a consent order agreeing to follow election law. “There was no evidence of any crime here,” Coley-Pearson said. “It feels like you’re fighting a losing battle.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her daughters see how the last several years have worn her down. AiyEsha Coley said she would sometimes wake up at 4 a.m. to feed her newborn and would find her mother on Facebook, reading through disparaging comments. Her daughters have long campaigned for her to retire from city commission, scared that the stress might eventually kill her. She’s starting to come around, and she plans to leave her post next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now peering into her back seat, Coley-Pearson worried her presence could interfere with Jones and Fillmore’s ability to vote. “I did not want any type of confrontation, I did not want any kind of accusations, I just didn’t want any hassle,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She told them she would not be going in with them and instructed two close friends to help them instead. “When you get through, you all come down there to the tent,” she said, motioning to where her volunteers were sitting out of reach of the rain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coley-Pearson watched the women shuffle into the building and fretted as she waited, leaning on her mobile walker at the edge of the parking lot with a group of volunteer canvassers. She had reminded her friends of the rules, but she knew that sometimes, following them was not enough. “They might try to look for anything they could use against them,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After nearly an hour, Jones and her mother emerged, beaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coley-Pearson’s nerves settled, at least for the moment.</p>",

        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/09/search-for-extraterrestrial-life-aliens/671410/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "<p>What exactly do we mean by alone when we ask whether we’re alone in the universe?  </p><p>The search for extraterrestrial life is one of astronomy’s grandest projects. But the search is more multifaceted than anyone casually intrigued by aliens might realize. At its core lies the question of what version of life we are seeking. On Earth, and presumably beyond, life exists on a spectrum of forms and capacities. But for the purposes of tracking it down in the cosmos, it can be lumped into two somewhat crude categories: “dumb life” and “smart life.” Dumb life consists of things such as microbes and plants that can proliferate across a planet but are unlike humans as self-conscious, technological thinkers. Smart life consists of creatures like us that build planet-spanning technologies.    </p><p>With deep apologies to microbes, plants, and even elephants for the ham-fisted nomenclature, this distinction between dumb and smart life matters because each can be detected in a different way. Given the mind-wilting distances between stars, even our most advanced tools for surveying far-off worlds won’t be delivering on-the-ground pictures of alien pine trees or anteaters anytime soon. Instead, we must look for indirect signatures of life when surveying a planet. First, there are biosignatures, such as the presence of oxygen and methane in the atmosphere. These are gases that might only be found together because a biosphere—the collective activity of all life on a planet—keeps them there. Second, there are technosignatures. The presence of complex industrial chemicals in the atmosphere or the reflected glint of massive solar-panel deployment would tell astronomers that a technologically capable species like us inhabits that distant world.</p><p>To maximize our chances of discovering life, the ideal would always be to scour a planet for both signatures. But astronomers have a big universe to explore and only so much time and money to do the exploring. With projects requiring decades to bear fruit, scientists must choose their shots carefully. (The James Webb Space Telescope, humanity’s newest and most powerful observatory, cost roughly $10 billion, which tells you something about the resources at play.) So far, in the search for extraterrestrial life, dumb life has won out. With healthy funding from NASA, astronomers have made astonishing progress over the past 20 years articulating what kinds of biosignatures might exist on alien worlds. This progress has been remarkably rewarding, but it could come with a cost. Could we be missing out on the promise of smart life?</p><p>[Read: Looking for solar panels on distant planets]</p><p>It’s worth remembering that the first scientific search for extraterrestrial life was a search for extraterrestrial intelligence, i.e., SETI. In 1960, the astrophysicist Frank Drake launched Project Ozma, an experiment using radio telescopes to search for signals from chatty high-tech civilizations. Back then, no one could even imagine a way to search for trees or insects or microbes on distant planets orbiting distant stars; no one even knew if such planets existed. Although for decades SETI remained the only game in town in the search for life, it always suffered from a giggle factor. More than once, congressional representatives used “the search for little green men” to whip NASA for wasting tax dollars. As a result, radio SETI’s funding suffered. The field has lived on life support for most of the past 40 years (though recent funding via the private Breakthrough Listen effort has helped).</p><p>Meanwhile, in 1995, the search-for-life game changed forever. The first planet orbiting another sunlike star was discovered, and astronomers realized that they could directly detect biosignatures by observing starlight passing through an exoplanet’s atmosphere. The development of this technique, called “atmospheric characterization,” has been one of the major successes of NASA’s astrobiology program. Astronomers recently ranked a space-based “life-finder” telescope as one of their top funding priorities in a once-in-a-decade survey of the field. Amid the clamor of biosignatures, technosignatures have often seemed like an afterthought, if they have come up at all.</p><p>The allure of biosignatures is clear. Many astronomers start out assuming that biosignatures will be more prevalent than technosignatures. After all, you can’t have a civilization-building species evolve on a planet before life does. And from Earth’s history—our only reference point on life’s path—it’s clear that basic forms of life have been around far longer than technology. Earth was sporting biosignatures for all the universe to see more than 3 billion years ago. Only over the past century or so have we begun dressing ourselves in technosignatures. That means technosignatures have been on Earth for less than 0.00001 percent as long as biosignatures have. From this perspective, technosignatures might seem like mere icing on the cake of detectable life.  </p><p>There is, however, another dimension to the question that a simple evolutionary progression fails to recognize. A new study, led by Jason Wright of Penn State University and to which I contributed as part of a NASA-funded technosignature-research group, has laid out the argument that astronomy is overlooking the value of technosignatures. The problem with biosignatures is that they’re forever tied to their biospheres—their planets. Biosignatures have no way to leave their biosphere of origin. And, for that matter, if all life were to disappear from Earth tomorrow, most of Earth’s biosignatures would disappear quickly too. For example, the oxygen in our atmosphere comes from the planet’s life. If that life went extinct, atmospheric oxygen would react back into rocks and disappear quickly on the scale of deep time.</p><p>To detect a biosignature, in other words, we have to find a fully functional biosphere. But we don’t really know how long biospheres generally last. Ours has, thankfully, persisted for more than 3 billion years. But there are many ways a biosphere might die, including the loss of the planet’s atmosphere from solar winds or a really big asteroid impact. Once the biosphere goes, the biosignatures likely go with it.</p><p>Technosignatures have no such constraint. Consider the fact that the solar system is already full of Earth’s technosignatures. More than 10 spacecraft are orbiting Mars or on its surface right now. And that’s just one planet. Hundreds of other spacecraft are out there traversing the sun’s spaceways. We have even blasted five craft entirely out of the solar system and into the interstellar domain. Every one of these machines we’ve sent into space constitutes a material technosignature—an artifact—in its own right. More important, all of the active ones are sending radio signals into space. These signals are weak, but each still constitutes a technosignature that some other species conceivably could detect.  </p><p>[Read: Seriously, what’s making all these mysterious signals in space?]</p><p>Unlike biosignatures, technosignatures move and endure. The Apollo 11 moon lander will be sitting on the moon for millions of years because there’s no wind or water to erode it away.  Projecting forward, if we were to cover a fraction of the moon with solar panels and then succumb to some civilization-crashing accident, those panels might still be visible to alien observers long after we disappeared. Meanwhile, in our own search for life, imagine an interplanetary civilization that has freighters routinely moving between worlds. Engine-exhaust plumes, tight-beam laser communications, even waste disposal, if the alien civilization burned its garbage, might show up as a signal—a signature—that we could detect on Earth. All of these technosignatures could be transmitted far from the alien civilization’s home world (let’s call it a “technosphere”). An alien civilization might even use uninhabitable worlds in its solar system to host its industry or energy generation. Such “service worlds,” as my colleagues and I call them, would only generate technosignatures, because no biosphere would be present.</p><p>Technosignatures could also be prolific. A single civilization and its technosphere could produce millions or even billions of individual objects that each could create detectable technosignatures. Imagine a civilization that is thousands or millions of years older than our own. Not only might it routinely create legions of artifacts that emit technosignatures; it might also create more technospheres. Unlike biospheres, technospheres can reproduce themselves via intentional space settlement. By these measures, imagining what distant civilizations might invent through advanced technologies, humanity so far might hardly even count as smart life.</p><p>There is plenty to argue about here. On a specific level, for instance, a critic might respond that biospheres can also reproduce via panspermia, the process when a chunk of microbe-bearing rock gets blown into space by an asteroid impact and then lands on another fertile world. Calculations show that panspermia may be relatively rare occurrences even in the best of circumstances, however. Meanwhile, a single space-faring civilization could seed the entire galaxy with new technospheres as it settled ever more distant worlds. That said, this all is speculation. We have yet to discover extraterrestrial life, so we have no idea what true ratio of smart to dumb life exists out in the cosmos. Advanced civilizations may well be so exceptionally rare that the odds are still in dumb life’s favor. I wouldn’t bet on this; but then again, so much remains undiscovered.</p><p>One misconstrued takeaway from our group’s research could be that the priority in life hunting should now shift to technosignatures. That is not, however, what we concluded. Instead, in reviewing the past biases and future possibilities, we came to see biosignatures and technosignatures as a continuum. So far, scientists have designed their life-detection tools to target either smart or dumb life, but in the wake of discovering exoplanets, the same kinds of telescopes and the same kinds of detectors attached to those telescopes can now be deployed for finding both kinds of life. These searches could even happen at the same time as astronomers look for signatures of biospheres and technology in the same parts of the electromagnetic spectrum while observing the same planet.  </p><p>The decades-old biases against technospheres, including the giggle factor tying them to little green men and UFO conspiracies, are no longer tenable. Astronomers will still have to make hard decisions based on limited resources, but those decisions should be made just on the strength of the specific search proposal rather than parsing the search for life into an artificial biosignature-versus-technosignature split. We are in truly a remarkable moment. After thousands of years of arguing over the question of life in the universe, we are finally capable of searching for answers. Finding any kind of life—dumb or smart—would constitute a fundamental reframing of our place in the cosmos. Let’s look for all of it.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Ed Zurga/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The Royals will have to pick up the pace.</p> <p>Baseball has approved new rules in 2023 designed to improve the pace of play and lift sagging batting averages around the game. The new rules include:</p>\n\nA ban on defensive shifts\nA 15-second pitch clock with no runners on base, and a 20-second pitch clock with runners on;\nA limit of two pickoff attempts per hitter, with the third attempt constituting a balk if the runner is not picked off\nLarger bases, from 15 inches square to 18 inches square, to lessen the chances a runner steps on a defender’s foot.\n\n<p>How could these new rules affect the Royals?</p>\nBan on defensive shifts\n<p>Shifts have always been a part of the game, even back when infielders crowded the right side of the infield for Ted Williams. But they have become ubiquitous with a defensive shift employed 34 percent of the time this year - 55 percent of the time against left-handed hitters. Accordingly, BABIP on groundballs has fallen about six points since 2015. </p>\n<p>The new rules will require four defenders within the infield dirt (sorry Frank White) and two on each side of second base when the pitch is thrown. Overall the ban on defensive shifts has had a negligible effect on BABIP, but it could have a huge impact on certain hitters. Vinnie Pasquntino is one of the most shifted-on hitters in the big leagues, facing a shift 94 percent of the time, although he has had little trouble with it, posting a .354 weighted OBA. </p>\n<p>Salvador Perez could be the hitter that most benefits from a ban on shifts. You can see where he peppers the ball in the infield (just ask Josh Donaldson!)</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>Salvy and MJ Melendez are the two most successful Royals hitters against the shift, and each could see a big offensive boost if teams are limited in how many defenders they have on the pull side.</p>\n\n<p>Defensively, the Royals may not see much difference without a shift. Only five teams in baseball shift less than they do, although Royals pitches have fared a bit better when the defense employs the shift as they do with a standard defensive alignment.</p>\nPitch clock\n<p>If you watch a game from 30 years ago and compare it to a game today, what will stand out to you is the amount of dead time between pitches in modern baseball. Grant Brisbee observed this in an article where he compared a 1984 Cubs game to a game from 2014, finding the total time of “inaction pitches” - when nothing happens - was 32 minutes 47 seconds in 1984 compared to 57 minutes 41 seconds in 2014. </p>\n<p>The pitch clock is an attempt to reduce this dead time, and after tinkering with different times in the minors, settled on 15 seconds with no runners on base and 20 seconds with a runner on. Pitchers are going to have to speed things up - Fangraphs keeps track of the seconds between pitches and has found pitchers overall average 23.1 seconds-per-pitch. </p>\n<p>If there is one pitcher that will definitely not be affected by the pitch clock, its Brady Singer. He has the quickest pace of any pitcher in baseball with at least 100 innings pitched this year, taking an average of just 19.5 seconds-per-pitch. The man pitches like his hair was on fire, and anyone that saw his outing on Sunday knows he means business. He went seven innings in a game that took just two hours and 11 minutes to play.</p>\n<p>The Royals pitcher who will have to pick up the pace is Josh Staumont, who takes an average of 28.2 seconds-per-pitch. </p>\n\n<p>Almost every pitcher should be at least somewhat familiar with a pitch clock by now - it has been in effect in the upper minors since 2015, and in spring training games since 2019. The clock has not shown any changes in fastball velocities in pitchers, and little change in walk rates, home run rates, or hit-by-pitch rates. Some actually feel the pitcher may be at an advantage with a faster tempo.</p>\n\n<p>Bowie right-hander Shelton Perkins further explained the advantage pitchers might have.</p>\n<p>“When we get the sign, we know what we’re throwing. A hitter sees a pitch, two pitches, he’s trying to process his scouting report, what he thinks might be coming. It kind of speeds up his process,” Perkins said. ”So really, it favors us.”</p>\n\nMore stolen bases\n<p>The change that might appeal to the Royals the most are the combination of limiting pickoff attempts and larger bases. This has caused stolen base attempts to rise in the minor leagues, which could allow the Royals to run more. Attempts are up 27 percent in the minors since 2019 and success rate have gone up from 68.2 percent to 77.6 percent. </p>\n<p>The Royals have the second-fastest man in baseball with Bobby Witt Jr., according to Sprint Speed data. He has stolen 27 bases in 34 attempts this year, but we could see that number rise, particularly if batting averages do go up with a ban on shifts. Nate Eaton also ranks highly in sprint speed, and if Adalbert Mondesi returns next year and stays healthy, he could benefit from the new rules as well.</p>\n<p>Mike Matheny already seems to be licking his chops at the prospect of having more incentive to send his young hitters.</p>\n<p>“The bigger base for a speedy team, especially we’re in this park that’s us, I like that,” Matheny said. “We like to steal bases and be more incentivized to lay a bunt down, be more incentivized to put a ball and try to leg it out. You’re gonna see infield hits go up.”</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p> </p>",

Also discussed are the coming rule changes and the August Players of the Month.</p> <p>The Purple Row podcast Affected by Altitude is hosted by staff writers Evan Lang, Skyler Timmins, and Mac Wilcox, who are all incredibly proud and excited to be lending their voices to more great Purple Row content for you to enjoy.</p>\n<p>This week, Evan, Mac, and Skyler discuss how the Colorado Rockies are finally letting the kids play. Elehuris Montero, Sean Bouchard, Michael Toglia, Brian Serven, and Alan Trejo are all rookies getting regular playing time in the waning days of the 2022 season. It certainly makes meaningless September baseball a lot more watchable. They also discuss the injury to lefty reliever Lucas Gilbreath and what losing him means for the Rockies bullpen. Meanwhile, Major League Baseball has officially pushed forward with rule changes starting in 2022. The hosts discuss what they are and how they feel about the changes coming to the sport. It’s also time to name the August Players of the Month!</p>\n\n<p>★ ★ ★</p>\n<p>Affected by Altitude is a weekly or bimonthly podcast featuring roundtable discussion, game segments, interviews, and the occasional hot take from a group of Purple Row contributors. We live in different places, have varying backgrounds, and may or may not think Michael Toglia is actually three children standing on each others’ shoulders in a trenchcoat. Regardless, we are all united in our love of the Rockies and a desire to provide Purple Row readers with a fresh new voice.</p>\n<p>Are you a Purple Row reader and a Rockies fan? Then this show is for you. Please let us know how we’re doing, what you would like to see moving forward, or how we can do better.

Of the first he became a canny investigator and observer, of the second a talented practitioner. Fifteen novels and several collections of short stories testify to these two lifelong interests, and his success can be measured in the enthusiasm of the reading public who eagerly sought out his books, published in close to 50 languages.</p><p>Of course, the world of spies was not his only interest: he enjoyed dissecting the games of academia, the tangles of erotic strategies, the gossipy realm of writing and publishing. But the spy story above all allowed Marías to explore the consequences of our playing games with each other. Whatever story he chose to tell was for him merely a starting point: the reader had to do the rest. “Once you’ve finished a novel,” says one of his characters in The Infatuations, “what happened in it is of little importance and soon forgotten. What matters are the possibilities and ideas that the novel’s imaginary plot communicates to us and infuses us with, a plot that we recall far more vividly than real events and to which we pay far more attention.”</p> Continue reading...",

But as Charles Arthur warns, \"conceiving what will happen when things scale up is really, really difficult.

        "description": "<p>The Marlins have made a few roster moves prior to today’s doubleheader against the Rangers, per their transactions tracker at MLB.com (hat tip to Jordan McPherson of the Miami Herald). Right-hander Aneurys Zabala has been selected to the roster while fellow righty Bryan Hoeing has been recalled as the club’s “29th man” for the twin bill. Left-hander Andrew Nardi was optioned in a corresponding move. The club already had a vacancy on their 40-man roster for Zabala.</p>\n<p>Zabala, 25, was first selected to the club’s roster back in June, though he was designated for assignment just two days later. He cleared waivers and was outrighted back to Triple-A. He got a second selection in August but was designated again after just a few days, again clearing waivers and being outrighted. Since that was his second outright, he had the ability to reject the assignment and become a free agent but chose to stick with the Fish. He’ll now get a third stint on the roster.</p>\n<p>Zabala has pitched just 2 2/3 scoreless innings in the majors so far, in between those transactions. In the minors, he’s been getting his fare share of strikeouts but struggling with control. In 22 innings this year between Double-A and Triple-A, he’s struck out 26.3% of batters faced but walked an awful 24.6%. For context, the major league average walk rate for a reliever is 9.2% this season. No doubt thanks to those free passes, Zabala’s minor league ERA for the year is 9.82.</p>",

        "description": "<p>I will be presenting the above-titled paper at the 2022 Symposium Contemporary Issues in Election Law run by the University of New Hampshire Law review, October 7th in Concord, NH.  The paper will be published in the UNH Law Review in 2023 and is available now on SSRN.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have already serialized parts of this paper on Freedom-to-Tinker: Securing the Vote; unsurprising and surprising insecurities in Democracy Live’s OmniBallot; the New Jersey lawsuit (and settlement); the New York (et al.) lawsuit;  lawsuits in VA, NJ, NY, NH, and in NC; inherent insecurity; accommodating voters with disabilities; and Switzerland’s system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now here it is in one coherent whole, with footnotes.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abstract.  No known technology can make internet voting secure, according to the clear scientific consensus. In some applications—such as e-pollbooks (voter sign-in), voter registration, and absentee ballot request—it is appropriate to use the internet, as the inherent insecurity can be mitigated by other means. But the insecurity of paperless transmission of a voted ballot through the internet, cannot be mitigated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The law recognizes this in several ways. Courts have enjoined the use of certain paperless or internet-connected voting systems. Federal law requires states to allow voters to use the internet to request absentee ballots, but carefully stops short of internet ballot return (i.e., voting).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But many U.S. states and a few countries go beyond what is safe: they have adopted internet voting, for citizens living abroad and (in some cases) for voters with disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most internet voting systems have an essentially common architecture, and they are insecure at least at the same key point, after the voter has reviewed the ballot but before it is transmitted. I review six internet voting systems deployed 2006-2021 that were insecure in practice, just as predicted by theory—and some were also insecure in surprising new ways, “unforced errors”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can’t get along without the assistance of computers. U.S. ballots are too long to count entirely by hand unless the special circumstances of a recount require it. So computer-counted paper ballots play a critical role in the security and auditability of our elections. But audits cannot be used to secure internet voting systems, which have no paper ballots that form an auditable paper trail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are policy controversies: trustworthiness versus convenience, security versus accessibility. In 2019-22 there were lawsuits in Virginia, New Jersey, New York, New Hampshire, and North Carolina; legislation enacted in Rhode Island and withdrawn in California. There is a common pattern to these disputes, which have mostly resolved in a way that provides remote accessible vote by mail (RAVBM) but stops short of permitting electronic ballot return (internet voting).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would it take to thoroughly review a proposed internet voting system to be assured whether it delivers the security it promises? Switzerland provides a case study. In Switzerland, after a few years of internet voting pilot projects, the Federal Chancellery commissioned several extremely thorough expert studies of their deployed system. These reports teach us not only about their internet voting system itself but about how to study those systems before making policy decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility of election systems to voters with disabilities is a genuine problem. Disability-rights groups have been among those lobbying for internet voting (which is not securable) and other forms of remote accessible vote by mail (which can be adequately securable). I review statistics showing that internet voting is probably not the most effective way to serve voters with disabilities.</p>",

        "description": "Dennis Schneidler-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Gleyber Torres had a big day Sunday, but has struggled for quite a while now, and his swing visibly reflects that.</p> <p>I have personally written about Gleyber Torres quite a bit recently, but I don’t think that is without reason. When someone experiences the changes that Torres has, from the first half to the second, there is plenty to pick apart about his performance. He had a huge game Sunday afternoon, but pretty much everything has fallen off for him in the second half. He’s walking less, striking out more, not hitting for much power, and all in all has a wRC+ 70 points lower than it was in the first half before play began Sunday. In the last few weeks however, something has visually stood out to possibly (partially) explain his obvious struggles at the plate. His swing has looked uncomfortable and jagged, with quite the hitch as the bat crosses the plate and into the follow through. </p>\n<p>It has been documented plenty, but as a refresher, Torres hit to a 130 wRC+ in the first half, on par with hitters like Trea Turner and Kyle Tucker this season. In the second half before Sunday’s game, that number has been 50, good for the fourth worst of any qualified hitter in baseball. As noted, in that drop off, Torres had seen his strikeout rate go from 19 percent to 28.6, and he’d been slugging under .300, when he was near .500 in the first half. It would seem, at least, that this doesn’t just happen inexplicably.</p>\n<p>Lately, the infielder’s swing has been visibly uncomfortable at times. I am no mechanics expert, but there’s at least something off enough to make it noticeable. On the follow-through of his swing, and even as the bat crosses the plate sometimes, there seems to be a disconnect. In August I wrote about his trouble hitting non-fastballs, and how he seemed to be hesitating on them resulting in bad chases and weak contact. The problem I’m talking about now is in a similar vein. It would all seem to be related to timing and intent on swinging at certain pitches. </p>\n<p>Regardless of the exact issue(s), the result is some pretty ugly swings. Here are a few whiffs Torres has had in the last couple of weeks:</p>\n\n<p>The jaggedness on the second half of these swings is visible, and cannot be good grounds for productive contact (or any contact at all). His follow-through, along with the swing itself, seems cut down and disconnected. Notably, all of these follow-throughs are with one hand as well. This is not an inherently bad thing by any means, plenty of great hitters have a one-handed follow-through, it’s largely a matter of preference and circumstance. But, let’s look at a few great swings Torres had in June and July, when he was at his best this season:</p>\n\n<p>These are no doubt impressive swings, showing some legit power the other way much of the time. It is also hard to ignore the fact that Torres has a two-handed follow-through on these swings. This is obviously not the case 100 percent of the time, and it doesn’t have to be, but these swings are Torres at his best. The motion as a whole is much more fluid, without that hitch on the back half.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting too, that the majority of these are balls hit to the opposite field, so perhaps the visible struggles of late could be partially attributed to Torres being in a pull-happy mindset. Which again, is not an inherently bad thing, but the results of whatever it is he may be doing speak for themselves.</p>\n<p>There are likely plenty of things to point to and pick apart in Gleyber Torres’ disparate halves of this season, even aspects like this which are visible to the naked eye. But as the Yankees continue to be bit by the injury bug and roll out a lineup that looks more and more like a AAA one, Torres finding his A-swing and returning to form becomes more and more vital. Hopefully, Sunday’s two-homer game is a sign of better things ahead.</p>\n<p></p>",

Ross is Black. A police incident report said one of the officers involved in the shooting was Black, and one was white.</p><p>The city's new Force Investigation Unit, established last month, was handling the investigation.</p><p>Police said two drug enforcement detectives spotted several people with guns at the service station and drove to the parking lot. Their car was unmarked and they were in plain clothes but wearing black, bulletproof vests with the word “POLICE” written on the front and back.</p><p>Ross, armed with a gun according to the police report, walked away quickly to an alley. The detectives followed him and announced they were police officers. Ross allegedly ran, then tripped and fell, dropping a pistol.</p><p>As the detectives approached, Ross reached for the pistol, the report said, prompting both officers to shoot him. Ross was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. The officers were unhurt.</p><p>It was the second fatal officer-involved shooting in St. Louis in less than a week. Officers killed a 61-year-old man last Wednesday at an apartment complex. Police said a man who had been evicted engaged police in a standoff. When officers entered the building, the man allegedly charged at officers with a butcher knife, prompting several to open fire.</p><p>In August, St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones signed legislation creating a Division of Civilian Oversight, an independent agency to investigate allegations of police misconduct and use of force incidents. Under the new law, a Force Investigation Unit under the direction of the circuit attorney investigates use-of-force incidents.</p><p>The St. Louis region drew national scrutiny for officer-involved shootings of young Black men in the wake of Michael Brown's death in the St. Louis County town of Ferguson in August 2014. Brown, who was 18, was killed in a street confrontation with Officer Darren Wilson. Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing, but the shooting led to months of often-violent protests.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Millions of miles away on Mars, in a barren crater just north of the equator, a rover is wandering around, carrying a gold-coated gadget the size of a toaster. The machine inhales the Martian air and strips away contaminants. It splits the atmospheric gas into constituent parts, takes what it needs, and then reassembles that blend to create something that is in very short supply on Mars: oxygen. Real, breathable oxygen, the kind you took in as you read these sentences.</p><p>After a bit of analysis, the machine puffs out the oxygen, harmlessly releasing the molecules into the Martian environment. The act makes this very sophisticated toaster, situated in the belly of NASA’s Perseverance rover, the closest thing to a small tree on Mars.</p><p>And according to the researchers behind the little machine, it’s a pretty good tree. Every time they’ve run it, the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment—MOXIE, for short—has successfully converted Martian air, which is almost entirely made of carbon dioxide, into oxygen gas. “We’re not far from being able to produce oxygen at the rate that would sustain a human being,” Michael Hecht, a planetary scientist at MIT’s Haystack Observatory who leads the project, told me. “A small dog would be just fine at the rate that we produce.”</p><p>[Read: What would a dog do on Mars?]</p><p>MOXIE is a clever chemistry experiment. It is also a remarkable event in the history of space exploration. If human beings want to build a long-term home on Mars, they’ll have to make use of the planet’s natural resources instead of lugging everything they need all the way from Earth. “We have to be able to live off the land,” Jennifer Heldmann, a NASA scientist who works in this futuristic field—known as in situ resource utilization—told me. “This is the first time that we’ve been able to test and demonstrate the technology to do that.”</p><p>And oxygen is wonderfully versatile. Not only would it sustain humans on a planet that their lungs weren’t designed for, but it could also be combined with other compounds to produce rocket fuel so that they could return to Earth. On Mars, we’re the aliens. We’d need to invent all kinds of stuff to give future astronauts a chance to survive there, let alone live comfortably. It is almost sci-fi-ish to think about, but by tinkering with Mars’s atmosphere, we—as in humankind—have managed to figure out at least one piece of that endeavor.</p><p>The MOXIE experiment whirred into action in February of last year, after Perseverance touched down and started working toward its prime mission: collecting rocky samples that could contain the tiny imprints of long-dead Martian life. MOXIE had its own work cut out for it. The Martian atmosphere is so thin that, compared with our own, it’s almost a vacuum. “I like to say we’re making oxygen out of thin air,” Hecht said. “If you were a Martian, you would think that those of us on Earth are fish swimming around in a thick soup of atmosphere.”</p><p>[Read: We’ve never seen Mars quite like this]</p><p>Mars also experiences far more dramatic shifts in its atmospheric conditions. Daytime and nighttime temperatures can vary by about 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius). The air shifts as well, thinning out during the warm days and becoming denser during the cold nights. Swings in air pressure occur seasonally, too. During Martian winters, some of the atmosphere condenses into frost and settles over the poles, reducing the air pressure across the rest of the planet. During Martian summers, air pressure ticks up. All of these factors influence the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere—MOXIE’s main snack.</p><p>To see how MOXIE would fare, engineers powered up the instrument during different times of day and different seasons. They found that “the most difficult time to collect carbon dioxide is in the middle of the day, in the middle of the winter, when it’s both warm and the pressure is low,” Hecht said. “And the easiest time is the middle of the night in the middle of the summer, when the pressure is high and the temperature is low.” But during every run, the machine worked, spending an hour churning out oxygen.</p><p>The team has yet to deploy MOXIE during dawn or dusk, though, when “the density of the air is changing, and the temperature is changing rapidly,” Hecht said. Engineers are concerned that the sudden shift in the presence of carbon dioxide could damage the instrument as it draws the gas in. Hecht says they’ll do some testing with a lab version of MOXIE on Earth first, but they’re confident that they can get their little lunch box to work under these conditions, too.</p><p>[Read: Mars’s soundscape is strangely beautiful]</p><p>Other groups of scientists are thinking about how to make oxygen factories for future Mars missions; one team recently devised a method for generating oxygen from carbon dioxide with the help of plasma. And other researchers are thinking deeply about how to use additional resources on Mars, such as the ice deposits just below the planet’s surface. Future astronauts could mine the frozen water and purify it for everyday use. They could also steal the water’s hydrogen molecules and put them toward the work of getting home. “You can make methane, which is a rocket propellant,” Julie Kleinhenz, a NASA research engineer who studies in situ resource utilization and is not involved with the MOXIE project, told me. “You could fully refuel an ascent vehicle with methane and oxygen just by using resources on Mars, through processes that are pretty well understood.” Some basic items, such as spacesuits and toilets, will have to come over from here. But if you can make something on Mars, you can reduce the heavy baggage that makes it more difficult to blast off from Earth.</p><p>The team behind MOXIE imagines a future in which a scaled-up version, capable of doing the work of hundreds of trees, hums away on the surface of Mars, working around the clock. The factory would be launched ahead of a human mission, so that there would be plenty of oxygen reserves by the time astronauts arrive. That future is still many years away; NASA says the earliest that it could land astronauts on the red planet is sometime in the early 2040s. Elon Musk wants to go much earlier than that with SpaceX, but even the space billionaire will face the same constraints that would make a Mars trip difficult (funding, physics, the cosmic radiation between here and there). A mega-size MOXIE would be just one item on a very long packing list. But MOXIE has a certain concreteness to it that feels thrilling even now. It is the kind of detail that makes a human base on Mars seem a tiny bit more realistic. Imagine, decades from now, an engineer sitting at a console, inhaling air derived from an alien atmosphere, and telling one of her staff: “Hey, Steve, we’re getting some weird MOXIE readings—can you go check it out?”</p>",

        "description": "<p>Europe’s medicines regulator has given BioNTech/Pfizer’s second Omicron-targeting COVID vaccine the green light, paving the way for shipments to EU countries immediately, the companies said in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vaccine has been designed to protect against the latest Omicron variants (BA.4 and BA.5), which are currently dominant in Europe, as well as the original virus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news comes just 12 days after Europe authorized the use of the first Omicron-targeting shots, from both BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna. These vaccines target the first Omicron strain (BA.1) and the original virus first discovered in China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BioNTech/Pfizer’s second Omicron-targeting shot is the first COVID-19 vaccine to be approved in Europe without the need for large-scale clinical trials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following a model that is adopted for seasonal flu jabs each year, the regulators accept that the technology is safe and effective based on animal and laboratory studies, as well as clinical trials with very similar versions of the vaccine. Subsequent efficacy trials will be carried out to confirm this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some have concerns that the arrival of a second type of Omicron vaccine will confuse those coming forward for vaccination. But the European Medicines Agency said a suite of shots is what’s needed to keep people safe this winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The EU’s strategy is to have a broad range of adapted vaccines that target different SARS-CoV-2 variants so member states have various options to meet their needs when they design their vaccination campaigns,” the regulator said in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is a key element in the overall strategy to combat the pandemic as it is not possible to predict how the virus will evolve in the future and which variants will be circulating this winter.”</p>",

        "description": "Yee who are afraid shall be welcomed by the Dark Side. | Photo by Chris Williams/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>“The Fear Of Loss Is A Path To The Dark Side.”</p> Feel The Force.\n<p>Darker times are upon us if we have to believe many experts. That is especially true for baseball with autumn and October baseball approaching, but for the Diamondbacks it is a reality already as the Dodgers enter town.</p>\n<p>Prepare and take out the light to free all those blue hordes of the darkness.</p>\n  \n        \n      Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n      Image of a Dodger being slowly transformed into a normal person again. This is the second state of transitioning where the Dodger has already taken on some human form and starts wearing good clothing. The third state would be getting a human face and the final and fourth state is getting empathy and a viable IQ.\n  \n<p>A week ago we were surely a bit more optimistic than we are right now. Some on this site were even talking about play-offs. After a lost opportunity in San Diego and a cold shower in Denver, the Diamondbacks and their fans have returned to earth and are probably aware that achieving 3rd place in this division, getting ahead of the Giants and staying away from the Rockies will be a fine achievement.</p>\n<p>We all know the Dodgers, so we don’t have to remember anyone on here that in the upcoming series we will play the toughest team the Diamondbacks will face in 2022. The Dodgers just clinched a play-off spot after completing yet another series win (against the Padres), so at least we won’t see them pissing in the pool because of that.</p>\n<p>I won’t get into a discussion on who is really the best team in the entire MLB (discussions on weak divisions bla bla bla), but statistically the Dodgers are because they have the best W-L%, most runs scored and least runs allowed. </p>\n<p>Their batting line-up is fearful and Mookie Betts, Justin Turner and Freddie Freeman can be found amongst the league leaders in almost any category. The team themselves leads the entire league in OBP and SLG and other related categories, while they are league average in strikeouts and are amongst the least teams that ground into double play. Yep, this is a powerful lineup with no weaknesses except for Arizona native Cody Bellinger.</p>\n<p>Together with the Astros the Dodgers lead the MLB in pitching as well. Los Angeles has the lowest ERA of all teams, second-lowest base on balls, leader in baserunners allowed, and is a top 10 in strikeouts. That is even more impressive if you know that they have had their starting pitchers going off and on the IL. Clayton Kershaw and all of his pains are probably a well-known story, but the Dodgers also lost Walker Buehler to the IL with TJ and recently their All Star pitcher Tony Gonsolin as well, with a right forearm strain. And add to them “he-who-shall-not-be-named” as well of course.</p>\n<p>Besides Buehler and Gonsolin, the Dodgers are also without relievers Brusdar Graterol, Yency Almonte, David Price, Víctor González and (former) D-Backs’ fan favourite Daniel Hudson for this series.</p>\n<p>But that doesn’t stop them from beating any opponent and it probably won’t stop them from beating the Snakes either.</p>\n  \n        \n      Photo by Sarah Sachs/Arizona Diamondbacks/Getty Images\n      Image and reaction of Mike Hazen after reading this article and asked about the D-Backs’ odds on beating the Dodgers.\n  \nThe Matchups.\n<p>We are not entirely without a chance though. In 2020* the D-Backs went 2-8, in 2021 we went 3-16 and for this season we are 2-9. So, yeah, of course we have a possibility of winning at least one game. So let’s try and seek which of the three upcoming match-ups will achieve at least that for us.</p>\nGame #1 Mon 09/12 6:40 MST, Tyler Anderson (LAD) vs Ryne Nelson (ARI)\n\nTyler Anderson. 154.2 IP, 2.73 ERA/3.42 FIP, 1.028 WHIP, 1.7 BB/9, 6.8 K/9.\nRyne Nelson. 7 IP, 0.00 ERA/1.12 FIP, 0.571 WHIP, 0.0 BB/9, 9.0 K/9.\n\n<p>We all know Tyler Anderson well. The former Rocky was a reliable force in Denver for 4 years before pitching to a terrible 11.76 ERA in 2019. He was put on waivers by the end of that season, finally signed a $1.775 million contract in San Francisco and was non-tendered again at the end of the 2020 season. Went to Pittsburgh for $2.5MM and pitched respectably for the Pirates and Mariners in 2021. Then signed a big $8MM contract in Los Angeles. </p>\n<p>Fairy tales only exist in Dodgerland, because that contract ends up being a steal: Anderson is the anchor of this Dodger’s rotation and even earned his first All Star selection.</p>\n<p>Yuck.</p>\n<p>There isn’t much to nag about Tyler Anderson, because he has been doing consistently great this season: he has success against both lefties and righties and has been pitching as well after the All Star break as before. Anderson already faced the Diamondbacks twice this season, getting two wins and allowing just two runs in 13 innings of work. His last win against us, at Chase Field on May 29, was also the last time the two teams met.</p>\n<p>It will be a tough matchup, once again, for Ryne Nelson who after going 7 scoreless against the Padres, will now face a much better hitting line-up in the Dodgers. If he was on some adrenaline the last time, I hope he is able to get on more of that this Monday, because the Diamondbacks will definitely need a great outing from the youngster again to be able to rob a win from Anderson. Is that reasonable? You decide.</p>\n  \n        \n      Rob Schumacher/The Republic / USA TODAY NETWORK\n      Here is an image of Mike Hazen in disguise while he tries to flee from the AZSnakePit reporters to avoid difficult questions.\n  \nGame #2 Tue 09/13 6:40 MST, Clay Tonker-Shaw (LAD) vs Merrill Kelly (ARI)\n\nClayton Kershaw. 96.1 IP, 2.62 ERA/2.70 FIP, 0.965 WHIP, 1.7 BB/9, 9.5 K/9.\nMerrill Kelly. 171.2 IP, 2.94 ERA/3.28 FIP, 1.083 WHIP, 2.6 BB/9, 7.7 K/9.\n\n<p>Although some might say that his All Star selection maybe wasn’t completely based on his performance, Kershaw, when healthy, has once again been great for the Dodgers this season. Whether he might choke or not in the post-season isn’t much of our concern, because we will only see him on the mound in the regular season, and, well, we aren’t exactly without a possibility. </p>\n<p>Kershaw has pitched well, but most of his success has come against AL Central teams, Cubs and the Reds. Were those match-ups deliberately planned? Who might know, but the Rockies have had his number this year, just like the Giants have been able to take him out early in the game. We can bet on that and that lefties have hit better of Kershaw than righties this year. We just need Kelly to pitch another one of his gems and the bullpen not to blow a lead and we might very well be able to take the second game from the Dodgers. I know that is a lot to ask for, but I suggest we try to lit a candle to make it happen once again.</p>\n  \n        \n      Photo by Norm Hall/Getty Images\n      “I call upon thee, oh great Merrill, to give us long and happy game” - image and transcription of Torey Lovullo’s prayers to higher forces. Brent Strom is seen making gestures to please accept the offer of having started a game with Bumgarner.\n\n  \nGame #3 Wed 09/14 6:40 MST, TBD (LAD) vs TBD (ARI)\n<p>It is 900 AM MST as I write this right now and MLB still has the starting pitchers for the final game on Wednesday as TBD, although Nick Piecoro already has Zach Davies pencilled in as the D-Backs starter, which makes most sense.</p>\n<p>Davies went just 4 innings in his last outing and was punished severely by the Rockies. Ever since returning from his injury early August Davies has not been able to complete a 6th inning, and for the season he has just a 2-4 W-L record, and since August only NDs. That means that on the one hand he hardly dominates but on the other hand is able to keep the team in the game as well. That is probably the best we can hope for against the Dodgers. Our “meh” starting pitcher Davies has faced Dodger evil three times this season, going 4 innings in two starts and 5.1 in his latest match-up with them. </p>\n<p>Davies has had just 4 scoreless appearances, twice against the Rockies and the others against the Cubs and Pirates, so it will be hard to imagine him not giving up any runs against the best offensive team in the league and completing 5 innings would be an accomplishment.</p>\n<p>If the Dodgers don’t plan on giving a spot start to someone else, my guess is that Dustin May will start the game for the Dodgers. May recently returned from Tommy John. The righty was good in his first two starts against the Marlins, but the next two outings against the Padres he encountered tougher luck. The Dodgers have nothing to lose in running him out against the Diamondbacks and see him going 5 innings or 90 pitches.</p>\n<p>Promo: U of A night.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Millions of miles away on Mars, in a barren crater just north of the equator, a rover is wandering around, carrying a gold-coated gadget the size of a toaster. The machine inhales the Martian air and strips away contaminants. It splits the atmospheric gas into constituent parts, takes what it needs, and then reassembles that blend to create something that is in very short supply on Mars: oxygen. Real, breathable oxygen, the kind you took in as you read these sentences.</p><p>After a bit of analysis, the machine puffs out the oxygen, harmlessly releasing the molecules into the Martian environment. The act makes this very sophisticated toaster, situated in the belly of NASA’s Perseverance rover, the closest thing to a small tree on Mars.</p><p>And according to the researchers behind the little machine, it’s a pretty good tree. Every time they’ve run it, the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment—MOXIE, for short—has successfully converted Martian air, which is almost entirely made of carbon dioxide, into oxygen gas. “We’re not far from being able to produce oxygen at the rate that would sustain a human being,” Michael Hecht, a planetary scientist at MIT’s Haystack Observatory who leads the project, told me. “A small dog would be just fine at the rate that we produce.”</p><p>[Read: What would a dog do on Mars?]</p><p>MOXIE is a clever chemistry experiment. It is also a remarkable event in the history of space exploration. If human beings want to build a long-term home on Mars, they’ll have to make use of the planet’s natural resources instead of lugging everything they need all the way from Earth. “We have to be able to live off the land,” Jennifer Heldmann, a NASA scientist who works in this futuristic field—known as in situ resource utilization—told me. “This is the first time that we’ve been able to test and demonstrate the technology to do that.”</p><p>And oxygen is wonderfully versatile. Not only would it sustain humans on a planet that their lungs weren’t designed for, but it could also be combined with other compounds to produce rocket fuel so that they could return to Earth. On Mars, we’re the aliens. We’d need to invent all kinds of stuff to give future astronauts a chance to survive there, let alone live comfortably. It is almost sci-fi-ish to think about, but by tinkering with Mars’s atmosphere, we—as in humankind—have managed to figure out at least one piece of that endeavor.</p><p>The MOXIE experiment whirred into action in February of last year, after Perseverance touched down and started working toward its prime mission: collecting rocky samples that could contain the tiny imprints of long-dead Martian life. MOXIE had its own work cut out for it. The Martian atmosphere is so thin that, compared with our own, it’s almost a vacuum. “I like to say we’re making oxygen out of thin air,” Hecht said. “If you were a Martian, you would think that those of us on Earth are fish swimming around in a thick soup of atmosphere.”</p><p>[Read: We’ve never seen Mars quite like this]</p><p>Mars also experiences far more dramatic shifts in its atmospheric conditions. Daytime and nighttime temperatures can vary by about 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius). The air shifts as well, thinning out during the warm days and becoming denser during the cold nights. Swings in air pressure occur seasonally, too. During Martian winters, some of the atmosphere condenses into frost and settles over the poles, reducing the air pressure across the rest of the planet. During Martian summers, air pressure ticks up. All of these factors influence the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere—MOXIE’s main snack.</p><p>To see how MOXIE would fare, engineers powered up the instrument during different times of day and different seasons. They found that “the most difficult time to collect carbon dioxide is in the middle of the day, in the middle of the winter, when it’s both warm and the pressure is low,” Hecht said. “And the easiest time is the middle of the night in the middle of the summer, when the pressure is high and the temperature is low.” But during every run, the machine worked, spending an hour churning out oxygen.</p><p>The team has yet to deploy MOXIE during dawn or dusk, though, when “the density of the air is changing, and the temperature is changing rapidly,” Hecht said. Engineers are concerned that the sudden shift in the presence of carbon dioxide could damage the instrument as it draws the gas in. Hecht says they’ll do some testing with a lab version of MOXIE on Earth first, but they’re confident that they can get their little lunch box to work under these conditions, too.</p><p>[Read: Mars’s soundscape is strangely beautiful]</p><p>Other groups of scientists are thinking about how to make oxygen factories for future Mars missions; one team recently devised a method for generating oxygen from carbon dioxide with the help of plasma. And other researchers are thinking deeply about how to use additional resources on Mars, such as the ice deposits just below the planet’s surface. Future astronauts could mine the frozen water and purify it for everyday use. They could also steal the water’s hydrogen molecules and put them toward the work of getting home. “You can make methane, which is a rocket propellant,” Julie Kleinhenz, a NASA research engineer who studies in situ resource utilization and is not involved with the MOXIE project, told me. “You could fully refuel an ascent vehicle with methane and oxygen just by using resources on Mars, through processes that are pretty well understood.” Some basic items, such as spacesuits and toilets, will have to come over from here. But if you can make something on Mars, you can reduce the heavy baggage that makes it more difficult to blast off from Earth.</p><p>The team behind MOXIE imagines a future in which a scaled-up version, capable of doing the work of hundreds of trees, hums away on the surface of Mars, working around the clock. The factory would be launched ahead of a human mission, so that there would be plenty of oxygen reserves by the time astronauts arrive. That future is still many years away; NASA says the earliest that it could land astronauts on the red planet is sometime in the early 2040s. Elon Musk wants to go much earlier than that with SpaceX, but even the space billionaire will face the same constraints that would make a Mars trip difficult (funding, physics, the cosmic radiation between here and there). A mega-size MOXIE would be just one item on a very long packing list. But MOXIE has a certain concreteness to it that feels thrilling even now. It is the kind of detail that makes a human base on Mars seem a tiny bit more realistic. Imagine, decades from now, an engineer sitting at a console, inhaling air derived from an alien atmosphere, and telling one of her staff: “Hey, Steve, we’re getting some weird MOXIE readings—can you go check it out?”</p>",

        "title": "Should We Be Searching for Smart Aliens or Dumb Aliens?",
        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/09/search-for-extraterrestrial-life-aliens/671410/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "<p>What exactly do we mean by alone when we ask whether we’re alone in the universe?  </p><p>The search for extraterrestrial life is one of astronomy’s grandest projects. But the search is more multifaceted than anyone casually intrigued by aliens might realize. At its core lies the question of what version of life we are seeking. On Earth, and presumably beyond, life exists on a spectrum of forms and capacities. But for the purposes of tracking it down in the cosmos, it can be lumped into two somewhat crude categories: “dumb life” and “smart life.” Dumb life consists of things such as microbes and plants that can proliferate across a planet but are unlike humans as self-conscious, technological thinkers. Smart life consists of creatures like us that build planet-spanning technologies.    </p><p>With deep apologies to microbes, plants, and even elephants for the ham-fisted nomenclature, this distinction between dumb and smart life matters because each can be detected in a different way. Given the mind-wilting distances between stars, even our most advanced tools for surveying far-off worlds won’t be delivering on-the-ground pictures of alien pine trees or anteaters anytime soon. Instead, we must look for indirect signatures of life when surveying a planet. First, there are biosignatures, such as the presence of oxygen and methane in the atmosphere. These are gases that might only be found together because a biosphere—the collective activity of all life on a planet—keeps them there. Second, there are technosignatures. The presence of complex industrial chemicals in the atmosphere or the reflected glint of massive solar-panel deployment would tell astronomers that a technologically capable species like us inhabits that distant world.</p><p>To maximize our chances of discovering life, the ideal would always be to scour a planet for both signatures. But astronomers have a big universe to explore and only so much time and money to do the exploring. With projects requiring decades to bear fruit, scientists must choose their shots carefully. (The James Webb Space Telescope, humanity’s newest and most powerful observatory, cost roughly $10 billion, which tells you something about the resources at play.) So far, in the search for extraterrestrial life, dumb life has won out. With healthy funding from NASA, astronomers have made astonishing progress over the past 20 years articulating what kinds of biosignatures might exist on alien worlds. This progress has been remarkably rewarding, but it could come with a cost. Could we be missing out on the promise of smart life?</p><p>[Read: Looking for solar panels on distant planets]</p><p>It’s worth remembering that the first scientific search for extraterrestrial life was a search for extraterrestrial intelligence, i.e., SETI. In 1960, the astrophysicist Frank Drake launched Project Ozma, an experiment using radio telescopes to search for signals from chatty high-tech civilizations. Back then, no one could even imagine a way to search for trees or insects or microbes on distant planets orbiting distant stars; no one even knew if such planets existed. Although for decades SETI remained the only game in town in the search for life, it always suffered from a giggle factor. More than once, congressional representatives used “the search for little green men” to whip NASA for wasting tax dollars. As a result, radio SETI’s funding suffered. The field has lived on life support for most of the past 40 years (though recent funding via the private Breakthrough Listen effort has helped).</p><p>Meanwhile, in 1995, the search-for-life game changed forever. The first planet orbiting another sunlike star was discovered, and astronomers realized that they could directly detect biosignatures by observing starlight passing through an exoplanet’s atmosphere. The development of this technique, called “atmospheric characterization,” has been one of the major successes of NASA’s astrobiology program. Astronomers recently ranked a space-based “life-finder” telescope as one of their top funding priorities in a once-in-a-decade survey of the field. Amid the clamor of biosignatures, technosignatures have often seemed like an afterthought, if they have come up at all.</p><p>The allure of biosignatures is clear. Many astronomers start out assuming that biosignatures will be more prevalent than technosignatures. After all, you can’t have a civilization-building species evolve on a planet before life does. And from Earth’s history—our only reference point on life’s path—it’s clear that basic forms of life have been around far longer than technology. Earth was sporting biosignatures for all the universe to see more than 3 billion years ago. Only over the past century or so have we begun dressing ourselves in technosignatures. That means technosignatures have been on Earth for less than 0.00001 percent as long as biosignatures have. From this perspective, technosignatures might seem like mere icing on the cake of detectable life.  </p><p>There is, however, another dimension to the question that a simple evolutionary progression fails to recognize. A new study, led by Jason Wright of Penn State University and to which I contributed as part of a NASA-funded technosignature-research group, has laid out the argument that astronomy is overlooking the value of technosignatures. The problem with biosignatures is that they’re forever tied to their biospheres—their planets. Biosignatures have no way to leave their biosphere of origin. And, for that matter, if all life were to disappear from Earth tomorrow, most of Earth’s biosignatures would disappear quickly too. For example, the oxygen in our atmosphere comes from the planet’s life. If that life went extinct, atmospheric oxygen would react back into rocks and disappear quickly on the scale of deep time.</p><p>To detect a biosignature, in other words, we have to find a fully functional biosphere. But we don’t really know how long biospheres generally last. Ours has, thankfully, persisted for more than 3 billion years. But there are many ways a biosphere might die, including the loss of the planet’s atmosphere from solar winds or a really big asteroid impact. Once the biosphere goes, the biosignatures likely go with it.</p><p>Technosignatures have no such constraint. Consider the fact that the solar system is already full of Earth’s technosignatures. More than 10 spacecraft are orbiting Mars or on its surface right now. And that’s just one planet. Hundreds of other spacecraft are out there traversing the sun’s spaceways. We have even blasted five craft entirely out of the solar system and into the interstellar domain. Every one of these machines we’ve sent into space constitutes a material technosignature—an artifact—in its own right. More important, all of the active ones are sending radio signals into space. These signals are weak, but each still constitutes a technosignature that some other species conceivably could detect.  </p><p>[Read: Seriously, what’s making all these mysterious signals in space?]</p><p>Unlike biosignatures, technosignatures move and endure. The Apollo 11 moon lander will be sitting on the moon for millions of years because there’s no wind or water to erode it away.  Projecting forward, if we were to cover a fraction of the moon with solar panels and then succumb to some civilization-crashing accident, those panels might still be visible to alien observers long after we disappeared. Meanwhile, in our own search for life, imagine an interplanetary civilization that has freighters routinely moving between worlds. Engine-exhaust plumes, tight-beam laser communications, even waste disposal, if the alien civilization burned its garbage, might show up as a signal—a signature—that we could detect on Earth. All of these technosignatures could be transmitted far from the alien civilization’s home world (let’s call it a “technosphere”). An alien civilization might even use uninhabitable worlds in its solar system to host its industry or energy generation. Such “service worlds,” as my colleagues and I call them, would only generate technosignatures, because no biosphere would be present.</p><p>Technosignatures could also be prolific. A single civilization and its technosphere could produce millions or even billions of individual objects that each could create detectable technosignatures. Imagine a civilization that is thousands or millions of years older than our own. Not only might it routinely create legions of artifacts that emit technosignatures; it might also create more technospheres. Unlike biospheres, technospheres can reproduce themselves via intentional space settlement. By these measures, imagining what distant civilizations might invent through advanced technologies, humanity so far might hardly even count as smart life.</p><p>There is plenty to argue about here. On a specific level, for instance, a critic might respond that biospheres can also reproduce via panspermia, the process when a chunk of microbe-bearing rock gets blown into space by an asteroid impact and then lands on another fertile world. Calculations show that panspermia may be relatively rare occurrences even in the best of circumstances, however. Meanwhile, a single space-faring civilization could seed the entire galaxy with new technospheres as it settled ever more distant worlds. That said, this all is speculation. We have yet to discover extraterrestrial life, so we have no idea what true ratio of smart to dumb life exists out in the cosmos. Advanced civilizations may well be so exceptionally rare that the odds are still in dumb life’s favor. I wouldn’t bet on this; but then again, so much remains undiscovered.</p><p>One misconstrued takeaway from our group’s research could be that the priority in life hunting should now shift to technosignatures. That is not, however, what we concluded. Instead, in reviewing the past biases and future possibilities, we came to see biosignatures and technosignatures as a continuum. So far, scientists have designed their life-detection tools to target either smart or dumb life, but in the wake of discovering exoplanets, the same kinds of telescopes and the same kinds of detectors attached to those telescopes can now be deployed for finding both kinds of life. These searches could even happen at the same time as astronomers look for signatures of biospheres and technology in the same parts of the electromagnetic spectrum while observing the same planet.  </p><p>The decades-old biases against technospheres, including the giggle factor tying them to little green men and UFO conspiracies, are no longer tenable. Astronomers will still have to make hard decisions based on limited resources, but those decisions should be made just on the strength of the specific search proposal rather than parsing the search for life into an artificial biosignature-versus-technosignature split. We are in truly a remarkable moment. After thousands of years of arguing over the question of life in the universe, we are finally capable of searching for answers. Finding any kind of life—dumb or smart—would constitute a fundamental reframing of our place in the cosmos. Let’s look for all of it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>President Biden on Monday bemoaned the state of U.S. airports as he touted the ways a bipartisan infrastructure law passed last year would help upgrade terminals, improve the passenger experience and reduce emissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden traveled to Boston to highlight a $62 million investment in Logan Airport through the infrastructure law. The funding will be used to modernize the international terminal of the airport and to improve roadways that keep planes circulating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The investments will create nearly 6,000 jobs, Biden said, and will help add more ticket counters in the airport, cut down time for passengers trying to make connections and reduce the time planes spend idling on the tarmac, cutting emissions in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden hailed the investments as part of a badly needed overhaul of American airports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Not a single solitary American airport, not one, ranks in the top 25 in the world,” Biden said with frustration. “The United States of America, not one airport ranks in the top 25 in the world. What in the hell is the matter with us? It means commerce. It means income. It means security. And we don’t even rank in the top 25.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden warned that the lack of infrastructure investment in recent decades had allowed competing countries like China to catch up with America economically. But he argued that the U.S. was finally investing again with the $1 trillion law passed last year with bipartisan support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill includes billions of dollars in funding for airports, some of which has already been allocated both to smaller municipal airports and major ones like Logan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Right now with this infrastructure law, America is really getting on the move again,” Biden said. “We’re moving, and your life is going to change for the better.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden has been traveling around the country in recent months to highlight projects funded by the infrastructure law, often joined by Democrats making the case to constituents that they’ve been able to get results for their communities with limited majorities in Congress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The president will also give a speech while in Boston on his administration’s “cancer moonshot” initiative, which aims to cut the death rate from cancer in half over the next 25 years.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Howard Stern says he can’t fathom how former President Trump could evade an indictment in the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) probe of the ex-commander in chief’s handling of classified documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s some crazy shit going on,” the SiriusXM host said Monday on his eponymous radio show while speaking about FBI agents finding more than 100 classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida resort home, during an August search, according to records unsealed earlier this month by the DOJ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don't know how they don't indict the dude,” Stern told his listeners, “but maybe again he'll get away with it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think there's a law in this country, and then there's no laws for Donald Trump,” Stern, 68, said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He gets away with all kinds of shit,” Stern added of Trump, who before entering the political world was a frequent guest on the broadcasting star’s radio show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump’s legal team fought a request from the DOJ to allow its review of classified materials taken from Mar-a-Lago to continue in a Monday court filing. The investigation, Trump’s lawyers said, “at its core is a document storage dispute that has spiraled out of control.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stern offered “three theories” on why Trump would have classified documents in his possession after leaving the White House.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Based on the dude I know, even when [Trump] got in office, he couldn't believe he was in office,” Stern hypothesized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When those Russian ambassadors came to visit him — if you remember early on in his administration — he started showing them top-secret documents like saying, ‘Can you believe I have access to this shit?’” Stern continued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Showing off the secret documents would “prove that he was president in a way; he doesn’t even believe it. That’s the most safe explanation,” Stern said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The radio host also speculated that Trump could’ve been holding onto the documents to secure paydays from foreign adversaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don't even think he has any idea what's in those documents,” Stern said. “He just wants them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stern also quipped that recent coverage of Queen Elizabeth II’s death last week had knocked the DOJ’s investigation out of the top story headlines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I get it, but we got to get back to Trump and where those papers are that they found at Mar-a-Lago,” he said to laughs from co-host Robin Quivers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It's so weird. I knew Donald for so many years — not in touch with him now, obviously,” Stern said of his long relationship with Trump. Stern was highly critical of Trump over his administration’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The only thing that I used to say about Donald: the guy just wants to be the focus of attention. He wants the whole world looking at him. And son of a gun, if he didn’t make that happen,” Stern said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I mean, you turn on the news. Joe Biden's the president, you don't hear a word,” Stern exclaimed. “It's about Trump, and Trump and his papers, and his documents, and the Republicans.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It's unbelievable,” Stern said of the former president and New York real estate investor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He got his wish — he just wanted everyone paying attention to him. And man, he's got to be on cloud nine, because it's all he ever wanted.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>A former federal prosecutor fired by former President Trump on Monday condemned what he described as “unprecedented” political interference in his work during the Trump administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, who served as the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, said on ABC’s “Good Morning America” that the Trump-era Justice Department pressured him to indict former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig before the midterm elections and prosecute former Secretary of State John Kerry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I've never seen anything like that before, and I was a junior prosecutor in the Southern District in the early 90s and I'd never seen anything like that,” Berman told host George Stephanopolous.“People who have been in the office for 40 years never saw anything like that. It was unprecedented and scary,” Berman added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interview came one day before Berman is set to release his book, titled “Holding the Line.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump fired Berman in June 2020 after he refused to resign, leading to what Berman described on Monday as a “noisy” departure that included him issuing a press release. Then-Attorney General William Barr accused Berman of choosing “public spectacle over public service” at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Berman’s firing came after he began investigating Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer and so-called fixer. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to campaign finance fraud and other charges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On ABC, Berman said the Justice Department attempted to get him to remove mentions of “Individual-1” in the charging documents, which were references to Trump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They were unsuccessful in that venture, and they were unsuccessful in every attempt to politically interfere with our office,” Berman said. “We held the line in every instance.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also said Trump’s Justice Department pressured him to prosecute John Kerry for his Iran-related conduct. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pressure came one day after Trump issued two tweets attacking Kerry over the Iran nuclear deal, which he helped negotiate as Obama’s secretary of State, Berman said. Trump claimed Kerry violated the Logan Act, which bans private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments without permission from the administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around the same time, Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The statute they wanted us to use was enacted in 1799 and had never been successfully prosecuted,” Berman said on ABC. “So in about 220 years this criminal statute was on the books, there were no convictions.”</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/3638643-the-us-can-use-the-abraham-accords-to-nearshore-vital-medications/",
        "description": "<p>At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, as hospital emergency rooms eclipsed capacity and states engaged in bidding wars over disposable N-95s, the American people confronted another medical crisis: they could no longer depend on access to their essential medications. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Food and Drug Administration reported shortages of more than 150 common medications, including famotidine, a popular ulcer medication, and hydrocortisone, a common steroid for treating severe allergies. Congress even passed legislation requiring the FDA to publish a medical device shortage list, which, today, includes chest drains, ventilators and defibrillators. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there have been drug and medical device shortages in the past, since the U.S. began tracking the issue in 2001, COVID-19 laid bare the alarming vulnerability to America’s pharmaceutical supply chain and its overdependence on China. The good news is that the global pandemic, combined with diplomatic breakthroughs in the Middle East, presents a unique opportunity for the United States to “nearshore” some of its pharmaceutical operations to Abraham Accords nations — specifically Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearshoring — moving the operations to a country that is geographically close and more cost-effective — our drug manufacturing, clinical trials and development will not solve all our supply chain challenges, but it will make America safer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent decades, America has experienced a decline in the percentage of domestically produced pharmaceuticals. One study found that 70 percent of the top 40 brand-name drugs sold in America were imported. Indeed, more than 95 percent of our imports of ibuprofen and 70 percent of acetaminophen — Tylenol— come from China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not merely an issue of commercial competition; this is a critical matter of national security. In her 2019 testimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Rosemary Gibson, author of “China Rx: Exposing the Risks of America's Dependence on China for Medicine,” testified that if China ceased exporting its pharmaceutical ingredients, “military hospitals and clinics would cease to function within months, if not days.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearshoring can also save money for pharmaceutical companies and, ultimately, the American consumer. Although the cost of producing pharmaceuticals in China keeps some manufacturing expenses down, we have seen over the past 30 months the devastating economic impact — and human toll — that supply chain gaps can cause. Moreover, moving drug production sites out of China could prevent intellectual property theft, which costs multinational companies trillions of dollars. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In examining the Abraham Accords countries, the UAE has considerable pharmaceutical production capabilities, including vaccines with proven scale-up potential. Recently, G42 Healthcare, an Abu Dhabi-based company, signed a letter of intent with AstraZeneca, a leading global pharmaceutical company, to expand their collaboration into the domains of diagnostics and clinical research. Morocco is quickly becoming a pharmaceutical manufacturing hub for the African continent, and many leading American pharmaceutical companies already maintain offices in Bahrain. Israel, of course, is renowned for its startup culture and game-changing life sciences breakthroughs. When Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine rolled out, clinical trials on the Israeli population delivered the most comprehensive data to American policymakers. It became the largest real-world study of COVID-19 and helped much of the world chart safety policies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The path forward is clear. The United States should first open an FDA field office in an Abraham Accords partner nation. The office could focus initially on technical assistance that would benefit the local healthcare ecosystems and serve as a fulcrum to drive new cooperative arrangements. Next, there must be a program to incentivize investments into local product development that can help fill market gaps in America. The FDA can then identify opportunities for greater American private sector investment into local research and development while accelerating our ability to lessen the Chinese stranglehold on the American medicine cabinet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pivoting our pharmaceutical supply chain away from China affords the United States the ability to reclaim control of its own drug industry and develop new technologies. The cost of production at home remains prohibitively expensive for many domestic companies and could disincentivize new drug discoveries. Bringing drug production closer to home — to the Abraham Accords countries — will strengthen America’s allies, reduce costs for medicine, and save American lives. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heather Johnston is the founder and chief executive officer of the U.S. Israel Education Association. </p>",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe month of August saw a 45 percent increase in calls, chats and text messages to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline compared to a year ago. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July, Health and Human Services (HHS) launched a new three-digit 988 number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. experienced a suicide every 11 minutes in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>More Americans are reaching out to the national 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline more than a month after the new three-digit hotline number went live.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 988 lifeline received 413,425 contacts during the month of August, through phone calls, online chat messages and text messages. That's a 45 percent increase in overall volume compared to August 2021 and about a 2 percent increase from July 2022, according to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new three-digit hotline went live July 15  to reimagine crisis response in the U.S. Individuals that need support for a suicidal, mental health and/or substance use crisis can call the hotline to seek assistance from a trained crisis counselor who can promote stabilization and care in the least restrictive setting possible.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance metrics published by HHS showed 84 percent of the 256,000 calls placed in August were answered and 16 percent were abandoned. Abandoned calls are those that are disconnected prior to being answered by a counselor.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>America is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>HHS said contacts can disconnect for a variety of reasons, for example, the individual might have changed their mind about seeking care in that moment, or they no longer have privacy or feel safe in their environment, or a technical error occurs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 64,000 chats were submitted through the lifeline’s website in August and 91 percent were answered, while just 3 percent were abandoned. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 40,000 text messages were sent to the lifeline, which had a 98 percent answer rate and 2 percent abandon rate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calls and text messages in August exceeded July metrics, except for online chats which were at about 75,000 in July 2022.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We want everyone to know that there is hope. Whether you’re experiencing thoughts of suicide, a mental health or substance use crisis, or any other emotional distress, there is compassionate, accessible care and support,” Miriam E. Delphin-Rittmon, HHS assistant secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, said in a statement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“With rising levels of anxiety, depression, and other mental illnesses – and the devastating number of overdose deaths – it is crucial that people have somewhere to turn when they’re in crisis.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. is experiencing an acute mental health crisis, with the country tallying one death by suicide every 11 minutes in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suicide was the second leading cause of death for people ages 10-14 and 25-34 in 2020, according to the CDC.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suicide rates have been growing in the U.S., with nearly half a million lives lost to suicide from 2010 to 2020. During the same period, the suicide death rate increased by 12 percent, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the nation’s mental health crisis. A 2020 survey from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) estimated about 5 percent of adults 18 years of age and older had serious thoughts of suicide, while 1.3 percent made a suicide plan and 0.5 percent attempted suicide in the past year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rates were higher among young Americans between the ages of 12 and 17, with SAMHSA finding 12 percent said they had serious thoughts of suicide, 5.3 percent made a suicide plan and 2.5 percent attempted suicide in the past year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 988 suicide hotline intends to address the country’s mental health crisis, as HHS found after speaking with a trained crisis counselor, most 988 lifeline callers are significantly more likely to feel less depressed, less suicidal, less overwhelmed and more hopeful. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available. Call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org. </p>",

Ha--breaks down crying hysterically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>TALK OF THE MORNING </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slow …It …</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*dramatic pause* </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Down … : </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via The New York Times’s Alan Feuer and Charlie Savage, “Lawyers for former President Donald J. Trump asked a federal judge on Monday to deny the Justice Department’s request to immediately restart a key of part of its criminal investigation into his hoarding of sensitive government documents at his residence in Florida.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read the 21-page filing from the NYT </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What this means: “[T]he former president’s legal team argued that seized records marked as classified should remain off limits to the F.B.I. and prosecutors. They asked the judge, Aileen M. Cannon, to maintain her order barring agents from using any of the materials taken from his estate, Mar-a-Lago, until a so-called special master has vetted all of them.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we know, via The Hill's Rebecca Beitsch</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it’s because I’m still in weekend mode, but this video of a little boy playing baseball is all I can think of.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s Monday. I’m Cate Martel with a quick recap of the morning and what’s coming up. Did someone forward this newsletter to you? Sign up here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>🔥The Jan. 6 investigation </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That may not be how to win the optics game: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former President Trump is getting pushback from Senate Republicans over his promise to pardon rioters of the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a strong ally of former President Trump in the Senate, told The Hill’s Alexander Bolton that pardoning Jan. 6 protesters is “a bad idea.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graham’s reasoning: “Pardons are given to people who admit misconduct, rehabilitate themselves. They’re not supposed to be used for other purposes.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) agrees: “I don’t think potential candidates should hold pardons out as a promise … It’s somewhat problematic for me on a moral level and an ethical level — sort of like promising other giveaways to particular individuals.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so does Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.): “If he were elected, he would have a constitutional ability to do it … I would disagree with it. I think there was insurrection and I think these folks need to be punished … I was there. This was truly violent. People were injured, people were killed. I have very little mercy for the individuals that were involved in that activity that day.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What other Senate Republicans are saying — Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) seems more open to the idea</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>🗳 On the campaign trail </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump battle royale: Two young, former Trump aides are competing in the congressional primary on Tuesday to take on incumbent Rep. Chris Pappas (D-N.H.) in November. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up: “Matt Mowers, a former Trump appointee in the State Department, has the endorsement of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), as well as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running against a former Trump staffer: “Karoline Leavitt, a 25-year-old former press aide in the Trump White House and in House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik’s (R-N.Y.) congressional office, has endorsements from Stefanik, Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), as well as from Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Lee (R-Utah).”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind: A number of other Republican candidates are running for this seat, including retired journalist Gail Huff Brown and state Rep. Tim Baxter.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What to expect, from The Hill’s Emily Brooks </p>\n\n\n\n<p>SOME OF THE NAME-CALLING IN THE RACE: The New York Times’s Annie Karni writes, “He calls her ‘fake MAGA Karoline’ from ‘the swamp.’ She calls him a ‘Fauci foot soldier’ and a ‘pharma bro.’” More on the race</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the weekend </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reread this piece every year — and it is still just as powerful: Author Garrett M. Graff published an oral history of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, told from the perspective of officials aboard Air Force One.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excerpt from then-White House senior adviser Karl Rove: “Andy and I are there with the president. The president gets this call from Cheney—we didn’t know who it was at the time, we just knew the phone rang. He said ‘yes,’ then there was a pause as he listened. Then another ‘yes.’ You had an unreal sense of time that whole day. I don’t know whether it was 10 seconds or two minutes. Then he said, ‘You have my authorization.’ Then he listens for a while longer. He closes off the conversation. He turns to us and says that he’s just authorized the shoot-down of hijacked airliners.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excerpt from Dave Wilkinson, assistant agent-in-charge at the U.S. Secret Service: “We didn’t expect the breakdown of communications. Every kind of communication that day was challenged. Even the president talking to the Situation Room was challenged. The communications network did not hold up.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read “ ‘We’re the Only Plane in the Sky’: Where was the president in the eight hours after the Sept. 11 attacks? The strange, harrowing journey of Air Force One, as told by the people who were on board.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HOW DID BIDEN MARK THE DAY? — WITH A CEREMONY AT THE PENTAGON: President Biden spoke at the National 9/11 Pentagon Memorial in Arlington, Va., on Sunday.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A memorable and timely quote: Biden referenced a quote from the late Queen Elizabeth II, who died last week. “Grief is the price we pay for love,” Biden said, quoting the late queen.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More from the 9/11 memorial event on Sunday, via CNN’s Nikki Carvajal, Jasmine Wright andKate Bennett</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>💍 In Congress </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start peddling before you hit the ground:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The House is returning to Washington, D.C., this week for a busy month before the November midterms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>^ Why I say ‘month’ instead of ‘months’: The House is not expected to meet in October, so members can campaign. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A push that’s gaining traction among lawmakers: A vote to ban lawmakers from trading stocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Senate has a stacked month, as well: The Senate is working on a bill to protect same-sex marriage after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. And the Senate is working on a government funding bill that must be passed by Sept. 30 to avoid another government shutdown. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More on what’s happening this week on Capitol Hill, via The Hill’s Mychael Schnell</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>🦠 Latest with COVID </p>\n\n\n\n<p>➤ THE COVID-19 NUMBERS </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cases to date: 94.9 million </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Death toll: 1,044,461 </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current hospitalizations: 28,826 </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shots administered: 610 million </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fully vaccinated: 67.6 percent of Americans </p>\n\n\n\n<p>CDC data here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>🐥Notable tweets </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next generation:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>AP/Victoria Jones</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ITV News’s Chris Ship tweeted, “First time we have seen the King and Queen Consort, together with the Heir to the Throne, Prince William - the new Prince of Wales.” Photo </p>\n\n\n\n<p>IF YOU’RE CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT’S HAPPENING IN DC: @bkovoDC tweeted footage of the memorial forming outside the British embassy in Washington, D.C. Video</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>⏱On tap</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The House is out.

        "title": "10 fun and useful Google search Easter eggs you should try right now",
        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/10-google-search-easter-eggs-fun-useful/",
        "description": "<p>Sometimes I simply forget how fun the hidden Easter eggs are in Google search result pages.  My favorite memory of one of these happened with the release of Avengers: End Game and Thanos’ gauntlet.  To this day, I remember that interaction with Joe like it was yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all still worked for the PR company that preceded our full-time Chrome Unboxed venture and a whole group of us took the afternoon off to go watch the final movie in the Avengers cinematic plot line.  That morning, I saw the Google Easter egg that appeared when you searched for Thanos (it made half of your search results go up in dust, but it is sadly gone now) and as we were grabbing food before heading to the theater, I excitedly told Joe all about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The look of confusion on his face was clear, and it was at this moment that I realized Joe had not watched any of the Marvel movies that came before Avengers: End Game, and I was blown away.  Explaining the fact that Thanos had snapped and turned 50% of life forms into dust, Joe began to understand the fun Easter egg.  From there, we went to the movies where he was largely confused and I was moved to tears a couple of times in the 3-hour runtime of one of the best superhero movies ever made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tell that story to highlight the fun that can be had with Google Easter eggs.  There are some that are very timely and some that are just interesting, but they are all fun.  Knowing these little hidden tricks won’t always make you more productive or give you super-powers, but they are fun things to know and show people from time to time simply just for the sake of doing it.  So let’s unpack some of my favorites I think you should try out.</p>\n\n\n\nPac-Man\n\n\n\n<p>There are quite a few of these Easter eggs that have stood the test of time, and one of those is Pac-Man in your Google search.  Simply search for ‘Pac-Man’ and you’ll see a top result that allows you to play the Pac-Man Google Doodle right away.  The board is obviously not your classic Pac-Man layout, but the game play is right on par and is fun as ever.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriends Characters\n\n\n\n<p>This one is fun and technically contains six hidden gems.  Using the full names of the characters in Friends, you can get a quick character-specific animation based on a quirk with each.  Ross’ pivot, Joey’s love for food, Monica’s cleaning habits: you get it.  Try searching all six!</p>\n\n\n\nJoey TribbianiMonica GellerRoss GellerRachel GreenChandler BingPhoebe Buffay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolitaire\n\n\n\n<p>Another fun, time-wasting game you can play with just a search is the time-honored favorite, Solitaire.  Simply search “Solitaire” and click the play button to jump into a game.  Easy mode is a one-card flip and hard mode goes to the more-standard 3-card draw.  The rest is as simple as you remember, and at your fingertips at all times, too. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlip a Coin\n\n\n\n<p>Ever need to decide something with a simple heads-or-tails result and don’t have a coin on-hand?  Google has you all taken care of if you just search “flip a coin.”  It’s simple, effective, and useful if you need it!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Mario Brothers\n\n\n\n<p>While it would be awesome if you could play a bit of Super Mario Bros. in your browser via Google search, that’s not exactly what this one does.  Searching “Super Mario Brothers” simply gives you a fun coin block in your rich search results, allowing you to click or tap it to your heart’s content and hear that iconic Mario coin sound.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTic-Tac-Toe\n\n\n\n<p>There are few games more classic than Tic-Tac-Toe.  Like Solitaire, this quick game is available with a simple “Tic-Tac-Toe” search.  You’ll have the option to play an easy, medium or ‘impossible’ opponent, or simply play a friend.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFidget or Wheel Spinner\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you just need something to do with your hands.  Fidget spinners may not be the rage they once were, but they are still fun to fiddle with for sure.  If you feel the urge to do so and don’t have a fidget spinner around, just search “fidget spinner” and you can virtually spin one on the screen.  There’s also a drop-down to allow you to spin a 6-section wheel for those times you need a random selection.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoll a Die\n\n\n\n<p>Again, many games need the roll of a die and you may or may not have one available.  Have no fear as a simple search for “roll dice” gives you a massive selection of dice with all sorts of side selections.  Pick your die and click the roll button and you’ll have your digital dice rolled.  Easy.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarrel Roll and Askew\n\n\n\n<p>Though these types of Easter eggs have been in Google for a very long time, they are still fun to know.  Simply search for “do a barrel roll” and your results page will do just that.  Search “askew” and your results page will come in a bit sideways: not enough to be unusable, but not quite straight up and down, either.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCha-Cha Slide\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, one of my favorite and most-fun Easter eggs comes in the form of the Cha-Cha Slide.  The song that has become a staple at any dance, celebration, party or wedding is deeply embedded in Google search, too, allowing you to make your search results page do all the parts of the Cha-Cha Slide at your bidding.  It’s really fun!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>That’s all for this list, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t more of these fun, hidden talents for Google’s search pages to be found.  Google adds more all the time, and there are some on this list that one day won’t be around any longer.  I hope you try all of these out and have a bit of fun with it all.  And hopefully, the next time you need to roll the dice or flip a coin, Google can help you out a bit with that sort of simple task, too.</p>\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "<p>The adventurous Tom Scott, who’s always up for a new experience, visited Aéroplume in Écausseville, France, to pilot a single-person helium blimp inside a giant warehouse. Scott was particularly surprised that he’d never heard of this before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Aéroplume, in France, is a helium blimp sized for one person. €60 gets you half an hour’s flight. I had to try it. … This isn’t sponsored: I paid for my flight at the normal price, I was the one to contact them asking permission, and Aéroplume had no editorial control. I am, however, amazed that in the ten years this has been going, no-one’s ever told me about it before!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instructor Antoine Sibué explained who invented this mode of recreational transportation, the mechanics of the blimp, and the various balloon sizes. He also showed Scott how to navigate his helium balloon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have three aéroplumes here and they are different by their volumes. We have a bigger one that can carry up to 90 kilograms, we have one that can carry up to 70 kilograms, and one that can carry up to 45. Now you can take the wings by the black handle. Everything you will do, you do it really slowly. That’s the same as if you were swimming. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott found it very easy to work the controls and compared the experience to that of a kayak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like paddling a kayak. … And if I want to turn, it’s with one? ….I didn’t feel like I was turning at all and then suddenly I was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            <p>A post shared by Aérosculpture (@aerosculpture)</p> \n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            <p>A post shared by Aérosculpture (@aerosculpture)</p>",

        "description": "<p>Extroverted people developed new strategies that helped them feel happier than those who didn’t find alternatives to socializing during COVID-19 social restrictions, according to a new study.</p>\n<p>The pandemic disrupted routine life in ways that seemed to inspire people, often seen as “the life of the party,” to adapt their social energies to new settings and situations like participating in virtual gatherings, immersion in television, movies, and books, or keeping up with their favorite influencers and celebrities.</p>\n<p>“People who used socially distanced social strategies during the pandemic felt happier than those who did not do those kinds of activities,” says Esha S. Naidu, a graduate student of psychology at the University at Buffalo. Naidu is first author of a new paper that deepens our understanding between extroversion and the need to belong, while also identifying effective social strategies for maintaining happiness when traditional options are limited.</p>\n<p>Those socially distant strategies allowed extroverts to be both social and distant, a dual tactic that provided ways of maintaining a connection to daily life, feelings that Naidu says are critical to mental and physical well-being. And though many of these activities are things people do every day, and some might be considered isolating, previous research suggests that they provide important social connections even if the participants are not consciously aware of the benefits.</p>\n<p>“During the pandemic, all of us struggled with how to navigate a new and challenging social landscape, and we might be continuing to do so as we remain COVID-cautious,” says Naidu. “Our work suggests that there are ways to find feelings of belongingness and connectedness, even when those seem to be out of reach.”</p>\n<p>Extroverts were also more likely than introverts to explore these options and engage in these kinds of activities, according to the paper’s findings, which appear in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.</p>\n<p>“We found that when extroverts were social distancing, they were more likely to use things like narratives and parasocial relationships to maintain their happiness, but when social distancing restrictions were lifted, they went back to more traditional socializing,” says Naidu.</p>\n<p>That shift, from initial adaptation followed by a return to a more normal routine, is a course introverts did not necessarily follow during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>“Introverts did not change their behavior regardless of what kinds of pandemic related restrictions were in place,” says Naidu. “Because extroverts showed this flexibility in adjusting their ways of socializing, it seems like their happiness during the pandemic was less affected than what introverts experienced.”</p>\n<p>But the findings have utility beyond the pandemic related insights they provided and can be applied to other situations that disrupt how people are accustomed to meeting their social needs.</p>\n<p>“Painful breakups or moving to a new city may have people adjusting when and how to meet their social needs,” says Naidu. “The current work suggests that extroverts might be more likely to adapt well to these kinds of situations, whereas introverts may need more encouragement or might need to be made aware of other options that are available to them—and reminded of the importance of engaging in them.”</p>\n<p>Naidu’s research team, which included Shira Gabriel, a professor of psychology, and Elaine Parvati, a graduate student of psychology, collected data using online surveys at several different time points to capture how participants’ behavior changed at different stages of the pandemic, including experiences prior to the imposition of restrictions, during the pandemic’s peak in March 2020, and one year later, when restrictions were being lifted.</p>\n<p>“The pandemic provided us with a unique context to further explore the importance of social connections at a time when the options to connect with family and friends in-person were limited,” says Naidu. “Hopefully this work can help people who are feeling isolated to remember that there are simple ways to feel connected.</p>\n<p>“As long as you seek them out!”</p>\n<p>Source: University at Buffalo</p>\n<p>The post Extroverts found new ways to connect during COVID appeared first on Futurity.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Bryan Cereijo/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>A quick review of how the Mets’ position players fared over the past week.</p> <p>The Mets’ week started off ominously, as they were shut down by Mitch Keller and the Pirates on Tuesday for the third straight loss against a bad team in which the offense was missing in action. However, with the exception of Friday’s all-around ugly loss, the Mets turned things around the rest of the week, sweeping a doubleheader from the Pirates on Wednesday and putting up back-to-back huge offensive days on Saturday and Sunday to take two out of three from the Marlins in Miami as well. Overall, because the Mets put up huge run totals in Wednesday’s night cap and Saturday and yesterday’s games, the position player meter for this week is looking pretty darn good. The notable exception is the lack of production the Mets continue to get out of the DH spot, which is made even more acute with the absence of Starling Marte’s bat in the lineup as he rehabs his fractured finger. However, this week that was offset by the Mets’ other persistent black hole having a huge week; the Mets’ catchers posted a collective 274 wRC+ this week in a sudden offensive revelation that has been missing from that position all year. </p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>This meter is absolute chaos. FIVE fireballs? In this economy? [Elmo hellfire dot gif]</p>\n<p>As I alluded to, two of those five fireballs belong to the Mets’ catching tandem, who have struggled pretty much all year long. But not this week! Tomás Nido hit his very first home run of the season in yesterday’s game, prompting the silent treatment in the dugout. It was one of six hits this week for Nido in 13 plate appearances, four of which were for extra bases—good for a blistering 326 wRC+. In total, Nido drove in three runs and scored four runs this week. James McCann was almost as good, posting a 226 wRC+ over 14 plate appearances this week and hitting the ball as well as he has all year. He collected five hits and walked three times this week, which is tied for the second-best mark on the team in walks. He drove in one run and scored four runs in total this week. No one is expecting that the Mets’ catchers will keep this up, but if they can at least give the Mets some sort of production down the stretch, it will be absolutely huge in the race for the NL East crown. </p>\n<p>Speaking of production from the bottom of the order, Eduardo Escobar is absolutely on fire right now, earning his second straight fireball for a 314 wRC+ over 27 plate appearances this week. He leads the team in hits by far this week with 13, four of which went for extra bases including three home runs—one in the day game of Wednesday’s doubleheader and one in each of Saturday and yesterday’s games. Escobar also scored six runs this week, which matches the team lead in that department, and drove in five runs in total. Escobar has now hit five home runs this month compared to just 12 the entire season prior to September and has put up a 284 wRC+ for the month of September. Escobar had been struggling so mightily that he was in the short side of a platoon with Luis Guillorme, but it’s hard to argue that situation should continue when Guillorme returns from the injured list; the Mets will likely have to find another way to get Guillorme at-bats.</p>\n<p>One of the ways they can do that is shifting Jeff McNeil to the outfield with Starling Marte having hit the injured list due to a fractured finger suffered on a hit by pitch, which would allow Escobar and Guillorme to both play on the infield. McNeil had another strong week at the plate this week, posting a 125 wRC+ over 28 plate appearances. He was one of three Mets to collect eight hits, which is second only to Escobar’s 13 for the team lead. Only one of McNeil’s eight hits went for extra bases, which is fine because McNeil is continuing to do what McNeil specializes in—hitting it where they ain’t. Despite the lack of extra base hits, McNeil’s six RBIs this week are still second-most on the team, as he continues to move the line along with men on base. McNeil also scored three runs and stole two (!!) bases this week. McNeil’s .322 batting average is now third in the league behind only Paul Goldschmidt (.325) and Freddie Freeman (.331) for the batting title.</p>\n<p>The team leader in RBIs this week is the Mets’ leadoff hitter, Brandon Nimmo; he drove in seven runs this week and put up a scorching .304/.448/.609 batting line with a 199 wRC+ in 30 plate appearances this week. Unsurprisingly, Nimmo led the Mets this week in walks as well with six. Of his seven hits this week, three went for extra bases, including two home runs—one representing the Mets’ only two runs in Tuesday’s loss and the other which got the Mets on the board in the second inning of yesterday’s game. Yesterday was a big day in general for Nimmo; he collected two hits, walked twice, and also stole his first base of the season. One of those hits should have been a triple, but he was sent back to second base on a bizarre ground rule double call by the umpiring crew. Nimmo has put together quite the season in his walk year and the Mets have made it no secret that they would like to bring him back.</p>\n<p>Rounding out our fireball brigade is Tyler Naquin, who has gotten the opportunity to play almost every day with Marte sidelined. Naquin had been struggling heading into this week, but has taken advantage of the opportunity he’s been given in a big way, posting a 202 wRC+ in 22 plate appearances. He notched six hits, half of which went for extra bases, and also walked three times. Naquin had a big game in the day game of Wednesday’s doubleheader, belting a three-run homer that put the extended the Mets’ lead to 4-0 and going 2-for-4 in the game overall. Naquin scored three runs and drove in four runs in total this week. </p>\n<p>Mark Canha was similarly productive, as he continues to thrive playing every day after getting regular days off during the early part of the season. His and Nimmo’s continued durability this season has been more important than ever as the Mets ride out Marte’s absence. Canha posted a 163 wRC+ over 27 plate appearances this week. Like Naquin, he collected six hits and three walks and half of his hits went for extra bases. Canha was right in the middle of Saturday’s offensive explosion, hitting the first grand slam of his major league career, which represents all four of his RBIs this week. Canha also scored five runs in total this week.</p>\n<p>Saturday was also a big day for Francisco Lindor, who—despite grounding into a couple of key double plays this week—posted very good numbers overall. On Saturday, Lindor went 3-for-5 and fell just a triple shy of the cycle, hitting a home run, driving in two runs, and scoring three runs. Overall, he put up a 182 wRC+ in 27 plate appearances. Like McNeil, he was one of three Mets to collect eight hits and half of those went for extra bases. He walked twice, scored five runs, and drove in five runs this week. </p>\n<p>The third Met with eight hits under his belt for the week is Pete Alonso, who showed improvement this week after a couple of rough weeks. Alonso had been in a bit of an RBI drought, but he added three to his massive total this week, bringing his season total up to 109, which is a three-way tie for second in baseball. Overall, Alonso posted a 127 wRC+ over 27 plate appearances this week. His biggest hit this week unfortunately came in a Mets loss; his two-run homer in the sixth inning of Friday’s game brought the Mets within a run, but unfortunately the Mets failed to capitalize on opportunities later in the game and some poor relief pitching let the game get out of reach. Alonso also walked once and scored two runs this week.</p>\n<p>Now to address the elephant in the room: the Mets still are getting almost nothing out of their DH spot. Darin Ruf continues to be basically hopeless at the plate and would have earned a second straight poop emoji in a larger sample size, but as it stands, he went hitless over his eight plate appearances this week. Daniel Vogelbach has not fared much better. He had just four hits—all singles—and a walk over 21 plate appearances—good for a 30 wRC+. Vogelbach scored two runs and drove in a run this week.</p>\n<p>When Starling Marte hit the injured list, the Mets brought up prospect Mark Vientos to potentially help boost production out of the DH spot, especially to make up for Ruf’s deficits. Vientos made his debut yesterday and failed to reach base in five plate appearances. </p>\n<p>Deven Marrero and Terrance Gore, who usually only come in games to pinch run or play defense, actually logged a couple of plate appearances apiece this week since the Mets had a few laughers. Neither reached base in either of their two plate appearances. </p>\n<p></p>",

Los Angeles has a magic number of two to clinch a ninth division title in ten years.</p>\n\n<p>The Dodgers have clinched a division once in Arizona, and it was quite memorable with the bulk of the 2013 team running to celebrate in the pool beyond the right field wall in Chase Field.</p>\n<p>They face a Diamondbacks team that has been playing better since just before the All-Star break. Arizona bottomed out at 13 games under .500 on July 16, but since then the D-backs are 27-21 (.563), second-best in the division to the Dodgers. During that time, LA and Arizona are the only two teams in the division to outscore their opponents in total.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers are 9-2 against the Diamondbacks this season, including 5-2 in Phoenix. They lost two of three at Chase Field from April 25-27, then the Dodgers swept four games in Arizona from May 26-29. The Dodgers also swept the D-backs in four games at Dodger Stadium from May 16-18.</p>\n<p>New in Phoenix is speedy outfielder Corbin Carroll, the club’s top prospect who was called up on August 29. Carroll has three doubles and two home runs in his first 11 major league games, hitting .275/.341/.500 with a 132 wRC+ in the early going.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers miss Arizona ace Zac Gallen this time around, since Gallen struck out 11 in six innings in a win at Coors Field on Sunday. Gallen did allow three runs, snapping his scoreless streak at 44⅓ innings, the longest streak in D-backs history. But they very likely will face Gallen when theses two teams meet for five games next week at Dodger Stadium, including a split doubleheader on Tuesday, September 20.</p>\n<p>That makes for eight games between the Dodgers and D-backs over the next 11 days.</p>\nDodgers-Diamondbacks pitching matchups\n<p>Monday: Tyler Anderson vs. Ryne Nelson6:40 p.m., SportsNet LA, MLB Network (out of market)</p>\n<p>Tuesday: Clayton Kershaw vs. Merrill Kelly6:40 p.m., SportsNet LA</p>\n<p>Wednesday: TBA vs. Zach Davies6:40 p.m., SportsNet LA</p>\n<p>Dustin May would be on four days rest on Wednesday. If the Dodgers want to insert a spot starter to give the rotation extra rest, the series finale would be the likely day it happens.</p>",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women researchers’ work has been undervalued and underrepresented in scientific and medical communities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew research details the pitfalls of this trend, as more gender-balanced research teams produce more impactful and novel ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe findings underscore the importance of gender representation when conducting scientific research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers in the scientific and medical community strive to produce novel and impactful breakthroughs with their work. One way to improve these efforts is to work in teams with a balanced number of men and women, according to a new study. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, women’s research contributions have been underrepresented, prompting the creation of organizations like the Association for Women in Science. Previous studies have also detailed gender disparities in professional conference appearances and authorship credit in scientific articles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To highlight the importance of diverse gender contributions in the medical sciences, a team of researchers from Michigan State University, Northwestern University, New York University and the University of Notre Dame assessed 6.6 million papers published by mixed-gender research teams since the year 2000. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there has been a rapid growth in gender-diverse teams throughout that time, these teams continue to be underrepresented, authors wrote, as teams still tend to have more males and fewer females. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, “despite their underrepresentation, the publications of mixed-gender teams are substantially more novel and impactful than the publications of same-gender teams of equivalent size,” they added. The finding was consistent regardless of medical subfield, or whether the team was led by a man or woman. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, teams with six or more people and an equal or close number of men and women were almost 10 percent more likely to publish novel work and nearly 15 percent more likely to be among the most-cited papers, compared with unbalanced teams.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>America is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers also found that the greater the balance of gender on a research team, the more likely that team would produce superior research, based on the factors assessed. However, they were unable to account for nonbinary authors in the current study.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This work quantifies the impact that diversity has on academic achievement,” said study co-author Teresa K. Woodruff, provost of Michigan State University, in a press release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The more diverse the environment, the better the outcome for those who fund the research and those in whose interest the work is done.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past 10 years, women’s participation in the medical sciences has exceeded that of men when it comes to graduate and postdoctoral research training, authors wrote. The results not only help recognize women’s contributions to science and the benefits of women and men working together, but also highlight how these practices improve science as a whole. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Chances are, if we had more mixed-gender teams working on pressing issues, we'd have faster breakthroughs,” added co-author Brian Uzzi of Northwestern University. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers defined novelty as the degree to which papers combined existing ideas in innovative ways, and impact was defined by the total number of paper citations. Analyses also suggested the findings could be generalizable to fields outside of medicine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We all believe that diversity increases impact, and this new paper proves that statement, here through the lens of gender and scientific productivity,” Woodruff said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research is the first of its kind to quantify the benefits of mixed-gender teams, while authors hypothesize nuanced approaches to problem solving informed by personal experience and an equity lens could account for these benefits. </p>",

        "description": "<p>As we head into crunch time for the midterms, it's important to remember that one of the great political mysteries of the past eight years remains unsolved: the undercounting of Republican or overcounting of Democratic support in polls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, several theories have been offered on why this has occurred, ranging from non-response issues, i.e., shy Trump/Republican voters, problems with likely voter models, and a lack of polling respondents without a college degree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) released their \"Task Force on 2020 Pre-Election Polling: An Evaluation of the 2020 General Election Polls\" and could not determine why public polling, on average, favored democratic candidates by 4 to 5 points in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with the polls is simple and is a known issue in the insights and opinion research industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past decade, the number of fictitious accounts, bots, and click farms employing large-scale automation to answer surveys and polls has rapidly grown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As opinion researchers have made the necessary transition to online from phone data collection, we've become dependent on panel companies recruiting compensated respondents to complete our surveys and polls. Panelists earn money by completing surveys on topics ranging from their planned auto purchases, interest in a new product, or on their voting intentions in the next election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While survey panel suppliers claim they are taking steps to curb fraudulent respondents from our polls, the industry knows bots and click farm problems are rampant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Industry research conducted in 2021 on behalf of the Insights Association found that 15 percent to 25 percent or more of completed online non-political surveys have quality issues due to:</p>\n\n\n\nIndividuals/organizations using various fictitious accountsBots and click farms employing large-scale automation to complete many surveysProfessional survey takers who are completing up to 25 surveys per day\n\n\n\n<p>These results align with other research presentations I've heard at industry conferences for years and are not a problem unique to opinion research.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spotify is plagued by click farms and fake listeners inflating the listens of a song. App stores for Apple and Google are fighting fake reviews boosting sketchy apps. Amazon's problems with phony reviews are legendary, and advertisers have long fought click fraud. Fraud is a universal problem across industries, including the opinion research industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past two years, my firm's research found that nearly a third of online poll respondents from 2020 to 2021 were not real average people. We now regularly exclude 20 percent to 30 percent of respondents from our online survey and polls via the same tools online retailers use to detect fraudulent transactions. We no longer rely upon survey panel companies to curb abusive respondents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The abusive or fraudulent poll responses we found in our polls in 2020 were more likely to indicate support for the Democratic candidate by about 5 to 7 points depending on the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Arizona, abusive responses were more likely to favor Trump in the presidential race and now Sen. Mark Kelly in the 2020 Senate race. In Michigan, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Florida, abusive respondents favored the Democratic candidates by 7 percentage points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abusive respondents are more likely to indicate they are white, male, aged 25 to 44, and to describe themselves as independents or Democrats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Male panelists are a valuable demographic. Panel companies have trouble recruiting male respondents of any age group, so there are a lot of incentives not to exclude them from panels when researchers routinely ask for 48 percent of their respondents to be male.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I've heard stories of panel providers buying fraud detection software to satisfy our industry organizations but not using them — or doing the bare minimum of quality checks — since removing questionable survey respondents would severely dent their revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How much revenue? In a billion-dollar industry currently awash in venture capital and private equity money, that adds up to $200 to $300 million in fraud each year. There are many incentives to look the other way since it's too late for many of these companies to develop a conscience after their latest round of funding.    </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, many tools and resources exist to help determine if a survey response is real, and I encourage pollsters to implement their own fraud detection tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some polls use verified voter samples, which will help. Still, I would urge my fellow researchers to implement additional measures since most of the fraud we see involves proxy servers that could mimic the address of a genuine registered voter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm genuinely worried about this fall and the aftermath of another miss in the industry. The odds that many of the current public polls are undercounting Republican support are pretty high. Our data indicate that the number of abusive respondents is growing, occurs at a higher rate among political surveys, and exists across the dozens of panel suppliers we've tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the current era of extreme polarization and declining trust in institutions, delivering authentic and accurate data has never been more critical. Another miss will only create more distrust and cries of \"fake polls,\" which is something our industry will be challenged to overcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randy Ellison, president of Targoz Market Research, is a public opinion and market research consultant.

        "description": "Charlie Morton vs. Carlos Rodon on Wednesday is a real great matchup to watch | Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>One week closer to the end, the things that were unsettled remain unsettled</p> <p>Hey y’all. How are you all doing? Besides 2022, looking forward to 2023? With the new rule changes and the continuation of expanded playoffs, I’m having a small crisis of continued interest. But that’s not what this post is about! Let’s look at the remaining playoff races, such as they are.</p>\n<p>NL East</p>\n<p>The Braves (87-53) lost an aggregate half-game on the Mets (89-52) last week, despite a brief stint in uncontested first place. This is actually not really that surprising, given that the Mets were expected to gain an extra 0.6 wins over the past week.</p>\n<p>Mets’ upcoming schedule:</p>\n\nvs CHC: Bassitt v. Assad (70%)\nvs CHC: deGrom v. Sampson (79%)\nvs CHC: Peterson v. Smyly (65%)\nvs PIT: Carrasco v. Contreras (63%)\nvs PIT: Walker v. Brubaker (59%)\nvs PIT: Bassitt v. Keller (66%)\nvs PIT: deGrom v. Wilson (79%)\nSum win probability: 4.81\n\n<p>Braves’ upcoming schedule:</p>\n\n@SF: Strider v. Cobb (58%)\n@SF: Wright v. Junis (57%)\n@SF: Morton v. Rodon (50%)\nvs PHI: Fried v. Suarez (61%)\nvs PHI: Odorizzi v. Nola (48%)\nvs PHI: Strider v. Falter (67%)\nSum win probability: 3.41\n\n<p>This part of the schedule does not look too favorable for the Braves in terms of making up ground, so they’ll really need the Cubs and Pirates to do something. The Braves likely have to face two fWAR pitching leaders in Carlos Rodon and Aaron Nola this week, while the Mets’ toughest matchup involves... J.T. Brubaker? Being three games back coming into next Monday seems like the default, so there’s work to do.</p>\n<p>Last 2 NL Wild Card Spots</p>\n<p>Current status: Phillies (78-62) lead Padres (77-64) by 1.5 for fifth seed; Brewers (75-66) trail sixth seed by 2.0 games.</p>\n\nPhillies: 3 @ MIA, 3 @ ATL; sum win probability = 2.63\nPadres: 2 @ SEA, 4 @ ARI; sum win probability = 2.89\nBrewers: 2 @ STL; 3 vs NYY; sum win probability = 3.25\n\n<p>The Brewers didn’t do enough with a favorable schedule last week and remain a few games out of a spot; the Phillies actually took advantage of easier matchups and didn’t falter too badly against some good pitching to leapfrog the Padres for the fifth spot.</p>\n<p>Still, the Brewers have another chance to make some hay, since they’re the only team of the three with home games this week. The Phillies have a series of absolutely brutal matchups this week (Bailey Falter vs. Sandy Alcantara and Spencer Strider, Ranger Suarez vs. Max Fried), but the Padres don’t have it that much easier.</p>\n<p>AL East and Wild Card Spots</p>\n<p>(Excluding the Orioles, who went 2-5 last week to probably end any realistic playoff hopes)</p>\n<p>Current status: Yankees (85-56) lead Rays (78-60) by 5.5; Blue Jays (78-61) by 6.0.</p>\n<p>Mariners (76-58) are tied with the Blue Jays and half game ahead of the Rays for the Wild Card seeding. Mariners hold the tiebreaker over the Blue Jays, Rays hold tiebreaker over the Mariners, Blue Jays and Rays have nine games left against one another.</p>\n\nYankees: 2 @ BOS; 3 @ MIL; sum win probability = 2.33\nRays: 5 @ TOR; 3 vs. TEX; sum win probability = 4.18\nBlue Jays: 5 vs. TB; 3 vs. BAL; sum win probability = 4.77\nMariners: 2 vs. SDP; 3 @ LAA; sum win probability = 2.63\n\n<p>The sum win probabilities are a little misleading, because the Rays and Blue Jays play three more games each here than the Yankees or Mariners, including a five-game set against one another. This could either continue the morass, or give one team a decisive leg up in the Wild Card standings. It looks like that could be the Blue Jays, and they’re likely a much better team on paper at this point, but the Rays continue to defy high-level, on-paper analyses.</p>\n<p>The Yankees will have to slide substantially to lose their division lead at this point, as they only have three games left with the Jays and none with the Rays.</p>\n<p>AL Central</p>\n<p>Current status: Guardians (73-65) lead White Sox (72-69) by 2.5 games and Twins (69-70) by 4.5 games.</p>\n\nGuardians: 3 vs. LAA; 4 vs. MIN; sum win probability = 4.13\nWhite Sox: 2 vs. COL; 3 @ DET; sum win probability = 2.90\nTwins: 3 vs. KCR; 4 @ CLE; sum win probability = 3.10\n\n<p>The Twins really ate it last week, losing a share of first and an above-.500 record as they went 1-6 and got swept by the Guardians. The good news is that they have another chance to redeem themselves with a five-game set in Cleveland (the fifth game is on Monday and not counted n the above). The bad news is that most of the pitching matchups in that critical series look awful for Minnesota, so good luck with that. The White Sox actually got above .500 (again) and could sneak in to the division lead if their competitors split four games or something, but the problem is that the pitching matchups for them in Detroit aren’t awesome as they’re throwing both Michael Kopech and Dylan Cease versus the Rockies.</p>\n<p>Non-Braves games to watch (assuming pitching matchups hold):</p>\n\nTuesday: Padres @ Mariners, Yu Darvish v. Logan Gilbert. Not too much to say here — two good starters in a game that has implications for multiple races.\nWednesday: Rays @ Blue Jays, Drew Rasmussen v. Ross Stripling. Morton versus Rodon is the real must-watch on this day, but this is non-Braves games, so check out two guys you probably weren’t aware have been quite so good in a head-to-head matchup with Wild Card seeding implications. (Yes, I am tired of the only real intrigue being seeding, are you?) \nThursday: Phillies @ Marlins, Noah Syndergaard v. Pablo Lopez. Lopez has really struggled lately, which gives the Phillies perhaps a bit more breathing room than earlier in the series, where they face Sandy Alcantara and Edward Cabrera. This could be a big game for the Phillies to win if they want to avoid feeling more pressure of falling out of the playoffs, though honestly the Brewers need to start playing way better for that to be a real possibility.\nFriday: Yankees @ Brewers, Frankie Montas vs. Adrian Houser. Another matchup with implications for multiple races. Montas continues to struggle in pinstripes; Houser mostly just eats innings. This one could really go either way, which is why it’s the pick.\nSaturday: Padres @ Diamondbacks, Sean Manaea vs. Ryne Nelson. Nelson had an amazing debut, blanking the Padres for seven innings with a 7/0 K/BB ratio. Can the Padres get some revenge? This is another one of the games, like the Thursday game, where it could matter a ton if the Brewers actually get their butts in gear, but they really haven’t yet.\nSunday: Mariners @ Angels, Marco Gonzales vs. Tucker Davidson. Forgotten among all the dramatics last night was that Gonzales had something like his second-best start of the year against the high-octane Atlanta offense. Davidson has been pretty awful for the Angels, so this game could have a lot of fireworks.\n\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

In ways big and small, Democrats have been trying to signal their independence from the White House, without alienating their base or distancing themselves from key parts of Mr. Biden’s agenda.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a dynamic that presidents often confront in midterm cycles.

        "description": "<p>Some female white-necked jacobin hummingbirds have male-like plumage and mimic male appearance—but not male behavior, researchers report.</p>\n<p>In addition, their strength and body size are similar not to males, but to fellow females with muted plumage.</p>\n<p>White-necked jacobin hummingbirds sport a colorful blue-and-white plumage as juveniles. When they grow into adulthood, males retain this dazzling pattern, while females develop a more “muted” palette of green and white—at least, most females.</p>\n<p>Curiously, about 20% of females defy the norm and retain male-like plumage into adulthood.</p>\n<p>“Why do some female jacobins look like males? It’s a mystery made up of multiple pieces,” says Jay Falk, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington. “Is there a benefit? Is there a cost? Is it just appearance, or do these females also act like males?”</p>\n<p>With the findings of a new study, those puzzle pieces are falling into place.</p>\nThese male hummingbirds are big bullies\n<p>The study shows that the 1 in 5 adult females with male-like plumage are engaging in “deceptive mimicry.” They are essentially trying to pass themselves off as males, without acting like them.</p>\n<p>In the process they receive quite a benefit. As Falk and his colleagues reported in a paper published last year in Current Biology, females with male-like plumage suffer less aggression from males compared to females with the more typical muted plumage, and can hang out longer at feeders.</p>\n<p>Falk began this research as a graduate student at Cornell University and continued it as a postdoctoral fellow with coauthor Alejandro Rico-Guevara, an assistant professor of biology and curator of ornithology at the Burke Museum of Natural History &amp; Culture.</p>\n<p>White-necked jacobins are common in tropical lowlands of the Americas. Males of this species, put simply, are bullies. They defend territories, chase rivals away from food sources, court females, and fight. That aggressive behavior relies on an underlying difference in body size and physiology: Male jacobins are larger and are better at combative flight compared to dull-colored females.</p>\n<p>An unanswered question from Falk’s previous study was whether females with male-plumage also displayed male-like flight power or behavior. At a field site in Panama, he briefly captured male jacobins and females with both types of plumage.</p>\n<p>He discovered that females—regardless of plumage—had essentially identical body and wing sizes, whereas males were slightly larger. Before releasing the birds, Falk also tested their “burst power”—or muscle capacity during flight—by seeing how high they could fly while lifting a chain of small, weighted beads. Females of both types of plumage had identical burst power, while males could lift more on average.</p>\n<p>Using data from radio-tagged birds in the wild, the team also discovered that more males fed in a “territorial” pattern—spending longer amounts of time at a smaller number of feeding sites. All females, regardless of plumage, showed the opposite pattern: feeding for shorter periods of time at sites across a larger territory.</p>\n<p>“Females with male-like plumage don’t seem to be behaving any differently than other females,” says Falk. “All evidence instead indicates that females that look like males are engaging in deceptive mimicry.”</p>\nOther species use deceptive mimicry, too\n<p>Many examples of deceptive mimicry occur between species: a harmless species will mimic the coloration of a noxious species as an anti-predator defense.</p>\n<p>In the Americas, for example, some non-venomous kingsnake species have evolved colorful banding patterns that resemble venomous species in the same area, such as coral snakes. Research showed that this deceptive mimicry decreased predation of the kingsnakes, which are not venomous. What Falk and his colleagues found in white-necked jacobins appears to be an example of deceptive mimicry within a species.</p>\n<p>Scientists have reported females with male-like plumage in other hummingbird species. If so, male mimicry within hummingbird species may be more common than currently known. Next year, Falk will move to the University of Colorado Boulder to study the genetic differences between females with muted and male-like plumage—and potentially identify how this deception evolved.</p>\n<p>But differences between the sexes are not the whole story.</p>\n<p>“Even when I found average differences in female and male morphology, burst power, or behavior, I also found quite a bit of overlap between the sexes,” says Falk. “That indicates that sex isn’t the only important factor, and that variation among and between individuals plays an important role.”</p>\n<p>Falk and Rico-Guevara are currently studying the role of individual variation in these traits, regardless of sex.</p>\n<p>The study appears in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Additional coauthors are from Cornell University, Columbia University, and the University of Washington.</p>\n<p>The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, National Science Foundation, Cornell University, the Walt Halperin Endowed Professorship at the University of Washington, the Washington Research Foundation, the Society for the Study of Evolution, and the American Society of Naturalists funded the work.</p>\n<p>Source: University of Washington</p>\n<p>The post Female hummingbirds evolved a trick to keep males at bay appeared first on Futurity.</p>",

The stunning, lightning offensive by Ukrainian troops in the north-east of the country constitutes the most significant moment in the war since March, when Vladimir Putin’s assault on Kyiv was repulsed and his invading forces beat a hasty retreat eastwards.</p><p>Over five days, thousands of square kilometres of the occupied east, including the strategically vital cities of Kupiansk and Izium, have been liberated. According to Ukrainian commanders, Russian troops have been pushed back to the border. The Institute for the Study of War estimates that the counteroffensive has taken control of more territory than Russian forces have managed in all operations since April. Skilful use of western rockets and artillery allowed the Ukrainian military to successfully target Russian supply lines and erode its massive advantage in military hardware. Already low in morale – and lacking elite combat troops who had been dispatched to deal with a prior offensive in the south – Russian fighters abandoned overnight territory that had been won after weeks of attritional warfare.</p> Continue reading...",

A Daniel Vogelbach sighting! | Photo by Justin Berl/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The Cubs take a quick one-series road trip to New York.</p> <p>The Mets took three of four from the Cubs at Wrigley Field just before the All-Star break.</p>\n<p>Since the break the Mets are 31-17 while the Cubs are 23-25.</p>\n<p>For more on the Mets, here’s Chris McShane, managing editor of our SB Nation Mets site Amazin’ Avenue:</p>\n\n<p>The New York Mets remain a very good team this year. Despite the fact that Max Scherzer and Starling Marte are on the injured list at the moment, the team should be expected to at least take this series from the Cubs. After all, they’ve spent all but two days of the season in sole possession of first place in the National League East. </p>\n<p>You’re going to see the very good Chris Bassitt, the best pitcher of this generation in Jacob deGrom, and the left-handed David Peterson in this series, and as long as the Mets’ offense is relatively functional, the series should go as expected.</p>\n\nFun fact\n<p>Since 2015, the Cubs are 29-16 against the Mets, including a 12-9 record at Citi Field. </p>\nProbable pitching matchups \n<p>Monday: Javier Assad, RHP (0-1, 2.93 ERA, 1.435 WHIP, 4.62 FIP) vs. Chris Bassitt, RHP (13-7, 3.24 ERA, 1.134 WHIP, 3.40 FIP)</p>\n<p>Tuesday: Adrian Sampson, RHP (1-5, 3.76 ERA, 1.291 WHIP, 3.82 FIP) vs. Jacob deGrom, RHP (5-1, 1.66 ERA, 0.554 WHIP, 1.39 FIP)</p>\n<p>Wednesday: Drew Smyly, LHP (6-8, 3.57 ERA, 1.200 WHIP, 4.31 FIP) vs. David Peterson, LHP (7-4, 3.47 ERA, 1.328 WHIP, 3.59 FIP)</p>\nTimes &amp; TV channels\n<p>Monday: 6:10 p.m. CT, Marquee Sports Network</p>\n<p>Tuesday: 6:10 p.m. CT, Marquee Sports Network</p>\n<p>Wednesday: 6:10 p.m. CT, Marquee Sports Network</p>\nPrediction\n<p>Our old buddy Daniel Vogelbach (pictured above) is now a Met. He’s hit .234/.366/.405 in 134 PA with the Mets, and his .771 OPS is almost identical to the .769 he posted with the Pirates this year. </p>\n<p>I mention that just because Vogelbach has been a BCB favorite for years. Really, all I wanted to say here is: “Hey, Cubs! Psst! Please don’t get swept.”</p>\nUp next\n<p>The Cubs have Thursday off, then return to Wrigley Field to host the Colorado Rockies in a three-game series beginning Friday afternoon.</p>\n\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>Nothing is less fun than a fun fact. The mandate to share one about yourself, typically posed as an icebreaker in schools, offices, and other formal settings, is deeply constraining. The form demands a tidbit that’s honest without being overly revealing, interesting but never indecent, unique but not weird. Within such parameters, it’s virtually impossible not to come off as either hopelessly boring or a complete fool. And the stakes for striking the right balance are high, given that the fact someone shares may very well be the most personal information their co-workers (or fellow students or teammates) ever learn about them.</p><p>The goals of such an exercise may be noble, aiming to let group members get to know one another in a more human way before they have to work or study together. But rather than putting people at ease, too often these prompts only create more discomfort. Work and school are already stressful, and the pressure to make a good impression is high. When it’s required, fun just isn’t that fun anymore.</p><p>Psychology can lend some insight into why such activities can feel so painful. For one, people typically aren’t given much time to prepare. Having something sprung upon you—especially something that you might be judged for—without warning can incite stress and perhaps trigger the fight-or-flight response. Even after you’ve decided what you’ll say, the act of sharing is essentially an instance of public speaking: a major source of anxiety for many people. When we meet a new person, we’re constantly trying to gauge how they’re reacting to us, Erica Boothby, a lecturer in the operations, information, and decisions department at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, told me. Introducing yourself to a group demands that you evaluate how every single member responds to you—an overwhelming task. You’re unlikely to come to positive conclusions. “When people have a conversation with someone new, they tend to overestimate, basically, how harshly they’re being judged by those people,” Boothby explained. This phenomenon is known as the liking gap, and it’s even stronger in shy people.</p><p>[Read: Teens are protesting in-class presentations]</p><p>Seen another way, the liking gap can be comforting: People like you more than you suspect they will. This means your listeners probably didn’t find your fun fact as inane as you feared, and likely enjoyed getting to know you. “We’re the most social of all primates,” Nick Epley, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, told me—but still, “people tend to underestimate just how social others are.” Epley pointed out that even basic self-disclosures through fun facts could facilitate bonding.</p><p>Indeed, liking one’s co-workers does enhance career satisfaction; people who have friends at work tend to enjoy their role more. But trying to make connections while under the boss’s eye has a way of stripping all of the enjoyment out of the process. As the management scholar Stephen Fineman wrote, “Fun typically gains its ‘funness’ from its spontaneity, surprise, and often subversion of the extant order”—the exact opposite of following your manager’s orders, in other words.</p><p>Although icebreakers might not always be pleasurable, some research does indicate that they can be good for workplace productivity. One 2000 study found that playing name games actually helps people remember others’ names, which makes working together easier. Another showed that sharing embarrassing stories about oneself led to more creative brainstorming—perhaps because the activity preemptively alleviated any fears of humiliation that might have kept people from sharing their most daring ideas.</p><p>Turning forced humiliation into something employees actually enjoy might be unrealistic, but, under the right conditions, it is possible to have a good time with office games. Ethan Mollick and Nancy Rothbard, two professors at Wharton, found that when employees consent to an activity, partaking in it does make them happier—something that has been true in my own experience as well. A colleague I used to work closely with loves starting meetings with inventive ice-breaking prompts—the weirder, the better. But I actually enjoyed her icebreakers, for a few reasons. For one, she wasn’t my boss, and she used these in small groups where we all already knew one another—so the pressure to perform was low. She also always ran a couple of ideas past the group; we’d settle on one together. In response to her prompts, I’ve revealed my Starbucks order and argued the case for which pasta shape I most embody and why. Never once did she dare suggest that we merely share a bland fun fact about ourselves.</p><p>The idea that requiring each member of a group to volunteer a fun fact about themselves is the only way to kick off a class or corporate retreat or sports practice is a delusion. We need to dispense with these awkward, forced personal disclosures. I doubt anyone would mind simply sharing their name, saving themselves the pressure of coming up with something extra to say and instead just getting their work done more quickly. Research shows that the single most important factor driving employee morale is making meaningful progress, and if skipping an icebreaker means ending the day a bit early, no one would complain.</p><p>[Read: The surprising benefits of talking to strangers]</p><p>But after we liberate ourselves from fun facts, there might be some room to get to know one another in a way that’s more genuine and comfortable for all involved. When I asked Mollick, who teaches at Wharton, whether he’d ever opened a course with an icebreaker, he admitted that he does use them—reluctantly. But he likes more creative prompts, such as asking what item a student would bring to a desert island; sometimes he even has his class play a video game together. Similarly, although Boothby and Epley both eschew traditional icebreakers, they encourage their students to get to know one another. Boothby tends to open her courses by arranging one-on-one conversations between seat neighbors; she gives few instructions, allowing them to talk about whatever they want. During a business-school orientation, Epley paired off classmates to discuss three or four intimate questions, based on the evidence that people much prefer deep talk to small talk.</p><p>I wouldn’t mind a game like Mollick’s, and I genuinely enjoy one-on-one conversations with someone new. Beyond the confines of the fun fact, which demands that you be interesting without offering any appeal of its own, I’m not a complete grinch. People are wonderful and weird, and I love getting to know them—especially when it’s on our terms.</p>",

(credit: Intel)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Intel’s slow, steady drip of information about its upcoming Arc GPUs continued last week when the company released the final specs for its four A-series desktop graphics cards. As with the laptop GPUs the company announced earlier this year, the desktop Arc cards are split between the entry-level Arc 3, midrange Arc 5, and high-end Arc 7 tiers.</p>\n\n<p>The only Arc GPU that has been extensively vetted by independent testers is the entry-level A380, which is also the only one that has had any kind of official launch in the US (this back-ordered $140 ASRock Challenger model listed on Newegg, not counting more expensive cards imported from China). It's by far the weakest GPU in the lineup, with just eight of Intel's Xe cores and ray tracing units and 6GB of GDDR6 memory on a 96-bit memory bus. Reviews usually show the A380 trading blows with older and budget-focused GPUs like Nvidia's GTX 1650 or AMD's RX 6400, depending on the game.</p>\n<p>The Arc 5 and Arc 7 cards are all based on the same die, with more GPU cores shut off for the lower-end versions. (credit: Intel)</p>\n<p>The other three GPUs are all a lot more similar. The A580, A750, and A770 have 24, 28, and 32 Xe cores, respectively, all increasing in clock speed as you climb upward. But they all share a 256-bit memory bus and 8GB of GDDR6 RAM (with a 16GB option available for the A770). Intel showed off its own \"Limited Edition\" first-party versions of the A770 and A750; they share the same basic board and fan design and 225 W board power, but the A770 has built-in LEDs, and the A750 doesn't. Intel is presumably leaving the lower-end A580 and A380 cards to its board partners, rather than making its own versions.</p><p>Read 5 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

Starlink called the funding reversal \"grossly unfair\" and \"flawed as a matter of both law and policy.\"</p>\n<p>The appeal submitted Friday asks the commission to undo the FCC's Wireline Competition Bureau ruling from last month.

One vehicle was a static \"show car,\" and when a man in pink pants and a polo shirt with a popped collar tried to find a way to open a door, a product specialist flapped him away. Truthfully, even if you could figure out a way to open the doors, there weren't any handles to grab.</p>\n<p>Plenty of people milled down the hill from where the more established automakers had taken up residence to stop and gawk at the pair of FF91 pre-production vehicles, one giving rides around the block in Pebble Beach traffic—mixing with Koeniseggs, McLarens, and Ferraris—and the other hulking across two parking spots, with the doors on the passenger side open to passers-by.</p>\n<p>The weirdly shaped vehicle stood out in a sea of low-slung supercars crawling all over the bucolic, fog-shrouded Pebble Beach peninsula. The color of both the display and test vehicles was white, so they looked like refrigerators in a sea of praying mantises.

Throughout the year we ask questions of the most plugged-in Milwaukee Brewers fans and fans across the country. Sign up here to participate.</p>\n<p>In last week’s SB Nation Reacts survey, we asked fans what they thought of the new 2023 schedule format with fewer divisional games and more interleague matchups. Roughly two-thirds of fans said they like the new schedule format (Note: we know the graphic misstates this).</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>We also asked fans what AL team they’re most excited to see come to American Family Field, with options including the Angels, Red Sox, Astros, Orioles, Tigers, Royals, A’s and Twins. 35% of fans voted for the Angels, followed by the Red Sox at 21% and Astros at 18%.</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>What would you like us to ask in a fan poll this week?

        "description": "<p>The Red Sox have claimed infielder Yu Chang off waivers from the Rays, according to Chris Cotillo of MassLive. Chang had been designated for assignment last week. In a corresponding move, outfielder Jaylin Davis has been designated for assignment by Boston.</p>\n<p>Chang, 28, has been a fixture of transaction logs this year, now joining his fourth organization of the season. He began the year with the Guardians but was designated for assignment in late May. He got traded to the Pirates for cash considerations but was designated for assignment again after a month in Pittsburgh. The Rays claimed him off waives from the Bucs and have kept him around for the past two months.</p>\n<p>Chang was a fairly well regarded prospect but hasn’t yet had strong results in the major leagues. Since he is out of options and can’t be sent to the minors, he’s been continually nudged off rosters all year, with some other club always stepping up to give him another shot. His overall batting line this year is .216/.280/.324 for a wRC+ of 77. He has been better in recent months with the Rays, however, hitting .260/.305/.385 for a wRC+ of 101. Whether Chang’s bat has turned a corner or not, he will at least provide defensive versatility, having spent some time at each of the four infield positions this year.</p>\n<p>The Red Sox are 69-72 on the year, leaving them 10 games out of a playoff spot with just over three weeks remaining on the schedule. With their hopes of competing effectively dashed at this point, they can use their remaining games to evaluate players prior to the winter, with Chang now entering the mix. The club’s current infield picture includes Xander Bogaerts, Trevor Story, Rafael Devers, Triston Casas and Christian Arroyo, with Bogaerts expected to opt out of his contract and become a free agent this winter. The Sox make sense as a fit for a free agent shortstop to replace Bogaerts, though if they don’t succeed in signing one, they could also slide Story over and make Arroyo the everyday second baseman. That would give Chang a path to a job as a utility/bench infielder.</p>\n<p>As for Davis, 28, the Red Sox claimed him from the Giants in April but passed him through waivers a couple weeks later. He was selected back to the roster in July. He has a great batting line in the majors though in a tiny sample of just 27 plate appearances. He’s hit .333/.407/.375 in the bigs this year despite striking out 40.7% of the time. He’s hit just .198/.315/.318 for Triple-A Worcester while going down on strikes in in 30.8% of his 305 plate appearances. Since the trade deadline has passed, the Sox will have no choice but to put him on outright waivers or release waivers in the coming days. Since Davis was previously outrighted, he’d have the ability to reject an assignment and elect free agency in the event he clears waivers again.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Negotiators from Iran, the United States and the European Union have once again nearly concluded indirect talks over the “final text” of a nuclear deal. Like the 2015 deal formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the new deal imposes temporary restrictions on the Iranian nuclear program in exchange for broad sanctions relief.  Though the talks appear to have reached another impasse, they could rapidly conclude in the coming weeks if Iran decides to show flexibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it prepares to market the deal to a skeptical Congress, the Biden administration has hinted that negotiations in Vienna did not result in a new agreement, but merely all sides returning to compliance with the JCPOA. This may seem likely a purely semantic point but may actually be a calculated effort to avoid a congressional vote after a review of the nuclear deal, as required by the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (INARA).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May, the State Department Special Representative for Iran Rob Malley pledged to submit any prospective agreement with Iran for congressional review. INARA specifies that within five calendar days after reaching any agreement with Iran relating to its nuclear program, the president must transmit the full agreement to Congress. INARA also lays out procedures for congressional review and an expedited process for voting on the deal if Congress so chooses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Biden administration may still be hoping to avoid a congressional vote by claiming that it is merely returning to the JCPOA, which went through the INARA review process in 2015. Thus, the White House may try to argue that, while they are submitting the text of an agreement for review there is no need for Congress to vote on it again. Democratic leadership in Congress may be tempted to indulge in such an argument and use their majority positions to avoid a tough vote as the midterms approach. That would be a dereliction of Congress’ important oversight role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The authors of INARA anticipated chicanery from the executive branch. Congress enacted the law in 2015 while the JCPOA was in the final stages of negotiations. Once the Obama administration made clear its intent to circumvent Congress and not submit the agreement as a treaty, lawmakers of both parties demanded a say, noting the scale of U.S. commitments under the deal. An overwhelming majority of Congress — 98 senators and 400 House members — ultimately voted to pass INARA, thereby ensuring their ability to review the agreement. Crucially, Congress took pains to define the term “agreement” broadly to prevent the Obama administration from circumventing lawmakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under INARA, the term “agreement” means an agreement “related to the nuclear program of Iran that includes the United States, commits the United States to act, or in which the United States commits or otherwise agrees to act, regardless of the form it takes.” The president must transmit that agreement regardless of whether it is legally binding or merely a political commitment. Finally, the administration must transmit additional materials related to any agreement, including annexes, appendices, codicils, side agreements, implementing materials, documents and guidance, technical or other understandings, and any related agreements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The terms of the new agreement with Iran are not yet public, but reportedly involve substantial amendments to the JCPOA. That should not be surprising. The Trump administration pulled out of the JCPOA more than four years ago, so Washington and Tehran cannot just flip a switch and go back to the way things were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a statutory point of view, reentering a substantially amended agreement effectively amounts to “reaching an agreement” under INARA, thereby triggering the law’s transmittal and review requirements. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the period in which Congress reviews and votes on the new agreement, the administration cannot provide sanctions relief from measures imposed by Congress, which greatly curtails the administration’s flexibility in providing Tehran immediate, unobstructed benefits. That is one reason the administration wants to get around INARA. They have apparently found another way: according to leaked audio from the lead Iranian negotiator, prior to submitting the deal to Congress the Biden administration will simply lift or suspend three executive orders relating to Iran.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We reconstructed the details using other public Iranian and U.S. government documents and found that this would result in the lifting of over 170 sanctions on critical Iranian banks, terrorists and foreign sanctions evaders. This includes sanctions relief for Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, and senior IRGC generals responsible for the 1983 Beirut Barracks bombing and the 1994 AMIA bombing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the Biden administration enters the deal without due consideration and action by Congress, House and Senate members could initiate a lawsuit against the president. According to the Congressional Research Service’s 2014 study, based on the Supreme Court’s guidelines in Raines v. Byrd, individual members of Congress have legal standing against the executive branch when they have suffered an “institutional injury” that amounts to vote nullification in the past or future. Since INARA lays out the procedure for voting on nuclear agreements and provides an expedited vote, a court may find that evading the law amounts to vote nullification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If members of Congress filed suit against the administration for injunctive relief, it could delay further sanctions relief, would raise the profile of the JCPOA’s deficiencies and draw attention to provisions in the deal that the Biden administration may be hesitant to publicize. It could also prove as a useful dilatory tool to permit a full accounting of the hidden concessions and side deals rumored to come, such as a widely-reported $7 billion hostage payment for the release of 4 American citizens — a rumor the administration has denied.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Iranians pay close attention to the sentiments of Congress — in fact, Iranian officials frequently cite objections from Congress as reasons against rejoining the JCPOA. Even if the effort fails, this vote would send an extraordinary message to the regime and the international business community that any deal struck would not survive by any future Republican administration. Ultimately, it is risk-averse businesses and their leadership, not politicians, who make investment decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This vote and its message would severely temper any economic investment in Iran (having a similar effect to sanctions), could prove to be a death knell for these misguided negotiations and would set the stage for the next administration to take a stronger approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthew Zweig, former senior advisor at the U.S. State Department’s Office of the Special Representative for Syria Engagement and senior professional staff member at the House Foreign Affairs Committee is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a nonpartisan research institute focused on national security and foreign policy. Gabriel Noronha is a fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA) and previously served as the State Department’s special advisor for Iran from 2019-2021. He also served in the Senate Armed Services Committee from 2017-2019.</p>",

Wade, leading to several states in the U.S. enacting total or near-total abortion bans. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' concurring opinion sparked concerns that protected access to contraceptives could also be overturned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The House in July passed the Right to Contraception Act, with eight Republicans joining Democrats in voting yes. The bill would codify access to contraception — including oral birth control, condoms and intrauterine devices — on the federal level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senate Democrats Ed Markey (Mass.), Patty Murray (Wash.), Mazie Hirono (Hawaii) and Tammy Duckworth (Ill.) sought unanimous consent to quickly pass the bill in July, but were blocked by Republican Sen. Joni Ernst (Iowa), though she herself has expressed support for expanded birth control access. Ernst argued that the bill went beyond just guaranteeing access to contraception.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The House is kicking off phase III of its reopening plan on Monday, which includes allowing tours of the floor, marking the chamber’s latest step toward normalcy after the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the building to the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>House Sergeant at Arms William Walker sent a memo to House members and staff on Monday announcing the beginning of phase III. The decision to move to phase III was made in coordination with congressional leadership, the U.S. Capitol Police Board, the attending physician, the U.S. Capitol Police and Capitol Visitor Services, according to the memo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Beginning the week of Monday, September 12, 2022, the next phase of the Capitol reopening to tours will begin,” Walker wrote in the memo, which was obtained by The Hill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under phase III guidelines, members are now permitted to lead tours on the House floor while the chamber is out of session. Tours on the floor will stop 30 minutes before the chamber is scheduled to begin legislative business. Congressional spouses, former lawmakers and staff are not permitted to lead tours on the floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawmakers are also now permitted to bring guests to the House galleries while the chamber is in session. A representative or a member of their staff must remain with the guests at all times while in the gallery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, with phase III of the reopening plan in full swing, former members of the House are now permitted to conduct tours throughout the Capitol, though groups cannot exceed 50 people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monday’s phase III reopening comes exactly 2 1/2 years after the Capitol shut down to the public because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phased reopening of the Capitol began in March, allowing a limited number of tours throughout the Capitol led by lawmakers and staff. School group visits were also permitted in that wave. Phase II began at the end of May, reopening the Capitol Visitor Center and extending times available for tours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group tours led by guides and staff will continue to be available in the Capitol, in addition to member-led tours. Dome tours are also still permitted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hill reached out to the sergeant at arms’ office to inquire if phase III is the final part of the Capitol’s reopening plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger in March said staffing shortages within the force were delaying the reopening of the Capitol building. He told Politico last month that the department is “at least 300 short of where I would like us to be ultimately.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have put all the things in place that we need to put into place to turn the tide on our staffing, and we now have gotten ahead of attrition. So we are now adding people — we now have more people than we had … at our lowest point, and we continue to add people each month,” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The House lifted its mask mandate in February, before President Biden delivered his State of the Union address.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reps. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) announced last week that they tested positive for COVID-19.</p>",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMontana’s Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) has adopted a rule that effectively prohibits transgender people with from changing the sex designation on their state-issued birth certificates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the new rule, a person’s sex on their birth certificate can be altered only if it was listed incorrectly \"as a result of a scrivener's error or a data entry error” or if the individual’s sex was “misidentified on the original certificate.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rule took effect Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Montana health officials have adopted a proposed rule that prevents transgender people in most cases from changing their sex designation on state-issued birth certificates — even if they receive gender-affirming medical or surgical care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rule adopted Friday by the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) allows for the sex that is listed on an individual’s birth certificate to be altered only if it was listed incorrectly \"as a result of a scrivener's error or a data entry error” or if the individual’s sex was “misidentified on the original certificate.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of the latter, DPHHS must be in possession of a correction affidavit and supporting documentation including copies of chromosomal, DNA or genetic testing that “identify the sex of the individual” in order to make the change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rule went into effect on Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>America is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A Montana judge in April blocked state officials from enforcing a 2021 law that allows DPHHS to amend an individual’s sex designation on their birth certificate only if the department receives a court order indicating that the person’s sex “has been changed by surgical procedure.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>District Court Judge Michael Moses wrote in the order that the law erects a discriminatory barrier for transgender people seeking to correct their birth certificates and deprives them of “significant control” over how they disclose their gender identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moses added that the law was unconstitutionally vague because it did not specify which surgical procedures were required for a transgender person to be able to alter their birth certificate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in May, DPHHS issued an emergency rule stating that Montanans still cannot alter the sex listed on their original birth certificates because sex is an “immutable genetic fact, which is not changeable, even by surgery.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Accordingly, this emergency rule does not authorize the amendment of the sex identified/cited on a birth certificate based on gender transition, gender identity, or change of gender,” the department wrote in May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Friday, DPHHS used the same reasoning to justify its adoption of a rule first proposed by the department in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Birth certificates and other records of birth include the ‘sex’ of the child, not the child's ‘gender’ or ‘gender identity,’” the department wrote in a notice that was signed by DPHHS Director Charles T. Brereton. “Science and medical knowledge recognize the difference between ‘sex,’ which is a biological concept (and a biological fact), and ‘gender,’ which is a psychological, cultural, and/or social construct.”In four states — Montana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia — individuals may not alter the gender marker or sex designation that is listed on their original state-issued birth certificate. Similar bans in Ohio and Idaho were struck down in 2020.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3638922-will-putins-energy-embargo-be-his-swan-song/",
        "description": "<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin made a fatal mistake when he started an energy embargo against Western European countries. It will cost him big. He will lose the war in Ukraine, set back Russia’s standing in the world long after he is gone, unite the West and improve the reputation of President Biden and the free world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once Putin’s failure becomes evident, he will turn his attention to the U.S. to exact revenge. The U.S. better be prepared for what may happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin likely thought that shutting off Russia’s gas flow to Western European countries would choke their economies, cause public unrest and force them to withdraw their support for Ukraine, thus giving him a better chance of winning the war. But so far the European Union continues to express steadfast support, despite the high economic and social costs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All Putin expressly wanted when he initiated his “special military operation” in February was for Ukraine to agree not to seek NATO membership, as well as to annex or “liberate” the Donbas region as he did Crimea in 2014, without forceful objections from the West. He likely did not realize that the embargo would instead unite the West and put him and his country on an irreversible losing streak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early days of the invasion, Putin won a large territory in the Donbas. As a result, Putin’s appetite grew, and his full plan surfaced. He wanted to capture the whole country and install a puppet government. Europe and the U.S., too, expected Ukraine to fall quickly, and Biden offered Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a safe heaven. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Few expected what happened next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Russian invasion galvanized the Ukrainian people, their army and president to fight ferociously against the Russian forces, thwart them and at times win battles. Favorable public opinion followed. Western Europe and the U.S. realized that helping Ukraine helps their democratic way of life and wards off the Russian threats to their own countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The invasion also motivated Sweden and Finland to join NATO — precisely what Putin did not want Ukraine to do. As a result, the West poured money, arms and humanitarian assistance into Ukraine. But Putin failed to realize this and refrain from starting his energy embargo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Putin is a wounded warrior who could act irrationally, as may be telegraphed by his occupation of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The West must handle Putin both firmly and delicately. On the one hand, it must treat Putin firmly, but not too firmly as to drive him to use nuclear weapons. On the other hand, it must treat him with consideration so he can declare his “special military mission” a success. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a response may require difficult compromises on the part of Ukraine, possibly giving some of the Donbas region to Russian influence. Surely, no one (not even Zelensky) expects the West to pay very high prices for energy, suffer economic contractions and finance the war for ever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with concessions, the net result of the embargo is a wounded Putin, a diminished Russian Federation, a more united Western European front with more resources allocated to energy independence and national defense and an enhanced standing of the U.S. as the leader of the free world, ready to handle threats to democracy in other places, including perhaps Taiwan.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the Ukrainian war subsides, Putin will intensify his attacks on the U.S. because he believes it is responsible for his losses. Since his military conventional forces are weak and ill-equipped, and the use of nuclear weapons is an unlikely option, he will invade with his cyber soldiers, using modern cyber technologies that Russia has been developing since Putin ascended to the presidency in 2000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. must be ready for Putin’s cyberattacks against the American political, economic and social systems, this time on a much bigger scale than in the past. Better yet, the U.S. should be prepared to strike Russia back hard and fast, for this seems to be the only language Putin understands. The U.S. must not lose this new cold war. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avraham Shama is the former dean of the College of Business at the University of Texas, The Pan-American.

        "description": "<p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) announced Monday that she will end the state's COVID-19 state of emergency amid falling case numbers and rising criticism. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the COVID-19 pandemic has faded as a major concern for much of the American public, there are still 10 states across the U.S. with emergency orders in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>States first declared public emergencies in March 2020 and governors kept renewing them until around the spring of 2022, when the pandemic eased after a brutal winter surge driven by the omicron variant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless renewed, nearly all of the emergency declarations in the remaining 10 states will expire by the beginning of 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the 10 states with orders still in effect, as of Sept. 12.</p>\n\n\n\nCalifornia\n\n\n\n<p>Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) extended the COVID-19 state of emergency in June. But he has also been \"responsibly winding down\" pandemic executive orders, leaving 5 percent of COVID-related provisions in place, according to a June 17 statement from Newsom's office. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As California navigates the evolving pandemic, the state remains laser-focused on keeping Californians safe while advancing our ongoing recovery,” Newsom said. “We’re continuing to deploy proven strategies and programs that allow us to swiftly and effectively respond to changing pandemic conditions, take on equity gaps, and keep us moving forward.”</p>\n\n\n\nConnecticut\n\n\n\n<p>The state has an emergency declaration in place for COVID-19 until Dec. 28, 2022, or until the federal government's public health emergency ends, whichever comes first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gov. Ned Lamont (D) said in a letter to the state legislature that it was beneficial for the state to keep the emergency, primarily to assist with food insecurity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the emergency, the federal government is authorized to distribute more assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</p>\n\n\n\nDelaware\n\n\n\n<p>Gov. John Carney (D) last renewed the public health emergency for COVID-19 on Aug. 19. It will expire on Sept. 18 unless renewed.</p>\n\n\n\nWashington\n\n\n\n<p>With the state experiencing declining COVID-19 death rates, Gov. Jay Inslee (D) announced he would end the public health emergency on Oct. 31.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’ve come a long way the past two years in developing the tools that allow us to adapt and live with COVID-19,” Inslee said in a statement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Ending this order does not mean we take it less seriously or will lose focus on how this virus has changed the way we live. We will continue our commitments to the public’s well-being, but simply through different tools that are now more appropriate for the era we’ve entered.”</p>\n\n\n\nNew Mexico\n\n\n\n<p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) extended the state's public health emergency for a month starting on Aug. 17. It will expire on Sept. 15 unless renewed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon renewing the order, she wrote: \"Due to the continued spread of COVID-19, it is necessary for all branches of State government to continue taking actions to minimize transmission of COVID-19 and reduce its attendant physical and economic harms.\"</p>\n\n\n\nTexas\n\n\n\n<p>Gov. Greg Abbott (R) last renewed the state's public health emergency in August and will have to decide whether to renew it again later this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abbott said the COVID-19 pandemic still presents an \"imminent threat of disaster for all counties in the State of Texas.\"</p>\n\n\n\nIllinois\n\n\n\n<p>Gov. JB Pritzker (D) extended the public health emergency in August and it will remain in effect until at least Sept. 17.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pritzker said more than 34,500 Illinoisans have died in the pandemic and added \"predicting what will happen in the future in this pandemic continues to be a difficult task.\"</p>\n\n\n\nKansas\n\n\n\n<p>The Kansas legislature passed a law this year extending emergency powers through January 2023, primarily to assist overburdened health care workers.</p>\n\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\n\n<p>Gov. Jim Justice (R) first declared a public health emergency in March 2020 and has yet to lift the order. He continues to give regular updates to the public about the state's pandemic response.</p>\n\n\n\nRhode Island\n\n\n\n<p>Gov. Daniel McKee extended the public health emergency earlier this month, citing \"the dangers to health and life posed by SARS-CoV-2.\" It will expire after Sept. 30 unless renewed.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Trivino has been excellent since coming over to the Yankees, and he stands to be a useful piece in the postseason.</p> <p>The bullpen has been a strength for the Yankees in 2022, but it has been due to surprising additions rather than known quantities. Lou Trivino came over to the team from the Oakland  A’s after underperforming with them, and has been a steady presence in the bullpen ever since. In 39 games and 32.0 innings with the A’s, he had a terrible 6.47 ERA with five home runs allowed in that limited time.</p>\n<p>However, since coming over, he has a minuscule 0.64 ERA in 16 games and 14.0 innings pitched. Of course, this still is a relatively small sample size, but it has lowered his ERA for 2022 to 4.70. This is much more respectable. What, then, is his role in the bullpen going forward as the Yankees head toward the postseason (hopefully)?</p>\n<p>Esteban wrote a little while back about some of the changes that Trivino has made since coming to Yankees. He concluded that increased usage of his slider and cutter have allowed him to not use his less well developed pitches.</p>\n<p>Since Esteban wrote about the changes in pitch usage, these trends seems to have continued. While Trivino has not totally shelved his sinker, he has reduced its usage below his cutter and slider. </p>\n  \n        \n      Credit: Baseball Savant\n      Lou Trivino 2022 Pitch Usage by Month\n  \n<p>There is good reason for him to use the cutter and slider as his main weapons for getting batters out. These two pitches have the lowest expected batting average and expected slugging percentage among his repertoire. </p>\n  \n        \n      Credit: Baseball Savant\n      Lou Trivino 2022 Pitch Tracking Stats\n  \n<p>Of the two pitches, the slider seems to be his best offering. The type of contact allowed with this pitch has resulted in an expected batting average of only .116 and an expected slugging percentage of just .199. His cutter has a slightly more pedestrian profile, but still good enough. This pitch has an expected batting average of just .236 and an expected slugging of just .311. </p>\n<p>In addition to the change in pitch usage, the Yankees have changed how they use Trivino as a reliever. In some ways, the Yankees have been using him as a righty specialist. Since coming to the team, he has pitched 10.0 innings against right handed batters while only 3.2 innings against left handed batters. </p>\n<p>Some of this comes down to the fact that left handed batters make up a minority of players, but when he was with Oakland, he still faced left handed batters a third of the time. Unfortunately, when he faced left handed batters with Oakland, he had an atrocious 9.58 ERA. While Trivino has not allowed an earned run against lefties with the Yankees, under four innings is a very limited sample size. </p>\n<p>Even when he was struggling with the A’s, he still managed to mostly get righties out with a much smaller 4.98 ERA compared to his total 6.47 ERA with Oakland. With these kind of splits, it makes sense to use Trivino to his advantages rather than to his disadvantages. The Yankees should keep limiting his exposure to left handed batters while using him to get out difficult righties. </p>\n<p>As the Yankees hopefully head toward the postseason, it’s important to consider how the team will configure its bullpen to maximize the chances of winning. Trivino offers the ability to use his cutter and slider to neutralize difficult right handed batters. He can help make up for someone like Lucas Luetge, who has a small weakness against righties, by coming in after (or before depending on sequencing) him. This is not like the halcyon days of a million different relief pitchers (read 2019), but creative use of the bullpen can limit exposure to difficult matchups. </p>\n<p>Combining the usage of Lucas Luetge and Lou Trivino should allow the Yankees to bridge the gap between their starters and their truly elite bullpen arms. Trivino is an imperfect pitcher, but the Yankees can make the most of him by limiting his exposure to left handed batters. If they do so, then they can make it more likely to limit the other teams. </p>\n<p>All cited statistics are as of the end of play on Saturday, September 10th.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A hormone secreted into the blood during endurance, or aerobic, exercise reduces levels of a protein linked to Parkinson’s disease and halts movement problems in mice, researchers report.</p>\n<p>Parkinson’s disease, a neurologic condition that causes people to lose control over their muscles and movements, affects about 1 million people in the US.</p>\n<p>If confirmed in additional laboratory research and clinical trials, the researchers’ study in mice engineered to have Parkinson’s disease symptoms could pave the way for a Parkinson’s disease therapy based on the hormone irisin.</p>\n<p>“If irisin’s utility pans out, we could envision it being developed into a gene or recombinant protein therapy.”</p>\n<p>Johns Hopkins Medicine’s Ted Dawson, and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute’s Bruce Spiegelman worked together to look into the link between the exercise molecule irisin and Parkinson’s disease.</p>\n<p>For unknown reasons, endurance exercise has long been found to alleviate symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Dawson, whose research focuses on neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, says one of the first clues to the link between exercise, Parkinson’s disease, and irisin came from Spiegelman, whose first paper about irisin was published in 2012 in Nature and subsequently in other scientific journals, showing that a protein called an irisin peptide is released into the blood and increases with endurance exercise.</p>\n<p>In the past decade, other laboratories have found that exercise elevates levels of irisin, and there is interest in looking into the connection between irisin and Alzheimer’s disease as well as Parkinson’s disease.</p>\n<p>To test the effects of irisin on Parkinson’s disease, Dawson and Spiegelman’s teams began with a research model used by Dawson in which mouse brain cells are engineered to spread small, spindly fibers of alpha synuclein, a protein that regulates moods and movements related to the brain neurotransmitter dopamine.</p>\n<p>When alpha synuclein proteins clump, those clusters kill dopamine-producing brain cells, a key trigger of Parkinson’s disease. Fibrous clumps of alpha synuclein are very similar, says Dawson, to what is found in the brains of people with Parkinson’s disease.</p>\n<p>In the laboratory model, the researchers found that irisin prevented the accumulation of alpha synuclein clumps and its associated brain cell death.</p>\n<p>Next, the research teams tested irisin’s effects on mice engineered to have Parkinson’s-like symptoms. They injected alpha synuclein into an area of the mouse brain, called the striatum, where dopamine-producing neurons extend. Two weeks later, the researchers injected a viral vector, which increased blood levels of irisin, which can cross the blood-brain barrier, into the mice.</p>\n<p>Six months later, mice that received irisin had no muscle movement deficits, while those injected with a placebo showed deficits in grip strength and their ability to descend a pole.</p>\n<p>The researchers demonstrated that irisin also speeds up the transport and degradation of alpha synuclein via fluid-filled sacs called lysosomes in brain cells.</p>\n<p>“If irisin’s utility pans out, we could envision it being developed into a gene or recombinant protein therapy,” says Dawson, referring to the widening field of drug development aimed at using cellular genetics to treat disease. Dawson is a professor in neurodegenerative diseases, a professor of neurology, and director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering.</p>\n<p>“Given that irisin is a naturally produced peptide hormone and seems to have evolved to cross the blood brain-barrier, we think it is worth continuing to evaluate irisin as a potential therapy for Parkinson’s and other forms of neurodegeneration” adds Spiegelman.</p>\n<p>Dawson and Spiegelman have filed for patents on the use of irisin in Parkinson’s disease. Spiegelman has created a biotechnology company, Aevum Therapeutics Inc., based in Boston, to develop irisin into treatments for neurodegenerative disease.</p>\n<p>Results of the researchers’ tests appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>\n<p>Additional scientists who contributed to the research are from Johns Hopkins and Harvard Medical School.</p>\n<p>Funding for the research came from the JPB Foundation, the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund, the Mark Foundation for Cancer Research, the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation, and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.</p>\n<p>Source: Johns Hopkins University </p>\n<p>The post Exercise hormone stops Parkinson’s symptoms in mice appeared first on Futurity.</p>",

        "description": "Avisaíl García had four hits an scored this run to help the White Sox equal a unique baseball record on this day, six years ago. | David Banks/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Adventures against Cleveland and Detroit</p> 1900\n<p>The White Sox beat the Cleveland Blues, 12-4, in Chicago to clinch the franchise’s first pennant. However, the American League would be recognized as an official Major League until 1901. Roy Patterson got the win in the game.</p>\n\n1908\n<p>Ultimately, the White Sox did not prevail for the pennant, but don’t say they didn’t put up a fight. Arriving at Detroit’s Bennett Park for a five-game set against the first-place Tigers and behind by three games, the White Sox won the opener, then played four consecutive extra-inning games to finish out the series, splitting them. On this day, the White Sox got back to just two games out with a 2-1 victory in 10 innings. Frank Smith not only went the distance for his 12th win on the season, he singled in the game-winner in the top of the 10th.</p>\n<p>The White Sox continued a three-way fight for the pennant (with Cleveland as well), and the season came down to the last day, hosting Detroit. Had the White Sox not been blown out in the finale, they would have finished tied with (but percentage points ahead of) Cleveland and a half-game in front of the Tigers for the pennant.</p>\n\n2016\n<p>The White Sox tied an unusual franchise record, as they beat Cleveland, 11-4, at U.S. Cellular Field. In the game, the Sox scored at least one run in every inning. It was only the 20th time in major league history that a team had accomplished this. The first time the White Sox did this was May 11, 1949, beating the Red Sox at Comiskey Park. </p>\n<p>In the 2016 win, the Sox banged out 16 hits, Avisaíl García getting four of them. Six went for extra bases. </p>\n\n2019\n<p>All-Star righthander Lucas Giolito set a White Sox record by striking out eight straight Royals hitters from the third through the fifth inning during an afternoon game at Guaranteed Rate Field. </p>\n<p>Of the eight, seven were swinging strikeouts, with Meibrys Viloria caught looking. The run started with Whit Merrifield to open the third, and ended with Nicky Lopez grounding out to shortstop Tim Anderson to end the fifth. Giolito finished with 12 strikeouts overall.  </p>\n<p>According to STATS, Giolito’s eight straight tied for the seventh-longest single-game MLB run at that time. But even with his brilliant afternoon, Giolito lost the game, 6-3, giving up a pair of home runs including a three-run shot that made the difference. </p>\n<p>Carlos Rodón (Sept. 30, 2016, against the Twins) and Joe Cowley (May 28, 1986, at the Rangers) previously shared the White Sox consecutive strikeout mark, at seven. </p>\n\n2020\n<p>White Sox first baseman José Abreu had himself a game to remember: The slugger drove home seven runs in a 14-0 slaughter of the Tigers at Guaranteed Rate Field. (The team record is eight in a game.) </p>\n<p>This was the second time Abreu had accomplished the mark, first driving in seven in a game in 2016. In the 2020 effort, he went 4-for-4 and scored five runs. Abreu became the first White Sox player in club history to get four-plus hits, two homers, seven RBIs and five runs in a game. It was also his 17th multi-homer game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Today in the New York Times, Pamela Paul introduces us to Bo Seo, a two-time world debate champion. He thinks we have a problem:</p>\n<p>“We disagree badly: Our arguments are painful and useless.” We spend more time vilifying, undermining and nullifying those we disagree with than opening or changing their minds. If more people took their cues from the world of competitive debate, he argues in a recent book, it would be easier to get people to reconsider their views or at least consider those of others.</p>\n<p>You may think I have no standing to disagree with this. Au contraire! It so happens that both my parents were university debate champions back in the day, and I'm quite sure that both of them would disagree with Bo Seo in the strongest possible terms.</p>\n<p>(What do you say about that, mom? Give me a call.)</p>\n<p>Formal debate is all about introducing facts—as many as possible—and then refuting them. In real life, this is not called debate, it's called the most boring thing in the entire world. It persuades no one. I've been doing it for 20 years and, as far as I can tell, have persuaded virtually no one of anything.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump, on the other hand, almost literally doesn't know any facts. Nor can he refute them in any rational way. But he is practically a cult leader.</p>\n<p>Sadly, people are not persuaded by facts. They are persuaded by emotions. They are persuaded only when they're listening to someone who shares their worldview. They are persuaded by \"arguments\" that are beneficial to them—perhaps monetarily, perhaps in conferring status, perhaps in vilifying people they already didn't like. This is how you win in real life.</p>\n<p>And don't make the mistake of thinking that you're the exception. Oh, you might be. The odds are a thousand to one against, but there are a few of you. The other 999, however, from PhDs down to ninth-grade dropouts, have no interest in dull facts and have no way of evaluating them anyway. They just want their biases confirmed and their status in the world elevated. Do that, and you too can win the presidency.</p>\n\nFacebook  \nTwitter \nEmail\nPrint",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/chromeos-vc-effects",
        "description": "<p>For a while there, ChromeOS users had no choice but to watch from afar as users of other desktop platforms enjoyed background blur and video effects on Zoom and other video conferencing apps. However, in 2020 – mostly due to the COVID-19 pandemic forcing a high demand for using video as a means to communicate with others – Google finally rolled out web-based background blur and video effects to Google Meet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As these were web-based, they didn’t necessarily need that much processing power and were therefore able to be used even in lower spec’d Chromebooks. Recently though, Google announced that background effects for Google Meet on the Web will now look more accurate thanks to background and foreground separation improvements. This will affect effects such as background blur, background replacement, and the recently launched immersive backgrounds and styles.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>These video effect improvements are meant to run on-device with an option to automatically switch to processing them on the cloud in order to optimize the effect’s quality. However, the cloud processing option is only available to a select few Google Workspace tiers, and will not reach personal Google accounts. This may be part of the reason why, according to to a new code change, Google is working on a flag to enable on-device background blur for video conferencing on Chromebooks (#vc-background-blur).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This commit was found by 9to5Google, which found yet another commit alluding to this feature being powered by machine learning, meaning that it will only be available on newer ChromeOS devices —namely the 11th Gen and 12th Gen Intel Chromebooks Google has been testing this feature on. There is also mention of two other background effects that will be enabled, such as “Portrait Relighting” – a feature of the Pixel Camera and Google Photos that adds a simulated directional light source – and “Auto-Framing,” which keeps you centered in the frame during the call.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is still early stages for this feature though, with the commit still marked as “Work in Progress,” and not merged yet to be tested in Canary. This means it might be a little while before we start to see this show up on Chromebooks, and the flag may only show up on the newer devices with specs that can handle that much processing power. Regardless, it’s great to see Google once again bringing features to Chromebooks that push the boundaries of what most people think Chromebooks are capable of. Can’t wait to try this.</p>\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

The “Virtual Keyboard Round Corners” flag gave her the slick, friendly-looking buttons and corners, as you can see above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtual Keyboard Round Corners</p><p>Enables round corners on the virtual keyboard. – ChromeOS</p>#enable-cros-virtual-keyboard-round-corners\n\n\n\n<p>Enable new header for virtual keyboard.</p><p>Enable new header for virtual keyboard to improve navigation. – ChromeOS</p>#enable-cros-virtual-keyboard-new-header\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, she discovered that by enabling the “Enable new header for virtual keyboard” flag, which can be found right above the aforementioned one, she received a brand new keyboard top bar which revealed options for emoji, handwriting and voice input, the keyboard itself as well as a paste functionality that were no longer packed away in a collapsible toggle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the right of that, the new keyboard header showed a global language picker that’s accessible with one tap, the floating keyboard toggle, and a quick swap keyboard language icon that saves you from having to enter into the language picker at all. Instead, it rapidly transforms your keyboard keys right before your eyes to a secondary language you’ve added to your OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below, you’ll see the design that the virtual keyboard used to have, and for many of you, the design it still utilizes. Because this update is available in Beta on ChromeOS, it shouldn’t be long before it hits the Stable, out-of-the-box experience (OOBE). Let me know in the comments if you use your Chromebook’s 4-in-1 features like tablet mode, or if you strictly type on the hardware keys.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/poverty/3639209-us-sees-unprecedented-decline-in-child-poverty-analysis/",
        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA newly published analysis by Child Trends found the U.S. child poverty rate has drastically improved over the past quarter century. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovements in unemployment, single mothers’ labor force participation and higher state minimum wages all contributed to the decrease in child poverty. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHispanic children experienced an increase in child poverty, attributed to discrimination in the labor market and restricted access to social safety net programs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. has made significant strides in reducing child poverty over the past quarter century, with a new analysis finding a multitude of economic factors have benefited families and lifted children across demographics out of poverty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Child Trends, a national children's advocacy group, published the results of an in-depth analysis of the history of child poverty in the U.S. It found improvements in unemployment rates, single mothers’ labor force participation and state-level minimum wage laws all contributed to a 59 percent decline in child poverty from 1993 to 2019. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past quarter century, the U.S. went through an “unprecedented decline in child poverty rates,” with researchers finding that magnitude of decline is unequaled in the history of poverty measurement in the U.S. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers found unemployment rates were much lower in 2019 than in 1993 and could explain as much as 18 percent of the total decline in child poverty. Single mothers’ labor force participation could explain about 9 percent, and higher state minimum wages could account for about 7 percent.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those factors also played a role in lifting median household incomes. In their analysis, researchers found real median household income increased by about 26 percent — from $54,600 in 1993 to $68,730 in 2019.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>America is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>That went hand in hand with minimum wage increases. While the real value of the federal minimum wage, which currently stands at $7.25, declined from 1993 to 2019, the average minimum wage increased by 23 percent thanks to state-level increases. Currently, 30 states and Washington, D.C., have set higher minimum wages than the federal amount along with other cities across the country. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came single mothers’ labor force participation, which notably jumped in the mid-to-late 1990s. Researchers found it increased by 17 percent from 1993 to 1999, at the same time the federal government expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit and reformed its welfare program.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, single mother labor force participation increased 15 percent from 1993 to 2019.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there were demographic disparities, with researchers finding that the share of children who are Hispanic or who live in immigrant families grew from 1993 to 2019. That shift was associated with increases in child poverty rates, with researchers explaining that’s likely, “reflective of Hispanic and immigrant parents who face discrimination in the labor market and restricted access to the social safety net, both of which limit efforts to reduce child poverty.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Black children experienced decreases in child poverty, but researchers noted the shift’s contribution to the overall national decline was small.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers noted that the U.S. has a well-documented history of persistent disparities in child poverty rates by race and ethnicity, which stems from systemic discrimination. That's created fertile ground for Hispanic and Black workers in particular to receive unequal pay, fewer benefits, lower job quality and disparate outcomes within employment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Without broad reforms to systemic discrimination and structural barriers that can trap immigrants in poverty, growing populations of immigrants can contribute to higher poverty rates,” wrote researchers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy has studied the Black-white child poverty gap and it found that from 2017 to 2019, before government benefits or tax credits were accounted for, 46 percent of Black children under the age of 18 were living in poverty. That made Black children’s poverty rate 2.7 times that of white children who had a poverty rate of 17 percent.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers from Child Trends hope their latest research will, “invigorate policy discourse on child poverty and renew a national commitment to reduce child poverty even more.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Census Bureau found that in 2020 the national poverty rate was 11.4, the first increase after five consecutive annual declines and the year the COVID-19 pandemic began.  </p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/3635745-give-haiti-another-chance-and-the-support-it-needs/",
        "description": "<p>In the midst of a clearly unfolding humanitarian disaster, many friends of Haiti are turning away from the impoverished nation, arguing that everything has been tried and little has worked. But turning our backs on Haiti now will only consign the country to misery, violence and hunger, with the ensuing outflow of emigrants. Based on wide experience in eight conflicts, to include Haiti, I believe there is a way out of the current dead end. It requires patiently and assertively combining international expertise and resources with Haitian will and energy to address the country’s intertwined problems of security and governance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haitians never have developed a means of collective decision-making, going from dictator to occupation and back again for more than 200 years. Meanwhile, its population has suffered nearly unprecedented demographic, economic and environmental pressures. The country’s latest tyrants are the gangs that compete violently over territory and resources, blocking the flow of even basic humanitarian aid. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It does little good to dwell on Haiti as a victim, however; history and geography have been unkind to many nations. As longtime Haiti observer Bob Shacochis put it, when given the chance Haitians will “rise stoically” to the challenges around them. And as analyst Georges Fauriol suggests, while the international community has been agonizing about what to do next, Haitians have been building the rudiments of a civil society that is prepared to take a central role in the country’s rebuilding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In every conflict I have observed or participated in, the center of gravity for the restoration of security and governability is what one of my mentors, the late fragility expert Rufus Phillips, called “a political cause worth sacrificing for, one that could earn the support of the people.”  International partners too often try to move quickly to an election or elite bargain without doing the hard work to develop a national consensus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To generate this, Haiti needs enough security, for long enough, to carry out a broad-based national dialogue. This dialogue should carry the country through an interim government, election and constitutional reforms. But re-establishing security and carrying out a political process must be conducted in tandem, as a single package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a breakthrough will require the international community to play a more active role. For all the frustration on both sides of the donor equation, the island nation has enjoyed periods of relative calm and an improving economy over the past 25 years, such as the second Preval administration before the 2010 earthquake. The international community at that time supported Haitian-led political decisions and solutions behind the scenes, while actively reinforcing its justice and security institutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that Haitians are beginning to coalesce around the concept of a national dialogue, with Prime Minister Ariel Henry’s government and the Montana Group, a coalition of civil society organizations and political parties, edging closer to acceptance. This is a process that has been followed in dozens of countries, and a formula can be developed for Haiti. But it will require international partners to establish strong incentives for compromise and the resources to conduct dialogues throughout Haitian society to broaden representation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gangs know they cannot control Haiti’s restive population forever. But having worked on the establishment of the first post-Duvalier police force and followed the issue for years, I believe the build-up of a credible police force, as important as this is, will never be robust enough to get ahead of the current void in security. One option would be an international stability force.  Another would require Haitian authorities to provide exit benefits and some immunity to gang leaders, which must be carefully negotiated to avert long-term damage to the country’s political future. This is something that has been done in other countries and there are international experts who could help design a process. The gang’s foot soldiers, on the other hand, want dignity and decent jobs. When the cost of gang membership grows high enough and other options appear attractive enough, they can be enticed to move on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The international community, working as a coalition, can provide Haiti with the diplomatic support needed to establish a national dialogue process while helping to ensure basic security. A team of high-profile mediators would demonstrate seriousness and help to stitch together the many threads of a successful plan. The United States has the added imperative of Haiti being one of the countries included in the congressional Global Fragility Act, which mandates a long-term framework for assistance based on inputs from local voices in working with fragile states such as Haiti. This could give Haitians the opportunity to develop the security and construct the political agreement needed to finally build the nation they deserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keith Mines has been involved in eight conflicts, to include Haiti, over a 35-year career as a special forces officer, diplomat and peacekeeper. He directs the Latin America program at the U.S. Institute of Peace and is the author of “Why Nation-Building Matters: Political Consolidation, Building Security Forces, and Economic Development in Failed and Fragile States.” </p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3639158-we-just-had-the-most-productive-congress-since-the-eisenhower-era-heres-what-that-means-for-the-country/",
        "description": "<p>After 36 years in Congress, all of it on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I can confidently say this is the most transformative session of Congress for our transportation system since President Eisenhower established the Interstate Highway System.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s review the tape.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last fall we passed the historic bipartisan infrastructure law. This transformational legislation provides $660 billion for transportation—the largest ever one-time infusion of federal funds into our nation’s transportation system. It will provide over $400 billion in funding for roads, bridges, and major multimodal projects. In my state of Oregon alone, that means over $3.7 billion to rebuild and modernize roads and bridges over the next five years. It provides the largest investment in public transportation in U.S. history, which will take cars off the road and improve the lives of those that rely on transit for their daily needs. It will strengthen our nation’s supply chains and boost local economies by investing $17 billion in ports. And it will do all this while creating good paying jobs that can’t be outsourced. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This historic investment couldn’t come at a more critical time. According to the American Society for Civil Engineers, America received a “C-” grade on its infrastructure report card, with most categories—bridges, levees, dams, drinking water, energy, roads, inland waterways, and wastewater—earning no higher than a “C+”. Over 40,000 American bridges are in poor condition and our public transit systems suffer from years of deferred maintenance.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, thanks to the infrastructure law, funding for more than 5,300 projects has already been allocated to tackle the backlog. The law provides $108 billion in funds to improve public transit. The law also establishes the first-ever federal highway programs dedicated to reducing carbon pollution, improving resilience, electric vehicle charging, and reconnecting communities divided by highways. It also creates several new grant programs for generational projects—such as replacing the aging I-5 bridge between Oregon and Washington with a safe, multimodal, and seismically resilient structure. These critical investments will make our transportation system more reliable and sustainable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The infrastructure law also makes essential investments in safety on our roadways. 2021 was the most dangerous year on America’s roads since 2005, and millions of families are torn apart each year by preventable traffic injuries and fatalities. It’s unacceptable that we lag far behind other wealthy nations in traffic safety. That’s why the infrastructure law made key policy changes and invests over $30 billion in dedicated roadway safety programs. One key new program will provide $5 billion across the nation for “Safe Streets and Roads for All,” to build complete streets that reduce crashes and fatalities for drivers, cyclists, pedestrians, and other vulnerable road users. This is critical, since fatalities among pedestrians and bicyclists have increased by 62 percent over the last decade. Making walking and biking safer and more accessible gives people an affordable, healthy, and sustainable option for short trips, all while taking cars off the road. That’s a win-win.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we didn’t stop there.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After some fits and starts, President Biden, all 50 Senate Democrats, and every single Democrat in the House of Representatives put people over politics and passed another extraordinary bill, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Not only will the IRA lower prescription drug costs, health care costs, and energy costs, it includes the most meaningful attempt in our country’s history to act on climate.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been telling anyone who will listen that the road to carbon reduction starts with the transportation sector—our single biggest contributor to U.S. emissions that cause climate change. The IRA does just that, offering a suite of tax credits and incentives to get American families and businesses to speed their transition from fossil fuels and towards renewables. Provisions from my committee will invest $2 billion in climate-friendly construction materials, $250 million to convert federal facilities into high-performance green buildings, and $244.5 million for sustainable aviation fuel projects.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits to families from the IRA are even more direct. Tax credits are making it easier for American families to switch to an electric vehicle and save money on gas right now—made possible by the groundwork laid by the infrastructure law’s $7.5 billion investment in the first-ever national network of EV chargers—while boosting American manufacturing and ensuring we can compete with China. We’re not only making greener cars more accessible, but homes as well. Solar panel installations and weatherization work that can lower energy bills is now eligible for assistance from the federal government.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Eisenhower kicked off an era of American dominance by connecting America with the Interstate Highway System.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Biden and the 117th Congress have now set the stage for American success by finally delivering us a greener, safer, and more reliable transportation system—which will serve our country for decades to come. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peter DeFazio is chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. </p>",

        "description": "Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Assessing Guardians starting pitchers using the average of many WAR calculations</p> \n<p>Pitchers, however, are valued very differently by the different systems. FIP is a linear weights based system that treats all balls in play as equally valuable and ignores sequencing. Baseball-Reference starts with runs allowed and works backwards. Baseball Prospectus uses a complex modeling system to attempt to derive the value of individual events while controlling for contextual factors. You have to decide which method is the one you prefer, although looking at each site is the best way to get a complete picture of the player.</p>\n<p>Piper Slowinski, March 22, 2012, FanGraphs dot com</p>\n\n<p>It continues to be excellent advice, in particular for pitchers. Going one step further, the addition of some simple and easily accessible statistics can help you infer why the various systems disagree with each other. </p>\n<p>It is truly up to you whether or not you want to understand starting pitchers with this level of detail. One lesson of this exercise each time I have run it is that the systems tend to agree. When they do not, the difference is not often drastic.</p>\n<p>When it is, someone is having an unusual season, and it is often Aaron Nola.</p>\n<p>Before we begin, here is how Baseball Prospectus explains its pitching value modeling: “Unlike other public pitching metrics, DRA- focuses on the pitcher’s expected contribution and uses a mixed-model approach to isolate the work of the pitcher from other factors like defense, park, and quality of opponent.” </p>\nShane Bieber - 27 GS\n<p>Traditional: 2.91 ERA, 173.1 IP, 25.9 K%, 5.1 BB%Batted Ball: 3.54 xERA, .290 BABIP, 0.78 HR/9</p>\n<p>4.4 fWAR, 3.3 bWAR, 3.4 WARP — 3.7 3WAR</p>\n<p>Nothing drastic to see here, folks. Bieber’s 2.91 ERA is quite a bit better than league average, which is right around 4.00 this season. We can also take a quick glance at his ERA and the expected ERA (xERA) to reveal that the Algorithms believe Bieber is a little bit lucky. </p>\nCal Quantrill - 27 GS\n<p>Traditional: 3.50 ERA, 157 IP, 16.6 K%, 6.6 BB%Batted Ball: 4.43 xERA, .277 BABIP, 1.03 HR/9</p>\n<p>1.7 fWAR, 1.6 bWAR, 0.6 WARP — 1.3 3WAR</p>\n<p>Boy does Baseball Prospectus not believe Quantrill deserves the outcomes he gets. It’s ... kind of funny? Normally when two of the models are neighbors the third is across the street.  Prospectus almost lives on the other side of the tracks, here. </p>\nZach Plesac - 23 GS\n<p>Traditional: 4.39 ERA, 127 IP, 18.1 K%, 6.8 BB%Batted Ball: 5.28 xERA, .285 BABIP, 1.35 HR/9</p>\n<p>0.8 fWAR, -0.4 bWAR, 0.4 WARP — 0.26 3WAR</p>\n<p>Plesac continues to struggle and the numbers bear it out. It is interesting to me that the fielding-independent model prefers Plesac, however mildly. </p>\nTriston McKenzie - 26 GS\n<p>Traditional: 3.05 ERA, 165.1 IP, 24.8 K%, 6.7 BB%Batted Ball: 3.85 xERA, .231 BABIP, 1.25 HR/9</p>\n<p>2.6 fWAR, 3.4 bWAR, 2.5 WARP —  2.83 3WAR</p>\n<p>It makes a certain amount of sense; FanGraphs’ model leans heavily on fielding-independent events. With a BABIP of .228, you can see where a “gap” might open in fWAR’s assessment. Baseball Reference leans on runs allowed per nine and is more interested in outcomes. I am unsure how, exactly, to interpret Baseball Prospectus’s take, but I suspect it does not believe McKenzie deserves his BABIP. I do. </p>\nAaron Civale - 16 GS\n<p>Traditional: 5.40 ERA, 75 IP, 23.1 K%, 6.2 BB%Batted Ball: 4.29 xERA, .321 BABIP, 1.2 HR/9</p>\n<p>1.0 fWAR, -0.9 bWAR, 0.7 WARP — 0.26 3WAR</p>\n<p>Now we see a bit more of a chasm emerge. While FanGraphs sees Civale’s 2022 to date as slightly above replacement level, Baseball Reference believes it is just plain bad. </p>\n<p>Prospectus bridges the gap but leans toward the fWAR side. It is similar to Plesac’s blend of WARs in that way though much more extreme here. When considering the difference in his ERA and xERA, in addition to the slightly elevated BABIP, it begins to become clear why the models are split so dramatically. Keep in mind, this is a two-win difference in about half the number of innings as his peers. </p>\n<p>Said another way, Aaron Civale owned very good strikeout and walk rates, a good home run rate, yet suffers from a tough ERA despite a great defense playing behind him. Some of this may be further explained by a slight dip in GB% which has been replaced by additional line drives. I’m not sure that many runs can get created, though. He might be a sneaky regression candidate. If healthy. When healthy? When healthy. </p>\nWe could review Konnor Pilkington — 9 GS\n<p>but I’m not sure WAR means much in fewer than 70 innings for a SP. It’s a bit of a stretch to use in-season WAR at all; single-season WAR is also used a little bit too definitively for my comfort.</p>\n<p>WAR also excludes intangibles. Wins lurk there, too. Not many, I suspect, but I’m actually glad there isn’t a metric or model designed to measure this. As far as I know, anyway. </p>\n<p>“Can’t sign him, Billy. This model says he’s an absolute jerk.”“So? He gets on — oh. Oh wow...”</p>\nWhat can we unpack from this?\n<p>Let’s look for some fun patterns. </p>\n<p>1. The walk rates of every Guardians starter are remarkably similar</p>\n<p>For reference, none other than Corey Kluber leads starters with at least 80 IP with a BB% of 3.1%. The worst in the league sits at 13.2%, and league average tends to be near 8%. I cannot find the value in order to be sure, but it feels like it’s closer to 7.5% or even 7.0% this year. I’m not so sure that this indicates hitters getting worse as pitchers continue to outpace hitters. In any case, Cleveland possesses five starters who limit free passes effectively.</p>\n<p>2. Every Guardians starter except Civale outperforms xERA by a significant margin</p>\n<p>Nearly a full season of Steven Kwan, Myles Straw, and Andrés Giménez seems to be paying dividends. I will not exclude Amed Rosario, who is playing shortstop well this season. All of those defensive runs saved above average represent very real outcomes that are borne out in pitcher ERAs. Even better, the Guardians already limit baserunners better than the average team, and so an unlikely gapper is even less likely lead to runs. Synergies are neat. </p>\n<p>3. All of this pretty much confirms what we already knew</p>\n<p>Shane Bieber and Triston McKenzie are pitching very well. Cal Quantrill is fine and gets killer run support, while Civale and Plesac aren’t pitching their best for various reasons. By taking the time to tease some of these resources and statistics apart, however, we can begin to see how they all relate. That can represent very real differences in how these players play the game, and keeping an eye on trends and patterns can occasionally yield some interesting information. </p>\n<p>For example, Aaron Civale’s overall stats might not indicate the true talent level at which he has been pitching. Anecdotally, this matches with his occasional lights-out performances this season. Sept. 15 vs. Detroit is a fine example.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless: he’s been disappointing this season at delivering results, on the whole, and we already knew that.</p>\n<p>Baseball.</p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "Do some people have built-in protection against a COVID infection?Laura Gao for NPR<p>Back in the early 1990s, Nathaniel Landau was a young virologist just starting his career in HIV research. But he and his colleagues were already on the verge of a landmark breakthrough. Several labs around the world were hot on his team's tail.</p><p>\"We were sleeping in the lab, just to keep the work going day and night because there were many labs all racing against each other,\" Landau says. \"Of course, we wanted to be the first to do it. We were totally stressed out. \"</p><p>Other scientists had identified groups of people who appeared to be completely resistant to HIV. \"People who knew they had been exposed to HIV multiple times, mainly through unprotected sex, yet they clearly were not infected,\" Landau explains.</p><p>And so the race was on to figure out why: \"Are these people just lucky or did they really have a mutation in their genes that was protecting them from infection?'\" he says.</p><p>Now 25 years later, scientists all over the world are trying to answer the same question but about a different virus: SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>By this point in the pandemic, most Americans have had at least one bout of COVID. For children under age 18, more than 80% of them have been infected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates.</p><p>But just as with HIV, some people have been exposed multiple times but never had symptoms and never tested positive.</p><p>\"We've heard countless anecdotes about nurses and health-care workers being exposed without any protection and remaining negative over and over again,\" says pediatrician Jean-Laurent Casanova, who studies the genetics of viral resistance at Rockefeller University. \"Or people share a household with someone who's been coughing for a couple of weeks, and one person stays negative.\"</p><p>So why haven't these people caught COVID?</p><p>After two years of hunting, a team at the University of California, San Francisco has come pretty close to answering the question.</p><p>\"These findings are like hot off the presses,\" says immunogeneticist Jill Hollenbach, who led this research. \"We haven't published them yet. It's all stuff that's been happening this summer.\"</p><p>Hollenbach and her team have found a genetic mutation that doesn't prevent the virus from infecting cells – that's what Landau was searching for in his HIV research – but still does something remarkable: It prevents a person from having COVID symptoms.</p><p>Turns out, stopping an infection altogether is an extremely tough nut for our bodies to crack.</p>What does it take to be a true superdodger?<p>Over the course of human history, scientists have identified only two instances of true virus superdodgers. That is, where a specific mutation in their genes makes people completely resistant to a virus. So that it slides off their cells, \"like water sliding off a glass window,\" as Casanova puts it..</p><p>In 2003, a team in London showed how some people never get a stomach bug, called norovirus, which causes vomiting and diarrhea. The researchers found that one mutation in their genes prevents them from making a molecule the virus needs to infect the cell.</p><p>(In 1995, researchers in France figured out why some people appeared to never be infected with a species of malaria known as Plasmodium vivax. However, over the past decade, further studies have clarified that these superdodgers actually do become infected with the parasite; they simply don't show symptoms.)</p>The best-known superdodgers in human history<p>By far, the most famous virus superdodgers are people protected against HIV — the ones Landau and his colleagues were studying back in the early 1990s.</p><p>In 1996, his team was getting really close to solving that puzzle. One morning they found a huge clue. The night before, they had set up an experiment to test which molecules HIV needed to infect a human cell. The experiment garnered spectacular results.</p><p>It showed that HIV didn't enter cells the way scientists had believed. Instead it needed a little bit of extra help. Specifically, HIV needs a specific molecule, called CCR5, on the surface of the cell to \"open the door\" and let the virus enter, Landau says. Without CCR5, the virus only sticks to the cell's surface but can't enter. \"It's kind of like the virus is knocking at the door, but nobody's opening the door. The door is locked,\" he says.</p><p>\"That was what we call a eureka moment,\" Landau says. \"That was the moment where we could say, 'We found something that had never been seen before.' \"</p><p>Landau and his colleagues rushed to the computer and wrote up the findings as quickly as possible. Then he literally ran to the FedEx store to submit the paper to the journal Nature, knowing that other teams were likely to have the same finding soon.</p><p>\"In those days you couldn't just submit your paper through your computer,\" he says. \"You had to mail a hard copy of it to the journal. And my job was to sprint over to the FedEx store so we could get the paper mailed on time.\"</p><p>Then only a few short weeks later, Landau and his colleagues made another huge discovery, and in the process solved the final piece of the HIV puzzle. \"We were quite amazed that it all happened so quickly,\" Landau says.</p><p>In collaboration with a research group down the hall, Landau and his colleagues sequenced the CCR5 gene in two people completely resistant to HIV. Lo and behold! Both people had the same mutation in the gene – and it's a powerful mutation. It completely cripples the molecule so that it doesn't appear on the cells' surface, the group reported in the journal Cell. Remember, without CCR5, HIV can't infect the cell.</p><p>\"You can put as many virus particles as you want onto those cells, and they will not get infected,\" he says. \"So in the case of resistance to HIV, the story was very clear.\"</p><p>The finding completely shifted the field of HIV. It led to the first – and only – way to cure a person of HIV and suggested a new route, using gene editing with CRISPR. But it did something else: It showed scientists that one mutation could make a person completely resistant to an infection. One mutation in their genes could make them a true superdodger.</p>Trying to find out if there really are COVID superdodgers<p>\"So when SARS-CoV-2 came along, of course, many labs looked to see if the same might be true for this virus,\" Landau says. And inspired by the story of CCR5, they went looking for mutations in the genes required for SARS-CoV-2 to enter and infect cells.</p><p>For COVID superdodgers, the situation appears to be more complex than for people resistant to HIV, Landau says, because the way SARS-CoV-2 infects cells is different from that of HIV.</p><p>Instead of using CCR5 to \"open the cell's door,\" SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor. People can't live without ACE2. \"The receptor regulates your blood pressure,\" Landau explains. So, unlike CCR5, you can't simply knock out the ACE2 receptor, he says. \"You're not going to have many people walking around that don't have ACE2.</p><p>\"Of course, there may be more subtle mutations in ACE2 which could play a role in resistance to SARS-CoV-2,\" he adds. \"But there doesn't seem to be an obvious and dramatic mutation as is the case for HIV.\"</p><p>But perhaps what's more likely, he says, is that people have mutations in genes other than ACE2, and these mutations probably don't protect them from getting infected per se but do protect them from getting sick.</p>Maybe there are ... mini-dodgers?<p>So having one of these mutations would make you a sort of COVID mini-dodger, if you will. There are other ways to resist an infection besides denying the virus entrance into the cell, Landau explains. And they likely involve your body's immune system.</p><p>That's exactly what the team at UCSF has found.</p><p>Since the pandemic begin, Jill Hollenbach and her colleagues at UCSF have been studying people who test positive COVID but show no symptoms. \"Not even a sniffle or a scratchy throat,\" she says. \"So they are entirely asymptomatic.\"</p><p>After analyzing DNA from more than 1,400 people, they identified a mutation that helps a person clear out a SARS-CoV-2 so fast that their body doesn't have a chance to develop symptoms.</p><p>The mutation occurs in a gene called HLA, which is critical during the earliest stages of infection. Hollenbach and her colleagues found that having a particular mutation in that gene increases a person's chance of being asymptomatic by almost 10 times. They reported those preliminary findings online last September.</p><p>Since then, they've gone on to show how this mutation works. And it has to do with your immune system preparing for SARS-CoV-2 before the pandemic even began back in 2019.</p><p>When a virus first enters cells, HLA signals to the immune system that cells are invaded and need help. That signal triggers a cascade of events that ultimately leads your body to make potent weapons specifically designed to fight SARS-CoV-2. These weapons include antibodies and T cells that uniquely recognize pieces of this virus. Once these targeted weapons are available, your immune system has a much easier time clearing up the infection. But these weapons take time to manufacture. And that delay allows the infection to spread and symptoms to develop.</p><p>But what if, for some lucky reason, your immune system already had weapons specifically targeted to SARS-CoV-2?</p><p>This summer, Hollenbach and her colleagues demonstrated that, with a specific mutation in HLA, some people have T cells that are already pre-programmed to recognize and fight off SARS-CoV-2. So there's no delay in generating COVID-specfic weaponry. It's already there.</p><p>\"Your immune response and these T cells fire up much more quickly [than in a person without the HLA mutation],\" Hollenbach says. \"So for lack of a better term, you basically nuke the infection before you even start to have symptoms.\"</p><p>But here's the kicker. For the HLA mutation to work (and for you to have these pre-armed T cells), you first had to have been infected with another coronavirus.</p><p>\"Most of us have been exposed to some common cold coronavirus at some point in life,\" she explains. And we all generate T cells to fight off these colds. But if you also have this mutation in your HLA, Hollenbach says, then just by mere luck, these T cells you make can also fight off SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>\"It's definitely luck,\" she says. \"But, you know, this mutation is quite common. We estimate that maybe 1 in 10 people have it. And in people who are asymptomatic, that rises to 1 in 5.\"</p>Seeking possible superdodgers who'll spit into a cup<p>While Hollenbach and her team continue to look for more mini-dodger genes, Casanova over at Rockefeller University and his colleagues are still trying to determine if there are true superdodger genes. And he's looking for participants right now for his study.</p><p>\"You fill out a questionnaire online about your exposures to SARS-CoV-2,\" he says. And then if you meet the criteria of a superdodger, the team sends you a testing kit. Basically you spit in a cup and mail it back to Casanova and his collaborators.</p><p>\"We'll extract your DNA and sequence your genome,\" he explains. \"We hope that in a group of 2,000 to 4,000 people, some people will have genetic mutations that tell us why they're resistant to infection.\"</p><p>\nAnd perhaps, like with HIV, that finding will one day shift the field of COVID research and lead to a vaccine that does what everyone wishes our current vaccines would do: turn everyone into a COVID superdodger.\n</p><p>Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>After a good series against KC, the competition gets a lot tougher as a new homestand begins.</p> <p>A series win over the fourth place Kansas City Royals over the weekend allowed the Tigers to creep within two and a half games of the Royals in the AL Central. Things get a lot more difficult as they come home for series against the AL leading Houston Astros and then the Chicago White Sox this weekend. </p>\n<p>Nothing that happens now will ease the pain of a brutal season for the Tigers, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t some positive developments underway. Over the last 30 days, the Tigers’ offense, still on track as one of the worst in baseball this season, has actually been a middle of the pack unit, producing a 101 wRC+. With Riley Greene finding his way, the addition of some young blood has helped the offense stave off the second half blahs afflicting many teams this late in the season. </p>\n<p>Kerry Carpenter has provided some punch, with a 147 wRC+ in 21 games in the big leagues. Ryan Kreidler has only played eight games, but has made an impact with a game winning home run and some strong defensive work. Even Javier Báez, whose numbers are unrecoverable after a disastrous month of May, has been better after adopting an old separated hands drill he got from Manny Ramirez. The shortstop has a 136 wRC+ in September, lending some hope that he can work his way through his struggles and recapture his power next season.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, one Spencer Torkelson has been absolutely raking since his return to the Tigers’ lineup. It’s only eight games, but suddenly Torkelson looks like Torkelson. He has a 196 wRC+ with a home run, a triple, two doubles, and three walks in just 32 plate appearances since his return. Let’s say rumors of his early demise were perhaps overstated. </p>\n<p>Is any of this enough to help them take down the American League’s powerhouse? Perhaps not, but it lends credence to the idea that the club’s 2023 fortunes have a lot more positive potential than it felt like a month ago.</p>\nDetroit Tigers (54-86) vs. Houston Astros (90-50)\n<p>Time/Place: 6:40 p.m., Comerica ParkSB Nation Site: Crawfish BoxesMedia:  Bally Sports Detroit, MLB.TV, Tigers Radio NetworkPitching Matchup: LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (3-4, 4.13 ERA) vs. LHP Framber Valdez (14-5, 2.64 ERA)</p>\n<p>Since his return, Eduardo Rodriguez has been competent, but not particularly good. He and Chris Fetter have done a little work tweaking the movement on his cutter, and he’s put together a couple of good starts showing a little more bite on the pitch. Fundamentally, he’s still a pitcher looking to pound the edges with his fastball and use his changeup for whiffs and weak contact. He’ll be sorely tested by one of the best lineups in the game tonight.</p>\n<p>All year long, while struggling desperately to hit right-handed pitching, the Tigers have actually done a solid job against lefties. Framber Valdez isn’t your average southpaw, however. The command artist gets his fair share of strikeouts, but thrives by getting a steady diet of routine ground balls off his sinker hit right into the proper defensive alignments, and rarely ever surrenders a home run. Valdez’s out pitch is a tilting 79-80 mph curveball that is rarely hit hard, and he’ll mix in a fair number of changeups to keep right-handed hitters off balance.</p>\n<p>The Tigers are probably going to have a hard time doing damage against Valdez, and Rodriguez is going to have a tough time keeping the Astros’ offense in check. With patient at-bats, the Tigers can put up a bit of offense, but they’re really going to need a strong effort from their own southpaw starter to keep this one close, and hopefully win it in the late innings.</p>\n\n\n<p>MondayNightFun playing baseball pic.twitter.com/YLqiGfJ5bU</p>— Detroit Tigers (@tigers) September 12, 2022",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/giants-interested-in-free-agent-shortstops-this-offseason.html",
        "description": "<p>The Giants could be one of the most aggressive teams this offseason, given their limited payroll commitments and many areas of need. The club’s president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi recently spoke about how “everything is on the table” this winter, “including going out and being aggressive at the top end of the free agent market.” Bob Nightengale of USA Today reports that they would “love” to go after one of the top shortstop free agents if they don’t sign Aaron Judge.</p>\n<p>Judge will undoubtedly be the top free agent on the market, based on his career track record and incredible platform season. He’s already hit 55 home runs on the year and has produced an overall batting line of .307/.410/.679. That amounts to an unbelievable 202 wRC+, indicating Judge has somehow been 102% better than the league average hitter. When combined with solid outfield defense and 16 stolen bases, he’s already racked up 9.3 wins above replacement on the season in the estimation of FanGraphs and 8.7 at Baseball Reference.</p>\n<p>Given that Judge grew up in the Bay Area, he’s often been speculatively connected to the Giants, though it would take a sizeable commitment on the team’s part for that to come to fruition. Back in April, Judge and the Yankees failed to reach an agreement on an extension, with the slugger reportedly turning down a seven-year, $213.5MM deal. Judge was apparently looking for $36MM over nine or ten years, a range of $324-360MM. Now that Judge is having his best season yet and will soon be able to court offers from the 29 other teams, it’s entirely possible that he will now try to do even better than that.</p>\n<p>The Giants haven’t operated at anywhere near that level since Zaidi took over in November of 2018, having not yet given out a contract longer than three years in his tenure. However, that means that the team’s ledger is fairly clear, giving the club the opportunity to change course. There’s only about $89MM committed for next year’s team, in the estimation of Jason Martinez of Roster Resource. That doesn’t include raises for arbitration-eligible players like Mike Yastrzemski or Logan Webb, but it does include $22.5MM for Carlos Rodon, who is almost certainly going to opt out and return to free agency. They have just over $20MM committed to 2024 and nothing for 2025 and beyond. Given that they had an Opening Day payroll of $155MM this year, per Cot’s Baseball Contracts, and have been as high as $200MM in 2018, there’s room for a big splash if they want to make it.</p>\n<p>If the club can’t successfully bring Judge back to the neighborhood, it seems that pursuing a shortstop will be another option they will consider. Of course, the club already has a shortstop in Brandon Crawford, who has been a mainstay there for over a decade, having made his debut in 2011. Last year was a revelation for Crawford, as he suddenly produced the best campaign of his career after a few rough seasons. He hit .298/.373/.522 in 2021, producing a 138 wRC+ that was 25 points better than his previous career high. When combined with his excellent defensive work, he produced 6.3 wins above replacement, in the estimation of FanGraphs, easily eclipsing his previous high of 4.4.</p>\n<p>In the midst of that excellent showing, the Giants and Crawford agreed to a two-year, $32MM extension, though the first season has been a disappointment. Crawford has been battling a knee injury for most of the year, going on the IL twice because of it. When healthy enough to take the field, he hasn’t been able to produce at anywhere near his 2021 output. He’s hitting .226/.305/.346 on the season for a wRC+ of 85, with his defensive numbers also not as impressive as last year.</p>\n<p>Crawford still has one year remaining on that extension but will be turning 36 in January. Given his age, knee issues and diminished performance, it seems the Giants are willing to consider a bold move to strengthen their infield. Since the field of available shortstops is going to be strong again this year, it might be prudent to strike early, even if it means Crawford and another shortstop sharing the roster for one season. Trea Turner and Dansby Swanson are both on the cusp of free agency, with Carlos Correa and Xander Bogaerts both expected to opt out of their respective contracts and join them.</p>\n<p>The Giants have also been significantly held back by their defense this year, with a collective -30 Outs Above Average and -33 Defensive Runs Saved, both of those numbers placing them 28th in the majors. Ultimate Zone Rating gives them a -28.6, which is 29th. Second base has been a particularly rough area, with the team’s collective numbers at the keystone coming in at -5 OAA (25th), -15 DRS (29th) and -2.1 UZR (21st). Having a shortstop-quality defender take over at second base, either Crawford or an outside addition, might be a good way for the club to take a step forward next year, especially with the ban on extreme defensive shifts going into place next season.</p>\n<p>Thairo Estrada and Wilmer Flores have taken the bulk of playing time at second base this season, though each is capable of playing other positions and arguably better utilized away from second. Estrada has a -10 DRS at second and Flores a -6 this year, with each of them putting up better numbers at the other positions they’ve played. Estrada has yet to reach arbitration and Flores is eschewing free agency after agreeing to a two-year extension, reported earlier today.</p>\n<p>Each of the Turner/Swanson/Correa/Bogaerts group will likely command a lesser contract than Judge, though that doesn’t mean they will be cheap. All four of them are currently younger than 30 years old, with Xander crossing that threshold on October 1. That means each of them will likely be looking for lengthy contracts. This past offseason, Corey Seager got ten years, Marcus Semien got seven, with Trevor Story and Javier Baez each getting six. Correa ended up settling for a three-year deal, though with a high average annual value of $35.1MM and opt-outs after each season. Similar to any Judge contract, the Giants would likely have to break their pattern of sticking to short-term deals in order to make an impact in the shortstop market. Should they miss out on all of the upper tier options, there’s a significant drop to the next level, which will be occupied by players like Jose Iglesias and Elvis Andrus.</p>\n<p>All told, it should be a fascinating winter for the Giants and their fans. The club has been keeping its books mostly clear for years and has stayed busy on the waiver wire, grabbing just about any role player they could find. That’s left the roster in a position where they have solid depth all around the roster but a lack of truly outstanding players. 10 different position players have produced at least 0.5 fWAR for the Giants on the season but none higher than 2.3 so far. Perhaps the conditions are right for them to raise the ceiling in the months to come.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Last month, Acer released one of the first-ever Chromebooks powered by AMD’s latest Ryzen 5000-series processor. The 14-inch Acer Chromebook Spin 514 offers up the familiar premium chassis we’ve come to know and love from the Spin family and early benchmarks put the Ryzen 3 somewhere in the vicinity of a 10th Gen Intel Core i5. While that power may be overshadowed by Intel’s newer CPUs equipped with Iris Xe graphics, the Ryzen 5000 series features significant gains over the last iteration of the made-for Chromebook AMD APUs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some would argue that AMD is still too far behind in the game for Acer to demand a $549 price tag for the Spin 514. I can certainly see both sides of the coin but still, Acer builds great Chromebooks and anything under $600 with this kind of power isn’t exactly a ripoff. Yes, you can wait it out and find a deal on a newer 12th Gen Chromebook that will get you somewhere in the realm of $600 but I don’t feel that detracts from the Spin 514 and what it has to offer. Speaking of that, here’s a look at what you get from the $549 model that’s currently available at Best Buy.</p>\n\n\n\nAcer Chromebook Spin 514 AMD specs\n\n\n\nChrome OS14″ IPS display, Touch panel, Full HD 1920 x 1080AMD Ryzen 3 5125C Accelerated Processing Unit (APU)8GB of DDR4 system memoryAMD Radeon Vega Mobile Graphics128 GB eMMC2 – USB Type-C ports supporting USB 3.2 Gen 1 (up to 5 Gbps)Display port over USB-CUSB 3.2 Type-A port3.5 mm headphone/speaker jack, supporting headsets with a built-in microphoneDimensions: 322.6 (W) x 225.5 (D) x 17.35/17.35 (H) mm (12.7 x 8.88 x 0.68/0.68 inches)Weight: 1.55 kg (3.42 lbs.)Battery Life: Up to 10 hoursWireless: Wi-Fi 5 2×2 MIMO Bluetooth 5Audio: Two built-in stereo speakers; Two built-in microphonesDurability: U.S. MIL-STD 810 (Sand and Dust testing based on MIL-STD 810F.)\n\n\n\n<p>The value of this Chromebook may be subjective at its original MSRP however, that changes when you knock over $100 off of the price. That’s exactly what Best Buy has done and right now, you can pick up this feature-rich 2-in-1 Chromebook for the low price of only $429. That scores you a 14-inch, FullHD convertible with an aluminum lid and base for a very reasonable price. You’re getting plenty of power, Wi-Fi 6, an FHD webcam, and plenty of storage for what some “budget” models cost and that’s nothing to sneeze at.

        "description": "D. Ross Cameron-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>As a blogger, there are times when I fall into a rut about what to write about next. For as good as these Astros are, that consistent level of success doesn’t necessarily produce intriguing storylines every single day of the season. Occasionally, a promising idea evaporates as I come across another piece of information disproving my original notion. This is frustrating when you’re already in a rut. Much like the actual baseball season, it is a grind at times. </p>\n<p>Plus, this team is so good at winning that it leads to more instances such as this than one would first believe. There are only a finite number of instances where one can write about the lack of direction in center field, player payroll, or Yordan Alvarez’s hands before it becomes a tired topic. To be clear, I am not complaining about the club’s performance in recent seasons, but, again, it is a grind. </p>\n<p>For every idea I post, I probably have about two-to-three items of interest in my notes that I haven’t had time to research properly or run into some dead end. Some are likely more of an offseason project, to be honest. That said, there are still nuggets of information worth passing along. So, in essence, this is more of a note-dumping post, but one I hope that you, the reader, can glean some insight from. </p>\n<p>Note #1: Banning the Shift</p>\n<p>If you follow baseball closely enough, you’ve probably heard about the rule changes coming to Major League Baseball next season. A pitch clock, for one, to help speed up the game. Another is larger bases. Perhaps the most controversial of the three rule changes is the “banning” of the shift as we know it today. Regardless if it is good for the game or not, it could prove detrimental for the Astros, who have the third-highest shift total in baseball at 50.1 percent. </p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>By Outs Above Average (OAA), only one club (Diamondbacks, plus-32) has posted a higher value than the Astros at plus-24. While all of those outs are not necessarily a byproduct of the infield shift, there is some potential to lose value here when the ban takes effect next season. The question for next year is what degree? </p>\n<p>Note #2: Will Smith’s Resurgence? </p>\n<p>I may write more about Will Smith in the next week or two once there are additional results to digest, but I’d figure it is worth pointing out today that the left-hander reliever has looked serviceable for the Astros in his 14 2⁄3 innings of work (2.45 ERA/3.46 FIP). In particular, Smith has only walked three opposing hitters since his trade to Houston; in 37 innings with the Braves this season, he unintentionally walked 21 opposing hitters. That is enough of a change, even in a short sample, to explore further, especially if that trend holds in his next few appearances. Do I trust him in high-leverage situations? No. Has he pitched himself into the postseason roster discussion? Probably. </p>\n<p>Note #3: It Needs More Four-Seam Fastball(s)</p>\n<p>Consider this more of a sneak preview of an article that I’ve been meaning to write for the past two months: The resurgent four-seam fastball. As you may have already noticed, the Astros throw the most four-seam fastballs in the AL at 42.6 percent. Only the Dodgers at 44.1 percent have a higher rate in the majors. </p>\n<p>Considering how the league-average rate for four-seam fastballs is roughly 33 percent and the rate of increase for both Houston and Los Angeles, I wonder if they are zigging while everyone is zagging. After all, the league average four-seam rate has fallen by slightly over two percent from last season. Considering the reputation of these two clubs and their respective front offices, there is something there worth exploring further. </p>",

On Monday, Freeman was rewarded by being named National League player of the week.</p>\n<p>Freeman had 12 hits in 22 at-bats last week, hitting .545/.593/1.045 with three home runs and two doubles, driving in eight runs and scoring seven times. He had four hits on Saturday, Freeman’s fifth four-hit game of the season. The three home runs last week matched Freeman’s total for his previous 43 games, during which he was still productive, hitting .325 with 12 doubles.</p>\n<p>“What he prides himself on taking good at-bats, whatever the situation dictates, whether it’s driving in a run, whether it’s taking a walk, seeing pitches,” manager Dave Roberts told reporters in San Diego on Saturday, as shown on SportsNet LA. “The back of the baseball card doesn’t lie. He’s going to hit homers, but he’s not a home run hitter. He prides himself on being a good hitter. The slug is going to come in bunches.”</p>\n<p>On the season, Freeman is hitting .331/.403/.527, leading the majors in batting average, hits (180), and doubles (45), the latter just four shy of tying the Los Angeles Dodgers record for two-baggers in a season. Freeman has started all 139 games this season, one of three major leaguers to play every game so far in 2022, along with Freeman’s former teammate Dansby Swanson in Atlanta and Matt Olson, Freeman’s replacement at first base for the Braves.</p>\n<p>This is the third NL player of the week honor this season for Freeman, who also won for June 20-26 and July 11-17. Freeman is the second Dodger to win three NL player of the week awards in a season, for an award that began in 1973. Mike Piazza also won three weekly honors during his stellar rookie season in 1993.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers have won five NL player of the week honors this season. In addition to Freeman, Cody Bellinger won for the week of April 18-24, and Mookie Betts captured the award for August 22-28.</p>",

        "description": "The best hitter of his generation has gone all Superman in his final season and it’s frankly the best storyline of the year. (Photo by Justin Berl/Getty Images)<p>I’ve gotta be honest with you guys: When the Angels DFA’d Albert Pujols last summer and the Dodgers picked him up, I sent more than a few tweets wondering if Andrew Friedman had lost his mind. </p><p>Pujols was 41 and his legs didn’t work. His OPS+ sat at an abysmal 66—or, 126 points lower than when he won the NL MVP award in 2008. But, the Dodgers’ bench was extremely thin after they let Joc Pederson and Enrique Hernandez walk in free agency, and Pujols could be had on the pro-rated major league minimum of $429,000 while the Angels paid the rest of his $30 million dollar salary. I was proven wrong almost immediately, as Pujols not only hit much better for the Dodgers than he did for the Angels (because of course he did), but he also proved invaluable to a team in desperate need of a Spanish-speaking leader.</p><p>With a 99 OPS+ for the Dodgers in 85 games, he was just a league-average player on paper. But when I asked Clayton Kershaw what Pujols brought to the team, Kershaw surprised me by gushing about how immeasurable his role has been in team-building because he was the only native Spanish-speaking veteran on the Dodgers. In my own obsession with X’s and O’s as well as my own blind spot as a native English speaker, it was a vital human element I completely missed.</p><p>Because Pujols is bilingual and deeply respected in the Dodgers’ clubhouse, he was able to easily bring the young Hispanic players more into the fold and make them feel included in the club’s every-day social activities. He was also able to serve as a hitting mentor to players of all stripes and experience, which made him more valuable to the Dodgers than any statistic I could find about him on Baseball Reference or FanGraphs.</p><p>But the thing that struck me most about Pujols was that as soon as he got out of Anaheim, he seemed to move through the world like the weight of a struggling franchise had been finally lifted off his aging back, and he was free to just have fun. </p><p>He quickly earned the nickname of Tīo Albert in the Dodger locker room, and looking back I think that moniker was more significant than just a show of respect and affection. I know this because I am an aunt to a three-year-old. I see her roughly once a week and I get to play with her and take her to ice cream or dance class and McDonald’s and teach her all the lyrics to every Harry Styles song (except “Watermelon Sugar,” which I’ve been told is off-limits). Then I get to go home. My sister and brother-in-law have to deal with the responsibility of actually raising my niece: the boundary setting, the sleepless nights, the constant “no’s.” They’re doing a tremendous job, but it’s a lot of work. I merely swoop in to have fun once a week for a few hours then I wave goodbye and let them deal with bed time.</p><p>This is a reader supported newsletter. Both free and paid versions are available. The best way to support me and my work is by taking out a paid subscription now:</p><p>Subscribe now</p><p>I say this because when the Angels gave Pujols that 10-year contract for $240 million, he became their dad. If the team stunk—which they did for the majority of the decade he spent there—fair or not it, was largely his fault. He did not play with a smile on his face. His breathing did not appear light. He looked stressed and upset and at times overwhelmed, like a dad with three unruly children under the age of five. You won’t find me crying for anyone who gets paid nine figures to play a children’s game. But Pujols? Well, he didn’t look like he was having any fun at all. And maybe that’s one of the reasons why he never played particularly well in Anaheim.</p><p>In his last season in St. Louis in 2011 he posted a career worst OPS+ of 138—which was still good enough for him to finish fifth in MVP voting. His OPS+ dipped a bit to 128+ in his first year with the Angels in 2012, then it fell off a cliff. </p><p>(I’m using OPS+ here instead of OPS because it adjusts for park factors and Pujols switched leagues from the NL to the AL so it feels like the most appropriate metric to gauge his success).</p><p>We don’t need to relive his nightmarish years in Anaheim, except to say that in his age 42 season as a St. Louis Cardinal, he is hitting better than he did in any season during his ages 31-41 seasons in Anaheim. Since Aug. 4, Pujols is hitting .326/.385/.756 with 11 home runs. </p><p>\"There's impressive, and then there's unbelievable,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol told reporters on Sunday. \"And what we're witnessing right now is absolutely legendary.\"</p><p>Marmol was talking about how moments earlier, Pujols his the 697th home run of his career for pass Alex Rodriguez for 4th all-time on MLB’s home run list. More importantly for the playoff bound Cardinals, Pujols’ home run also proved to be the game-winner.</p><p>And then this happened:</p>Jeff Jones @jmjonesMatt and Samantha Brown caught Pujols’s 697th homer. Samantha’s\nfather passed away one year ago today. They met with Albert to give him the ball back — he told them to keep it and signed two more for them. Said it would mean more to her than to him. <p>September 11th 2022</p>2,126 Retweets15,524 Likes<p>Can you even imagine? I get the sense that Pujols was comfortable parting with that baseball because he knows how in his bones that he’s going to hit #700 this season, maybe even as soon as this week. It’s gotten to the point now where my favorite baseball game is whenever Pujols is up to bat. I’m trying to find a Twitter alert that will just let me know when that’s happening. (Or will any of you diehard Cardinal fans text me if I give you my number? I’m serious! I’m living for this!).</p><p>As it stands right now, Pujols trails Babe freaking Ruth by just 17 home runs. He’s insistent that this is his final season, no matter what, but….am I selfish for wanting him to pull a Tom Brady and un-retire 40 days after this season ends so he can keep this magical run going? </p><p>Pujols told reporters back in March that this was his last season.</p><p>He re-iterated to Bob Nightingale of USA Today a few weeks ago that despite his success this season, he has not changed his mind:</p><p>“I’m still going to retire, no matter whether I end up hitting 693, 696, 700, whatever,’’ Pujols told USA TODAY Sports. “I don’t get caught up in numbers. If you were going to tell me 22 years ago that I would be this close, I would have told you that you’re freakin’ crazy. My career has been amazing.’’</p><p>So, nothing will change your mind?</p><p>“If I can’t hit 70 homers, I’m not coming back,’’ Pujols said, laughing. “No, I’ve had enough. I’m glad I made the announcement this was it when I signed. Really, I wouldn’t change a thing.’’</p><p>So how is Pujols doing all this during the eleventh hour of his career? Nobody knows for sure, but I have a few guesses. Besides the joy he’s playing with now that he’s not carrying the weight of an entire franchise on his shoulders, it’s possible that like Buster Posey before him, he is simply emptying the tank, like a marathon runner making a mad dash for the finish line once they hit mile 26. </p><p>Posey put up his best numbers in seven years in what turned out to be his swan song, though he kept his decision to retire a secret from the public until the year was finished. There’s another key different between Posey and Pujols that makes what Pujols is doing even more remarkable: Pujols didn’t even have a job until late in spring training. It was never a given that he would get a chance to play this year, let alone mash 18 homers in his 22nd season. Pujols was already a first-ballot Hall of Famer, but he now only needs three more home runs to reach the 700 club—a feat that seemed impossible when the Angels cut him last summer when he had 667.</p><p>I don’t want this to be his last season. But if it is, I will remember that the greatest hitter I ever saw went out like the legend he is. Maybe that’s how he wants to be remembered, as a man who walked away from a sport that would still gladly have him. For the other ninety-nine percent of players not named Posey or Pujols, the sport itself decides when it’s over.</p><p>Things are stressful right now. Our pandemic still isn’t over. The political climate in the United States hasn’t been this bad since the civil war. Our planet is melting. </p><p>But Tío Albert is hitting home runs for us. And that’s the beauty in this world that I’m choosing to focus on this week.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A rocket crashed back to Earth shortly after liftoff Monday in the first launch accident for Jeff Bezos’ space travel company, but the capsule carrying experiments managed to parachute to safety.</p><p>No one was aboard the Blue Origin flight, which used the same kind of rocket as the one that sends paying customers to the edge of space. The rockets are now grounded pending the outcome of an investigation, the Federal Aviation Administration said.</p><p>The New Shepard rocket was barely a minute into its flight from West Texas when bright yellow flames shot out from around the single engine at the bottom. The capsule’s emergency launch abort system immediately kicked in, lifting the craft off the top. Several minutes later, the capsule parachuted onto the remote desert floor.</p><p>The rocket came crashing down, with no injuries or damage reported, said the FAA, which is in charge of public safety during commercial space launches and landings.</p><p>Blue Origin's launch commentary went silent when the capsule catapulted off the rocket Monday morning, eventually announcing: “It appears we've experienced an anomaly with today's flight. This wasn't planned.\"</p><p>“Booster failure on today’s uncrewed flight. Escape system performed as designed,” the Kent, Washington-based company tweeted close to an hour later.</p><p>The company later said the rocket crashed.</p><p>The mishap occurred as the rocket was traveling nearly 700 mph at an altitude of about 28,000 feet. There was no video shown of the rocket — only the capsule — after the failure. It happened around the point the rocket is under the maximum amount of pressure, called max-q.</p><p>The rocket usually lands upright on the desert floor and then is recycled for future flights.</p><p>The webcast showed the capsule reaching a maximum altitude of more than 37,000 feet. Thirty-six experiments were on board to be exposed to a few minutes of weightlessness. Half were sponsored by NASA, mostly from students.</p><p>It was the 23rd flight for the New Shepard program, named after the first American in space, Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard. It was the ninth flight for this particular rocket-capsule pair, which was dedicated to flying experiments.</p><p>Blue Origin's most recent flight with paying customers was just last month; the ticket price hasn’t been released. Bezos was on the first New Shepard crew last year. Altogether, Blue Origin has carried 31 people on 10-minute flights, including actor William Shatner.</p><p>The rocket should have launched nearly two weeks ago, but was grounded until Monday by bad weather.</p>",

        "description": "By Jeffrey Yelverton with YourClassical<p>Jorja Fleezanis, Minnesota Orchestra’s longest-serving concertmaster and the second woman to serve as concertmaster in a major U.S. orchestra at the time of her appointment in 1989, has died in her home in northern Michigan at 70.</p><p>Fleezanis, a violinist, was devoted to music. A graduate of the Cleveland Insitute of Music and Cincinnati Conservatory, Fleezanis performed with the Chicago Symphony and the San Francisco Symphony as associate concertmaster before joining the Minnesota Orchestra.</p><p>Edo de Waart was the conductor of the Minnesota Orchestra when Fleezanis joined in 1989. At the news of her passing, Waart stated, “Jorja Fleezanis was a force of nature. She and I first met in an audition at the San Francisco Symphony, where she played Sibelius. I was immediately inspired by the way she played. It was marvelous and so I offered her the position. When I became music director of the Minnesota Orchestra, I invited her to serve as concertmaster.</p><p>“Jorja put more into her music than anyone I ever worked with,” he said. “She had a tremendous instinct for how things should be played. In my experience, that is a rare talent—as was her ability to be absolutely charming and frank at the same time. She called things exactly as she saw them. Jorja was a great friend, and her passing is a tremendous loss to me and the world of classical music.”</p><p>Minnesota Orchestra conductor laureate Osmo Vänskä, who Fleezanis spent her final years at the orchestra performing with, said, “Jorja was a wonderful musician, and she had so much passion and love for music. She was always open-minded when speaking about life, food and wine, new ideas and, of course, music. I look back on my years working with her with great fondness and appreciation.”</p>Minneosta Orchestra concertmaster Jorja Fleezanis, right, with conductor Osmo Vanska in 2009.Photo: Greg Helgeson<p>During her tenure at the Minnesota Orchestra, Fleezanis had two pieces commissioned for her by the orchestra. The first was the John Adams Violin Concerto, which she debuted in 1994 with Edo de Waart conducting, and the second was Ikon of Eros, composed by John Tavener. Recorded in the Cathedral of St. Paul for the centennial of the Minnesota Orchestra in 2003, the work is a magnificent expression of conflicting forces. The Divine Spirit, voiced by the orchestra, and the Divine Eros, played by Fleezanis on violin, represent a transcendence that unites us all. Here is the third movement from that performance.</p><p>Following her departure from the Minnesota Orchestra in 2009, she joined the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music faculty.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3639067-queen-elizabeth-iis-stoic-legacy/",
        "description": "<p>Queen Elizabeth II passed away on Thursday at age 96, and with her went perhaps the most enduring representation of female leadership that the world has ever known.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The heartfelt reaction to her death among the British citizens who gathered at Buckingham Palace and broke into a spontaneous chorus of “God Save the King,” as King Charles III now takes the throne, was a moment of poignance and earnestness on a public stage that no longer permits much of either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United Kingdom is likely to have kings on the throne for many years hence, as the new monarch’s eldest son, William, and his eldest grandson, George, are expected to succeed him. Around the world, however, the number of women who assume positions of leadership and responsibility in politics, medicine and business is likely to continue to grow in the post-Elizabethan era, just as they did throughout her reign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the late queen’s model of leadership – stoic, steady and strong – is in danger of dying along with her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would be tragic, for it is the only model of leadership that can, as Queen Elizabeth did for so many years, modernize old (and thus inevitably compromised, as everything human is compromised) institutions without desecrating and destroying them. Moreover, it is the model that is most effective for many female leaders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the 25-year-old Elizabeth being crowned in 1952, there were no tips for managing the insecurity that is now termed “imposter syndrome” and would become a de rigueur way for young women to process the experience of stepping into a demanding academic or professional role some 70 years later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There would be no trendy cocktail of mental and physical maladies for the young queen to tally in an effort to underscore her worth even as they rendered her ostensibly incapable of performing daily functions. And there would be no assumption, on the part of anyone attending or advising the late queen, that a female leader’s lack of control over her own emotions could possibly betray anything other than exactly what the same lack of control would betray in a male leader: weakness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a less forgiving time to be a woman in power. In an important way, though, it was also a more respectful, less patronizing one. No one assumed that Elizabeth would be any less capable of rising to the task, coping with its demands and maintaining her composure under utmost pressure than her father had been. She met these expectations, not by pretending to be a man (the late queen was quite fashionably feminine, in fact) but by embodying a stoic leadership persona that simply presumed her equality as a woman to be a given. And thus, it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a culture that now fetishizes female victimization and emotionalism and relabels them empowerment (for example, in Disney’s recent “Turning Red” (2020), in which a pubescent girl’s emotions are so intense and uncontrollable that they balloon into a red panda, which she chooses to keep rather than restrain like the older women in her family do, signifying that she’s proud to be out of control), young women are infantilized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This renders them (and, increasingly, their male counterparts as well) mentally and emotionally coddled, and thereby unprepared for the stresses that accompany increased responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The queen ascended to the throne long before she was ready, and long before she hoped to. Greatness was, as Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night” has it, “thrust upon [her].” She rose to the occasion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Greatness is also being thrust upon each of us (in more mundane ways, of course) if we care to answer the call. Can we rise to the occasion? Can we resuscitate the presumptive deference to hard work, loyalty and duty – above sentiment, virility and trivia – that Queen Elizabeth embodied, in a society where those virtues have suffered more than a surface wound over the past several years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know, but it’s worth a try. God save us all if we don’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elizabeth Grace Matthew writes about culture, politics and religion for various publications, including America magazine and The Philadelphia Inquirer.

        "description": "<p>The Biden administration on Monday proposed to strengthen certain safety regulations for offshore oil and gas drilling that were loosened under the Trump administration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill that killed 11 workers and released 134 million gallons of fuel into the Gulf of Mexico, the Obama administration implemented new safety regulations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, the Trump administration revised those standards, making them more industry-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, the Interior Department indicated that it would further tweak the rules, although the new proposal does not appear to be identical to what was put forth during the Obama years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interior Secretary Deb Haaland told reporters on Monday that she believes that the changes will \"improve conditions for offshore workers and the public.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She criticized the Trump administration's rollback of the Obama-era rule, saying that it was done to \"tip the balance of oversight of offshore activities back to the oil and gas industry.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the changes is the reinstatement of a requirement to send information on safety equipment failures to the federal government instead of to certain third parties that were permitted to collect data during the Trump years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the new rule, inspections of such failures will also need to start sooner. Under the Trump administration, inspections needed to begin 120 days after a failure; they would now need to start in 90. Under the Obama rule, inspections had to be finished within 120 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Biden administration estimates that the changes will cost between $2.2 million and $2.4 million over a 10-year period. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move comes after the Environmental Protection Agency similarly reinstated safety standards for chemical plants that were also loosened under Trump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also comes after the Biden administration released an offshore drilling plan that could enable as many as 11 new opportunities to drill for oil and gas offshore. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under that plan, it’s not clear whether the department will move ahead with that many leasee sales, saying it could also pursue fewer or no lease sales in the coming years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This story was updated at 4:16 p.m.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/mental-health/3639224-what-is-lifestyle-fatigue-and-do-you-suffer-from-it/",
        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Although not an official diagnosis, “lifestyle fatigue” represents a feeling of being stuck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also related to feelings of physical tiredness and emotional exhaustion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA psychotherapist offers some questions to think through and says that adding new changes to your routine can help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Although many people may be returning to the rhythms of pre-pandemic work and personal life, some may be experiencing mental health issues, as well as physical and emotional exhaustion. These feelings may be hard to articulate, but psychiatrists are hearing from patients that they are tired or stuck. One psychiatrist has named this feeling “lifestyle fatigue.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, someone experiencing “lifestyle fatigue” may be “feeling stuck in a rut,” writes psychotherapist Sean Grover in Psychology Today. Lifestyle fatigue is a term Grover uses and is not an official diagnosis. It can be triggered, for example by life events or external factors, but is more a sign of being stuck rather than for depression. If you think you are experiencing depression, please seek the help of a mental health professional. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for people who are self-reflecting on their mental health, framing in terms of lifestyle fatigue could be a helpful way to think through their issues. Grover lists some questions, such as: </p>\n\n\n\nDoes every day feel the same? Is your work dull and unrewarding? Do you dread leaving your house? Do you spend more time with screens than people? Have you lost your creative drive? Do you tend to ruminate or obsess about your failures?Do activities that used to give you pleasure now feel like a waste of time? \n\n\n\n<p>Another aspect of lifestyle fatigue is the emotional toll that everything in peoples’ personal lives, their environment and in the news, has on mental health. Emotional exhaustion may vary by person, but in general, “you’re lacking the energy to do things, lacking the motivation [and] finding that there are things that you feel you should do [but] don’t have the desire to anymore,” says Elaina DellaCava, who is a psychiatrist at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, to HuffPost. Normal, everyday activities can be hard for someone experiencing emotional exhaustion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, old activities may not be giving the same effect as they used to and that might mean you should look for new activities. “Over time, what I’ve seen in my practice is that people are reporting they try to make themselves do things but just the enjoyment isn’t there in the same way it used to be,” says DellaCava. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One solution to lifestyle fatigue, according to Grover, is adding some change. “Any change in your daily routine, such as waking up earlier, going to bed earlier, contacting an old friend, or going to a concert or the theater, will do. Look for new activities that disrupt monotony or predictability,” writes Grover. “It doesn't matter how big or small. Change is a powerful antidote.” </p>",

        "description": "<p>Senate Democrats’ campaign arm released a new ad on Monday attacking Arizona Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters’s comments about Social Security during a primary debate in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee’s (DSCC) ad, titled “Privatize,” claims Masters would privatize Social Security, a position he floated during the primary before backing away from the idea last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Blake Masters wants to cut taxes for billionaires,” the ad begins. “And to pay for it? He said he’d cut our Social Security and privatize it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The spot goes on to play a clip from a June 23 debate during the primary contest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Right? Maybe we should privatize Social Security?” Masters says in the clip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ad later accuses the GOP candidate of wanting to \"gamble it all on the stock market.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Masters distanced himself from the comments last month, telling The Arizona Republic in an interview that he “probably” wanted to increase payments and desired to encourage younger Americans to invest, possibly by raising limits on Roth IRAs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I do not want to privatize Social Security,” he told the newspaper. “I think, in context, I was talking about something very different. We can’t change the system. We can’t pull the rug out from seniors. I will never, ever support cutting Social Security.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hill has reached out to the Masters campaign for comment.The DSCC said in a statement that the ad campaign is part of the group’s $33 million ad reservation this fall, which includes $7.5 million allocated for the Arizona race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), late last month canceled reservations for ads in Arizona that were set to air between Sept. 6 and Oct. 3, reportedly worth about $8 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saving Arizona PAC, a pro-Masters group initially funded by venture capitalist Peter Thiel during the primary campaign, on Friday launched its first television campaign for Masters since he became the nominee. Politico reported that the group now is operating without Thiel’s funding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Masters, who was backed by former President Trump in his primary, is hoping to unseat incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), who faces a tough reelection battle in one of the most closely watched midterm Senate races this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans are largely seen as favored to flip control of the House, but Democrats are hoping to hold on to their razor-thin majority in the Senate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonpartisan election analyst FiveThirtyEight’s forecast as of Monday suggests Republicans have a 74 percent chance of flipping the House but a 31 percent chance of flipping the Senate. The forecast indicates Kelly has a 74 percent chance of retaining his seat.</p>",

        "description": "<p>More than 150 Michigan Republicans launched a new campaign effort to boost the reelection prospects of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) against GOP opponent Tudor Dixon, who is backed by former President Trump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans for Whitmer is led by a leadership council of 35 Republicans from Michigan, including business leaders, former lawmakers and staff who served under former state GOP governors John Engler and Rick Snyder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bill Parfet, the chairman and CEO of commercial real estate company Northwood Group, said he was supporting Whitmer because she was seeking to build a common bridge between Democrats and Republicans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"No more fighting,\" Parfet said in a statement. \"“Among those running for election in November, there exists a group of individuals — some Democrats, some Republicans — that are willing to work together to find a common middle-ground where progress can be made. ... The best person to lead that effort is Governor Gretchen Whitmer.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whitmer, who has served as Michigan's governor since 2019, appears to be gaining ground in her re-election bid against Dixon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a Detroit News/WDIV-TV poll published last week, Whitmer enjoyed a 13-point lead over Dixon, while 54 percent of respondents said they approve of Whitmer's governorship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dixon is a former customer service agent and sales rep for her father's Michigan Steel foundry who also describes herself as a \"working mom\" now fighting for Michiganders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GOP candidate has faced some criticism for her hardline anti-abortion positions, a hot-button issue in the midterms this year that is increasingly giving momentum to Democrats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July, Dixon said she would not support abortion in any case except to save the life of the mother, even when asked if that would apply to a 14-year-old rape victim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judy Frey, a moderate Republican from Grand Rapids who joined the Republicans for Whitmer group, said she backs the governor because of her support for a ballot question that will be included in the November election. The question will allow voters to decide if they want to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whitmer \"knows how to govern. She's done it, she's experienced, she uses compromise, she uses empathy,\" Frey said in a promotional video for the new group. \"She gets my vote this year.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Republicans for Whitmer effort marks something of a shift in Michigan politics, which recently saw a foiled far-right attempt to kidnap the governor for her pandemic policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state is also divided between Republican control of the state legislature and Whitmer's Democratic executive branch, which have feuded over abortion laws after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the nearly 50-year constitutional right to abortion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Joe Schwarz, a former Republican U.S. congressman from Michigan, said \"Whitmer has proven herself as a strong leader who is fighting to make Michigan a better place for everyone — regardless of your party affiliation.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"During her time as governor, she has focused on growing our economy with major investments, strengthening our skilled workforce, investing in the education of our children, and making government work for us,\" Schwarz said in a statement. \"I know she will continue to advocate on behalf of hardworking Michiganders and that's why I'm proud to support her for re-election this fall.\"</p>",

        "description": "<p>Enlarge (credit: Aurich Lawson | Getty Images)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, US President Joe Biden will announce more information on his plan to end cancer. The president will use the 60th anniversary of President Kennedy's legendary speech about putting a man on the Moon to name a director for a new agency to make this happen, adding yet one more acronym to the US biomedical research enterprise. The new agency is intended to improve the \"government’s ability to speed biomedical and health research,\" and will be led by Dr. Renee Wegrzyn.</p>\n<p>And as was the case in 2016, it still appears to suggest that the federal government is wasting money on the National Cancer Institute, which despite receiving almost $7 billion a year, apparently needs an entirely new agency—the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health—to actually cure cancer. What is especially troubling is that those concerns were evident in 2016 when then-Vice President Biden first proposed the idea, which we've dusted off below:</p>\n<p>Original article, January 14, 2016: During this week's State of the Union address, President Obama announced that his vice president, Joe Biden, will lead a new science \"moonshot\" to put an end to cancer. According to an article on Medium posted by the vice president, this will do two things: increase resources devoted to fighting cancer and break down barriers that prevent sharing of information among cancer researchers.</p><p>Read 18 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Reds made some roster moves today, with Mark Sheldon of MLB.com relaying them on Twitter. Right-hander Justin Dunn, who was sick yesterday, has been placed on the injured list without a designation, implying he is on the COVID-related injured list. Right-hander Raynel Espinal has been called up from Triple-A to take his place on the roster. Additionally, outfielder Albert Almora Jr., who was designated for assignment last week, has been released.</p>\n<p>Espinal, 30, has MLB experience, though his résumé is quite short. He made one appearance for the Red Sox last year, throwing two innings, his only appearance in the big leagues so far. As he was a COVID substitute player, he was removed from Boston’s roster without being exposed to waivers, reaching free agency at season’s end. He signed a minor league deal with the Giants but went to the Cubs in the Dixon Machado trade. Espinal was released a couple of weeks later, landing with the Reds on a minors deal.</p>\n<p>Between the three organizations, he’s thrown 102 1/3 Triple-A innings on the year over 25 appearances, 21 starts. He has a 5.63 ERA in that time, though with a strong 27.2% strikeout rate. It’s possible that he might be designated a COVID substitute again, just like with Boston last year. If that is indeed the case, he would be able to be removed from the roster without being exposed to waivers.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Twitter is facing a tough Tuesday as senators gear up to hear testimony from a whistleblower alleging widespread security deficiencies at the social media company — the same day Twitter shareholders vote on whether to approve Elon Musk’s embattled $44 billion deal to buy the company. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Senate Judiciary hearing featuring whistleblower Peiter “Mudge” Zatko and shareholder vote come after Musk has leveraged Zatko’s allegations in his legal attempt to back out of the agreement to buy Twitter, and as lawmakers have ramped up scrutiny of Twitter and other social media companies’ ability to protect users ahead of the upcoming midterms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are five things to watch ahead of the hearing. </p>\n\n\n\nWill Democrats and GOP form a united front\n\n\n\n<p>Tech scrutiny has emerged as a rare unifying issue in Congress, with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle attacking dominant tech platforms like Twitter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the issues raised by Zatko in his 84-page complaint — sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Department of Justice and lawmakers — get to the heart of concerns Democrats and Republicans have pressed social media companies on, according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post in August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When announcing the hearing in August, Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and ranking member Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) issued a joint statement stating the allegations of  “widespread security failures and foreign state actor interference at Twitter raise serious concerns.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If these claims are accurate, they may show dangerous data privacy and security risks for Twitter users around the world,” Durbin and Grassley said.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, senators on the panel could split down party lines over more contentious topics at the hearing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During past tech hearings, like with Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen last year, or with tech executives including former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in 2020, Republicans accused the platforms of censoring conservative speech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Democrats have broadly pushed for tech companies, including Twitter, to take a greater stand against hate speech and misinformation, and may question Zatko about Twitter’s policies and ability to moderate such content. </p>\n\n\n\nQuestions on foreign interference \n\n\n\n<p>At the center of Zatko’s allegations of widespread security deficiencies is an accusation that Twitter is not complying with a 2011 FTC consent order. The agency ordered Twitter to create and maintain a security program designed to protect privacy and nonpublic consumer information as part of a settlement over an FTC complaint that hackers were able to gain control of Twitter on two occasions in 2009. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up until the time of Zatko’s termination, he alleges Twitter “remained out of compliance in multiple respects” with the 2011 order.  The “deficiencies” led Twitter to suffer from an “anomalously high rate of security incidents,” he alleged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout 2021, Zatko says he became aware of “multiple episodes suggesting that Twitter had been penetrated by foreign intelligence agencies and/or was complicit in threats to democratic governance,” according to the complaint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the complaint alleges the Indian government forced Twitter to hire specific individuals who were government agents who would have access to “vast amounts of Twitter sensitive data” because of “Twitter’s basic architectural flaws.” Zatko alleges that Twitter executives violated the company’s commitment to its users by “knowingly permitting an Indian government agent direct unsupervised access” to Twitter data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zatko also alleges that Twitter executives “risked endangering” users in China, who are using circumvention technologies to access Twitter despite China’s ban, by accepting money from Chinese entities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter has pushed back strongly on Zatko’s allegations, calling it a “false narrative” that is “riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context.” </p>\n\n\n\nNational security scrutiny \n\n\n\n<p>Zatko’s wide-ranging accusations also raise concerns about national security, which will likely be a focus for senators on the panel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of his complaint focuses on questions he asked during the Jan. 6 attack at the Capitol last year. Zatko alleges he asked an executive in charge of engineering how to “seal the production environment” from potential internal protests aligning with the rioters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zatko said he was told it was “impossible to protect the production environment” and that all engineers had access without a log of who accessed it or what they did. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already Zatko’s complaint has led Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) to urge regulatory agencies to investigate Zatko’s allegations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Senate more broadly is focusing this week on the risk social media platforms have on national security, as well. A day after Zatko testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is holding a two-part hearing with current and former social media executives to examine the concerns. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Executives from Twitter, YouTube, Meta and TikTok will testify before the Senate panel Wednesday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am convening this hearing to provide a rare opportunity for the public to hear directly from the architects of these platforms on how they balance their pursuit of increased user engagement and revenue with the risk of funneling people towards violent and dangerous content that threatens the safety of our communities,” Senate Homeland Security Chair Gary Peters (D-Mich.) said in a statement. </p>\n\n\n\nThe shareholder vote \n\n\n\n<p>Twitter shareholders will vote on the embattled deal for Musk to buy the company for $44 billion at a special meeting tomorrow that will likely coincide with the Senate hearing. The hearing is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m., and the shareholder vote is scheduled for 1 p.m. EST. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter’s board of directors unanimously recommended that shareholders vote to approve the adoption of the merger agreement, and analysts say shareholders are expected to overwhelmingly approve the deal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the outcome of the vote, the deal will still be stuck in limbo as Twitter and Musk await an Oct. 17 trial in Delaware Chancery Court over the company suing to force Musk to follow through on his deal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The shareholder approval expected tomorrow formally sets the stage for the Game of Thrones Battle between Musk and Twitter in the Delaware Courts with the high possibility in our opinion that some form of negotiation likely takes place ahead of this date,” Wedbush analysts Dan Ives and John Katsingris said in a note Monday. </p>\n\n\n\nHow Elon Musk factors in \n\n\n\n<p>Musk is trying to back out of the agreement he reached earlier this year with Twitter to buy the company for $44 billion. He argues that Twitter was not forthcoming in its assessment of the number of spam bots on the platform, and therefore the deal should be voided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of Zatko’s complaint appears to bolster Musk’s accusations. Zatko even accuses Twitter of “lying” to Musk about bots on the platform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musk’s lawyers are leaning heavily into Zatko’s argument and issued a subpoena for Zatko as part of the case. And last week, a judge ruled that Musk will be able to introduce allegations from Zatko in the case, but denied Musk’s request to delay the trial. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musk filed twice with the SEC since Zatko’s accusations were published trying to back out of the deal based on the allegations he raised. Both times, Twitter has responded saying his argument is invalid, most recently in a regulatory filing Monday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As was the case with each of your prior purported terminations, the Musk Parties third purported termination is invalid for the independent reason that Mr. Musk and the other Musk Parties continue to knowingly, intentionally, willfully, and materially breach the Agreement,” Twitter attorneys wrote in the Monday filing.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Green Bay Packers star quarterback Aaron Rodgers slammed California's COVID-19 restrictions in a podcast released Sunday, saying the state is “going to shit.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an episode of “Club Random with Bill Maher” released on Sunday, Rodgers lamented the changes in his home state, where he still reportedly owns a home. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“State’s going to shit, but I’m hanging on,” Rodgers told Maher, complaining that the strict social distancing rules and mask mandates affected business in his hometown of Chico. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I grew up in a small town, very little cases up in Chico, Calif., but all the small businesses? F---ing gone,\" the 38-year-old quarterback said. “I mean our favorite restaurants in LA,  in New York, and across the country, not just in big cities, but some crazy percentage will never open again.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rodgers also called out California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) over proposed legislation AB-2098, which would designate medical officials who spread misinformation about COVID-19 as committing \"unprofessional conduct.\" The legislation was passed by the state’s Senate last month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I don't believe the government should have any control over what we do with our bodies,\" he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rodgers, a four-time NFL MVP,  garnered headlines last season for his refusal to get vaccinated, and misleading comments before the season that he was \"immunized.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former University of California standout is among a handful of top athletes, along with Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving and Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic, who have been outspoken about their  skepticism about COVID-19 vaccines and mandates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During an appearance on a “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast episode last month, the quarterback thanked Rogan, another vaccine skeptic, for advising him on how to deal with COVID-19 when he tested positive in the middle of the season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rodgers also told Rogan he calculated his now infamous “immunized” response because he didn’t want to dodge the question outright, which would have conveyed his unvaccinated status.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I thought there’s a possibility that I say, ‘I’m immunized,’ maybe they understand what that means, maybe they don’t. Maybe they follow up. They didn’t follow up,” Rodgers told Rogan. “So then I go [into] the season, them thinking, some of them, that I was vaccinated.”</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Atlanta’s rookie sensation (on the mound) is back in the Bay Area and taking on the National League representative in this neck of the woods. </p> <p>Following a tough series loss in Seattle, the Braves are looking to end their West Coast road trip on a high note by getting off to a good start in their upcoming series against the San Francisco Giants. </p>\n<p>The good news is that today is a day where Spencer Strider is scheduled to pitch. Lately, that’s translated to a lot of good days as Strider has been pitching lights out as of recent times. Dating back to August 15, Strider has only given up two runs or less in each of his five starts in that span. He’s also made it through five innings in each of those starts as well. Assuming Strider has another good night, it would be safe to expect him to make it into the sixth inning and hopefully doing so with a bunch of strikeouts and very few walks and runs conceded. </p>\n<p>Spencer Strider may also be going into this game with a bit of a point to prove against this team in particular. Back when the Giants visited Cobb County in June, San Francisco got Strider for six runs over only 3.2 innings pitched. You could argue that that was part of rookie growing pains for Strider as that was only his fifth start of the season and hopefully that ends up being the case. Also, the Giants as a team have struck out 23.6 percent of the time. They’ll be dealing with a pitcher who has been striking out batters at a rate of 38.1 percent. This could be a prime opportunity for Spencer Strider to have another good night on the mound. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Alex Cobb is San Francisco’s starter for tonight’s contest. The Braves didn’t see Cobb in any of the four games that took place at, well, Cobb County earlier this summer and this will actually be the firs time Cobb has taken on Atlanta since 2018. I’m not going to bring that game up because it has relevance to tonight’s game — instead, I’m bringing it up because this is one of the most chaotic win probability charts that you will ever see. If you’re a combination of a Braves/Falcons fan, look away since I know win probability charts are a very horrifying specter when it comes to both of these fanbases in the past 24 hours. </p>\n  \n        \n      FanGraphs.com\n      What (and I can’t stress this enough) in the world?\n  \n<p>The clear hope for tonight’s game is that we don’t see anything near the chaos that we saw both yesterday evening and on this particular day in 2018. Alex Cobb himself has been doing perfectly fine in San Francisco’s rotation this season and he hasn’t really had any nightmarish scenarios in recent times. If the Braves can get three runs off of him tonight, then they’re going to be doing fine. Of course it would be great to see the Braves run him from the game early on but we have to be realistic, right?</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, a good ol’ beatdown would be a nice palate cleanser after the Braves left Seattle with a sour taste in their mouths. It would also be great to go out there and pick up a win since the current divisional leaders haven’t exactly proven themselves to be invulnerable to the weak competition on their schedule. You never know when an opportunity will present itself to snatch a game back, so the Braves should be trying  to take every opportunity they can to gain a game. While the Giants aren’t exactly a cellar dweller, these are the types of games that the Braves should win if they want to have a strong chance of snatching the East division away by the time the season is over. </p>\nGame Info\n<p>Game Date/Time: Monday, September 12, 9:45 p.m. ET</p>\n<p>Location: Oracle Park, San Francisco, California</p>\n<p>Streaming: Bally Sports South, MLB Network (out-of-market only)</p>\n<p>Radio: 680 AM / 93.7 FM The Fan</p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>A solid result at home has given the Yankees new wind beneath their sails.</p> <p>Last we checked in, we were counting down the days to doomsday with the Yankees’ division lead. Those worries have been somewhat abated after beating the Rays at home following a three-for-one trade with the Twins, but the pressure is still on to not let the lead slip away in these final weeks. Add on top of that a constant watch party for Aaron Judge’s historic home run count and toss in a side of a Triple Crown possibility, and there’s a lot at stake.</p>\n<p>So much is still up in the air, and there’s not a lot of time left to figure it all out. How impactful will the team’s injured list returnees be down the stretch? When can we expect to see Judge’s next batch of homers, and how legit is his chance at the Triple Crown? Can Gerrit Cole quietly break the franchise record for strikeouts? If you’ve got questions like these, or any other concerns, be sure to send them in for a chance to be featured in our Yankees mailbag.</p>\n<p>Answers will run on Friday morning. All questions received by the night of September 15th will be considered. You can leave your submissions in the comment section below or by e-mail to pinstripealleyblog [at] gmail [dot] com.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is an edition of Up for Debate, a newsletter by Conor Friedersdorf. On Wednesdays, he rounds up timely conversations and solicits reader responses to one thought-provoking question. Later, he publishes some thoughtful replies. Sign up for the newsletter here.</p><p>Last week, a person who came of age in the online era tweeted this question: “Literally BAFFLED as to how people found love before dating sites and social media. Was settling the norm? Or did everyone just happen to be romantically compatible with the person sitting nearest to them in class?” I asked readers to answer that question or to address whether apps are an improvement.</p><p>Jenni worries that apps are displacing all alternatives:</p>\r\n<p>I’m a 25-year-old woman, currently in grad school. I feel like (or at least hope that) I’m part of a silent majority of people in my generation who hate dating apps. I find them very surface-level and honestly struggle to see myself ending up with someone I met on an app. I also think they are negatively changing the rest of the dating landscape. The dating apps have created a culture in which people seem afraid to try for an organic connection in the “real world,” as the apps provide the illusion that the other people on them are ready for a relationship (a debatable premise). I also think they reduce the possibility of organic connections. When I started my graduate school program I assumed a lot of people would be single like me and looking for like-minded people to date; instead, almost everyone in my grad school cohort is dating someone. Many of them met on an app. Am I on the apps? Yes, but only as I feel like I [don’t] have much choice.</p>\r\n<p>Sharon tried online dating––perhaps in Las Vegas?––but didn’t like the outcome:</p>\r\n<p>I’ve tried these dating sites, which are pig-in-a-poke and not nearly as successful as moving around in many social contexts. I once filled out a long “application” process listing every imaginable interest and preference (I’m an overeducated classical musician). I was matched with an Elvis impersonator, complete with gold chains. If you can’t do better than that unassisted, there’s something wrong with you!</p>\r\n<p>Alison met her match the old-fashioned way: CompuServe.</p>\r\n<p>Back in the early days of the internet, when connection was dial-up and images were limited to type on the screen, there was a company called CompuServe, which ran various discussion boards called forums (yes, I know, they couldn’t be bothered with correct Latin and call them “Fora”). In 1992 or 1993, I joined one called RockNet, where people met to discuss rock music; I made a lot of friends all over the world and, eventually, “met” Chris, a Montrealer who shared my love of Billy Bragg and the Jazz Butcher (among many others). Lo, he had a trip planned to San Francisco, where we met in person and subsequently fell in love. Fast forward to 1996, when I moved to Montreal to be with him, and we married. And now, 26 years later, we’re still together and very happy. Is this an example of “finding love through technology,” or a simple matter of luck—because certainly proximity came last, not first! Either way, an outcome to cherish.</p>\r\n<p>[Read: The uncertain forecast for Europe’s energy crisis]</p><p>Alex is a deeply ambivalent dating-app user searching for love and marriage:</p>\r\n<p>I’m a 32-year-old man seeking women, and in one sense, dating apps have been a lifeline. I work for a tiny company with only three or four colleagues, all men, and I’ve worked from home for almost five years now, so I’m not going to meet a potential partner through work. I’m not a churchgoer, so church is out. I live in a different state from my family and my friends have moved all over the country, so personal networks aren’t too helpful either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dating apps are an easy, ready-made way to meet people. At the same time, I lament the void left by the continued erosion of communities. My best friend is deeply involved in a tight-knit religious community. Gossipy church ladies will play matchmaker (“He should meet your daughter! They’re about the same age!”), friends will hook each other up (“I know somebody who knows somebody who’s single!”), and relationships and marriages happen quickly. My friend met his future wife through a mutual friend, proposed six months later, and married five months after that. I peer into this world from the outside and long for it. Even if it comes with gossip, politics, and drama, I long most of all for help, for a break from shouldering the burden of searching for a partner alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’ve become a fairly experienced app dater out of necessity. I applied myself and learned the necessary skills: how to take great pictures (for God’s sake, straight men, ask a woman to take your profile pictures), how to write a killer bio (for God’s sake, say what you’re looking for), and how to suss out the vibe of potential matches from texting alone. I’ve met lots of interesting women and gone on good dates. Still, all my strongest feelings have been for women I’ve met in person. There’s a chemical reaction that comes from locking eyes with someone across the room that apps just can’t replicate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So here’s what I would say to that original Twitter poster. If they’re still in school, I would tell them that is a wonderful gift: the best chance you’ll ever have to meet people your own age. Every semester brings new classes, new people, daily face-to-face contact (pandemics notwithstanding), every opportunity in the world for sparks to fly. The search for love looks a lot different when you’re sitting in a home office seeing the same four walls every day. I view apps as a necessary evil, based on the individualistic society we have and my life circumstances, but if I could, I’d ditch them.</p>\r\n<p>Jack’s HR-noncompliant advice––meet at work:</p>\r\n<p>I met my wife of 20-plus years by working with her on very high-stakes company projects we both were very excited by. I don’t think there’s a better way—intense discussions, deeply motivated to come up with genius ideas. She shared all kinds of brilliant thoughts that sent me home thinking about her thoughts. I found falling in love with her easy once I had seen such smarts in action … traits that would not have come out had our experience with each other been limited to scoring concert tickets and ski-lift reservations.</p>\r\n<p>Katerina met her fiancé at a singles’ mixer organized by a local church and prefers the old-fashioned approach:</p>\r\n<p>We never would have matched on a dating app. Not only would we have fallen outside of each other’s age ranges (I’m 28; he’s 37), but the way we were presenting ourselves on apps wouldn’t have appealed to the other person. I had all these political and lifestyle “filters” vetting dates on categories that ultimately didn’t matter to a stable, happy relationship. I went on seven first (dating-app) dates in a row and I remember the early excitement of each match, the slow build of the “talking phase,” and then in each case the disappointment when we didn’t connect well in person. His experience was similar. The more you can personalize a dating app like you would your DoorDash order, the more likely you are to be disappointed when someone doesn’t meet every single quality you set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m so glad that he and I met in real life instead. We connected in part because just being at the event meant we shared a connection to this faith community that was important to us. And the differences we had ended up being sources of balance and enrichment in the relationship. But the important part was that we got to feel a “click” or “spark” before any of those differences made us filter the other person out. Dating apps give you a false sense of control over your romantic life. It’s not “settling” to find someone who shares the priorities that matter and is willing to work through the rest! For more lasting relationships I almost feel like apps need to give people fewer options, not more.</p>\r\n<p>David has met three wives online:</p>\r\n<p>In the 1980s, I was a very shy young man whose nonexistent romantic life was saved by online dating. Before online dating, I had to try to discern whether or not a complete stranger had any interest in spending time with me—a terrifying guess. With online dating, you know that the person is at least interested enough to meet, or not, without suffering any real-time in-person humiliation. Virtual humiliation was easier for me to take.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past 35 years, I found three wives online, and though two of them passed away, I am very happy with my romantic experiences, and my current wife is wonderful. I did not use dating apps but online services (Match and others), and I was always looking for potential relationships, not hookups. Algorithms did not choose dates for me; I chose potential dates based on posted profiles, and potential dates accepted or rejected me based on my posted profile. Sure, some profiles were more accurate than others, and I had my share of “bad dates,” but I typically arranged for a good meal so, at a minimum, both of us ate well even if we did not hit it off. I tried to set a high floor. I think that if one is patient, realistic, and honest, online-dating services can work well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in older age groups, they tend to favor men over women because there are fewer older men. Great for men, but it can be tough for divorcées and widows of a certain age.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I am not perfect, I did not seek perfection but someone at my level (or just slightly above) with compatible values—honesty, kindness, empathy, independence, and resilience are way up there for me. I suspect that knowing what works for you, and being realistic about your appeal, and lack thereof, really improves one’s odds. What some may deem “settling” I see as retaining some humility and some semblance of objectivity. There are a lot of wonderful people out there who were not prom queens, valedictorians, heiresses, Nobel Prize winners, etc. I do not believe that partners often fix or save each other, but they can complement each other. I feel incredibly lucky to have found my current wife, and we would not have found each other without online dating.</p>\r\n<p>Ben believes that a dating app for Mormons has given him insights into dating apps more generally:</p>\r\n<p>I’m a member of a minority religious community (the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also called LDS or Mormon), and some enterprising member of the church has created an LDS-specific dating app called Mutual to help members of the church meet up. The app is fairly widespread among young LDS people, and because of the unique cultural/religious aspects of its users, it avoids the most egregious problems with other dating apps. For one, it doesn't mix those looking for casual sex and those looking for longer-term relationships, since it is widely understood that members of the church don’t (for the most part) sleep together before marriage. Secondly, based on talking to women who use the app, dick pics are almost nonexistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would seem that, with some of the worst sexual aggression, misbehavior, and manipulation eliminated, this app would lead to better outcomes, successful relationships, and more perfect power couples, right? And yet, every time I talk to someone who uses the app, the strongest positive reaction I can get is a “Meh,” or possibly “It's fun to go on and see who is there.” More often, the reaction is “I’ve felt better ever since I stopped using it.” Even in a community with clearer expectations around dating, a slower pace when it comes to sexual relations, and norms protecting against the worst misbehavior, these apps still don’t work well, because they encourage participants to dehumanize each other and themselves, to evaluate artificial performances of attractiveness and to put on one of their own. Apps perpetuate the myth that attraction is something that exists, that you either have it toward someone or you don’t, when in reality, attraction tends to build (or diminish) as you get to know someone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the advantage of marrying a classmate, or a cousin’s friend, or someone from your old congregation is that you have an accurate picture of who they are, which you can evaluate in addition to physical and social aspects. In short, apps are wrong from the beginning about the way that good romances form for most people, and eliminating some of their worst aspects (whether that be sexual aggression or ghosting) won’t fix the fact that their solution doesn’t fix the underlying problem. Some people get lucky, and a broken tool still works for them, but by and large, people end up feeling more isolated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apps misapprehend the true bottlenecks that keep more people from finding partners. Seeing a sufficient number of attractive people is not the limiting factor in most people’s lives. Ironically, I think the original poster is correct, in that most marriages from “the old days” involved settling. But I also think that’s the right way to form a relationship; everyone settles for their partner, and everyone’s partner settles for them. There’s no such thing as a ready-made “soul mate” (if you get a soul mate, it is only through years of working on each other’s flaws and learning to appreciate each other more), and searching for one wastes time you could spend learning the hard work of loving another person and changing your life and personality to serve them, while they do the same for you.</p>\r\n<p>M. is a 73-year-old woman. There was a time when apps might have helped her. She writes:</p>\r\n<p>I got pregnant at 18. Was I in love? No. Did I opt to keep the baby? Yes. I decided to do it on my own. 1968. But my parents forced a marriage on me. We divorced three years later (he left me).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was left penniless with a 3-year-old. It took a while to figure [out] my way forward. It took 12 years to find the man I wanted to be with through mutual friends. We have been happily married for 40 years. Would I have had better luck with a dating app? Over those 12 years, I suspect so.</p>\r\n<p>Glenn is suspicious of modern love:</p>\r\n<p>We live today with the romantic myth that love is some kind of wonderful and/or awful disease that we may or may not catch, and may or may not get over. What we fall into we can very easily fall out of. It happens to us, or does not happen to us, and we have very little say. This is the stuff of every cheap romance novel, movie, poem, love song, and Hallmark card. It is the modern version of the old pagan myth of Cupid hunting us down and inflicting us with uncontrolled destiny. It is strange that in such a modern, prosaic world we take such an ancient and poetic, even magical, view of our emotional lives. I will doubtless be cast aside as an unromantic clod for saying so, but here goes: Love is not a feeling that leads to a commitment. Love is a commitment that leads to a feeling! The emotional ties follow the commitment. The commitment does not follow the emotions. Our first inclination is to rebel against such a view. It certainly won’t be the plot line of our pop culture’s next great rom-com. But how else are we to explain the endless long succession of unfulfilled and unfulfilling relationships that litter our cultural landscape today? The high divorce rate? The unending series of deeply important obsessive relationships, until they turn out not to be so important after all as soon as we are distracted by the potential of something new and mysterious and other?</p>\r\n<p>He counsels putting our trust in God and man:</p>\r\n<p>Jesus commanded us to love one another. He was not asking us to conjure up some emotion out of thin air. He was commanding us to commit to one another. I don’t always feel in love, especially when last night’s dinner sits heavy on my stomach. We humans can often fool ourselves into equating lust with love, or atmosphere with emotion, or mere physical attraction with true spiritual virtue. Feelings are ephemeral, fleeting, and fickle things. My commitments are a much more substantial and ultimately sustaining bond than my emotions. My commitments are a truer and more lasting expression of my inner self. My emotions may lie to me; my commitments never do. I [have been] faithfully committed to the love of my life for 30 years now, and it feels great!</p>\r\n<p>[Read: The question of defunding police]</p><p>Dan wonders if Stephen Stills didn’t have it right:</p>\r\n<p>In hindsight, I did settle. My ex-wife would say the same. We “settled” with each other, mostly because we both were young and insecure. But several fine children and grandchildren came out of our relationship. Settling wasn’t so unsettling after all. Perhaps we would have done better by committing to settling more; you know, “Love the one you’re with”?</p>\r\n<p>Leila believes apps have been especially beneficial to queer people:</p>\r\n<p>I’ve dated online and offline, in queer circles and straight ones. My biggest takeaway is that online dating is a reflection of my generation rather than a root cause of its problems. It’s harder for queer people to date offline. Approaching a stranger of the same sex in a coffee shop is outright dangerous in most parts of the world (and many parts of North America). Even if you’re not surrounded by homophobia, the numbers are against you—there are fewer gay people in the world than straight ones. As a result, queer people looking to date have three options: Move to a city, date a friend, or turn to an app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was lucky to grow up in a diverse city. Since it’s always been obvious that I’m attracted to women, I had no trouble finding queer communities in my teens. I met people at parties and picnics. With real-life dating, you get to learn your partner’s coffee order and the sound of their laugh, to experience a period of human intimacy even if you never end up having sex. Getting to know a potential partner as a person rather than a profile is rewarding. Scrolling through an app feels like a chore or a bad habit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But apps can be useful if they can facilitate real-life connections. In the early days of the pandemic, I went out with a girl I met on Tinder. We planned outdoor dates for each other and talked about our lives. Getting to know someone far away from my social circle was refreshing. Other than the fact that our first conversation took place through a screen, the experience felt a lot like real life. Real-life connections, however, can have disastrous consequences. Falling in love with my high-school best friend was the most painful experience of my life. Losing a friend feels a lot worse than getting ghosted, so I can understand why many are eager to avoid dating people they know in the flesh.</p>\r\n<p>Errol hates the turn toward apps:</p>\r\n<p>Why do people seem more afraid of the person they meet at the grocery store than the guy who they matched with who wants to go on a hike outside the city? I’m retired from dating because of the unwritten rule that apps are the only way to meet people. Apps encourage you to view yourself as a product, and to make that product as appealing as possible. I’m pro-capitalism. But I have my limits when it comes to personal interactions. I love the apps for those who have trouble connecting to strangers, but let the outgoing go out.</p>\r\n<p>Liam recounts his Irish youth:</p>\r\n<p>I am 62 and grew up in Dublin when even phone landlines were not ubiquitous. To meet, you had to go to places where there were people, e.g., pubs, parties, other people’s houses, dances. You had to actually talk to people and deal with possible rejection. You had to learn to be charming, or at least interesting. You ended up meeting a lot of annoying people that you disagreed with. Some became close friends or lovers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My secondary school and university were full of thriving clubs where people pretended to be interested in topics or activities so they could meet people. It wasn’t easy to get laid (or “hook up,” as younger people call it) which wasn’t helped by the fact that Ireland then was still very Catholic. But we did get laid. I never used a dating app (if I was single I would use it in a heartbeat), but getting to know people by chatting them up, then slowly falling in love, is not a bad way to spend one’s time. It is also a way to find out more about yourself. I suspect that it is a better way to find one’s soulmate than an algorithm.</p>\r\n<p>Karen’s marriage wasn’t great, “but it was a durable one that survived across time and trouble,” and she doubts that she would have been better off in the app era:</p>\r\n<p>A dating app is an illusion machine, or maybe a delusion machine. The fantasy is that there are always more possibilities out there, available to you with no more effort than brushing right or left. As long as you search online, you needn’t worry that you are seldom presentable. You can slide right past the person who failed to list similar interests. Disappointments are mostly quick and private. There’s no opportunity for chemistry until the brief encounter where you fail to find it. Strangers add up as though you’re working on some demented survey of the opposite sex. It’s always been hard to meet someone, especially after college, in a new town, at a new job or even an old one. The pool isn’t infinite; time isn’t either. Marriages are not statistical matchups made by cupid programmers. You choose a mate and then you have a marriage to work at, however you found the match.</p>\r\n<p>Russ counsels meeting people in person and focusing on their best qualities:</p>\r\n<p>I am a 62-year-old male, with vast experience dating literally hundreds of individuals. My worst two dates were women I met online. Scary even. I never wanted that third strike. But as to how to meet potential mates (or hookups): Obviously, get out of the house, and less obviously, perhaps, put your phone down and leave it down. If you see someone who intrigues you, determine right away whether they are appealing to your heart or your loins. Honesty is key to any good relationship and starts with being honest with yourself. Follow that with introducing yourself. Don’t use pickup lines; just be real. If you introduce yourself it is generally assumed there is some level or type of attraction. And finally, don’t be a snob. No one is perfect, so do not ignore warning bells, but try to view the person in favorable lights. Generally speaking, everybody has some good qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a score of long-term relationships (more than one year); some were tall, some were short, some skinny, most chubby. Some were smart, some were very nice, some were Black, and some were white. But we seemed to always be compatible for a period of time; in love, even. Hundreds were just about the sex, and that worked both ways. But I have no experience or advice on how to maintain that for years without end.</p>\r\n<p>Angelle’s story appears to have a happy ending:</p>\r\n<p>I am female but my observation is that online dating works far better for us than for men. Men are still mostly the pursuers, and most still prefer to do the choosing. I am not afraid to ask for the first date, but it wasn’t often well received. Women get so many more contacts usually than men do. Especially the women who are the most attractive. I got enough interest to keep me busy, but those women could get 1,000 messages a day; they have a lot of choices. Men who are not in the same stratosphere have trouble getting responses; they get depressed and then some get angry and bitter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A con, at least for me as a somewhat traditional woman, was the amount of unsolicited  body-part pix I got and the number of men looking for “intimate encounters,” who didn’t understand the phrase not interested. I actually experienced one attempted physical assault I didn’t see coming, on a first date; a verbal attack in public; and a few [instances of] getting stood up. Had I met these men in person, I think I would have picked up on this kind of thing right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was on online-dating services (before smartphones) for about seven years. I had a lot of first dates and met a lot of nice guys. But I only ever had a few short-term relationships (a month or two) and one that lasted a year. I started the online-dating thing because there are just not many places where I am to meet men. Not going to hang out at bars … lol. I am still single, but I have met someone by chance through looking for a job after I lost mine because of COVID. This never used to happen, and now it has.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am tickled because I think I may have finally found the right guy. We have taken time to get to know each other and have become really good friends, something I think should be the first part. Many from the dating site were in a big hurry to get to the end. Whichever end they wanted. I don’t believe in fate, but it seems the universe is on my side for once.</p>\r\n<p>Marek recommends seeing how a potential partner handles the possibility of shipwreck:</p>\r\n<p>I went on a two-week trip on a three-masted sailing ship, where we worked as unpaid crew. The woman I met there had much in common by virtue of also going (single and without knowing anyone) on the same trip. We’ve been happily married for 28 years. Seeking out an arena that reflects you is a good way of filtering potential partners. It’s also easier to bluff online than out on a yardarm in a storm. The latter provides true insight. My sympathy to young people. While their choices seem freer, they are that much harder to navigate.</p>\r\n<p>And Earl, who also went to sea, shares the story of his romantic life:</p>\r\n<p>In 1960, a fellow freshman at Tulane introduced me to his sister, a high-school student. Janet was intelligent, inquisitive, lively, and fond of literature. We became friends, occasionally having a date. By the time I graduated in 1963, she was at Tulane, and we were an inchoate version of a couple. She was at my side when I was commissioned from NROTC as an ensign, U.S. Navy. I left for sea duty and a career in the Navy. We promised to “keep in touch.” There was a sense of commitment, very soft, and not just a farewell phrase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping in touch from a ship in the mid-1960s was done by letters, handwritten or typed on my portable Smith Corona typewriter that I couldn’t use in heavy weather unless I tied it down. We wrote several times a month as I told her about Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. I would not be home for a year. We reconnected then, sensed the connection was stronger, but knew that her commitment to education and mine to the Navy precluded personal plans. I had three more years of obligated service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June 1965, I left the war zone in the South China Sea and came home for a couple of weeks. The brother who had introduced us was well into medical school, and Janet was determined to follow. Medical school and sea duty were not conducive to any romantic commitment. We kept together with more letters and, while in port, lots of quarters fed into pay telephones. At Christmas 1965, I was able to get home for a couple of weeks, but in 1966 the ship’s schedule became more intense. I was spending a lot of time at sea, usually three weeks or more at a time. I would not be able to come home for summer leave. Besides, Janet was taking a course at the University of Minnesota to ensure that she would be accepted into her second year of medical school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the summer of 1966, amid a huge airline strike, I was able to get away for a few days, flying from Charleston to Minneapolis with the aid of my summer-white uniform and sympathetic airline people. Those few days taught us that, whether we wanted to admit it or not, we belonged together. Back at sea I decided it was time to change my life. I resolved to apply to law school and to resign my commission when my obligation expired. In March 1968 we were married after eight years of what used to be called “courtship.” She was between her second and third years of medical school; I was a freshman in law school. We both graduated in June 1970 and became an oddity for those times, a doctor-lawyer marriage in which the doctor was female. Three sons and five grandchildren followed. Despite being a physician and many visits to MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Janet died in January 2017, leaving me with many exciting memories.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you to everyone who shared your stories, and may you all find (or keep) love.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Ukrainian troops filmed themselves retaking posts along the border with Russia — a sign of the frantic evacuation of the occupying army from the region around the country’s second city of Kharkiv after Ukraine’s startling counter-attack last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The incontrovertible evidence of the Russian army’s failure is creating unprecedented disarray among Moscow propagandists who both reflect and shape public opinion, while spurring euphoria in Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Very many skeptics have begun a total re-evaluation — and soon they will rush to be friends with us,” said  Alexei Arestovich, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The atmosphere is a lot sourer in Moscow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking on a live chat show, former Duma deputy Boris Nadezhdin said that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been misled by his advisers that Ukraine would be easy to conquer and that Russian troops would be greeted as liberators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have to understand that it is absolutely impossible to defeat Ukraine using those resources and colonial war methods with which Russia is trying to wage war,” he said on the broadcast tracked by Julia Davis, a journalist who created the Russian Media Monitor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A strong army is opposing the Russian army,” he said, adding that Russia should begin peace talks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But others are advocating an even more ruthless approach to Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>State Duma Deputy Sergey Mironov called the Kyiv government “a Nazi regime” and said it “had to be destroyed.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of the English-language broadcaster RT and who is under sanction by the EU, called on Russian forces to attack Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure — something that’s a war crime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There are nuclear power plants there, a lot of infrastructure which can be disabled … very quickly and easily, and for a long time,” she said in a Sunday night broadcast. “People ask me, why don’t we do that? I have no answer. Perhaps now is the time to do this?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the approach that the stunned Russian military is adopting in a bid to exact revenge for its humiliating retreat. Russian missiles rained down on Kharkiv on Sunday, hitting a power generating station and plunging the city into darkness for several hours. Power was also partially knocked out in the regions of Poltava, Sumy and Dnipropetrovsk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday afternoon, Kharkiv faced a new blackout. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Last night’s situation has been repeated. Due to shelling, critical infrastructure facilities were disabled, as a result of which both power and water supply was halted,” said the city’s Mayor Ihor Terekhov.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Igor Girkin, the former Russian officer who was one of the instigators of the 2014 war in eastern Ukraine, called the strikes on the power plants “very useful.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Russia’s “barbaric shelling … once again proved that we confront terrorists.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the Russian retaliation isn’t slowing the Ukrainian military, which on Monday continued to advance against the Russians, while social media was filled with films of Ukrainian troops taking vast amounts of abandoned ammunition, tanks and weapons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the weekend, the Russians pulled back from most of Kharkiv region, allowing the Ukrainians to push their troops right to the international border. Although the Russians are trying to form a new defensive line along the Oskil River in the east of the region, there are reports that it has already been penetrated by the Ukrainian military. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ukrainian Defence Ministry also said that four villages had been retaken near Kherson in the south of the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Girkin said that Ukrainian artillery was firing on the village of Novomykhailivka, not far from the city of Donetsk, which is one of Russia’s main conquests from 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arestovich said “the phase of breakthrough, rapid advance, tsunami” is being replaced by “a phase of consolidation of results as well as battles for the most beneficial frontiers — as springboards for the next jumps.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He warned that attacking civilian targets would only bring more aid from Ukraine’s allies and “accelerate the fall of the Putin regime.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Californian and the Englishman had more in common than might have seemed apparent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both were young scions of political dynasties. Their early interest in the environment would blossom over time into urgent climate-change evangelism. They shared a fondness for an economist who stressed caution about growth and technological progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But only one would become king.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then-Gov. Jerry Brown and then-Prince Charles were still young men when they hosted each other in Sacramento and London in 1977. (They would meet a third time — and ride a ferry across San Francisco Bay — in 2005.) Now the 84-year-old Brown is retired after towering over California politics in four terms as governor. While Brown never attained the highest office, falling short in his presidential runs, Charles has finally ascended to the throne at 73.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking from the ranch in rural Colusa County where his pet corgi roams (yes, Brown favors the same breed as the late Queen Elizabeth) Brown recounted those long-ago encounters, what you serve a prince for lunch, his and Charles’ shared interest in the environment and the types of questions one simply does not ask a king-in-waiting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeremy White: How did you come to meet each other in Sacramento back in 1977?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jerry Brown: He just came to Sacramento for a visit and the protocol suggested, I believe, that he should check in with the governor and he did. So I think I picked him up at the airport in the famous blue Plymouth [Satellite]. He met people in my office in the council chamber and then we had a light lunch of sandwiches with some kind of traditional English dessert. Simple — we had a pudding, I think — and we talked and that was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then later, I can’t tell you how much longer, I went to England to speak at a funeral of E.F. Schumacher, the author of Small Is Beautiful. And so I was invited to dinner at Buckingham Palace. There were about 10 people. And so that’s when I saw him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then saw him again when I was mayor of Oakland. He came to Oakland and then he took the ferry across to San Francisco. So that was the three times I’ve encountered him and it’s always very pleasant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White: There’s a somewhat famous photo of you two that first time. I believe that the-then prince is sort of peering into the sandwich bag and it was reported at the time there was a beansprout sandwich or something like that. Do you recall?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown: No, they were cold cuts of some kind. Very appropriate. Where is that picture? Can you send a copy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White: This wasn’t something where this was considered beneath the station of the heir to the throne?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown: Well, not beneath the governor. This was the time of some simplicity in government, this [was] my era of limits, so I didn’t want some big banquet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White: To that point, at that time you were seen as something of an iconoclast, maybe an ascetic, sleeping on the famous mattress and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown: Between grand banquets and lavish fundraisers and just a simple meal or simple dinner is a long way before you get to asceticism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White: I take your point. I still wonder, though, if there was maybe a gap in your experiences or your stylistic preferences there, what with all the trappings of the crown versus some of your lifestyle choices at the time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown: You mean there was a gap? He seemed to fit in very smoothly. I didn’t notice any discomfort at all. Royalty has to learn to get along with a whole wide range of people on every continent, and certainly, he was a gracious visitor and I think everybody was excited to meet him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White: After you saw him the second time you said to the press, “The closer the leaders can be to the lifestyle in the ways that the population have to follow, the better the democracy itself.” Was that a precept that you thought the prince seemed to follow?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown: Different governments do different things. Obviously, the royals in England have a great deal of pomp and ceremony … But I think more simplicity is best. For the president’s inauguration you have a certain amount of ceremony, that’s in order. But certainly excess is never good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White: You mentioned that you shared some admiration for E.F. Schumacher. You were there for his funeral. Obviously, [he was] somebody who’s very much associated with being skeptical about excessive technology and consumption, that type of thing, the era of limits, as you mentioned. Was that something that you felt the prince was drawn to as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown: Well, I think he does have acute interest in environmental issues, in architecture, and in tradition. So, in one sense, preserving the environment is analogous to preserving traditions. Unlike some kind of entrepreneur that is constantly looking for change, and seeing everything in dollars and cents, Charles sees things in quality, not just quantity, and he sees the pattern of culture and the pattern of environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think he’s aware there’s a certain integrity that should be respected. He does express that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White: The two of you discussed solar energy, is that right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown: We probably did. I used to talk about that with people. That was certainly a topic that was on people’s minds and was on my mind. We had a 55 percent tax credit for installing a solar collector, which at that time were solar-thermal, mostly tubes that you put on your roof that heat water [and] that can provide heating. But photovoltaics came way down in cost. And that became the solar of today. But the idea of getting energy from the sun, as opposed from oil and gas, that was an idea that I was very interested in, and obviously I would raise it with Prince Charles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White: Back in that time, of course, climate change was not a phrase that was as in the public consciousness as it is now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown: It really didn’t occur until James Hansen testified before Congress in the late 80s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White: And yet now, both of you have become really sort of two of the most vocal world leaders on the urgency of addressing that issue. Is that something that you could have foreseen at that at that early meeting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown: Hard to tell. There is this tradition which royalty embodies, [which] is less open to change. And environmental rules, environmentalism, is saying, “Well, okay, what are you doing with fossil fuel? It’s changing the atmosphere for the bad.” So, we want to stop this change and create a world more consistent with the past world or with what we now call a sustainable world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could see that he naturally would support environmentalism. You find that often. There’s a certain aristocratic element in the environmental movement, in fact some people even accuse it of being not sensitive enough to low-income people, and that’s why the environmental justice movement has come to the fore. But it’s important because the swashbuckling entrepreneur that wants to just build and grow regardless of any negative environmental impact, that’s something that Charles would be very dubious of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White: At the time of your initial meeting, you had said something about the prince expressing concern about the dehumanizing aspect of technology and the need to preserve the role of the individual. Do you recall talking about the pitfalls of technological progress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown: You look for common things to talk about, and now we have a much deeper sense of technology and technology tends to shape people to fit the technology. It’s supposed to be that these are our tools, the tools to develop greater flexibility, and sophistication and human being has to be fitted to the tool. I think the prince, in some form, he was talking about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White: At that time, governor, you still had some presidential runs ahead of you. Of course, the prince was in the line of succession to be king. Obviously slightly different paths to higher office. But was that something that loomed over your meetings, that you were both potentially on a path?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown: I’m not sure what loomed might look like, but I would say no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White: Was that something you’ve discussed, ascending to the higher office potentially?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown: No. You don’t talk to a prince, say “How do you feel about being king?” That would not be something I would say.</p>",

In this article author Susan D'Agostino outlines why publishers are \"expressed concern\" over the U.S. government's open access mandate for federally funded research. The article cites without irony an objection from Ithaka (think: JSTOR): \"If I can get $1 million from a grant maker, do I use $100,000 [of that sum] to pay for another postdoc or to pay for open-access publishing charges?\" What, like that's the only way to provide open access to research results? Seriously? Here's a better plan (and this plan has been around for decades): take the money you've been spending on book and journal purchases, and instead spend it on institutional archives, then share your archive with everybody. That's how you pay for open access (and save a bundle in the process).</p>\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

So whatever may be Philip Kerr's specific criticisms of the MiLLaT (Mediation in Language Learning and Teaching) guides for Language Teachers (here and here), I would certainly take issue with his reduction of the terms used to describe mediation as 'group work' and 'writing'. I'm also concerned that \"a selection of the activities suggested in MiLLaT\" leaves him \"wondering what some of this has to do with mediation\" because - from my perspective - it's pretty easy to draw the connection between the skills being developed and the actual practice of mediation. Now it may be that merging mediation training with a language teaching is maybe not the best idea in the world. Each is hard enough on its own. That said, I think that for the small of funding (€80K) they received, the MiLLaT  group did a decent job.</p>\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

        "description": "<p>Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) has introduced separate legislation to overhaul the permitting process for energy projects, as Democrats debate a similar proposal agreed on by Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Capito, the ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, presented the bill as necessary to give industry “regulatory certainty.” She also said the proposal would expedite the completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a project set to run through West Virginia. Manchin has made the completion of the pipeline a major priority, and the summary of the side deal reached with Schumer includes removing several obstacles to the goal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The West Virginia Republican also framed her separate introduction of a bill as in response to the lack of public text from Manchin, who has thus far released a summary of the proposal.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Since our calls for action and offers to see legislative text from the permitting ‘deal’ remain unheeded, Republicans are introducing this legislation today to deliver solutions to the roadblocks, delays, and postponements of key infrastructure projects across the country,” Capito said in a statement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thirty-eight Senate Republicans co-sponsored the measure, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Minority Whip John Thune (S.D.) and Energy Committee ranking member Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.).   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After over a year of negotiations, Manchin struck a deal with Schumer to support a sweeping Democratic climate and infrastructure bill in exchange for agreeing to introduce the separate permitting reform bill. The side bill has sparked fierce backlash from climate hawks in the Democratic caucus, and it remains unclear if Republican support for the measure exists to offset any Democrats who decline to support it.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) led more than 70 House Democrats in a letter asking House leadership not to include Manchin’s measure in stopgap funding that will prevent a government shutdown. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The inclusion of these provisions in a continuing resolution, or any other must-pass legislation, would silence the voices of frontline and environmental justice communities by insulating them from scrutiny,” they wrote.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3639217-a-psychology-based-recipe-for-climate-action/",
        "description": "<p>Recent brutal weather will be everyday life if we fail to act on climate change. Our planet's north and south poles experienced record heatwaves —simultaneously —in March of this year. The Texas power grid failed last year, and demand recently exceeded California’s and New York’s combined. A headline read, \"Lake Mead, once the largest water reservoir in the U.S., now little more than a graveyard.” Throughout Europe, people are fighting deadly heat shocks like those already familiar in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. Against presumed odds, this summer’s heat emergencies are happening despite a La Nina weather pattern that usually has a temporary global cooling effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can we all tattoo “preventable surprises” on our foreheads? We have long known climate change’s causes, consequences and solutions. Nonetheless, our vast knowledge isn’t yet translating into enough action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest challenge now is to change how we collectively think and act. Here is a psychology-based recipe for engaging in climate action more urgently, effectively and successfully. Every ingredient will be helpful for the rest of our lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Face reality</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to rampant mis- and disinformation, scientists are nearly unanimous: Climate change is here, it's worsening, it's human-caused, and it portends a dire future if we don't get our act together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We must reduce greenhouse gas emissions — and prepare for inevitable weather disasters, food and water shortages, worsening injustices, social conflict and much more. Acting now will cost far less as well as be far more successful than waiting and being forced to act later with fewer options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Know thy climate self</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people overestimate their climate-friendly actions. Assess your climate actions and inaction and congratulate yourself only when warranted. Consider your skills, personal contacts, opportunities, and other resources and determine how to best leverage them into helpful climate action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accept a share of responsibility for the future</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some are more responsible than others for our current plight, of course. However, going forward, we need a broad sharing of responsibility for taking better to limit and adapt to climate change. Feeling some responsibility for helping to achieve a meaningful goal like managing climate change is a powerful motivator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw made a similar point noting, “We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future.” For more musical guidance, let’s collectively follow Tom Petty’s “I’m taking control of my life now. Right now. Oh, yeah.” Our wisest path forward is to take control of our future by demanding more proactive leadership from our policymakers and influencers (formal and informal) in every sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognize and exercise your agency</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have more power to help save the environment than you probably think. We have technologies to limit and reverse global warming; it’s myopic psychology, self- sabotage and lack of political will that hold us back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of us (M. Mann) noted in his 2021 book “The New Climate War,” campaigning for systemic change can succeed when 25 percent of the public accepts the need. The challenge is that we may “approach one of these climate tipping points before we approach the other tipping point – the tipping point in the public consciousness.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can rise to this challenge, but only if we decide to exercise our agency to bring about changes to our political, economic, technological and social systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your impact can be profound when contributing to our collective agency — power in numbers. Examples are voting, influencing policy, filing class action suits against climate culprits and protesting peacefully. We, and the representatives we elect, really can hold the worst polluters responsible for their actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid backsliding</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When news of progress appears, beware of moral licensing — the tendency to do or learn something commendable, slacking, and failing to keep up the excellent work. No more slip-sliding away from climate action and climate justice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rally around climate supergoals</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A superordinate goal is a person’s, an organization’s, or even a country's guiding principle or purpose. It is a genuinely compelling vision with a broader scope and longer time horizon than the subgoals that support it. When two or more parties value the same superordinate goal and cooperation can help achieve it, productive collaboration can develop between antagonists. Transitioning to clean energy is a superordinate goal that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy dependence, strengthen national security and the economy, and help save the planet. Shortly after the passage of the most sweeping climate plan in U.S. history, the Inflation Reduction Act, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm called clean energy “the greatest peace plan of all.\" Government officials like Granholm now see opportunities to export clean energy and to play a leadership role in “bringing that peace plan to the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is another lofty supergoal: helping our species evolve more quickly, culturally if not yet biologically. Other species accelerate their evolution to survive climate change; many fail while others succeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Humans do not capitalize nearly enough on our key evolutionary advantages: envisioning likely and possible futures and adopting new ways of thinking and behaving. We squander these assets when past experiences, habits and circumstances prompt short-sighted business as usual and we neglect longer- term futures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas S. Bateman is professor emeritus with the McIntire School of Commerce, University of Virginia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael E. Mann is distinguished professor of atmospheric science and director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University. He is author of the recently released book, “The New Climate War: The Fight to Take Back Our Planet.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Chapek said in a new interview the company “stood our ground” against the “barrage” of attacks for their public disapproval of Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” legislation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published Monday, Chapek addressed his initial hesitance to speak out on the divisive bill, which he later apologized for. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When you’re a lightning rod for clicks and for political podium speeches, the essence of our brand can be misappropriated or misused to try to fit the needs of any one particular group’s agenda. We want to rise above that,” Chapek told the magazine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We certainly don’t want to get caught up in any political subterfuge, but at the same time we also realize that we want to represent a brighter tomorrow for families of all types, regardless of how they define themselves.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chapek also applauded how the company responded to backlash from political figures like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis once Disney did take a stand against the bill and paused political donations in the state. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are a very cohesive, big, happy family. I think our staff saw how I stood firm during the ultimate barrage of attacks from certain political constituencies and, frankly, I think it was much stronger and much longer and much harder than they ever could have imagined and we stood our ground,” Chapek told the outlet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So I think it’s safe to say that actions speak louder than words, and they saw resiliency and consistency no matter how strong the attacks,” Chapek added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disney is still facing the fallout from its public feud with DeSantis over its opposition to the Parental Rights in Education bill. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis signed into law a bill that strips Disney’s long-held municipal autonomy at their Orlando-based theme parks, also threatening to have state, not local governments, control the company’s special district. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The education legislation, often referred to as the “Don't Say Gay” bill, prohibits primary school teachers from classroom instruction related to sexual orientation and gender identity, while educators of all grade levels will be prohibited from instruction on those topics that is not “age appropriate or developmentally appropriate” for their students.</p>",

The governor’s move permits the State Fire Marshal to coordinate with other agencies and use outside sources to combat the blaze. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Authorities expect to fully contain the Double Creek Fire by Oct. 31. </p>\n\n\n\nMoose Fire\n\n\n\n<p>Idaho’s Moose Creek fire in Salmon-Challis National Forest, one of at least 33 large fires in the state, has burned since July 17, growing to nearly 126,000 acres over the weekend. The state’s active large fires have engulfed 248,456 acres thus far. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Moose Creek fire, which officials believe has a human source, is around 37 percent contained. Authorities estimate it will be fully contained by Oct. 1.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Authorities expect a change in weather beginning Monday afternoon, “bringing clouds, increasing humidity, possible erratic wind, and a decent chance of rain heading into the week.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several areas within Salmon-Challis National Forest have been closed due to the fire.</p>\n\n\n\nCedar Creek Fire\n\n\n\n<p>The Cedar Creek Fire near Oakridge, Oregon – 40 miles south of Eugene – began Aug. 1 due to a lightning strike. The blaze, one of ten active large fires in the state, has burned nearly 86,000 acres.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Officials said Sunday that the fire, one of nine across the state, grew by 32,000 acres over the weekend and breached existing lines, moving containment to zero percent.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 2,230 homes and 443 commercial structures remain threatened by the fire, officials added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The Cedar Creek Fire grew rapidly towards Oregon communities this morning, and the fire's growth potential in the coming days is troubling, requiring additional resources to battle the fire and support the state's response,\" Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said in statement Sept. 9, invoking the state’s conflagration act.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"This is a good reminder that conditions can change quickly, and that fire knows no bounds.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evacuations are in place in Lane and Deschutes Counties and closures are in effect for Waldo Lake and Three Sisters Wilderness.</p>\n\n\n\nMosquito Fire\n\n\n\n<p>Northern California’s Mosquito Fire has torched close to 47,000 acres in its first six days – consuming more than 3,000 acres in the past day alone.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Despite cooler temperatures, the historically dry fuel moisture in the vegetation continues driving the fire’s growth,” according to CalFire. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The agency added that the expected clear air Monday afternoon could lead to increased fire activity as seen in recent days. So far, the fire, one of 12 large active blazes in the state, is ten percent contained.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in El Dorado, Riverside and Placer counties due to fires, including the Mosquito Fire. Officials are still investigating the fire’s origin.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state has recorded nearly 6,300 fire incidents so far in 2022.</p>",

        "link": "https://arstechnica.com/?p=1880588",
        "description": "<p>Enlarge (credit: Intel)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Intel is gearing up to release the first products in its 13th-generation Core processor family, codenamed Raptor Lake. Among the topline facts that the company announced at its Intel Technology Tour is that at least one member of the Raptor Lake family will be capable of hitting 6 GHz out of the box (via Tom's Hardware). Core counts and architectural improvements are generally more important than clock speed when it comes to increasing a CPU's performance these days, but after many years hanging out in the 5 GHz range, it's neat to hit the next digit.</p>\n<p>As for what this means for performance, Intel is saying that Raptor Lake will perform roughly 15 percent better in single-threaded tasks and 41 percent better in multi-threaded workloads than the current 12th-generation Alder Lake chips. Clock speed is more important for boosting single-threaded performance, while adding more cores is usually the best way to improve multi-threaded speeds.</p>\n<p>It's not clear which of the CPUs will be capable of hitting 6 GHz or under what circumstances or for how long. An Intel SKU chart published by Igor's Lab suggests that the Core i9-13900K will top out at 5.8 GHz, though it's possible that it's capable of further boosting beyond that.</p><p>Read 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

        "description": "Photograph by Pug50 via Wikimedia Commons.\n<p>By Carol Tannenhauser</p>\n<p>This morning, in Monday Bulletin, we posted a story about the removal of lox from B’nai Jeshurun synagogue’s Community Kiddush menu. In a statement explaining the decision, Rabbi Shuli Passow, the director of community engagement at B’nai Jeshurun, wrote on the website, “What we eat and how we eat it should intentionally express our values…Lox will be eliminated from the menu so we can do our part to reduce the environmental impact of pollution and overfishing. We know that for some this is a heretical move! We are here to support you as you process this change.”</p>\n<p>Since then — and following an email from the Rag pointing out that most salmon consumed (60%) is farm grown —  B’nai Jeshurun has rolled back its statement and ban on lox. In a new statement to its congregation, posted Monday afternoon, it wrote:</p>\n<p>“…the removal of lox from our standard Kiddush menu has led to several misunderstandings we wish to clarify.</p>\n<p>* First, we inaccurately stated that consuming lox contributes to the overfishing of salmon. Most lox is, in fact, made from farmed Atlantic salmon. We thank those who brought this error to our attention, giving us the opportunity to correct our mistake.</p>\n<p>* Second, some felt that we implied that eating lox is immoral or that BJ is boycotting lox or lox providers. This could not be farther from the truth. Moreover, should anyone sponsoring Kiddush wish to include lox in the menu, they are welcome to do so.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, we chose to eliminate lox from non-sponsored community Kiddush because of its increasing cost as well as our desire to include more plant-based offerings at community meals.</p>\n<p>“One of BJ’s strengths is our commitment to open, honest dialogue, and we welcome the feedback that has been shared with us. We know there are many paths toward the world we wish to see and many ways to heal it. We are therefore grateful, especially in this season of teshuvah [repentence], for this opportunity to be more reflective and nuanced in our thinking about these decisions and in the way we communicate about them.</p>\n<p>“If you have any questions, please reach out to communications@bj.org and we’ll direct your question.”</p>",

        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/09/-pinocchio-carlo-collodi-book-disney-movie/671417/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "<p>Asked to name the two most important things about Pinocchio, most Americans would answer: First, his nose grows when he lies, and second, he is a wooden puppet who dreams of becoming a real boy. At this, Carlo Collodi would most likely shake his head. The 19th-century Italian author, who wrote the book that inspired the Disney movie and countless other adaptations (including the live-action reboot released last week and another version from the director Guillermo del Toro coming out later this year), saw his character very differently.</p><p>A radical political commentator who turned to children’s literature late in life, Collodi wrote a complex, unsettling novel—miles away from the morality tale that Pinocchio’s story has become. Collodi’s is a multilayered work of fiction that, although primarily aimed at young readers, is imbued with social criticism and pessimistic humor, and can be read, among other things, as an irreverent attack on established authority.</p><p>What became The Adventures of Pinocchio really encompasses two novels. In Italy, a Catholic country, the joke is that Pinocchio is “two in one,” just as God is “three in one.” Pinocchio was first published as a short serial of 15 episodes, from July to October 1881. It was brutal and frightening. The Fox and the Cat aren’t tricksters, but assassins. The Blue Fairy isn’t a reassuring motherly figure, but a ghostly and possibly dead little girl who refuses to help Pinocchio, because she’s “waiting for my coffin to come take me away.” Pinocchio grows his nose, but just to annoy Geppetto, and kills the Cricket in a fit of rage. Also, no happy ending: The puppet ends up dead, hanged on an oak tree.</p><p>But, likely prompted by the popularity of the story, Collodi resumed the serial the next year. Pinocchio, it turns out, wasn’t really dead. The 21 episodes that followed, published from February 1882 to January 1883, introduced the elements that the modern public would recognize and that eventually became fodder for Walt Disney. The uncanny little girl—who, the reader assumes, wasn’t really dead either—becomes a fairy, disciplines Pinocchio by making his nose grow when he lies, and promises to turn the puppet into a real boy if he starts behaving (which, spoiler alert, he eventually does). But the author’s attitude toward this redemption is ambivalent: Collodi, and with him the reader, roots for Pinocchio because the puppet is a mischievous rule breaker, not in spite of it. As the scholar Caterina Sinibaldi puts it, the “pedagogical attitude” is “ambiguous.”</p><p>[Read: Walt’s world]</p><p>The Adventures of Pinocchio, which combined both novels, was published as a book in February 1883, with minor changes. Different in tone and plot, Pinocchio’s two parts share the same themes. Poverty dominates throughout the story and is often the subject of bitter humor. “What’s your father’s name?” a character asks Pinocchio. “Geppetto,” Pinocchio responds. “And what’s his job?” “Being poor.” “Does he make a lot of money doing it?” Haunted by a “hunger so real it could be cut with a knife,” Pinocchio is reduced at various points to eating fruit cores and performing strenuous labor for a meager glass of milk. Distrust of authority is central as well. Doctors are pompous incompetents. One is said to “solemnly” intone, “When the dead cry, it means they’re on the way to recovering.” The police? Always blaming the victim. The judiciary? Literally apes. At one point, Pinocchio gets thrown behind bars for getting robbed—“This poor devil has been robbed of four gold coins. Therefore seize him and put him straight in jail”—and needs to convince the guards that he is not an innocent victim (“but I’m a crook too”) in order to be set free.</p><p>There is also a palpable sense of disillusionment. As the translators John Hooper and Anna Kraczyna note in a recent critical edition published by Penguin, it’s no coincidence that the utterance “Pazienza!” occurs 15 times throughout the novel. Literally, it means “patience” and can be translated to the English phrases “oh well,” as Hooper and Kraczyna do, or “too bad”—although in Geoffrey Brock’s translation for The New York Review of Books, it sometimes becomes “don’t worry” or “oh all right.” It’s a quintessentially Italian admission of defeat, conveying frustration and acceptance in equal parts—an acknowledgment of one’s powerlessness that, as Hooper and Kraczyna note, “echoes centuries of unwilling yet unavoidable resignation.”</p><p>In other words, Pinocchio harbors a strain of systemic injustice and deep betrayal. That has a lot to do with the historical context in which it was written: two decades after Italy’s unification.</p><p>At the time, many of the intellectuals who had mobilized during the so-called Risorgimento—the decades-long process by which Italy became a nation, following a wave of failed revolutions and wars of independence—felt betrayed by the direction that the newly founded nation had taken. One of them was Collodi. Born Carlo Lorenzini in 1826, in what was then the Grand Duchy of Tuscany (Collodi was a pen name, after the Tuscan village of his maternal family), he started editing a satirical newspaper, Il Lampione, in 1848. Soon, he garnered recognition as a voice of the most progressive side of the Risorgimento—one that hoped to build an egalitarian and democratic nation. As a political commentator, Collodi stood out for his republican stances: “Trusting in a king, we took up arms and lost; let’s take up arms again, trusting in the people, and we shall win.” He was also a wry aphorist: “The habit makes the person. Take black suits away, and you’ll no longer find a single serious man on the face of earth,” he once wrote.</p><p>[Read: Disney+’s Pinocchio is a zombie]</p><p>Collodi fought in Italy’s first two independence wars, in 1848 and 1859. However, by the time the country actually became an independent, unified state in 1861, the pro-democracy camp that he represented had been sidelined; Italy had become a monarchy where only a few people had the right to vote while the majority-illiterate and wretchedly poor population was kept at the margins. Disaffected, Collodi became a bold critic of the nation he’d helped found. He wrote a famous invective against the government’s decision to make early education compulsory, objecting not to the idea of educating the poor but to the hypocrisy of expecting starving families to send their children to school when they could not even feed them. “Man needs, first and foremost, to have food, water and a shelter,” he wrote in an 1877 open letter titled “Bread and Books.” “Only then he can be in the state of mind of listening to his conscience and feel the ambition of improving himself.” Proving Collodi’s point, the law remained largely unapplied, and severe poverty remained rampant in Italy’s poorer regions well up to the 1950s, forcing families to send their children to work in order to put food on the table.</p><p>Pinocchio is, incidentally, the tale of a hungry child who cuts school. Readers acquainted with Collodi’s earlier writings might be tempted to think that the author was approving the choice as both inevitable and an act of rebellion against hypocritical authorities. The novel, as Sinibaldi puts it, can be read as a “denunciation of bourgeois social policies.”</p><p>But Alberto Asor Rosa, a literary critic and staunch Marxist who has enjoyed a legendary status in Italy, offered a more nuanced interpretation. In his seminal 1975 essay, “Le Voci di un’Italia Bambina,” Rosa suggested that Pinocchio’s central political theme was, in fact, the acceptance rather than the rejection of the compromises that go with nation-building: “It’s a universal tale, destined to repeat itself for every person and for every nation. There always comes a moment in which individuals or communities become more adult than they used to be and, looking back, mourn the time when they could be puppets, i.e. do what they pleased.” According to Rosa, Collodi’s greatness lay in his understanding that coming of age, both privately and politically, entails a loss: “Growing up means gaining something but losing something else: A puppet has riches that a boy could never have.”</p><p>Taking Rosa’s reasoning a step further, we can read Pinocchio’s arc as a defeated idealist’s acknowledgment that his vision failed and that the only thing to do is have pazienza—perhaps this is the way things are meant to be. If being a puppet represents uncontrolled rebelliousness, and becoming a real boy—actually “un ragazzino perbene,” a well-behaved kid, in Collodi’s words—means submitting to the social order of a modern nation, with all its hypocrisies and injustices, this would explain the bittersweet, slightly nostalgic tone of the novel’s conclusion: “How funny I was when I was a puppet! And how happy I am now to have become a good little kid!”</p>",

They must average 28,400 tickets sold for the 10 remaining dates to reach 2.6 million for the season. The last time the Cubs announced fewer than 2.6 million tickets sold in a full-capacity season (2020 and 2021 excluded) was 1997.\n\nTHESE RECORDS ARE NOT GOOD: The Cubs have played in 78 games decided by two or fewer runs, tied with the Pirates for the most such games in MLB. The Cubs fell to 39-20 when outhitting their opponent and 16-15 when recording at least 11 hits, and they are 6-40 when scoring two or fewer runs this season.\n\nMCKINSTRY NOTE: Zach McKinstry, out of the leadoff spot this year after his four-hit game Sunday: .281/.343/.438, two doubles, a triple. Small sample size caveat: This represents only 36 plate appearances.\n\nSOME SPLITS: Cubs vs. NL West and AL: 15-37. Cubs vs. NL East and Central: 43-45. Cubs in day games: 27-29. Cubs in night games: 31-53. Cubs in one-run games: 19-25. Cubs in extra-inning games: 7-12.\n\n<p>Here are today’s particulars.</p>\n<p>Cubs lineup:</p>\n\n\n<p>Here is tonight's #Cubs starting lineup in New York. pic.twitter.com/7FYxdShsT0</p>— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) September 12, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Mets lineup: </p>\n\n\n<p>Home sweet home.   #LGM : Chicago (NL) : @C_Bass419 : @CitiField : 7:10 p.m. : @SNYtv : @wcbs880 : https://t.co/c7shjvGVvh pic.twitter.com/NLvSSKVbwc</p>— New York Mets (@Mets) September 12, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Also of interest for tonight and this series (time listed is ET):</p>\n\n\n<p>Umpires for #Cubs (58-82) at #Mets (89-52):Tom Hallion, Phil Cuzzi, Cory Blaser, Mark Ripperger (base assignments not confirmed until first pitch)First Pitch: 7:10 pmVenue: Citi Field</p>— Umpire Crew (@UmpCrew) September 12, 2022\n\n\n\nJavier Assad, RHP vs. Chris Bassitt, RHP\n  \n        \n      Larry Kave/Myrtle Beach Pelicans\n  \n\n  \n        \n      USA TODAY NETWORK\n  \n\n<p>Javier Assad has been pretty effective in his four MLB appearances (three starts). His walk rate is still a bit too high, but in general he’s getting MLB hitters out. As you can see by the graphic below, he’s got six different pitches and mixes them up well.</p>\n<p>He’s obviously never faced the Mets or anyone on their active roster, so perhaps that will be to his advantage tonight.</p>\n<p>Chris Bassitt was acquired by the Mets in the A’s selloff that happened before this season began, and he’s been quite effective for them this year, basically replicating the All-Star season he had in Oakland in 2021.</p>\n<p>In 11 starts since July 1: 2.26 ERA, 1.116 WHIP, only two HR in 71⅔ innings. </p>\n<p>He has one career start vs. the Cubs, August 5, 2019 at Wrigley Field.

        "description": "<p>Jonathan Bernstein: “Back when things were going badly, pressure began building on Biden to do something to turn his administration around. When an administration is perceived to be in trouble, often the first change presidents make is to bring on a new chief of staff. And sure enough, in late January the Washington Post reported that Chief of Staff Ron Klain’s job was in trouble. At that point, the poorly regarded U.S. evacuation from Afghanistan was still fresh in people’s minds. Meanwhile, inflation was building, and the big Build Back Better spending package (the one that eventually became the climate and health bill) was repeatedly pronounced dead.”</p>\n<p>“Biden, to his credit, did not do something. He presumably knew that the case against Klain was weak and that his administration was reasonably well-organized and well-run. So he kept Klain on. It appears to have been the right decision.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>Federico Viticci is back again with his 8th annual review of Apple’s primary OS, this time covering iOS 16 in 15 pages on MacStories.net.</p>\n<p>In particular, I wanted to highlight Part 7, which deals with Shortcuts:</p>\n<p>\n  In iOS 16, the Shortcuts app hasn’t undergone a major redesign or technical rewrite; instead, Apple’s efforts have focused on adding more actions for system apps, extending the developer API, bringing more stability, and making Shortcuts more approachable for new users.</p>\n<p>  The last point is both important and likely the reason why some Shortcuts power users will be disappointed by this year’s update. There isn’t a lot for them in this new version of the app: as we’ll see in my iPadOS review, there’s no integration with Files quick actions, no support for Stage Manager actions, and no system-wide hotkeys still. If you’re an advanced Shortcuts user and were wishing for more system-level enhancements in addition to stability this year: I hear you, but we’ll talk about this later on.</p>\n<p>  What we do have in iOS 16 is a fascinating new feature to get newcomers started with the Shortcuts app, a grab bag of useful new actions for Apple apps, and some solid developer-related enhancements that will make third-party actions much better than before. Let’s take a look.\n</p>\n<p>In the three pages dedicated to everything Shortcuts, Federico covers App Shortcuts, new actions, and other Shortcuts improvements.</p>\n<p>I agree with most everything Federico covered, although I do suspect App Shortcuts still prove useful to power users like him and I rather than mostly aimed at new users (as he posited) — it’s nice to not have to set up basic shortcuts for my apps, and I can focus my custom shortcuts on only the more advanced use cases instead.</p>\n<p>Read the whole iOS 16 review on MacStories.</p>\n<p>The post Shortcuts in the iOS 16 MacStories Review appeared first on Matthew Cassinelli.</p>",

        "description": "<p>U.S. firms are increasingly second-guessing their exposure in China and Taiwan for various reasons. Tensions over Taiwan remain elevated after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent visit, with military exercises on both sides of the Taiwan Strait inching toward live-fire shooting. Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s zero COVID policy continues to cause unexpected and disruptive factory shutdowns, and new U.S. restrictions on imports made with Chinese Uyghur forced labor threatens billions of dollars of U.S. companies’ revenues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For businesses, the COVID shutdowns and new forced labor laws may be the more immediate concerns, but they can find the most efficient path to deal with new rules and regulations. In the event of a crisis in the Taiwan Strait, however, two immediate risks to the overall U.S. economy stand out: disruptions to container shipments and digital flows. New evidence sheds light on how and why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Various wargaming scenarios have surely played out behind closed doors in Beijing, Taipei and Washington. But public information on how a Chinese takeover of Taiwan would unfold and how the island state might be vulnerable has been scant. Only a few hints have reached the light of day, like a Center for a New American Security study and a recent Center for Strategic and International Studies effort. Those analyses largely focus on military strategies and outcomes rather than economic effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent data revealed by open-source intelligence methods, as detailed in our new Mercatus Center study, indicate that a malicious cyber threat actor in China is targeting Taiwanese ports and undersea data cable landing stations. This is not necessarily surprising but does underscore the immediate risks to the U.S. economy, with its broad and deep exposure to and reliance on the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The data set is gleaned from an unsecured Chinese website by New Kite Data Labs, an open-source data collector, and contains 294,100 points of interest (POIs) in Taiwan, suggestive of China’s military planning. These points cover hundreds of transportation facilities like seaports and train stations, and more than 2,000 government facilities, including close to 200 military facilities and Taiwan’s equivalent of the Central Intelligence Agency. Also included are hundreds of locations related to information and communication technology, such as telecommunication facilities and submarine cable landing stations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interferences with container shipments in the Taiwan Strait and nearby waters are relatively straightforward, but disruptions to the island’s digital infrastructure are often overlooked. That’s a mistake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taiwan is a critical link in global value chains, in no small part due to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s leader in semiconductor chip fabrication. Much of that value creation depends on the island’s connection to the global internet, which is nearly entirely supported by hundreds of cables lining the ocean floor. That data network is vulnerable everywhere, including in Taiwan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in peacetime, undersea cables are vulnerable to accidental damage from, for example, collisions with ship anchors, shark bites and earthquake damage. An entire country can be taken offline for days when an undersea cable is severed. When the cables reach shore, they are connected to landing stations not always discernable from other small buildings. While repairing a cable or landing station is straightforward, doing so with rockets flying would be slow and dangerous, if not impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's hard to estimate the damage to the global economy if Taiwan is off-grid for an extended period of time. U.S. tech firms are heavily reliant on Taiwan for advanced computer chips. The cost to U.S. industries would easily multiply if companies were compelled to take more expensive actions than waiting for the connection to come back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beijing’s ambitions for taking over the island are serious and practical. Washington should work closely with its allies in the region to harden submarine cable security and sketch out contingency plans for severe disruptions to goods and digital trade. Increased cooperation is the only way to strengthen Indo-Pacific resilience against Chinese aggressions and minimize collateral damage to the U.S. economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christine McDaniel is a senior research fellow with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and former deputy assistant secretary at the Treasury Department. Weifeng Zhong is a Mercatus senior research fellow and a core developer of the open-sourced Policy Change Index project, which uses machine-learning algorithms to predict authoritarian regimes’ major policy moves. They are coauthors of a new study, “Submarine Cables and Container Shipments: Two Immediate Risks to the US Economy if China Invades Taiwan.”</p>",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlaska Airlines’ dress code likely violates state law, the Human Rights Commission of Washington state, where the airline is headquartered, said Monday in a reasonable cause finding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and its Washington state affiliate last year sent a letter to the airline on behalf of a nonbinary flight attendant asking Alaska Airlines to stop enforcing its stringent uniform policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder new uniform guidelines announced in March, certain restrictions have been lifted, but there are some exceptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>An Alaska Airlines policy that requires flight attendants to wear either “masculine” or “feminine” uniforms is likely discriminatory, the Human Rights Commission of Washington state, where the airline is headquartered, said Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the commission, Alaska Airlines had forced employees including Justin Wetherell, a nonbinary flight attendant, that identify as neither male nor female to fit into a “binary uniform system,” likely violating a Washington state law that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity, appearance, behavior or expression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A “preponderance of evidence” supports a claim made by Wetherell in 2021 that the airline had discriminated against them, the commission wrote Monday in a reasonable cause finding, noting that the stringent uniform policy violates a state law barring employers from “requiring an individual to dress or groom in a manner that is not consistent with that individual’s gender expression or gender identity.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alaska Airlines in March announced updates to its uniform policy, which had previously required flight attendants to adhere to a rigid set of “male” and “female” dress and grooming standards.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>America is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Under the airline’s new uniform guidelines, restrictions on fingernail polish, tattoos and piercings have been relaxed and “male” and “female” uniform kits have been renamed to “masculine” and “feminine” kits to be inclusive of all gender identities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some exceptions to the new policy, and flight attendants with facial hair, for instance, may not wear pieces from the “feminine” kit, no matter their gender identity. Details related to dress or grooming standards for a promised gender-neutral uniform kit have not been released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wetherell argued – and the state Human Rights Commission agreed – that the airline’s updated dress code is still discriminatory because employees like Wetherell are only able to wear the “masculine” look because they have facial hair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The illegal and discriminatory uniform policy maintained by Alaska Airlines forces employees like me to dress and groom in a manner inconsistent with our gender identities and gender expressions,” Wetherell said Monday in a statement released by their attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There is no reason for the airline to continue to enforce this illegal policy – other than to maintain an outdated and discriminatory ideal of gender,” they said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ACLU and its Washington state affiliate in a letter sent to Alaska Airlines last year on Wetherell’s behalf urged the airline to abandon its previous dress code, which the groups said was inconsistent with state and federal law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These rigid, binary uniform requirements are more than a mere inconvenience,” they wrote in the letter. “By forcing our client and countless other employees to adhere to Alaska Airlines’ preferred vision of how men and women should appear, the uniform policy demeans employees who do not conform to gender stereotypes and materially interferes with their ability to do their jobs under equal terms and conditions as other employees.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a response posted to the airline’s website soon after the letter was published, Alaska Airlines said it has been “a longtime supporter of the LGBTQ+ community\" and a “leader in the industry” when it comes to uniform and grooming standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are committed to making Alaska a place where everyone feels respected and belongs and proudly celebrate the diversity of our employees this Pride month and all year long,” the airline wrote, referring to LGBTQ+ Pride Month, celebrated in June.The ACLU on Monday pushed back on that claim, arguing that the airline’s uniform policy reinforces “archaic and harmful gender stereotypes” that affect anyone, regardless of gender identity, that “does not fit Alaska Airlines’ preferred image of either male or female.”</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Denis Poroy/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>LA’s magic number for a 10th straight postseason berth is 1</p> <p>Remember all that on Sunday about the Dodgers clinching a playoff spot? It’s not technically true just yet, though it could be as soon as Monday. Multiple-team tiebreakers threw a wrench into plans.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers won four of seven games against the Brewers this season, which gives them the tiebreaker over Milwaukee should those two teams end up tied for one spot. The Dodgers have 96 wins, and the Brewers have 66 losses, so the only way that could happen is if Los Angeles loses all 23 of its final games, and Milwaukee wins its last 21 games.</p>\n<p>But that fails to account for a true chaos scenario of another team (or multiple other teams) also ending up at 96-66, vying for a spot. </p>\n<p>The Padres can still technically win the National League West, so let’s leave them aside for a moment. </p>\n<p>First, let’s look at the MLB tiebreaker scenarios, with Games 163 no longer in the mix:</p>\n\n\n<p>pic.twitter.com/VvxTJICNFb</p>— MLB Communications (@MLB_PR) April 14, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some scenarios where the Dodgers could still technically be on the outside looking in.</p>\n<p>Let’s say the Brewers win out and tie the Cardinals atop NL Central, the Padres win the NL West, and you have the Cardinals, Brewers, Phillies, and Dodgers somehow all end up tied at 96-66 for the NL Central and the final two wild card spots. Milwaukee would get the division in that scenario by winning the season series over St. Louis. The Brewers are currently 8-7 against the Cardinals, but winning out would ensure four more wins over their division rivals.</p>\n<p>Here are the head-to-head marks in that remaining three-team, wild card jumble:</p>\n<p>Phillies: 8-6 (.571) against the Cardinals and DodgersCardinals: 7-6 (.538) against the Dodgers and PhilliesDodgers: 5-8 (.385) against the Cardinals and Phillies</p>\n<p>With the Dodgers dropping all their remaining regular season games in this scenario, they’d lose all three games to the Cardinals next week at Dodger Stadium. This would give St. Louis a 4-2 season series edge, and also knock the Dodgers out if it came down to a two-team tiebreaker.</p>\n<p>This scenario isn’t realistic, but it’s at least possible. But perhaps a more realistic version is if the Phillies end up 96-66, that requires an 18-4 finish, and it’s likely they pass at least one of Atlanta or New York. Since the Mets would have to lose the three games against Milwaukee in this scenario, and should they get swept by Atlanta in the season’s final weekend, let’s drop New York into the three-team wild card muck:</p>\n<p>Mets: 9-5 (.643) against the Cardinals and DodgersCardinals: 6-7 (.462) against the Dodgers and MetsDodgers: 5-8 (.385) against the Cardinals and Mets</p>\n<p>All this confusion ends, at least as far as the Dodgers are related, with one more win, or a Milwaukee loss, though the Brewers don’t play until Tuesday. That leaves only one chance for the Dodgers to clinch a playoff berth on Monday: a win, which would in fact guarantee them a playoff berth. For real this time. </p>",

        "description": "Photo by Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>It’s over now. But, boy, it was impressive while it lasted.</p> <p>It turns out that the irresistible force of Zac Gallen could not beat the immovable object which is the blasted hell-scape of Coors Field. The fourth inning on Sunday marked the end of Gallen’s scoreless streak, terminating at a franchise record of 44.1 innings. It’s the seventh longest in major-league history, and the longest since future Diamondback Zack Greinke reached 45.2 innings in 2015. In honor of the new Diamondbacks record, let’s take a look back at each of the seven games which combined for the historic run.</p>\nAugust 8, vs. Pirates: 7 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 2 BB, 8 SO\n\n<p>Gallen held Pittsburgh to three hits, all of them singles, over seven innings to get the streak under way. The Pirates only had one at-bat with a runner in scoring position, and that came to Zac’s final hitter of the game, with two outs in the seventh. He got a ground-out to end the threat, and the Diamondbacks held on to win 3-0. Everything in his arsenal was working for Gallen: “I’d say that was one of the few times this year I had them all working, all kind of repeatable and able to make the adjustments when I need to. It just kind of makes the strike zone that much bigger.”</p>\nAugust 13, @ Rockies: 7 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 6 SO\n\n<p>Only about one in ten 2022 starters has managed to pitch in Coors without allowing a run, but that included Zac here . Indeed, he did not allow a man past first the entire night, facing just two batters over the minimum. Zac needed only 89 pitches to get through his seven innings, and Arizona led from the second batter in, winning 6-0. Torey Lovullo was at Nicole Hazen’s celebration of life, but acting manager Jeff Bannister said of Gallen, “His changeup played big tonight. He was able to move the fastball in and out, keep hitters off-balance both east and west. … As [the Rockies] were sitting soft, he was able to put some guys away with the fastball. He had enough high fastballs to allow that breaking ball to play.”</p>\nAugust 18 @ Giants: 7.1 IP, 4 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 12 SO\n\n<p>This was uncharted territory for Zac, as he recorded an eighth inning out for the first time in his career, and has a career-high 12 Ks. Gallen took a perfect game into the seventh inning, before Joc Pederson broke it up with a two-out single. The inning ended when Brandon Belt tried to bunt with two strikes, such was Gallen’s dominance. The lead-off batter in the eighth reached second on an error, but Gallen and Noe Ramirez combined to strand them there and keep the streak alive. After the game, won 5-0 by the D-backs, Zac said,  “I just feel like I was ahead early and then I felt like I was just able to put them away in one or two pitches, pretty much limit the pitch count.”</p>\nAugust 24 @ Royals: 6 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 3 BB, 6 SO\n\n<p>Gallen wasn’t able to get the W here, as a five-run seventh off the Arizona bullpen sent the D-backs to a 5-3 loss. The streak also came within a hair of ending, M.J. Melendez being thrown out at home by a very narrow margin to end the third inning. However, Zac regrouped, working through more traffic than was customary for him, to leave the game with a 1-0 lead, before the D-backs’ relievers... It seems this is when Gallen noticed: “I just felt like I was trying to worry about (the shutout streak), It’s one of those things where if you let it get too big and control you too much it can be a problem. I felt like that in the first couple innings... I just need to do my job and not worry about it.”</p>\nAugust 30, vs Phillies: 7 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 7 SO\n\n<p>Zac came back to Chase Field for his first start there in over three weeks, and picked up his 10th win of the season. He got plenty of help from the offense, a five-run second inning getting Arizona on their way to a 12-3 victory, even this bullpen couldn’t blow. Once more, Gallen did not allow a runner past first-base, and with the aid of a pair of double-plays, saw only one hitter over the minimum, despite facing the toughest line-up of the streak to date. Zac admitted he didn’t feel at his best: “To be honest, I didn’t feel super-comfortable first, maybe second time through the line-up... The offense gave me a big enough lead I could convince myself to just be in the zone.”</p>\nSeptember 4. vs. Brewers: 7 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 7 SO\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Gallen won the NL Pitcher of the Month award for August, having gone 5-0 with a 0.68 ERA. The calendar page turned, but Zac kept right on going, the streak reaching historic levels. Gallen - and stop me if you’ve heard this before - again did not allow a runner past first, and finished strong, retiring the last 11 Milwaukee hitters to come to the plate against him. Arizona won 5-1, though a 5-star grab from Daulton Varsho likely saved the streak, drawing praise from the pitcher: “Varsho made an unbelievable play. Honestly, I was like, ‘Oh man, there it goes, unless it bounces over the fence for a ground-rule double.’... If he’s not the best right fielder defensively in baseball, he’s definitely up there.”</p>\nAugust 11, @ Rockies: 6 IP, 4 H, 3 R, 3 ER, 0 BB, 11 SO\n\n<p>All good things must come to an end, and such is the case with Gallen’s streak. He was perfect through the first three innings, fanning six of nine. But Zac got a bit BABIP’d in the fourth, a trio of singles scoring a run. The odd of all three becoming hits was just 8.4%, per xBA. Gallen recovered to get the win, striking out 11 over six innings, and sounded not unhappy the building pressure was finally off, after 441⁄3 scoreless innings. “I’m glad it’s over in the sense that it’s a relief. I’m not going to have to worry about trying to be so perfect out there. But at the same time, it’s one of those things that you may never get a shot at again. Ultimately, it was a good run.”</p>\n\n<p>I think “a good run” is likely underselling it. This is all but certain to be another sub-.500 season for the D-backs, but underwhelming campaigns can still provide reasons to cheer. 2004 gave us Randy Johnson’s perfect game. 2021 included Tyler Gilbert’s no-hitter. And this season will always be remembered for Zac Gallen’s remarkable run of shutout baseball, which not only warmed our hearts, it gave Arizona’s fans justifiable reason to look forward to more from him in the future. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Rockies rookie Elehuris Montero is an aggressive hitter, there can be no denying that.</p>\n<p>In the fourth inning of the Rockies’ 12-6 loss to Arizona on Sunday, he ambushed Zac Gallen’s first-pitch cutter, driving it into right-center field for a two-run double.</p>\n<p>Considering how well Gallen has pitched this season, Montero’s aggressive plan of attack made sense. Gallen, after all, is 12-2 with a 2.50 ERA, and his 0.908 WHIP and 5.9 hits allowed per nine are the best in the National League.</p>\n<p>“To do what he did against Gallen, arguably one of the best pitchers presently in the game, driving the ball to right-center on a cutter, is a good sign,” manager Bud Black said. “And it’s a positive that he can take (from that game).”</p>\n<p>A number of Rockies players have made their big-league debuts this season, including first baseman/right fielder Michael Toglia and catcher Brian Serven. It’s Montero, however, who’s had the biggest impact. Standing 6-foot-3 and weighing 235 pounds, Montero is “country strong,” as Black put it.</p>\n<p>Entering Tuesday night’s game in Chicago against the White Sox, Montero is hitting .257 (35-for-136) with five home runs, 14 doubles and 17 RBIs. He’s played in 41 games since his May 1 debut, starting 15 games at third base, 11 at first base and 10 as the designated hitter.</p>\n<p>He remains a work in progress in the field, as a sloppy throwing error from third base in the fourth inning of Sunday’s game illustrated.</p>\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies’ Ryan McMahon homers again, but seeks consistency\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies’ four-game winning streak ends with ugly loss to D-backs\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tProgressive catching guru Jerry Weinstein one of Rockies’ hidden treasures: “He’s a hard (blank), but in the very best way”\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tC.J.

His 32.9% strikeout rate vs. a 4.2% walk rate, plus his .294 on-base percentage, are numbers that reveal a work in progress.</p>\n<p>Montero’s at-bat in the eighth inning Sunday against Arizona All-Star lefty Joe Mantiply illustrated how far Montero has to go. From the outset, Mantiply had Montero fishing at off-speed pitches, ultimately whiffing him on a 3-2 bender.</p>\n<p>“Mantiply’s an All-Star with good secondary stuff — a slider and a change, down below the zone,” Black said. “That’s the thing that ‘Monty’ needs to work on. He’s had a tendency to swing at the low, soft pitch. That’s where the challenge is moving forward. But he’ll get there.”</p>\n\nOn Deck\nColorado Rockies’ Chad Kuhl pitches against Milwaukee Brewers’ Willy Adames during the second inning of a baseball game Sunday, July 24, 2022, in Milwaukee.

In his last start, the Rockies rallied for a 10-7, 10-inning victory over Milwaukee, but the right-hander gave up five runs on six hits in 4 1/3 innings, including a 499-foot homer to Christian Yelich. Since his complete-game shutout of the Dodgers at Coors Field on June 27, Kuhl is 1-4 in nine starts, posting a 9.08 ERA, allowing 15 home runs over that span for an average of 3.40 home runs per nine innings. Kuhl has never pitched against the White Sox.</p>\n<p>Kopech, who was on the 15-day injured list from Aug. 23 to Sept. 7 with a left knee strain, will make his 25th start of the season. He’s winless in his last six starts, going 0-3 with a 5.88\nERA, but he had 24 strikeouts over that span while holding hitters to a .221 batting average. He got a victory in Chicago’s 2-1 win over the Rockies on July 26 at Coors Field, pitching 5 1/3 scoreless innings, giving up six hits, walking three, and striking out four. That’s the only time he’s faced the Rockies.</p>\n<p>Trending: C.J. Cron has an RBI in four straight games and 10 total RBIs through his last eight games.

        "description": "Photo by Michael Urakami/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Two Mets regulars are back.</p> <p>Ahead of their series opener against the Cubs at Citi Field tonight, the Mets have reinstated right-handed pitcher Trevor May and infielder extraordinaire Luis Guillorme from the injured list. To make room for them on the 28-man active roster, the team designated infielder Deven Marrero for assignment and placed right-handed Bryce Montes de Oca on the injured list with left hamstring tightness.</p>\n<p>Before hitting the injured list, Guillorme was fantastic, playing excellent defense at multiple positions in the infield while hitting .283/.355/.357 with a 109 wRC+ in 289 plate appearances. In the games that preceded his injury, he had settled into a platoon with the now-hot Eduardo Escobar at third base.</p>\n<p>May struggled mightily earlier in the season and missed a long stretch of time after hitting the injured list with an arm issue back in early May. He returned to the mound for the Mets on August 3 and has a 3.86 ERA and 3.87 FIP in 9.1 innings since then. He last appeared on in a game on September 1, during which he threw a scoreless inning against the Dodgers. He went on the injured list two days later because of COVID.</p>\n<p>Montes de Oca was called up to take May’s spot on the active roster at that time, and he threw 3.1 innings with a 10.80 ERA and 1.32 FIP before hitting the IL himself today. Marrero only got six plate appearances with the Mets and failed to reach base.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Megan Briggs/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Miami, FL—Rise and shine! It’s doubleheader day!</p>\n<p>Following back-to-back blowouts at the hands of the New York Mets, the Marlins welcomed the Texas Rangers back to town. </p>\n<p>Three games between the clubs were originally scheduled to be played in April, but those were postponed due to the lockout. The first of the three was played immediately following the All-Star break, and for some, that game is seen as a turning point in the Marlins’ season when things started to look bleak. (It happened to be the game Miguel Rojas sustained a wrist injury that he is still dealing with this late in the season and will most likely require surgery in the offseason.) </p>\n<p>A split doubleheader on Monday accommodated the other two games.</p>\n<p>Prior to the first game, the Marlins made the following roster moves:</p>\n\nRecalled RHP Bryan Hoeing from AAA Jacksonville as the 29th man for the doubleheader.\nOptioned LHP Andrew Nardi to AAA Jacksonville.\nSelected the contract of RHP Aneurys Zabala from AAA Jacksonville.\n\n<p>With Braxton Garrett announced as the starter for game 2, another corresponding move will be required. But that’s a topic for the author of the game 2 recap. My job is to recap the first game. So let’s do that. </p>\n<p>Trevor Rogers began the game strong, striking out the first batter and working around a two-out single by Nathaniel Lowe to retire the side on just eleven pitches. He struck out three more in the second inning, with a walk to Sam Huff sandwiched in between. In the third inning, he set down the side in order, tallying another strikeout to bring his total to five. He retired the side in the fourth inning in order, tacking on an additional two punchouts. He had recorded seven strikeouts through four innings on 53 pitches. Two more strikeouts in the fifth brought his total to nine. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Trevor would come back out to the mound with the lead after the Marlins offense capitalized on multiple mistakes by Rangers pitcher Glenn Otto. The bottom of the fifth began with Miguel Rojas getting hit by a pitch and advancing to second on a pickoff attempt that drilled him in the back. Stallings walked, and they both advanced into scoring position on a wild pitch. Lewin Díaz hit a sacrifice fly to center field that scored Miggy from third and moved Jacob to third. Note the lack of a hit being recorded in the inning. Jon Berti would fix that by lining a ball into left field for an RBI single to give the Marlins a 2-0 lead. </p>\n<p>Trevor got some help from third baseman Brian Anderson, who made two slick plays in the top of the sixth—he got the first out across the diamond and started a 5-6-3 double play from the right side of the infield to end the inning. </p>\n<p>The Fish threatened to score more in the sixth but could not push a run across, stranding runners on the corners. And in the top of the seventh, Trevor ran into trouble. </p>\n<p>He got Nathaniel Lowe to fly out to left for the first out. Then Adolis García started the trouble with a one-out double and was followed by Mark Mathias, who drew a full count walk. Josh Jung then hit a long fly ball to deep center that should’ve been caught by JJ Bleday—and almost was—but he mistimed the jump, and the ball deflected off his glove. A run would score and make it 2-1. </p>\n\n\n<p>Tough play for Bleday, but this ball needs to be caught. Rangers are now in a nice position to take the lead. #Marlins pic.twitter.com/6KTjWibgwq</p>— Isaac Azout (@IsaacAzout) September 12, 2022\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Tommy Nance came into the game and the next batter grounded out to shortstop Miguel Rojas deep in the hole at short, just deep enough to score another run and tie the game. </p>\n<p>Trevor’s final line: 6.1 IP, 4 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 2 BB, 9 K, 89/60 P/S.</p>\n<p>The offense was retired in order in the bottom of the seventh, and Steven Okert came on to pitch the eighth. He retired the first two batters and allowed a walk, an infield hit, and another walk to load the bases. On the 3-2 pitch of the following at-bat, a pitch that caught the edge of the zone was called ball four by home plate umpire John Libka, and the Rangers took the lead 3-2. Jeff Brigham took over on the mound and struck out Josh Jung to end the inning. </p>\n<p>Miami’s offense was again unable to push across a run in the eighth, Jeff Brigham pitched a scoreless ninth, and the Marlins went down in order in the bottom half to end the game. Another one-run loss.</p>\n<p>After the game, Manager Don Mattingly said that today was some of the best he's seen from Trevor in his entire career. It was all for naught as the game went the opponent's way. </p>\n\n\n<p>\"Of course I'm not gonna quit.\"Some deep introspection and self-analysis from Trevor Rogers, as he discusses challenging himself amid struggles and how he got back to a good place on the mound. #MakeItMiami pic.twitter.com/kUMQmHIiDc</p>— Bally Sports Florida: Marlins (@BallyMarlins) September 12, 2022\n\n\n\n<p></p>\nNoah’s Notes and What’s Next\n\nBrian Anderson has been hitting the ball very well.\nEvery batter in the Marlins' starting lineup reached base at least once. \nGame 2 is at 7:10 PM.\nI have a wedding to be at. \nScratch that.

        "description": "<p>Jonathan Bernstein: “Back when things were going badly, pressure began building on Biden to do something to turn his administration around. When an administration is perceived to be in trouble, often the first change presidents make is to bring on a new chief of staff. And sure enough, in late January the Washington Post reported that Chief of Staff Ron Klain’s job was in trouble. At that point, the poorly regarded U.S. evacuation from Afghanistan was still fresh in people’s minds. Meanwhile, inflation was building, and the big Build Back Better spending package (the one that eventually became the climate and health bill) was repeatedly pronounced dead.”</p>\n<p>“Biden, to his credit, did not do something. He presumably knew that the case against Klain was weak and that his administration was reasonably well-organized and well-run. So he kept Klain on. It appears to have been the right decision.”</p>",

(credit: Samuel Axon)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Apple released the next major versions of several of its operating systems today, including watchOS 9, tvOS 16, and iOS 16. The latter is probably the most significant of the three, with a total overhaul of the iPhone lock screen, new iMessage editing and message deletion capabilities, and passkeys that attempt to replace passwords (our full iOS 16 review is forthcoming).</p>\n\n<p>Also of note are a volley of updates for older operating systems, including iOS 15.7, iPadOS 15.7, and macOS Monterey 12.6. The iPad and macOS updates both bring the security-related patches from the newer OS versions back to older ones while we wait for the release of iPadOS 16.1 and macOS Ventura later in the fall. The release of iOS 15.7 serves two purposes: to keep older iPhones that can't run iOS 16 updated with security patches (this includes the iPhone 6S and iPhone 7 series along with the original iPhone SE, among others) and to give people who don't want to upgrade to iOS 16 a way to get security updates.</p>\n<p>Apple also did this for a few months after the release of iOS 15, offering version 14.8 to supported devices so that people could defer the update without putting themselves at risk. By January 2022, the company stopped updating iOS 14 and pushed all iOS users to update to version 15.2.1.</p><p>Read 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

As we've seen quite a few Atari-branded collections over the years, we wondered exactly what shape Atari 50's selection of \"over 100 games\" would take ahead of its launch on Steam, Xbox One, PS4, and Nintendo Switch on November 8.</p>\n<p>Thanks to a European retailer listing that emerged over the weekend, we now have an apparently final list of the Atari 50 selection of games: 103 in all, as spread across arcade cabinets, six console families, and a selection of \"reimagined,\" newly coded games and ports. The verdict: It's pretty good, yet it's still a glaring reminder that the compilation might better be named \"Atari Corp. 50.\"</p>\nMissing vowels and details about Vctr Sctr (for now)\n<p>We'll break this article up into platform-specific lists, which each include our own notes and analysis, and we'll start with the least-surprising list.

        "description": "<p>Wildfires gripping the Pacific Northwest are making the air far less breathable across the U.S. West, as windy weather transports hazardous particles and haze over multiple state lines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First responders were working on 16 large fires throughout the Pacific Northwest on Monday, with smoke conditions persisting throughout the region, according to the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center — a logistical hub for the region’s federal and state woodland fire agencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>About a third of the major active fires across the West are in Idaho, while the greatest total burned acreage is in Oregon, the National Interagency Fire Center said. Montana, Washington state, Utah, Wyoming and California also have large active fires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pacific Northwest was already contending with widespread air quality issues following a smoky weekend, though now areas far away from the rolling conflagrations are facing deteriorating air conditions as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It's something that the people who live here have kind of gotten used to, but I think their health is affected by it,” Bob Yokelson, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Montana, told The Hill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our activities are curtailed somewhat because of it,” added Yokelson, who is based in Missoula. “So soccer practice and outdoor events and things like that sometimes get cancelled or moved indoors at the last minute.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yokelson’s region of Montana, located just east of the Idaho panhandle, has been enduring an influx of smoke predominantly from fires raging in Idaho, but also from those in Washington, Oregon and Western Canada.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It's one of the few regions here in the Pacific Northwest where the air hasn't been getting better over the years,” Yokelson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Climate change and past fuel management are making the fires worse,” he continued, noting that Montana is situated downwind from most Northwest wildfire hot spots.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>While Montana is coping with brutal air quality, states from the Midwest to the Mountain West are also bracing for the possible health effects of these fires located hundreds of miles away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such pollution comes from fine particulate matter — known as PM 2.5, or particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 microns — which is prominent in wildfire ash and can cause respiratory health issues.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colorado’s Department of Public Health and Environment issued a smoke outlook on Monday morning, warning “hazy skies and light to moderate concentrations of smoke are possible in northern and western portions of Colorado.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such air quality conditions, according to the agency, would be “due to smoke from out-of-state wildfires.” While no significant public health impacts were expected, the agency advised that sensitive individuals should reduce heavy exertion in areas where smoke is apparent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the much more immediate vicinity of the Pacific Northwest blazes, both Seattle and Portland ranked within the top 20 cities worldwide for air pollution levels on Monday, according to the Swiss air quality monitoring app IQAir.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the weekend, Seattle briefly achieved the most toxic spot on that list, The Seattle Times reported, adding that air pollution levels appeared to be the worst in almost two years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of Idaho’s northern panhandle was experiencing “unhealthy” air quality levels on Monday, according to the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality’s real-time air monitoring system. Two monitoring stations near the Washington-Oregon border showed levels considered “very unhealthy.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unhealthy air quality levels, as defined by the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Air Quality Index, are those that can cause serious health effects for members of sensitive groups. Very unhealthy levels are those come with an increased risk of health effects for everyone, while “hazardous” levels constitute an emergency health warning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huge swaths of Montana, Washington state and Oregon, along with the Sierra Nevada and Western Canada, were likewise exhibiting unhealthy air quality on Monday, with some spots exhibiting very unhealthy or even hazardous conditions, according to the EPA's interactive AirNow air quality map.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yokelson explained that the full health impact of such conditions on humans is uncertain, as smoke effects can be acute and people experience a lifetime of exposure to pollution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The smoke is spreading great distances due to a high-pressure weather system that has set in over the Great Basin — the watershed that includes most of Nevada and parts of surrounding states — Frank Flocke, an atmospheric chemist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told The Hill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s High-Resolution Rapid Refresh forecast map for “near surface smoke” showed a spinning system on Monday that could move over the next day down through Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and as far south as Denver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such systems, which are common in the summer, cause the air to rotate clockwise and can pick up smoke from California, Oregon and Idaho and carry it down to distant states like Colorado, Flocke said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The red plume is going over Cheyenne and then coming to Denver,” said Flocke, who is based in Boulder, Colo. “It’ll probably get pretty bad by tomorrow.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the Pacific Northwest blazes feeding this system is central Oregon’s Cedar Creek Fire, which grew to 86,734 acres on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Cedar Creek Fire has been burning in the wilderness for a month, only on Friday morning did the blaze begin to encroach upon communities, according to the office of Gov. Kate Brown (D), who in response invoked the Emergency Conflagration Act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But containment of the Cedar Creek Fire plunged to zero percent on Sunday, after strong easterly winds and dry fuel conditions caused the blaze to grow significantly, Oregon’s Office of the State Fire Marshal reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another blaze in northeastern Oregon, the Double Creek Fire, burned 155,297 acres in the Wallowa National Forest as of Monday and was 15 percent contained, according to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Washington’s Bolt Creek and Goat Rocks fires also burned 7,660 acres and 2,842 acres, respectively, as of Monday, the agency reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thirty-four large fires were blazing in Idaho, including the Moose Fire, which burned 125,925 acres. The Ross Fork fire scorched 37,233 acres, Kootenai River Complex 19,708 acres, Patrol Point 16,000 acres and Williams Creek Fire 15,773 acres, the National Wildfire Coordinating Group reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While high-pressure weather systems over the Great Basin are regular occurrences of summer, the sources of the smoke — Western wildfires — have increased in intensity in recent years, according to Flocke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There are more fires now outside of what was traditionally considered the fire season,” he said, noting that such a shift could potentially be attributed to climate change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Now we’re getting more smoke and more often and for longer periods of time because there are more fires and the fire season is extended and is getting more intense,” Flocke added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yokelson echoed those sentiments, noting the Pacific Northwest’s forests “evolved with a previous climate that was cooler and wetter.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And now that our climate is getting hotter and drier, the forests of the Pacific Northwest may not be the perfectly adapted ecosystem for the new climate anymore,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We're seeing ecosystem change in response to the climate, and the driver of that change — the tool that nature has to get rid of the old ecosystem — is to burn it down.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>The U.S. finds itself in a challenging moment along many dimensions. Political divisions, high prices, supply chain woes, and economic challenges from foreign competitors like China dominate our headlines. Fortunately, despite the pressures for myopic focus on the present, Congress and President Biden recently made a much-needed commitment to our nation’s ability to compete with successful passage of the CHIPS and Science Act. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The major media focus of this legislation is its historic investment in U.S.-based development and production of cutting-edge semiconductors. This focus is understandable, given that semiconductors are a critical sector for economic and national security reasons. But the CHIPS and Science Act does much, much more than that. For example, it creates regional technology hubs that will let under-served regions of the U.S. catch up in innovation and economic growth. It establishes a new technology directorate within the vaunted National Science Foundation, empowered to take novel approaches to research and technology that will help us compete. It sets up a network of microelectronics research centers at our national laboratories. And it supercharges the talent pipeline to help the next generation of scientists and engineers achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For these and other reasons, many advocates and policymakers are taking a well-earned victory lap. But while celebration is merited, it’s also important to understand that the work is not done. Unlike the CHIPs portion of the Act, the Science portion primarily provides authorizations, which are spending targets, and not actual dollars, which require appropriations through annual spending bills. This is the next major step for Congress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Appropriators have made some progress to date in their legislative work. The House Appropriations Committee adopted all twelve of its annual spending bills in June, and six of these were subsequently adopted on the House floor. Senate appropriators have also introduced all twelve of their own bills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the bipartisan win of the CHIPS and Science Act notwithstanding, rancor has erupted along partisan lines over big-picture spending. The end of the fiscal year looms in a matter of weeks, and the midterms follow after that. This means many of the programs created or bolstered by CHIPS and Science will have to wait for full funding, and run the risk of being short-changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, the new technology hubs program mentioned above, so crucial to support researchers and entrepreneurs outside the wealthy cities like Boston or San Francisco, has yet to receive funding in either the House or Senate bills. The National Science Foundation, while likely to receive some increases, may end up receiving billions less than intended in CHIPS and Science, constraining its ability to fully execute the emerging technology vision set forth by Congress. Even smaller initiatives are at risk of under-funding, such as the little-known but important Manufacturing USA, a network of innovation institutes that partner with universities, labs, and small manufacturers to enhance U.S. competitiveness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, CHIPS and Science also authorizes robust multiyear growth for the basic science that underpins game-changing advances. The dramatic rise in public R&amp;D spending in the decades after World War II were the backbone on which the modern U.S. economy was built, bringing broad-based prosperity to our nation. But we have spent the past fifty years retreating from that commitment, with a resultant decline in our role as the worldwide leader in innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CHIPS and Science Act provides a major reversal to this trend. After a careful review of the bill, we estimate that Chips and Science, if fully funded, would raise R&amp;D spending by $75 billion over the next five years, likely representing a more than 10 percent net increase in the federal R&amp;D baseline over that time. This is a major investment that would help boost federal R&amp;D as a share of the U.S. economy and yield far-reaching dividends — but it has to be funded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an unfortunate history of Congress authorizing ambitious boosts for science only to fall short in appropriations. Congress deserves credit for getting the CHIPS and Science Act across the finish line, but legislators shouldn’t rest on their haunches. Instead, our leaders should sustain the moment they’ve started and ensure robust support for federal innovation — our future depends on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ro Khanna has served as the U.S. representative from California's 17th District since 2017.

        "description": "<p>Ukraine’s battleground offensive that has seen it gain thousands of miles of territory once lost to Moscow spells bad news for Russian President Vladimir Putin at home and abroad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ukrainians’ performance has amplified dissent in Russia, has strengthened President Biden’s hand in rallying support for the country, has opened up new opportunities for Kyiv and is expected to make it harder for Russia to find support from its allies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Clearly they’re fighting hard,” a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Monday of the Ukrainian troops, noting that Russian forces have “largely ceded their gains to the Ukrainians” in the vicinity of Kharkiv province, with “many” of the Russian forces moving back over the border into Russia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ukrainian military last week began a counteroffensive that quickly reclaimed territory and pushed Russian troops back to the northeastern border of the country in some places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lightning advance forced thousands of Kremlin troops to make a quick retreat, leaving behind ammunition stockpiles and equipment, reports of abandonment that could be “indicative of Russia’s disorganized command and control,” the defense official said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his forces had recaptured 6,000 square kilometers of land in the east and south of Ukraine since the start of September. Included in the towns reclaimed was Izyum, a key city in the fight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loss of Izyum marks Russia’s worst military defeat since March, when its troops were unable to take the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and were forced back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Ukraine, the rapid advance could be a turning point in the 6-month-old war that moves the fighting out of a battle of attrition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Russia and Putin, it could force some very tough decisions on conscription and the future of a war that Moscow still insists is merely a special military operation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s a time of choosing for President Putin,” said Eric Ueland, the under secretary of State for civilian security, democracy and human rights under former President Trump. “For allies in the West, it’s a time of vigilance, constant communication and clear lines about what would not be acceptable from Russia, especially on the military front, as President Putin and his leadership are continuing to process what’s going on in Ukraine.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting on economic issues via a video link at the Kremlin in Moscow on September 12, 2022. (Photo by Gavriil Grigorov / SPUTNIK / AFP)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heidi Crebo-Rediker, adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted that Putin could react harshly to the increasing momentum from Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“To the extent that there can be any gains made by Ukraine, so much to their credit, I fear now the retaliation that we could see from Putin in the coming days and weeks could be even more brutal against civilians than we've seen already,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an attempt to kneecap Russia and help Ukrainian forces, the United States has been at the forefront of imposing harsh sanctions on Moscow and sending military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine since the war began. To keep Ukraine supplied with a steady stream of weapons, the U.S. since April has led a 50-country effort known as the Ukraine Contact Group to coordinate the flow of military assistance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, U.S. officials announced a new $675 million package of weapons and equipment for Kyiv as well as $2.2 billion in “long-term” military support to bolster the security of Ukraine and 18 nearby countries at risk of any future Russian attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We see how bravely the Ukrainians have been fighting to fight for their freedom and we support that,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday, adding that the White House is “grateful” for the bipartisan support for Ukraine aid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Russia, the retreat has caused problems for Putin beyond the embarrassment of his forces appearing to be caught flat-footed. More than 30 Russian municipal deputies have signed a petition calling for the longtime leader's resignation, a rare criticism of the president who over the years has sought to quash opposition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russian nationalists have also called on Putin to make immediate changes to the Kremlin military campaign, Reuters reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key Putin ally, on Sunday criticized Russia's military for the retreat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They have made mistakes and I think they will draw the necessary conclusions,\" Kadyrov said in a message posted to his Telegram account and translated by The Guardian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin has also faced dissent since Ukraine’s increased counteroffensive from Russian media commentators, which Ueland argued could spark a change in his strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So what does he choose to do if there is a steady erosion of public support for him and Russia? Does that mean he redoubles his efforts in Ukraine? Does that mean that he moves to try to suppress internal dissent? Does that mean he moves to put scapegoats out front for some of the failures here? Nobody knows,” he said. “And it’s very unpredictable.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crebo-Rediker said she was “heartened” by the “small crack in the ice” with the discourse on Russian television over the weekend but said it could lead to more action from Putin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think that the likely path for Putin moving forward is more indiscriminate attacks, more internal televised calls for more mobilization, a potential staged ramp-up or conscription of military recruits from throughout Russia,” she said. “Russia will in some way need to build up its troop levels to take on Ukraine moving forward.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stunning losses for Russia come as Moscow has desperately sought weapons and aid from allies including Iran and North Korea and has played up its support from China. Beijing so far has not publicly provided any help but has refused to condemn the war and has criticized sanctions against Russia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping this week are expected to speak on the sidelines of a regional summit in Uzbekistan, the first time the two will meet face to face since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United States is carefully watching the interaction, as the two countries have become closer partners in recent years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’ve made clear about our concerns about the depth of China’s alignment and ties with Russia, even as Russia prosecutes a war of aggression in Ukraine,” Jean-Pierre said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samar Ali, White House fellow at the Department of Homeland Security under former President Obama, said that if China were to pull support for Russia, it could lead to the withdrawal of support from other Russian allies such as North Korea and Iran.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If we see that China decides that Putin’s not the horse to back right now, obviously I think that’s favorable for the world, for global stability and order,” she said. “So, we'll have to see if China shifts its energy away from Putin, will other countries follow, and will that weaken Putin further and strengthen Ukraine, U.S. and our allies?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crebo-Rediker, however, argued China is unlikely to discredit Putin despite Moscow’s problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don't know if there’s any hope that behind the scenes, China might play at some point a more constructive role than it has to date. But certainly in this upcoming meeting, I don’t imagine that there would be any public display of disunity,” she said.</p>",

        "description": "<p>President Biden on Monday pitched his \"cancer moonshot\" initiative as a bipartisan pursuit that should bring Americans together, comparing it to former President Kennedy’s famous “moonshot” initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Cancer does not discriminate red and blue. It doesn’t care if you’re Republican or a Democrat. Beating cancer is something we can do together, and that’s why I’m here today,” Biden said at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His speech was delivered on the 60th anniversary of Kennedy’s “moonshot” speech at Rice University in Houston, during which he outlined his plan for the U.S. to become an international leader in space exploration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Unwilling to postpone, President Kennedy set a goal to win the space race against Russia and advance science and technology for all of humanity,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Together, we can choose to move forward with unity, hope and optimism. And I believe we can usher in the same unwillingness to postpone, the same national purpose that will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, to end cancer as we know it and even cure cancers once and for all,” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden called the initiative “bold, ambitious” and “completely doable.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initiative, which he relaunched in February, aims to cut the cancer death rate in half over the next 25 years and improve the lives of caregivers and cancer survivors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden announced on Monday the appointment of Renee Wegrzyn as the inaugural director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, an agency created in March focused on developing biomedical technologies to improve health outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, he signed an executive order launching a national biotechnology and biomanufacturing initiative that ensures that advanced biotechnology invented in the U.S. is also manufactured in the U.S.</p>",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n U.S. News and World Report released Monday its 2022-23 “best colleges” ranking.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvard University, Princeton University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were ranked as the top three National Universities.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumbia University’s ranking fell from 2 to 18, after the school used “outdated and/or incorrect methodologies” for its data.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Princeton University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and Stanford University round out the country’s best colleges, according to U.S. News and World Report’s annual rankings.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The media company released its influential report Monday, announcing changes to how it measured academic prestige – in part reflecting the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on student life for the past two years.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s rankings discounted if a school received low SAT and ACT submissions in 2020, “when the supply and demand for taking the [tests] plummeted.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rankings also include a more comprehensive measure of faculty resources and updates that moved 10 percent of schools into different categories. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>America is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\"For nearly 40 years, the Best Colleges methodology has continuously evolved to reflect changes in the higher education landscape and the interests of prospective students,\" said Kim Castro, editor and chief content officer at U.S. News in a statement. \"Guiding that evolution is U.S. News' mission of providing useful data and information to help with one of life's biggest decisions </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In previous years, if a college or university submitted too few SAT or ACT scores from its incoming students, those scores were given less weight in the school’s overall ranking.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this year, for schools reporting SAT and ACT scores for less than 50 percent of its incoming students, U.S. News did not use test scores as part of the criteria for determining the institution’s rank.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, U.S. News placed more weight t high school class standing and average graduation rate. The outlet said adopted the change after many students were unable to attend standardized exams.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. News also included part-time faculty with a terminal degree, or the highest achievable degree in a field, when determining a school’s total percent of faculty with a terminal degree. In prior years, list crafters only used full-time faculty.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>College rankings, like those crafted by U.S. News, have come under scrutiny recently, with Education Secretary Miguel Cardona arguing that institutions’ obsession with chasing the prestige associated with the lists hurts students.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Too often, our best-resourced schools are chasing rankings that mean little on measures that truly count: college completion, economic mobility, narrowing gaps in access to opportunity for ALL Americans,” Cardona said last month. “That system of ranking is a joke!” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February, a Columbia University professor also questioned the school’s “un-matched” rise in rankings from 18th place in 1988 to 2nd place in 2021. In a statement, Professor Michael Thaddeus claimed that “several of the key figures supporting Columbia’s high ranking are inaccurate, dubious, or highly misleading.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The outlet unranked the university from its list released in 2021. Columbia University in June stated that it relied on “outdated and/or incorrect methodologies” in submitting data to U.S. News and World Report.  Columbia University ranked 18th this year.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the top 10 National Universities for 2022-23:  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.

        "description": "<p>The Mets announced a host of roster moves before tonight’s series opener with the Cubs. Luis Guillorme is back from the 10-day injured list, while Trevor May has returned from the COVID-19 list. In corresponding moves, the Mets placed reliever Bryce Montes de Oca on the 15-day IL with left hamstring tightness and designated infielder Deven Marrero for assignment.</p>\n<p>Guillorme returns just under a month after straining his groin. The left-handed hitting utilityman has had a productive season, posting a .283/.355/.357 line across 289 plate appearances. He’s not much of a power threat, but Guillorme puts the ball in play and is capable of playing all around the infield. He’s rated particularly well as a second baseman in his career, but he’s also a viable backup for Francisco Lindor at shortstop and a candidate to take some third base playing time from Eduardo Escobar (although Escobar has been on a tear since being reinstated from his own IL stint a couple weeks back).</p>\n<p>At the very least, Guillorme gives the Mets a high-quality utility infielder. His return left no room for Marrero, who was initially promoted when Guillorme first went down in mid-August. New York quickly outrighted Marrero off the roster but brought him back to the majors not long after. The 32-year-old has been on the roster for the past couple weeks but only gotten into five games, going hitless with three strikeouts in six at-bats.</p>\n<p>It’s familiar territory for Marrero, who was also frequently shuttled on and off the Marlins roster last season. Despite only appearing in 15 MLB games over the last two years, he’s been designated for assignment a staggering eight times since June 2021. He’s cleared outright waivers each time. He’d have the right to refuse a minor league assignment in favor of free agency if he goes unclaimed again, but it seems likely he’d elect to return to Triple-A Syracuse. Marrero has a .217/.309/.325 line over 137 plate appearances there this year.</p>\n<p>Montes de Oca was first promoted on September 3, when May landed on the injured list. He’s made three appearances, allowing four runs in 3 1/3 innings but striking out six. The big right-hander has averaged 95.4 MPH on his cutter and just under triple digits on his sinker, per Statcast, showcasing the impact stuff that allowed him to strike out more than 35% of opponents in 30 Triple-A innings this year. The 26-year-old also walked 15.4% of batters faced at that level, though, and the Mets eased him into the big leagues with low-leverage work.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Diamondbacks announced they’ve designated infielder Wilmer Difo for assignment before tonight’s matchup with the Dodgers. Outfielder Jordan Luplow was recalled to take the vacated active roster spot. The move drops Arizona’s 40-man roster count to 39.</p>\n<p>Signed to a minor league deal over the offseason, the switch-hitting Difo spent most of the season at Triple-A Reno. He struggled to a .269/.311/.398 line through 306 plate appearances there, offense that’s well below average once accounting for Reno’s extreme hitter-friendly nature. Nevertheless, he earned a call-up at the start of this month based on his defensive ability. Difo is capable of covering anywhere on the infield, and he’s rated as a solid shortstop throughout his MLB career.</p>\n<p>The 30-year-old’s stay on the big league club proved rather brief, as he loses his roster spot after appearing in only three games. Difo tallied six plate appearances, going hitless while striking out once. That did mark his eighth straight year with some big league work, and he now owns a .250/.311/.353 line in just over 1300 plate appearances between the Nationals, Pirates and D-Backs.</p>\n<p>Arizona will place Difo on outright or release waivers within the next few days. If he goes unclaimed, he’d have the right to refuse an outright assignment and test minor league free agency both based on having three-plus years of MLB service and having previously been outrighted in his career.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Re: my question earlier today asking what’s the best new consumer product from Google in recent years, their Pixel phones came to mind as my personal answer. I last bought a Pixel 4; I might buy a Pixel 7 this fall. But while successful, in some sense, that success is clearly very much as a niche product. I’m linking here to a story from Ars Technica a few weeks back about Pixel market share hitting ... 2 percent in North America:</p>\n\n\n  <p>That sounds incredibly successful, but this is Google’s tiny\nhardware division we’re talking about, so it’s all relative\nsuccess. The company is now at 2 percent North American market\nshare, having shipped 800,000 devices for Q2 2022. Along with last\nquarter, Google is now regularly hitting whole-digit market share\nnumbers. That’s good enough for fifth place, behind Apple (52\npercent), Samsung (26 percent), Lenovo/Motorola (9 percent), and\nTCL (5 percent).</p>\n\n\n<p>When you need to more than double your market share to catch TCL, you don’t exactly have a hit product line on your hands. 2 percent market share in North America is not a Google-scale success story. Yet the Pixel phones really do seem to me to be the most interesting consumer products (or services) Google has released in years.</p>\n\n\n ★ ",

        "description": "<p>This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.</p><p>The war in Ukraine is far from over, but the Ukrainians have inflicted an immense loss on the Russians. There is a lesson here for all of us about how to deal with extremism in any form.</p><p>But first, here are three new stories from The Atlantic.</p>\r\n\tOne of long COVID’s worst symptoms is also its most misunderstood.\r\n\tJust like that, we’re making oxygen on Mars.\r\n\tTrump opened Pandora’s prosecutorial box.\r\nContain and Defeat<p>Last weekend was full of grief and glory. Queen Elizabeth II died, and like many Americans, I felt the pang of loss. The Queen, a seemingly eternal part of our world, was a stalwart ally of the United States, and a model of dignity and duty. But while focusing on the mourning and pageantry, we might have lost track of another potentially world-changing story in Ukraine.</p><p>The Ukrainians, using a combination of clever strategy, military fortitude, and Western weapons, have routed the Russians from a series of positions around Kharkiv. These were not merely defeats; the Russians were abandoning their posts and leaving behind their equipment even before the Ukrainians could reach them. Apparently, Russian soldiers do not want to die for President Vladimir Putin’s pathetic dream of reestablishing a state that had already perished before some of them were even born.</p><p>This is an immense humiliation for the Russians and for Putin personally, and Russian pundits are already yelling at one another in panic on state television. The Russian state’s newspaper of record, Rossiskaya Gazeta, is, as the analyst Mark Galeotti noted, stammering and contradicting itself trying to wave away yet another Russian military disaster.</p><p>So what happens next? In some quarters, we might expect calls for the Ukrainians to negotiate. But to what end? As my Atlantic colleague Anne Applebaum wrote, there’s nothing to discuss. Putin “has put the destruction of Ukraine at the very center of his foreign and domestic policies, and at the heart of what he wants his legacy to be.” Negotiation, from the first day of the war, was impossible. The only answer was to stand and fight, which the Ukrainians have done with valor and tenacity.</p><p>There is a lesson for all of us here as we face the global attack on democracy. Americans, generally, are the products of a legalistic, free-market, democratic society, so we prize negotiation and dealmaking. We think almost any problem is amenable to rational discussion and good-faith exchanges. Each side gives something and gets something. But what if the person across the table has no interest in compromise?</p><p>Yesterday was the 21st anniversary of 9/11. I recall how the attack generated debates about how we might have avoided such hostility, how we should have understood that we were paying the price for our policies, how we didn’t hear the voices warning us.</p><p>Policies have consequences, but I never believed in such recriminations. Subsequent terrorist incidents over the years, to my mind, proved that we were being attacked for reasons we could not control. There was never a chance of averting violence from al-Qaeda, or from the lost and pathetic men engaging in mindless slaughter in places such as London, Madrid, Paris, and Brussels. (The Tsarnaev brothers, who attacked my beloved city of Boston, were poster boys for nihilism masquerading as a cause. These supposed Muslim warriors were, in reality, a young man described by a friend as “a normal pothead” and his narcissistic older brother, a would-be boxer who was an early suspect in a triple homicide before the Boston Marathon bombing.) Over the years, we learned the lesson that compromise was impossible, and that we would just have to fight groups such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State and their assorted cast of violent losers.</p><p>We then made the same mistake after the January 6 riot at the Capitol. Republicans and others engaged in hand-wringing about how the insurrectionists were expressing “legitimate” grievances. Once again, we were told that we should have been paying more attention to the voices of the unheard—as if somehow, we could have accommodated and satisfied those of our fellow citizens whose minimal demand was the suspension of the Constitution (to say nothing of those who wanted to see the execution of senior elected officials of the United States government).</p><p>Extremism, however, defeats compromise and dealmaking. There was nothing Ukraine could have done, short of immediate surrender, that would have stopped Putin’s invasion. The profusion of violent jihadists, particularly in Europe, is a complex social phenomenon that cannot be reduced to a reaction against U.S. policy. The rioters at the Capitol wanted to nullify an election and hang the vice president of the United States. Sometimes, there’s nothing left on the table to discuss.</p><p>Last week, my colleague Pete Wehner—a man of greater faith and patience than I could ever hope to be—wrote this in The Atlantic:</p>\r\n<p>But even though we shouldn’t give up on individuals, I can’t escape concluding that the time for mollifying grievances is over. In our political endeavors, the task is now to contain and defeat the MAGA movement, shifting away from a model of psychological amelioration and toward a model of political confrontation.</p>\r\n<p>Contain and defeat. If we really are to be partisans of democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and basic decency, then this is a painful truth. Policy has its limits. Negotiations must be grounded in not only good faith but reality, and not lies or myths.</p><p>The demands of extremists are meant to be impossible to fulfill: America must convert to Islam, Ukraine must accept Moscow’s rule, the election must be overturned and Mike Pence hanged. People issuing such demands are not interested in discussion or compromise; indeed, they’d be disappointed if they got what they wanted, because their anger sustains them and gives meaning to their lives. When faced with such movements and their demands, there is only one response: Contain and defeat.</p><p>Related:</p>\r\n\tIt’s time to prepare for a Ukrainian victory.\r\n\tRepublicans will defend Trump through anything.\r\nToday’s News\r\n\tUkrainian troops reclaimed further territory from Russian forces in the northeast and south of the country, reportedly including most of the Kharkiv region.\r\n\tIn Edinburgh, an estimated 20,000 people waited in line to pay their final respects to Queen Elizabeth II, who will lie at rest in St. Giles’ Cathedral until Tuesday afternoon.\r\n\tAmtrak announced temporary cuts to three long-distance passenger routes in response to a potential strike by freight-rail workers.\r\nDispatches\r\n\tHumans Being: The new movie Honk for Jesus.

So about five years ago, he put the question to the group: What would be a good last-place punishment? And before long, an answer emerged: cheese shoes. “One of our league mates, he just started saying it, and we were like, Dude, what?!” DuBois told me. “And he was like, Yeah! Let’s just dump a bunch of cheese in our shoes!”</p>\r\n<p>Read the full article.</p><p>More From The Atlantic</p>\r\n\tAfter the Queen, what is Britain?\r\n\tThe move to eradicate disagreement\r\nCulture Break\r\n(FX; The Atlantic)\r\n<p>Read. “Floaters,” a poem by Arthur Sze. “Magpies fly from branch to branch.

The other night, I dozed through some classics and woke to find myself looking at the big-eyed, bobbing puppets of Thunderbirds, the British series filmed in Supermarionation—a puppeting technique pioneered by the legendary Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. This beloved show was remade as a live-action movie, but it doesn’t work without the weird puppetry. Indeed, I hope MeTV or some other network brings back Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, a 1967 Supermarionation show by the same team that was better, and weirder, than Thunderbirds and had a great theme. (Captain Scarlet is part of a secret army fighting creepy alien invaders called Mysterons, and he’s indestructible, because … look, it’s a puppet show; it doesn’t have to make sense.)</p><p>I saw a loving and nostalgic stage tribute to Thunderbirds in London back in the 1990s, but Supermarionation never got the treatment (and, in a demented way, the respect) it deserved until it was brought back by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the provocateurs behind South Park, in their movie Team America: World Police. It’s hilarious. But be warned: Team America nearly got an NC-17 rating until it was edited, and it is not even remotely a family movie.</p><p>—Tom</p><p>Kelli María Korducki and Isabel Fattal contributed to this newsletter.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Re: my question earlier today asking what’s the best new consumer product from Google in recent years, their Pixel phones came to mind as my personal answer. I last bought a Pixel 4; I might buy a Pixel 7 this fall. But while successful, in some sense, that success is clearly very much as a niche product. I’m linking here to a story from Ars Technica a few weeks back about Pixel market share hitting ... 2 percent in North America:</p>\n\n\n  <p>That sounds incredibly successful, but this is Google’s tiny\nhardware division we’re talking about, so it’s all relative\nsuccess. The company is now at 2 percent North American market\nshare, having shipped 800,000 devices for Q2 2022. Along with last\nquarter, Google is now regularly hitting whole-digit market share\nnumbers. That’s good enough for fifth place, behind Apple (52\npercent), Samsung (26 percent), Lenovo/Motorola (9 percent), and\nTCL (5 percent).</p>\n\n\n<p>When you need to more than double your market share to catch TCL, you don’t exactly have a hit product line on your hands. 2 percent market share in North America is not a Google-scale success story. Yet the Pixel phones really do seem to me to be the most interesting consumer products (or services) Google has released in years.</p>\n\n\n ★ ",

        "description": "<p>The steady decline of gas prices is boosting Democratic hopes. Meanwhile, the Biden administration rolls out updates on deepwater safety drilling rules, and a Senate Republican has a permitting reform bill of her own.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is Overnight Energy &amp; Environment, your source for the latest news focused on energy, the environment and beyond. For The Hill, we’re Rachel Frazin and Zack Budryk. Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\nFalling gas prices give Dems sense of optimism \n\n\n\n<p>Weeks of falling gas prices are dulling what had previously been a sharp Republican weapon, giving Democrats another glimmer of hope ahead of the midterm elections.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Months ago, sky-high gas prices were a major reason why Democrats’ prospects looked bleak. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as candidates hit the homestretch ahead of the Nov. 8 midterms, the lower gas prices are giving reasons for Democrats to think they can be more competitive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It takes a lot of the effectiveness out of a cudgel when people aren’t seeing and feeling it as much,” Democratic strategist Eddie Vale said of gas prices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fall of the summer: Since hitting a June peak of $5.02 on average across the country, U.S. gasoline prices have fallen by $1.30 and are averaging about $3.72 per gallon as of Friday. </p>\n\n\n\nThat’s still relatively high and up about 54 cents from a year ago. It’s about $1.15higher compared to the same day in 2019, prior to the coronavirus pandemic. Still, the prices are going in a better direction for consumers and the party in power. \n\n\n\n<p>Republicans have sought to make the election about inflation — with gas prices being a heavy target. But some polls suggest voters are now looking at other issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the numbers: In a recent poll from Marist, fewer Americans cited inflation as their top voting issue than in a previous poll, indicating that at least some focus is shifting onto other topics. </p>\n\n\n\nWhile Marist found that 30 percent of Americans still consider inflation to be their top voting issue, that number is down from 37 percent of respondents who said the same in July.  The Marist poll also found the number of those surveyed who said abortion was their top issue was growing, from 18 percent in July to 22 percent in September. \n\n\n\n<p>Democrats have zeroed in on abortion rights as a key midterm issue ever since the Supreme Court struck down the Roe v. Wade decision in June. The party has won two special House elections since the court’s decision amid some evidence that more women are registering to vote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about the shift here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\nBiden wants stronger offshore drilling regulations\n\n\n\n<p>The Biden administration on Monday proposed to strengthen certain safety regulations for offshore oil and gas drilling that were loosened under the Trump administration.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill that killed 11 workers and released134 million gallons of fuel into the Gulf of Mexico, the Obama administration implemented new safety regulations.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, the Trump administration revised those standards, making them more industry-friendly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, the Interior Department indicated that it would further tweak the rules, although the new proposal does not appear to be identical to what was put forth during the Obama years.  </p>\n\n\n\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland told reporters on Monday that she believes that the changes will “improve conditions for offshore workers and the public.” She criticized the Trump administration’s rollback of the Obama-era rule, saying that it was done to “tip the balance of oversight of offshore activities back to the oil and gas industry.” \n\n\n\n<p>What’s changing? Among the changes is the reinstatement of a requirement to send information on safety equipment failures to the federal government instead of to certain third parties that were permitted to collect data during the Trump years.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the new rule, inspections of such failures will also need to start sooner. Under the Trump administration, inspections needed to begin 120 days after a failure; they would now need to start in 90. Under the Obama rule, inspections had to be finished within 120 days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about the changes here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\nSenate GOP introduces its own permitting reform bill\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) has introduced separate legislation to overhaul the permitting process for energy projects, as Democrats debate a similar proposal agreed on by Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Capito, the ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, presented the bill as necessary to give industry “regulatory certainty.” She also said the proposal would expedite the completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a project set to run through West Virginia. Manchin has made the completion of the pipeline a major priority, and the summary of the side deal reached with Schumer includes removing several obstacles to the goal.  </p>\n\n\n\nThe West Virginia Republican also framed her separate introduction of a bill as in response to the lack of public text from Manchin, who has thus far released a summary of the proposal.   “Since our calls for action and offers to see legislative text from the permitting ‘deal’ remain unheeded, Republicans are introducing this legislation today to deliver solutions to the roadblocks, delays, and postponements of key infrastructure projects across the country,” Capito said in a statement.  \n\n\n\n<p>Thirty-eight Senate Republicans co-sponsored the measure, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Minority Whip John Thune (S.D.) and Energy Committee ranking member Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After over a year of negotiations, Manchin struck a deal with Schumer to support a sweeping Democratic climate and infrastructure bill in exchange for agreeing to introduce the separate permitting reform bill. The side bill has sparked fierce backlash from climate hawks in the Democratic caucus, and it remains unclear if Republican support for the measure exists to offset any Democrats who decline to support it.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about the bill here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WHAT WE'RE READING</p>\n\n\n\nCedar Creek wildfire stirs strength and stress among fleeing Oregon residents (OregonLive) White House alarm rises over Europe as Putin threatens energy supply (The Washington Post) EV supply chain announcements snowballing post Inflation Reduction Act (S&amp;P Global) Here’s the alarming amount of ice California’s longest glacier just lost in the heat wave (The San Francisco Chronicle) The Green Dream to Rebuild a Sustainable Ukraine from the Rubble of War (Politico) \n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>ICYMI</p>\n\n\n\nBiden pledges to improve outdated US airports Air pollution can trigger lung cancer in nonsmokers: research Gas prices could spike again this winter, Yellen warns \n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>🐦 Lighter click: Good for them</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it for today, thanks for reading.

        "description": "<p>Australia’s wily trash-raiding cockatoos are running up against human ingenuity in a real-time evolutionary “arms race,” a new study has found. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dynamic relationship between cockatoos who want to open trash bins and the humans who want to keep them out is driving both species to new feats of “social learning,” according to the study, published on Monday in Current Biology. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Groups of the cockatoos, a social species native to Australia, had learned to open trash bins in two Sydney suburbs — and spread the method to “cockatoo colleagues” in 40 more, as we reported last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This rapid diffusion of trash-raiding strategies is a reflection of cockatoo culture, lead author Barbara Klump, of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, said in a statement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The cockatoos learn the behavior from observing other cockatoos and within each group they sort of have their own special technique, so across a wide geographic range the techniques are more dissimilar,” Klump said.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cockatoos have hacked a weakness in Sydney’s garbage management system, according to the researchers. The bins can’t be sealed against them without also ruining the ability of the city’s semi-automated trash trucks to pick them up.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that need has created a niche for more creative deterrents, from hinge-blocking sticks to rocks that weigh down bin lids. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It's not just social learning on the cockatoo side, but it's also social learning on the human side,” Klump says. “People come up with new protection methods on their own, but a lot of people actually learn it from their neighbors or people on their street, so they get their inspiration from someone else.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to Equilibrium, a newsletter that tracks the growing global battle over the future of sustainability.

Plus: Why the White House is worried about a proposed rail strike next week, and a surprise culprit in mining-related deforestation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\nAir Quality Concerns \n\n\n\n<p>Wildfires gripping the Pacific Northwest are making the air far less breathable across the U.S. West, as windy weather transports hazardous particles and over multiple state lines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blazes abound: First responders were fighting 16 large fires in the Pacific Northwest on Monday, with smoke conditions persisting throughout the region, according to the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center — a hub for federal and state woodland fire agencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>About a third of the major active fires across the West are in Idaho, while the greatest total burned acreage is in Oregon, the National Interagency Fire Center said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Montana, Washington state, Utah, Wyoming and California also have large active fires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Far away from the fire, up in smoke: The Pacific Northwest was already contending with widespread air quality issues following a smoky weekend, though now areas far away from the rolling conflagrations are facing deteriorating air conditions as well.</p>\n\n\n\n“It's something that the people who live here have kind of gotten used to, but I think their health is affected by it,” Bob Yokelson, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Montana, told Equilibrium.Yokelson’s region of Montana, located just east of the Idaho panhandle, has been enduring an influx of smoke predominantly from fires raging in Idaho, but also from those in Washington, Oregon and Western Canada.\n\n\n\n<p>Things are getting worse: “It's one of the few regions here in the Pacific Northwest where the air hasn't been getting better over the years,” Yokelson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Climate change and past fuel management are making the fires worse,” he continued, noting that Montana is situated downwind from most Northwest wildfire hotspots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Effects on human health: While Montana is coping with brutal air quality, states from the Midwest to the Mountain West are also bracing for the possible health effects of these fires located hundreds of miles away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such pollution comes from fine particulate matter — known as PM 2.5, or particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 microns — which is prominent in wildfire ash and can cause respiratory health issues.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out-of-state smoke: Colorado’s Department of Public Health and Environment issued a smoke outlook on Monday morning, warning “hazy skies and light to moderate concentrations of smoke are possible” in parts of the state.</p>\n\n\n\nSuch air quality conditions, according to the agency, would be “due to smoke from out-of-state wildfires.”While no significant public health impacts were expected, the agency advised that sensitive individuals should reduce heavy exertion in areas where smoke is apparent.\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>SPREADING THE SMOKE</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The smoke is spreading great distances due to a high-pressure weather system that has set in over the Great Basin watershed, Frank Flocke, an atmospheric chemist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told Equilibrium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such systems, which are common in the summer, cause the air to rotate clockwise and can pick up smoke from California, Oregon and Idaho and carry it down to distant states like Colorado, Flocke explained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where exactly are the fires? Among the Pacific Northwest blazes feeding this system is central Oregon’s Cedar Creek Fire, which grew to 86,734 acres on Monday, according to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group.</p>\n\n\n\nIn northeastern Oregon’s Wallowa National Forest, the Double Creek Fire burned 155,297 acres.Thirty-four large fires were blazing in Idaho, including the Moose Fire, which burned 125,925 acres.Washington’s Bolt Creek and Goat Rocks fires also burned 7,660 acres and 2,842 acres respectively.\n\n\n\n<p>Weather systems unaccustomed to fire: While high-pressure weather systems over the Great Basin are regular occurrences of summer, the sources of the smoke — Western wildfires — have increased in intensity in recent years, according to Flocke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There are more fires now outside of what was traditionally considered the fire season,” he said, noting that such a shift could potentially be attributed to climate change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Now we’re getting more smoke and more often and for longer periods of time because there are more fires and the fire season is extended and is getting more intense,” Flocke added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To read the full story, please click here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\nWhite House races to avert rail strike  \n\n\n\n<p>U.S. railways could shut down next week if national rail carriers can’t reach a deal with leading unions of train workers around labor conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scramble session: The White House was holding emergency meetings on Monday in an effort to avoid a strike, which would lead to nationwide shutdowns, The Washington Post reported.</p>\n\n\n\nThe crisis pits President Biden’s desire to support labor with his desire to head off a breakdown in the nation’s transport infrastructure. The strike will begin on Friday — shutting down 30 percent of the country’s freight and virtually all of its passenger rail — if an agreement isn’t reached. \n\n\n\n<p>Corporate terrorism: Leading rail union leaders on Sunday accused major railroad companies of “corporate terrorism”, The Associated Press reported. </p>\n\n\n\nThey were responding to an announcement by freight railroad operators that they were delaying some shipments this week in advance of a potential strike next week. “The railroads are using shippers, consumers, and the supply chain of our nation as pawns in an effort to get our unions to cave in to their contract demands,” two union leaders wrote in a statement. \n\n\n\n<p>Quality of life: Two leading railroad unions have not yet consented to a deal with operators like Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and BNSF. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For these groups, quality of life is the sticking point in their negotiations, CNBC reported.</p>\n\n\n\nThe two unions — Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the SMART Transportation Division — represent half of all unionized railroad workers. Eight other leading unions reached a preliminary agreement, which didn’t include the provisions around attendance policies, vacations and sick time. These two unions have pushed back against new attendance policies by Fort Worth, Texas-based BSNF — a wholly owned subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway — that workers called “brutal.” \n\n\n\n<p>Losing points: At issue is a points-based attendance system BNSF rolled out in February, CNBC noted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This system helped the operator streamline administration and avoid discrimination suits — at the cost of infuriating many rail workers, Texas-based D Magazine reported earlier this year. </p>\n\n\n\nWalmart and Amazon also use pointsbased systems. These companies, however, are almost entirely non-union. \n\n\n\n<p>Burning out: Union leaders said the relentless pace of work during the combined supply chain and pandemic-related crises had pushed them to a breaking point </p>\n\n\n\n“We’re facing the potential of a strike because the railroad refuses to grant one single day of sick time,” Ron Kaminkow of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen — one of the outstanding unions — told the Post. “It’s about the phone rings at 2 a.m. to be at work at 4 a.m. after just 10 hours of rest,” Kaminkow said. “It’s about not knowing when you’re coming home and being penalized with discipline up to firing if you need to go to the doctor.” \n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\nBattery material mining linked to deforestation\n\n\n\n<p>Industrial mining in Indonesia was a major contributor to tropical deforestation over the past two decades, a new paper has found. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deforestation for minerals: The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday, raises questions about Indonesia’s push to be a sustainable source for the minerals needed worldwide for clean tech. </p>\n\n\n\nIndonesia is by far the world’s leading producer of nickel, according to theU.S. Geological Survey. Nickel is a critical material for producing electric vehicle batteries. \n\n\n\n<p>Urgent questions: “Against the rapidly growing demands for minerals, in particular for metals for renewable energy and e-mobility technologies, government and industry policies must take into account both the direct and indirect impacts of extraction,” coauthor Anthony Bebbington, of Clark University said in a statement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly 60 percent of all deforestation

fine </p>\n\n\n\nWhile the Gulf of Maine is undergoing rapid warming — conditions that could hamper lobster survival — the 2022 lobster catch has remained strong thus far, according to The Washington Post. The lobster industry has engineered flexible transportation mechanisms that can keep the animals alive and healthy in high temperatures, while primary predators have decreased due to overfishing, the Post reported. \n\n\n\n<p>Climate change worsening Hong Kong’s housing crisis </p>\n\n\n\nSoaring real estate prices and long waits for public housing in Hong Kong have pushed the city’s poorest into residences that fail to withstand oppressive summer heat, The Washington Post reported. A 2021 report showed that about 220,000 people — 3 percent of the city’s population — lived in crowded rooftop huts and subdivided apartments, which were 9-11 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than outdoors, according to the Post. \n\n\n\n<p>Could a new payment code for guns head off mass shootings? </p>\n\n\n\nCredit card companies Visa, American Express and Mastercard agreed on Sunday to begin using a new international code for purchases from gun stores — a measure gun safety advocates have flagged as a means of avoiding mass shootings, The New York Times reported. That builds on an existing debate that has raged all year over whether environment, social and governance (ESG) funds should be investing in firearms at all, as the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute noted. \n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please visit The Hill’s Sustainability section online for the web version of this newsletter and more stories.

        "description": "<p>The Justice Department has issued roughly 40 subpoenas in the past week in connection with its investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election by former President Trump and his allies, The New York Times reported Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An attorney for Bernard Kerik, the former New York Police commissioner who emerged as a vocal Trump supporter and claimed there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election, confirmed Kerik was one of the individuals to receive a subpoena.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attorney Timothy Parlatore said the subpoena was served early last week when a team of FBI agents arrived at Kerik's home. Parlatore would not share the subpoena, but described it as broad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Basically, give us anything and everything related to anybody that is tangentially related to the Trump campaign including a long, long laundry list,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The New York Times reported that Boris Ephsteyn, who served as an adviser to the 2020 Trump campaign and helped with challenges to the election results, had his phone seized as evidence, as did Mike Roman, who was part of a plan to submit alternative electors to then-Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan Scavino, a top White House aide throughout Trump’s four years in office, was also subpoenaed, the Times reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Stanley Woodward, an attorney for Scavino, declined to comment</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Times reported that the subpoenas seek information related to a plan concocted by Trump associates to submit slates of alternative electors from states like Georgia, Pennsylvania and Arizona, which President Biden narrowly won in 2020. The goal was to submit names of electors who would cast their support for Trump instead of Biden, potentially upending the result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Congress ultimately certified Biden as the winner on Jan. 6, 2021, after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol complex in a bid to derail the proceedings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The progress in the Justice Department’s investigation into the events surrounding Jan. 6 and the 2020 election come as the agency is also investigating Trump’s handling of classified materials after leaving office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FBI last month searched Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after it for months tried to secure sensitive documents the former president had taken with him after leaving office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riots is also expected to resume its work following the summer recess. It has previously held several public hearings highlighting Trump’s false claims of election fraud, efforts to pressure Pence to overturn the election, and the violence that unfolded on Jan. 6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebecca Beitsch contributed.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Federal authorities have arrested a Texas woman who they say made death threats against the Florida judge overseeing a court battle between former President Trump and the Department of Justice over documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago residence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tiffani Shea Gish was charged with influencing a federal official by threat and interstate communications with the threat to kidnap or injure, according to an affidavit submitted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas on Sept. 6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to federal authorities, Gish claimed to be an official with the U.S. government working with nuclear weapons and left three threatening voicemails for federal Judge Aileen Cannon on Sept. 1, just days after the Florida judge sided with Trump and ruled she would appoint a special master to sift through the documents the FBI took in the search of his estate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Donald Trump has been disqualified long ago, and he's marked for assassination, you're helping him,\" Gish allegedly said, before proceeding to call the judge explicit names. \"And guess what? I'm also Trump's hitman, so consider it a bullet to your head from Donald Trump himself.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An FBI agent wrote in court documents that Gish left another voicemail hours later, saying she was heading to Florida and would put a bullet in the judge's head \"in front of her kids.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannon forwarded the voicemails to Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Michael Witkowski. Authorities said they tracked Gish to her Houston, Texas, residence through her cellphone number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gish admitted she left the voicemails when she was interviewed by law enforcement personnel, according to the affidavit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another filing, federal agents said Gish has a history of \"delusional conduct,\" including posing as CIA agents and Army Rangers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The appointment of a special master to identify material covered by attorney-client or executive privilege has drawn widespread criticism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) is probing whether Trump violated the Espionage Act and Presidential Records Act by taking both presidential and classified documents to Florida.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3639363-a-radical-idea-to-fund-climate-adaptation-globally/",
        "description": "<p>A lawsuit brought by a smallholder Peruvian farmer holding the biggest polluter in Europe responsible for its historic greenhouse gas emissions is currently making its way through the German court system — and with it brings a potential paradigm shift in the way that the private sector approaches climate change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first time, if successful the lawsuit would hold the high-emitting German utility RWE liable for damages to this farmer, Saul Luciano Lliuya’s, property proportionate to its historical emissions (melting snow and ice from a nearby mountain summit threaten to overflow the lake in his small town). It could also have to pay for the required adaptation response, such as covering the cost of a much bigger dam and/or a pumping system at the glacial lake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just Lliuya and his neighbors — around the world, those facing disproportionate amounts of climate change impacts are in low-income and developing countries in the Global South that are historically least responsible for the emissions causing these climate changes. But they lack the resources to fund adaptation projects that will help them survive these impacts. In fact, controversially, financing long promised by the Global North has never materialized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As courts reckon with legal issues of responsibility for climate change, we need another force to step in and help with these issues: global capital markets. While companies are turning to markets to deal with renewable energy credits and carbon sequestration credits, they’re ignoring funding urgently needed climate adaptation — which they have contributed to the need for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need a new system that gives companies the opportunity to privately fund climate adaptation measures, in order to recompense their historical emissions and the damage that these emissions have caused. This market-based mechanism would help companies be shielded from lawsuits like this one, as well as voluntarily opt in to new corporate environmental social and governance (ESG) efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An adaptation credits marketplace would function similarly to carbon marketplaces. One adaptation credit would be equivalent to a carbon credit valued at the social cost of carbon: $51/ton (the latest estimate from the Biden administration). Companies could buy credits for various projects; for example, a corn farmer in India, who would need to invest $10,000 for a 5-acre farm to reduce his vulnerability to climate impacts via investing in drip irrigation, drought-resistant seeds, etc., would need about 200 credits. Credits for hundreds of corn farmers could be pooled by the local co-operative and listed on the adaptation marketplace, where corporate buyers such as Microsoft, Shell, and others can participate. Shell as an example contributed nearly 32 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of emissions between 1750 and 2018 — it could buy up to 32 million adaptation credits globally, helping fund a plethora of projects (the actual number may vary depending on the number of carbon offsets bought by Shell already). This would unlock up to $1.6 billion into adaptation funding from Shell alone for adaptation in developing economies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A climate adaptation credits marketplace would be a tangible way for companies to make amends for historic emissions in the communities they have most affected, even if those are across the world from headquarters. The Googles of the world could provide funding for drought-resistant seeds for the drought-ridden smallholder farmers in the Horn of Africa; the Microsofts of the world could finance coastal restoration measures in Pacific Island nations facing sea-level rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United Nations estimates that adaptation costs in developing countries are five to 10 times greater than current public adaptation finance flows, and the adaptation finance gap is widening — an opportunity for the private sector to step up and plug that gap. Many high-income countries are some of the largest historical emitters and also need to step up in their funding for low-income companies, but so are multinational companies. They should meet this moment with new leadership on the global stage for climate action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agriculture and forestry projects (such as mangrove restoration) would be one of the lowest hanging fruits with byproducts of reducing emissions as well. The benefits could be monitored and tracked using satellite imagery in the form of yield improvements and/or the growth of the forest. This system could also fund adaptation credits for the built environment and cities. At the city level, municipalities and utilities could issue such credits with funding tied to project completions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondary benefits from this type of system include the acceleration of new climate-resilient industries, such as small seed companies providing climate-resilient seeds and weatherproofing materials companies. New climate jobs for residents in these communities unlock much-needed clean economies around the world. According to a recent report by Global Commission on Adaptation, a $1 investment in adaptation leads to $4 in economic benefits within this decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, similarly to the early days of the carbon offset market, this climate adaptation market might initially run into some challenges quantifying adaptation progress and verification. But both carbon offsets for mitigation and adaptation credits are needed to tackle climate change, which is an urgent and underfunded need that must be included in any adequate climate change strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbon offsets simply don’t go far enough to make up for the ongoing impacts of climate change that historical emissions have already caused and are continuing to cause. Building an adaptation credits marketplace would help build climate resilience worldwide. Starting with low-hanging fruits such as agriculture and flood-proofing infrastructure would pave the way to other interventions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most importantly, it will unite the north-south for an issue that is not a long-term issue anymore. We are in the middle of the most serious food crisis since World War II, accelerated by climate change. We need global efforts at the same scale to ensure just, resilient adaptation and recovery because by the time you finished this, nearly 500 more people would have become food insecure. We urgently need to accelerate climate solutions, especially in the adaptation space. This new system is exactly the kind of bold action that the world needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Himanshu Gupta is the co-founder and CEO of ClimateAi, a climate resilience platform for food, water, and energy security for supply chains. </p>",

        "description": "<p>It all ended pretty much as it started — despite months of recriminations, patronage allegations and backroom dealings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alessandro Chiocchetti will become the European Parliament’s new secretary-general, a powerful post overseeing the institution’s expansive bureaucracy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chiocchetti was a controversial candidate from the start. As Parliament President Roberta Metsola’s chief of staff, he was seen as the beneficiary of nepotism. He also benefited from secret horse-trading that saw Parliament create several new jobs to secure political support for Chiocchetti. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Metsola and her large, center-right European People’s Party (EPP) group, which backed Chiocchetti, insisted they were just following Parliament procedure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parliament’s leadership finalized Chiocchetti’s appointment Monday night in a closed-door meeting, according to two people in the room and three briefed on the outcome. The decision, while long in the making, left some members fuming. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The sordid saga to install Mr. Chiocchetti as the new secretary-general of the European Parliament is bound to damage the Parliament’s reputation in the eyes of European citizens and representatives of other EU institutions,” said Heidi Hautala from the Greens, who was at Monday’s meeting and voted against Chiocchetti.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While supporters initially claimed Chiocchetti’s appointment was decided on merits and not as part of any package deal, both The Left and Renew Europe groups ultimately did secure political concessions in exchange for their support, five people involved in the decision said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the centrist Renew, Parliament will create a “deputy secretary-general” post. A Renew spokesperson confirmed the new job, saying leaders had agreed Monday that it will go to Anders Rasmussen, a Renew candidate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, The Left will get to lead a new Parliament unit, officially called the Directorate-General for Parliamentary Democracy Partnerships.</p>\n\n\n\nA pre-baked deal?\n\n\n\n<p>To many critics — some of whom did not mince their words — Chiocchetti’s ascension confirmed their warnings that the decision was prebaked from the start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Lolek has been appointed to head the new DG SHIT and Bolek the new DG FUCK,” said one senior official from Parliament’s management, referencing the Polish cartoon characters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar censures had flown in from everywhere in recent weeks. Good government groups warned Parliament it was tarnishing its standing. Unions deplored the lack of competition for the job. Even MEPs from groups involved in the political swaps that secured Chiocchetti’s promotion grumbled over the process.</p>\n\n\n\nThe Greens’ Heidi Hautala was publically critical of the proposal to install Chiocchetti as secretary-general and voted against it at Monday’s meeting.\n\n\n\n<p>But Metsola and the EPP maintained that the secretary-general job is, ultimately, “an appointment not a selection,” as a spokesman for Metsola put it. Even as the opprobrium came down, they held their ground and stood behind their choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on Monday night, the Parliament’s Bureau, a leadership body featuring Metsola and other senior lawmakers, formalized Chiocchetti’s appointment. While leaders from the EPP, Renew and The Left voted in favor, leaders of the Greens and Socialists &amp; Democrats (S&amp;D) agreed beforehand not to back Chiocchetti and instead called for a more open selection process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, two S&amp;D members — Pina Picierno from Italy and Eva Kaili from Greece — broke with the group line and backed Chiocchetti, according to three people with knowledge of the vote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chiocchetti will replace Klaus Welle, the Parliament’s influential — and best-paid — bureaucratic leader, who is stepping down at the end of the year. As secretary-general, Chiocchetti will inherit a role Welle crafted into an EU power broker. The position holds sway on everything from Parliament’s agenda to its massive real estate portfolio and key personnel decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A bitter taste will inevitably linger for some.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Every other European Parliament civil servant has to go through a complicated interview process, but the top civil servant will simply be appointed in a backroom deal,” one Bureau member told POLITICO’s Brussels Playbook earlier this week as it became clear Chiocchetti would get the job.</p>\n\n\n\nHow we got here\n\n\n\n<p>In July, POLITICO first reported that a deal was forming to place Chiocchetti in the Parliament’s senior civil service job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hand-shake agreement seemed to involve the creation of a new policy department within Parliament that The Left political group would lead in exchange for the group backing the EPP’s choice, Chiocchetti. Meanwhile, the EPP also weakened the criteria for the secretary-general post to ensure Chiocchetti would qualify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The revelation of those plans set off a whirlwind of criticism that extended beyond the initial deal to frustration over Chiocchetti himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to serving as Metsola’s chief of staff, Chiocchetti was close to Welle and former Parliament President Antonio Tajani.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, he also served as an assistant to Marcello Dell’Utri, the Italian politician convicted and sentenced to prison for seven years for his ties to the Sicilian mafia. Chiocchetti has not been accused of corruption or mafia ties, but his links to Dell’Utri remained a source of consternation within Parliament.</p>\n\n\n\nFormer Italian politician Marcello Dell’Utri | Damien Meyer/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n<p>While Chiocchetti was always the likely frontrunner to become secretary-general, there were ultimately three other candidates for the role. At Monday night’s meeting, each was given a few minutes to present their credentials, but Bureau members weren’t allowed to ask questions before voting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was this design that left government transparency NGOs irate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a letter published over the weekend, Transparency International implored Parliament to abandon the “sordid backroom deal” and “launch a new, truly transparent process.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many close EU observers, the process has overtones of Martin Selmayr’s appointment as the European Commission’s secretary-general in 2018. Selmayr similarly slipped into the role from his perch as chief of staff to the institution’s then president, Jean-Claude Juncker. He also did it via a series of secret arrangements that took even some senior EU officials by surprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critics of Chiocchetti’s elevation have noted that Selmayr’s appointment prompted an investigation from the EU’s ombudsman, Emily O’Reilly, who ultimately concluded there had been “maladministration” in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another critic of that process: The European Parliament. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Commission, the Parliament said in a resolution at the time, ignored “extensive and widespread criticism.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, the resolution noted, the EU had suffered “reputational damage.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Florian Eder contributed reporting.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Phillies announced they’ve activated righty Zach Eflin from the 60-day injured list. To open a spot on the 40-man roster, Philadelphia recalled right-hander Mark Appel from Triple-A Lehigh Valley and placed him on the MLB 60-day IL.</p>\n<p>Eflin returns to the active roster for the first time since June 26. The 28-year-old has been bothered by a right knee contusion, the continuation of career-long issues with the joint. He’s undergone surgery on the knee in both 2016 and ’21, and while he didn’t need to go under the knife this time around, the club no doubt factored in his injury history in determining how quickly he could ramp back up. Eflin just began a minor league rehab assignment last Friday, tossing two innings and 27 pitches in Lehigh Valley. After one game, he’s ready to jump right back to the big leagues.</p>\n<p>The rehab stint had to be expedited by the lack of time remaining on the regular season schedule. There’s a bit more than three weeks to play, and the 78-62 Phils are battling for their first postseason appearance in over a decade. Philadelphia is 1 1/2 games up on the Padres for the National League’s second Wild Card spot, with a three-game cushion between themselves and the only viable threat to bump them out of the playoff picture entirely, the Brewers.</p>\n<p>There wasn’t sufficient time to build Eflin back to a traditional starter’s workload, so he’ll move into the bullpen for interim skipper Rob Thomson. Philadelphia’s relief corps has been middle-of-the-pack this season. That’s a marked improvement over the past couple years, but the Phils recently lost Corey Knebel for the season. Trade deadline acquisition David Robertson, Seranthony Domínguez (himself recently activated from the injured list) and Connor Brogdon have emerged as Thomson’s top right-handed options.</p>\n<p>Working from the bullpen is unfamiliar territory for Eflin, who has started 115 of his 120 MLB appearances. He’s been a reliable mid-rotation arm for the majority of that time, posting an ERA between 3.97 and 4.37 in each of the past five years. Eflin has been one of the game’s most consistent strike-throwers, and while he hasn’t missed many bats, he’ll be one of the steadier rotation options available on this winter’s free agent market.</p>\n<p>Appel’s season comes to an unfortunate early close. He’s battling inflammation in his throwing elbow, according to the club’s transactions log at MLB.com, and the 60-day minimum officially closes the books on his returning this year. Appel’s most recent appearance with Lehigh Valley came on September 3, and he landed on the minor league injured list not too long thereafter.</p>\n<p>It’s a disappointing conclusion to the year, but 2022 has to go down as a resounding success for the former first overall pick. Appel never reached the big leagues with his original organization, the Astros, and he looked as if he’d never appear at the highest level after stepping away from the game following the 2017 campaign. Appel made a comeback effort last year, and he remained in the Philadelphia system this season. Appel earned his long-awaited first promotion in mid-June, and he finishes the season with 10 1/3 innings of two-run ball in the big leagues.</p>\n<p>Philadelphia will pay Appel at the prorated $700K MLB minimum rate for the rest of the season to temporarily remove him from the 40-man roster. The 31-year-old is in his second of three minor league option years and can continue to bounce on and off the Phils active roster next season.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Between games of today’s doubleheader against the Rangers, the Marlins designated reliever Aneurys Zabala for assignment, tweets Daniel Álvarez Montes of El Extrabase. The move clears space on the active roster for lefty Braxton Garrett, who has been reinstated from the 15-day injured list to take the ball in game two. Miami’s 40-man roster tally falls to 39.</p>\n<p>It’s an incredibly quick turnaround for Zabala, whose contract was just selected this afternoon. He was in the bullpen for the first game of the twin bill but didn’t make an appearance in a 3-2 loss. He now loses the roster spot he occupied for a few hours, although he’ll at least collect a major league salary for today and any time he spends in DFA limbo.</p>\n<p>Zabala has been selected and designated for assignment on three separate occasions this year. He’s made only two MLB appearances — the first of his career — tossing 2 2/3 scoreless frames while averaging over 99 MPH on his heater. The 25-year-old has had a tough season in Triple-A Jacksonville, walking more than a quarter of batters faced en route to a 9.47 ERA through 19 innings. If he goes unclaimed on waivers, he’d have the right to refuse an outright assignment in favor of minor league free agency, but he’s already foregone that possibility once this year.</p>",

        "description": "Peter Petokas, from the Clean Water Institute at Lycoming College, and Michelle Herman, from The Wetland Trust, with a young hellbender they helped raise in captivity and released in 2018.Laura Benshoff/NPR<p>By a tributary of the Susquehanna River, biologist Michelle Herman is carefully swabbing a kind of rare, giant salamander called an eastern hellbender for invasive fungus.</p><p>\"The first one snapped at me when I did the chin rub. It was very feisty,\" she says. Herman is part of a small group trying to repopulate hellbenders in an area where their numbers have sharply declined. </p><p>\"They don't have many advocates so I'm happy to be a hellbender advocate,\" says Herman, who works for The Wetland Trust, a non-profit conservation organization.</p><p>Bald eagles have soared back from the brink. Grizzly bear numbers are rebounding. But conservation is expensive, and thousands of less charismatic species are competing for scarce resources in the United States, with as many as a million facing extinction around the world, according to the United Nations. </p><p>Existing federal conservation funding only covers about 5% of what's needed to help the more than 12,000 \"species of greatest conservation need\" identified by state and tribal wildlife agencies, according to the Alliance for America's Fish and Wildlife.</p>Hellbenders live under giant rocks in the streambed. Petokas and an undergraduate student use snorkel gear to try to find them.Laura Benshoff/NPR<p>In the hellbender's case, champions in this part of their range cobbled together resources from the Bronx Zoo and elsewhere to raise them in captivity, tag them with microchips, and release them back into the wild. But they have also tried a number of unorthodox tactics to raise the animal's profile and attract conservation funding.</p><p>Peter Petokas, research associate with the Clean Water Institute at Lycoming College, tried crowdfunding. His work helped inspire a group of high school students who lobbied the Pennsylvania legislature to declare it the official state amphibian.</p><p>\"They borrowed my Hellbender costume, which is really cool,\" says Petokas. After two years of canvassing elected officials, the students succeeded. But none of this led to more funding, he says.</p>Hellbenders have several nickname related to their unusual appearance, including \"lasagna lizard,\" \"snot otter,\" and \"Allegheny alligator.\"Laura Benshoff/NPRFederal funding tends to go towards game species<p>Since the 1930s, the U.S. has taxed hunting and licenses, as well as guns, ammo, and other equipment, to raise money for conservation. In the 1950, that model was expanded to include fishing licenses and equipment with the Dingell-Johnson Act.</p><p>Mike Leahy, Director of Wildlife, Hunting, and Fishing Policy with the National Wildlife Federation, says as a result that money often goes to species that hunters and anglers care about, such as deer and elk.</p><p>\"There has been this gap in getting funding to species that aren't hunted and fished,\" he says.</p><p>But many species identified as in-need of conservation have a less direct relationship to humans. Invertebrates such as mollusks and insects, as well as fish and bird species are all threatened in large numbers, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.</p><p>Many conservationists talk about the loss of these species like flying a plane while slowly removing each bolt, or a game of Jenga. Each one gone weakens whole ecosystems. But others prefer to think about conservation in positive terms, as an investment.</p><p>\"I think the real value of preserving a really rare and unique species is to have it there for the future, for everybody else to enjoy,\" says Petokas.</p>A hellbender waits for its health check up in a container of river water. The animals are fully aquatic and breathe through frilly folds that run along the sides of their bodies.Laura Benshoff/NPR<p>Wildlife advocates hope that this imbalance could soon change. A bill called the Recovering America's Wildlife Act, which passed the House of Representatives earlier this summer, would dramatically increase how much the federal government spends to protect U.S. wildlife by creating a $1.3 billion annual fund for conservation. </p><p>Led by Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Roy Blount (R-Missouri), the Senate bill has more than 40 co-sponsors, including 16 Republicans.</p><p>\"By conserving wildlife habitat, we'll also preserve outdoor recreation activities like hunting, fishing, and wildlife viewing that support millions of additional jobs,\" said Blount, earlier this year.</p>A wildlife technician with New York State Department of Environmental Conservation returns two hellbenders to the rocks in the stream where they live.Laura Benshoff/NPR<p>The money would go to states and tribal governments to decide how to spend. The Act would also require that 15% of the amount support federally-listed endangered species. But it is not clear if the bill, which must still come up with a funding source to offset the cost of increased conservation spending, will come up for a vote this year. </p><p>\"If it passes, [it] will really shift the paradigm. It will be an absolute game-changer, \" says Sarina Jepsen, Endangered Species Program Director at the Xerces Society, a non-profit specializing in the conservation of invertebrates. </p><p>Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "An anti-monarchy demonstrator protests outside Palace of Westminster in central London on Monday. A number of arrests in the U.K. are sparking questions about freedom of speech.Marco Bertorello/AFP via Getty Images<p>\"Not my king.\" </p><p>\"He is and there is nothing you can do about it.\" </p><p>That exchange between two commenters on Twitter encapsulates the current friction in the United Kingdom, where King Charles III's ascension to the throne has sparked anti-royalist protests.</p><p>In dramatic ways, the dynamic is playing out in real life: police have made a series of arrests against people protesting the monarchy in recent days, raising questions about the right to freedom of speech as the U.K. proclaims a new head of state to replace the late Queen Elizabeth II. </p>Police in Scotland allege breaches of peace<p>In widely seen photos, a woman holding a sign reading \"Abolish monarchy\" and \"F*** imperialism\" was arrested on Sunday at St. Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh, where the queen's body is to lie at rest until Tuesday.</p><p>\"Let her go! It's free speech!\" one man shouted, according to The Scotsman newspaper. Others yelled back, \"Have some respect.\"</p><p>The woman, 22, was arrested \"in connection with a breach of the peace,\" a Police Scotland spokesperson told NPR, adding that she was formally charged and released, and her case is now pending at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.</p><p>Similar reports emerged Monday, including one case involving a man who was seen being forcibly removed from a parade barrier after shouting at the royal procession leading to the cathedral. He was reportedly heckling Prince Andrew.</p><p>And in London, a woman was led away by four uniformed officers on Monday after holding up a sign reading \"Not my king\" — which has become a trending hashtag — near Westminster Hall.</p>Protester says he didn't disrespect the late queen<p>The most high-profile case comes from Oxford, where author and activist Symon Hill says he was arrested for protesting Charles' ascension, in what he called \"an outrageous assault on democracy.\"</p><p>Hill said he objected only to Charles being proclaimed king, and that he didn't do anything to disrespect Elizabeth or disrupt those mourning her.</p><p>\"It was only when they declared Charles to be 'King Charles III' that I called out 'Who elected him?'\" Hill said as he related  his experience. \"I doubt most of the people in the crowd even heard me. Two or three people near me told me to shut up.\"</p>The U.K. adopted new laws on protests this year<p>Hill said police initially told him he was arrested under the U.K.'s recently toughened laws on protests, a change that came after advocacy groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Black Lives Matter mounted large and/or disruptive protests in recent years.</p><p>The new law allows police to act in cases which they deem to be \"unjustifiably noisy protests that may have a significant impact on others\" or seriously disrupt an organization's activities.</p>A demonstrator against the U.K.'s royal head of state holds a sign reading \"Republic Now\" at an accession proclamation ceremony for King Charles III in Edinburgh, Scotland.WPA Pool/Getty Images<p>The arrests highlight individuals' troubles with the authorities — but large groups have also chosen or been forced to change their plans due to Elizabeth's death.  </p><p>Extinction Rebellion had for months planned to hold a large protest in London this past weekend, dubbed the Festival of Resistance. But after the queen died, the group postponed its plan, saying that \"occupying a Royal Park at this time would not be practical.\"</p><p>Groups such as Republic — in the U.K., to be a Republican means to support the end of monarchy — are amplifying calls for change, sharing comments from people who are comparing the crackdown on protests in the U.K. to the actions of authoritarian regimes. </p><p>Republic said on Monday that it's contacting police agencies to ask about the rules for demonstrators, adding that it intends to organize protests around Charles' coronation \"and will expect those protests to be allowed to go ahead peacefully.\" </p><p>Copyright 2022 NPR.

Shortly after that device's launch, reports surfaced that the laptop and tablet division was being downsized. While the tablet plans managed to recover thanks to Android, the laptop plans are apparently dead. The last credible Google laptop rumors were from the lead-up to the Google Tensor/Pixel 6 launch. Google was rumored to be making its own chips and, along with phone (Pixel 6) rumors, consistently claimed a laptop version of the chip would be happening. Google Hardware SVP Rick Osterloh said as recently as May that the company was \"going to do Pixelbooks in the future.\" According to the report, \"the device was far along in development and expected to debut next year\" before it was canceled.</p>\n<p>The reason for the dissolution of the Pixelbook team is apparently Google CEO Sundar Pichai's cost-cutting. The Google CEO said in August that \"productivity as a whole is not where it needs to be for the headcount we have\" and warned that the company would be \"consolidating where investments overlap and streamlining processes.\" The Verge's report says, \"The Pixelbook team and the Pixelbook itself were casualties of that consolidation and redeployment.\"</p><p>Read 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

        "description": "<p>Enlarge / Galaxy brain, meet Ubisoft brain... (credit: Aurich Lawson | Getty Images | Ubisoft)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you've been following Ubisoft's relationship with the NFT space in the last year, you probably remember that its nonsensical release of Quartz NFTs in Ghost Recon Breakpoint was halted in April after just a few months. At the time, though, Ubisoft said that players should \"stay tuned for more updates with features to the platform and future drops coming with other games!\"</p>\n<p>In the months since, though, Ubisoft seems to have become less enthusiastic about its future NFT plans. In a recent group Q&amp;A following a press event at Ubisoft's Paris HQ (transcribed by GameIndustry.biz), CEO Yves Guillemot tried to clarify that the company is \"still in research mode, I would say, when it comes to NFTs.\"</p>\n<p>\"We really look at all the new technologies. We are very much on cloud, on the new generation of voxels, and we're looking at all the Web3 capabilities. We tested a few things recently that are giving us more information on how it can be used and what we should do in the universe of video games. So we are testing ground with some games, and we'll see if they really answer the players' needs.</p>\n<p>The bit about \"answering the players' needs\" is especially interesting in the wake of Ubisoft's use of NFTs in Breakpoint. In the months after Ubisoft gave away thousands of game-usable NFTs, an Ars analysis found only 96 successful secondhand sales for those in-game items on Objkt and Rarible (the only two marketplaces where such sales are allowed), with prices generally measured in the equivalent of tens of dollars. These third-party transfers were sold as one of the primary use cases for NFTs in the first place, so the lack of sales shows just how little player interest there was in Breakpoint's NFT implementation.</p><p>Read 5 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

(credit: PyTorch Foundation)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Meta AI announced today that the governance of PyTorch, a popular open source deep-learning framework, has moved to an independent organization called the PyTorch Foundation. It will operate as part of the nonprofit Linux Foundation, and its governing board includes representatives from Nvidia, Meta, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and AMD.</p>\n<p>The move comes as the PyTorch framework becomes more widely used across the deep-learning industry to power many natural-language and computer-vision projects, including Tesla Autopilot. Meta cites more than 2,400 contributors and 150,000 projects built on the framework. Spinning PyTorch off into its own foundation avoids potential conflicts of interest that might come if PyTorch were only controlled by Meta, which created the framework.</p>\n<p>\"The PyTorch Foundation will strive to adhere to four principles,\" wrote Meta in a blog post announcing the news. \"Remaining open, maintaining neutral branding, staying fair, and forging a strong technical identity. One of the foundation's main priorities is to maintain a clear separation between the business and technical governance of PyTorch.\"</p><p>Read 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

The spurs of Cavalry officers’ dress uniforms are more important for tradition’ when there are no horses, the umbrellas of Guards officers in civilian dress lose their significance when not carried tightly furled (that is, useless).”</p>\n\n\nEric Hobsbawm in The Invention of Tradition.\n\n<p>I kept thinking of this when watching the preposterous ceremonial charades surrounding the declaration of Charles as King. How many overweight, elderly white males in bejewelled and braided dresses does a country need? And how many of them need suspender belts to keep up those black tights? Also, I’ve just remembered that the new Queen Consort’s ex held the magnificent title of Silver Stick in Waiting. (I am not making this up.) Wonder what he did with his stick?</p>\n\nMusical alternative to the morning’s radio news\n<p>Planxty | The Good Ship Kangaroo</p>\n<p>Link</p>\n<p>An old (1980) recording of one of my favourite songs by Planxty, the best traditional group of my lifetime. Comes with a nice explanation of the song’s origin.</p>\n\nShort Read of the Day\n<p>Defeat by Truth is Victory</p>\n<p>Here is a touching sermon by the current President of Harvard, a hedge-fund with a nice university attached, to mark the beginning of the Fall semester.</p>\n\nBooks, etc.\n<p>Cultural Amnesia</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is one of my favourite books — the result of a lifetime’s reading and note-taking by a great cultural critic. Clive was my predecessor-but-one as the Observer’s TV critic, and indeed was the writer who made television criticism into something that could be both insightful and readable. Like me — but with much more energy — he was an autodidact and this book represents a really touching attempt to read everyone worth reading before one dies, and then trying to communicate something of the essence of each. It consists of 106 short essays on writers, artists and thinkers — from Anna Akhmatova to Stefan Zweig, taking in Walter Benjamin, Camus, Miles Davis, Fellini, Freud, de Gaulle, Hazlitt, Hegel, the Manns (Thomas, Heinrich, Michael and Golo), Proust, Sartre, Trotsky, Waugh and Wittgenstein. There are some inclusions that initially raise eyebrows — for example Hitler. Why him? Because “one of the drawbacks of liberal democracy… is the freedom to forget what once threatened its existence”.</p>\n<p>If I had a bookshelf in my bathroom, then this would be on it. Instead it sits in the study. And over the years, dipping in to it has been one of the joys of life. The first time I saw Wes Anderson’s film, The Grand Hotel Budapest, for example, I learned that it was partly inspired by the work of Stefan Zweig, about whom I had known precisely nothing. But Clive understood his significance. And now I do too.</p>\n\nWhat the Truth-Social flop says about Trump\n<p>Nice column by Jack Shafer, wondering why did only 3.9m of Trump’s 89m Twitter followers follow him to his personal Twitter-clone?</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s deranged outrage style once contained real entertainment value — which explains why moderates and liberals followed him on Twitter even if they wouldn’t vote for him. But in his post-presidency and especially in the weeks following the Mar-a-Lago search and investigation, the show has gone stale. Vainly, he has sought to top himself by sharing QAnon-related material on Truth Social, denouncing the FBI like a madman trapped in a bunker, and calling for his reinstatement as the “rightful winner“ of the 2020 election. He’s become a carnival geek biting the heads off of snakes, which can be a fabulous show the first couple of times you see it, but after that, meh. Could today’s Trump devise enough fresh outrage to produce even a brief TikTok?</p>\n\n<p>The interesting question — impossible to answer given the unreliability of US mainstream media’s coverage of politics — is whether Trump is really heading for the rocks.</p>\n\n<p>This Blog is also available as a daily email.

        "description": "Cleveland’s better-than-expected play sees them stealing the Al Central at the moment. | Matt Krohn/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The Guardians just keep sprinting, now back to three games better than predicted for the second half</p> <p>We’ve been told all season long that the White Sox have an easy second-half schedule (they do) and will play better against lesser competition. </p>\n<p>But we can’t get ahead of ourselves. The White Sox have played all season as if the division was handed to them in March, so we won’t make the same mistake here.</p>\n<p>The following is an attempt to examine how the schedule will likely play out, updated as each series finishes up, every few days. </p>\n<p>I have tried to be evenhanded with these series matchups. The logic of Chicago getting swept in San Diego is that it’s a long second leg of a trip, after a demoralizing series loss in Minnesota, with the bolstered Padres fighting to host a playoff series. The White Sox also ran out of gas by season’s end in 2020 and 2021.</p>\n<p>Will Cleveland win five of six to end 2022? That’s tough to do, but the Royals will have much earlier cashed in their season, and the Guardians get nine games at home overall to end the year.</p>\n<p>There are very few sweeps all told, so this presumes that the AL Central clubs, as bad as they are, never get too hot or too cold — until Cleveland at the end, the White Sox enjoy the hottest stretch, predicted to shoot from three games over at the end of August to 11 up heading into the home stretch.</p>\n<p>So ... do the White Sox end up with the division title? </p>\n\n<p>Heading into the second halfTwins 50-44Guardians 46-44White Sox 46-46</p>\n<p>(all series are three games unless otherwise specified)</p>\n\n<p>With 15 series in the books in the second half, the White Sox again gained a game back vs. their prediction for the second half — but remain two games worse than anticipated.</p>\n<p>And worse, Cleveland sweeping Minnesota on the road, rather than losing the three-game set, means that the Guardians gained two games vs. the prediction and now project to an 88-win season — a full five games better than both the Twins and White Sox.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Minnesota had a catastrophic series. Not much says “I’m not winning the division” than being swept in a home series against the team a couple of games in front of you. </p>\n<p>Guardians 88-74 (+ 3 vs. prediction)Twins 83-79 (- 1)White

        "description": "<p>The Fed is ready and willing to inflict damage on the U.S. economy in its fight to bring down inflation. We’ll also look at how a rail strike could hike food prices, Twitter’s continuing legal fight with Elon Musk and the potential oil price jump this winter.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, Russian President Vladimir Putin had an exceptionally bad weekend. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to On The Money, your nightly guide to everything affecting your bills, bank account and bottom line. For The Hill, we’re Sylvan Lane, Aris Folley and Karl Evers-Hillstrom. Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\nPowell: Inflation fight will 'bring some pain'\n\n\n\n<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sounded a warning to Americans last month as the central bank continues its efforts to combat high prices: The fight against inflation is going to be painful.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation. They will also bring some pain to households and businesses,” Powell said last month.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are three ways Americans could feel it.  </p>\n\n\n\nWorkers will lose power and protection: Economists expect job growth to slow and the unemployment rate to rise as businesses feel the squeeze of higher rates. That means many workers who’ve not yet gotten raises won’t get one and may have fewer other employment options with better compensation. Harder for businesses to grow and expand: Slower sales and the higher cost of borrowing money may make it difficult — if not impossible — for some firms to not only invest in their workforce, but their physical operations and the equipment they use.   Higher home payments, slower home sales: Homeowners and buyers will feel the pain of the Fed’s fight against inflation across the housing market as higher interest rates slow sales and force listing prices down. \n\n\n\n<p>Sylvan has it all here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>STRIKE LOOMS</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How a railroad strike could send food prices soaring </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nation’s supply of food could take a hit if railroad workers go on strike, driving up prices at the grocery store and limiting U.S. grain exports to countries facing famine.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As soon as next week, 115,000 freight rail workers could walk out if they cannot reach a new contract with railroads, potentially shutting down the national rail network that transports 20 percent of all grain shipments in the middle of peak harvest season.  </p>\n\n\n\nA rail shutdown would overwhelm grain storage facilities, leaving farmers with few options to store their crops and boosting the chance of spoilage, while also driving up the price of bread and other processed food. Grocery prices have risen 13.1 percent over the last year, hitting American families hard, and the food sector has blamed existing rail disruptions. Because roughly one-third of U.S. grain exports travel by rail, a work stoppage would also cut down on America’s ability to ship food to foreign nations, particularly those in East Africa and the Middle East that face widespread hunger. \n\n\n\n<p>Karl has the details here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>NO TAKE-BACKS</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter argues latest Musk move to cancel buyout deal is ‘invalid’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter in a new filing argues that Elon Musk’s latest move to back out of his agreement to buy the company for $44 billion over the company’s handling of a high-profile whistleblower is “invalid and wrongful.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter’s attorneys pushed back on Musk’s third attempt to cancel his acquisition in a regulatory document filed Monday, reiterating arguments they used in the two prior instances while stating that Twitter has “breached none of its representations or obligations” under the agreement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As was the case with each of your prior purported terminations, the Musk Parties third purported termination is invalid for the independent reason that Mr. Musk and the other Musk Parties continue to knowingly, intentionally, willfully, and materially breach the Agreement,” they wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hill’s Rebecca Klar walks us through it here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>PUMP JUMP</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yellen says Russia could force gas prices higher in winter </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Sunday warned that gas prices may spike again this winter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yellen told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” that gas prices could rise due to the European Union largely halting Russian oil purchases this winter and banning provision of services that allow Russia to ship oil by tanker. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Yellen noted a western price cap proposal was designed to balance curbing Russian oil revenues helping fund its war in Ukraine, while maintaining some access to Russian oil to “hold down global oil prices.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So I believe this is something that can be essential,” she said. “And it’s something that we’re trying to put in place to avoid a future spike in oil prices.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\nGood to Know\n\n\n\n<p>President Biden on Monday bemoaned the state of U.S. airports as he touted the ways a bipartisan infrastructure law passed last year would help upgrade terminals, improve the passenger experience and reduce emissions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden traveled to Boston to highlight a $62 million investment in Logan Airport through the infrastructure law. The funding will be used to modernize the international terminal of the airport and to improve roadways that keep planes circulating. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what else we have our eye on: </p>\n\n\n\nSenate Democrats’ campaign arm released a new ad on Monday attacking Arizona Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters’s comments about Social Security during a primary debate in June. The Biden administration next month will place new restrictions on U.S. shipments of semiconductor chips and chipmaking equipment to China. \n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it for today.

        "description": "<p>Vice President Harris on Monday said it was \"not by accident, but probably by design\" that the same \"sources\" who threaten abortion rights also work against voting rights and LGBTQ rights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris made the remarks at a meeting she convened with civil rights and abortion rights activists. Attendees included Rev. Al Sharpton, Planned Parenthood CEO Alexis McGill Johnson and Center for Reproductive Rights CEO Nancy Northup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Certainly we know that with the Supreme Court having made the decision in Dobbs to take a constitutional right — that had been recognized — from the people of America, from the women of America has created a health care crisis in America,\" Harris said, referring to the June Supreme Court ruling striking down federal abortion protections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I also want to mention that it is certainly, we think, not by accident, but probably by design that we are seeing from some of the same sources attacks on women's health rights, voting rights, LGBTQ rights. And so we stand here in full acknowledgement of what has taken place in our country,\" Harris added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris has taken on the role within the Biden administration of pushing back against threats to abortion rights since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her assertion that the Supreme Court caused a \"health care crisis in America\" comes just days after she made more pointed remarks about the highest court in the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris referred to the Supreme Court as an \"activist court\" during an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" last week, adding that the court's decision to overturn Roe caused her \"great concern about the integrity of the Court overall.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reproductive rights leaders who gathered on Monday echoed Harris's sentiments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Tens of millions of women. trans men and nonbinary people cannot access the care they need in their communities. And those that are most affected are those who are already facing barriers to care: Black, Latinx, Indigenous communities, rural communities, immigrant communities,\" McGill Johnson from Planned Parenthood said at the meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Melanie Campbell, CEO of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, noted that courts had historically been places where Black women were able to achieve justice when laws failed them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Unfortunately, we are in a perilous chapter in our nation where too many of our courts have been turned into instruments for partisan gain, all with the aim of reserving power for a select few,\" Campbell said. \"Today we find ourselves in this moment where the highest court in the land is stripping away our constitutional rights and freedoms.\"</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3639503-addiction-often-goes-hand-in-hand-with-mental-illnesses-both-must-be-addressed/",
        "description": "<p>Natalie struggled with a methamphetamine use disorder for more than nine years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was one of the fortunate few to receive treatment to address her addiction, yet that help felt incomplete. Like many people trying to heal from substance use disorders, she eventually began taking meth again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, Natalie was diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common mental disorders in youth. She started ADHD treatment in addition to treatment for her meth addiction, and it made her long-term recovery a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The addition of Adderall really changed my life,” she said. “Looking back, it makes sense that I was self-medicating ADHD that was undiagnosed. I found it very discouraging that a lot of people got their lives in order while I struggled to function with everyday tasks. In part, that is what led to my relapse.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recovering from drug addiction is notoriously difficult. Setbacks are common. Too often, a critical element is overlooked: co-occurring mental health conditions. Treating mental illnesses like depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, ADHD, and others with medications or other therapies is crucial to address the addiction and overdose crisis that now claims over 100,000 lives annually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Substance use disorders often accompany other mental illnesses. Half of people with a substance use disorder have another mental illness at some point, and vice-versa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many people, drug and alcohol problems begin as self-medication: using substances to cope with temporary stress or to manage symptoms of chronic mental health problems they may not even know they have. Substance use, particularly alcohol, can be a socially accepted way of dealing with negative emotions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surveys show alcohol use rose during the COVID-19 pandemic, including increased use by stressed parents. Research has also tied problem alcohol use in college students to self-treatment of social anxiety. Similarly, people with untreated depression might discover that opioids or stimulants temporarily boost their mood and use them for that purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fragmented and hard-to-access mental health care means that these conditions and addiction often go untreated. In some communities, it is easier to get illicit drugs than adequate medical mental health care, making co-occurring addiction and other mental illness more likely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But using substances to treat mental illness can begin a difficult cycle.  Substance use to manage mental illness can lead to addiction and can in turn worsen the original mental illness. Regularly taking drugs or alcohol causes the brain to adapt to that substance—known as dependence. Effectively, the brain dials down its own neurotransmitter systems upon which the drugs act. A person trying to relieve anxiety through substance use will feel worse anxiety most of the time, because their brain now depends on the drug for relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Racism and other forms of discrimination, isolation, childhood trauma, poverty and lack of access to education and health care can all play a role in increasing risk of developing mental illness and substance use disorders. The stigma that attaches to both substance use disorders and mental illness exacerbates these factors—making the person with mental illness and addiction even more isolated and vulnerable, and less likely to seek treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entanglement of mental illness and substance use disorders requires urgent action. Efforts to reverse the addiction and overdose crisis need to be multifaceted, taking mental illness into account. We have powerful, proven treatment tools for addiction, especially for opioid use disorder. Harm reduction strategies, when implemented, can staunch overdose deaths. But expanded screening and care for mental illnesses including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and others must be a component to successfully address the current addiction and overdose crises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prevention is possible if investments are made. Opportunities to reduce risk can begin early in life, since substance use disorders and other mental illnesses share common risk and protective factors. Interventions starting during the prenatal period and followed through adolescence and young adulthood can help avert a range of adverse outcomes later in life. Moreover, numerous studies of prevention’s return on investment show that communities could not only save lives but also money by investing in prevention programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Screening is equally important. Earlier this year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended that primary care physicians screen all adult and adolescent patients for depression, given its low cost and potential for benefit. Screening for mental health conditions needs to become part of standard practice along with screening for substance use and substance use disorders to personalize interventions to treat patients’ unique needs and increase the likelihood of recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Nora Volkow is director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health.

        "description": "<p>House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) on Monday suggested that Congress would move to stop a rail strike “if needed,” as the possibility of a walkout of freight rail workers remains possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to 15,000 rail workers could go on strike as soon as this week if union leaders are unable to agree on a new contract with railroads, which would shutter operations throughout a major national rail network that moves one-fifth of all grain shipments. The strike, if it occurs, would have a significant effect on the U.S. economy, throwing the supply chain off balance and driving up the price of bread and other goods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rail workers can strike on Friday, when a cooling-off period expires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Congress does, however, have the ability to step in and block the strike — which Hoyer says is a possibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There is a role for Congress if in fact they fail to reach an agreement,” Hoyer told Bloomberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Obviously a railroad strike at this point in time would be extraordinary detrimental to our economy and the American people. And we want to avoid that. The president has certain authorities that he can exercise. The Congress can also pass legislation. We are very focused on this and we want to avoid a crippling railroad strike,” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority leader said he is “hopeful” that the remaining unions can reach an agreement, but noted that Congress “can pass legislation as well if needed.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“But we want to avoid a railroad strike. We want to resolve these differences,” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten of the 12 unions have struck deals on a contract, according to Bloomberg. The remaining two — the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the International Association of Sheet Metal Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers — make up 90,000 employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The potential strike has been top of mind for some Biden administration officials. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh was scheduled to travel to Ireland on Monday, but put off the trip to stay in the U.S. and assist with the situation, according to Politico Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The parties continue to negotiate, and last night Secretary Walsh again engaged to push the parties to reach a resolution that averts any shutdown of our rail system,” a Labor Department spokesperson told the outlet on Sunday. “This followed on dozens of calls from the President’s Cabinet and top Administration officials, and months of Administration efforts.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amtrak is already making plans for the possible walkout — the company on Monday said it is implementing “phased adjustments” to prepare for the possible “interruption.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Amtrak is closely monitoring the ongoing freight rail -- rail labor contract negotiations. The negotiations do not involve Amtrak or the Amtrak workforce. While we are hopeful that parties will reach a resolution, Amtrak has now begun phased adjustments to our service in preparation for a possible freight rail service interruption later this week,” Amtrak said in a statement, according to CNN.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Spare a thought for the people of Stow, Mass: They no longer have a Dunkin’Donuts in the town, and now have to drive as far as a mile and a half for theirmedium \"regulah.\"  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Biden on Monday delivered a speech to promote his “cancer moonshot” initiative to end cancer reminiscent of former President John F. Kennedy’s push to reach the moon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to Overnight Health Care, where we’re following the latest moves on policy and news affecting your health. For The Hill, we’re Nathaniel Weixel and Joseph Choi. Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\nBiden pitches ‘cancer moonshot’ as bipartisan pursuit\n\n\n\n<p>President Biden on Monday channeled John F. Kennedy in an effort to rally the country behind the administration’s Cancer Moonshot, an effort to \"end cancer as we know it.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The moonshot has a goal of cutting cancer deaths by at least 50 percent in the next 25 years. </p>\n\n\n\n“Cancer does not discriminate red and blue, it doesn’t care if you’re Republican or a Democrat. Beating cancer is something we can do together and that’s why I’m here today,” the president said at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston. “Unwilling to postpone, President Kennedy set a goal to win the space race against Russia and advance science and technology for all of humanity,” he said. \n\n\n\n<p>His speech was delivered on the 60th anniversary of Kennedy’s “moonshot” speech at Rice University in Houston, during which he outlined his plan for the U.S. to become an international leader in space exploration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Together, we can choose to move forward with unity, hope, and optimism. And I believe we can usher in the same unwillingness to postpone, the same national purpose that will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills. To end cancer as we know it and even cure cancers once and for all,” Biden said Monday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initiative, which he relaunched in February, aims to cut the cancer death rate in half over the next 25 years and improve the lives of caregivers and cancer survivors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\nDems seek opportunity with ObamaCare court ruling \n\n\n\n<p>Democrats are seizing on a federal judge’s ruling against ObamaCare’s prevention coverage as an opportunity to campaign on preserving health care just two months before the midterm elections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ruling last week by Judge Reed O’Connor in Texas escalates another battle over ObamaCare and could jeopardize access to preventive care for millions of Americans, including screenings for colorectal and other cancer, depression and hypertension, among many other services. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running on saving the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has proven effective for Democrats in the past: The party used the GOP’s attempt to repeal the law in 2017 to mount a successful campaign in 2018 to take control of the House.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year, the Supreme Court’s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade gave Democrats another health issue with which to galvanize their base — and now it appears they’re looking to build on that strategy with O’Connor’s ruling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“With the GOP’s utter disdain for our health, safety and freedom, it is only a matter of time that another drug, treatment, vaccine or health service becomes the next target of their extremism,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement shortly after the ruling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE SEES JUMP IN CALLS, TEXTS </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Americans are reaching out to the national 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline more than a month after the new three-digit hotline number went live.   </p>\n\n\n\nThe 988 lifeline received 413,425 contacts during the month of August, through phone calls, online chat messages and text messages. That’s a 45 percent increase in overall volume compared to August 2021 and about a 2 percent increase from July 2022, according to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Calls and text messages in August exceeded July metrics, except for online chats, which were at about 75,000 in July 2022.   \n\n\n\n<p>“We want everyone to know that there is hope. Whether you’re experiencing thoughts of suicide, a mental health or substance use crisis, or any other emotional distress, there is compassionate, accessible care and support,” Miriam E. Delphin-Rittmon, HHS assistant secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, said in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suicide rates have been growing in the U.S., with nearly half a million lives lost to suicide from 2010 to 2020. During the same period, the suicide death rate increased by 12 percent, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>CONCERNS ABOUT COVID EXPOSURE AT WORK STEADY SINCE LAST FALL</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A third of employed adults are concerned about exposure to COVID-19 at work, a figure that is relatively unchanged since the fall last year, according to a new Gallup poll. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Negligible shift: The new survey found only a 3-point drop from November 2021, when 36 percent of workers expressed at least moderate concern for exposure to COVID-19 at work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The percentage has fallen, however, from the first six months of the pandemic in 2020. Roughly half of respondents were uneasy about exposure at work at the time, while the percentage of those saying they are “not concerned at all” has grown from 23 percent in 2020 to a record high of 39 percent in the latest polling. </p>\n\n\n\nExposure concerns did not significantly vary by age, but the new survey did find a substantial gender gap. The poll was conducted before Americans started receiving booster shots designed to target omicron variants.  \n\n\n\n<p>Read more here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\nFDA sets meeting on OTC birth control pill application\n\n\n\n<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has scheduled a joint meeting to discuss pharmaceutical company Perrigo’s application for what could be the first over-the-counter (OTC) daily birth control pill available in the U.S., the company announced Monday. </p>\n\n\n\nThe joint meeting will be held on Nov. 18 with the FDA’s Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee and the Obstetrics, Reproductive, and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee, according to Perrigo. If approved by the FDA, Perrigo’s progestin-only daily pill would be the first non-prescription birth control pill available in the U.S. Perrigo filed its application to move its birth control pill from prescription to OTC in July. \n\n\n\n<p>International norms: Many countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa already allow for OTC birth control pills to be sold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perrigo filed its application just weeks after the Supreme Court overturnedRoe v. Wade, leading to several states in the U.S. enacting total or near-total abortion bans. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’s concurring opinion sparked concerns that protected access to contraceptives could also be overturned. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WHAT WE'RE READING</p>\n\n\n\nSo you haven't caught COVID yet.

        "description": "<p>Not even the Pentagon expected Ukraine’s blitzkrieg to move so quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top Western defense officials were informed in advance that Ukraine was planning a two-front counteroffensive to retake territory captured by Russia, but they have been surprised by the blistering pace of Kyiv’s gains in the north, according to four officials with knowledge of the discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian forces rolled through lightly manned Russian posts around Kharkiv over the weekend, retaking more than 1,000 square miles around the city and pushing east — in some cases all the way up to the Russian border. Russian forces retreated from two key logistical hubs, the towns of Izyum and Kupiansk, as their ranks were depleted by the simultaneous fight in Kherson in the south.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyiv informed top U.S. generals in advance of the plan to launch simultaneous attacks on two fronts, according to a Ukrainian official, but both governments were shocked by the success of the northern counteroffensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Everyone was surprised how the Russians ran,” said the Ukrainian government official on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive operation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The northern offensive has been conducted by a relatively small force — just a handful of brigades with a few thousand soldiers each, according to a U.S. official and a Western diplomat. Many of the Russian outposts were manned by conscripts and lightly trained and armed troops from occupied areas of Ukraine who were overwhelmed by the firepower and armored vehicles of the approaching forces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scale and pace of the Ukrainian advance was fueled by Western arms shipments, particularly precision rocket launchers and artillery shells provided by the U.S. that battered Russian forces in advance of ground movements and targeted their ammunition dumps and command-and-control facilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also key were U.S.-made counter-battery radars that allow the Ukrainians to precisely locate and target Russian artillery pieces within minutes of their firing salvos, and a grab bag of heavily armored vehicles donated by the U.S., U.K., Australia, and others that are allowing the attackers to close with Russian forces quickly, and in relative safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ukrainian push to retake ground all but wiped out the hard-fought gains made by Kremlin forces this spring, including the city of Izyum, which the Russians seized in April after weeks of bloody fighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian forces raised the national flag over the battered city this weekend after Russian troops fled in disarray. Ukrainian government officials have estimated that 80 percent of the buildings in the town of 40,000 had been destroyed in the fighting this spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the retreating Russian forces have moved over the border into Russia, a senior military official said Monday. There have been reports of Russians abandoning military equipment, which could be indicative of Moscow’s “disorganized command and control,” the official said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. has long provided Ukraine with a host of intelligence about the battlefield, from satellite imagery and other sources, which Kyiv uses to make decisions on targeting and troop movements, two U.S. officials said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We certainly provide them with information on conditions, but in the end, this is a Ukrainian choice,” a senior Defense Department official told reporters on Monday. “The Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian political leadership made the decisions on how to conduct this counter offensive.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Western officials are now closely watching how far into the Donbas the northern offensive will get. The Ukrainians may be able to continue their push using new stockpiles of ammunition, vehicles and tanks the Russians left behind as they fled using civilian vehicles and whatever else they could pile in as the rout intensified, the U.S. official said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I would look to whether Ukraine can further exploit the momentum they have developed in the Donbas,” said Michael Kofman of the CNA think tank. “Russian forces are likely to try and reconstitute after retreat, and attempt localized counter-attacks.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the two sides continue to clash around Kherson in the south, where Ukraine is likely to increase pressure in an attempt to sever Russia’s land corridor from the Donbas to Crimea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The current period is best described as a window of opportunity for Ukraine, seizing the initiative to not just take territory, but also deal blows to the Russian military from which they will struggle to recover during the winter,” Kofman said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The swift gains made by the Ukrainians come at an uncertain moment for Western support. On Monday, the German government again refused to allow countries that have purchased German-made Leopard tanks to transfer them to Kyiv. German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said “no country has delivered Western-built infantry fighting vehicles or main battle tanks so far,” and Berlin “will not take such action unilaterally.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Germany has come under intense criticism for refusing requests from a number of countries to transfer domestically produced military equipment to Ukraine, including howitzer cannons and armored vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Washington, the Biden administration is running up against the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30 and with it the need for Congress to pass a new $13.7 billion Ukraine military and humanitarian aid package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Biden administration announced a $675 million drawdown of munitions and armored vehicles last week, and a congressional aide familiar with the issue said there will likely be another package announced as soon as this week for roughly $600 million more of similar equipment pulled by U.S. stockpiles, since DoD officials notified Congress recently that it would use $1.3 billion in drawdown authority in September.</p>",

Floral Tribute, which has been distributed by Armitage’s publisher, Faber, is a double acrostic, with two verses consisting of nine lines, the first letters of which spell Elizabeth, a nod perhaps to funeral floral arrangements that spell out the deceased person’s name.</p><p>The poet directly references himself in the first verse: “I have conjured a lily to light these hours, a token of thanks.” Armitage thanks the Queen for her gift of “a promise made and kept for life” and offers his poem as “a gift in return”.</p><p>Wisdom who, with power infinite,Utterest death to every creature born,Grant to us now the mercy of Thy light,With comfort to beloved Queens who mourn.</p> Continue reading...",

Floral Tribute, which has been distributed by Armitage’s publisher, Faber, is a double acrostic, with two verses consisting of nine lines, the first letters of which spell Elizabeth, a nod perhaps to funeral floral arrangements that spell out the deceased person’s name.</p><p>The poet directly references himself in the first verse: “I have conjured a lily to light these hours, a token of thanks.” Armitage thanks the Queen for her gift of “a promise made and kept for life” and offers his poem as “a gift in return”.</p><p>Wisdom who, with power infinite,Utterest death to every creature born,Grant to us now the mercy of Thy light,With comfort to beloved Queens who mourn.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p>Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said in an interview that a report about former President Trump insisting that he would stay in the White House after losing the 2020 election “affirms the reality of the danger” of trying to overturn its results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new book to be published next month by New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman reportedly reveals that Trump told aides he would remain in the White House after President Biden’s inauguration, CNN reported early Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I'm just not going to leave,” Trump reportedly told an aide. “We’re never leaving. How can you leave when you won an election?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about the book's revelation, Cheney said she wasn't surprised by Trump's reported comments but said it exposed an issue of people believing his efforts to overturn the election \"wasn't as dangerous as it really was.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"And when you hear something like that, I think you have to recognize that we were in no man's land and territory we'd never been in before as a nation,\" Cheney told anchor Jake Tapper in an interview set to air Sunday evening as part of a CNN documentary titled \"American Coup: The January 6th Investigation.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And if you have a president who's refusing to leave the White House, or who's saying he refuses to leave the White House, then anyone who sort of stands aside and says someone else will handle it is themselves putting the nation at risk, because it's clear that, when you're at a moment that we faced, everyone's got to stand up and take responsibility,” Cheney said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It's not surprising that those are the sentiments that he reportedly expressed,” Cheney added. “I think, again, it just affirms — affirms the reality of the danger.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cheney, who lost her bid to retain her congressional seat in Wyoming last month, has been a frequent critic of Trump and is the co-chairwoman of the House select committee investigating the Jan 6., 2021, attack at the Capitol. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Ukraine’s battleground offensive over the weekend made major headway and clawed back thousands of miles of territory once lost to Russian forces, a development that is causing issues for Russian President Vladimir Putin at home and abroad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll break down the most recent Ukrainian gains and what that means for both Kyiv and Moscow, plus the stark new figure for the number of civilians killed during the conflict, the latest in the Department of Justices’ review of classified materials taken from Mar-a-Lago, and how President Biden shifted the war on terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is Defense &amp; National Security, your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. For The Hill, I’m Ellen Mitchell. Subscribe here.</p>\n\n\n\nUkraine’s successful offensive bad news for Putin \n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine’s battleground offensive that has seen it gain thousands of miles of territory once lost to Moscow spells bad news for Russian President Vladimir Putin at home and abroad.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ukrainian’s performance has amplified dissent in Russia, strengthened President Biden’s hand in rallying support for the country, opened up new opportunities for Kyiv and is expected to make it harder for Russia to find support from its allies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Counteroffensive: “Clearly they’re fighting hard,” a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Monday of the Ukrainian troops, noting that Russian forces have “largely ceded their gains to the Ukrainians” in the vicinity of Kharkiv province with “many” of the Russian forces moving back over the border into Russia.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ukrainian military last week began a counteroffensive that quickly reclaimed territory and pushed Russian troops back to the northeastern border of the country in some places. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Promising results: The lightning advance forced thousands of Kremlin troops to make a quick retreat, leaving behind ammunition stockpiles and equipment, reports of abandonment which could be “indicative of Russia’s disorganized command and control,” the defense official said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his forces had recaptured 6,000 square kilometers of land in the east and south of Ukraine since the start of September. Included in the towns reclaimed was Izium, a key city in the fight.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A possible turning point: The loss of Izium marks Russia’s worst military defeat since March, when its troops were unable to take the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and were forced back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Ukraine, the rapid advance could be a turning point in the 6-month-old war that moves the fighting out of a battle of attrition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read the rest of the story here </p>\n\n\n\n<p>MORE THAN 5,800 CIVILIANS KILLED IN RUSSIAN INVASION  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly 100 civilians have been killed in Ukraine so far this month, bringing the total civilian death count to nearly 6,000 since the war began, according to a new United Nations (U.N.) report on the war. </p>\n\n\n\nThe U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights released a report Monday detailing 5,827 civilians killed and another 8,421 injured in the conflict between Feb. 24 and Sept. 11. This month alone, the U.N. mission recorded 96 Ukrainians killed and another 266 injured.  \n\n\n\n<p>The actual numbers are likely “considerably higher,” according to the report, as information is hard to come by and verify in conflict-wracked areas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read that story here </p>\n\n\n\nTrump pushes to keep blocking DOJ access to docs\n\n\n\n<p>Former President Trump is fighting a request from the Department of Justice (DOJ) to allow its review of classified materials taken from Mar-a-Lago to continue, with Trump’s legal team arguing the investigation “at its core is a document storage dispute that has spiraled out of control.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filing continues to assert the former president has broad power to control his records even after he leaves office, even the classified records that the Justice Department argued Trump can have no possible claim to, and thus do not require review by a third-party special master. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump team’s argument’: In the filing, Trump’s legal team pushed back against the idea that there was any possible damage from the mishandling of records. </p>\n\n\n\n“There is no indication any purported ‘classified records’ were disclosed to anyone. Indeed, it appears such ‘classified records,’ along with the other seized materials, were principally located in storage boxes in a locked room at Mar-a-Lago, a secure, controlled access compound utilized regularly to conduct the official business of the United States during the Trump Presidency, which to this day is monitored by the United States Secret Service,” they wrote. \n\n\n\n<p>Timing: The response from Trump’s team came after the Justice Department last Thursday indicated it planned to appeal a federal district court judge’s ruling green-lighting a special master, also asking her to approve a partial stay that would exclude some 300 classified records from their review. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At issue: “The classification markings establish on the face of the documents that they are government records, not Plaintiff’s personal records,” the DOJ wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And for several reasons, no potential assertion of executive privilege could justify restricting the executive branch’s review and use of the classified records at issue here.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Trump’s team claimed Monday that classification status matters little within the Presidential Records Act (PRA) and that Trump’s document issues should be sorted with the National Archives. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read the full story here </p>\n\n\n\nHow Biden has shifted the war on terror\n\n\n\n<p>More than 20 years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President Biden has shifted the way America fights the war on terror by launching fewer drone strikes, embracing an over-the-horizon approach to killing terrorists in Afghanistan and leveraging alliances.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following last year’s pullout of U.S. forces from Afghanistan — ending a war that the 9/11 attacks tipped off — Biden has placed more emphasis on working with and through allies to target both new and long-standing foreign terrorist groups.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Biden is also prioritizing keeping a light footprint abroad, including by using drones and special forces. This marks a major shift from the large numbers of American service members sent overseas to fight the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, as well as to far-flung locations including Syria and Somalia.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as the Biden administration pushes forward with its counterterrorism strategy, it will have to balance its efforts to combat foreign terrorists with addressing the threat of domestic extremism, experts say. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read that story here </p>\n\n\n\n<p>ON TAP FOR TOMORROW</p>\n\n\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee will hold a hearing on the nomination of Lt.

        "description": "Following Resignation of Joyce Jacobsen, Gearan Returns as President\n<p> </p>\nFive years after leaving HWS for Harvard, President Emeritus Mark D. Gearan L.H.D. ’17, P’21 returns to HWS\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>President Mark Gearan</p>\n<p>The Hobart and William Smith Colleges Board of Trustees has announced the selection of President Emeritus Mark D. Gearan L.H.D. ’17, P’21 as the 30th president of Hobart and the 19th of William Smith.</p>\n\nGearan takes on the role following the resignation of President Joyce P. Jacobsen who presided over HWS from 2019-2022, engineering a period of exceptional innovation at the Colleges. Jacobsen will join the faculty at HWS as professor of economics.Gearan previously was president of Hobart and William Smith from 1999-2017 and during that time the Colleges’ endowment doubled as he oversaw a capital campaign that raised $205 million to support facilities and annual giving, established 168 new scholarships, and completed 80 significant capital projects. During his first presidency, Gearan made substantial commitments to diversity and inclusion, propelled the Colleges’ environmental efforts, and grew programming in career services, civic engagement, leadership, student services and study abroad.\n<p> </p>\n\nAfter leaving Hobart and William Smith in 2017, Gearan served as President in Residence at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and in 2018 was appointed Director of the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\n“There is no one more qualified to lead Hobart and William Smith into our next 200 years than Mark,” wrote Chair of the Board Craig R. Stine ’81, P’17 and Vice Chair Cassandra Naylor Brooks ’89 in a letter to the HWS community. “He has the experience, aptitude, passion and creativity to make a tremendous difference, and is committed to our future.”A former Director of the Peace Corps [from September 26, 1995 to August 11, 1999].\n<p> </p>\n\nGearan is known nationally for his work on higher education and national service, and recently served as Vice Chair of the National Commission on Military, National and Public Service created by the U.S. Congress. A cum laude graduate of Harvard College and Georgetown University Law Center, he holds 13 honorary degrees.\n<p> </p>\n\nGearan will return to Geneva with his wife, Mary Herlihy Gearan L.H.D. ’17, P’21, who was active in the Geneva community during their previous service and has continued to serve on the Board of Happiness House, Finger Lakes Cerebral Palsy Association. At Harvard, she received the John R. Marquand Award recognizing excellence and dedication in the mentoring and guidance of Harvard undergraduates. At Harvard, the Gearans served as Interim Faculty Deans at Winthrop House, one of 12 undergraduate houses on campus. They have two daughters, Madeleine and Kathleen ’21.“Mark Gearan is an exceptional leader with a deep commitment to the faculty, students and staff who make possible the transformational mission of colleges and universities,” says Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow. “That commitment is grounded in a steadfast belief in the power of public service. At the Institute of Politics, as he has throughout his career, Mark helped students find a deeper connection to participative democracy, to service and to public purpose. We are grateful to Mark for his service to Harvard and wish him well as he takes up the presidency of Hobart and William Smith at such an important time.”“Under Mark Gearan’s leadership during the past four years, the Institute of Politics has been both an integral part of Harvard Kennedy School and one of the largest student organizations for undergraduates in Harvard College,” Douglas W. Elmendorf, Dean and Don K. Price Professor of Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School, said in a statement to the School’s faculty and staff. “The IOP has hosted interesting and varied speakers in the Forum and elsewhere, placed more than a hundred students per year in summer internships, played a key role in the Harvard Votes Challenge to strengthen democracy, convened new mayors and new Members of Congress, supported a large collection of student programs, and so much more…. I am very grateful to Mark for all he has done for the Harvard community and for the broader world…. I offer him my best wishes.”“Mark Gearan is one of the finest higher education leaders in the nation,” says Rakesh Khurana, Danoff Dean of Harvard College. “Extraordinarily wise and unfailingly kind, Mark leads with his head and heart.  Among his numerous talents is his ability to bring people of different perspectives and voices together to solve challenging problems.  At Harvard, Mark and Mary were extraordinary faculty deans and community citizens.  It’s a testament to Mark and Mary and the wisdom of Hobart and William Smith Colleges that the Gearans are welcomed home again.”“I am grateful to the Board of Trustees for entrusting me with this responsibility, to our alumni, alumnae, parents and the Geneva community who are committed to the Colleges’ future, and to the faculty, staff, coaches and students who are the heart of the institution and who work so hard to create an outstanding teaching and learning environment,” says Gearan. “Most especially, I am sincerely appreciative of President Joyce Jacobsen who has led the Colleges through a very challenging time in American higher education, and who has done so with vision, intelligence and empathy.”“I had a highly effective and productive partnership with Joyce and look forward to celebrating her many accomplishments,” says Stine. “We have been very fortunate to benefit from her leadership that resulted in record-breaking fundraising years, an impressive array of new masters and undergraduate programs, and new athletics opportunities. Joyce dedicated herself wholly to her work while also maintaining an aggressive schedule of research and writing, including teaching a class on campus in the spring. The Board is pleased that she will remain in our community as a valued faculty member.”\n\nJacobsen is the first woman to serve as president of Hobart and William Smith. Previously the Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs at Wesleyan University, she is a renowned scholar of economics, an award-winning teacher and a skilled administrator with more than three decades of experience. She is the recipient of the prestigious 2021 Carolyn Shaw Bell Award, given to an individual who has furthered the status of women in the economics profession. She earned her Ph.D. from Stanford University and M.Sc. from the London School of Economics, and graduated from Harvard University, magna cum laude, with her A.B. in economics as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. An expert on labor economics, particularly the economics of gender, Jacobsen is the author of scores of journal articles and book chapters, as well as several books.",

        "description": "To Preserve and to Learn\nOne Morning in September\nby Edwin Jorge (Jamaica 1979–81)\n<p> </p>\n<p>Edwin Jorge was the Regional Manager of the New York Peace Corps Office and was at work in Building # 6 of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. The building was destroyed when the North Tower collapsed. At a  commemoration service held at Headquarters in Peace Corps/Washington a year after the attack, Edwin spoke about what happened to the Peace Corps Office. His comments follow.</p>\n<p>ONE YEAR AGO TODAY, on the morning of September 11, 2001, I sat down at my office desk and turned on my computer. As the computer booted to life, I glanced up and looked out of the windows of my office on the sixth floor of the Customs House in the heart of the financial district of New York. From where I sat, I could see the corner of Tower One of the World Trade Center. I could glance across the street and see Building Seven of the World Trade Center, where New York City had its Emergency Center, and where the CIA offices were located. Since becoming Regional Manager of the New York Peace Corps Office, I always thought it was odd that our agency would be located there, at the very center of the financial world. I remember taking a sip of coffee. That moment and what I was thinking has stayed with me because it was the last moment in my life when everything was normal. And then the first of the two planes hit the Tower.</p>\n<p>I knew it was a plane. And I knew we had been hit. Having served in the army as a Green Beret before joining the Peace Corps, I knew something was serious wrong and we were all in trouble.</p>\n<p>It was 8:46 a.m. in the office and while we often have as many as twenty working out of the suite of offices, there were only two recruiters with me: Seetha Madhavan (Kyrgyz Republic 1998–00) and Doug Miller (Thailand 1990–92).</p>\n<p>When the plane hit — and we had no doubt that it did hit the Tower — the whole building shook and immediately scraps of metal, glass, and parts of the plane sailed down passed my windows crashing onto the street below. I glanced out of the window and watched people fleeing from the wreckage.</p>\n<p>“A bomb?” Doug asked, rushing to my office.</p>\n<p>“No,” I said. “It’s a plane. Let’s go.”</p>\n<p>We left the sixth floor by the stairwell and with others from the floor made it down to the glass entrance of the Customs House that opened onto the wide and beautiful plaza of the Trade Center.</p>\n<p>I glanced out through the wide glass doors and the floor to ceiling windows. Nothing in my military experience had prepared me for what I saw — a swath of destruction had already fallen upon the Trade Center. Still, irrationally, I kept thinking: “I’m safe. I’m safe.” But with each step, the scene became much more horrific.</p>\n<p>Already on the plaza I could see shapes of fallen bodies, the first victims of 9/11, chunks of metal from the plane, office furniture, showers of paperwork, and in the air, the smell of burning jet fuel.</p>\n<p>With everyone else, the two recruiters and I turned from the plaza and moved quickly across the bridge to the Financial Center, then out through the Winter Garden onto the open courtyard that fronted the Hudson River. Looking up, I saw the gapping hole of where the plane had smashed into Tower 2. High above this gaping hole, tragic souls were leaping from the burning tower to their death.</p>\n<p>But even then, even as I stood staring up at this towering inferno, I had every expectation of returning to the office that day. I turned with the others to search for a telephone to call my family, to tell those closest to me that I was okay, that I was alive, that everything was going to be okay.</p>\n<p>Not until the second plane hit did I begin to realize the magnitude of what was happening to our city and country. Now I stood in the midst of total chaos – rushing crowds, people desperate to get away, to find a working phone, to find each other.</p>\n<p>Still, I couldn’t get my family off my mind. My mother. My six year old daughter. It would take me hours before I could get in touch with them and by then they thought that I was among the ones who had perished. For my mother I was reborn on that day.</p>\n<p>I HAVE NO CLEAR RECOLLECTION of what happened next, or in what order. What comes back to me now are bits and pieces of the day. I remember most how suddenly all New Yorkers began to work together as a family. Strangers gave each other their working cell phones to make calls, others shared bottles of water, I saw a woman in high heel standing in the middle of an intersection directing traffic, cab drivers stopping to fill their taxis with those who needed a ride.</p>\n<p>It took me most of the day to reach my home in Queens, having walked across the city. A cab driver stopped at one point and get me a lift for the last several miles out of lower Manhattan. It was only then, safe in my apartment that I realized what had happened. But even then I didn’t know what to do.</p>\n<p>I got a call from John Coyne (Ethiopia 1962-64) who had been the Manager of the New York Regional Office before me and he gave me the phone numbers of Peace Corps Washington and told me to call, to let them know that all the recruiters and staff were okay. I did make the call, but weeks later when we talked about that day, I didn’t remember him calling, or giving me the phone numbers at Peace Corps HQ.</p>\n<p>I DO REMEMBER THE NEXT DAY. On the 12th, I got a call from Chuck Baquet, then the Deputy Director of the Peace Corps. What I remember most is what he said to me that morning. He said, “Edwin, we can’t let this get to us. We can’t let them win. We need you to get your office back up and running in two weeks.”</p>\n<p>Sure, I told him. “Sure, Chuck, I can do that.”</p>\n<p>And when I hung up, I thought: “How am I going to do that?”</p>\n<p>Not only was I still in shock, but the whole city was. My staff was scattered over four states. I couldn’t get in touch with anyone. Our building — World Trade Center # 6, the Customs House — had been crushed when Tower 1 collapsed. Everything was lost. All our files, our computers, the phones and personal effects.</p>\n<p>And the city was a logistical nightmare. The trains were barely running. Utilities downtown were a mess. 15 million square feet of office space had just evaporated into a giant cloud of gray dust. And I had just told the Deputy Director that I could get the New York Regional Office up and running in two weeks.</p>\n<p>But the great thing about Chuck’s request was that it focused my life. It gave me direction at a time when I was preoccupied with my mortality. It reminded me, most of all, that the job we do — getting Peace Corps Volunteers into the field — was never more important than it was after September 11.</p>\n<p>At the time of the attack, our office had over 300 new application in our files. It would have been easy to become overwhelmed by the task of rebuilding those files, but we couldn’t do that. Those 300 Americans wanted to become Peace Corps Volunteers. We couldn’t let them down.</p>\n<p>And we didn’t. Through the hard work of many people in my office, and with the support of Peace Corps Headquarters, we were able to get back on our feet in what I now realize was a remarkably short time.</p>\n<p>I began by calling a friend who found us temporary office space in a building he owned. We moved in within days of the attack. Then against all odds, I was able to find permanent space in a building not far from where our office had been. In less than two months, the New York Office was up and running. The recruiters were making new nominations by November.</p>\n<p>But doing everything was its own nightmare. To get our mail, I stood on line at the post office for hours at a time, trying to find what had happened to it.</p>\n<p>But through it all, the support we got was tremendous. I had 55 messages on my answering machine the first night of the attack, and for weeks, I had emails from people around the globe asking about us, wishing us well. Most important was the help and assistance I got from Peace Corps/Washington and the other regional offices across the country.</p>\n<p>Since the attack, our office has had an almost 15% increase in applications over the past year.</p>\n<p>This anniversary makes me realize how lucky I was, how grateful I am that no one from the Peace Corps was injured. My thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones, as well as with all of those people who made tremendous sacrifices.</p>\n<p>The silver lining in this experience is the cooperation and support we got from so many people around the world — it mirrored that sense of community I felt in the city around 9/11. But the most valuable thing of all is the unity of purpose that we all share at this great organization — it has never felt so important. Thank you.</p>\n•\n<p>Prior to serving as Regional Manager, Ed Jorge spent 25 years with Spanish-language media in New York City, working in marketing and sales for two of the leading Spanish daily newspapers and for a Colombian television and radio company.

Join the author on two unique cruises in “the Med,” visit its ports and islands, and engage with other “courageous” travelers.

        "link": "https://peacecorpsworldwide.org/executive-director-of-hpp-martha-ryan-ethiopia/",
        "description": "<p> </p>\n<p>“I wanted to make the world better. That’s what we’re supposed to do, right?” Ask Martha Ryan (Ethiopia 1973-75), who says Peace Corps Ethiopia put her on her path.</p>\n<p> </p>\nFace-to-face with dire need\n<p>Martha taught school in Adi Arkai, Ethiopia (1973-75)</p>\n<p>Martha returned home to the Bay Area after her tour as a PCV in Ethiopia. She earned a nursing degree, and took a job at San Francisco General Hospital, and worked in intensive care. But then she found herself pulled back to Africa, where she’s cared for refugees fleeing civil war in camps in Sudan and Somalia, and travelled with a team of nurses to Uganda.</p>\n<p>But short-term trips weren’t enough. After a few weeks or months back in the U.S., Martha longed to return to Africa to live. It was where, she believed, she could most be of service — a value that was ingrained in her while at the University of San Francisc0 (USF).</p>\n<p>“USF always taught about social justice, about service. That really made an impression on me and probably influenced me more than anything else,” Ryan says.</p>\n<p>Then, unexpectedly, she found a community in crisis right in her own backyard.</p>\n<p>While volunteering at a homeless shelter in San Francisco in 1988, Ryan came face-to-face with a dire, unmet need.</p>\n<p>“There were homeless, expectant moms, women battling addiction and abuse, and they weren’t getting any prenatal care,” Martha says. “Things got worse and worse. There were homeless mothers with young kids too. It was crazy. I’d go around and tell public health officials. They’d say, ‘That’s terrible.’ But no one did anything.”</p>\nTurn your life around\n<p>Ryan had a vision — a program that would empower these women.</p>\n<p>“Pregnancy is a wonderful window of opportunity for a mother to turn her life around. I wanted to invest in these women and their ability to change their lives,” she says.</p>\n<p>And so Ryan took a grant-writing class and, to her surprise, won $52,000 in seed money. She used it to start the Homeless Prenatal Program (HPP) with three part-time staff and no office. They served 72 women the first year.</p>\n<p>More than 25 years later, the nonprofit family resource center has grown beyond what Ryan ever imagined. Its 80 staff members serve 4,000 San Franciscans annually. Over 3,500 babies have been born with HPP’s support, 90 percent at healthy, normal weight.</p>\nBreak the cycle of poverty\n<p>But for Ryan, who received an honorary degree from USF in 2013, those numbers only tell half of the story. HPP has grown into a comprehensive family resource agency, offering housing assistance, parenting support, financial and technology literacy, and community health worker training — all aimed at empowering expectant and new mothers to break the cycle of poverty.</p>\n<p>At that, too, Ryan and HPP have succeeded. More than half of her staff are former clients, shaping the programs in which they once participated. Former clients have also gone on to become homeowners and earn college degrees.</p>\n<p>“Once people have opportunities and believe in themselves, they’re incredibly resilient. Nothing stops them,” Ryan says.</p>\n<p></p>\n\nA special message from Martha Ryan, Founder &amp; Executive Director\n<p>January 27, 2022</p>\n<p>Dear Friend,</p>\n<p>With gratitude for your support of the Homeless Prenatal Program (HPP), I am writing with some news that I wanted you to hear from me. After serving as the Executive Director of HPP for the past 32 years, I am beginning to plan my retirement. This summer, I plan on stepping aside from my day-to-day leadership role to assume a new role as Founder which will focus on a new special project.</p>\n\n<p>I am excited for the opportunity that this change brings for HPP, and I am confident that a new Executive Director will bring a fresh vision to carry the agency into its next 30 years. I am also proud to make this change knowing how set the agency is for ongoing success: the Executive Team, management and staff are not only dedicated and compassionate, but they are smart, resourceful and truly inspiring.</p>\n<p>HPP’s Board of Directors has known about my intentions for some time, and has been hard at work prepping and planning the transition process. They will be working with a search firm to hire the agency’s next leader. I have great gratitude for the Board’s leadership and absolute confidence in their process.</p>\n<p>As for my special project: we bought the building next door to HPP! We did so with the hope of expanding the agency’s services and creating affordable, permanent housing for families. My new role will be focused entirely on seeing this project from permits to blueprints to family move-in. Stay tuned!</p>\n<p>Over the years, HPP has earned a reputation in the community due much in part to its staff, its families, its volunteers and its supporters. We all have helped to shape HPP into what it is today — and what it will be tomorrow. Thank you, now as always, for being a part of our work.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Martha Ryan\nFounder &amp; Executive Director</p>",

        "description": "<p> </p>\n<p>A Five Finger Feast: Two Years in Kazakhstan, Lessons from the Peace Corps\nby Tim  Suchsland (Kazakhstan 2007–09), author and illustrator\nPeace Corps Writers, May 2022\n395 pages\n$19.99 (paperback)</p>\n<p>Reviewed by Philip Montgomery (Kazakhstan 2007–09)</p>\n<p>•</p>\n<p>Travel is one of the greatest educators in life. Even more educational — worldview shaping even — is living in a country that is not your own, understanding what it means to be the outsider, the guest, the stranger. In this sense, all travel is not equal. Some journeys break up the monotony of everyday life, while others leave immense, immeasurable impacts on the sojourner, the kinds of experience that shape us more completely.</p>\n<p>Tim Suchsland’s A Five Finger Feast is an account of one such journey. In this memoir, Suchsland takes the reader along with him through his 2-year adventure of travel, growth, and discovery. Rather than presenting a superficial touristy version of Kazakhstan and its history, Suchsland presents a nuanced understanding of the country’s unique history and culture.</p>\n<p>The style of the author’s hand-drawn illustrations that accompany his exploration of the villages, trains, cities, and schools of Kazakhstan reflects how memories can be at once vivid and stripped down. In the same way that narrative and visuals are blended to create a richer picture of a Peace Corps experience in Kazakhstan, Suchsland’s personal experiences as a foreigner — from the awkward privilege bestowed upon him as a beauty pageant judge to the challenge of remote border crossings into neighboring Kyrgyzstan — are interwoven with historical accounts that help contextualize one person’s experience within a wider narrative of regional history and politics.</p>\n<p>As it becomes rarer to find truly unique places in our globalizing world, A Five Finger Feast is on the one hand a nostalgic account of life in Kazakhstan in the late 2000s, and on the other a timeless tale of exploration, travel, and self discovery.</p>\n•\n<p>Phil &amp; Tim</p>\n<p>Reviewer Philip Montgomery is an RPCV who taught English in Kazakhstan with Tim. Since that experience over a decade ago, he has taught middle school Spanish in Arizona, high school English and research writing in Kazakhstan, and high school Spanish in Tennessee. He lives with his wife, daughter, and dog in Lansing, Michigan, where he is the Assistant Director of the Writing Center at Michigan State University.</p>",

        "title": "When Christ Stopped At Eboli",
        "link": "https://peacecorpsworldwide.org/when-christ-stopped-at-eboli/",
        "description": "by John Coyne (Ethiopia 1962-64)\n(First published in Dec 13 2009)\n<p> </p>\n<p>The other weekend when visiting a small used bookstore appropriately named the BookBarn in rural Columbia County in upstate New York, several miles from where we have a weekend home, I spotted on a shelf in this low ceiling cluttered store a copy of Carlo Levi’s Christ Stopped At Eboli. It is a book that I haven’t seen in some forty plus years, in fact since I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ethiopia.</p>\n<p>This book was one of appropriately 75 paperbacks that Sarge Shriver and the first administration of the Peace Corps put together in a portable ‘booklocker’ for Volunteers. The books were to be read and left in country, to become seeds for new libraries in the developing world where we were serving.</p>\n<p>The used copy I found in the Bookbarn was a later edition, a TIME Reading Program Special Edition, first published in 1964 with a new Editors’ Preface. The body of the book remains the same, however, and what a body of prose it is.</p>\n<p>First some background on Carlo Levi and the book for those of you who missed reading it while you were in college or in the Peace Corps.</p>\n<p>Carlo Levi was an Italian doctor and painter who had written polemics against Italy’s Fascist regime and was exiled in 1935 to Gagliano — a backward, malaria-ridden southern Italian village — after having been in prison for several years for opposing the Mussolini dictatorship. Levi would spend a year in this village before returning to northern Italy in 1936, after with he was freed in a political amnesty.</p>\n<p>The title comes from an expression by the people of Gagliano who would say, “Christ stopped short of here, at Eboli” which means, in effect, that they have been bypassed by Christianity, by morality, by history itself, that they have somehow been excluded from the human experience.</p>\n<p>Levi wrote Christ Stopped at Eboli eight years after the events he described in his book . . . 1943–1944. He was then living in Florence as a hunted member of the Underground. Some month later, in 1944–1945, he served as editor of a Resistance newspaper, La Nazione del Popolo. Early in 1945 he went to Rome and edited another Resistance newspaper. Christ Stopped at Eboli was published that year.</p>\n<p>I [and many other PCVs] read it in 1962–1963.</p>\n<p>In many ways, this memoir of Gagliano is the first Peace Corps book. Here is this educated man thrust into a backwater, malaria-ridden southern Italian village. As a doctor, he could help, but he would also learn. What RPCV wouldn’t say the same.</p>\n<p>When the word came that prisoners were to be released and he could leave Gagliano, he could not leave. “Everyone else left the next morning,” he wrote, “but I could not bring myself to hurry. I was sorry to leave and I found a dozen pretexts for lingering on.”  How many PCVs have felt the same way when reaching the end of their tours?</p>\n<p>The peasants, he writes, came to him. “Don’t go away. Stay here. Marry Concetta. They’ll make you the mayor. You must stay with us.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll come back.” Carlo told them.</p>\n<p>They shook their heads.</p>\n<p>“They wanted me to make a solemn promise to return and I made it in all sincerity, but I have not yet been able to keep it.”</p>\n<p>I am not sure if Carlo Levi ever returned to the village. I am not sure it is such a bad thing not to go home again. “The past is another country” as Thomas Hardy wrote years ago, and which is still true. Tom Wolfe knew he couldn’t go home again, even to Ashville, North Carolina.</p>\n<p>Most memories should be left unchanged. Carlo Levi was smart enough to leave those memories unchanged and then to capture them forever in this memoir, true and touching, and unblemished by time.</p>\n<p>Should he have married Concetta and stayed in Gagliano, this backward, malaria-ridden southern Italian village? Who is to say. Perhaps if he had, he would have written another book, but not this one.</p>\n<p>That’s the choice Carlo Levi had to make, and he did, going from southern Italian onto Florence and the war and his work with the Resistance. But he didn’t forget Gagliano. He made his little godforsaken village important by writing a masterpiece with the village and its citizens as its heroes and heroines. What more can a writer hope to do?</p>",

        "description": "Peace Corps Ethiopia &amp; Eritrea Through The Years\nMarian Haley Beil\nDebre Berhan 1962-1964\n<p>The Ethiopia &amp; Eritrea Returned Peace Corps Volunteer Board are pleased to announce our September Virtual Event featuring Marian Haley Beil, who was among the first volunteers in Ethiopia.</p>\nSave the date: Wednesday, September 14, 2022 8:00 PM ET / 5:00 PM PT\n<p>Marian Haley Beil was born and raised in Western Pennsylvania, where she received a BA in math from a small Catholic girls college. She went to the University of Maryland for one year to study math, and it was there, in early 1962, that she had the great idea…  to volunteer for the Peace Corps. By midsummer, she was in a training program with 324 others at Georgetown University to be a math teacher in Ethiopia.</p>\n<p>Since returning to the USA, she has worked tirelessly for the returned volunteers of Ethiopia and Eritrea. She started the first newsletter for the growing group of returning volunteers. Along with John Coyne, she started a blog: https://peacecorpsworldwide.org/category/pc-writers/ and worked to get the stories of the PCVs coming out of Ethiopia published. Finally, she established the Peace Corps Writers Imprint, encouraging all of us to write those stories down: https://peacecorpsworldwide.org/books/books-published-by-pc-writers/publish-with-pc-writers-imprint/</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There are few who can match her enthusiasm for her work with RPCV writers. There are many who owe her for her dedication for creating opportunities such as EERPCV in order to bring so many of us together.  This is an opportunity to learn more about our history from one who helped create it. Please join us for this occasion.</p>\n<p>We will send out the Zoom link the day before the event.</p>",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/giants-make-five-roster-moves.html",
        "description": "<p>The Giants have made a series of roster moves prior to tonight’s game against the Braves.  The contracts of outfielder Willie Calhoun and right-hander Cole Waites were selected from Triple-A, and roster space was created by the placement of Tommy La Stella on the 10-day injured list, outfielder Austin Dean being optioned to Triple-A, and catcher Patrick Mazeika being designated for assignment.</p>\n<p>La Stella is dealing with neck spasms, and given the calendar, it is possible La Stella might be shut down for the remainder of the 2022 season if he isn’t making progress by the time his 10-day minimum is up.  The IL has become an unfortunately familiar landing spot for La Stella over his two years in San Francisco, as he played in only 76 games in 2021 and 60 games this season due to a long list of health issues.  The infielder didn’t make his 2022 debut until mid-May due to recovery from offseason Achilles surgery.</p>\n<p>All of these injuries have limited La Stella’s production, as he has hit only .239/.282/.350 over 195 plate appearances this year.  He has also mostly been limited to DH duty, which is a hit for a player valued for his ability to play third, second, and first base.  If this is indeed it for La Stella in 2022, the Giants can only hope that a full winter of rest can get him back to his usual defensive role(s) in what will be the final year of his contract.  La Stella signed a three-year, $18.75MM free agent deal in February 2021 that to date hasn’t panned out for the Giants.</p>\n<p>Calhoun was acquired in a trade with the Rangers in June, and the slugger will now make his first Major League appearance outside of a Texas uniform.  A 21-homer season in 2019 seemingly served as a breakout for Calhoun, but several injuries and a lack of big league playing time stalled his career.  Calhoun was vocal about his desire for a trade after the Rangers optioned him to Triple-A earlier this season, as he’ll now get a fresh start with a late-season audition with the Giants.</p>\n<p>Thus far, the change of organization seems to have helped, as Calhoun has hit .299/.386/.465 with five homers in 166 PA with Triple-A Sacramento.  Carrying that production from the hitter-friendly Pacific Coast League to the majors will be a challenge, though if Calhoun can show some of his old form down the stretch, he could put himself into San Francisco’s plans for 2023.  Calhoun still has two years of arbitration control remaining, and he doesn’t turn 28 until November.</p>\n<p>Waites was an 18th-round selection for the Giants in the 2019 draft, and the righty is getting his first call to the majors.  Due to both knee surgery and the canceled 2020 minor league season, Waites doesn’t have a lot of pro experience, with only 71 1/3 total innings in the minors (40 2/3 of them this year).  However, he has a stunning 45.12% strikeout rate and 2.78 ERA over those 71 1/3 frames, though his 13.8% walk rate indicates shaky command.</p>\n<p>Baseball America (21st) and MLB Pipeline (29th) each rank Waites among the top 30 prospects in the Giants’ farm system, citing his plus fastball that can touch 100mph, as well as a slider that can be a dominant pitch when Waites can control it.  Waites has pitched exclusively as a reliever over the last two seasons, and projects as an intriguing bullpen arm if he can limit the free passes.</p>\n<p>Mazeika was claimed off waivers from the Mets on August 21, and he’ll now return to DFA limbo after eight games with the Giants’ Triple-A affiliate and no appearances at the big league level.  A long-time member of the Mets farm system, Mazeika has played in 61 MLB games over the 2021-22 seasons and hit .190/.236/.279 over 159 PA.  With Joey Bart now back from the concussion-related IL, San Francisco has made some adjustments to its catching depth in recent days, including Mazeika’s DFA and Andrew Knapp’s outright assignment to Triple-A.</p>",

        "description": "<p>8:28pm: Crane doesn’t sound as if he’s leaning towards a leadership change, telling Mark Berman of Fox 26 he’s “aware both contracts are up and we’ll address them at the end of the season. We don’t want any distractions right now” (Twitter link).</p>\n<p>6:50pm: The exact terms of James Click’s deal with the Astros weren’t publicized when he was hired in February 2020, but Chandler Rome of the Houston Chronicle reports that Click’s contract only runs through the conclusion of the 2022 season.  It isn’t known if any extension talks have yet taken place or will place, but Rome writes that “within the organization, speculation about [Click’s] future has been a growing topic since the end of spring.”</p>\n<p>After spending 14 years in the Rays front office, Click took over the Houston job in rather abrupt circumstances, hired less than a month after former GM Jeff Luhnow was fired in the wake of the sign-stealing scandal.  That organizational shake-up also cost A.J. Hinch his job as manager, leading to Dusty Baker’s hiring shortly before Click was brought on as the new head of baseball operations.</p>\n<p>Given all of the tumult and controversy surrounding the Astros in the last few years, there hasn’t been much carryover to the on-field product.  Houston finished 29-31 in the shortened 2020 season but still reached the playoffs, and advanced all the way to the ALCS.  In 2021, Houston won 95 games, recaptured the AL West title, and advanced to the World Series before falling to the Braves in six games.</p>\n<p>With a 90-50 record thus far this season, the Astros have the best record in the American League, and are again top contenders to win another championship.  In a recent podcast appearance, The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal implied that some postseason success could be a necessity for Click, as “there could be some [front office] maneuvering if the Astros sputter in the playoffs.”</p>\n<p>Even if Houston did get upset in their first postseason round, it would still seem like Click has earned a bit more leeway given the team’s record over his two-plus seasons.  However, as Rome notes, the Astros also took something of a wait-and-see approach with Baker — the manager initially signed a one-year deal with a club option that was only exercised after the 2020 season was complete, and Baker’s next contract was another one-year deal that is also up after the 2022 campaign.</p>\n<p>It could be that Astros owner Jim Crane is again waiting until the season is completely over to work out extensions with Baker and Click, with the focus being solely on baseball for the present.  Of course, that strategy also carries risk, as any teams with front office or managerial vacancies could then emerge as other suitors for Click or Baker’s services.</p>\n<p>If Crane was indeed considering a change, it would immediately make Houston one of the most sought-after employment destinations in baseball for any general manager.  The Astros are set up to be contenders for some time to come thanks to their fantastic core of both established and young talent — and that could also factor into Crane’s logic in perhaps wanting to move on.  Much of the Astros’ roster was already in the organization before Click was hired, so it is possible Crane could see him as something of a steward of Luhnow’s work.  Given the rather rushed circumstances behind Click and Baker’s hirings, Crane might prefer to take more time in a longer search to find the leader (or leaders) of the next chapter of the Astros’ future.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Ryne Nelson makes start #2, and we look at Zac Gallen’s Cy Young chances</p> \n\nToday's Lineups\n\n\n\n\nDODGERS\nDIAMONDBACKS\n\n\n\n\nMookie Betts - 2B\nCarson Kelly - C\n\n\nTrea Turner - SS\nKetel Marte - 2B\n\n\nFreddie Freeman - 1B\nJake McCarthy - RF\n\n\nWill Smith - C\nChristian Walker - 1B\n\n\nMax Muncy - 3B\nEmmanuel Rivera - 3B\n\n\nJustin Turner - DH\nStone Garrett - DH\n\n\nJoey Gallo - LF\nJordan Luplow - LF\n\n\nTrayce Thompson - RF\nAlek Thomas - CF\n\n\nCody Bellinger - CF\nGeraldo Perdomo - SS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyler Anderson - LHP\nRyne Nelson - RHP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoster moves\n<p>The Arizona Diamondbacks made the following roster moves:</p>\n\nRecalled OF Jordan Luplow from Triple-A Reno.\nDesignated INF Wilmer Difo for assignment.\n\n<p>Ryne Nelson’s MLB debut was better than anything he, we and everyone connected with the Diamondbacks could have hoped for. Seven shutout innings? That’ll do. Throw in the no walks and seven strikeouts and you are into almost unprecedented territory. The only previous pitcher to accomplish all that in their first game was Nick Kingham of the 2018 Pirates. But let’s hope Nelson’s career doesn’t follow a similar path. Though Kingham got the W in his second start, he was tagged for four runs in 5.1 innings. He threw only 131.2 innings in the majors, with a 6.08 ERA, and after his sophomore season of 2019, Nick has spent the last three years pitching in Korea. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Zac Gallen’s 44.1 inning scoreless streak has forced himself into the discussion for the National League Cy Young. Going into the break, Sandy Alcantara of the Miami Marlins seemed like a lock with his 1.74 ERA, ahead of Corbin Burnes’s 2.14 - Gallen’s 3.56 ERA languished down in 16th place among NL qualifiers. But since the All-Star game, both Alcantara and Burnes have ERA’s north of four, while Gallen has been below one - 0.97 to be precise. As a result, his 2.50 season figure now sits third, trailing just Julio Urias (2.30) and Alcantara (2.43). Urias has the edge in wins, with sixteen compared to twelve for the other two. But he and Alcantara also have seven losses; Gallen has only a pair of L’s. </p>\n<p>Alcantara does have the edge in sheer workload, averaging better than seven innings a start, something almost unheard of these days. He has four complete games - more than any other TEAM in the majors this year. It’s one of the reasons his bWAR of 6.8 is 1.3 wins more than everyone else. Gallen sits sixth by that metric, with 4.7 bWAR. He occupies the same spot in fWAR, sitting at 3.9 fWAR: the leaders there are Carlos Rodon and Aaron Nola at 5.4. If we combine the two and take the average, here are the figures for those who are ranked highly by both metrics [Interestingly, Urias is outside the top ten by both, rating 4.0 bWAR and 2.8 fWAR, for a 3.4 average] </p>\n\n<p>It all seems very much to play for, with four weeks left in the season. If Gallen can keep up the stellar form he showed during August, he should certainly be in the Cy Young conversation. It has been a long time since we’ve been able to say that about any Arizona pitcher. </p>",

        "description": "Wm. Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin / USA TODAY NETWORK\n    \n\n  <p>Chourio earns promotion to AA Biloxi as High-A and Low-A close out seasons</p> <p>Each week, I’ll be bringing you a roundup of the Brewers minor league affiliates, including score updates, key players and more. Here is the week 23 roundup.</p>\n<p>AAA Nashville</p>\n<p>The Sounds scuffled to a 2-4 week against the Charlotte Knights (54-81), falling to 81-53 on the season. With the tough week, the Columbus Clippers closed the division lead to 2.5 games as they’re now 78-55 on the season.</p>\n<p>After being demoted from the Brewers, Esteury Ruiz went 3-for-7 with two homers and five RBIs across two games with Nashville. Fellow outfielder Matt Lipka slashed .500/.533/.929 with two homers and four RBIs himself. As a team, the Sounds slashed a solid .288/.362/.507 with 10 homers and 38 runs scored.</p>\n<p>Josh Lindblom, Robert Gasser and Caleb Boushley all had strong starts this week for Nashville. Lindblom through six shutout innings, allowing two hits and one walk to go with eight strikeouts. Gasser went 6 ⅔ innings, allowing one run on five hits and one walk with eight strikeouts. Boushley went six innings, allowing one run on three hits and one walk with a single strikeout. While the trio of starters were strong, the rest of the pitching staff wasn’t. Nashville finished with a 6.08 ERA across 50 ⅓ innings with 43 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>The Sounds now take on the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp (73-61) at home. Nashville is 8-4 against Jacksonville this season.</p>\n<p>AA Biloxi</p>\n<p>The Shuckers had a strong 4-2 week against the Mississippi Braves, but they were officially eliminated from the playoffs at 28-34 in the second half.</p>\n<p>Outfielder Terence Dotson slashed .471/.471/.824 with two homers and five RBIs on the week, while first baseman Wes Clarke slashed .318/.360/.909 with four homers and seven RBIs. As a team, the Shuckers slashed .304/.368/.485 with nine homers and 31 runs scored.</p>\n<p>Starters Justin Jarvis and Victor Castaneda had a pair of strong starts. Jarvis went seven innings, giving up one run on three hits and two walks while striking out six. Castaneda went five innings, striking out three while allowing one run on three hits and five walks. As a staff, the Shuckers finished with a 6.05 ERA across 55 innings with 56 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Biloxi now travels to Pensacola to take on the first-half champion Blue Wahoos (32-29 in the second half). Biloxi is surprisingly 13-11 against Pensacola this season.</p>\n<p>High-A Wisconsin</p>\n<p>The Timber Rattlers went 4-0 against the Beloit Sky Carp (31-33) to finish the second half of the season at 33-31 and in second place in the Midwest League West standings.</p>\n<p>Catcher Jeferson Quero stayed hot to end the year, slashing .412/.412/.765 with two homers and five RBIs. Shortstop Eduardo Garcia slashed .462/.462/.923 with two homers and six RBIs himself. Despite a poor week by his standards (.250/.294/.313), Jackson Chourio was promoted to AA Biloxi on Monday at the conclusion of the High-A season. At 18 years old, he’ll be the youngest player at the AA level. As a team, the Rattlers slashed .313/.383/.534 with six homers and 28 runs scored.</p>\n<p>Zach Mort threw five scoreless innings of relief, allowing just three hits and no walks while striking out five. Alexander Cornielle went six innings in his start, allowing one run on four hits and two walks with seven strikeouts. The Rattlers pitching staff finished with a 2.00 ERA over 36 innings with 39 strikeouts in the four-game sweep.</p>\n<p>A Carolina</p>\n<p>The Mudcats closed the season going 2-3 against the Myrtle Beach Pelicans (31-34) to finish at 35-30 in the second half, good enough for second place in the Carolina League North standings.</p>\n<p>Second baseman and 2022 draftee Robert Moore closed out his season slashing .286/.375/.619 with two homers and six RBIs across the final five games. Catcher Jesus Chirinos slashed .250/.368/.500 with a homer and five RBIs, while 2022 first-round pick Eric Brown Jr. slashed .350/.458/.500 with a team-leading seven hits. As a team, the Mudcats slashed .243/.338/.350 with three homers and 25 runs scored.</p>\n<p>Fernando Olguin and Cameron Wagoner both had strong relief appearances for Carolina this week. Olguin went three scoreless, allowing one hit and two walks with four strikeouts. Wagoner went 4 ⅔ innings allowing one run on four hits and no walks with six strikeouts. As a team, the Mudcats pitched to a 5.15 ERA over 43 ⅔ innings with 37 strikeouts to close out the season.</p>\n<p>Performances by Top 10 Brewers Prospects (Weekly Performance; Season Totals)</p>\n\n(MLB No. 11) OF Jackson Chourio (AA)*: .250/.294/.313 (16 at-bats), 0 HR, 2 RBI; .300/.354/.562 (377 at-bats), 20 HR, 71 RBI\n(MLB No. 49) OF Sal Frelick (AAA): .259/.333/.296 (27 at-bats), 0 HR, 2 RBI; .323/.400/.453 (439 at-bats), 7 HR, 46 RBI\n(MLB No. 89) OF Joey Wiemer (AAA): .333/.462/.667 (21 at-bats), 1 HR, 4 RBI; .251/.331/.465 (454 at-bats), 21 HR, 73 RBI\nSS Brice Turang (AAA): .182/.357/.182 (11 at-bats), 0 HR, 2 RBI; .290/.364/.412 (483 at-bats), 12 HR, 70 RBI\nOF Garrett Mitchell (MLB): .200/.333/.300 (10 at-bats), 0 HR, 1 RBI; .271/.363/.411 (280 at-bats), 6 HR, 40 RBI\n2B Tyler Black (High-A): On 7-day injured list (7/18); .281/.406/.424 (231 at-bats), 4 HR, 35 RBI\nC Jeferson Quero (High-A): .412/.412/.765 (17 at-bats), 2 HR, 5 RBI; .286/.342/.439 (367 at-bats), 10 HR, 57 RBI\nOF Esteury Ruiz (AAA)^: .429/.556/1.286 (7 at-bats), 2 HR, 5 RBI; .320/.434/.513 (419 at-bats), 15 HR, 58 RBI\nRHP Jacob Misiorowski (A): 1 ⅓ IP, 1 H, 0 R (0 ER), 3 BB, 3 SO (0.00 ERA); 1 ⅔ IP, 1 H, 1 R (1 ER), 7 BB, 3 SO (5.40 ERA)\nSS Eric Brown Jr. (A): .350/.458/.400 (20 at-bats), 0 HR, 0 RBI; .268/.385/.454 (97 at-bats), 3 HR, 8 RBI\n\n<p>*Jackson Chourio was promoted to AA Biloxi on 9/12; his weekly stats are from High-A Wisconsin</p>\n<p>^Esteury Ruiz was optioned to AAA Nashville on 9/8; his weekly stats are from AAA</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Monday said in a court filing it would support one of the special master nominees put forward by former President Trump’s legal team to review documents seized during an FBI search of Mar-a-Lago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Justice Department asked the court to consider appointing its two choices for special master as well as Raymond Dearie, a retired U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of New York who was nominated by former President Reagan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In its filing, the DOJ cited “previous federal judicial experience and engagement in relevant areas of law” as being “important qualifications for this position.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump team’s other nominee, Paul Huck Jr., spent his legal career working in both the public sector and the private sector, including serving as deputy attorney general in Florida and as a general counsel to then-Gov. Charlie Crist, who at the time was serving as a Republican.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DOJ is also asking the court to consider appointing its two nominees, Barbara Jones, a former U.S. district judge for the Southern District of New York appointed by former President Clinton, and Thomas Griffith, a former federal judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia who currently works at a law firm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Justice Department said in its filing it opposed Huck’s nomination because he did not have relevant experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Judges Jones, Griffith and Dearie each have substantial judicial experience, during which they have presided over federal criminal and civil cases, including federal cases involving national security and privilege concerns. The government respectfully opposes the appointment of Paul Huck Jr., who does not appear to have similar experience,” the department wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A federal judge in Florida on Labor Day granted Trump’s request to appoint a special master to review documents seized at Mar-a-Lago last month, dismissing objections by the DOJ and blocking further review and use of the documents in its investigation of potential mishandling of classified information after Trump left the White House.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A partially redacted search warrant revealed that federal law enforcement suspected Trump violated the Espionage Act and other laws when it sought to search his Florida property, where authorities obtained 11 different sets of classified documents, including some marked top secret. </p>",

        "description": "<p>President Biden on Monday acknowledged \"a really difficult two years\" if Democrats lose control of Congress in November's midterm elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden said at a Democratic National Committee fundraising event in Boston that he would spend a lot more time \"in the veto\" because he would have difficulty getting \"anything done\" legislatively if Republicans take over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We need to control the House and the Senate to win the race up and down the ticket,“ Biden said, according to a pool report. \"If we lose the House or lose the Senate, it's going to be a really difficult two years. I'll be spending more time in the veto, being able to get anything done.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden, however, also said that he was \"optimistic\" about the country and noted that he believes young people aged 18 to 30 are \"the single most engaged generation.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I genuinely am more optimistic about the prospects for America, not because I'm president, because of the nature of where we are as a country,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He noted the midterm elections being less than two months away, again marking the urgency of issues that are on the line such as the right to privacy, school safety for kids and the climate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It's about democracy itself,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also warned that if Democrats lose the election, they will also lose a chance to codify Roe v Wade, which the Supreme Court overturned in June. Biden reiterated his support for codifying the right to an abortion and said if Republicans take over, they likely will seek ways to instead codify the Supreme Court decision making it illegal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And mark my words, you’re gonna see a move on other privacy issues from contraception to marriage, a whole range of things,” he said.</p>",

It’s unacceptable for me or anyone to use that language in such a hurtful way, there’s no excuse for it, at all,” the 21-year-old former University of Georgia standout wrote in a tweet. “I was raised better than that!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The NBA has fined players such as Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant and Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic for using anti-gay language in social media posts and during games, according to ESPN. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The NBA told The Hill in a statement that it was reviewing the Edwards incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Updated 9:58 p.m.</p>",

        "description": "Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Despite plenty of hard contact, the Kitties were thrown out trying to score twice, and lined the ball into Astros’ gloves all game long.</p> <p>The Tigers had some chances early, but the breaks went Houston’s way, and Framber Valdez settled in to spin a complete game shut out on six hits, with 107 pitches thrown. That was the 21st time the Tigers have been shut out in 2022.</p>\n<p>Houston didn’t take long to draw blood in this one. Jose Altuve led off with a single, stole second base, and scored on a Jeremy Pena ground ball before Eduardo Rodriguez had thrown five pitches. Pena immediately stole second as well, and after Rodriguez struck out Yordan Alvarez, Alex Bregman followed with a ground ball back up the middle to score Pena as well. Kyle Tucker and Yuli Gurriel both lined out to end the inning.</p>\n<p>Riley Greene led off with a walk in the bottom half. Willi Castro struck out, but Greene advanced to third on a wild pitch and then a throwing error from Martin Maldonado. Unfortunately, Greene would be cut down at home by Gurriel as he went home on contact trying to score on a Javy Báez ground ball. Eric Haase followed with a single to keep the scoring opportunity alive, but a hard hit fly ball to left center field off the bat of Spencer Torkelson unluckily went for the final out despite travelling 416 feet. Ah Comerica. At least the hard contact remains plentiful for the rookie first baseman.</p>\n<p>Both teams went in order in the second, but the Astros put together another scoring chance in the top of the third. With one out, Pena and Alvarez singled, and Bregman walked to load to the bases. Fortunately they’d only get one run as Tucker grounded into a double play, with Pena scoring in the process. </p>\n<p>The Tigers were caught trying to score again in the bottom half when Willi Castro doubled with two outs. Báez pulled a ground ball through the left side, but left fielder Alvarez cut down Castro at the plate to end the inning. Initially, Castro was ruled safe, but replay confirmed he was tagged a couple inches before hitting home plate.</p>\n<p>Frustrating.</p>\n<p>Also a little frustrating was Rodriguez’s difficulty collecting quick innings against the Astros. He got the first two in the fourth, but back-to-back singles from Chas McCormick and Martin Maldonado set up another scoring opportunity for Houston. E-Rod got Altuve to fly out to center field, but he was already at 70 pitches when the inning ended. Of course, had two plays at the plate gone otherwise, he would’ve had some run support to work with as well. Against the Astros, even letting them get up a run early feels like it turns the pressure up to 11.</p>\n<p>The Astros came back with more heat for Rodriguez in the fifth. Pena led off with a double to left, and Alvarez followed with a single the same direction to move Pena to third. Ryan Kreidler picked an Alex Bregman grounder and fired home to Haase to cut down Pena trying to score, so it was good to return the favor in that regard. However, Alvarez went first to third on the play and scored on a Tucker ground out to make it 4-0. Yuli Gurriel doubled in Bregman to left, and just like that Rodriguez had completely imploded again. 5-0 Astros.</p>\n<p>Rodriguez yanked a changeup down on the plate, and that went for a wild pitch rather than a passed ball. Gurriel advanced to third. Trey Mancini finally grounded out to Báez to finally end the inning. The Tigers quickly went 1-2-3 in the bottom half.</p>\n<p>That would end Eduardo Rodriguez’s day. 5.0 IP, 5 ER, 10 H, BB, 2 SO. Rodriguez didn’t even pitch that badly. He wasn’t helped by Haase’s inability to get called strikes around the edges, where E-Rod likes to work. Still, despite getting a decent number of whiffs, he just had little with which to put away Astros’ hitters, who do the two-strike approach really well. Again and again they stayed back, shortened up, and hit the ball on a line somewhere when deep in counts, while the Tigers beat Valdez’s sinker into the dirt and swung over the curve. Too much hard contact against Rodriguez, and he didn’t help the cause by failing to hold runners in the first inning. Haase doesn’t have a particularly good throwing arm, but he didn’t get much of a chance in either case. </p>\n<p>Jason Foley took over in the sixth. He got a quick ground out from McCormick, popped out Maldonado, and got an Altuve ground out for the second clean inning of the night from Tigers’ pitching. The Tigers got a Riley Greene single in the sixth and no more.</p>\n<p>Garrett Hill came on in relief in the top of the seventh, showing off some delivery changes and hitting 96 mph repeatedly. Hill is raising his hands over his head and he goes into the windup, and looked to be getting down the mound a little more aggressively. He popped up Pena, then pitcher around Alvarez a bit, walking him. Hill bounced back to jam Bregman and get a lazy fly ball, and then fell behind Kyle Tucker before dusting him with a pair of fastballs Tucker couldn’t find.</p>\n<p>Torkelson started the bottom half off with another rocket off of Valdez, but for the second time it was playable by an Astros outfielder, going right to Alvarez in left. Candelario popped out. Kreidler also smoked a hard line drive, and that also went right to McCormick in center field for an out. Contact was pretty good all game long for Torkelson who hit three balls hard and came away with nothing to show for it. Batted ball luck was not.</p>\n<p>Hill quickly set the Astros down 1-2-3 in the top of the eighth, looking quite good in the process.</p>\n<p>Valdez cruised into the bottom of the eighth giving up a one-out single to Victor Reyes, but striking out Riley Greene for his seventh punchout on the night. Willi Castro grounded out on Valdez’s 96th pitch, as the lefty just pounded the strike zone and racked up quick outs all game long.</p>\n<p>Will Vest struggled with his command in the top of the ninth, allowing two more runs, but this one was out of hand already. The only question was whether Valdez would come out in the ninth. </p>\n<p>Dusty Baker decided to ride with his lefty and give him the chance to close this one out, and he did so in much the same fashion the whole game had seen. He struck out Báez, and then Haase smoked a line drive right to Pena at shortstop, and Torkelson drilled a drive about 400 feet to center field, and Mauricio Dubon, in as a defensive replacement, had it all the way.</p>\n<p>Small comforts, but Eric Haase continued his solid hitting of late, collecting a pair of singles. Torkelson hit the ball 105.5 mph, 106.1 mph, 107.1 mph, and 105.4 mph, and had nothing to show for it despite drilling the baseball all game long.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Alva Finn is Secretary General of Social Platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This summer was meant to be our first normal one since 2019. But for too many, due to rising cost-of-living, a return to normal has become a pipe dream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the largest leading organization fighting for social justice, Social Platform’s civil society members represent Europe in all its diversity, and they’re reporting the bloc’s citizens are being hit hard, especially those who are in vulnerable situations and on low incomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Older people are struggling to pay energy bills, single mothers aren’t able to buy milk for their babies. Overall, this autumn and winter are shaping up to be breathtakingly dire for many.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with most problems, however, there are solutions if the political will is there to adopt them. This year’s State of the European Union (SOTEU), the bloc’s flagship event, will perhaps be the most crucial in its history, and with European elections just around the corner, the Commission may be more mindful of what people really want — a just and inclusive Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Far from just grandstanding, this is a speech that lays the foundation for the coming year’s work. But it has, all too often, focused on the out-of-date “jobs and growth” paradigm, without much time given to the bloc’s social state. In the face of multiple crises, including soaring cost-of-living, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, rising energy poverty and the consequences of climate change, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has an opportunity to make this year’s speech relevant by putting concrete social solutions on the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A recent Eurobarometer survey shows that at 38 percent, many want the fight against poverty and social exclusion to be the EU’s top priority. It also shows that 40 percent are reporting they have experienced a drop in their standard of living, and around 60 percent are saying they aren’t ready for rising energy and food prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Von der Leyen now has the chance to show that the soul of Europe really does lie in shared values, solidarity and social cohesion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, the EU is likely to take unprecedented decisions regarding wealth redistribution related to windfall profits of the energy sector and other measures including caps. This is a welcome shift in thinking away from harmful austerity, but to properly address systemic poverty and social exclusion in Europe, a minimum income directive is needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poverty in the EU is widespread, affecting one in five people. But the statistics also hide an important truth — people in vulnerable situations are much more likely to live in poverty. It affects 30 percent of those with disabilities, compared to 19 percent of those without, and 80 percent of the 12 million Roma living in the EU.</p>\n\n\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen now has the chance to show that the soul of Europe really does lie in shared values, solidarity and social cohesion | Pool photo by Johanna Geron/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n<p>A directive could stop people slipping into poverty and give them back buying power — even when they’re not working. This would be beneficial for both society and the economy, especially in times of crisis and as we face up to the potential opportunities and pitfalls of the green and digital transitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Von der Leyen will likely speak at length about the war in Ukraine as well, and we can no doubt expect strong proposals to increase pressure on President Vladimir Putin’s Russia and address Europe’s heavy reliance on Russian gas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as with the pandemic, we’re once again seeing why an empowered civil society and nonprofit sector are important actors during times of war and peace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ILGA-Europe and Transgender Europe are helping the LGBTI community flee Ukraine and gain access to medicines crucial to living their authentic lives; Caritas is helping run a family sponsorship program to help families find their feet; the International Federation of Social Workers is setting up community social work centers; EURORDIS-Rare Diseases Europe partnered with Airbnb to help those with rare diseases find suitable short-term housing; and Save The Children Romania is delivering vital, immediate support to mothers and children. The list goes on and on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tens of thousands of national, local and regional organizations are doing the lion’s share of the solidarity work, and often with little or no extra resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This SOTEU is an opportunity to pave the way for an EU Solidarity Strategy on Ukraine that moves beyond short-term planning, and brings together existing measures that keep communities and institutions across the bloc engaged, coordinated and supportive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This moment in Europe’s history is critical if we are to truly build a more resilient, socially just and inclusive Europe, and make substantial progress in ensuring a decent life for all people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU says it’s listening. I guess tomorrow we will find out.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Jamie Dettmer is opinion editor at POLITICO Europe.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Virgin Queen, Elizabeth I, died on March 24, 1603, ending the first Elizabethan age, a monumental era in England’s history. Her reign of 44 years and four months “a far greater part of a man’s age,” a contemporary noted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her lead coffin was conveyed along the Thames by night, on a torchlit barge from Richmond Palace to Whitehall, where she lay in state for a month. And with a funeral that saw her coffin carried from Whitehall to Westminster Abbey on a hearse drawn by horses, cloaked with black velvet and accompanied by six knights and a party of the most powerful peers of the realm, nothing was left to chance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the funeral, Tudor chronicler John Stow wrote: “Westminster was surcharged with multitudes of all sorts of people in their streets, houses, windows, leads and gutters, that came out to see the obsequy, and when they beheld her statue lying upon the coffin, there was such a general sighing, groaning and weeping as the like hath not been seen or known in the memory of man.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, nothing has been left to chance for Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral next week either. And the public mourning for the end of Britain’s second Elizabethan age aims to steady an unnerved nation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Britain’s longest-reigning monarch was intimately involved in the meticulous planning of the event that will likely transfix not only Britain but a good part of the world, with heads of state and government flying in from all over to attend — all except Russian President Vladimir Putin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as with any funeral, for commoner or royal, this one is meant to make people feel uplifted, confident and hopeful rather than despondent and fearful — an event aiming for the emotional balance of mournful and celebratory.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Elizabeth II leaves behind a nation that was severely disoriented and fractured even before her death, a nation more disunited than united, with the specter of a possible breakup of the Union hanging over it amid the economic setbacks dealt by the pandemic and the current energy squeeze. Brexit has added to the bafflement, despite the ebullient confidence of its ardent backers, and the death of the long-serving monarch has only furthered the anxiety and identity crisis.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Labour Party leader Keir Starmer observed last week, Elizabeth II seemed “the still point in a turning world.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first Elizabethan age had opened with hope and promise — a lot of which was fulfilled — but as it concluded, the country was similarly beset by challenges and confusion. In her last decade of life, the aging and increasingly depressed Queen Elizabeth I had to contend with mounting conflict in Ireland, famine and severe food shortages in England, as well as an uprising within her own court, ending with her signing the death warrant of her beloved Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sense of foreboding continued well into the reign of King James, with the Union of the two kingdoms forcing both the English and the Scots “to confront a hard set of questions about their identities,” as noted by literary historian James Shapiro.  </p>\n\n\n\nThe tomb of Queen Elizabeth I lies in Westminster Abbey in London, England | Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images\n\n\n\n<p>King James’ coronation was thus carefully planned with the aim of consolidating the Union of England, and despite his aversion to being in the public eye, the new king was alert to how monarchy is shaped and reinforced by public spectacle and performance. For his ceremonial entrance into London, which boasted only 40 Scottish residents before his arrival, he enlisted England’s great dramatists, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Thomas Middleton, et al.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a public spectacle that emphasized unity, with James concluding a lengthy address to parliament, saying: “What God hath conjoined, let no man separate. I am the husband, and all the whole isle is my lawful wife. I am the head, and it is my body. I am the shepherd, and it is my flock.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After his long apprenticeship, Britain’s King Charles III is equally aware of the power and symbolism of such pomp and circumstance, and how performance shapes public attitudes toward not only monarchy but the nation too.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of his mother’s funeral — and his own coronation — the new monarch is kicking off the Carolean age with an eye to boosting the unity of Britain’s four nations, with a tour and memorial events in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>National mourning isn’t just to be London-centric or English-focused, far from it. Queen Elizabeth’s funeral will symbolically play up all four nations’ importance to each other, and the British monarchy’s role in stitching together the tapestry of the United Kingdom over centuries, I am told by a member of the Royal Household.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will also highlight the significance of the Commonwealth, a voluntary association that grew under the queen’s watch from just a handful of countries to 54. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard not to conclude that the queen had always hoped, possibly even planned, to die in Scotland, at her beloved Balmoral — especially given the meticulous procession of her coffin, draped in the Royal Standard of Scotland and lamented by a bagpiper as it set off through rural Scotland to Edinburgh, and from there to London. It is a stately, solemn whistle-stop tour spanning the north to south of the British Isles’s main island, retracing the route of James I as he secured his throne. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though following convention and declining to take sides, Queen Elizabeth II had apparently purred down the phone in 2014, when then Prime Minister David Cameron informed her that the Scots had voted to remain part of the U.K. after a hard-fought independence referendum. No doubt she would have been cheered to see some Scots clutching their Union Jacks as her cortege followed the course of the River Dee toward Edinburgh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, throughout much of the queen’s reign, the U.K. has struggled to find a settled role. Back in 1962, former American Secretary of State Dean Acheson noted in a speech — and to the anger of the British press: “Great Britain has lost an empire and has not yet found a role.” He suggested the country was confused about its future identity, focused on its “special relationship” with the United States one moment, then looking toward Europe or the Commonwealth to give it greater meaning and influence the next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, as the U.K. grapples with the challenge of Scottish nationalism, the queen’s death doesn’t offer any answers to questions about Britain’s place in the world. Whether her passing, and how it is being marked, will assist in keeping Scotland inside the U.K., only time will tell.</p>",

        "description": "<p>L’AQUILA, Italy — At a rally in L’Aquila, a medieval university city surrounded by mountain peaks, Giorgia Meloni bellowed with fervor. “On September 25, it will be you who decides if this country is ready to be free.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The crowd cheered in response and waved tricolor flags as Meloni — flanked by local mayors — sang the national anthem from which her far-right party, Brothers of Italy, takes its name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polls suggest the Brothers will win the backing of one in four Italian voters in the election on September 25, putting Meloni on course to lead a right-wing coalition as Italy’s next prime minister. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the resignation of Mario Draghi in July, a Meloni victory would mark a sharp change of direction for Italy at a critical time for the country’s economy, as Europe grapples with the twin threats of war on its doorstep and rocketing inflation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meloni’s choice of L’Aquila, capital of the Abruzzo region, for the rally last week was not an accident. Historically swinging between center left and right, Abruzzo is now one part of the country where the Brothers’ policies can be seen in action. It was the first region to come under the party’s control in 2019, making it a laboratory for far-right rule. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the results seem popular enough. L’Aquila has been governed by a Brothers of Italy mayor since 2017 and he was reelected in June, winning 54 percent of the vote in the first round. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meloni told the crowd that she had chosen to run in this city as its candidate for parliament because she sees the region as “a symbolic territory” for her party. “This is the first land we governed and the symbol of our good governance … This is how we want to govern Italy.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to those gathered at the rally, the Brothers have demonstrated their competence in response to two major crises in the region: the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing reconstruction needs after an earthquake in 2009, which killed more than 300 and left 60,000 homeless. Locals also praised the authorities for securing a recent visit by the pope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Antonio Pace, a shepherd turned policeman, backed Meloni and criticized the way the left-wing authorities handled the aftermath of the earthquake. “If the right hadn’t got in, we would still be living in containers,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giacomo Soccorsi, a fireman, said he had come to see Meloni speak to decide whether to vote for her. “Since the right came in, the city is better every year. The building sites are working and the city has come alive again.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Locals seemed to like Meloni’s authenticity and working-class credentials, noting her “grit,” the fact she speaks plainly and shows determination. According to a recent poll by GDC Sondaggi, 25 percent of voters in Abruzzo plan to vote for Brothers of Italy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nationally, far-right populism has gained support after largely technocratic leadership since 2011 led to economic decline and undermined the legitimacy of traditional party politics, according to Pierluigi Testa of the Rome-based think tank Trinità dei Monti. That meant Meloni could benefit from her status as a political outsider. </p>\n\n\n\nBrothers of Italy supporters cheer at a rally led by Giorgia Meloni as part of the campaign for the upcoming election | Piero Cruciatti/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n<p>“For a decade, Meloni stayed out of government and never got her hands dirty in coalitions,” said Testa. “More recently, she has reinvented herself as conservative instead of Euroskeptic, by supporting NATO and collaborating with Draghi and this has helped her gain the support of more sophisticated voters.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stefano Gardelli, the owner of a beach club in Pescara, is a long-standing supporter of Meloni who believes the Brothers’ success in Abruzzo prepares her well for taking national control. “The right won the region because they ran L’Aquila well, and demonstrated that Brothers of Italy can govern,” he said. “Now Abruzzo can be a model for the country.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not everyone thinks Abruzzo is a good template for Italy. In reality, it ranked as the ninth-worst region for the number of COVID-19 deaths per head of population and fared worse than comparable central regions such as Marche and Umbria. Opponents complain that health care is increasingly in the hands of private enterprise while the rights of women and minorities have been undermined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At both the city and regional levels, the Brothers have adopted measures that make it harder for migrants to access social housing. This is a point of pride for the party. “Thanks to Brothers of Italy, in Abruzzo the fast track for foreigners for social housing has been eliminated,” Meloni wrote in 2019. “Italians first is not just a slogan.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activists also took legal action against the city of L’Aquila after it refused food vouchers to immigrants during the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n‘Criminal and shortsighted’ \n\n\n\n<p>Pierluigi Iannarelli, leader of the local center-left Democratic Party, denounced what he called “unacceptable discrimination” as “criminal and shortsighted, in a historic emergency.” He told POLITICO: “The treatment of immigrants has definitely gotten worse since they took power.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campaigners are also concerned that the local authorities’ policies weaken women’s reproductive rights. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The region’s health authority has ignored national government guidelines that allow women to obtain a pharmaceutical abortion without a hospital stay. Then last year, three regional Brothers of Italy politicians proposed a law to bury aborted fetuses in a cemetery, even without a request from the woman. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to activists, enforced hospital stays prevent some women from getting abortions as they may have to take time off work, or arrange child care, while the creation of cemeteries for aborted fetuses is intended to shame women who abort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sara Marcozzi, a regional councilor in the centrist Impegno Civico grouping, successfully opposed the proposals for such a cemetery. In Abruzzo, one doesn’t breathe fascism in the air, she said, but this proposal “smelled of fascism.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Left-wingers and representatives of minorities are concerned that the right will be further emboldened if they take power at the national level. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patrick Guobadia, an activist for immigrant rights in Abruzzo of Nigerian origin, said that Abruzzo is not a racist place, but “where the right govern in Italy, immigrant issues are second place. We know they don’t want immigrants in Italy.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Abruzzo may be the Brothers’ home territory, not everyone expects the right’s success in Abruzzo or at the national level to last for long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcozzi, the councilor, warned that it is “easy to win making promises and riding on a wave of people’s fear. But then you have to do things.” Referencing the flame in the Brothers of Italy logo, she said: “I think the flame will go out soon.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>Dr. Hans Kluge is the regional director of the World Health Organization/Europe. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amid the ongoing global monkeypox outbreak, some worry it may be too late to effectively control — let alone eliminate — the disease from areas where it’s not endemic, given the nature and extent of the global spread.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, likely due to a combination of reduction in risk behaviors and the availability of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, we’re currently observing numbers of new monkeypox cases plateauing, or gradually declining, in several countries in Europe, as well as certain areas in the United States. As a result, we are cautiously optimistic we can eventually end the public health emergency of monkeypox in Europe and the Americas, and end sustained human-to-human transmission.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such cautious optimism shouldn’t weaken our resolve to implement a concerted effort to address this emerging public health challenge, however. And to this end, we can draw on lessons from the past, notably our experience addressing HIV/AIDS.    </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Fauci’s career in particular has been shaped by major contributions in combating the disease in the U.S., and Dr. Kluge’s global public health experience includes a strong focus on HIV/AIDS, as well as tuberculosis in eastern Africa, Myanmar and areas of the former Soviet Union. And throughout the years, HIV/AIDS has taught us to never underestimate the ultimate impact of a new infectious disease for which there are many unanswered questions.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We shouldn’t forget that in the early years of AIDS, before we had diagnostic tests for HIV, the only patients brought to the attention of the health care system were those with disease advanced enough to be clinically apparent. With the advent of diagnostic tests, it soon became clear that these patients represented the very “tip of the iceberg,” and that most people with HIV were asymptomatic and in the early stages of their disease.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With monkeypox, we fortunately already have sensitive and specific diagnostics that allow us to widely screen at-risk individuals — an important tool for preventing asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic spread of virus. But there is still much to learn.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first days of AIDS, both in the U.S. and Europe, we’d initially thought the disease was strictly limited to a certain demographic group, namely men who have sex with men (MSM). However, we soon learned that although they were the most affected group in Western countries during the pandemic’s early stages, anyone was at risk depending on their individual behavior and circumstances.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, monkeypox isn’t a “gay disease,” although the current outbreak outside of Africa has so far primarily affected MSM. However, as with HIV/AIDS, other demographic groups, such as heterosexuals and injection drug users, also may be at risk. And with monkeypox, sex workers, homeless people, anyone with multiple sexual partners and, in some rare circumstances, children — in whom the risk is low — are also potentially at risk.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most unfortunate features of HIV/AIDS over four decades has been the stigma too often associated with it. Stigma is the enemy of effective public health efforts, and as we fight monkeypox, it is critical we avoid any stigmatization of at-risk populations.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, anecdotal evidence has already emerged in certain regions that discrimination against MSM is discouraging some from coming forward to get tested, vaccinated and treated, possibly leading to uninterrupted chains of transmission. Our interventions must be designed to recognize — and counter — stigma that might discourage those at risk from coming forward.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, we must emphasize the critical importance of conducting randomized controlled trials to rapidly generate robust scientific evidence for implementing vaccines and therapeutics. It has already been demonstrated in the context of other outbreaks — such as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 — that ethical and scientifically sound research can be conducted in the context of an ongoing infectious diseases outbreak. And we cannot allow the circumstances of an emerging outbreak to deter us from conducting rigorous studies, which will yield definitive answers to important public health questions on how to optimally manage it.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the successes in addressing HIV/AIDS in the U.S. and Europe was also our trust-building outreach to activists and community representatives, as well as their meaningful involvement in both our public health and research responses to the disease. This must be emulated with monkeypox.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meaningful involvement means community engagement in all areas of the response, including review of epidemiological data and research, as well as planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating our interventions. With the monkeypox outbreak, we have already seen positive results with behavioral modification due, at least in part, to public awareness campaigns. These efforts have featured accurate, timely messaging targeting MSM that has been adopted and disseminated by civil society organizations and organizers of mass events, such as Pride.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With HIV/AIDS, we initially were unaware of the etiologic agent, nor did we have reliable diagnostic tests or therapies or, even to this day, a vaccine — countermeasures that we already have with monkeypox. But once we had developed countermeasures, the challenge was their equitable global distribution and availability, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To this day, gaps persist in the distribution of anti-HIV drugs, leading to avoidable suffering and death. With monkeypox, let us ensure that countermeasures are accessible to all who need them, particularly the most vulnerable people with limited access to health care.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Countries in Africa where monkeypox has long been endemic cannot be an afterthought. Equity must mean global equity — stretching well beyond North America and Europe. And it is crucial to control and eliminate monkeypox in endemic as well as newly affected countries, while enhancing global access to diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.    </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WHO/Europe — which covers 53 countries across Europe and Central Asia — and the U.S. are working together closely to address the global monkeypox threat. Europe, where the initial cases emerged just a few months ago, was the region with the highest cumulative case load. But now, the U.S. has the largest number of cases. Our experiences in responding to HIV and other health crises in the past, including COVID-19, have been similar.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, a strong transatlantic partnership in emergency preparedness and response — and public health more broadly — between the U.S. and WHO/Europe can serve us well in responding to this public health emergency, and in preparing for the next emerging infectious disease.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us galvanize our current efforts and work together across regions and countries to mobilize resources, and use an integrated approach to control and, eventually, eliminate monkeypox. As recent public health emergencies of international concern have reminded us yet again, a public health crisis anywhere can quickly become a public health crisis everywhere — and we must be prepared.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Ukraine’s swift battlefield advances are forcing European governments to once again confront an uncomfortable question: Will they significantly boost weapons deliveries? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a touchy subject in many European capitals, where the energy crisis and cost-of-living woes have dominated public attention over the past weeks, prompting warnings of war fatigue. But Ukraine’s counteroffensive against Russia in recent days has changed the narrative — at least for the moment — giving a new opening to those wanting European governments to step up their arms deliveries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First among them is the Ukrainian government itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are turning the tide and need more heavy weapons and ammunition from our allies to build upon the momentum, save more people, and liberate more of Ukraine’s territories faster,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told POLITICO in a statement on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The more military support we receive now, the faster this war will end,” he added. “This is why Ukraine calls on its partners to focus on the schedule: prompt supplies of what the Ukrainian army needs will bring victory and peace closer.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a sentiment echoed among those who found their pleas for more immediate European military assistance increasingly falling on deaf ears as Kyiv’s partners turned attention to training Ukrainian soldiers and ramping up arms production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trend will, of course, not change overnight. The Ukrainian surge does not necessarily indicate a permanent shift in the war. And, logistically speaking, many European governments are low on expendable supplies. Other countries, including France and Germany, also seem reluctant to significantly boost donations, even if military experts say it’s possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet that hasn’t stopped advocates for more support from leaping at the chance to resurrect their pitch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Ukrainian armed forces have made a remarkably rapid advance over the weekend,” Dutch Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren said in an email. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“With our steadfast military support, they can make the difference on the battlefield,” she added. “It encourages me to step up the game even more.”  </p>\n\n\n\n‘A re-energizing ray of light’\n\n\n\n<p>Kuleba laid out Kyiv’s request as its forces pushed northeast through the Russian line over the weekend, taking back key supply hubs in the Donbas region. It was a series of victories, Kuleba argued, that show the impact of Western donations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Ukraine’s advances in the east and south prove that all the investments that our Western partners have made in our defense capabilities do yield astonishing results,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There should be no doubt now,” Kuleba added, “that Ukraine can win and Russia can be defeated on the battlefield.”</p>\n\n\n\nA shipment of weapons including Javelin anti-tank missiles and other military hardware sent by the United States military at Boryspil Airport near Kyiv on January 25, 2022 | Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\n\n\n<p>The Netherlands’ Ollongren argued there is a need to “accelerate cooperation and maximize concrete deliveries, ammunition, training and maintenance in particular.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United States is ultimately the most important provider of military assistance to Ukraine. It has continued to approve more weapons shipments, announcing last week a fresh $675 million in arms, as well as a broader $2.2 billion military financing package for Kyiv and 18 regional partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the Ukrainian military’s recent progress has raised hopes that Kyiv’s performance will boost efforts to convince European capitals to do more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am certain,” said one senior diplomat from an eastern NATO country, “that the recent Ukrainian successes will irreversibly consolidate the determination of those who support Ukraine.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There is a re-energizing ray of light,” the diplomat said, “that normally should translate into more solidarity and support for Ukraine.”</p>\n\n\n\nGermany and France stay the course\n\n\n\n<p>Early reactions in Berlin and Paris have been warier, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even as the Ukrainian counteroffensive was underway late last week, German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht ruled out an increase of weapons supplies to Kyiv. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our values, democracy, freedom and security are being defended in Ukraine,” she told POLITICO in an interview. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, Lambrecht stressed, Germany’s stocks are depleted — a result of years of underinvestment. Berlin must hold back weapons to ensure its own defense capabilities until it can rebuild its forces via a recent €100 billion investment fund. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I would very much like to be able to give significantly more to Ukraine,” Lambrecht said. “If the Bundeswehr had not been so cut up in the years before, that would have been possible. But this is now the consequence of this irresponsible saving.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lambrecht’s arguments haven’t stopped German Chancellor Olaf Scholz from facing renewed pressure to step up his military assistance to Ukraine. International allies, political opponents and even some within his own government are all leaning on him to act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Everyone in the government knows that even more would be possible,” Omid Nouripour, the German Greens’ co-leader, told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper. The Greens are part of a three-party coalition government with Scholz’s Social Democrats and the liberal Free Democratic Party. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nouripour specifically called on Scholz to send Germany’s own modern tanks to Ukraine — something it has avoided, opting instead to give NATO allies replacement tanks if they donate Soviet-era models to Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My expectations are even higher for Germany,” U.S. Ambassador to Germany Amy Gutmann told German public broadcaster ZDF on Sunday evening, without going into details. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scholz on Monday defended his government’s approach, arguing Berlin’s arms shipments have directly aided the counteroffensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The weapons that we have delivered,” he said at a press conference in Berlin, “are actually contributing to the fact that it is now possible in the eastern battle to change the outcome in the way that we are currently seeing.”</p>\n\n\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi on a visit to Ukraine in June 2022 | Ludovic Marin/POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n<p>The pressure felt in Germany has thus far spared French President Emmanuel Macron, though. Public debate has focused elsewhere despite international rankings showing France lagging behind the U.K., Germany, Poland, Estonia and Denmark on military support for Ukraine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a briefing with reporters on Monday, Macron said he was satisfied with the feedback he had obtained from the Ukrainians on arms deliveries and made the case that France should not descend into a battle of rankings with other countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He argued that France should focus on avoiding escalation, echoing a recent speech in which Macron encouraged France to project itself as “a balancing power” and to “not align itself with more hawkish [countries], which would risk extending the conflict and closing lines of communications.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in a phone call on Saturday, Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed “Ukrainian needs that France could answer,” according to a French readout. No new deliveries have yet been announced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some experts say France could do more to support Ukraine at a moment that could be crucial in the conflict. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have to accelerate weapons deliveries, more tanks, more air defense systems — even if it means letting our stocks drop very low,” said Nicolas Tenzer, an expert on French-Russian relations at Sciences Po.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Tenzer, France’s weapons stocks have suffered in recent years due to budget cuts. But the country could still donate tanks and fighter jets that could be game-changing “if the allied limitation on such weapons was lifted.”</p>\n\n\n\nNATO sends subtle signals\n\n\n\n<p>As Ukraine’s counteroffensive got underway last week, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg was playing his own role in leaning on allies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking alongside U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday, Stoltenberg said he had two messages for NATO members. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first: “We welcome the unprecedented support, we are calling for even more support, and we urge them to dig deeper into the inventories.” The second, he added, “is of course to produce more.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secretary-general’s remarks were interpreted in Berlin as a quiet critique. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stoltenberg’s comments “are a clear message to Lambrecht and Scholz,” said German center-right lawmaker Roderich Kiesewetter, “that their argument of having to hold back weapons for Germany’s defense capabilities or its obligations within NATO is not valid.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On NATO’s eastern flank, meanwhile, allies cautioned that Ukraine’s partners cannot get complacent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It is good to see that Ukraine is doing well, but we cannot forget that a very huge territory is still occupied and the winter is coming,” Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said in a text message. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have to help Ukraine,” he said, “for as much as needed and for as long as needed.” </p>",

        "description": "<p>ATHENS — A persistent espionage scandal has upended Greece’s political landscape, fueling doubts the country can form a stable government after the next election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The controversy started last month when the government acknowledged it had wiretapped an opposition leader’s phone — a move it called legal but wrong. It then quickly blossomed into a labyrinthine story that involved controversial spyware being planted on the phones of an ever-expanding network of politicians and journalists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the government has claimed no connection to — or even knowledge of — these broader cases. And after firing two top government officials, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is now holding firm, insisting he must stay the course amid gathering economic storm clouds, a war raging nearby and increasingly bellicose rhetoric from rival Turkey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m not going to be the overseer of political instability,” Mitsotakis said Saturday night at an annual trade fair in the northern city of Thessaloniki — Greece’s biggest annual political event. “I will lead the country safely to the end of the four-year term and then we will be measured.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The public is split on whether they want to see Mitsotakis stick around until then, though. Two recent polls showed just over half of Greeks feel the prime minister should resign. And with elections set to be held sometime in the next nine months, Mitsotakis’ potential coalition partners are trying to pounce on the crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hanging over everything is the possibility that more espionage plots will emerge. Already, there has been a consistent drip of fresh allegations in the Greek press in recent weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Mitsotakis has reason to be confident that he and his center-right New Democracy party may emerge relatively unscathed. Even though some party members are grumbling about the revelations, New Democracy itself has not suffered in the polls. And voters appear far more focused on the tempestuous economy than they are on espionage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Mitsotakis pledged not to go to elections in autumn, after a good tourist season, but in spring, after a very difficult winter,” said Athanasios Diamantopoulos, a Greek political specialist at Panteion University. “By then, reports of the wiretapping will not have died down, but there will be so many economic troubles that this will be the main stake.”</p>\n\n\n\nCracks from within\n\n\n\n<p>The lingering scandal has not been without consequences — far from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start, there were the resignations, which included one of Mitsotakis’ top aides and his intelligence chief. Those came after the government conceded it had authorized a wiretap of Nikos Androulakis, a European Parliament member who leads the third-largest party in Greece’s parliament, the center-left Pasok.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making matters worse, intrusive spyware known as Predator was also found on Androulakis’ phone, in addition to those of a journalist and lawmakers from the main opposition party, the left-wing Syriza. The government has denied any links to those buggings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, there are lingering questions about what, exactly, occurred. Mitsotakis has refused to explain why his political opponent was spied on, pointing to national security concerns. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The silence has left some New Democracy members uneasy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In such situations, catharsis occurs only when they are fully clarified,” Kostas Karamanlis, a former Greek prime minister and one-time head of New Democracy, said during a recent party event in Crete. “For these events to have been caused by government initiative is not only undemocratic and illegal but so far beyond the bounds of morbid imagination and political nonsense that it is unthinkable.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frustrations have spilled into parliament, where Nikitas Kaklamanis, a New Democracy member and deputy house speaker, said he now opposes a provision he and the ruling party passed depriving citizens of the ability to find out if they are under surveillance. Pasok also initially backed the legislation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New Democracy parliament member Konstantinos Tzavaras even branded the Greek media a “disgrace” for not covering the scandal more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The functioning of the constitution has taken a severe blow and the prime minister must rise to the occasion,” said Tzavaras, one of the party’s representatives in a parliamentary inquiry investigating the issue.</p>\n\n\n\nWith elections set to be held sometime in the next nine months, the public is split on whether they want to see Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis stick around | Aris Messinis/Eurokinissi/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the public reprimands, a full revolt from within the party remains unlikely — the number of disaffected New Democracy figures has not increased in recent days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To some political specialists in the country, Mitsotakis’ staying power is a symptom of a malfunctioning Greek political system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If we were in any democratic state we would not have political instability,” said Nikos Marantzidis, a political science professor at the University of Macedonia. “The PM would have already resigned and succession developments would have been initiated.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitsotakis, Marantzidis argued, “identifies his personal future with the future of democracy and the country when he says that if I resign there will be instability.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitsotakis struck back at that thinking on Sunday, saying: “People know us. If not us, then who?”</p>\n\n\n\nAn eye on elections\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, Mitsotakis is likely to spend the coming months both trying to keep his party together — and trying to navigate an ever-more complicated election, which must be held by next July and is expected to take place in the spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the spying revelations surfaced, New Democracy and Pasok were seen as heading toward forming a centrist coalition government after the upcoming elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s all over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It is now very difficult for Pasok voters to move towards New Democracy, but even more difficult for them to put pressure on their party leadership to participate in a coalition,” said Diamantopoulos, the Greek political specialist at Panteion University.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitsotakis put the blame for that on Androulakis himself, accusing him of playing politics with his surveillance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I believe that what happened helped Androulakis to walk a line that was predetermined, that of rupture with New Democracy,” he said, alleging that the Pasok leader is in “disharmony” with his own voters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Greece’s next national election will be held under a proportional representation system, making it almost impossible for any party to gather a majority. Because of that, the country will most likely head to a second election, which would be held under a system granting bonus seats to the first party. Current polling, however, shows no party close to reaching an absolute majority, even with a second-round bonus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the spying scandal, that reality had fueled expectations that New Democracy and Pasok would be pressed into a coalition. Now, with the two parties squabbling, speculation is running rampant about what coalition formations could emerge from such a divisive moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitsotakis could link up with the nationalist, Russophile Greek Solution party. Yet that would represent a U-turn for the prime minister, who styles himself as a moderate and pro-U.S. politician.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Sunday, Mitsotakis said that he doesn’t feel “at all close” to Greek Solution but didn’t exclude a potential tie-up, arguing he is “not ready to talk about what the options will be” if a coalition is needed. He also left open the option of teaming up with specific lawmakers from various political parties to bolster his standing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remarkably, a team-up between New Democracy and Pasok is still on the table, according to political analysts in Athens — but realistically only without Mitsotakis as the prime minister. That’s not something Mitsotakis will likely go for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The leader of the first party must be the prime minister, even in the case of a coalition government,” the prime minister underlined on Sunday. </p>\n\n\n\nGREEK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3 Years\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 Years\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Year\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t6 Months\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKalman Smooth\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKalman\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>For more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, a grand coalition between New Democracy, Pasok and Syriza — an approach Pasok favors — would likely require new leadership within New Democracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is possible, but won’t be simple,” said Marantzidis, the political science professor. “As long as [Mitsotakis] identifies his personal future with the future of democracy and the country, this will have a negative impact on developments after the elections.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitsotakis himself warned against another possibility — a coalition that pulls together all the center-left and left-wing opposition parties to form a government omitting New Democracy, even if it finishes first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This will be a political monstrosity and I have to inform and warn people about this possibility,” Mitsotakis said.</p>\n\n\n\nPolls hold steady\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the rapidly shifting political dynamics, polling last week showed limited damage to the government over the spy scandal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the poll, New Democracy has only slid between 0.2 and 1.7 percentage points since the scandal erupted. Meanwhile, opposition parties Syriza and Pasok merely gained between 0.5 and 1 percentage point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have been surprised by the short-term reactions in the past,” said Giorgos Arapoglou, the general manager of Pulse polling company. Arapoglou recalled that after a massive 2018 fire that saw 100 people perish, the government first gained in the polls before losing power in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, Arapoglou said the economy is usually the biggest factor in elections. Recent polls back up his theory. In a Marc survey, 84 percent of Greeks said they were concerned about inflation and the looming energy crisis this winter. Only 16 percent expressed worries about the wiretapping discoveries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When just considering politics, though, the espionage story does seem to loom large. A recent GPO poll showed nearly 70 percent of Greeks thought the case was a “very” or “quite” important part of the current political scene. Well over half, 59 percent, also thought Mitsotakis bore some responsibility, while about the same amount said the case had diminished their trust in government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And notably, multiple polls show a slim majority wants Mitsotakis to step aside — a Public Issue poll had it at 54 percent, while a ProRata poll put it at 51 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some political analysts believe it’s just a matter of time until the issue catches up with the prime minister.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Obviously the government strategy is to forget what is happening,” said Marantzidis. “But,” he added, “one way or the other, just as Nixon didn’t avoid the truth, Mitsotakis will not be able to avoid it either.”</p>",

        "description": "Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>The Astros are heating up for the playoffs</p> <p>We must retire the word Framberin from the dictionary of baseball slang. Framberin no longer exists. Defined as erratic and wild pitching that somehow manages to limit runs through luck and ground out double plays, the inventor, namesake, and master of Framberin is no longer our beloved “Framberin Man.”</p>\n<p>Framber Valdez has matured into as rock solid and dependable a pitcher as any in baseball. Today he reached the pinnacle, a complete game shutout, rare in the contemporary game, efficiently dispatching the Detroit Tigers with only 107 pitches and allowing only one walk en route to an Astros 7-0 victory.</p>\n<p>It was his 24th consecutive quality start, approaching the all-time record, 26, held by the legendary Bob Gibson in the asterisk year (for pitchers) of 1968. It also ties Jacob DeGrom’s single-season record.</p>\n<p>But the Astros bats had a day too.</p>\n<p>The Stros offense can get you any way they want. Sunday it was with five homers. But under old-school manager Dusty Baker they can kill you with small ball too. And thus, that is how the Astros started this game in Detroit. Three singles by Jose Altuve, Jeremy Pena, and Alex Bregman yielded two runs with the help of stolen bases by Altuve (17) and Pena (10).</p>\n<p>The Astros saved a run in the bottom of the first on an outstanding defensive play by first baseman Yuli Gurriel, who gunned down Riley Green at home on a fielder’s choice.</p>\n<p>And in the bottom of the third ace-fielding, rifle-armed left-fielder Yordan Alvarez got his seventh outfield assist by gunning down Will Castro at home, saving a run and Framber’s shutout for the third out of the inning.</p>\n\n\n<p>Don't test him. pic.twitter.com/SMsZsSPev4</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 12, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>And in the third inning, smart baserunning helped produce another Astros run. With runners on first and third and one out, Kyle Tucker hit a grounder to second. Alex Bregman avoided a quick tag by the second baseman, avoiding a quick force double play, allowing the runner from third to score. The Tigers did get a double play, 4-3-6, but by avoiding the easy tag, Bregman gave the runner on third enough time to score before he was eventually tagged out sliding into second from the throw by the first baseman.</p>\n<p>The Astros added a couple more off of Tigers starter Ed Rodriguez in the fifth inning, starting with a Pena double followed by an Alvarez single, advancing Pena to third base. </p>\n<p>Smart baserunning helped the Astros yet again. Although a sharp Bregman grounder to third offered Pena no choice but to head home for a sure out, he managed to stay in a rundown long enough to allow Alvarez to take third and Bregman to advance all the way to second base. A Kyle Tucker groundout allowed Alvarez to score, and a Yuli Gurriel double plated Bregman.</p>\n\n\n<p>Five runs through five. pic.twitter.com/xAvsydCz3s</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 13, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Although we must preface a discussion of Framber Valdez’s performance with the disclaimer that the Tigers are the worst hitting team in baseball, they still do manage to score runs in most games. Tonight, Valdez held the Tigers scoreless for nine innings,  allowing six hits and one walk while whiffing eight Tigers. He threw 72 of his 107 pitches for strikes and got nine groundouts to four flyouts, including one double play. Valdez’s season ERA is down to 2.50.</p>\n<p>It was the second complete game in Valdez’s career and his first complete game shutout. And it was also, of course, his 24th consecutive quality start.</p>\n<p>As already stated, Valdez got great help from his defense, including plays like this.</p>\n\n\n<p>Barehand Breggy.   pic.twitter.com/cMh3E7AXHk</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 13, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The offense tonight was led by the top of the order, with Altuve, Alvarez, and Bregman, 1, 3, and 4 hitters, respectively, all having two hits. The 2-hole batter, Jeremy Pena, had three hits, a double, two runs, and an RBI to lift his season BA over .250, and he, along with Alvarez, seem to be heating up nicely ahead of the playoffs.</p>\n<p>The five-hitter, Kyle Tucker, was one for five but had a two-RBI single in the ninth inning to increase the Astros lead to 7-0.</p>\n\n\n<p>Run support. pic.twitter.com/0pEwqGekP6</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 13, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The Astros chug inexorably along to a 100+ win season against all expectations. And they open their lead in the overall AL standing to six games.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow they send the rookie phenom Hunter Brown to the mound as he tries to stake a late claim to a place on the playoff roster.</p>\n<p>Game time another early start, 5:40 CT</p>\n<p>Box score and videos HERE.</p>\n<p>Note: Did you know that among his many other records, Babe Ruth is fourth all-time in the percentage of quality starts, 71.4%, behind Jacob DeGrom, Clayton Kershaw, and Jeff Tesrau. And ahead of notables like Tom Seaver, Chris Sale, Gerrit Cole (and those are just in the top ten)</p>",

        "description": "<p>Martin Short delivered a barb aimed at former President Trump's handling of classified documents while appearing Monday at the Emmy Awards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Really, what an audience you are,\" the \"Only Murders in the Building\" star exclaimed as he took to the Primetime Emmy Awards stage in Los Angeles to present the award in the best variety talk series category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I wish I could box you up and take you home, like classified White House documents,\" Short, 72, quipped to laughs from the audience at the 74th annual awards show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump’s legal team fought a request from the Department of Justice to allow its review of classified materials taken from Mar-a-Lago, the ex-president's Florida resort home, to continue in a Monday court filing. The investigation, Trump’s lawyers said in the filing, “at its core is a document storage dispute that has spiraled out of control.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Short's quip came during a largely politics-free night at the Emmys, the performer has said in the past that he's purposely avoided Trump-related zingers. In a 2018 Netflix special with fellow comedian Steve Martin, Short said the pair opted not to make mention of the then-commander in chief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Steve and I have great respect for the fact that we don’t just want a liberal audience,\" the actor told The Daily Beast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So that’s why we deliberately do not mention Donald Trump,” he said at the time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“But as far as the Trump presidency, I wouldn’t even call it a presidency. It’s an asterisk. It’s a typo,\" Short said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I mean, every day it’s worse and 10 years from now the history books will be having a field day with it and the shame of the people who supported him, if they’re still around, in the sense of being in the public eye, will be like the people who supported [late Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.)],” he said.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Chris Bassitt struggled for the first time in a while, and the Mets offense was unable to get much going.</p> <p>For the third straight series, the Mets dropped the first game of a three-game set against a team with a record well below .500, losing to the Cubs 5-2</p>\n<p>Chris Bassitt got the start for the Mets, and after a nearly three month long stretch of stellar pitching, Bassitt finally ran into trouble and struggled. In the second inning, the Cubs got on the board thanks to a solo home run off the bat of Rafael Ortega. The long ball continued to give Bassitt trouble in the third inning, as Zach McKinstry hit a two-run homer, putting the Cubs up 3-0. In the fourth inning, the Cubs made life difficult for Bassitt yet again, as they put up their fourth and fifth runs of the game, ending Bassitt’s night. Bassitt’s final line was 3.2 innings pitched, while allowing five runs on five hits, with two walks. On the night, Bassitt threw 73 pitches.</p>\n<p>At the plate, the Mets’ scored one of their two runs in the bottom of the fourth inning, thanks to the recently surging James McCann, as he drove home Mark Canha with an RBI single. The Mets tacked on a second run in the bottom of the ninth with two outs as Francisco Lindor hit a solo home run.</p>\n<p>However, the story of the night was the men left on base by the Mets’ offense, in both the first and eighth innings. In both instances, the team was able to load the bases with less than two outs, and both times, the Mets came away empty handed, just about ruining any chance they had in competing in this game. In total, the Mets left 21 men on base, a rather high number.</p>\n<p>The lone bright spot on the night was the bullpen of the Mets, who pitched 5.1 scoreless innings in relief of the starter Bassitt, giving the Mets a chance in theory to stay in the game.  They will now await the result of the Braves vs. Giants game to see if their lead in the NL East remains at 1.5 games, or shrinks to 0.5 games.</p>\nSB Nation GameThreads\n<p>Amazin’ Avenue</p>\n<p>Bleed Cubbie Blue</p>\nBox scores\n<p>ESPN</p>\n<p>MLB</p>\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs.com\n  \n<p>What’s WPA?</p>\n<p>Big Mets winner: Daniel Vogelbach, +9% WPABig Mets loser: Chris Bassitt, -29% WPAMets pitchers: -25% WPAMets hitters: -25% WPATeh aw3s0mest play: James McCann’s RBI single in the bottom of the fourth, +4.5% WPATeh sux0rest play: Zach McKinstry’s two-run homer in the top of the third inning, +17.9% WPA</p>\n<p></p>",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/marlins-planning-to-retain-gm-kim-ng.html",
        "description": "<p>The Marlins are planning to bring back general manager Kim Ng, reports Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald. He adds that Ng and owner Bruce Sherman met last week as the organization charts out a plan for the upcoming offseason.</p>\n<p>It’s not particularly surprising, as there’s never been any indication Sherman was seriously considering replacing Ng. First hired over the 2020-21 offseason, Ng has been at the helm of the front office for the past two years. Much of that time was spent working alongside CEO Derek Jeter and vice president of scouting/player development Gary Denbo, but both have moved on from the franchise in recent months. Jeter stepped down in February, while Denbo was let go at the end of June. Sherman, for his part, indicated he’ll remain in his role for the long haul. He tells Jackson he has “never considered” selling the team and is “more deeply invested in the team’s success now than ever.”</p>\n<p>While Ng will hold onto her position at the top of the front office, Jackson reports that Miami is expected to make some changes both at the lower levels of the front office and on the major league coaching staff. Whether that extends to manager Don Mattingly remains to be seen, but the skipper is believed to be in the final year of his contract. Both Mattingly and the Marlins picked up a 2022 mutual option on his deal last July, but there’s no indication the sides have extended their relationship beyond this year.</p>\n<p>Hired in November 2015, Mattingly has spent the past seven seasons running the show in South Florida. He’s the second-longest tenured skipper in the National League behind Milwaukee’s Craig Counsell and the fifth-longest tenured in the majors, but the Marlins carry a 431-576 record (.428 win percentage) over that stretch. The Fish were rebuilding early in his tenure, but they’d hoped to turn a corner after earning a playoff berth during the abbreviated 2020 campaign.</p>\n<p>Competing over a full schedule in 2021 may have been too optimistic for such a young roster, but a 67-95 showing had to be a disappointment. Even more deflating, Miami is trending towards a similar result this year. That’s in spite of a relatively aggressive offseason (at least by the franchise’s standards), in which the Fish brought in Avisaíl García and Jorge Soler on multi-year free agent deals and acquired Joey Wendle and Jacob Stallings via trade. All four of those players have underwhelmed to varying degrees, and the Marlins have again trotted out one of the sport’s most punchless offenses. Miami entered play Monday ranked 27th in on-base percentage (.294) and 28th in slugging (.363).</p>\n<p>Speaking with Jackson, Sherman acknowledged the team’s performance this year “has been immensely frustrating.” He indicated the club believed they’d be capable of contending for a playoff spot entering the season and admitted “we were not as good as we thought we’d be.” Sherman indicated they’d take another shot at competing in 2023 and weren’t planning to orchestrate another rebuild.</p>\n<p>That aligns with recent reports that the club intends to again look for offensive help, perhaps by dangling some of its controllable pitching in trade. Asked by Jackson whether the lackluster early returns on the Soler and García contracts would deter the team from dipping into free agency, Sherman said “no” and indicated they’d “continue to explore all options” to talent acquisition. At the same time, he largely demurred when asked about the payroll, noting only that he “(expects) to continue to invest once again in our Major League payroll in 2023.”</p>\n<p>Spending is an ever-present question for the Marlins, who haven’t exceeded $80MM in Opening Day payroll in any of the past four seasons (according to Cot’s Baseball Contracts). This year’s roughly $79.6MM mark ranks 26th leaguewide. Miami has roughly $45MM in guaranteed commitments on the books for next season, in the estimation of Jason Martinez of Roster Resource. That doesn’t include potential arbitration raises for players like Wendle, Brian Anderson, Pablo López, Garrett Cooper, Stallings and Jon Berti, though. Some members of that group are likely to be traded or non-tendered, but the available payroll space could dry up relatively quickly if Miami’s not willing to push much past this year’s spending level. That’d leave a challenging task for Ng and her front office to construct a roster capable of contending for the organization’s first playoff spot in a 162-game season since 2003.</p>",

        "description": "<p>September 12, 2022</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor passed away last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was known to the world as Queen Elizabeth II, because she was the second person named Elizabeth to occupy the British throne as Queen of the United Kingdom. “Queen” was her job title, not something that inhered in her being or was her identity at birth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By all accounts she was a good woman with a strong sense of duty who did many good things and inspired many people. It is said that she was loved by many citizens of Great Britain, though surely most of those who are said to have “loved” her never knew her, and merely loved what she represented to them, whether dignity, or love of country, or tradition. And while she represented this to many, she represented no one in the modern legal-political sense. For she stood in no relationship of accountability to citizens, and was elected by no one, having been selected, based on her family lineage, according to an old and rather obscure process that culminates in what the British call “ascension.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel for the many people who grieve her passing, which include many friends across the world, good and smart people who sincerely admired her as a person and regarded her as a symbol of decency and moderation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do not share this feeling. Elizabeth was nothing to me. For I am a citizen of a country born in revolution against the British monarchy, and a person who basically agrees with those, like Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson, who argued long ago that hereditary monarchy and indeed any kind of “aristocracy” is both absurd and unjust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, I have found the Schadenfreude expressed by many—whether they be died-in-the-wool “republicans,” self-styled “Jacobins,” or post-colonials who legitimately despise the British empire—to be kind of obnoxious. Because it is almost always in bad taste to exult in the passing of a person who has done no real harm, who had family or friends who loved them, and who in the end was simply a mortal, like the rest of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Note: for me there are exceptions to this “rule.” I once engaged in a heated debate with friends who were horrified when I declared that if Donald Trump were sitting at the next table and he was choking to death, I would not lift a finger to help him. There are some people who are simply malevolent, who do real harm, and whose death is legitimately to be celebrated. But Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor, the Queen of Great Britain, was no such person.]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am instinctively averse to foolish sentimentalism. I am also very aware of the many brutal injustices perpetrated by the British empire, even under the “reign” of the relatively “liberal” Elizabeth. These are reasons to be revolted—pun intended– by the incredible displays of mourning for Elizabeth that are also displays of sentimental reverence for the British royal family and for the British empire—a kind of “Make Great Britain Great Again.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I am personally inclined to bracket such reactions even as I experience them. Because they are a little too moralistic, a little too insensitive to the fact that there really are others that feel differently, and love the pageantry, in the same way that they might love to watch the U.S. Open or the Academy Awards or to attend a live performance of Beyonce or Paul McCartney or even Justin Bieber. I would not disparage someone for mourning the murder of John Lennon or the retirement of Serena Williams or perhaps even the ending of “Game of Thrones.” People are entitled to their sentimentality and their sadness. (I still mourn the cancelation of the Gothic soap opera “Dark Shadows” back in 1971.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My problem is not with personal reactions to Elizabeth’s passing, but with the U.S. media coverage of it, and my reason is simple: because the manner of this coverage encourages a kind of political foolishness that is especially serious at this moment, a moment in which we are in the midst of a very real crisis of democracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One form this foolishness takes is simple but frustrating distraction. I am an avid watcher of CNN and MSNBC, important sources of hourly news for me. But since the death of Elizabeth, it has been impossible to “learn” about anything but Elizabeth’s death, the saga of the royal family, and the public displays of grief at her passing and excitement about the ascension to the throne of her elder son Charles. Nothing else has been covered. As if this exhausts the world. As if everything that is regularly featured is not important. Yesterday—Sunday—both cable news networks carried relentless aerial footage of the hearse carrying Elizabeth’s casket in a way that literally recalled the famous television coverage of O.J. Simpson fleeing arrest in his white Ford Bronco. This kind of sensationalist coverage obviously bespeaks deeper problems with television news and the “news” media more generally. But on its face, it represents a stunning failure of “news media” to cover genuinely important news, both “domestic” and global, at a time when public awareness has never been more urgent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second form this foolishness takes is sheer stupidity in otherwise intelligent commentators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Friday night, MSNBC reporter Matt Bradley exulted in the majesty of British custom, quoting the famous 19thcentury conservative Walter Bagehot, who wrote of the royal family that “We should not let sunlight shine in on the magic.” The magic? What? (Bradley also called Bagehot “the greatest Victorian”—a label taken straight from the titleof a 1998 Roger Kimball New Criterion essay; one wonders if Bradley had any idea that he was quoting a right-wing crank who has long railed against “the liberal media” and has become one of Donald Trump’s chief cheerleaders).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on Saturday morning the indefatigable Katy Tur, on special assignment in London, shared with her audience how poignant it is for her to hear Briton’s shouting “God Save the King,” considering that “for sixty years we have gotten used to hearing God save the Queen.” Really? We have? Who exactly is this “we” here? Tur is a brilliant young journalist. Does she even realize what she is saying?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this leads me to the third and most dangerous form of foolishness associated with the U.S. media coverage of the current drama of the British royal family: the celebration of monarchy at a moment when it has never been more important for Americans to focus on the vulnerabilities and assaults currently weakening constitutional democracy in the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now the Trump-led, MAGA-committed Republican party is doing everything it can to undermine the basic principles of equal justice under the law, free and fair elections in which every citizen’s vote counts equally, and democratic legitimacy. Right now Trump is acting like a wannabe monarch, and his party is defending the idea that as President his wish was his command and even now he retains a magical “executive privilege.” This conduct is everywhere, it is truly dangerous, and it is inciting real violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What can it mean, right now, in the face of this, to participate in the spectacular exaltation of a Queen, the King who has succeeded her, and a “royal family”–heirs to a form of wealth, title, and authority that is utterly at odds with the core beliefs of what we claim is our democracy? How can anyone in good conscience declare “noone is above the law” while simultaneously celebrating an entire family that acts as if it were better than everyone else and is treated this way by an entire “kingdom?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elizabeth has passed away. Tributes have been paid, and they will continue. May she rest in peace, and many her family grieve just as all families grieve the loss of a loved one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And right now, every minute that Americans are encouraged to revere the British royal family and its historic “greatness,” is a minute of forgetfulness of our own freedom and our own political responsibilities as people who are not royal subjects but citizens of a putative democracy. </p>",

        "description": "<p>September 9, 2022</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Labor Day became a national holiday on June 28, 1894. Signed into law by Democratic President Grover Cleveland, it was precipitated by the great Pullman Strike of that summer led by Eugene V. Debs, and it was a lame act of conciliation whose failure led to the violent suppression of the strike by federal troops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The holiday has long been regarded as a symbolic triumph of the labor movement and its egalitarian struggles on behalf of the recognition and empowerment of working people, and rightly so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But fascists can also lay claim to it, or at least act as if they do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last weekend, approximately 75 fascists associated with the far-right Patriot Front did just that in a well-publicized march from the Indiana Statehouse through downtown Indianapolis. Masked and dressed in uniform khakis, marching in military formation, and carrying the group’s Logo–a fascist-inflected Betsy Ross flag—these “patriots” chanted “Reclaim America” while carrying a banner declaring “America is not for sale.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That Patriot Front is a fascist group is not in doubt (see recent reports by the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League, and the Monterey Middlebury Institute’s Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism). Founded after the violent 2017 Charlottesville “Unite the Right” rally, the group broke away from its parent organization, Vanguard America, supposedly because of that group’s explicit Nazism.  But Patriot Front’s version of fascism, however kinder and gentler it might seem, is no less violent, militant, and white supremacist than its forbear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In good fascist form, the group’s “Manifesto” leads with a (misleading) quotation from George Washington that declares “we have therefore to resolve to conquer or die.” Featuring quotations from a wide range of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant “heroes,” from Washington and Thomas Jefferson to Robert E. Lee and Charles Lindbergh, the text projects a nightmare vision of an “America” that is conquered, defeated, and demoralized by “foreign elements” and those alien to the “original stock” of “pioneers and conquerors” who, possessing “a precious inheritance . . . of European blood” first Made American Great. “American carnage” in the extreme. Extolling purifying violence and relentless struggle on behalf of “national heritage” and “national spirit,” the Patriot Front seeks to “Reclaim America” for white Americans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group centers its mobilization on race. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also claims to stand for economic justice for white Americans. Its “Manifesto” denounces “globalization,” “plutocracy,” “cultural tyranny,” and consumerism (“the habit of consumption”), and exalts an almost utopian vision of “family, community, nation.” (“His nation will be an extended family, not a land of strangers where once a people stood. He will no longer be sold a life that will never come; a life of working for something that is neither rewarding nor spiritually beneficial.” The only thing missing here is hunting in the morning and fishing in the afternoon . . . . )</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how the Patriot Front march in Indianapolis is described on the group’s website:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activists held a march through Indianapolis, Indiana in recognition of Labor Day. The march proceeded past the State Capitol as activists marched through over a mile of downtown without incident. These actions were carried out for the defense of American labor, in protest to the greed of current corporate and financial systems, and the memory of the Americans who built this country. A speech was given on the steps of the Indiana War Memorial. “The corporate gangster cares little if his workers are divided by a dozen languages and a dozen faiths, his god is greed and his language is money.” […] “It is clear we cannot ask the government or the corporations to redress these grievances, so we must embody the solutions ourselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This anti-corporate, class dimension of the group’s rhetoric should not be surprising. For fascism has always incorporated a populist appeal to the subaltern masses of the aggrieved nation. The German Nazi Party, after all, was named the “National Socialist German Workers’ Party.” Indeed, Patriot Front’s origins are linked to another fascist group, the Traditionalist Worker Party, which once claimed to be the “first political party created by and for working families.” White working families, of course, dutifully structured in a “traditional,” i.e., patriarchal, form. This explicitly racist, anti-Semitic, and Nazi-sympathizing group played an important role in organizing the “Unite the Right” rally and, like other organizations behind the march, a guilty verdict in a 2021 federal civil trial led to its eventual dissolution.  One of the group’s founders, Matthew Heimbach–who in 2018 was arrested at a Paoli, Indiana trailer park in a domestic battery dispute–has described himself as follower of Gregor Strasser, the “leftist” Nazi murdered by Hitler’s Gestapo in the famous June 1934 Night of the Long Knives. And in the spirit brown-red unity, in June of 2021  he announced the intention to relaunch the Traditionalist Workers’ Party as a “National Bolshevik” party. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heilbach is a crank—though a dangerous one. And few of these assorted groupings on the very far right are extremely large. But they operate in every state, enjoy substantial overlap and cross-pollination, and have substantial scope and reach, especially on social media. According to the Counter Extremism Project, subscriptions to the Patriot Front main Telegram channel rose from 2500 in June 2020 to around 14,000 by May of 2022. Such groups are part of the broader network of far-right groups and looser networks–whose more “respectable” members include Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, etc.—that is now considered by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to comprise the most dangerous “terrorist threat” to the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These groups are racist and they are dangerous. Their most obvious danger resides in the acts of provocation and violence performed by their members, sometimes in concert, sometimes in less organized ways (though even misleadingly called “lone wolf” terrorists are part of broader networks). But perhaps even more dangerous is their ability to disseminate a populist-sounding message of resentment that resonates far beyond the narrow circles of Nazi sympathizers, and contributes to a broader poisoning of public attitudes, especially among young people, a poisoning that clearly feeds the broader MAGA movement at the same time that it foods off of it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For, truth be told, there is little distance separating what these groups say and do from the rhetoric of MAGA leaders like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, Doug Mastriano, Greg Gianforte, and Donald Trump himself. Whole sections of the Patriot Front’s “Manifesto” could be lifted from a Trump speech—or be lifted by Trump into one of his speeches. It would not be a stretch to imagine the “Manifesto’s” author showing up one day soon in the pages of American Greatness or The American Mind, two of the most populistic MAGA outlets, talking about the need to rescue America’s “heartland” farmers and workers from evil, globalist, i.e., rootlessly cosmopolitan, liberal elites—you know, like the insidious, and Jewish, George Soros.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if one source of this rhetoric’s appeal is profound racial and gender resentment, another is a kind of white working-class populism of the sort popularized by J.D. Vance and Tucker Carlson. This populism is currently being promoted in a big way by Missouri’s Republican Senator Josh Hawley, a young, ambitious, and cynical opportunist who claims to stand for a new “communitarian nationalism” that can rescue the U.S. from neoliberal trade policy, Silicon Valley elitists, and a liberal cultural “overclass” that keeps the masses in thrall. Indeed, the new journal Compact, which launched this past March, promises just such a “red-brown” message—though, as Scott Lemieux has rightly noted, such red-brown alliances are “just brown.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is tempting to regard Patriot Front’s Indianapolis Labor Day event as nothing but a publicity stunt by a small group of crazies. And it is surely a good thing that the city’s Democratic Mayor, Joe Hogsett, quickly denounced the march, declaring that “hate has no place in Indianapolis. The individuals who marched downtown yesterday do not represent the values of our community and we condemn their message in the strongest possible terms.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, Indiana is a solidly red state that went strongly for Trump in 2016 and 2020, and whose leading Republicans—Mike Pence, Sen. Mike Braun, Attorney General Todd Rokita, and Governor Eric Holcomb—lean far to the right. Braun won his Senate seat in 2018 by running a spate of Trumpist ads denouncing “illegal immigrants,” “sanctuary cities,” and “resistance” protests. In this year’s recent Republican primary, former Pence aide Diego Morales won the Secretary of State nomination by promoting Trump’s “Big Lie” and promising that if he is elected, he will use his power to make sure that the “theft” of the 2020 election by Democrats will never happen again.  And of course, Rokita has recently stepped forward as a national leader in the state Republican effort to pass sweeping anti-abortion laws and to enforce these laws with scrupulous cruelty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My point: when viewed in a broader ideological and political perspective, the Patriot Front’s Labor Day march in Indianapolis can be seen as both drawing on a deep reservoir of anti-liberal resentment and as contributing to the further poisoning of this reservoir.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This phenomenon is national and indeed global. And it is dangerous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citizens who care about democracy should do everything they can to monitor and to oppose such groups. This means refusing to allow them to lay claim to major national holidays like Labor Day. But this also means doing everything possible to infuse these holidays with real meaning, by defending the institutions of egalitarian democratic citizenship, and also by using these institutions to promote a truly “more just and perfect union.”</p>",

        "link": "https://jeffreycisaacdesign.wordpress.com/2022/09/05/thinking-about-biden-fdr-and-democracy-on-labor-day-2022/",
        "description": "<p>September 5, 2022</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe Biden’s election in 2020 was surrounded by an extraordinary outpouring of commentary about whether he could be this generation’s FDR, and his “Build Back Better” agenda could be a transformational agenda equivalent to the New Deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This expectation, which many, myself included, considered mistaken, was soon proven wrong, as a combination of razor-thin Democratic majorities in Congress, Biden’s own timidity, and unyielding Republican obstruction led to the defeat of the most ambitious political proposals—the For the People Act, the John Lewis Voting Rights Enhancement Act, and the labor-friendly PRO-Act—and the dramatic scaling back of the most ambitious “Build Back Better” social and economic policy ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden is no FDR, and his administration will bring forth no New Deal, even if he has lately scored some legislative “victories.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this does not make the parallels completely mistaken. And the most obvious parallel is simply that both Democratic presidents were elected amidst great crises in which the future of democracy itself was placed in question through a combination of global and domestic enemies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This parallel has received renewed attention in connection with Biden’s so-called “Soul of the Nation” speech last week, in which he stated very clearly that the Trumpist movement, and the forces of MAGA Republicanism, pose a fundamental threat to democracy. Presidential historian Michael Bechloss, a regular talking head on MSNBC, was most explicit about this parallel while speaking on “All In With Chris Hayes”: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“1940, when Franklin Roosevelt was running for a third term. . .  Roosevelt didn’t say ‘the paramount issue this year is the minimum wage,’ although that was pretty important, or whether Texans get an oil depletion allowance or something like this . . . He said, ‘Look, these are all important, but what is really at stake at this moment is whether our children are going to get to live in an American democracy, especially with Hitler and the fascists looming in Europe and marching.’”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bechloss not wrong to emphasize the importance of FDR’s rhetoric of democracy in the lead up to WWII, when FDR gave two of his most important speeches on the topic, his December 29, 1940 “Arsenal of Democracy” and his January 6, 1941 “Four Freedoms.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he is wrong to locate FDR’s anti-fascist rhetoric only in the lead-up to war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the theme of the threat to democracy shaped FDR’s entire presidency, going back to his 1932 campaign. And perhaps the FDR speech that most resembles Biden’s in its democratic anti-fascism was his famous renomination acceptance speech, also given in Independence Hall, on June 27, 1936. This speech, often referred to as the “Rendezvous with Destiny” speech, is probably the most radical speech in U.S. presidential history, and the reason is simple: because it is the presidential speech most centered on what can only be called class struggle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beginning with a reference to the “clouds of suspicion, tides of ill-will, and intolerance [that] gather darkly in many places,” FDR immediately pivots to the need to address the challenges of freedom in the face of the current darkness, and “to give to 1936 what the founders gave to 1776”—a reinvigorated “American way of life.” What follows is a powerful critique of the “economic royalists” whose predation of ordinary working Americans—subjected to what FDR calls “economic slavery”– parallels the “despotism” of George III, and an equally powerful defense of a social democratic agenda premised on the idea that “freedom is no half-and-half affair. If the average citizen is guaranteed equal opportunity in the polling place, he must have equal opportunity in the market place.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When FDR gave the speech, he had already secured passage of the Social Security Act and the National Labor Relations Act, and he faced relentless attacks from the right that he was a “socialist” or even “Communist.” He well understood that fascism was ascendant in Europe and that fascist groups in the U.S. were actively opposing both his administration and democracy itself (it is worth noting that while Father Charles Coughlin, Gerald K. Smith, and a range of other fascist sympathizers had strong followings during this period, the Republican party itself was not then fascist or “semi-fascist” in the manner of today’s MAGA Republican party).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And FDR also understood that the fight for democracy must also be a fight for social justice. This was his central theme as he won landslide re-election in 1936, and it was his central theme in his 1941 “Four Freedoms” speech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is any day on which it is important to remember this connection between the defense of democracy and the defense of the labor movement and social and economic rights more generally, it is today, on Labor Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FDR understood this connection, and so too does Joe Biden, who made clear in his speech that democracy is both valuable in itself, and also an indispensable means for promoting public policies that improve the lives of ordinary working Americans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden today understands, as FDR understood in 1940, that imminent threats to democracy require a broad-based coalition politics, a kind of “democratic united front” that gives pride of place to the defense of democratic procedures and the rule of law and places a temporary hold on more ambitious social and economic reforms. But he also understands that “delivering” for the citizenry is an essential dimension of democratic self-defense, and that the promise of a more just, social democracy should always be kept alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He understands what FDR understood back in 1936: “here in America we are waging a great and successful war. It is not alone a war against want and destitution and economic demoralization. It is more than that; it is a war for the survival of democracy. We are fighting to save a great and precious form of government for ourselves and for the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are still fighting this fight. And Labor Day is a good day to remember that what hangs in the balance is not only precious political principles and formal arrangements, but the promise of a better life, and a better future, for the ordinary working Americans who comprise the vast majority of the society that democracy is supposed to serve.</p>",

        "link": "https://jeffreycisaacdesign.wordpress.com/2022/09/01/president-bidens-democracy-speech-was-perfect/",
        "description": "<p>Thursday, September 1, 2022</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am rarely awestruck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just watched and listened to President Joe Biden deliver his “Soul of the Nation” speech at Philadelphia’s Independence Hall. And I am in awe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The speech was perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It brilliantly and beautifully articulated the three things that most need saying right now in the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First: constitutional democracy is a flawed but also liberating historical achievement—Biden neatly outlined the history– because it makes it possible for a pluralistic country to resolve inevitable and valuable conflicts without organized violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second: this democracy is currently under concerted attack by a Republican party that is dominated by Trump and MAGA Republicans, that is violent and dangerous and that must be opposed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third: Americans are not mere bystanders, and it is necessary for us to defend this democracy if we wish to prevent a rollback of essential freedoms and to make possible a better future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The speech said all of this much more eloquently than any summary can capture. At the same time, at a tight 25 minutes, it was engaging, easy to follow, and delivered by Biden with rare oratorical excellence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was only a speech. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But so much of politics is words. And so many of the words we have lately been barraged with are so awful, frightening, dispiriting, dangerous. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These words were true. And they needed to be said by the President, loudly and in primetime, and they needed to be said now. And he said them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden needs to keep saying them. As often as possible. All of them, the part about the value of democracy, and about the dangers to democracy, and about the possibility of progress through democracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not all that needs to be done, obviously. But it’s something. The words matter, and they can explain, and motivate, if they are said well, and repeated by others, and incorporated in real campaigns, organizing efforts and voting drives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What President Biden said tonight is true: the civil liberties we prize, and the democratic freedoms that support them, are all being threatened by the MAGA movement that controls the Republican party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they win, we lose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenges are much deeper, and the stakes much bigger, than the outcome of this year’s election and the one to follow in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But right now every Republican victory brings us one step closer to autocracy, while every Democratic victory makes at least the possibility of improvement possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so these elections matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Biden’s words made clear, nothing less than democracy itself is on the ballot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can’t afford for it to lose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>August 11, 2022</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Today and everyday is 1776. Never give up our freedoms. Never let the left steal them away. Be a watchman on the wall and stay guard every single second of every single day because the left will stop at nothing until they destroy our faith, our families, and our freedoms.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>-Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, April 23, 2022 on Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Congresswoman Greene, they got away with fixing elections in plain sight. It’s over. The next step is the one we used in 1775.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>–Ricky Shiffer, May 7 on Truth Social </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past few days Marjorie Taylor Greene has been very busy posting and re-posting denunciations of the Justice Department and the FBI for “the political persecution of Donald J. Trump,”  the “intimidation” of her MAGA followers, and “doing the dirty work of a communist regime.”  “This is the type of rogue tactics that happen in countries right before they fall into tyrannical dictatorships,” she declared. “No one should tolerate this!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ricky Shiffer clearly pays attention. Over the past few days he too had been posting his own denunciations on Truth Social, the cynically-named Trumpist social media network, culminating in the assertion that “we must not tolerate this one.” He followed up on Thursday by attempting to storm the FBI office in Cincinnati–firing a nail gun and apparently carrying an AR-15 rifle as well–where he was repelled by police and eventually killed in a gun battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shiffer was a dedicated MAGA fanatic who was present at the Capitol on January 6 and who regularly used social media to imbibe and to spread the MAGA message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His attack on the FBI was precipitated by an intense media barrage by Donald Trump and his supporters angrily denouncing the FBI’s legal search of Trump’s Mar-A-Lago property. From the very start, these denunciations were accompanied by an “unhinged fury” of calls for violence against law enforcement officials so intense that FBI Director Christopher Wray, a Trump appointee back in 2017, was forced to name and to denounce them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The situation surrounding the FBI search seems to be intensifying, as Trumpist rhetoric escalates and the MAGA base responds to the call. Nothing about this situation should be surprising. The violence of the MAGA movement has been close to the surface when not out in the open for the past five years, and Trump has long proven to be expert at its provocation and incitement. Hannah Allam put it well in the Washington Post: “Simmering threat of violence comes to the fore with search of Trump property.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is nothing new here, except that the situation is becoming increasingly dangerous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, one dimension of the situation is very old indeed, and it is encapsulated by the posts by Taylor Greene and Shiffer quoted at the very top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taylor Greene’s “1776” rhetoric has by now become boilerplate on the MAGA right, whose adherents claim to stand for “the spirit of 1776” and to be the true, patriotic heirs of the American Revolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what could Shiffer,  Taylor Greene’s loyal follower, have meant by the “step . . . we used in 1775?” Perhaps Shiffer simply mixed up his dates. But not likely. Because for MAGA “patriots” it is not the 1776 Declaration of Independence but the 1775 “shot heard round the world” at Lexington and Concord that is celebrated as the start of the resistance to British tyranny. While the rhetoric of 1776 justifies—except when it doesn’t– it is the bloodshed of 1775 that inspires these “patriots.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And his historical ignorance notwithstanding, nobody understands this better than the disgraced former president himself.  Back in late April 2019, then-President Trump delivered a rousing address at a National Rifle Association meeting in Indianapolis that centered on just this. And there can be no doubt that he knew he had a captivated audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Denouncing the Mueller probe as a “coup” he incited his supporters to rally to his cause and to oppose “Far-left radicals in Congress [who] want to take away your voice, your jobs, your rights, and they especially want to take away your guns  . . .  you have socialists and far-left Democrats that want to destroy everything that we’ve done.” I</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Invoking the memory of the Minutemen who fought the British at the start of the American Revolution, his message was clear–his supporters must be prepared to “defend” their liberties with their guns:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Two months before the American Revolution broke out, with the shot heard around the world, a group of patriots gathered along a bridge in Salem, Massachusetts. In the preceding months, British soldiers had confiscated muskets in Boston. You know the story well.  Gunpowder was seized in Somerville. And the patriots in Salem knew that the Redcoats would soon come for the town’s cannons. But the Americans were prepared — they already loved our country — and they were determined to defend their rights to the death.  When hundreds of British soldiers arrived at the bridge, the Americans stood firm, blocking their path. When swords were drawn, they didn’t flinch. . .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the courageous actions of those early Americans, we see the defiant and determined spirit of patriotism that has always willed America to its greatest victories.  It is a spirit that is passed down from generation to generation, from fathers and mothers to sons and daughters.  It is the spirit that lives in each and every one of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our duty, our responsibility, our sacred charge, is to preserve the freedoms that our ancestors gave their very lives to secure. Because no matter how many centuries go by, no matter how much the world changes, the central drama of human history remains the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one side are those who seek power, control, and domination. And on the other side are patriots like those in this hall who stand upright and plant their feet in eternal defense of our liberty.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In August of 2020 Kyle Rittenhouse heeded the call. On January 6, 2021, thousands of Three Per Centers, Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, and assorted MAGA devotees heeded the call. Yesterday Ricky Shiffer heeded the call. And they are merely the tip of the spear of a mass movement of MAGA adherents and Trumpist Republican base voters moved by resentment, paranoia, and hatred of liberal democracy itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How many more will heed this call in the days and weeks to come, as far-right Congressional leaders, activists, and media influencers intensify their rhetoric of “patriotic” resistance to “tyranny?” </p>",

        "title": "Republican Staffers Disappointed That Trump Wouldn’t Call off His Mob Were Deluded￼",
        "link": "https://jeffreycisaacdesign.wordpress.com/2022/07/27/republican-staffers-disappointed-that-trump-wouldnt-call-off-his-mob-were-deluded%ef%bf%bc/",
        "description": "<p>July 27, 2022</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The overarching narrative presented by the House January 6 Committee is that the violence of January 6 was the culmination of a long process: that Trump laid the groundwork to undermine the election long before November 2020; promoted the Big Lie every day since the election; invited the mob to the Ellipse on January 6; incited them on that day; urged them to march on the Capitol; and then stood by approvingly while they did what he told them to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, last Thursday’s hearing deliberately focused on Trump’s malfeasance during the three hours in which the insurrection itself took place and Trump watched it unfold while refusing to do anything to restore law and order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the Republicans who testified at the hearing, either live or on video, placed special emphasis on the outrageousness of Trump’s refusal to publicly call off his mob while it ransacked the Capitol and sought to lynch Mike Pence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump’s actions and inactions that afternoon were despicable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But insufficient attention has been paid to the fact that it could hardly have been surprising that Trump would refuse to call off his mob, because it was his mob. And it was doing exactly what he expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insufficient attention has also been paid to the fact that much of the framing of this outrage has too-narrowly centered on Trump’s betrayal of his own Vice President, Mike Pence—who was hardly the only figure in fear for their life on January 6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump’s behavior that day was genuinely outrageous and malign; even if he had wanted there to be a disruption of the Congressional vote counting, his failure to take action as police were being beaten and lives were being threatened was shocking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, anyone who was surprised by Trump’s promotion of violence and his refusal to stop it was not paying attention for years. And the fact that so many of Trump’s so-called “team normal” supported his reelection and continued to work for him even after he refused to concede the election speaks to their own complicity in the events of that day, whether it was due to sheer irresponsibility or malign political intentions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Trump’s entire political persona has centered on violent posturing and on incitements to violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his first run for the White House he regularly called for violence, prompting Politico to run a piece, back in August 2106, on “Trump’s long dalliance with violent rhetoric.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As President, Trump regularly called for violence. When back in September 2020 John Cassidy noted in the New Yorker noted that “Donald Trump’s Incitements to Violence Have Crossed an Alarming Threshold,” he was simply saying what pundits had been saying every other week of the Trump Presidency. For Trump had in fact crossed that threshold before even taking office. A May 2022 piece at Axios documented the many “times Trump has advocated for violence” while in office. An even more “comprehensive timeline” by Vox listed the dozens of times that Trump incited violence, against journalists, political opponents, and even protesters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Was there something particularly troubling about his promotion of violence on January 6? Of course. For that violence was part of an organized attempt to overthrow an election, and it threatened the lives of high U.S. government officials and injured many law enforcement officers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let us not forget that this was not the first time that Trump and his MAGA enthusiasts incited violence against U.S. officials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2016 Trump notoriously threatened “second amendment solutions” against Hillary Clinton, and while in office he regularly invoked this rhetoric. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in late April 2019, he delivered a rousing address at a National Rifle Association meeting in Indianapolis. Denouncing the Mueller probe as a “coup” he incited his supporters to rally to his cause and to oppose “Far-left radicals in Congress [who] want to take away your voice, your jobs, your rights, and they especially want to take away your guns.  You know that.  They want to take away your guns.  . . .  you have socialists and far-left Democrats that want to destroy everything that we’ve done.” Invoking the memory of the Minutemen who fought the British at the start of the American Revolution, his message was clear: his supporters must be prepared to “defend” their liberties with their guns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps most dangerously, Trump clearly incited violence against progressive Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her colleagues on “the Squad,” regularly singling them out for vicious opprobrium. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July of 2019 Trump Tweeted a vicious, racist attack against the Squad, suggesting that they “go back” to the “crime-infested places from which they came.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Days later, in response to critics, Trump followed up on Twitter by again denouncing the Squad and demanding that they “apologize” to the American people, declaring: “We will never be a Socialist or Communist Country. IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY HERE, YOU CAN LEAVE! It is your choice, and your choice alone. This is about love for America. Certain people HATE our Country.” Trump closed by accusing them of being supporters of al Qaeda and apologists for 9-11. It is hard to imagine a more incendiary accusation, entirely contrived and designed to mobilize his angry mob.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At rallies in 2019 and 2020 Trump regularly denounced the “radical left” as “enemies from within” while his crowds denounced Ilhan Omar, chanting  “send her back” and chanting “AOC sucks.” It was indeed widely reported that Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, and Rashida Tlaib had regularly been the target of death threats, and had been forced to take special security measures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet with a few exceptions—most notably Liz Cheney—top Republicans refused to denounce these threats against members of Congress or the consistently inflammatory rhetoric employed by then-President Trump that generated these threats. And so the rhetoric continued, and with it the danger of violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in February 2020, many months before the November election, Trump-appointed FBI Director Christopher Wray, a Republican, testified before Congress that 2019 was the “deadliest” year ever for domestic terrorist attacks and hate crimes in the U.S., singling out white supremacist and far-right militia groups as “the top threat”—the same groups that Trump regularly cultivated. His testimony received major media attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every Republican who supported Trump’s re-election bid in 2020 knew about Trump’s violent rhetoric and these violent threats, and clearly had no problem with them—for they supported the man responsible for them as he crossed the country pouring gasoline on the flames of resentment. Every White House staffer who has so far testified before the January 6 Committee knew this—and yet chose to remain in the White House.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much has recently been made of the fact that Marc Short, then-Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, has voluntarily testified before the House Committee and before a federal grand jury about January 6, apparently attesting to Trump White House lies and to the danger of “a massacre” on January 6 had Pence actually been found by the rioters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pence’s staff are often presented in the media as important parts of “team normal.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet back in July 2019, when Trump denounced the Squad as haters of America, singling out Ilhan Omar with particular hostility, it was none other than Marc Short who defended Trump, suggesting that his comments were legitimate criticisms of her anti-Americanism, and insisting that Trump could not be racist because Elaine Cho, AKA/Mrs. Mitch McConnell, was his Secretary of Transportation. And when House Democrats defended Omar against Trump’s attacks, it was Short—described by Roll Call in 2019 as “Trump’s top Congressional envoy and a leading public defender,” who observed that “if the Democrats choose to want to unite around Omar, it will be interesting to see how that plays out for them.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roll Call also pointed out that minutes later Trump himself posted a Tweet that “echoed” Short: “If Democrats want to unite around the foul language &amp; racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular &amp; unrepresentative Congresswomen, it will be interesting to see how it plays out.” Back then there was no distance between Short and Trump. Back on election day in November 2020 there was no distance. And on January 6 Short was with Trump in the White House.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many Trump White House staffers were horrified when Trump and his minions turned on Mike Pence on January 6, it would appear that they had no problem with the endangerment of Ilhan Omar and her fellow Squad members, or with the way that Trump had spent years inflaming his violent base against his critics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This should not be forgotten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, there was a synergy between Pence and Trump that persisted up until the afternoon of January 6; that has continued as Pence has refused to publicly condemn Trump; and that apparently continues to this day. This past Tuesday both Trump and Pence spoke, at different times, before the far-right Young America’s Foundation. The Times described the speeches as “competing” and as signifying an “uncomfortable split” within the Republican party, and Politico declared “It’s Trump vs. Pence in Washington.” But the most glaring feature of Pence’s speech is that it refused to condemn Trump or to say anything at all about January 6 or about the damning revelations of the House January 6 committee. Pence did insist, in a veiled reference to Trump, that “some people might choose to focus on the past . . . [but] conservatives must focus on the future to win back America.” But speaking of Trump, he also declared that “I don’t know that the President and I differ on issues, but we may differ on focus.” And, downplaying the idea that there is a major ideological split within the Republican party, he noted that he “couldn’t be more proud of the record of the Trump-Pence administration.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a major split promising something new within the Republican party? Hardly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a difference between Marc Short and Mark Meadows, just as there is a difference between Mike Pence and Donald Trump. But the difference exists at the margins. Pence did refuse complicity in Trump’s attempted coup. But he has refused to call that coup what it was, or to testify in Trump’s second impeachment, or to reckon in any way with the forces within his party that promoted it and might promote it again. Indeed, he appeals to these very same forces. Pence may no longer be hand in hand with Trump. But he remains firmly in the Trump orbit, and his ideological hatred of liberalism and of liberal democracy matches that of Trump. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pence will not use profanity. He will not incite crowds to violence—or, given his boring demeanor, to anything else. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But until January 6, Pence proved himself perfectly content to stand by, and stand down, as Trump unleashed his assault on constitutional democracy from the White House. And every member of so-called “team normal” in the White House who stood with Pence on January 6 did the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of them had any business being surprised by Trump’s incitements to violence on that day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And none of them have any business presenting themselves now as heroes of democracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of them have finally decided to come clean about what actually took place in the final days of the Trump White House. Their compliance with the law is admirable, and in some cases, like that of Cassidy Hutchinson, it is even brave. But they are no heroes of democracy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We must never forget how far these people were willing to go in support of autocracy, even if they stopped short of violent insurrection at the last minute, as some of their own were placed in mortal danger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we must do what we can to see that they and their Republican party get what is coming to them—political defeat and historical ignominy.</p>",

        "title": "Two Cheers for Liz Cheney: The “Never Trump” Republican Narrative Is Effective But Also Limiting",
        "link": "https://jeffreycisaacdesign.wordpress.com/2022/07/25/two-cheers-for-liz-cheney-the-never-trump-republican-narrative-is-effective-but-also-limiting/",
        "description": "<p>July 25, 2022 </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last Thursday night’s hearing of the House January 6 Committee was a blockbuster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Committee commenced its hearings back in June, Committee Vice-Chair Liz Cheney carefully outlined the seven core claims the committee would advance, culminating in the claim that then-President Donald Trump stood down and stood by for hours as the insurrection unfolded on his television screen. She promised that the committee would demonstrate that Trump refused to call off the mob that he had invited and incited; to offer any assistance to all of those, including his own Vice President, who were hiding in fear of their lives; and to order the National Guard or anyone else to protect the Capitol and restore order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thursday night’s hearing made good on Cheney’s promise. And due to the unfortunate Covid infection of Committee Chair Bennie Thomas, who was unable to be physically present, Cheney herself was able to shine as the effective leader of the entire hearing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cheney was brilliant, and her performance fully deserves two full-throated cheers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First cheer: Cheney did an excellent job of keeping the entire proceeding on track, and of supporting the night’s two “lead” colleagues, Democrat Elaine Luria and Republican Adam Kinzinger, who carefully made the case for Trump’s contemptible complicity and dereliction of duty on January 6. The testimony of the two live witnesses—along with the use of taped witness testimony, video footage of the insurrection, Trump’s Tweets, and tapes of Trump’s lame speech at 4:17 pm that day– combined to make an utterly compelling case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second cheer: Cheney capped off the entire proceeding with an absolutely terrific speech in which she delivered a powerful indictment of Trump and of MAGA Republicanism more generally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began by thanking the witnesses, especially the female witnesses, who testified knowing they would be attacked and threatened “by President Trump, and by the 50, 60 and 70 year old men who hide themselves behind Executive Privilege.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She then seamlessly pivoted to the non-partisan character of the Committee and its commitment to the truth:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This Committee has shown you the testimony of dozens of Republican witnesses, those who served President Trump loyally for years. The case against Donald Trump in these hearings is not made by witnesses who were his political enemies. It is, instead, a series of confessions by Donald Trump’s own appointees, his own friends, his own campaign officials, people who worked for him for years, and his own family. They have come forward and they have told the American people the truth. And for those of you who seem to think the evidence would be different if Republican Leader McCarthy had not withdrawn his nominees from this Committee, let me ask you this: Do you really think Bill Barr is such a delicate flower that he would wilt under cross examination? Pat Cipillone? Eric Herschman? Jeff Rosen? Richard Donoghue? Of course they aren’t – none of our witnesses are.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She then went on to emphasize that Trump continues to pose a danger because he continues to hold many millions of citizens in thrall to his lies:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Here is the worst part. Donald Trump knows that millions of Americans who supported him would stand up and defend our nation were it threatened. They would put their lives and their freedom at stake to protect her. And he is preying on their patriotism. He is preying on their sense of justice. And on January 6th, Donald Trump turned their love of country into a weapon against our Capitol and our Constitution. He has purposely created the false impression that America is threatened by a foreign force controlling voting machines, or that a wave of tens of millions of false ballots were secretly injected into our election system, or that ballot workers have secret thumb drives and are stealing elections with them. All complete nonsense. We must remember that we cannot abandon the truth and remain a free nation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And she concluded by underscoring the categorical imperative to keep Trump away from political power, invoking nothing less than the patron saints of conservative Republicanism, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, to make her point:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And every American must consider this. Can a President who is willing to make the choices Donald Trump made during the violence of January 6th ever be trusted with any position of authority in our great nation again?  . . . Ronald Reagan’s great ally, Margaret Thatcher, said this: “Let it never be said that the dedication of those who love freedom is less than the determination of those who would destroy it.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cheney’s message was powerful and her delivery equally powerful, and she did her very best to appeal to any Republicans or independents who might possibly be persuaded that Trump and his MAGA following represent threats to the republic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the proverbial “court of public opinion,” Cheney’s performance represented a very important contribution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is why it deserves two full-throated cheers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But only two. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the very strength of Cheney’s rhetorical framing was also a weakness: by emphasizing the importance of Republican “truth-tellers,” and evoking Republican symbols, Cheney, along with Kinzinger—who mentioned only in passing that 147 of his Republican colleagues voted to decertify Biden’s election on January 6 after the insurrection—Cheney almost sounded like she was trying to treat Trump as an outlier, and to exonerate the Republican party itself, the brand if not the current leadership. And, of course, it would be foolish to expect anything else from her. Because she is a conservative Republican, and she is seeking reelection as a conservative Republican. And, perhaps most importantly, her break with Trump and with the party leadership that supports him really became irreparable only after January 6, because for her it was not the Mueller report or the first impeachment but only Trump’s refusal to accept his electoral loss that represented a bridge too far. It would be absurd to expect her to deliver a direct attack on the party with which she still associates. And equally absurd to “fault” her for being who she is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She clearly is a Republican, but a dissenting Republican who takes seriously the Constitution, and she is currently persona non grata within her party, who will almost certainly lose to a MAGA opponent in the Wyoming primary. Her message, and her very leadership on the committee, does speak strongly against the current direction of the party. But however understandably, it does not speak strongly enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is important, because it is not simply Trump, and not simply his most fanatical Republican supporters, who represent a threat to democracy. The entire Republican party, up and down the ballot, with perhaps a handful of exceptions, is now a threat to democracy. And the party as a whole must defeated in November and in 2024 if liberal democracy is to be preserved. And to the extent that too much emphasis is placed on the worst of the worst—Trump and his geriatric claimants of “executive privilege”– the much wider circle of very bad threatens to come off looking pretty good, if only by comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this respect last Thursday’s hearing came up short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us recall Cheney’s strong opening frame: “The case against Donald Trump in these hearings is not made by witnesses who were his political enemies. It is, instead, a series of confessions by Donald Trump’s own appointees, his own friends, his own campaign officials, people who worked for him for years, and his own family.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cheney described these Republicans as truth-tellers. But these people were only partial truth-tellers, and only at the very last minute, some only after receiving subpoenas to testify. And while they told truths about January 6, and in some cases about the weeks leading up to it, they did not tell truths about Trump’s entire presidency, about his incitement to violence against his enemies long before January 6, and indeed they did not tell the truth about why they campaigned for him in 2020 or remained with him weeks into his effort to overthrow the November 2020 election results, and only broke with him in late December or on January 6 itself. For Trump’s violent rhetoric and hostility to liberal democracy have been well known for years. And these things inhibited none of the Republican witnesses from not simply supporting but working for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The witnesses deserve to be appreciated for being honest and coming forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But “truth teller” is much too generous a way to describe any of them, including Cassidy Hutchinson, who actually attended Trump’s ellipse speech on the morning of January 6 apparently hoping for something she might consider acceptable, and who willingly worked with Mark Meadows literally up until the insurrection began.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it is simply false to describe their testimony as “confession.” The Republican witnesses spoke honestly about the evil they witnessed. But none of them offered any kind of “confession” or “mea culpa” for their part in supporting Trump, for working for him to win a second term in office, and for staying with him long after he began his effort to overturn the election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, Cheney’s understandable rhetorical choice to center on the contrast these Republicans and Trump’s “political enemies” is also problematic. For it leaves no space for other critics, and implies that non-Republican critics were simply partisan enemies rather than principled defenders of liberal democracy—and I say “implies” deliberately, because I do not believe that Cheney said or intended to say precisely this. But the words she chose were, perhaps unconsciously, unfortunate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine if, instead, Cheney had said this: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The case against Donald Trump in these hearings is not made by witnesses who were his political opponents but by Donald Trump’s own appointees, his own friends, his own campaign officials, people who worked for him for years, and his own family, many of who supported him through the November election and even in his efforts to litigate it in the courts, but who could not support an insurrection. This highlights the non-partisan nature of our committee’s work, in pursuing the best witnesses and in treating them fairly. Not only Donald Trump, but also House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, have denounced the committee’s work as partisan and have denounced my liberal Democratic colleagues on the committee as enemies. But they are wrong to do this. And this committee demonstrates that it is possible for responsible politicians to reach across the aisle to do the work of democracy. I only wish Rep. Kinzinger and I were not the only Republican colleagues to do the right thing here.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that these words might actually have better captured what Cheney and Kinzinger have in fact been doing these past months. But they also would have represented a more fundamental critique of—and thus break with– their party than either of them are clearly willing to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cheney and Kinzinger have nonetheless played a brave and important role in the committee’s work and in the defense of liberal democracy, and they fully deserve their two hearty cheers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not a third. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For that would require something more: a full-throated and unequivocal denunciation of the current Republican party and an equally unequivocal call for all Republicans who value the Constitution to break with their party and to work for the defeat of every single Republican politician who has refused to call January 6 what it was—an attempted coup by a dictatorial president who still leads the Republican party and still commands the support of its leaders and its base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump is the Republican party, and the Republican party is Trump. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And both must be defeated.</p>",

        "title": "Indiana University Must Defend Dr. Caitlin Bernard",
        "link": "https://jeffreycisaacdesign.wordpress.com/2022/07/20/indiana-university-must-defend-dr-caitlin-bernard/",
        "description": "<p>July 20, 2022</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indiana and Indiana University are in the news, thanks to the courage and professionalism of Dr. Caitlin Bernard and the outrageous behavior of right-wing Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the news broke last week that Dr. Bernard had lawfully and professionally performed an abortion on a 10 year-old rape victim from Ohio, the right-wing media ecosphere immediately weaponized the story, first denouncing it as “fake news” promoted by baby-killing liberals, and then denouncing it as true story about baby-killing liberals. In response, Rokita decided that the entire incident warranted an official investigation—of Dr. Caitlin Bernard! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking to the airwaves at Fox News, Rokita described Dr. Bernard as “an abortion activist acting as a doctor,” and declared: “we’re gathering information, we’re gathering the evidence as we speak, and we are going to fight this till the end, including looking at her licensure, if she failed to report, and in Indiana it’s a crime to not report . . . “  Having insinuated that Dr. Bernard’s conduct was criminal, Rokita went on to explain why he was so outraged: “There’s a strong public interest in understanding of someone under the age of 16 or under the age of 18 or really any woman is having an abortion in our state.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read those words over again. He is speaking about more than the filing of medical reports. He is declaring, ominously, that his job as the state’s chief law enforcement officer is to monitor every abortion in the state as if it is a threat to law and order itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not content to announce his solidarity with Ohio’s draconian abortion law, Rokita ended by laying his far-right political cards clearly on the table: “This is a horrible, horrible scene caused by Marxists and socialists and those in the White House who want lawlessness at the border and this girl was politicized—politicized—for the gain of killing more babies.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Caitlin Bernard is a physician affiliated with IU Health. As importantly, she is an Assistant Professor of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Indiana University School of Medicine. She has an extensive CV, indicating that she is a dedicated teacher, a very active scholar, and the recipient of numerous awards. She is, in short, a distinguished member of the IU community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The attacks on her are barbaric, and people who care about medicine, public health, academic freedom or civil rights have rallied to her defense. According to the IndyStar, since last Friday colleagues across the country have started two GoFundMe accounts that together have raised over $100,000 to cover her legal expenses. According to The Star, the description of the fundraising effort reads:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are Ob/Gyn providers &amp; abortion providers from across the country who want to thank our colleague, Dr. Caitlin Bernard, for doing a courageous thing and helping provide compassionate healthcare to a child in her time of need. Many of us have experienced this in our line of work, and the ability to rise to the call despite tragedy like this is truly commendable.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet the higher administration of Indiana University has said nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responding to Rokita’s charge that Dr. Bernard had broken the law, IU Health did release a terse statement that managed to legalistically set the record straight while saying nothing about the real controversy:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As part of IU Health’s commitment to patient privacy and compliance with privacy laws, IU Health routinely initiates reviews, including the matters in the news concerning Dr. Caitlin Bernard. IU Health conducted an investigation with the full cooperation of Dr. Bernard and other IU Health team members. IU Health’s investigation found Dr.  Bernard in compliance with privacy laws.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But nothing has been said by IU leaders to defend Dr. Bernard from the scurrilous and dangerous attacks she has received or to articulate the values of academic freedom and health care professionalism under threat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Pamela Whitten has by all accounts said nothing about this. The latest post at her blog, Written by Whitten, dated July 12, is “Pell grants have increased opportunities for students for 50 years.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The “News at IU” website featuring all IU Press releases contains no press release about this national news, which raises major questions of morality, professional ethics, and academic freedom—issues now widely discussed in the national media–but apparently is not worthy of local comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official IU website of Dr. Jay L. Hess, the Dean of the Indiana University School of Medicine, lists a number of statements, but contains nothing about the attacks on Dr. Bernard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One person has spoken out with special clarity about the attacks: Dr. Tracey Wilkinson, an Assistant Professor at the IU School of Medicine, who has published a powerful and brave guest column in the New York Times, starkly entitled “Dr. Caitlyn Bernard Was Meant to Write This With Me Before She Was Attacked for Doing Her Job.” Dr. Wilkinson’s piece expresses solidarity with Dr. Bernard; clearly explains the chilling effect of Attorney General Rokita’s accusations and investigation on all health care professionals who deliver obstetric, gynecological, and pediatric care; and denounces the threats against her colleague and against her profession. The piece is a loud clarion call, and it contrasts starkly with the public silence of the administrators who run Indiana University. That it is written by an Assistant Professor is particularly telling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To his credit, Dr. Aaron Carroll, the Chief Health Officer of Indiana University who writes regularly for the Times about health issues, has posted many strong statements in support of Dr. Bernard and of Dr. Wilkinson’s piece on his Twitter feed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as far as I can discern, the top leadership of Indiana University has said nothing about the fact that an IU faculty member who is also a professional affiliate of IU Health is being not simply denounced in the right-wing press, but targeted by the state’s most powerful legal official as a “baby killer” deserving of criminal investigation–and Rokita’s demonizing language also implies that Dr. Bernard is deserving of public anger, thus placing her and her family in physical jeopardy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This silence from IU so-called “leaders” is an outrage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Whitten and Dean Hess ought to be ashamed of themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indiana University is a public university, not an extension of the state’s Republican administration or the Attorney General’s far-right anti-abortion agenda. If it stands for anything, it is the freedom of its faculty and professional staff to do their jobs without being threatened or investigated for doing so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every leader affiliated with Indiana University ought to speak up in defense of Dr. Bernard or resign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And every faculty body ought to speak clearly against the vindictive investigation announced by Attorney General Rokita, and in defense of the academic freedom and simple physical safety of Dr. Bernard and her family and friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do anything less is a disgrace to academic values, civil liberty, and simple human decency.</p>",

        "description": "<p>July 17, 2022</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade on June 24, the Republican party has doubled down on its utter contempt for women’s rights and civil rights more generally. The party leadership’s hostility is blatant, and it would be nice to imagine that it would motivate “independent” and even some Republican voters to see the danger the party poses to democracy, and to vote Democratic in November. Whether this will happen is an open question. But the enmity of leading Republicans to even elemental forms of decency and common sense is clearly not in doubt. As Adam Serwer noted back in 2018, for these people and many of their follows “the cruelty is the point.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recent grandstanding of Ken Paxton, the far-right Republican Attorney General of the state of Texas, is a case in point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services of the Department of Health and Human Services published a new Guideline entitled “Reinforcement of EMTALA Obligations specific to patients who are Pregnant or are Experiencing Pregnancy Loss.” The Guideline centered on a simple reminder: “The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) provides rights to any individual who comes to a hospital emergency department and requests examination or treatment.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Act in question, passed by Congress in 1986 and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, was designed “to ensure public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay.” It established that any hospital in the U.S. that receives any funding or reimbursement from Medicare or Medicaid must provide medical care to anyone seeking emergency treatment, and cannot turn away anyone experiencing an emergency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Guideline is perhaps the most important move taken by the Biden administration to use executive power to limit the damage to abortion rights caused by the Supreme Court’s June 24 Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. Its purpose is rather straightforward: to invoke an existing federal law in order to prevent hospitals in states banning abortions from refusing to treat women who will die unless their pregnancies are medically terminated. And the purpose of the law itself was also fairly straightforward: to prevent hospitals from refusing to treat patients in danger of dying without treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty basic, Hippocratic Oath type stuff, you might think. Perhaps in another time and place. But not now in the great state of Texas.  And so Paxton has filed a federal lawsuit challenging the guidance on the grounds that it requires and indeed compels hospitals and doctors “to perform abortions” in violation of state law. Behind constitutional niceties, the Texas suit boils down to this claim: the federal government might seek to exercise its executive power to enforce the right of individual women to receive emergency medical attention, but this mandate should not override the state of Texas’s insistence that if the protection of a fetus is involved, hospitals and doctors must let these women die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this in the name of “right to life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are surely some contentious constitutional questions related to federalism in play here, and we can be sure they will be extensively and relentlessly litigated by Republicans seeking injunctions wherever they can obtain them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, Paxton is not acting alone; he is simply the most emphatic of Republican Attorneys General in the dozens of red states currently in the process of enacting draconian restrictions on reproductive freedom, and he is stating very plainly the “logic,” as it were, behind these restrictions: that pregnant women whose lives are in danger might seek medical help to save their lives, but the needs and the claims of these women seeking life-saving abortions must be repudiated by the state in the name of the fetuses that these women are carrying in their bellies. And women seeking to get around this restriction, and the health care professionals who treat them, ought to be treated as criminals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ”logic” of Paxton’s position is surely extreme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the extreme to which the far-right Republican party is willing to go to enforce its patriarchal moralism is emblematic of the party’s hostility toward civil rights in general and toward the civil rights of women in particular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paxton’s Texas Republican party stands for not simply the right, but the state-imposed duty of hospitals and doctors to let women at risk die whenever giving them care jeopardizes the fetuses lodged in their uteruses. And while some Republicans elsewhere are willing to incorporate “exceptions” for the life of the mother, even these exceptions are so tenuous and vaguely worded as to render virtually all medical treatment for high-risk pregnancies liable to criminal prosecution—and thus to create a climate of suspicion and fear for all pregnant women and the health professionals who serve them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When in doubt, if not always, let at-risk pregnant women die rather than threaten the fetuses in their bellies” would seem to be the perverse dictum that Paxton and many of his fellow Republican Attorneys General seek to defend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Indiana, Republican cruelty has taken a different form, in some ways less severe, but in other ways more. Here it is not a matter of the lives of pregnant women that is at stake, but the ability of child rape victims to end their criminally-inflicted pregnancies. A few weeks back the Indianapolis Star ran a story about how “Patients head to Indiana for abortion services as other states restrict care.” Among other things, the story quoted Dr. Caitlin Bernard, an Indianapolis obstetrician-gynecologist who had just performed an abortion on a 10-year old rape victim from Ohio whose local OB-GYN could no longer perform the procedure due to the state’s restrictive “fetal heartbeat” law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will confess that I was as shocked as anyone to learn that the very red state of Indiana in which I live was actually a kind of sanctuary for young women rape victims wanting to end pregnancies forced on them by rapists. Apparently so too did Indiana’s far-right Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita.  Propelled into action by the right-wing media ecosphere–which immediately weaponized the story, denouncing it as “fake news” promoted by baby-killing liberals—Rokita decided that the entire incident warranted an investigation—of Dr. Caitlin Bernard! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking to the airwaves at Fox News, Rokita described Dr. Bernard as “an abortion activist acting as a doctor,” and declared: “we’re gathering information, we’re gathering the evidence as we speak, and we are going to fight this till the end, including looking at her licensure, if she failed to report, and in Indiana it’s a crime to not report . . . “  Having insinuated that Dr. Bernard’s conduct was criminal—in fact she acted entirely according to the law, as she always has done–Rokita went on to explain why he was so determined to investigate: “There’s a strong public interest in understanding if someone under the age of 16 or under the age of 18 or really any woman is having an abortion in our state.” Read those words again. He is clearly speaking about more than a bureaucratic matter of medical record keeping. He is declaring, ominously, that his job as the state’s chief law enforcement officer is to monitor every abortion in the state as if it is a threat to law and order itself (can you imagine him declaring “there is a strong public interest in understanding if someone under the age of 16 or 18 or really any woman was having a root canal?”)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not content to announce his solidarity with Ohio’s draconian abortion law, Rokita ended with a proud paean to Trumpism in general: “This is a horrible, horrible scene caused by Marxists and socialists and those in the White House who want lawlessness at the border and this girl was politicized—politicized—for the gain of killing more babies.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the level to which the Republican party has sunk: the insistence that dying women and child rape victims must be forced to carry pregnancies to term, and that health care professionals like Dr. Bernard who seek to serve patients in need are insidious baby-killers and Enemies of the People in league with Marxists, socialists, and . . . Democrats! If only Todd Rokita were an outlier. But he is not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Public opinion polls have long indicated that clear majorities support Roe v. Wade, and much stronger majorities support a right to an abortion in cases of rape, incest, and risk to the life of the mother. The extremism, the vindictiveness, and the sheer cruelty currently being performed and promoted by Paxton, Rokita, and other important Republic leaders, especially at the state level, would seem far beyond the pale of “mainstream” public opinion. It might even complicate the campaigns of some Republicans running in swing districts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it remains a bedrock commitment of the Republican party leaders and much of the party’s base. And, thanks to the Dobbs decision of the conservative supermajority that this party assiduously elevated to the Supreme Court, this commitment is now the law of the land. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turning this around will be a huge political challenge. And even in the unlikely event it precipitates a truly massive mobilization of voters in November, things are going to get a lot worse for a lot more women before they start getting better—if they ever do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How many rape victims must be forced to carry pregnancies to term, how many women with at-risk pregnancies will have to die, how many doctors, nurses, and vulnerable women will have to endure harassment and vindictive prosecution, before the American public wakes up to the egregious injustice that has just begun to unfold? Can elemental human decency, much less civic equality, stand a chance against the resentment and cruelty that the Republican party so effectively mobilizes? Will Republicans pay any electoral price at all this November for the barbaric policy for which they are responsible? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We shall see.</p>",

        "link": "https://jeffreycisaacdesign.wordpress.com/2022/07/04/%ef%bf%bcsusan-b-anthony-is-rolling-over-in-her-grave-this-july-4th/",
        "description": "<p>July 4, 2022</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little over a week ago, the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision decisively overturned over 50 years of precent established by Roe v. Wade, thereby delivering a death blow to the reproductive freedom of women across the country, from sea to shining sea. That this represents an assault on women’s rights, and on democratic citizenship itself, is widely understood by many Americans. At the same time, for the minority of Americans who have energetically sought this result for decades, the decision, perversely, represents not a defeat but a triumph of not simply “life” but “women” and “democracy” itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among these indefatigable activists one Marjorie Dannenfelser looms large, as the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, formerly known as the Susan B. Anthony List. Founded in 1993 and rebranded this year, the group relentlessly opposes abortion while claiming to promote the activism of women committed to “traditional,” i.e., patriarchal, “family values.” Last week’s SCOTUS decision was a major victory for the group, which has feted such feminists as Joni Ernst, Nikki Haley, Mike Pence, and Donald Trump. And on the very day the decision was rendered, Dannenfelser announced that her group would now undertake a campaign to ban abortion “in every state and in every legislature, including the Congress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claiming the banner of Susan B. Anthony, one of the most important feminists and women’s suffrage activists in U.S. history, Dannenfelser indeed declared that the decision is “a restoration of what authentic feminism is.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Susan B. Anthony heard these words, then she is no doubt rolling over in her grave. And on this July 4, as we face a multi-pronged effort by the Republican party to undermine democracy itself, it is especially appropriate to consider why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One reason is straightforward: because, while “pro-life activists” have laid claim to her legacy, it has long been well understood that this claim is highly controversial and equally problematic, centering as it does on the almost certainly false attribution to Anthony of a single article, anonymously published in 1869, entitled “Marriage and Maternity” that itself emphatically denounced laws banning abortion even as it valorized maternity and described abortion as “child murder.” (Harper D. Ward has published a careful and devastating critique of the claims of Dannenfelser and other anti-abortion activists entitled “Misrepresenting Susan B. Anthony on Abortion” at the website of the National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second reason is equally straightforward but more profound: because last week’s SCOTUS decision represents an assault not only abortion rights but on the broader commitment to egalitarian democracy that was at the heart of Anthony’s career as a women’s rights activist and suffragette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For according to the logic of the decision, it is entirely legitimate for states to outlaw abortion—and, by implication, contraception, non-heteronormative sex, non-heterosexual and perhaps even interracial marriage. And it is equally legitimate to treat women seeking abortion and the doctors who furnish them with reproductive health care—along with a wide range of other categories of people seeking to enjoy privacy in their intimate lives or to pursue their professional vocations without interference–as criminals. The idea that this is remotely consistent with equal citizenship is preposterous. In the 21st century–which is not the 18th century–to abolish a general “right to privacy” is to relegate entire categories of people to the status of second-class citizens who live under a potential or an actual cloud of suspicion, are denied the freedom to be the people that they are, and are at risk of criminal prosecution if they behave as the people that they are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing could be further from the egalitarian vision of Anthony and her 19th century colleagues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was on another July 4, in 1876, that the uninvited Anthony seized the platform of the Centennial celebration of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia, and declared that “we ask justice, we ask equality, we ask that all the civil and political rights that belong to citizens of the United States, be guaranteed to us and our daughters forever.” She proceeded to read aloud and then circulate a text drafted by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Matilda Joslyn Gage, and herself for the National Woman Suffrage Association entitled “Declaration of the Rights of Woman of the United States.” This Declaration, much like its more famous predecessor, the 1848 Seneca Falls “Declaration of Sentiments,” offered a feminist and radically egalitarian revision of the original 1776 Declaration of Independence, well summed up in this paragraph: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our faith is firm and unwavering in the broad principles of human rights proclaimed in 1776, not only as abstract truths, but as the corner stones of a republic. Yet we cannot forget, even in this glad hour, that while all men of every race, and clime, and condition, have been invested with the full rights of citizenship under our hospitable flag, all women still suffer the degradation of disfranchisement.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After enumerating a long list of degradations, all linked to the denial of the right to vote, the text concluded thus: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And now, at the close of a hundred years, as the hour-hand of the great clock that marks the centuries points to 1876, we declare our faith in the principles of self-government; our full equality with man in natural rights; that woman was made first for her own happiness, with the absolute right to herself – to all the opportunities and advantages life affords for her complete development; and we deny that dogma of the centuries, incorporated in the codes of all nations – that woman was made for man – her best interests, in all cases, to be sacrificed to his will. We ask of our rulers, at this hour, no special favors, no special privileges, no special legislation. We ask justice, we ask equality, we ask that all the civil and political rights that belong to citizens of the United States, be guaranteed to us and our daughters forever.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is impossible to reconcile these words with the mission statement and the advocacy of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Anthony most famous speech, “Is it a Crime for a Citizen of the United States to Vote?” undermines not simply the right-wing “pro-life” position on abortion but the entire jurisprudence underlying the SCOTUS majority decision overturning Roe. For it challenges the very idea that fundamental rights require explicit articulation in the Constitution in order to be considered fundamental.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The circumstances surrounding the speech are now legendary. On November 1, 1872, along with a number of other women, Anthony visited a voter registration office in Rochester, New York with the intention of registering to vote. Her goal was to cast a vote for Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for U.S. President, in 1872, on the ticket of the Equality Party. The registration officials refused to allow her to register on the grounds that she was a woman, but when she threatened to sue them, they relented. She thus registered and, on election day on November 5, 1872, she voted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Days later this “transgression” was reported, leading to her arrest for illegally voting in a federal election. Anthony refused to plead guilty or to accept bail, and spent 2 months in jail, hoping to have her case brought to the Supreme Court. She was tried on June 17, 1873, during which the judge precipitously ended the trial by denouncing her and directing the jury to declare a guilty verdict. At her sentencing hearing on June 18, she disregarded the judge’s orders and delivered a speech against her conviction. The judge then declared her penalty to be a $10,000 fine. She refused to pay, and he allowed her to be released anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was in the Spring of 1873, while out on bail awaiting trial, that Anthony organized a speaking tour throughout upstate New York, in which she delivered “Is it a Crime for a Citizen of the United States to Vote?” The speech was quite literally a tour de force. Drawing on a wide range of legal and political sources in the American political tradition—the Declaration, the Revolution, and the “spirit of ‘76”; a litany of state constitutions and legislative enactments; a long tradition of legal scholarship and constitutional argument; and especially the Constitution itself and its recently ratified13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments—Anthony insisted that it is not and should not be regarded as a crime for any citizen of the U.S. to vote, and that women, as citizens, have as much right to vote as any other citizens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear, the National Woman Suffrage Association, founded by Anthony and Stanton, was formed in 1869 in protest of the 15th Amendment’s failure to explicitly repudiate the denial of voting rights to women, and it represented an important split within the long-standing coalition between abolitionists and feminists in support of egalitarian democracy (the broader dynamic of racism within sections of the suffragette movement is nicely discussed here and here). But while initially committed to the amendment of the Constitution to enshrine female suffrage, by the early 1870’s, Anthony had embraced a rhetorical strategy centered on the idea that another Constitutional amendment was hardly necessary to advance the cause of women’s rights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her argument was simple: the Constitution itself already implicitly required a woman’s right to vote, in the language of its preamble; the 13th Amendment’s abolition of “slavery and involuntary servitude”; the 14th Amendment’s commitment to equal protection under the law; and the 15th Amendment’s insistence that the right to vote shall not be denied on the basis of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude. For if any “class” has long experienced servitude, Anthony argued, it was women.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, Anthony argued that even if the Constitution never articulated a woman’s right to vote, a reading of its core provisions was impossible to reconcile with the denial of this right—an argument for “substantive due process” avant la lettre. A pretty straight line can be drawn between the logic of this argument and the “substantive due process” jurisprudence behind Roe and, before it, Griswold, centered on the idea of a generalized “right to privacy.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony would surely be appalled by the Dobbs ruling and by the radical logic behind it, which repudiates a century of normative, legal, and political progress in the understanding and the codification of women’s rights, human rights, and democracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But she might not be surprised. And while she would surely not forswear legal or jurisprudential efforts to reinstate the value of female autonomy assaulted by Dobbs, she would probably reiterate the argument she made in that infamous 1872 speech—that what the situation required was a strategy of political activism to reclaim the existing Constitution and the rights entailed by it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concluding words of that speech are worth quoting verbatim:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Benjamin F. Butler, in a recent letter to me, said:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I do not believe anybody in Congress doubts that the Constitution authorizes the right of women to vote, precisely as if authorizes trial by jury and many other like rights guaranteed to citizens.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, General Butler said:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It is not laws we want; there are plenty of laws-good enough, too. Administrative ability to enforce law is the great want of the age, in this country especially. Everybody talks of law, law. If everybody would insist on the enforcement of law, the government would stand on a firmer basis, and question would settle themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it is upon this just interpretation of the United States Constitution that our National Woman Suffrage Association which celebrates the twenty-fifth anniversary of the woman’s rights movement in New York on the 6th of May next, has based all its arguments and action the past five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We no longer petition Legislature or Congress to give us the right to vote. We appeal to the women everywhere to exercise their too long neglected “citizen’s right to vote.” We appeal to the inspectors of election everywhere to receive the votes of all United States citizens as it is their duty to do. We appeal to United States commissioners and marshals to arrest the inspectors who reject the names and votes of United States citizens, as it is their duty to do, and leave those alone who, like our eighth ward inspectors, perform their duties faithfully and well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We ask the juries to fail to return verdicts of “guilty” against honest, law-abiding, tax-paying United States citizens for offering their votes at our elections. Or against intelligent, worthy young men, inspectors of elections, for receiving and counting such citizens votes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We ask the judges to render true and unprejudiced opinions of the law, and wherever there is room for a doubt to give its benefit on the side of liberty and equal rights to women, remembering that “the true rule of interpretation under our national constitution, especially since its amendments, is that anything for human rights is constitutional, everything against human right unconstitutional.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it is on this line that we propose to fight our battle for the ballot-all peaceably, but nevertheless persistently through to complete triumph, when all United States citizens shall be recognized as equals before the law.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can Americans committed to democracy and the equal rights of all citizens summon the energy and mobilize the resources to renew this fight? Will the Democratic party and its leadership rise to the occasion, recognizing that politics as usual is not now an option, and that it is urgently necessary to mobilize vast numbers of voters in November on the basis of a real commitment to democratic reform, social and economic justice, and the reinstatement of the ideal of civic equality?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will see.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Following POLITICO Pro’s publication of the Commission’s Pharmaceutical Legislation Impact Assessment the future of Europe’s life sciences sector remains in sharp focus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the outset of this Commission, President von der Leyen’s aims — to ensure Europe has the supply of affordable medicines to meet its needs, and to support the European pharmaceutical industry to ensure that it remains an innovator and world leader — gave some hope to an industry in Europe that’s seeing investment leave its shores for Asia and the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question now is do some, or even any, of the options laid out in the Pharmaceutical Legislation Impact Assessment support Europe to achieve those goals?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 1994, the EU’s Communication on the “Outlines of an Industrial Policy for the Pharmaceutical Sector in the European Community”, said that the “pharmaceutical industry is a substantial asset for growth and employment in the European Union” and that“there are signs that the competitiveness of the Community industry is yielding in comparison with its main competitors”.Thirty years later, this prediction has become painfully true. Today, 47 percent of new treatments are of U.S. origin compared to just 25 percent emanating from Europe (2014-2018).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question now is do some, or even any, of the options laid out in the Pharmaceutical Legislation Impact Assessment support Europe to achieve those goals?</p>\n\n\n\nNathalie Moll, director general, EFPIA\n\n\n\n<p>We failed to act then but this Commission, through the revision of the legislation, has a unique and perhaps the last opportunity to retain a pharmaceutical research ecosystem in Europe. There remains a misnomer that the decision in front of the Commission is either to help member countries address the access, availability and affordability of medicines by facilitating the early entry of older generic medicines or to ensure that research, development and access to the latest advances in patient care happens in Europe.  We believe this doesn’t need to be a choice. By using the right policy to address the right issue, we can drive innovation and improve access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coupled with the fact that despite the incredible advances in treatment over the past two decades the cost of medicines as a percentage of health care spend has remined flat at around 15 percent, should leave space for the Commission to create a new legislation that will retain a life-science ecosystem in Europe as well as help address access issues in partnership with industry and member countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the proposal in Option C of the Impact Assessment to link market launch in all 27 member countries to Regulatory Data Protection (RDP) and Market Exclusivity (ME) periods. We share the aim of faster, more equitable access to new medicines across Europe. It’s why we published our companies’ commitment to file for pricing and reimbursement in all EU countries within two years of receiving marketing authorization. But linking this commitment to intellectual property (IP) protections designed to support the research and development of new treatments and vaccines 15 years before they are launched will not facilitate faster access for patients, on the contrary.  It will, however, further erode existing IP provisions protecting medical innovation across the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you support Europe to be at the forefront of the next generation of treatments and vaccines while delivering faster, more equitable access to medicines across Europe?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It means developing a longer term (15-20 year) European strategy, creating stability and confidence to attract biopharmaceutical investment over the 10-15 years it takes to develop a medicine It means rethinking our approach to the research, development and manufacture of advanced therapies, realizing the potential of digitalization, fostering sustainable procurement and pricing policies as well as investing in truly world class hubs for medical innovation. It can only be built on a robust, world leading intellectual property framework and an ambitious evolution of the EU regulatory framework to ensure it is future-proofed against increasing demand on its resources and the rapidly advancing science.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Europe’s political reality is that most of the policy tools that impact on access, availability and affordability of medicines rest with member countries. To make real progress on access requires a shared, evidence-based understanding of root causes of barriers and delays to access and the right competencies around the table. And there are some changes that can be made at a European level.  Modelling by IQVIA predicts that the industry’s commitment to file would increase the availability of medicines from 18 percent up to 64 percent in several countries and critically, reduce the time patients wait for new medicines by four to five months in countries such as Bulgaria (-179 days), Poland (-129 days) and Romania (-155 days). All without linking the commitment on access to IP tools such as regulatory data protection and market exclusivity that are fundamental to R&amp;D investment in the next generation of treatments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fairer system to connect pricing of treatments to EU countries’ ability to pay and the use of new and flexible ways to spread costs overtime or link reimbursement to the results for patients can help both access to, and the sustainability of, health care more broadly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question for European policy makers is not if innovation will happen but where.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why it matters</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With over 8,000 new medicines in development the question for European policy makers is not if innovation will happen but where. And that matters. It matters for patients, for our health care systems and research ecosystem. It matters for our resilience, for jobs and growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to ensure that European patients are not at the back of the queue or relying on diagnostics, treatments and vaccines developed in other parts of the world. We want Europeans to be able to participate in clinical trials run in Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to ensure that our academic, SME and research community continues to benefit from the €42 billion industry invests in R&amp;D across the region. We want the 840,000 employees of the industry in Europe to continue to discover, develop and deliver new medicines right here in the EU, helping our industry to remain the biggest contributor to the EU trade balance of any sector.   As a life-scientist and a passionate European but also as a mum and daughter, I am deeply concerned by the long-term trend of research and development activity moving to other regions and particularly, the impact that will have on European patients. I hope that the revision of the pharmaceutical legislation can be a catalyst for Europe to shake the access vs. innovation dogma and work together to achieve both.</p>",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/pixelbook-cancelled-google-exits-chromebook-arena",
        "description": "<p>Talk about a rollercoaster ride. Just a couple of months ago, Robby stumbled upon – hiding in plain sight – evidence that Google absolutely had plans to make a new Pixelbook. After spending the last two years tirelessly scouring the Chromium repository for signs of a new Made by Google Chromebook, (with little reward) the realization that Rick Osterloh himself flat out confirmed a new device breathed new life into our dreams of a new Pixelbook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the veiled nature of Mr. Osterloh’s statement, that spark was all it took to reignite the flame of hope that Google was working on the first-ever Tensor-powered Pixelbook. We have discussed this at length on numerous podcasts and given Apple’s monumental success in shifting to ARM-powered macOS devices, imagining a next-gen Pixelbook powered by Tensor really wasn’t a bridge too far. In fact, the idea of a new Google Chromebook powered by the company’s in-house SoC is a rumor that has been making rounds in the rumor mill for over a year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some of those “leaks” appear completely unfounded, Rick Osterloh’s aforementioned statement leads me to believe that they weren’t entirely based in fantasy. After all, most rumors are born from a fragment of the truth. Whatever Google had up its sleeve, we were excited because frankly, there’s just something about the Pixlebooks. It’s nearly impossible to put into words but Google’s Chromebooks, even the OG Pixels, were simply “built different.” The newer Pixelbook-branded devices weren’t the most powerful Chromebooks on the market. Nor did they necessarily house any features that you couldn’t find in models from other OEMs. Yet, there is an almost intangible feeling you get when you pick up a Made by Google Chromebook. </p>\n\n\n\nPixelbook vs. PixelBook Go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA tablet in the gap\n\n\n\n<p>Google SVP Rick Osterloh didn’t spill the beans on when we would see a new Pixelbook but he did take the stage at Google I/O to announces some other exciting hardware to soon come out of Mountain View. Along with the Pixel Watch that Rick was sporting on stage, the senior vice president also threw out a curveball that we would see a Tensor-powered Pixel Android tablet in 2023. Okay… Weird turn of events but I’m tracking, Rick. Don’t get me wrong. The thought of seeing a true successor to the Pixel C is exciting. The Android tablet space is absolutely one dimensional with Samsung being the only OEM out there making anything close to the cutting edge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps Google’s temporary shift of focus to the Android tablet market would lend them time to iterate and perfect the fledgling Tensor SoC in preparation for the monumental launch of the world’s first Tensor-powered Pixelbook. In the meantime, we can all enjoy driving a premium, powerful, Google-y Android tablet that isn’t wearing a Samsung badge. I’m in. One hundred percent. Take my money. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, that is not the case. The teased Pixel tablet that briefly appeared on the screen behind Rick looked more like an e-reader or a kids Fire Tablet. That’s not to say it didn’t look like a Google device. As a matter of fact, my immediate thought was that the new Pixel tablet looked a whole lot like a Next Hub smart display with no base. As it turns out, that was no coincidence. You see, earlier this year, it was discovered that Google was working on a detachable Nest Hub-style device. Back then, I theorized that the Pixel tablet and this unannounced smart display could very well be one in the same. All signs point to this being the case and we will eventually have a Pixel tablet that pulls double duty as a mounted smart display. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, not exactly what I was hoping for but I get it. Google has leaned heavily into the smart home market and the combination of an Android tablet with the versatility of a Nest smart display makes perfect sense. You can use it to game, read the news, watch some Netflix and when you’re ready to go hands-free, just pop it on the base and you have a smart display/speaker that’s perfect for reading recipes or taking a video call. Cool. I can dig it. Now, let’s move on and talk about that future Pixelbook. Shall we?</p>\n\n\n\nSay it ain’t so…\n\n\n\n<p>Up to this point, this story is playing out like a dream come true. Even though it has been three years since the last Pixelbook was announced, we’re totally willing to wait a little longer to see a new Google Chromebook powered by in-house silicon that continues the legacy that is Pixelbook. Unfortunately, our story has now taken a twist that’s worthy of an M. Night Shyamalan movie and I am saddened to report that a new Pixelbook is no longer part of Google’s future hardware roadmap. I know. I didn’t want to tell you but you deserve to hear it from a friend. We’ll get through this together. I promise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news arrived earlier today. Reported by The Verge, the demise of the next Pixelbook comes on the heels of a company memo from CEO Sundar Pichai in which Google’s leader stated that hiring would be slowed and that certain areas of development would be paused. This wouldn’t necessarily result in cutbacks but instead, the “redeploying of resources to higher priority areas.” According to The Verge’s undisclosed source, one of the areas of development was the team in charge of the Pixelbook. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google has canceled the next version of its Pixelbook laptop and dissolved the team responsible for building it. The device was far along in development and expected to debut next year, according to a person familiar with the matter, but the project was cut as part of recent cost-cutting measures inside of Google. Members of the team have been transferred elsewhere inside the company.</p>The Verge\n\n\n\n<p>If the source is correct and this information is accurate, it looks like Google may have been planning on releasing its next Pixelbook next year. With the new Pixel Tablet likely arriving in the first half of the year, I  would wager that the target was a fall release of the Pixelbook at Google’s 2023 hardware event. That’s just my two cents. I have no idea what the company had in the works. Regardless, none of that matters now. The next Pixelbook is no more and the team will likely be dispersed to work with OEM partners in creating the next generation of ChromeOS devices but that may not be a bad thing…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.” That’s a great saying and believe that it is at the heart of much of Google’s hardware strategy. Dating all the way back to the original Google Pixel Chromebook and the Nexus family of Android phones, Google’s hardware has often taken on the form of halo devices that were meant to be a guiding light for other manufacturers. That mantra has changed a bit since the debut of the all-new Tensor-powered Pixel phones but it is still part of the fabric of which Google is woven. Like the saying above, Google often ”appears” when the Android or ChromeOS ecosystem needs a little nudge. To understand a possible reason behind Google exiting the Chromebook market right now, we need to look at the rest of that saying. The part that most of us forget. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the student is ready the teacher will appear. When the student is truly ready… The teacher will disappear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChromeOS has come of age. You may not agree and that’s okay but like it or not, Chromebooks are everywhere. Google has succeeded in bringing ChromeOS to the masses and making the relatively young operating system a mainstream staple in schools, homes, and perhaps most importantly, the enterprise sector. We can discuss that more at a later date but the fact remains, Chromebooks are here to stay. Google knows that. PC makers know it. If they didn’t, we wouldn’t have $2,000 ChromeOS devices like the HP Elite Dragonfly that have every feature and are on par with some of the nicest Windows machines on the market. Make no mistake, giant OEMs don’t gamble on a device and let them bear the name of premier device lines unless they believe that there is a market for it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this to say, I think Google knows that Chromebook manufacturers are fully on board with creating cutting-edge ChromeOS devices that rival anything out there. Maybe Google has decided that the world doesn’t need another Pixelbook. At least not right now. Let’s not forget that it wasn’t too long ago that Rick Osterloh himself put it out there that Google was out of the tablet game. It took less than three years for that to take a 180 and soon, we’ll have a brand new, Made by Google tablet to enjoy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe, just maybe, the timing is right for Google to take the Pixelbook back into the shadows. Perhaps a Google Chromebook will once again emerge when, like a mysterious super hero, it is needed. Personally, I really wanted to see a new Pixelbook powered by Google’s Tensor SoC and I know that I am not alone. The ChromeOS world should have a herald and that herald longs to be a Pixelbook but other OEMs have come alongside Google and are making ultra-premium, halo devices that can pick up the torch. As much as we want a new Pixelbook, this may be for the best. To quote Jim Gordon, maybe “the Pixelbook is the Chromebook we deserve, but not the one we need right now.”</p>\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways\n\n\n\t           \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Source: The Verge</p>",

        "description": "<p>Former federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman has accused former Attorney General Bill Barr of firing him from his post because his department’s investigations at the time threatened Trump’s 2020 reelection chances. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During an appearance on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show,” on Monday, Berman, who was the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York told host Rachel Maddow that his department was working on several cases including one involving former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in the months ahead of the election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading from a book by Berman to be published titled \"Holding the Line,\" Maddow asked the former federal prosecutor to address the notion that Barr \"no doubt believed that by removing me he could eliminate a threat to Trump's reelection.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"How was your work as U.S. attorney a threat to Trump's reelection?\" Maddow asked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Well, at the time I was fired, the Southern District of New York was working on a couple politically sensitive cases. One of those cases is the Steve Bannon 'we build the wall' case and we were very close to indicting that case around the time I got fired, and Barr knew about the case,” Berman told Maddow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once Bannon was indicted by Berman's successor, Trump pardoned Bannon, which Berman called \"outrageous.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also noted his office had also been investigating Lev Parnes and Igor Fruman, two Trump allies, who were eventually convicted of campaign finance charges that involved funneling money from a Russian tycoon into American political campaigns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier Monday, Berman told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that the Trump administration’s Department of Justice pressured him to indict former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig before the midterm elections and prosecute former Secretary of State John Kerry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump fired Berman in 2020 after he refused to resign from his position. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’ve never seen anything like that before, and I was a junior prosecutor in the Southern District in the early 90s and I’d never seen anything like that,” Berman told GMA co-anchor George Stephanopoulos. “People who have been in the office for 40 years never saw anything like that. It was unprecedented and scary.” </p>",

        "description": "<p>Nothing against all of the other Emmy winners tonight, but even the most perfectly rehearsed, elegantly delivered acceptance speech couldn’t possibly compare with Sheryl Lee Ralph’s moment in the spotlight. In the minutes after the actor won Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, she sang and beamed and soliloquized, inspiring the audience to leap to its feet again and again—and again.</p><p></p><p>Her acceptance speech was the kind of moment that television—live television, in particular—is made for and needs more of. Ralph was a joy to watch from the moment she stepped on stage: A Broadway star through and through, she took a deep breath at the mic and then broke into song, belting Dianne Reeves’s “Endangered Species” and enunciating each line with the passion of a soloist performing her last show. Then, when she moved on to the list of people she wanted to thank, she didn’t just rattle off names and networks to acknowledge. She transformed her speech into poetry, her emotions into a rhythm that struck a chord with the crowd.</p><p>[Read: 20 perfect TV shows for short attention spans]</p><p>“To anyone who has ever, ever had a dream and thought your dream wasn’t, wouldn’t, couldn’t come true, I am here to tell you that this is what believing looks like, this is what striving looks like, and don’t you ever, ever give up on you,” she said, “because … if you get a husband like mine in your corner, if you get children like mine in your corner, and if you’ve got friends like everybody who voted for me, cheered for me, loved me …” She doesn’t complete the sentence, but the sentiment is clear: Ralph is infinitely grateful, and everybody knows what she means when she chants her thank-yous afterward with her trophy in the air.</p><p>But it wasn’t just the speech itself that made Ralph’s win so brilliant. Ralph is a respected performer who has been waiting decades, since her start in the late 1970s, to be recognized on this kind of mainstream level. Many in the room, as soon as her name was called, seemed to understand how overdue her recognition had been, giving her a standing ovation even as she seemed too overwhelmed to leave her seat. And her win couldn’t have been for a more fitting role: On Abbott Elementary, the comedy about an underfunded public school, she stars as Barbara Howard, a teacher whom the protagonist, played by the show’s creator, Quinta Brunson, admires and considers her mentor. Barbara is a trailblazer; Ralph is the same.</p><p>Making live-TV magic has been a challenge for awards-show producers. Some rely on celebrity cameos, hoping to generate headline-making chatter. Some fill up the hours with comedy bits, attempting to create a viral clip or meme in the process. Some have to deal with unpleasant surprises that show the pitfalls of doing anything live. Tonight’s ceremony featured more planned moments than unplanned: Some, like the reunion of Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell, were delightful, while others, such as the dance-heavy intro, were just awkward. But Ralph’s speech was the kind of showbiz alchemy that can’t be manufactured. The Emmys producers appeared to understand that: They captured her stunned reaction along with every ovation, and never played her off as she spoke. They zoomed out, offering wide shots of the room, because that was how electrifying Ralph was: Her energy radiated into every corner—and straight into the screens of those watching at home.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Anthony Rendon underwent right wrist surgery in June, the continuation of a series of injuries that have plagued his past two seasons. The Angels announced he’d need four-to-six months to recover and proclaimed the surgery season-ending, but Rendon is holding out hope of a late-season return.</p>\n<p>“That’s always been the thing, to come back,” Rendon told reporters this afternoon (via Jeff Fletcher of the Orange County Register). “That’s what I was pushing for the whole time. I’m going to push myself, push myself. I’m going to have them push me, push me. And if it works, we’re going to listen to my body. If it doesn’t feel good, we’ll pull it back. We’re just going to push as much as my body will take.”</p>\n<p>To that end, Rendon took on-field batting practice for the first time since his surgery today. Fletcher adds that he’s been able to participate in defensive drills as well, perhaps enabling him to get back on the diamond before the season is out. There are a bit more than three weeks remaining on the schedule, with the season wrapping up on October 5.</p>\n<p>The Halos are just playing out the stretch, of course, so there’s no reason to force Rendon onto the field before he’s ready. If he’s up to playing for even a week or two, however, it could have some benefits for the club as they turn their attention to 2023. Rendon indicated he’d feel better about his offseason preparation if he were able to make it back this year and log some game action heading into the winter.</p>\n<p>Getting reinstated from the injured list this season would also expedite his return to the field in 2023. Not long after Rendon was injured, the Angels and Mariners engaged in a massive bench-clearing brawl. MLB handed the third baseman a five-game suspension for his actions during the melee. His suspension can’t be served until he’s reinstated from the IL. If he doesn’t make it back this season, Rendon would have to serve that ban to kick off next year.</p>\n<p>Rendon appeared in 45 games before the surgery, hitting .228/.324/.383 with five home runs. After a massive showing during the shortened 2020 campaign, he’s had two seasons with roughly average production with IL stints for groin, knee, hamstring, hip and wrist issues interspersed throughout. He’s under contract for another four seasons beyond this year.</p>",

Remember when one of their execs said that gamers just \"don't get what a digital secondary market can bring to them\"? Remember when their employees were so unhappy with the NFT plan that they had to hold an internal workshop about it, shortly before giving all employees NFTs of hats?</p><p>Well, despite being pretty bullheaded about their stance on NFTs and web3, even Ubisoft is now backing away from it all. In April, only a few months after launch, Ubisoft announced that there would be no more NFTs for the Ghost Recon Breakpoint title. Now, the CEO is putting a different spin on the company's once determination to introduce NFTs: \"we are still in research mode\" when it comes to web3 technologies, he said. \"We probably were not good at saying we are researching. We should have said we were working on it, and when we have something that gives you a real benefit, we'll bring it to you.\" I imagine that might come as a shock to the handful of people who actually bought the Ghost Recon Breakpoint NFTs, given they were promised \"real benefit\" back in December and are now left with useless collectibles.</p><p></p>\n        \n            \n              \n                \"Ubisoft CEO Says Company’s Interest In NFTs Was Just 'Research', No Longer Interested\"\n               , Kotaku\n            \n            \n              \n                \"Yves Guillemot: 'I think we are a company that can be proud of itself'\"\n               , GamesIndustry.biz",

        "description": "<p>Many thanks for all your good wishes on our marriage. Someone saw the picture and wrote, “Heather is betting on the future.” I am indeed.And there are reasons to be hopeful about that future.When I last wrote about the news, on Friday, Ukraine was launching a counteroffensive against the Russian troops occupying their territory, but it was still too early to be sure of what was happening. Now it is clear: over the weekend, Ukrainian forces drove Russian troops back, retaking more than 1000 square miles of Ukrainian territory and handing Russia a humiliating operational defeat. Ukraine had been indicating it would launch its offensive in the south, prompting Russia to move 15,000 to 25,000 troops to that front. Instead, it pushed forward farther north, moving with lightning speed as the Russian occupiers, already suffering from low morale, crumbled. Ukrainian plans reflected cooperation with U.S. intelligence, as well as support from weapons systems provided by allies, including HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems) from the U.S. While this will not end the crisis, it has put Russia on the defensive and turned the war in Ukraine’s favor. Noting that Russian soldiers abandoned their equipment and fled, Europe specialist Anne Applebaum noted that “[t]he fundamental difference between Ukrainian soldiers, who are fighting for their country’s existence, and Russian soldiers, who are fighting for their salary, has finally begun to matter.” This shift in the war continues the process of undermining the argument right-wing politicians have made for ending liberal democracy. They claim that it is inefficient, making democratically led countries unable to react as quickly to the modern world as countries with a strong leader, and that the secular values of democracy that emphasize equality weaken a country’s morals and ultimately weaken the country itself. As recently as May 2021, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) shared a Russian propaganda video about its troops and suggested they were superior to the American military, which was trying to demonstrate that it includes all Americans equally. He tweeted: “Holy crap. Perhaps a woke, emasculated military is not the best idea….” But Russia’s disastrous invasion of Ukraine, thwarted by Ukraine and its democratic allies, has undermined the myth of an invincible Russian army, while the invaders’ commission of war crimes has made it clear they have no moral ground to stand on. Meanwhile, internal arguments in Russia as the economy has tanked and the war gone badly have created a rash of “accidental” deaths of senior officials, suggesting that autocratic governments are anything but stable. Further, Applebaum suggests, since Putin tied his legitimacy to the success of the Ukraine invasion, its failure might turn out to be his own as well.Former president Trump openly admired Russian president Vladimir Putin, and Fox News Channel personality Tucker Carlson followed suit, backing Putin’s characterization of his invasion of Ukraine. Carlson has also celebrated Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, who has called for the replacement of liberal democracy with “illiberal democracy,” or “Christian democracy,” claiming to defend patriarchal and Christian systems. That process has involved a takeover of the country’s media, crackdowns on opposition, rampant corruption, and restrictions on voting.Carlson and right-wing leaders have praised the antiabortion and anti-immigration policies of Orbán’s political party. In September 2021, former vice president Mike Pence spoke in Budapest at a forum denouncing immigration and urging traditional social values, where he told the audience he hoped that the U.S. Supreme Court would outlaw abortion thanks to the three justices Trump put on the court. In 2022, the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) was held in Budapest, and months later, at CPAC’s convention in Texas, Orbán was a keynote speaker. In July the European Parliament (EP), which passes European legislation, took a strong stand against Hungary’s anti-LGBTQ laws and Orbán’s attack on “democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights,” and withheld billions of dollars from the country. In response, Orbán’s Fidesz party passed a resolution to weaken the European Parliament, saying European democracy was at a “dead end.” It also called for members of the EP to be chosen not by the voters of their countries, but by the parliaments of those countries.This week, members of the European Parliament will debate whether the values of the European Union are under systemic threat in Hungary. The EP is expected to declare that Hungary can no longer be considered a full democracy and consider suspending its rights within the European Union. And there are other signs that right-wing extremism is facing resistance. Today, more than 150 prominent Michigan Republicans—including a former head of the Michigan Republican Party—backed Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer for reelection. The current Michigan Republican Party has backed far-right candidates for governor, secretary of state, and attorney general and has lined up behind Trump, who made attacking Whitmer a feature of his 2020 campaign. Those Republicans jumping behind the Democratic governor note that she has signed more than 900 bipartisan bills into law and has focused on issues that are good for everyone, regardless of party. </p><p>“During her time as governor, she has focused on growing our economy with major investments, strengthening our skilled workforce, investing in the education of our children, and making government work for us,” said former Republican representative Joe Schwarz. “I know she will continue to advocate on behalf of hardworking Michiganders and that’s why I'm proud to support her for re-election this fall.” Others pointed to her protection of reproductive rights as key to their support. Whitmer is currently polling 13 points higher than her opponent, Tudor Dixon, who opposes abortion without exception.In the last week, federal grand juries have issued subpoenas to about 40 people associated with Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election, including the money raised over the lie that the election was stolen. Legal affairs columnist for the Los Angeles Times Harry Litman noted that many of the recipients were junior staffers who can testify to Trump’s behavior around January 6 and who have no legal reason not to cooperate.Last week, excerpts from a forthcoming book by former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey S. Berman revealed that Trump tried to use the Department of Justice against those he considered his enemies and to protect those he considered his friends. The Justice Department is supposed to enforce the law impartially, but “[t]hroughout my tenure as U.S. attorney,” Berman says in the book, “Trump’s Justice Department kept demanding that I use my office to aid them politically, and I kept declining—in ways just tactful enough to keep me from being fired.”Today the Senate Judiciary Committee told Attorney General Merrick Garland it would investigate the allegations.Finally, last night Trump arrived unexpectedly at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C., and today photographers recorded him meeting with a group of men on the grounds of his Virginia golf course, although they did not appear to be playing or even to have clubs.</p><p>—</p><p>Notes:</p>Kelly O'Donnell @KellyOFormer Pres.
