        "description": "It’s just another ThinkPad...or is it?\n    \n\n  I reviewed Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Fold, the first PC with a foldable screen, in late 2020. At the time, it was a very cool idea, but not particularly, shall we say, usable. Today, Lenovo has announced its second go at this, the “Next-generation” ThinkPad X1 Fold. I spent a few minutes with the device, and let me tell you: I am much more optimistic about this one. \nMuch of this new X1 Fold will be familiar to fans not just of the previous X1 Fold, but of the ThinkPad line in general. The device is outfitted with the series’s standard black and red color scheme, with the staple ThinkPad X1 logo on the lid. There’s a ThinkPad-style keyboard with a trackpoint and inverted-T arrow keys. It’s well-built, sturdy, and sleek. \nBut some changes have...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "Photo by Jamie Sabau/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Kansas City just can’t beat Lance Lynn in Chicago Lance Lynn once again had his way with the Royals at Guaranteed Rate Field in tonight’s 4-2 Kansas City loss.\nKris Bubic had a solid start by ERA, but a lousy start by FIP. He allowed baserunners in all but two of his innings. Depending on what you consider baserunners, anyway. Andrew Vaughn led off the inning lacing a base hit to left-center, but Michael A. Taylor gunned him down with an excellent throw-and-tag to Michael Massey. Despite loading the bases with one out in the first inning, and allowing a plethora of baserunners in general, Bubic managed to contain the damage to two runs, both on solo homers. Bubic was lucky that Elvis Andrus’s fifth inning shot was solo as Romy Gonzalez was cut down trying to steal second right before it. Bubic managed a 1-2-3 sixth, but he departed with the Sox holding a 2-1 lead.\nThat one run that the Royals managed with Bubic in the game was a nuke off the bat of Bobby Witt Jr. in the fourth that briefly gave Kansas City a 1-0 lead. But the Royals had no answers otherwise. Following Witt’s homer, they loaded the bases via consecutive singles from Nick Pratto and Taylor and a beaning of Massey. But Lynn snuffed the rally by coaxing a double play off the bat of Hunter Dozier. Outside the fourth inning, the Royals managed just one baserunner off Lynn in the form of a Nicky Lopez single.\nAmir Garrett came on for Bubic in the seventh and just didn’t have it tonight. He allowed three straight baserunners to begin the inning and was promptly lifted for Collin Snider. Unfortunately, Snider could not pull off a Houdini act. Two of the runs came around to score to give Chicago a 4-1 lead.\nKansas City’s offense finally began to show life in the ninth, but it was too little too late. With two outs, Taylor tripled and Massey brought him home with a single. But Sox closer Liam Hendriks stuck with the game plan against Dozier, feeding him pitches down and away and striking him out on four pitches.\nA few interesting nuggets:\n\nThe teams combined for just four extra base hits. None of them were doubles.\nThe Royals had only two at-bats with runners in scoring position.\nI mentioned earlier that Bubic had a solid outing by ERA but not by FIP. His ERA tonight: 3.00. His FIP: 9.12\nDozier had about as miserable of a night offensively as possible: 0-4 with three strikeouts and a GIDP. He stranded four runners. The only other Royals batter to strand even a single runner was MJ Melendez.\n2-5 in the Royals lineup went a combined 5-15. The rest were 1-17.\nThis is the ninth game this season that the Royals have failed to draw a walk.\nLance Lynn has made three starts against Kansas City in Chicago. In those three starts, he has totaled 22 innings with an 0.82 ERA, 27 strikeouts, and no walks.\n\nThe loss drops Kansas City to 53-78. They remain 2.5 games ahead of Detroit in the division standings. They will go for the series victory in the rubber match tomorrow afternoon.\nKris Bubic - 6 IP, 5 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 4 BB, 1 K, 2 HR\nLance Lynn - 7 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 0 BB, 8 K, 1 HR\nMichael A. Taylor - 2-4, 3B, R\nElvis Andrus - 1-4, HR, 2 RBI, R",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/3623331-federal-judge-rules-new-york-can-restrict-gun-carrying/",
        "description": "A federal judge on Wednesday ruled New York state can restrict citizens from concealing and carrying guns in public through a new law that was challenged by national firearm organizations.\n\n\n\nJudge Glenn Suddaby for the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of New York dismissed a motion for an injunction blocking the law from taking effect on Thursday, arguing the plaintiffs, the Gun Owners of America (GOA) and the Gun Owners Foundation (GOF), did not have standing to represent their members in court.\n\n\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James, who defended the new law on behalf of the state, released a statement Wednesday night saying she had successfully fended off \"baseless attacks by the gun lobby.\"\n\n\n\n“As gun violence continues to impact communities across the country, today’s decision is a victory in our efforts to protect New Yorkers,\" James said. \"Responsible gun control measures save lives and any attempts by the gun lobby to tear down New York’s sensible gun control laws will be met with fierce defense of the law. \n\n\n\n\"We will continue to defend the constitutionality of our laws to protect all New Yorkers,\" the attorney general continued.\n\n\n\nThe GOA and GOF, which challenged the constitutionality of the law on the First, Fourteenth and Second Amendments, are likely to appeal the case to the U.S. Second Circuit Court. \n\n\n\nAhead of the ruling on Wednesday, the GOA tweeted that New York's new law \"would essentially make all of NY a gun free zone and infringes upon the rights of its citizens.\"\n\n\n\nNew York passed the Concealed Carry Improvement Act (CCIA) in July, just days after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a previous state law requiring a proper cause for those who wish to conceal and carry in public.\n\n\n\nThe CCIA requires applicants for a concealed carry permit to undergo 16 hours of classroom training and two hours of live-fire exercises. Applicants would also be subjected to a review of social media accounts for the past three years to assess character, a rule coming in the wake of deadly mass shootings.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, carrying a firearm in amusement parks, schools, churches, subways and other places deemed sensitive by the state would be prohibited. Gun owners would also need to gain permission from property owners to bring a gun on private property.\n\n\n\nThe CCIA also requires four character references who can attest to the applicant's \"good character,\" a point the GOA challenged as subjective. The plaintiffs also challenged the sensitive locations provision determined by the state and the training requirements, as well as other aspects of the law.\n\n\n\nSuddaby, while dismissing the plaintiff's request for an injunction blocking the CCIA from taking place, delivered a mixed opinion on each of the challenged counts but seemed inclined to back the plaintiffs if the case had went the full distance.\n\n\n\n\"The undersigned is left with a strong sense of the safety that a licensed concealed handgun regularly provides, or would provide, to the many law-abiding responsible citizens in the state too powerless to physically defend themselves in public without a handgun,\" Suddaby wrote.\n\n\n\nHe was in favor of the plaintiff's arguments that the \"good character\" requirement was based on \"vague, subjective criteria.\"\n\n\n\nThe judge also disagreed with the state including a list of locations barring gun owners from carrying in \"sensitive\" locations, which he said includes places that are \"nonsensitive by nature.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, Suddaby did back the state on requirements for training, applicants to submit four character references, attend an in-person interview with an officer and submit to a social media background check.\n\n\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) tweeted her support for the judge's dismissal after the ruling.\n\n\n\n\"This is a just and right decision, and our smart, sensible gun laws will go into effect as planned tomorrow to&nbsp;keep New Yorkers safe,\" she wrote.",

        "description": "Liam Hendriks celebrates after closing out the game in the ninth inning. | David Banks-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  South Siders pick up much-needed win, with solid performances all around The Chicago White Sox beat the Kansas City Royals, 4-2, to improve their record to 64-66. It was a great all-around effort from the offense, defense, and pitching to gain a game on Cleveland and Minnesota. \nThe White Sox threatened to score in the bottom of the first inning off of lefty Kris Bubic, but couldn’t do any damage with bases loaded and one out. Lance Lynn blew through the first three innings with no hits, and it wasn’t until the top of the fourth inning that the Royals got on the board, with a solo home run from Bobby Witt Jr. Josh Harrison and Romy González combined for an inning ending double-play to end any other threats. \nAJ Pollock took some offense to that Royals lead, and immediately fired back with a solo home run in the bottom of the fourth inning.\n\nThank you very much, Elvis. \n\nAndrus hit his first home run in a White Sox uniform, and boy, did it go far. \nThis one broke the tie, and gave the White Sox a 2-1 lead. \nLynn continued to silently dominate his way through the lineup, pitching seven solid innings with just four hits, one run, and eight strikeouts. This performance moved his ERA down to 4.70. Safe to say he’s back?\n\nBubic was done with his night and replaced by Amir Garrett to start the seventh inning. Bubic took a tough loss, going six innings with five hits, two runs, one strikeout, and four walks. \nGarrett immediately got into some trouble after a leadoff walk to Gavin Sheets and back-to-back singles by Harrison and González. Garrett got the hook, for Collin Snider, and Andrus went on to score an RBI ground out to extend the lead to 3-1. \n\nJosé Abreu added some insurance with a two-out RBI single to score González. \nKendall Graveman started the top of the eighth inning and was thankful to see this leaping catch from González at second base. I never would have thought González would be mentioned this much in a story at the end of August, but here we are. \n\nLuis Robert checked into the game in the top of the ninth inning as a defensive replacement, so it’s good to see he is alive and well, and hopefully ready to play again soon. \nLiam Hendriks was in to start the ninth, and was rudely interrupted by a little bit of a two-out rally from the Royals starting with a Michael A. Taylor triple and Michael Massey single to cut the lead to 4-2. Hunter Dozier came to the plate as the tying run, but struck out to end the game. \n\n\n\n  pic.twitter.com/T99MkPsFy1— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nHopefully the team can gain some momentum from this win, as they look to close out tomorrow by taking the series. Game time will be at 1:10 p.m., and surprise ace Johnny Cueto will be on the mound against a righty with a pretty cool mustache, Daniel Mengden. Get ready for the quick turnaround tomorrow, and hopefully a win!",

        "description": "Power surge: Micker Adolfo launched a solo blast to give the Knights an early lead. | Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  A runaway victory by the Dash highlighted a 2-2 day for the affiliates   \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nThe Knights fell behind early on, and could never quite catch back up to the Bulls.\nMicker Adolfo got the party started for Charlotte in the bottom of the second. Adolfo’s 12th home run gave the Knights a 1-0 lead, but the Knights did not remain ahead for long.\n\n\nOH, MICKER! That's his 12th homer of the season! pic.twitter.com/QrfpRJY3Y2— Charlotte Knights (@KnightsBaseball) August 31, 2022\n\n\n\nKnights starter Jason Bilous got through two scoreless innings, but he could not avoid the long ball in the third. Jim Haley led off the inning with a solo homer to tie it, and control eluded Bilous after that. After a walk, a single, and another walk, the bases were loaded. Then, with one out, Rene Pinto blew the game open with a grand slam that made the score 5-1. Bilous retired one more batter, but did not make it out of the third inning.\nIn the fifth, Tristan Gray took Lincoln Henzman deep to center, and that blast made the score 7-1. With that blast, Gray boosted his impressive home run total to 29.\nThe Knights cut into their six-run deficit in the sixth, when Mark Payton set the table with a walk, and Lenyn Sosa launched a two-run homer. Unfortunately, it was not enough. Reliever J.B. Olson gave back those two runs in the seventh (though one was unearned), and the deficit was too much to overcome.\nIn garbage time, Xavier Fernández drove in a run with an RBI single, and Blake Rutherford and Tyler Neslony added a solo home run apiece.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nThe Barons offense had a rough night, so despite a strong pitching performance, Birmingham fell short.\nBarons starter Sean Burke cruised through his first three innings, but he made a pair of mistakes in the fourth. Those mistakes ultimately decided this low-scoring game. With one out in the fourth, Kameron Misner doubled, and Ronny Simon launched a home run to give Montgomery a 2-0 lead.\nTyler Osik promptly cut the deficit in half in the fifth, when he hit his first home run with Birmingham and his 11th homer of the season.\n\n\nTyler Osik cuts the lead in half with his first Double-A home run   pic.twitter.com/ckKcYrhyIC— Birmingham Barons (@BhamBarons) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nThe relievers kept the good times rolling, allowing zero runs on only one hit in 4 1⁄3 innings. Unfortunately, the offense got quiet, and scoring opportunities were hard to come by. The Barons finished 0-for-3 with runners in scoring position and were kept off the scoreboard for the rest of the game.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nThe Dash offense exploded in the latter portion of this game, and as a result, Winston-Salem won decisively.\nStarting pitcher and Indiana Hoosier Tommy Sommer only allowed one hit through three innings, but he ran into trouble in the fourth. After a leadoff double and a walk, the Grasshoppers executed a double-steal to put two in scoring position. After two productive outs, it was a 2-0 ballgame. Given the way the Dash had been hitting up until that point, it seemed that Sommer would get charged with a hard-luck loss.\nAs it turned out, though, Sommer made it through six innings without allowing any additional runs, and the Dash came to life in the seventh. With one out, Jason Matthews started the rally by drawing a four-pitch walk. Taishi Nakawake continued to set the table with a single, to bring the potential go-ahead run to the plate. Caberea Weaver was the batter representing that potential go-ahead run, and he delivered a three-run blast to turn the game around.\nIn the eighth, the Dash put the game out of reach. The top of the eighth went like this: Andy Atwood singled, Ben Norman struck out, James Beard walked, Matthews singled, Nakawake hit into a sacrifice fly (that made the score 4-2), Weaver tripled (6-2), Alsander Womack doubled (7-2), Colby Smelley walked, Riley Jepson walked, and Atwood doubled (9-2).\nIn the ninth, which was garbage time, Beard added a solo home run to get the Dash into double digits.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nKannapolis was kept off the scoreboard in eight out of nine innings, but they made one big inning count during this victory.\nIn the third, with the game still scoreless, Wilber Sánchez led off with a single. After another single by Jordan Sprinkle, the Cannon Ballers had runners on the corners with no outs. The big inning hit a speed bump when Brooks Baldwin struck out, but Troy Claunch drove in the first run of the game with a single. The next three Cannon Ballers got hits, too. Benyamin Bailey and Jacob Burke hit back-to-back doubles, and Victor Torres added a single. By the end of the hit parade, Kannapolis had a 5-0 lead.\nMeanwhile, starter Jonah Scolaro was on top of his game. In six innings of work, Scolaro allowed two hits, zero walks, struck out eight. Most importantly, he kept Lynchburg off of the board. As a result, he helped put Kannapolis in an excellent position to win this game.\nThe game was drama-free until the bottom of the ninth, when Lynchburg threatened to make an enormous comeback against reliever Adisyn Coffey. Coffey allowed three runs on three hits, and the potential tying run stepped up to the plate with two outs. However, Coffey got a clutch strikeout to wrap it up.",

        "description": "Porter Hodge | Chloe Trofatter / USA TODAY NETWORK\n    \n\n  Wade Miley made a rehab start in South Bend, but Porter Hodge was the pitching star. James Triantos has a big day in Myrtle Beach.  In the past, the minor league season would be ending this weekend. Instead, we’ve got a few weeks left to go.\nIowa Cubs\nThe Iowa Cubs were boarded and seized by the Columbus Clippers (Guardians), 7-0.\nIt was a rough start for Anderson Espinoza, who gave up a run in the first and five more in the third to take the loss. His final line was six runs on six hits over 2.2 innings. Espinoza walked one and struck out three.\nThe I-Cubs had three hits tonight, all singles.\nTennessee Smokies\nThe Tennessee Smokies stopped the Mississippi Braves, 3-1.\nRiley Thompson picked up his first win of the year after he threw five scoreless innings, allowing just two hits. He walked two and struck out three.\nPeyton Remy threw two scoreless innings in relief of Thompson and then Hunter Bigge came on and got the save. Bigge did give up a run with two out in the ninth inning, so his final line was one run on one hit and three walks over two innings. Bigge struck out three.\nLeft fielder Nelson Maldonado hit a two-run double in the second inning. He was 1 for 4.\nCenter fielder Zach Davis went 2 for 4.\nSouth Bend Cubs\nThe South Bend Cubs wrenched the Lansing Lugnuts (Athletics), 4-2. The win reduced South Bend’s magic number for clinching a second-half title to five with ten games to play. \nWade Miley made a rehab start in this game and allowed both Lugnuts runs in the second inning. Miley finished the game allowing two runs on five hits over 3.2 innings. Miley struck out two and walked no one, but he did hit one batter.\nThe win went to Porter Hodge, who basically came on as a starting pitcher to start the fourth inning and went the rest of the way. Over five innings, Hodge gave up no runs and three hits. He struck out six and walked just one.\nDH B.J. Murray Jr. connected for a solo home run in the third inning, his seventh this season and fourth with South Bend. Murray went 1 for 3 with a walk and he scored twice.\nCatcher Pablo Aliendo broke a 2-2 tie in the fifth inning with a two-run home run, his seventh this season. Aliendo went 1 for 4.\nSouth Bend scored four runs on four hits. But two of those hits were home runs and they walked five times while striking out only three times.\nHighlights. Be sure to check out the unbelievable (and admittedly lucky) double play that Hodge turned in the ninth inning at the 1:52 mark. \n\nMyrtle Beach Pelicans\nThe Myrtle Beach Pelicans split a doubleheader with the Charleston RiverDogs (Rays), losing game one 5-1 and winning the second game 5-2.\nStarter Michael Arias made his first appearance for Myrtle Beach and he only lasted one inning. Arias gave up three runs on two hits and two walks. He did strike out three.\nThird baseman James Triantos hit a solo home run in the fifth inning to account for the Pelicans only run in game one. It was Triantos’ sixth home run this year. He was 2 for 3. \nTriantos’ home run.\n\n\nJames Triantos is having himself a day. After going 2-3 with a HR in the 1st game of DH, he singles in a pair of runs in his first AB golf GM 2. pic.twitter.com/rRtRusXjOO— Jordan Miller (@Miller_MiLB) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nIn game two, starter Luis A. Rodriguez went three innings and gave up two runs on four hits. He struck out six and walked two.\nThe win went to Chase Watkins, who relieved Rodriguez and tossed three scoreless innings. Watkins gave up three hits. He struck out four and walked no one.\nFrankie Scalzo Jr. pitched a perfect seventh inning and got the save. Scalzo struck out one.\nShortstop Josue Huma hit a solo home run in the fifth inning, his fourth this season. Huma went 1 for 4 with two runs scored and two runs driven in.\nRight fielder Ezequiel Pagan was 2 for 4 with a stolen base. \nFirst baseman Liam Spence went 2 for 2 with a walk and a stolen base Spence scored one run.\nTriantos had a two-run single in the first inning of game two. He went 1 for 4.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/royals-planning-to-select-daniel-mengden.html",
        "description": "The Royals have listed right-hander Daniel Mengden as the probable starter for tomorrow&#8217;s game against the White Sox (h/t to Anne Rogers of MLB.com). They&#8217;ll have to formally select his contract to add him to the roster, but they won&#8217;t need to make any corresponding moves to do so. Active rosters expand from 26 to 28 players with the calendar flipping to September, and Kansas City already has an opening on the 40-man roster.\nMengden will be up for the second time this season, although he&#8217;ll be making his first start of the campaign. Signed to a minor league deal over the winter, he was promoted to the majors in the middle of June. He worked out of manager Mike Matheny&#8217;s bullpen during his first stint, making four appearances and tossing 4 1/3 innings of two-run ball, striking out six without walking a batter. Despite that quality showing, the Royals nevertheless ran Mengden through waivers and outrighted him back to Triple-A Omaha.\nWhile Mengden hasn&#8217;t started an MLB game in two seasons, he does have a fair bit of rotation experience. He worked primarily as a starter during his early-career run with the A&#8217;s, opening 48 of his 60 appearances with Oakland between 2016-20. Mengden&#8217;s pitch-to-contact approach led to some decent results in a spacious Oakland ballpark early in his tenure, but he ran into more trouble from 2019 onward as his walk tallies escalated.\nMengden has worked primarily from the rotation with the Storm Chasers. He&#8217;s started 17 of 21 outings, working to a 4.55 ERA across 91 innings. The Texas A&amp;M product has struck out 19.5% of opponents against a heightened 12.8% walk percentage in the minors this season.",

        "description": "Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Two costly errors and one bad pitch sinks New York’s quiet offense. This was a game of contradictions. Gerrit Cole, the strikeout king, lived off groundouts while Patrick Sandoval engineered whiffs. The Yankees’ defense shone early before giving away the lead in the sixth. And in a series that solidified, if not cemented, Aaron Judge’s AL MVP case, Shohei Ohtani had the biggest hit, a three-run bomb that put the Angels on top for good. In the end, the Yankees lost 3-2 to a team closer to the worst record in baseball than a playoff spot. It was their fourth such loss, two apiece to the Angels and A’s to close out this terrible West Coast trip and even more dismal August. \nI wish I knew what the prescription for this team was. I wish I knew why nobody other than Aaron Judge can seemingly make anything happen offensively. The guys trusted for power, like Giancarlo Stanton and Josh Donaldson, can’t provide it. The guys trusted to get on base, Isiah Kiner-Falefa, DJ LeMahieu, and Andrew Benintendi, went 0-10 with a single walk. Let’s try and get through this recap, folks.\nLike I said, there were some legitimately great defensive plays. Donaldson had a heck of a throw from third — perhaps foreshadowing or irony given what happened later, but I don’t know for sure — and Aaron Hicks had probably the finest play of his tough season:\n\nFor what little it’s worth now, the team did get out to a 2-0 lead, while Cole blanked the Angels through the first five. Donaldson was the beneficiary of a weird bounce, as his batted ball ricocheted off David Fletcher into left for a double. A wild pitch moved him to third, and Gleyber Torres made the trip home easy:\n\nJose Trevino moved ‘em over, before Hicks brought ‘em in with a sac fly, giving the Yankees a crooked number in the fifth inning.\nThen came the sixth, when the bad things happened.\nCole had posted a solid, but odd start, with just two strikeouts in the first five, but outside of Ohtani’s ball to the warning track he hadn’t really been in major trouble all night. Fletcher got some of his luck back, hitting a ball to Donaldson that would have been a tough play no matter what, but Donaldson’s wild throw made that a certainty and Fletcher advanced to second anyway.\nWith one out, Cole got a weak ground ball from Mike Trout to Kiner-Falefa, the alleged solid defensive shortstop who’s an upgrade over any possible other options in the entire organization. IKF fielded the ball cleanly and made the play for the out muffed it, putting two men on on the second straight error, and with Ohtani coming to the plate.\n\nClay Holmes continued his strong return, facing 1-2-3 in LA’s order and sitting them down without incident, K’ing Fletcher and Ohtani. In series like this, you need to find something to be positive about, and Jonathan Loáisiga and Clay Holmes returning to form might end up being the brightest silver lining.\nStill, as bad as this recap sounds, the Yankees were only down a single run. I thought Aaron Boone should have pinch-hit Oswaldo Cabrera for either IKF or Hicks in the eighth inning, but Boone decided to save the rookie for the ninth, where Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton both walked to start the frame.\nAfter that, it was a microcosm of the problem plaguing this offense for so long. If the two big stars can’t get the big hit, nobody can. Both Donaldson and Torres went down swinging, and then it was Cabrera’s turn. He bounced out harmlessly to first to end the game.\nThis West Coast trip sucked. The Yankees went 3-4 against two teams that they could very well have swept, and should have lost no more than twice. August has been a month of hell for this club — its worst since 1991 — and hopefully with the calendar turning, so will the tide of the Yankees.\nNew York gets an offday tomorrow and takes on the Rays in Tampa starting Friday, so it does not get easier from here, particularly since their old 15.5-game AL East lead is the smallest it’s been since June 3rd. Tampa made up nine games in August alone and is nearly breathing down the Yankees’ necks at six back with this Trop series looming. Domingo Germán gets the ball in a 7:10pm Eastern start down in Florida.\nBox Score",

It also makes NO CLAIM that Trump declassified anything. THAT'S! A! CONFESSION! (2:52) He also confessed on social media (4:51) So why hasn't he been perp walked? Finger-printed? Because the DOJ is still afraid of affecting the election! Not 2024, but the November midterms, even though Trump isn't running in them - merely because he's endorsed people who are! (7:45) The problem is, the delay in arresting Trump benefits those he's endorsed, and the \"no electoral interference rule\" is only in play because Trump has repeatedly stalled. (9:20) This makes the next 68 days until the midterms will be hell, because the revelations are still coming. Does \"the\" photo show Trump stole Iran Nuclear Deal documents? (12:17) And Trump's own lawyer Alina Habba may have inadvertently convicted him of espionage but she (13:10) dismisses espionage as a \"mundane statute\" which will come as a surprise to the Rosenbergs.(14:32) This is now an open and shut case. Good God, he's CONFESSED! Charge him already! I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!\r\nB-BLOCK (19:32) EVERY DOG HAS ITS DAY: Arnold in Downey (20:42) Postscripts to the News: Palin loses, Mastriano and Ron Johnson employ conspiracy whack jobs (24:10) IN SPORTS: Serena did it, the Marlins toss back a player named Fishman, and the 35th Anniversary of Dave Bresnahan's Great Baseball Potato Caper (29:17) THE WORST PERSONS IN THE WORLD: Chuck Todd says he's not fired, by tweeting a link to a Mark Twain quote Mark Twain never wrote, in a cable he never sent, about a story that never ran. Par for the course.\r\nC-BLOCK (35:30) THINGS I PROMISED NOT TO TELL: Back-to-school-days means only one thing to me: the Cornell History professor who graded our papers right after he watched his beloved New York Giants - and was grading them right after the Giants pulled off the worst choke loss in their history!See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

        "description": "Not in the spirit of slow blogging, this is just a slow blogger, catching up on a presentation done back on July 12. When I was a kid blogger, I&#8217;d have it written before the end of the day. C&#8217;est la blog.\n\n\n\nI do relish (possible pun warning) an opportunity to tap back into the work I did with the BCcampus H5P Kitchen project especially as I have hardly done much since the lights dimmed in the kitchen. But it was that work that led Anthony from OpenStax to reach out to me a few months ago. According to him, they are hearing of interest from the authors and likely paying attention to what Pressbooks and LibreTexts are &#8220;cooking&#8221; with offering H5P integration into open textbook authoring.\n\n\n\nI was offered a chance to do an online presentation for the July 12-13 Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board&#8217;s  Digital Learning Summit. I suggested a two part show, a bit of a talk/demonstration of H5P followed by a hands on workshop.\n\n\n\nThen I had my smile on when the conference planners said they would ask for my slides in advance. &#8220;I don&#8217;t do slides!&#8221; and let them know instead they would get a web site.\n\n\n\nI reached into my bag of tricks and repurposed what I did previously, in &#8220;presenting&#8221; H5P with H5P, and not only that, riffing/copying/sealing the Arley Cruthers approach of a &#8220;branching&#8221; presentation. This was not just yank some slides of the shelf and change the title slide, but a thorough refresh. \n\n\n\nIn sticking (like sticky dough) with the cooking metaphor, this was a &#8220;Tasting Tour&#8221;of H5P\n\n\n\n\nTasting Tour: Branching Into H5P\nhttps://kitchen.opened.ca/tasting-tour/\n\n\n\nI had a food metaphor dripping description that may have gotten smoothed down in the conference program, but I am staying with it.\n\n\n\nNot to be confused with a brand name sauce, H5P exemplifies perhaps the best attributes of OER. As an open source platform independent tool, H5P produces web standard interactive content laced with attribution and open licenses, but also in a sharable form prime for reuse and remix. That’s all technically impressive, but for educators, the value it provides is the ability to embed in the context of learning managerial the kinds of practice activities that so effectively reinforce learning.This opening session is part choose your own introduction adventure making use of the H5P Branching Scenario content type but also an opportunity to first sample hands on a wide buffet of H5P examples in the subject areas of interest to you. Once you have a taste of H5P…https://kitchen.opened.ca/tasting-tour/\n\n\n\nYou are invited to explore it on your own, just some highlights are spelled out below. The overall structure is not quite the &#8220;break the boat&#8221; level&#8211; the wide set of choices in the middle are the main branches, with a series of screens, interactions, or sometimes another level of options, before a branch that allows a viewer to go back to the main menu or exit stage left.\n\n\n\nOverall picture of this branching presentation&#8211; this ain&#8217;t no slide deck@\n\n\n\nIn the part of the Alan trying to be too clever with the metaphor of presenting H5P with H5P, in the intro I reached for the old Palmolive laundry soap ads with &#8220;Madge&#8221; to show a bit of a Course Presentation with some interactive video and drag the words.\n\n\n\nMadge, you are soaking in H5P, where I used an interactive video using one of the old TV commercials\n\n\n\nNew in this version, I tossed in a survey of sorts (in the Zoom based presentation I asked for responses in the chat) for everyone&#8217;s level of experience in H5P. For the 90+ or so in this session most were relatively new to it. I set up the questions as a branch:\n\n\n\nBranching Question about experience/awareness of H5P\n\n\n\nThis may be clever or not, but all of these branches go to the main navigation screen (another set of branches, see below), but I just used the feedback options to suggest paths worth exploring.\n\n\n\nA suggested guide for what comes next\n\n\n\nAnd this all roads lead to these branches which is the main menu as it were for the &#8220;presentation&#8221;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother big addition to this version was having more H5P &#8220;studios&#8221; to share&#8211; sites that offer a group of users an H5P creation platform, but also a public searchable interface for finding examples by discipline, content type, etc.  Originally there was just the eCampusOntario H5P Studio, but now I could link to the LibreStudio and the H5P Catalogue site in India, as well as a demo version of the Learnful Studio (a demo version by Yasin Dahi, the genius behind eCampusOntario and LibreText&#8217;s studios). Yasin had set up access for followup workshop (thought we never got quite that far).\n\n\n\nAlso brand new was a buffet of new examples that came from a variety of colleagues in a discussion topic I ran in OEG Connect (that was called an H5P Food Truck, the metaphor never is too over baked).\n\n\n\nAgain like last time, all the references are provided on the presentation site in an H5P Accordion sitting below the main presentation.\n\n\n\nI did not snag the chat, but it was very lively. A lot of the questions went down the usual path of asking about collecting data for assessment, which is understandable, but also not my focus. I am more interested in providing good quality practice activities that can let the learner determine their level of understanding, not report it back.\n\n\n\nThe other typical block with H5P is that authoring is now pretty easy to do, especially with the Lumi desktop tool but it does get more challenging to explain how you get what you made into a place you can use as a publishing source that can be embedded where you need it.\n\n\n\nAnd That Was Just the Tasting Tour\n\n\n\nThe second half of the show was a hands on workshop, again I remixed my one from the 2012 Arizona OER Workshop into a new updated version.\n\n\n\n\nInto the Kitchen: Cooking and Spicing Up OERs with H5P\n\n\n\n\nI knew and told the audience we would likely not cover it all, but the whole premise is that all the materials are there to come back to later. Again, my description was:\n\n\n\nIf the opening session made you hungry for more, we venture next into a direct experience remixing, editing, creating your own H5P content. Often these types of sessions expose you to the overwhelming array of content types — just grabbing a random tool from the kitchen drawer is no way to learn to cook. Like the cooking guide Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, perhaps there are basic elements of H5P cooking.So we will start first with taking one of those samples from the tasting tour or one you can find from the shelf, then opening it up in the H5P authoring platform to modify and understand how it was made. Yes, remix is in the mix.We will provide some suggestions for places you can publish and share what you made. Finally, with some first experiences in the H5P Kitchen, you ought to have everything you need to start creating your own dishes from scratch.All of the activities here will be highly participatory, ideally fun, and all of the materials will be available so you can come back and cook at your own pace.https://kitchen.opened.ca/dls22/\n\n\n\nThe first part if somewhat a follow or a little overlap from the tasting tour- before you start madly grabbing for tools, spend some time finding dishes that inspire you. Or You Don’t Start Cooking By Reaching into the Utensil Drawer.\n\n\n\nThe second introduces the Lumi tool and we encourage participants to download an existing H5P piece of content (either my skimpy demos or something they found earlier). Ir brings home the key feature of H5P content being remixable, hence Remixing from H5P Hors d’oeuvres.\n\n\n\nThe last part was meant to go beyond the simpler tools&#8211; Stepping Up to More Complex H5P Dishes and I had grand ambitions we would get to using the Learnful Studio demo, but alas, the clock went way too fast.\n\n\n\nThat Was That\n\n\n\nI came, I presented, and left. It was a bit of parachuting presenting. But I always leave folks with materials I&#8217;d hope are usable later.\n\n\n\nPeople are readily excited an interested in H5P, but it is a bit deceptive because it looks like something you can go get a demo, tinker with, and be off and running in an hour workshop. \n\n\n\nBut it&#8217;s an onion, you find more and more nuances the more you use it. Many of the key features are a few layers down. The feedback takes a while to learn to use effectively (and I am still on that learning curve).\n\n\n\nStill.\n\n\n\nI think it is maybe one of the best things out there in the OER land. It&#8217;s platform independent and it produces standalone web standard content. H5P has the ability to carry all of the key license data with it (if people enter all the metadata), and what it makes is eminently remixable.\n\n\n\nPlus it just tastes good!\n\n\n\nThanks Anthony and the rest of the folks at the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board for inviting me to the Digital Learning Summit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Image: Foreground sign from Wallace Island Intersection flickr photo by cogdogblog shared under a Creative Commons (BY) license remixed by Alan Levine (me) to change text on signs and replace background with El Capitan, Guadalupe Mountains National Park, Texas flickr photo by Ken Lund shared under a Creative Commons (BY-SA) license yielding a remix license of &#8230;.

But what could be the effect?Keeping the heating turned off is one surefire way of reducing gas and electricity bills this winter, but it could come at the expense of people’s health – particularly those with heart and lung conditions.According to a survey of more than 2,000 UK adults, 23% are planning to do without heating this winter, while about 70% said they planned to turn their heating on less. Yet each centigrade degree reduction below 18C in Britain has been calculated to correspond with an extra 3,500 deaths. Here are the main ways in which cold homes can contribute to worse health.

        "description": "We scored twice against a likely playoff team! You may as well just skip down to the Up Next Poll.... This game started poorly and only got worse. The best pitching performance Arizona had was Carson Kelly’s 1.1 to close it out. \n\n\n\nToday's Lineups\n\n\n\n\nPHILLIES\nDIAMONDBACKS\n\n\n\n\nKyle Schwarber - LF\nKetel Marte - DH\n\n\nRhys Hoskins - 1B\nJake McCarthy - RF\n\n\nAlec Bohm - 3B\nEmmanuel Rivera - 3B\n\n\nBryce Harper - DH\nChristian Walker - 1B\n\n\nJ.T. Realmuto - C\nStone Garrett - LF\n\n\nJean Segura - 2B\nCooper Hummel - C\n\n\nMatt Vierling - RF\nDaulton Varsho - CF\n\n\nBrandon Marsh - CF\nSergio Alcantara - 2B\n\n\nEdmundo Sosa - SS\nGeraldo Perdomo - SS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBailey Falter - LHP\nTommy Henry - LHP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInnings 1-3\nTommy Henry didn’t have his stuff tonight. It was all bad for him in the first third of the game. A whole bunch of baserunners in the first, not helped by a double error on Perdomo, but he also got out of the inning with some nice defense behind him. The second inning went swimmingly (after a rather stern talking to from Stromm mind you). But the third was when the wheels really came off. There were walks, wild pitches, hard contact... A very nice double play (after Lovullo successfully challenged a safe call at first) finally ended the Sucking Baseball Wound. \nMeanwhile, the Diamondbacks’ bats didn’t show up at all in these innings. Something called a Bailey Falter was perfect at the end of the third. There wasn’t even a great defensive play to put any hope into. All hope came from Monday night’s franchise record-setting rebound.\n5-0 PHILLIES\nInnings 4-6\nHenry had a great fourth. No one reached base and despite a delay of game for a foul ball that caught Hummel in an extremely unfortunate location, the inning felt nice. But as Michael pointed out in the GameDay Thread, Henry was only effective in the even innings. Two batters into the fifth, no one was out, and Moronta relieved the rookie. He managed to get three outs, but it also wasn’t pretty. Almost like the Phillies didn’t want to get swept by an afterthought team or something. Ginkel pitched the sixth. He didn’t escape flawless, but he did strand two runners in scoring position and **only** gave up one run...\nFalter didn’t exactly falter in the fourth, but he did give up a home run to McCarthy! It was a no doubt beauty. No one else could do any damage though. Until the fifth at least. Garrett got on base with an infield single (don’t be fooled, he isn’t supremely fast like some other outfielders on the team; Hoskins couldn’t corral the ball and Falter failed to expeditiously run to cover the bag). Didn’t matter though, no one else did anything. Marte had what I’m going to call a hamstring double to dead center in the sixth (I could be biased by all the speed of younger legs though). And he did advance to third on a fly out by McCarthy. But Rivera could convert with two outs. \n10-1 PHILLIES\nInnings 7-9\nMantiply came in for the seventh. Sosa immediately hit a double to left that Garrett didn’t really play super well, but no extras bases were had. Schwarber singled him home after the ump took a pitch off his forearm (the bruise formed FAST). No other damage done. Frias got .2 of the eighth. That’s all that needs to be said about it (5ER 7ER on 6 hits). Carson Kelly pitched. It wasn’t pretty, but he got the final out. He also pitched the ninth, allowing no runs; the CATCHER THROWING 50MPH allowed fewer runs than all the Arizona “pitchers” who played tonight. \nWalker got a hit in the seventh. Garrett even followed it up with a hit of his own. Two runners at the same time! After Hummel grounded out to short, Falter was removed from the game for injury (right groin tightness); I hope he’s ok. Dude pitched a good game against a bad offense. Whichever reliever came in doused the threat. The bottom of the eighth was completely uneventful. Rivera singled in the ninth, followed by a Walker single as well. Garrett then grounded into a double play that scored Rivera. Hummel also singled. Varsho couldn’t keep the too little too late “rally” going. Game over. \n18-2 PHILLIES WIN\nConclusion\nOH. MAHY. GAWD! We had the chance to sweep. We. Did. Not. Sweep. Neither Arizona pitching, nor hitting showed up tonight. The highlights were McCarthy’s home run and sadly, Carson Kelly’s pitching... Of particular low notes: Henry’s inability to adjust in real time, the defense as a whole (shout out to Garrett’s attempts to learn Chase Field with minimal playing time, despite the poor look of the eyeball test), and the hocking of bats/balls signed by players we all suffered through for the first few innings (congrats to cancer research, but it was old after the top of the first).\nFangraphs\n  \n        \n  \nCaligula: Tommy Henry (-30.1% WPA)\nSpartacus: Jake McCarthy (2.7% WPA)\nComment of the Day\nI ignored rec’s tonight because none went red, and frankly it was just a lot of sarcasm and negativity (justified, but not my preference for CoTD tonight). So let’s all try out best to hold onto this nugget from Michael. \n  \n        \n  \nUp Next\nTomorrow the Milwaukee Brewers come to town for a 4-game set over the weekend. Game time is 6:40pm Arizona Time. Brandon Woodruff (9-3, 3.31 ERA) takes the mound for the Midwesterners. Arizona will send Merrill Kelly (11-5, 2.97 ERA) out there. Rosters also expand tomorrow, so expect a Kyle Nelson addition to the bullpen and some bat from AAA (Beer? Luplow? Herrera?). Who do you think it will be?",

        "description": "Not saying that Trump supporters are desperately trying to find a way to spin his theft, and subsequent hiding, of classified documents from the U.S. government, but there was actually an op-ed today in a major paper suggesting that the documents described by the Department of Justice and shown in last night&#8217;s explosive photo were just props because stacks of paper make Trump feel important.&nbsp;I&#8217;m going to do the author of that piece a favor and not link to it in the notes.Shortly afterward, Trump tore the ground out from under that argument&#8212;and most of the others his supporters were trying to make&#8212;by posting a complaint on his Truth Social network about the FBI photo documenting the stolen classified documents. &#8220;There seems to be confusion as to the &#8216;picture&#8217; where documents were sloppily thrown on the floor and then released photographically for the world to see, as if that&#8217;s what the FBI found when they broke into my home. Wrong! They took them out of cartons and spread them around on the carpet&#8230;.&#8221;&nbsp;Lawyers point out that this is an admission that he had the documents and knew it.&nbsp;His lawyer Alina Habba then went onto the Fox News Channel to complain about the photo and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m somebody who has been in his office&#8230;. I do have firsthand knowledge&#8230;. I have never, ever, seen that&#8230;. That is not the way his office looks&#8230;. He has guests frequently there.&#8221; His office had classified information in it, and his lawyer just said he entertains guests there. This is an intelligence nightmare.&nbsp;Tonight, just before the deadline of 8:00, Trump&#8217;s lawyers filed a response to yesterday&#8217;s filing by the Department of Justice about the classified intelligence he hid at Mar-a-Lago. His lawyers argued that the FBI&#8217;s struggle to recover stolen classified documents was &#8220;the standard give-and-take between former Presidents and NARA regarding Presidential library contents.&#8221;&nbsp;In Alaska tonight, Mary Peltola, who is Yup&#8217;ik, won a special election for the House seat left vacant after the death of Republican Don Young. A tribal fisheries manager and close family friend of the Youngs, Peltola defeated former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who was endorsed by former president Trump, to become the first Democrat in 50 years and the first woman ever to hold the seat and, while she was at it, the first Alaska Native ever elected to Congress. After winning Alaska&#8217;s House seat through ranked-choice voting, Peltola will again compete for it with Palin and her other challenger, Nick Begich III, in the regular election in November.Executive Director of Voters of Tomorrow Santiago Mayer pointed out that the last time a Democrat sat in Alaska&#8217;s House seat was the same year the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade. &#8220;If that&#8217;s not a&#8230;sign,&#8221; he tweeted, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what is.&#8221;&#8212;Notes:Ilhan Omar @IlhanMNWhat confusion? Normal people know this is standard for documenting evidence in a crime scene.\n\nBut it&#8217;s nice of him to drop the act and admit he kept the documents and it wasn&#8217;t planted.\n\nMaybe now his goons will stop harassing DOJ and realize he is a treasonous criminal.

        "description": "John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The late-night/early-morning hangout for Cubs fans asks if the Cubs will set another record for most players used in a season.  Welcome back to BCB After Dark: the late-night party for night owls, early risers, new parents and Cubs fans abroad. Come on in and grab a table. There are still a few left. We’re going to start the show any minute now. There’s no cover charge tonight. Tell us if there’s anything we can do to make you evening more comfortable. Bring your own beverage.\nBCB After Dark is the place for you to talk baseball, music, movies, or anything else you need to get off your chest, as long as it is within the rules of the site. The late-nighters are encouraged to get the party started, but everyone else is invited to join in as you wake up the next morning and into the afternoon.\nThe Cubs beat the Blue Jays, 7-5 tonight to salvage one game of the three games in Canada and earn the Cubs their first .500 month since May of last year. \nLast night I asked you what your favorite 2022 Cubs uniform was. It really came down to just two choices as the other three just got a handful of votes combined. But with 58 percent, you think those Cubs’ “Field of Dreams” uniforms are a winner. Another 33 percent of you picked the standard home white pinstripe uniforms. I generally don’t vote in these polls, but I think this is a sign that the Cubs should adopt some kind of alternate uniform on a regular basis with the “standing bear” logo. I don’t want it to replace the red “C,” but I would like to see it used more as an alternate look.\nHere’s the part where I talk about movies and jazz. You’re free to skip ahead to the baseball question at the end. You won’t hurt my feelings.\n\nTonight is our last night of paying tribute to the late Joey DeFrancesco, master of the Hammond organ, who left us way too early last week. I’ve got one video of him from 2003 playing the jazz standard “Misty” in his hometown Philadelphia studio with Larry Carlton on guitar, Chris Farr on saxophone, Gerald Veasley on bass and Byron Landham on drums. This one swings. \n\nAnd finally, a bonus track. I’ve played this one in the past, but it seems appropriate that I play it again here in final tribute. Here’s DeFrancesco playing “Take Me Out To The Ballgame” back in 2008.\n\n\nTonight’s film is 1959’s Jazz on a Summer’s Day, which is a documentary of one day at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival. While it isn’t the first concert film, Jazz on a Summer’s Day re-invented the genre into something that we know today. Certainly Monterey Pop and especially Woodstock owe a lot to Jazz on a Summer’s Day in the way filmmakers approach a music event. This film uses the music on the stage to document not just the musicians, but the people in the stands, the kids playing in the fields, the workers setting up and people generally just hanging around Rhode Island. (The film takes a trip to the harbor for people getting ready to watch qualifying heats for the America’s Cup yacht races while the music plays at one point.) All the while, they do this in some glorious technicolor. This is a great-looking film for a music documentary. \nDirectors Bert Stern and Aram Avakian took a very different approach because they weren’t traditional documentary film makers. While Avakian was a film editor (and huge jazz fan), Stern actually came from the world of fashion photography. (He later went on to shoot Marilyn Monroe’s final photo session for Vogue.) \nThe film was the idea of Newport Jazz Festival founder George Wein, who wanted to had wanted to capture the festival on film for years. He felt he never could because all of the artists were signed to different record labels and there were rights issues to all the music. But after meeting Stern, Stern told him to just shoot it and ask for the rights later, figuring that the artists and their labels would see the performances and then see the wisdom in letting the film come out. That strategy worked.\nStern really brought his eye for fashion and lighting to this film. Certainly he shoots the knockout hat and dress that Anita O’Day is wearing on-stage beautifully, but he also takes the time to shoot what people in the crowd are wearing or even the people backstage. That’s been a criticism of the film over the years—that the film concentrates too much on the crowd and the “event” and not enough on the music. But I think that was the right decision. The reactions of the crowd repeatedly feed back to the music on stage and vice-versa. (Probably a lot more on film than in real life, I admit.) Even watching children play in the fields while the music plays on in the background emphasizes the joy that everyone is having.\nI’d say the film had a lot of elements of a television commercial, and I mean that in a positive sense. You know how commercials try to show people having a great time and then associate their product with the joy they are all feeling? That’s what Stern and Avakian do here. Additionally, the musicians are mostly shot at a very low angle. I think that’s probably because it’s where the cameras could set up off the stage and where the lighting looked best, but it has the effect of making the musicians look larger than life. That’s good ad copy. If these men and women look like giants, that’s because they were. \nThe music in the film is very good, although with a few exceptions, it’s not exactly cutting-edge jazz even for 1958. It’s mostly mainstream stuff. But it’s being performed by some of the giants of the field. Louis Armstrong is of course the biggest name here, but there is also Thelonious Monk, Dinah Washington, Gerry Mulligan, Art Farmer, Jimmy Giuffre, Sonny Stitt, the previously-mentioned O’Day and others. In the non-jazz performances, a young Chuck Berry gets up and plays “Sweet Little Sixteen” and every essay on Jazz on a Summer’s Day mentions the performance of gospel titan Mahalia Jackson, who ends the film with a beautiful gospel music version of “The Lord’s Prayer.” \nPeople have praised Jazz on a Summer’s Day as a portrait of Eisenhower’s America. Ironically, critics have also attacked it as a portrait of Eisenhower’s America. I guess your opinion of mid-century America is going to color your interpretation of the film. Certainly there’s a very integrated stage playing for a mostly (although not completely) white audience. Personally, I thought the film was gorgeous to look at and fun to listen to. Isn’t that what we ask for out of a film?\nHere’s Anita O’Day’s performance in the film, singing “Sweet Georgia Brown” and “Tea for Two.” This is a great example of Stern’s eye for the fashion of the event. Years later, O’Day would claim to remember almost nothing of the show because she was strung out on heroin while she was performing that day. I wonder what she would have been like sober.\n\n\nWelcome back to everyone who skips the jazz and movies. Or tonight, the double dose of jazz.\nWith Brendon Little and Jeremiah Estrada making their major-league debuts in Toronto, the Cubs have used 60 players this season, which is just shy of the major-league record of 69 players used by the (checks article) 2021 Cubs. The Cubs have 31 games left this season and need to have ten more players make their season debut with the Cubs to break their own record.\nTonight’s question is simple. Will the Cubs use 70 players this year? The rosters expand to 28 players on September 1, so that opens up the possibility for two more players to make their debut on Friday. They could bring back someone who’s already played for the team, of course.\nSo will the Cubs roster hit 70 players for 2022?\n\nThank you for joining us this week and digging the music. We hope we’ve made your week a little more pleasant. I hope you join us again next week and bring some friends. Get home safely. Tip your waitstaff. And we’ll see you next week for another set of shows at BCB After Dark.",

        "description": "George Monbiot criticised ‘chefs and foodies’ like me for focusing on regenerative grazing. But alternative, lab-grown foods, could have terrible consequencesI have huge admiration for George Monbiot, a columnist of this newspaper. His work has highlighted the urgent need to reduce our CO2 emissions and switch to greener energy. He has also shown intensive farming’s role in the dramatic levels of species decline and biodiversity loss. Much of what he writes I wholeheartedly agree with – but when it comes to the solutions we need to change our farming and food systems, we have radically different takes.It is indisputable that the farming “revolution” of the 1950s, with its widespread use of ammonia fertilisers and herbicides, pesticides and fungicides, has waged war on nature. These intensive, monocultural ways of producing food are not only contaminating our land and waterways, but are heating up our planet and contributing to a crisis in human health (more people die of diet-related disease globally than smoking, according to a study published in the Lancet). The animals in factory farms don’t have a great time either. The decline of insect life is incredibly worrying: without the earthworm, beetle and bee, life as we know it could cease. Topsoils, which we use to grow 95% of the world’s food, are depleting at an astonishing rate. We need to change the way we eat and produce food, and we need to do it quickly.Thomasina Miers is a cook, writer and restaurateurDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "description": "FanGraphs\n    \n\n  Land ho! South Siders snap five-game skid; are “back,” according to some Look at these happy, smiling boys! Based on the image below, you’d NEVER guess that they’ve spent most of the season compelled to watch the 2022 White Sox, who picked up the first win of the 2022 Miguel Cairo era — how long it may last, nobody knows — with a 4-1 win over the Royals on Wednesday. \n  \n        \n  \nSome had a good night, some had a great night, some had entirely unremarkable nights. Let’s find out who’s who!\n\nThe Starters\nLance Lynn’s season is finally rounding into form — and just in the nick of time, too! \nJokes aside, Lynn posted what might have been his most impressive outing of his abbreviated 2022, working through seven innings for the first time this season and allowing just a single earned run on four hits in the process. Lynn tied his season-high with eight punchies, the fifth time he’s reached that mark this year, and he walked none, making it nine straight starts with zero or one walk. Though his four-seamer is still far flatter than he’d like — the 20 inches of vertical movement he averaged tonight was more like 14 or 15 last year, where a lower number means more “rise” — his cutter, sinker, and curveball compensated magnificently, and he spotted them excellently, generating a mix of whiffs, called strikes, and weak contact that kept the Royals offense at bay for the night.\nSince giving up 19 earned runs over 14 innings between July 6 to 16, Lynn has registered a 2.61 ERA (48 1⁄3 IP, 14 ER) over nine starts, striking out 56 and walking a puny five during that time. His 2.6% walk rate is the second-lowest in the majors in that span behind Corey Kluber.\nLynn’s 91-pitch outing looked like this: \n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \nMany things in life are beyond our comprehension as human beings, and one particular item that lies beyond mine is how Kris Bubic continues to churn out quality starts against the White Sox at a nearly 100% rate. After working six two-run innings tonight, Bubic has allowed two or fewer runs in eight of his nine career appearances the White Sox, pitching into the sixth inning in every single one of them. For his career, Bubic now has a 2.70 lifetime ERA in 16 combined appearances totaling 88 innings against the White Sox and Tigers ... and a 5.70 ERA in 197 innings against everyone else. His stuff was not particularly sharp tonight, generating just 10 total swings-and-misses on his three-pitch mix, but as has been the rule in 2022, he managed to leverage the Sox aggressiveness against them, using their tendency to take themselves out of at-bats early in the count to generate bad contact and generally work his way out of the trouble caused by allowing six hits and four walks in just 94 pitches. \nThose 94 pitches? They looked like this:\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \n\nPressure Play\nYasmani Grandal’s first plate appearance off of the injured list wound up being the highest pressure of the game, arriving with the bases loaded and no outs in the second inning with a 2.85 LI. He flew out to right field.\n\nPressure Cooker\nHunter Dozier responded to the biggest pressure-load of the game (1.34 pLI) by going 0-for-4 with three strikeouts. \n\nTop Play\nElvis entered the building, and the ball soon left the building. Andrus’s fifth-inning dinger to break a 1-1 tie added .157 WPA to the Sox chances at victory, the most of the night.\n\n\nTop Performer\nLance Lynn’s  .310 WPA easily paced both sides, and deservedly so. \n\n\nSmackdown\nHardest hit: Checking in at 107.5 mph, Bobby Witt The Younger’s fourth inning solo home run was the hardest-hit ball of the game.\n\n\nWeakest contact: Romy González extended an ultimately game-winning rally in the seventh inning by reaching base on a 41.3 mph tapper that was the slowest batted ball of the night. \n\nLuckiest hit: Josh Harrison’s seeing-eye single in the eighth inning had an xBA of just .160. \n\nToughest out: Nicky Lopez is the king of misfortune for the second straight night, this time as a result of sending a line drive with a .770 xBA directly at second baseman Romy González.\n\nLongest hit: Another win for Witt, whose 431-foot blast was the longest shot of the game. \n\nMagic Number: .667\nWith a win percentage of nearly 67% (2-1), Miguel Cairo is, for tonight, the winningest manager in White Sox history, moving ahead of Sox managerial luminaries Ed Walsh, Don Cooper, and Doug Rader on the team’s all-time win chart.\n\nGlossary\nHard-hit is any ball off the bat at 95 mph or moreLI measures pressure per playpLI measures total pressure faced in-gameWhiff a swing-and-missWPA win probability added measures contributions to the winxBA expected batting average",

        "description": "BikePark Wales offers the UK’s longest beginner trail – 5km – and a great introduction to downhill mountain biking. Our writer and her family try it outThe Vicious Valley trail starts with a terrifying half-metre drop off a wooden boardwalk. Like all the advanced runs at BikePark Wales in the Brecon Beacons national park, it begins with a qualifier, that is a tricky opening feature where you can check whether you’re good enough for the trail and, if not, bail out in favour of an easier alternative.At the urging of my sons, who are nine and 11, Harry Lewis, one of our two guides, executes a perfect demonstration of how to ride the drop. Namely by jumping off as high as he can. The kids whoop; my husband raises an eyebrow. Then to our great relief, Harry leads us to the new Kermit trail, designed to provide an altogether less intimidating introduction to downhill mountain biking (though at 5km it’s the UK’s longest beginner trail).

Jordan Luplow’s 2-run homer started a 4-run 1st inning for the Aces, who comfortably cruised to a win. Dominic Canzone and Dominic Miroglio added RBI singles. The Aviators’ only run came on a Matt Davidson solo home run against Tyler Holton.\nAA: Amarillo Sod Poodles 10, Frisco RoughRiders 16; 59-62\nBox Score\nRoss Carver got tagged for 5 runs in the top of the 4th, finishing with 6 runs in 3+ innings and 4 home runs on a day the wind was blowing out. Jorge Barrosa had 3 hits, including his 12th home run in Amarillo, from the leadoff spot and Jordan Lawlar socked his first AA home run. The Amarillo bullpen had a rough night, with the RoughRiders scoring three times in each of the final three innings to blow an 8-7 lead.\nHigh-A: Hillsboro Hops 6, Tri-City Dust Devils 3; 55-65\nBox Score\nChad Patrick held the Dust Devils to 3 runs (2 earned) in 5 innings with 9 strikeouts. His solid start combined with early offense allowed the Hops to win comfortably. Deyvison De Los Santos had two hits, a double, an RBI, and a run scored. A.J. Vukovich singled and scored in 4 trips to the plate.\nLow-A: Visalia Rawhide 11, Lake Elsinore Storm 12; 40-82\nBox Score\nDylan Ray had a rough first inning, allowing 5 runs on 2 home runs. The bullpen allowed the deficit to swell to 8-0 before Visalia scored 3 runs in the 5th. The deficit grew too big for a late rally to overcome, as Visalia scored 8 runs in their final 2 at-bats. First baseman Ivan Melendez singled and walked in 6 trips to the plate, his first game since August 24th. Joshua Day had 2 hits, 2 walks, 3 RBI, and 2 runs scored out of the #2 spot in the order.",

There is the warrior prince, Alexander Nevsky, who fought off the Swedes and the Teutonic knights. There are contrasting portraits of Ivan the Terrible, one proud and mistrustful, the other of a deranged monarch cradling the son he killed. And there are the grand 18th-century sovereigns Peter the Great and Empress Catherine. Continue reading...",

        "description": "The Vampire Diaries’s Kat Graham and Umbrella Academy’s Tom Hopper star in a passable, if not particularly sizzling, rom-com set in VeronaThe Netflix confection Love in the Villa invokes two well-established traditions. There’s the general rom-com formula – two characters at odds, a meet-cute, a deception/reveal, an epiphany, a repeated inside joke, someone running somewhere in a time crunch. And then there’s the manufactured flavors of Netflix comfort food: recognizable B-to-C-list talent, cheesy locale, banal Twitter-inflected jokes, distinctively cheap-looking production, passable but not particularly invigorating chemistry. Written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, Love in the Villa combines both into another ephemeral confection off the streaming assembly line – inoffensive and baseline pleasurable yet immediately forgettable.The hook here is that the central couple, played by The Vampire Diaries’s Kat Graham and Umbrella Academy’s Tom Hopper, meet in picturesque Verona – as corny a romantic location as it gets but excellent eye candy during the twilight of a summer in which seemingly every celebrity visited Italy. Verona is, of course, the setting of Romeo and Juliet or, as Graham’s Julie tells her classroom of third-grade students, “the most romantic and tragic love story of all time”. True to form, Julie is a hopeless overachieving romantic dialed up to 11 – she dreams of seeing Juliet’s balcony in Verona, she laminates her travel plans and designates 7% of vacation time for “spontaneity”.

        "description": "In this deeply satisfying novel, a sacred rock provides the fulcrum for four loosely connected stories exploring ancient ritual and healingJust off the Pacific coast of Mexico, at San Blas in Nayarit, the White Rock juts up out of the sea. For the Wixárika people, who call it Tatéi Haramara or Mother Ocean, it is a sacred place. According to Wixárika cosmogony, when time began and there was nothing but boiling water covering the earth, the rock was the first solid object to be born and the origin of all life. For thousands of years the Wixárika have made pilgrimages to the site to offer sacrifices and to give thanks.In Anna Hope’s fourth novel, The White Rock, this hallowed place is the fulcrum for four loosely connected narratives. Opening in 2020 with the story of a British writer whose faith in the future, both personally and globally, is crumbling, the book travels backwards in time, first to the 1960s and a burned-out American rock star running from fame and the Feds, and then to the first decade of the 20th century as two sisters from the persecuted Yoeme tribe are seized from their mountain village and shipped south to be sold as slaves. Hope’s fourth story chronicles the breakdown in 1775 of a Spanish naval lieutenant as he prepares to sail north on a mission to map the coast of California and claim new territories for his king. Like an inverted version of David Mitchell’s Cloud Atlas, the narrative then arcs around, retracing its steps through each story on its way back to the writer’s present tense. Continue reading...",

She set about building a team to beef up the multibillion dollar meditation app&#x2019;s bonafides, hiring researchers from Harvard, Brown, and other prestigious institutions.\nA year later, Huberty has departed the company to strike out on her own as a scientific consultant for digital health companies, and the future of her science team and the company&#x2019;s broader research efforts is unclear. Two members of the staff Huberty hired have indicated on social media that they are looking for new jobs, and links to the team&#x2019;s biographies have been removed from the Calm Science website. The disruption at Calm Science follows a shakeup at the company, which laid off&#xA0; about 20% of its staff in August, less than a month after Calm&#x2019;s founders stepped back and a new CEO was named.Continue to STAT+ to read the full story&hellip;",

He said he noted how the world’s first civilian nuclear power station was built in Cumbria.I look back at the optimism in the pages of that book and I look at what has happened since and at the short-termism of successive British governments and their failure to do justice to our pioneering nuclear history … and I feel like one of those beautifully drawn illustrations of that Ladybird book of what happens in a nuclear pile.The graphite rods are taken out at the wrong moments and my blood starts to boil and steam starts coming out of my ears and I think I’m going to meltdown. I ask myself the question: ‘What happened to us?’. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Monarda Thrasher loved Mixed Precipitation’s traveling production of “The Magic Flute” when they saw it earlier this month in Grand Marais, and they highly recommend this fun, modern take on Mozart’s opera.Mixed Precipitation calls its traveling series “The Pickup Truck Opera” because the truck and trailer are both the mode of travel and part of the set design. Set in Strange Land Middle School, this production explores teacher shortages, burnout and toxic positivity. Papageno and Papagena are janitors, and the raging Queen of the Night is recast as an education administrator.The dialogue is in English, and performers slip easily from German arias to pop songs and back again. As an opera lover, Thrasher worried that this shortened production might leave them wanting more, but they said there was enough of the original music to satisfy, danced and sung in a way that kept their whole family entertained.The outdoor production takes place Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m. at Alexis Bailly Vineyard in Hastings, as well as Sept. 10 at Swede Hollow Park in St. Paul and Sept. 11 at JD Rivers’ Children’s Garden in Minneapolis.Minneapolis comedian Robert Fones plans to spend his Labor Day weekend at Prairie Fyre music festival in Wood Lake in southwestern Minnesota. The camping/music festival runs Friday evening through Monday, with a line-up of over 50 bands and performers. Fones says the space that will hold the event is beautiful, and he’s intrigued by the line-up of music, burlesque, comedy, and poetry.Festival attendees can also join in on glitch art workshops Saturday and Sunday mornings in nearby Granite Falls and get back in time for the musical events that start at 2 pm. Friday evening’s opening event features a Q&amp;A with comic book author Rob Sheridan, who is best known for his art work with Nine Inch Nails.Will Dykes of the band Montclair really enjoys the sound of the Rat Castle Jazz Ensemble. He says the Minneapolis group has a unique sound that doesn’t pander and they collaborate and connect with other local bands.You can find the Rat Castle Jazz Ensemble’s work on all streaming platforms as well performing across the Twin Cities.Here they are at the White Squirrel bar in St. Paul:",

The program could offer various exclusive perks, discounts, and other enticements for \tsubscribers to spend more money on Disney products and services. A secondary benefit would be allowing the company to collect more information on customers’ tastes and habits, improving its ability to cross-sell across its various businesses — from streaming services to theme parks to merchandise. \nAccording to the WSJ, discussion of the membership program is very much in its early stages. It’s not clear what segments of Disney’s audience it would target, how much it would cost, or when the program might launch. Internally, some...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

New York Daily News | Kristie Ackert: While there still have been some annoying games mixed in, the Yankees’ offense has shown some signs of life recently. The way the Yankees see it, the struggles have come in part from injuries and in part from a general domino effect related back to some big bats being out of the lineup. Either way, they’re still trying to battle through it and get back on track.\nNew York Post | Justin Tasch: In recent weeks, the Yankees have made some depth additions  with bullpen pieces, and it appears they made another on Wednesday. The Yankees reportedly signed Tyler Duffey to a minor league deal after he opted out of one with the Rangers. Duffey last pitched in the majors earlier this season with the Twins, but struggled, leading to his release and eventual minor league stint with Texas. In general, Duffey is an eight-year MLB veteran, who has had some good years in the past.\nMLB.com: Last week, we saw the release of the 2023 regular season schedule, and now we have an additional piece to the puzzle as the spring training schedule was released on Wednesday. The Yankees are set to open with a road game against the Phillies on February 25th, and then host the Braves in their first home game the following day.\nAssociated Press | Andrew Dampf: The Yankees have added to their sporting ownership portfolio by purchasing a 10 percent stake in Italian soccer club AC Milan. This adds to the stake that Yankees Global Enterprises has in New York City FC of MLS, who currently play in Yankee Stadium. Milan are one of the giants of Italian and European soccer, having won Italy’s Serie A 19 times, including the 2021-22 title, and have seven times been crowned European champions.\nIn some hopefully positive injury news, Luis Severino is apparently about to begin a rehab stint:\n\n\nPer Boone… Luis Severino will start Friday with the @TampaTarpons #yankees— Meredith Marakovits (@M_Marakovits) August 31, 2022",

        "description": "The U.S. is on the verge of taking a significant step backwards in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Amid the rollout of the new bivalent boosters this winter, the government is due to run out of funds for vaccines and therapeutics. President Joe Biden’s administration has been shuffling money from other pockets to pay for the new shots after Congress failed to pass a pandemic budget request earlier this summer. The government will soon run out of options. This will result in a significant shift in how we fight the pandemic—what is being referred to as “commercialization.” The public has yet to wrap their minds around the implications, and while it seems unlikely that we’ll avoid this fate, there are strategies to lessen the worst potential impacts.Commercialization is a rather bland-sounding term that means that COVID treatments and vaccines would be handled just like everything else in our health-care system. Instead of no-cost access to vaccines and therapies, drug companies and insurers will decide how much to charge for products such as Paxlovid. Americans who are insured could begin to see co-payments and deductibles, and may even need prior approvals from insurance companies to get access to highly effective drugs that combat the effects of COVID-19. For those without insurance, many of whom are in jobs where they are most exposed to the virus, access would likely be much more strained and could disappear entirely.​​[Read: America is zooming through the pandemic panic-neglect cycle]Some might ask, What’s the worry? This is, after all, how the rest of the U.S. health-care system functions. Many Americans would take issue with the assertion that the system serves them well, but setting that aside, commercialization is an even bigger challenge with COVID-19. It is a still unpredictable and mutating infectious disease with already low vaccination rates, so the effects of this change could prolong the length and severity of the pandemic.The one sure way to fix this—Congress acting on the Biden administration’s $22.5 billion budget request to fight the pandemic—seems more and more remote. Democrats couldn’t get it done with a bare majority in Congress, and Congress is likely to get less Democratic, not more, after the midterms. The administration must formulate a Plan B.Much of Plan B falls right on two groups that the public has an equal or even lower trust in than Congress—pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies, as well as state governments, several with a notably spotty record of supporting people during the pandemic.The public is right to be wary. Historically, when the pharmaceutical industry has complete pricing power and limited competition, companies haven’t been afraid to charge maximally for their medicine. These products can run into the thousands of dollars per treatment. Those costs are likely to go even higher when your local insurance provider, not the U.S. government, is negotiating the deal. Should that happen, insurers are likely to respond by taking steps to limit utilization, often by “tiering” the drug on their formulary as one with a high patient co-pay, or by employing other mechanisms to defray their costs or discourage use. And if you are uninsured or can’t afford your medication, there are some programs to help you, but unequal access mostly means that if you can’t afford it, you don’t get it.And the threshold is low. Studies have shown that even a $10 co-payment is enough to discourage large numbers of people from receiving their medicine. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that even if a vaccine is free, if it’s not easily accessible where people live or work, vaccination rates drop off significantly. This can lead to a spike in cases and severe illness—particularly among uninsured, undocumented, and low-income people. And this affects everyone. Wherever SARS-CoV-2 can find pockets to grow, it will, and the more it spreads, the more likely it is to mutate.Commercialization causes other problems. Today the U.S. has been competing globally for allocation of drugs and vaccines. Acting as a nation has allowed U.S. citizens access to new vaccines and therapies as soon as they come on the market. Commercialization would yield dozens of small entities competing with one another and the rest of the world for access to new vaccines or treatments. Let’s say we face a situation where the virus evolves to evade our current technology (as happened when new variants rendered several of our monoclonal-antibody therapies ineffective). In the time it takes to scale up a new drug or a needed innovation such as a universal or nasal vaccine, the U.S. would be less able to compete for supply with other countries—all of whom buy on behalf of their entire country. The difference between being able to access the vaccine when it first comes to market versus waiting for production to fully ramp up could mean hundreds of thousands of lives. Once again, the poor will suffer most during these shortages as the rich turn to hoarding and black markets.[Andy Slavitt: The three COVID developments I am still holding out hope for]A New Plan BTo avoid these outcomes, the Biden administration should propose that drug companies and insurers enter into a four-part grand bargain—one that serves the public, accounts for the inequities inherent in commercialization, and keeps the country on advantageous footing with the rest of the world. They can do this even while continuing to profit from their investment in vaccines and therapies.No barriers to access. Insurers must agree to make vaccines and treatments available with $0 cost sharing and no utilization review to get access to a drug. Therapies such as Paxlovid generally need to be given within five days of onset, so a prescription from a doctor should be all that is needed to qualify. This is helped out to some degree by provisions in the Affordable Care Act that require vaccines to be provided to anyone with private insurance without co-payments or coinsurance. Therapies are covered very differently. Consumers with private insurance face tiered benefits, which tend to increase payments with the expense of the drug. Medicare has a different set of rules that vary depending on whether the drug is administered in an office (as is a monoclonal antibody) or bought in a pharmacy (as Paxlovid is). Insurers should agree to treat therapies the same way vaccines are treated: covered without out-of-pocket costs that could discourage people from getting the care they need to prevent serious illness or an expensive hospitalization.No price gouging. Pharmaceutical companies should agree to sell COVID-19 treatments to states, territories, tribes, localities, insurance companies, and employers at the same price they provide them to the U.S. government today. Why would they do that? Because with this agreement for all insurers to keep supplying these biopharmaceuticals and keep cost sharing at zero, the manufacturers can be assured of as large a market as they have today. Insurance companies will point out that paying for these vaccines and therapies will increase premiums for everybody, so any price gouging will fall back on the public.The uninsured should be treated the same as the insured. The current vaccination strategy doesn’t require proof of insurance or proof of documentation (undocumented immigrants are five times more likely to be uninsured). But once commercialization goes into effect, who looks out for the uninsured? We do have mechanisms to reimburse for some uninsured care. They are a hodgepodge of antiquated approaches, but we need to pull them all out. Pharmaceutical companies should agree to provide free vaccines to anyone who visits a pharmacy and who qualifies financially; many pharmaceutical companies have programs like this already, but they aren’t as easily available. Federally Qualified Health Centers, a community hub of care for low-income and uninsured people, and other community-safety-net providers should be able to purchase COVID-19 treatments and therapies at a reduced cost through the 340B program or at the lower price that low- and middle-income countries pay for their therapies and vaccines, and provide them to the uninsured without cost sharing. No one should be turned away from getting a vaccine or treatment.Secure access to future innovation. The last big piece of the puzzle is to lock in a strategy for securing access to continued global supply of the next generation of vaccines and therapies. This requires the U.S. government to act, in effect, as a global purchasing agent for the country to negotiate an overall price and allocation on behalf of everyone, no matter their insurance status or who ultimately provides them their vaccines or treatments.Congress could still act during the lame-duck session. But if they don’t, the four measures outlined here are broadly consistent with how Americans want their health-care system to work, according to research by United States of Care. Such an agreement would still leave plenty to be desired. People will fall through the cracks. The Biden administration has been able to orchestrate an orderly allocation process to pharmacies, federal sites, clinician offices, tribal nations, and territories. That would be replaced by a free-for-all with very uneven outcomes based on a series of closed-door, private-market relationships. But we cannot let perfect be the enemy of good.Americans may look back on their brief experience with health care that more closely resembles a system much of the rest of the world enjoys—one where the federal government steps in so that everyone pays less, and where access is shared as equitably as possible—and demand bigger changes, such as true universal health care. Congress’s inaction now just may provide that spark.",

The three phones are focused on Europe, and are distinct from the range of devices that HMD sells in the US. \nAs well as being sold outright, the Nokia X30 5G will be one of a handful of phones available via HMD’s new subscription service called “Circular,” where customers can subscribe to get a handset for a monthly fee and receive incentives to use a phone for as long as possible. Circular will initially be available in the UK and Germany, but HMD says it’s planning a global launch “in the coming months.” \nHMD justifies its eco-friendly claims about the Nokia X30 5G with...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "Photo by John Cordes/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  August is finally over, but the pressure is far from gone. The Yankees have been drifting off of their once-historic win pace for a while now, but August ... August sucked. This was the team’s worst month since the finale of the 1991 season, a year where the Yankees were already known to be bad and simply finished the year off terrible. This year’s team was approaching greatness, and now they simply aren’t. The month may be done with, but it’ll take a lot more than turning the calendar to snap this team out of their funk. Given that the division lead is down to just six games suddenly, let’s hope it happens sooner rather than later.\nAfter the latest Aaron Judge tracking, Andrew catches you up on how the division lead got trimmed again in today’s rivalry roundup. John has a two-for-one special, first bringing this month’s Cashman poll (brace for impact there) and later arguing that the team may need to re-invest in the opener thanks to their lack of starting depth. Peter dives into the trio of journeyman pitchers the Yankees added on minor league deals recently, and Andrés examines how Jonathan Loáisiga has righted his own ship.\nToday’s Matchup:\nOff-day\nFun Questions:\n  1. Where does Jonathan Loáisiga fall in the circle of trust right now?\n  2. Will the division race that’s currently materializing out of thin air last long or will the Yankees get it back under wraps?",

        "description": "“How to Build a Life” is a weekly column by Arthur Brooks, tackling questions of meaning and happiness. Click here to listen to his podcast series on all things happiness, How to Build a Happy Life.If you are a parent, your greatest fear in life is likely something happening to one of your kids. According to one 2018 poll from OnePoll and the Lice Clinics of America (not my usual data source, but no one else seems to measure this), parents spend an average of 37 hours a week worrying about their children; the No. 1 back-to-school concern is about their safety. And this makes sense, if you believe that safety is a foundation that has to be established before dealing with other concerns.You can see the effects of all this worrying in modern parenting behavior. According to a 2015 report from the Pew Research Center, on average, parents say children should be at least 10 years old to play unsupervised in their own front yard, 12 years old to stay home alone for an hour, and 14 to be unsupervised at a public park. It also shows up in what parents teach their kids about the world: Writing in The Journal of Positive Psychology in 2021, the psychologists Jeremy D. W. Clifton and Peter Meindl found that 53 percent of respondents preferred “dangerous world” beliefs for their children.No doubt these beliefs come from the best of intentions. If you want children to be safe (and thus, happy), you should teach them that the world is dangerous—that way, they will be more vigilant and careful. But in fact, teaching them that the world is dangerous is bad for their health, happiness, and success.Want to stay current with Arthur’s writing? Sign up to get an email every time a new column comes out.The contention that the world is mostly safe or mostly dangerous is what some psychologists call a “primal world belief,” one about life’s basic essence. Specifically, it’s a negative primal in which the fundamental character of the world is assumed to be threatening. Primal beliefs are different from more specific beliefs—say, about sports or politics—insofar as they color our whole worldview. If I believe that the Red Sox are a great baseball team, it generally will not affect my unrelated attitudes and decisions. But according to Clifton and Meindl, if I believe that the world is dangerous, it will affect the way I see many other parts of my life, relationships, and work. I will be more suspicious of other people’s motives, for example, and less likely to do things that might put me or my loved ones in harm’s way, such as going out at night.As much as we hope the dangerous-world belief will help our kids, the evidence indicates that it does exactly the opposite. In the same paper, Clifton and Meindl show that people holding negative primals are less healthy than their peers, more often sad, more likely to be depressed, and less satisfied with their lives. They also tend to dislike their jobs and perform worse than their more positive counterparts. One explanation for this is that people under bad circumstances (poverty, illness, etc.) have both bad outcomes and a lot to fear. However, as Clifton and Meindl argue, primals can also interact with life outcomes—you likely suffer a lot more when you are always looking for danger and avoiding risk.[Read: Telling the difference between danger and fear]Teaching your kids that the world is dangerous can also make them less tolerant of others. In one 2018 study, researchers subjected a sample of adults to a measure called the “Belief in a Dangerous World Scale,” which asked them to agree or disagree with statements such as “Any day now chaos and anarchy could erupt around us” and “There are many dangerous people in our society who will attack someone out of pure meanness, for no reason at all.” They found that people scoring high on this scale also showed heightened prejudice and hostility toward groups such as undocumented immigrants, whom they stereotypically considered a threat to their safety. This study was conducted among adults, but it is easy to see how these attitudes would migrate to their kids.This is similar to the argument made by the writers Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt in The Atlantic in 2015, and in their subsequent book, The Coddling of the American Mind. Lukianoff and Haidt contend that when parents (or professors) teach young people that ordinary interactions are dangerous—for example, that speech is a form of violence—it hinders their intellectual and emotional growth. It also leads them to adopt black-and-white views (for example, that the world is made up of people who are either good or evil), and makes them more anxious in the face of minor stressors such as political disagreement.[From the September 2015 issue: The coddling of the American mind]And to top it all off, negative primals don’t even help keep people safe. Researchers writing in the journal Psychology &amp; Health in 2001 showed that a general state of fear can actually make a person less likely to take threats seriously (a self-defense mechanism to control our fear) and undermine precautionary behavior (by degrading the ability to address danger rationally).It is not in young people’s interest that we instill in them negative primals. In so doing, we might harm them by making them less happy, less healthy, and more bigoted toward others. To break this pattern, parents—and anyone who interacts with children—should instead work to cultivate a sense of safety. Here are three rules to help you get started.1. Heal thyself.Parents might feed their kids negative primals because they hold such views themselves. This is easy to do in a world where we are bombarded with news and information, which studies have linked to distress, anxiety, and depression—even when the news is not specifically negative. And research shows that many parents pass on their anxiety to their children.One way to allay our own fears is simply to look at the facts. As the journalist Christopher Ingraham has written, being a kid in America has never been safer. Since 1935, the number of childhood deaths between the ages of 1 and 4 fell from 450 to 30 per 100,000. It has fallen by nearly half just since 1990, and the decreases in other age groups are similarly impressive. Use this knowledge to counteract the media’s relentless focus on fear and danger. You might even print out a chart on declining childhood mortality (such as the one linked above) and put it on the fridge as a reminder of how good your kids have it.[Read: The magic of a little danger]2. Be specific and proportional.Grown-ups want to teach young people how to stay safe in the face of threats. However, the research is clear that a blanket attitude of fear can actually make them less able to do so. If you want to offer a child a warning to make them better prepared, focus on one specific danger they might face and how to deal with it. Instead of saying, “People will try to take advantage of you at college,” say, “If someone is trying to get you to drink too much, avoid that person.”When you do need to bring up a threat, make sure you keep it in proportion. For example, I don’t want anyone to be mean to my kids any more than the next parent. They know this. But it doesn’t help them for me to say that hostile words inherently make them unsafe. Social conflict is unavoidable, and making them fear it as an existential threat amounts to giving them a negative primal, rendering them less resilient.[From the April 2014 issue: The overprotected kid]3. Counteract negative primals from outside.Almost every day that my daughter was in high school, she was taught about the dangerous world—about bad people, dangerous forces in nature, and a bleak future for our country. She told us about the gloom and doom each evening at dinner, and my wife and I could see her growing pessimism. So we set about deliberately countering the scary narrative. We didn’t sugarcoat the threats; we simply tried to be specific about the kind behaviors we witnessed, and ways that the world was safer and more prosperous today than in the past. It was our way of sharing our genuine belief that on the whole, most people are good and things are getting better.Working hard to avoid instilling a fear-based primal belief in kids is good. But really, we should all be able to do better than that, and try to cultivate a positive primal belief that can truly improve their lives. For that, I turn to the words of the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu. “Through Love, one has no fear,” he wrote in the Tao Te Ching.[Read: Love is medicine for fear]Instead of teaching our kids fear primals, let’s teach them love primals, which neutralize fear and put something good in its place. Let them know that people are made for love—we all crave it, and we can find something lovable in just about everyone we meet. We don’t always give it or accept it, because we make a lot of mistakes, but love is what all our hearts desire. If you want to give your children a rule to live by, this one is a much safer bet.​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission. Thank you for supporting The Atlantic.",

        "description": "James Choi, a professor at Yale University, was interested in teaching a different kind of personal-finance course. He wanted his curriculum to mix the conclusions of technical economics papers with the takeaways from glitzy best-selling books.Several years ago, he started poring over dozens of popular personal-finance titles, which had sold tens of millions of copies, in order to get a sense of the counsel they were dispensing. “I got really interested in this universe of advice and how was it different from the advice that we academics were giving about savings and investment,” he told me. He realized that the most popular books tended to offer finance tips that were either significantly different from academic research or, in his words, “just dead wrong.”Choi distilled 50 best sellers’ lessons in saving, spending, and investing and lined them up against the takeaways of mainstream economics research. This month, he published the results in a new paper: “Popular Personal Financial Advice Versus the Professors.” His conclusion: Economists tend to offer more rational advice, because they are dealing with numbers; best sellers tend to offer more practical advice, because they are grappling with human behavior—with all of its mess and irrationality.Perhaps the starkest example of the difference between economists and popular authors was the advice for paying down debt. In economic theory, Choi said, households should always focus on prioritizing the payment of their highest-interest debt. Every other strategy is more expensive, since you’re just letting higher-interest charges linger on your monthly bill.[Read: I made one simple financial change and it lowered my spending]But popular authors such as Dave Ramsey have suggested a nearly opposite approach. According to Ramsey’s “debt-snowball” method, you should pay off debt from smallest to largest, gaining motivation and momentum as you zero out your accounts. This is far from the cheapest strategy for eliminating debt—Ramsey admits as much. But his debt-snowball method isn’t about technical efficiency. It’s about building willpower. When people overwhelmed by their debt see a smaller account hit zero, it’s so rewarding that they’re motivated to continue paying down their larger balances.Choi emphasized that he doesn’t necessarily think Ramsey’s approach is strategically wrong, even though it is technically fallacious: “I think of it like diet and exercise. You can tell people to eat broccoli and steamed chicken for their whole life. Or you can tell people about cheat meals to get their buy-in so that they’re motivated to stay on the diet.”The best sellers’ emphasis on building momentum and motivation sometimes tips into less reasonable suggestions. For example, popular books frequently insist that people should save at least 10 percent of their income no matter what. You can think of this strategy as “smoothing” your savings rate: Rain or shine, you’re advised to stock away a consistent share of income to build a savings habit over time.But life isn’t smooth. It’s spiky. Many people who barely earn enough to afford rent at 25 become rich enough to easily afford a suburban home at 40. Some parents deluged with day-care expenses find a huge chunk of cash freed up when their kids move on to public school. For this reason, Choi said, academics are more likely to defend low or even negative savings rates for young people in anticipation of higher savings rates in midlife. This is the opposite of smoothing your savings rate; it’s consumption smoothing.[Read: The internet is just investment banking now]These methods are more than competing personal-finance strategies; they’re almost like competing life philosophies. Smoothing your savings pays homage to a psychological reality: Habits require discipline and practice. If most people are bad at suddenly changing their savings behavior in middle age, then advising them to sacrifice while they’re young is reasonable.But consumption smoothing pays homage to an existential reality: Life itself is the ultimate scarce asset. The future is unknowable, and religiously maintaining a double-digit savings rate through the worst squalls of life is not of the utmost importance. Having that special dinner with friends at 23 is, for instance, more valuable than having a couple hundred extra dollars in your retirement fund at 73. By this logic, building a budget that makes you comfortable and happy in the short term, even if that means varying your savings rate from decade to decade (or year to year), is the better approach.This might be the deepest takeaway of Choi’s paper. Personal-finance best sellers succeed by blending theory and psychology in a way that takes human nature seriously and thus deserves the respect of economics professors. But those who spend a lifetime delaying gratification may one day find themselves rich in savings but poor in memories, having sacrificed too much joy at the altar of compounding interest.Perhaps many of the most popular personal-finance books could take a page from economic theory: There is more to life than optimized savings habits.",

        "description": "The controversialist is in a reflective mood as he examines his parents’ troubled relationship and the failures of his first marriage“The dynamic of marital power,” AN Wilson writes, “is one of the most fascinating of all subjects.” His memoir has many stories to tell: about Oxford, Grub Street, meetings with royals, tweed suits, Tolkien-olatry, religious muddle (as “a practising Anglican with periodic waves of Doubt or Roman fever”), travels to Israel and Russia, anorexia (his own and his mother’s), social drinking “on a positively Slavic scale”, near misses at becoming a painter or priest, and a career as a novelist, biographer and literary editor. But the main strand is the power dynamics within his and his parents’ marriages. Theirs happened late and lasted till his father died; his – to the Shakespeare scholar Katherine Duncan-Jones – was precipitate and briefer. Neither union was happy. But as Wilson explores what it means to live “untogether” with someone, his tone is affectionate and forgiving.He’s less forgiving of himself. Looking back on the young AN – “so thrustingly ambitious, so full of himself, so unfaithful, not only to his wife but to his own better nature” – he’s bemused and ashamed, as if watching AN Other. His book is a mea culpa, a self-appraisal so damning (“writings not so good, deeds not so virtuous”) that it becomes almost endearing. Enough contrition, you want to tell him, you’re not so wicked a chap as you make out. Continue reading...",

        "description": "From chilling out in Lübeck to climbing Norwegian mountains, our tipsters are delighted with their high season escapades. Scroll to the bottom for the winning tipWe visited the low-rise, one-village island of Hrísey during our round-Iceland tour. It sits in the Arctic-facing inlet of Eyjafjördur, 20 minutes by ferry from Árskógssandur, north of Akureyri – the fourth largest town in Iceland. We wrapped up well for the crossing, before following a 6km trail around the south of the island. There was a warm welcome from the islanders we met, but the birds were the star attraction. Ptarmigans thrive here at sea level – they seemed almost tame. We encountered fascinating history too: fish-drying racks, antique tractors and the wonderfully named Shark-Jörundur house, built in 1885-86 using timber from Norwegian ships that ran ashore at Hrísey in 1884. We gained such a sense of the old way of life here. Paul Gamble Continue reading...",

We can sense the frosty contempt of the fiftysomething male at the desk when we ask for a double, not a twin room. After we check in, we’re both tetchy: I’m annoyed at how we’ve been treated, while my partner believes we should just “accept” it, that “it’s just the way it is.”Back then, there was little you could do about such blatant prejudice – at least on a day-to-day basis. Some respite could be found trawling through the listings in Gay Times for gay-owned hotels and B&amp;Bs. But, sadly, travel has long remained an issue for LGBTQ+ people, whether in the UK or abroad, where customs, legality and local cultural norms still need to be considered. Continue reading...",

        "description": "The American West is experiencing its driest period in human history, a megadrought that threatens health, agriculture and entire ways of life. DRIED UP is examining the dire effects of the drought on the states most affected — as well as the solutions Americans are embracing.\n\n\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — As the Western U.S. suffers under its worst drought in a millennium, the government of Texas, a state that faces its own unique set of dangers from extreme weather, is at last turning to deal with the threat that climate change poses to its long-term water supply.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTexas’s situation is sufficiently dire that in July, a majority-Republican panel on the state legislature voted unanimously to require the state water planning board to consult with the state climatologist as it advises cities in planning to meet the state's water needs in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe rule change “removes the possibility that the political climate could harm [local water officials’] ability to plan responsibly for the future,” state Sen. Nathan Johnson (D), a major backer of the shift, told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It kind of insulates the regional water authorities from political pressures that would harm their ability to do what they need to do,” Johnson said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut that process won’t bear fruit for years — and Texans increasingly worry that the crisis is here now.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNever rains but it pours\n\n\n\nThe most recent demonstration of the volatile climate was last month’s flash downpours that stunned Johnson’s hometown of Dallas — a record rainfall that interrupted the city's longtime drought, running off baked earth and acres of asphalt infrastructure to flood much of the city.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThose kinds of events offer a foretaste of the future Texas can expect, climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“You saw record dry conditions week after week after week — and then all of a sudden, a summer's worth of rain in a single day,” Hayhoe said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor much of the state, annual levels of rainfall may not change much — but that average conceals potentially lethal extremes of drought and flood, she said. “The amount of precipitation is staying the same. But the distribution is changing. It's getting more extreme in both directions.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if rainfall totals and distribution both stayed the same — which is unlikely — the simple fact of rising heat under climate change could presage water shortages, state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Lakes evaporate faster, water in the ground evaporates faster,” said Nielsen-Gammon, who is also a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&amp;M University.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat’s a problem for a state whose water storage strategy relies heavily on a collection of nearly 200 open-air reservoirs, exposed at all times to the baking sun. Moisture sucked into the air can also worsen flash storms, making rain events large enough to overwhelm the ability of soils to absorb them and catchment infrastructure to trap them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPopulation growth looms\n\n\n\nWhen these disruptive impacts are added to the booming populations foreseen by the Texas Water Development Board — expected by 2070 to surge from around 30 million to 52 million — they create a situation that worries many water planners interviewed by The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMuch of that growth is expected along the dry and vulnerable I-35 corridor that connects Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley to San Antonio, Austin and the enormous collection of towns and cities surrounding Dallas-Fort Worth. The highway roughly divides Texas’s wet east from its dry west.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith that influx of people will come new water-dependent industries, from manufacturing plants such as the new Tesla facility going up outside Austin to more than a dozen high-tech semiconductor factories. And even with climate change making the weather ever more extreme, the state is fighting hard to protect fossil fuels. Those take a lot of water too, particularly when oil and gas is extracted through fracking.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If any community in the state fails, and its water supply, that is big national, international news, and then has impacts on, I would argue, on the economic growth and perception of Texas,” Robert Mace of the Meadows Center for Water and the Environment told local station KXAN, which is owned by The Hill’s parent company, Nexstar Media.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe looming prospect of a more intense and unpredictable drought-flood cycle presents a fearsome challenge for water planners.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s also one that — at least as it pertains to climate change — local officials have largely been left to figure out on their own, state water experts told The Hill.\n\n\n\nFor now, members of the Water Development Board “certainly don't appear to be addressing [climate issues] directly,” Nielsen-Gammon, the state climatologist, told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the state’s specific and data-driven approach to planning for population growth, “there isn't any official projection as far as streamflow or groundwater recharge impacts from climate change,” he added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It'd be really nice if individual water suppliers weren't left to their own devices to tackle the issue.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the Texas Water Development Board’s planning process has traditionally looked backward, not forward, in envisioning the worst-case scenario that managers should plan for.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“By not considering climate change, we're counting on water that's probably not going to be there in the future,” Mace told KXAN said. “And so that increases the risk of reservoirs going dry, and of people losing their water supplies.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncorporating climate planning, however, is extraordinarily difficult.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The key word with climate is complicated,” Matt Nelson, a water resources professional at the Texas Water Development Board, told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEven at the state level, Nelson said, models are ambiguous, leaving the coming effects on the ground unclear. That means that state officials who move quickly to, say, increase supply are at risk of installing expensive and potentially “maladaptive” infrastructure aimed at solving the wrong problem, he added.\n\n\n\nThe long-term trend of climate change — to the extent that it’s clear — is also easily drowned out in the near-term chaos of Texas weather, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There can be more substantial risk in the near term than a climate long-term effect,” Nelson said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLocal groups take action\n\n\n\nSome individual water suppliers have taken the state’s absence as an invitation to make their own plans.\n\n\n\nFor the city of Austin, the onrushing threat of climate change has led the city to study its own vulnerability — and to secure its water supply out past 2100, by which point its population is expected to triple from 1.1. million to 3.3 million.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Water utilities are the canary in the coal mine when it comes to climate change.&nbsp;The nature of our product is such that we have to be responsive and adaptive to these changes as they're happening in real time,”&nbsp;program manager Marisa Flores Gonzalez of Austin Water told The Hill.\n\n\n\nOver the turbulent century to come, \"we may have periods of time where we have plenty of water around — more water than we want,” Flores Gonzalez said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“But we need to be able to take advantage of those supplies when they're present during average or wet conditions and store that water so that we can make use of it during drought times.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAustin is exploring a number of ways to do this.&nbsp;City officials are scouting locations where excess water could be injected into natural subterranean caverns in periods of abundance — in effect creating an artificial aquifer, immune to evaporation, that the city can draw on during the extended dry periods to come.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGroundwater injection is a measure that many other cities around the state are pursuing — most notably San Antonio, an hour’s drive south of Austin, but also smaller cities such as El Paso and even folk music mecca Kerrville.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDallas-Fort Worth and other cities of the north Texas sprawl are building new reservoirs as fast as possible, and both Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston are exploring ways to pipe in water from other basins as they look to a future where their own stores will be overtaxed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut with “really out of the box unprecedented things are definitely being discussed, we often neglect the easiest and most common one — which is conservation,” Hayhoe said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAustin, for example, has winnowed the amount of water needed per person per day by a nearly a third since the 1990s, and it’s about a quarter of the way through a campaign to switch all the city’s analog water meters to leak-detecting smart ones.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd the city is experimenting with pilot sewage recycling systems —&nbsp;which treats wastewater on-site for reuse&nbsp;in watering, fountains and flushing toilets — which could ultimately cut demand for water by 75 percent, KXAN reported.\n\n\n\nAt the extreme end of this strategy, the residents of Big Spring, Texas — in the state’s arid far west —&nbsp;drink purified and treated wastewater, a system officially called “direct potable reuse” and sometimes derided as “toilet to tap,” public radio station WHYY reported.\n\n\n\n'The lowest point that I've ever seen'\n\n\n\nNelson at the Water Development Board says the board is working to incorporate usable climate models into its planning process.&nbsp;Board researchers are working with Nielsen-Gammon to try and derive standardized rules and models that are sufficiently flexible to bring to bear on state planning processes, such as trying to figure out how changing heat levels will impact evaporation from different regions’ lakes and rivers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe state itself lags behind growing cities such as Austin, Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth, where local governments have done their own expensive climate forecasting — and many of which are already in the process of securing new supplies against their booming populations.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut most of Texas’s more than 1,200 incorporated towns and cities don’t have the resources to do their own climate planning — and are less likely to have multiple options to draw from in the case of a crisis.\n\n\n\nThat’s happening even just west of Austin, as former cattle ranches in the region known as the Hill Country — popular for its wineries and swimming holes — get converted into housing developments, which demand water for taps, toilets and lawns.\n\n\n\n“With the explosive growth,&nbsp;the wells [are] at the lowest point that I’ve ever seen,”&nbsp; hydrologist Douglas Wierman told KXAN.\n\n\n\nWieman warned that these communities are draining the Lower Trinity Aquifer to the “tipping point where our demand for water resources has outpaced the ability of our aquifers and rivers to replenish themselves,” Wierman added.\n\n\n\nIn the Hill Country, that’s meant a booming business for “water haulers” making deliveries&nbsp;to families whose wells no longer reach the shrinking water table, KXAN reported.\n\n\n\nA cruel paradox of Texas water politics is that those municipalities most vulnerable to climate change are likely to be least willing or able to prepare on their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe smaller the city, Nielsen-Gammon said, “the smaller the water supply — and the less likely they will be able to deal with climate change and possibly not even be willing to consider it because they have more immediate concerns.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s those bodies that are at the greatest risk from climate change, Perry Fowler of the Texas Water Infrastructure Network told KXAN.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If local entities aren't already looking at fortifying their water sources, then they're already really behind the eight ball on that,” Fowler said.\n\n\n\nKXAN's Mia Abbe and Christopher Adams contributed to this report.\n\n\n\nPreviously in this series:\n\n\n\nTexas cattle industry faces existential crisis from historic drought\n\n\n\nLakes Mead and Powell are at the epicenter of the biggest Western drought in history\n\n\n\nSeven stats that explain the West’s epic drought\n\n\n\nWhy Great Plains agriculture is particularly vulnerable to drought",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/equilibrium-sustainability/3623268-california-gas-powered-car-ban-could-fuel-gop-legal-battle/",
        "description": "California last week approved the country’s most ambitious electric vehicle (EV) targets, charting a course to banning the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow the question is whether Republican officials will be able to derail it in court.\n\n\n\nDeborah Sivas, an environmental law professor at Stanford Law School, told The Hill that automobile manufacturers are already poised to make the changes outlined in California’s Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which was approved by the California Air Resources Board last Thursday.\n\n\n\n“They're going to electric vehicles — they're just going faster or slower, depending on the philosophy of the company,” Sivas said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Who would be opposed to this?” she asked. “Well, there's the ideological opposition.”\n\n\n\nThe GOP counter-offensive could take various forms, but will likely include lawsuits arguing that California does not have authority to set its own standards, and efforts to further erode federal Clean Air Act.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCalifornia’s new rule, which follows a 2020 executive order issued by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), would increase the proportion of emissions-free cars sold in the state annually, until that percentage reaches 100 in 2035.\n\n\n\nCalifornia’s targets extend far beyond federal goals, and many states have expressed their intention to follow suit. While President Biden said last year that he hoped half of new vehicle sales would be electric by 2030, California’s rule would require 68 percent of sales to be electric that year.\n\n\n\nBut in order to move ahead, California needs to apply for a special waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as mandated by the Clean Air Act.\n\n\n\nWhen Congress passed the Clean Air Act in 1970, it authorized California to set its own separate and stricter-than-federal emissions standards for vehicles.\n\n\n\nSuch action was deemed necessary due to historic smog that polluted the Los Angeles region.\n\n\n\nBut because the Clean Air Act includes a provision prohibiting states from implementing their own standards, California must apply for a waiver with the EPA for each new rule it wants to enact.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe EPA must then approve that waiver unless the administrator determines that California’s reasons for applying are “arbitrary and capricious,” per the Clean Air Act.\n\n\n\n“Congress wanted it to be easy for California to get a waiver, based on what local authorities felt in their judgment,” Sivas said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile the Biden administration is expected to accept California’s new application, red states could sue over that decision.\n\n\n\nFurther, a future Republican administration could revoke a previously-issued waiver, as the Trump administration did for a waiver that was issued in 2013.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublicans are already expressing opposition to Californina's rule, with U.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) calling it \"bad and stupid.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think that policy only harms people from the standpoint that government is going to dictate what you can buy. Here we are with people with that like minded opinion that they know best and want to control all,\" he said last week, according to local news.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nClues about how this may play out can be found in the conflict around that 2013 waiver, which the Biden administration reinstated in March.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn May, the Republican attorneys-general of 17 states filed a lawsuit accusing EPA Administrator Michael Regan of violating the Constitution’s equal sovereignty doctrine by granting California the authority to set emissions restrictions that are stricter than the national limit.\n\n\n\nOhio Attorney General Dave Yost, who led the lawsuit, previously said in a statement from last year that vehicle emissions standards should be set by the federal government.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"As a practical matter, this is not a waiver of federal regulation — it is a delegation of federal authority to a state, and an improper one at that,\" he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Sivas characterized the legal theories presented in the May lawsuit as “kind of questionable,” she said that there could be an additional lawsuit filed against any future waiver the EPA grants.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Some folks opposed to the rule could try to directly challenge it on various grounds in state court,” Sivas said. “But I think the most likely and the suit with the most teeth is going to be to challenge the waiver that gets granted. So that's a federal suit.”\n\n\n\nIf a new waiver from the EPA entirely replaces the old one, then California could argue that the May lawsuit is moot, according to Sivas.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, that would not necessarily prevent the petitioners from demanding that the case be heard anyway — as it could address legal issues that might arise again in a future challenge, she explained.\n\n\n\n“Those 17 states are looking to take down that whole provision of the Clean Air Act,” she said, adding that these states want to make it impossible to even issue such waivers.\n\n\n\n“I would normally say, that case has a pretty slim chance,” Sivas added.\n\n\n\nWhile she believes that the D.C. Circuit — the destination for any future such lawsuit — would reject the case, Sivas said this might not be true for those above them. Historically, it has been difficult to challenge agency decisions at the Supreme Court, but its recent rightward tilt complicates the issue, she explained.\n\n\n\n“Given what's going on at the Supreme Court — and this case will clearly go up right up to the Supreme Court — it's hard to predict what that court might do,” she said.\n\n\n\nSivas highlighted a June decision where the Supreme Court restricted the agency’s power to oversee power plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“They've not shown any inclination on these big policy-type issues to defer to the agency,” she continued. “So I think it's a big question mark.”\n\n\n\nMargo Oge, who was the director of the EPA’s Transportation and Air Quality office for nearly two decades, said new language in the Democrats’ recently passed Inflation Reduction Act puts the California waiver on stronger legal footing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn addition to investing nearly $370 billion to fight climate change, that bill labels greenhouse gasses as air pollutants, meaning that it more explicitly enables the EPA to fight them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There is a lot of strengthening of the Clean Air Act,” she said. “And it will protect, I think, California's efforts.”\n\n\n\nJody Freeman, a professor of administrative and environmental law at Harvard Law School, said she did not expect car makers to join the GOP opposition, and added that California “leaning in like this is important because it lays down a marker.”\n\n\n\n“It will be awkward for the auto industry to oppose it,” she told The Hill in an email, adding that manufacturers are currently pouring billions of dollars into electrification.\n\n\n\n“And there is so much federal funding flowing to support both infrastructure and consumer demand,” Freeman said.\n\n\n\nFor the automotive industry, planning for vehicle fleets takes years, so even if the California rule is defeated companies may already be on a path to compliance.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It takes a long time — for about five years — to develop a solid plan,” Cynthia Williams, Ford’s global director of sustainability, told The Hill. “It takes time to build your supply chain in order to make sure that you have the right material to build the vehicles.”\n\n\n\nWilliams stressed that the company is committed to shifting toward selling a greater share of EVs, even if California’s rule were to be overturned.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We plan to forge ahead with our plan despite who’s in office or who’s in a leadership position,” she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, Freeman acknowledged that “there are likely going to be legal ebbs and flows as this policy unfolds.”\n\n\n\n“The Biden administration will surely grant the federal preemption waiver needed to approve California’s rules, but a new administration could revoke it, and then we’d be back in the courts,” Freeman said.\n\n\n\nSivas also said there is bound to be pushback from other entities like the fossil fuel sector, which tends to have more political influence than the auto industry.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I really hesitate to make any predictions,” Sivas said, noting that the recent activities of the Supreme Court were fueling her uncertainty.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“They're using environmental cases, to some extent, to really radically rethink the law,” she added. “So I just don't have any confidence in predicting what might happen.”",

        "description": "The American West is experiencing its driest period in human history, a megadrought that threatens health, agriculture and entire ways of life. DRIED UP is examining the dire effects of the drought on the states most affected — as well as the solutions Americans are embracing.\n\n\n\nThe threat that extremes of drought and flood pose to Texas’s long-term water supply are just one aspect of the danger that intense weather — strengthened by the warming climate — poses to the Lone Star State and its people.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We are already the most vulnerable state in the country to these extreme weather disasters,” climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe told The Hill. “And then we have climate change loading the dice against us.”\n\n\n\nHere are five reasons why climate change is making Texas a more dangerous and unpredictable place.\n\n\n\nTexas gets all the weather\n\n\n\nClimate change takes normal phenomena and turns them freakish. That’s bad news for Texas, which has a wide range of possibilities for destruction even before rising heat enters the picture.\n\n\n\nThe chances of being struck by an severe weather disaster — such as the $125 billion onslaught of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 — are like the odds of rolling two sixes on a pair of dice, said Hayhoe, a chief scientist for The Nature Conservancy who helped Austin put together its 100-year water plan. Texas, she said, already has extra sixes on its dice.\n\n\n\nAnd climate change is turning some of them into sevens, she added.\n\n\n\n“If you live in Kansas, you don't really have to worry about hurricanes or wildfires, and if you live in Oregon, you have to worry about wildfires and drought, not to worry about hurricanes,” Hayhoe said. “If you live in Texas, you have to worry about everything.”\n\n\n\nClimate change is disrupting natural cycles&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne challenge in talking about climate change in Texas is that the state’s weather has always been defined by strange, difficult-to-forecast extremes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe state’s climate helps explain why “all the major lakes in Texas are created by people,” said Tom Gooch, vice president at a Fort Worth-based infrastructure engineering firm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the state’s boom-and-bust water cycle, “it's very difficult to get a reliable surface water supply to almost everyone if you don’t store the water,” Gooch said.\n\n\n\nTo the extent that there is an overall pattern, it’s the annual migration inland of a mass of hot, dense air during Texas’s stifling summer.\n\n\n\nThe hot air mass hunches atop the state, “deflecting storms away from the region,” Hayhoe said.\n\n\n\nAs the world warms, Hayhoe’s research has shown that a ridge of high-pressure hot air — which usually rolls back east over the Gulf of Mexico as the weather cools — will stay in place for longer, exacerbating and lengthening droughts.\n\n\n\nThen when it finally does break up — and storms bring long-delayed precipitation — rains will be bigger and more intense as the hot air sucks up, holds and ultimately releases more water than it might have during storms in the 20th century.\n\n\n\nThe extremes are growing\n\n\n\nBy some metrics, such as average rainfall, the situation for Texas throughout the century to come doesn’t look that bad.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Climate models, on average, have a slight decrease going forward, but there's not a strong consensus on that,” state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon told The Hill.\n\n\n\n“So if we took a simple-minded approach of saying, ‘drier means less rain,’ it's not at all clear that we'll have less rain. It's not even clear that climate change is bringing rainfall levels down to what they were 100 years ago.”\n\n\n\nBut those averages may conceal the way that dangerous extremes are being stretched in both directions, Hayhoe said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If you looked at that precipitation over the whole year, you'd be like, ‘Oh, well, there's not really much change.’ But there is a world of difference between a summer where you get the rain evenly distributed — versus one in which it’s “drought, drought, drought, drought, drought, floods.”\n\n\n\n\"If you live in Texas, you have to worry about everything.\"Climate researcher Katharine Hayhoe\n\n\n\nScientists have gotten better at determining how much the human burning of fossil fuels over the past century has strengthened disasters such as hurricanes and heat waves — with one recent study finding that climate change increased the amount of rain released by Hurricane Harvey by about 37 percent.\n\n\n\n“Climate change is a threat multiplier,” Hayhoe said. “In most cases, it’s not creating something new that you've never seen before. It's taking something that you already are at risk from and making it worse.”\n\n\n\nGOP officials remain reluctant to face climate change\n\n\n\nEven as near-record drought and record flooding have pounded the state, Republican state-level politicians have near categorically refused to talk about the threat from climate change — let alone the role the state’s fossil fuel industry plays in worsening it.\n\n\n\nWhen a reporter asked Gov. Greg Abbott (R) about the role of climate change in the recent Dallas-Fort Worth floods, Abbott pointedly refused to use those words.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We’re constantly looking at what extreme weather may lead to, whether it be power, demand, extreme heat, extreme cold, heavy water or even drought,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Texas, “you might hear that we're having extreme weather events with increasing frequency. But people still don't like to say ‘climate change,’” state Sen. Nathan Johnson (D) of Dallas told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Just extreme weather events with increasing frequency — which seems to me to change in the climate,” Johnson added.\n\n\n\nThe state’s antipathy toward climate talk is such that just two days after the Dallas-Fort Worth floods, Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar announced the state was&nbsp;banning state and local governments from doing business with ten major banks&nbsp;— including BlackRock and Goldman Sachs — that he accused of using climate change as an excuse to boycott the state fossil fuel industry.\n\n\n\nInfrastructure — and society — isn't built for the new normal\n\n\n\nThat fact that weather is becoming more dire “in both directions is bad news, because we’re just like Goldilocks,” Hayhoe said. “We don’t want it too wet or too dry; we want it just right.”\n\n\n\nMost aspects of modern society — from building codes to flood insurance requirements to where crops are grown — are built on the implicit and mostly unquestioned assumption of “a stable, stationary climate,” she said.\n\n\n\nThose assumptions helped determine, for example, who in Houston needed to get flood insurance — those in properties with a 1-in-100 chance of flooding under National Flood Insurance Program requirements.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut plenty of Houstonians who weren’t even in the 1-in-1000-year flood zone saw their houses flooded, generating losses that they weren’t insured for, Hayhoe said.\n\n\n\n“These definitions are no longer relevant to our lives today,” she said.\n\n\n\nPreviously in this series:\n\n\n\nTexas cattle industry faces existential crisis from historic drought\n\n\n\nLakes Mead and Powell are at the epicenter of the biggest Western drought in history\n\n\n\nSeven stats that explain the West’s epic drought\n\n\n\nWhy Great Plains agriculture is particularly vulnerable to drought",

        "description": "Republicans are looking to hit the reset button on their Senate midterm election playbook after weeks of poor polls and stories about Democratic momentum.\n\n\n\nSenate GOP candidates emerged from primaries battered, bruised and struggling to gain traction in their general election matchups. Even GOP leaders in the upper chamber began expressing reservations about “candidate quality” and the party’s ability to win a majority.\n\n\n\nBut they now appear to be recalibrating — moving around funds, shifting messaging and sounding notes of optimism about their chances of picking up seats nearly two months out from Election Day.\n\n\n\n“I pick out three of our candidates every summer that I think have the best shot at winning and invite them, and I picked these three because I thought they were in critical states and had a good chance of winning,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters in Kentucky on Monday.\n\n\n\nThe Republican leader was&nbsp;answering a question&nbsp;about a fundraiser he held in the Bluegrass State last week for Republican Senate candidates Mehmet Oz, who is running in Pennsylvania; Herschel Walker, who is vying for a seat in Georgia; and Rep. Ted Budd, who is looking to join the upper chamber representing North Carolina.\n\n\n\nThe three candidates, all of whom are backed by former President Trump, have struggled to pull ahead of their Democratic opponents in recent polls. Oz and Walker have been at the center of a number of controversies, plaguing their standing on the campaign trail. And earlier this month, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report&nbsp;shifted Oz’s race&nbsp;from a “toss up” to “lean Democrat.”\n\n\n\nCampaigns and political parties almost always undergo some changes as they pivot from primary season toward the general election, moderating various positions staked out in primaries and reevaluating where to best spend their resources.\n\n\n\nBut Republicans have been at the brunt of a wave of stories in recent weeks about Democratic momentum, particularly in key Senate races, as well as polls showing Democratic Senate nominees leading in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nThe latest public optimism from McConnell marks a shift from just a few weeks ago, when he conceded that the House has a&nbsp;better chance of flipping&nbsp;than the Senate because of “candidate quality” —&nbsp;a statement that, while in line with expectations, drew headlines because it came from the top Republican.\n\n\n\nThe comment was seen as a veiled reference to Oz, Walker, GOP Senate candidate Blake Masters in Arizona and J.D. Vance, a Republican running for the upper chamber in Ohio. The latter two have also struggled to secure commanding leads&nbsp;against their Democratic opponents in recent polls.\n\n\n\nThis week, however, McConnell said he had “great confidence” in Oz, adding, “I think Oz has a great shot at winning.”\n\n\n\nDemocrats are favored to win control of the Senate over Republicans, according to election handicapper&nbsp;FiveThirtyEight, 66 percent to 34 percent.\n\n\n\nOne Republican strategist said the change in tone from McConnell is “part of the natural swing” from primary season to the general election campaign.\n\n\n\n“What McConnell has to do is play the expectations game, and he wants to downplay expectations that they're gonna do well, but not at the expense of hurting the candidates,” said strategist Terry Sullivan, who has worked on a number of Senate campaigns. “So he's trying to make, to balance that. So he's in a tough spot.”\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes, Republican groups are also already moving money around.\n\n\n\nMost recently, the Senate Leadership Fund — a GOP super PAC aligned with McConnell —&nbsp;scrapped $8 million worth of advertisements&nbsp;in Arizona that were scheduled to air between Sept. 6 and Oct. 3, according to&nbsp;AdImpact&nbsp;and&nbsp;Politico.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, One Nation, a group affiliated with the Senate Leadership Fund, is spending an additional $10 million-plus on television, radio and digital ads in a number of states with competitive races this cycle, including Arizona, according to&nbsp;CNN.\n\n\n\nMasters, a venture capitalist, has consistently come in behind incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) in recent polls. He is trailing Kelly in&nbsp;FiveThirtyEight’s average of polls 50.2 percent to 42.4 percent, and on Wednesday the election forecaster Sabato’s Crystal Ball moved the race from “toss-up” to “lean Democrat.”\n\n\n\nSenate Leadership Fund President Steven Law told Politico that while the group is “leaving the door wide open in Arizona,” the advertising adjustment in the Grand Canyon State was in part due to an “unexpected expense in Ohio.”\n\n\n\nThat unanticipated cost was a&nbsp;$28 million ad reservation&nbsp;the PAC took out in the Buckeye State last month to bolster Vance as he struggles to pull ahead of Rep. Tim Ryan (D) in a race the Cook Political Report rates as “lean Republican.”\n\n\n\nThe group also added $9.5 million to the Pennsylvania race last month, according to&nbsp;The Washington Post, where Oz is trailing Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D).\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the Senate Leadership Fund pulled about $1.7 million in advertisements in Alaska, according to Politico, where Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) is facing a general election challenge from Trump-backed GOP candidate Kelly Tshibaka. Law said the group opted to slash some ads because the incumbent “is in a very strong position.”\n\n\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee is also rearranging where its funds are going. Last month, the Post reported that the group had cut roughly $10 million in ads in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona. The organization said that while it is still committed to those races, it is looking to prioritize advertisements taken out with campaigns and ones that are more financially feasible.\n\n\n\nThough the group also said it added more than $4 million in televisions advertisements in Pennsylvania, according to the Post.\n\n\n\n“With these committees, they're always moving the money around and they're moving money and placing bets on where they think it'll pay off,” Sullivan, a founding partner at the public affairs firm Firehouse Strategies, told The Hill. “That is just very, very normal.”\n\n\n\nHe noted, however, that where the funding is being redirected to is “telling.” For example, with extra funds being spent in Ohio — which Sullivan called a “Republican state” —&nbsp;less money is being allocated to swing states or pickup states.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGOP strategist Doug Heye, who previously served as communications director at the Republican National Committee, noted that cutting advertisements in states is often “a sign of strength, not a sign of weakness.”\n\n\n\nAs Republican organizations rearrange funding, GOP candidates are beginning to tailor their messages —&nbsp;especially&nbsp;when it comes to abortion&nbsp;and the 2020 presidential election — as the race moves away from the primary stage.\n\n\n\nMasters has emerged as somewhat of a poster child for this. The Arizona Republican posted an ad on&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;last week characterizing his view on abortion as “commonsense.”\n\n\n\n“Look, I support a ban on very late-term and partial-birth abortion. And most Americans agree with that. That would just put us on par with other civilized nations,” he said in the ad.\n\n\n\nAccording to&nbsp;NBC News, Masters edited his campaign website to scrub a statement that said “I am 100% pro-life,” remove a line that outlined his backing of “a federal personhood law (ideally a Constitutional amendment) that recognizes that unborn babies are human beings that may not be killed.”\n\n\n\nMasters also revised his website to take out a line suggesting that Trump was not reelected in 2020 because it was not a “free and fair” race, according to CNN.\n\n\n\nSullivan said the changes on the two polarizing issues represent the normal procession from primary season to the general election campaign.\n\n\n\n“A lot of these folks had to win a primary, and now they have to win a general election, and so the issues you are emphasizing are gonna change in those situations,” he added.\n\n\n\nThe GOP strategist added that the adjustments being made by Republican candidates represent a shift from “red meat rhetoric” to messaging that will attract suburban swing voters.\n\n\n\n“I think a lot of it is more mold shifting from a primary fight to a general election fight,” a Republican strategist involved with Senate races told The Hill. “I think all candidates sort of have to better tailor their message.”\n\n\n\nHeye, the GOP strategist, said the adjustments being made across the map are a result of the political and campaign landscapes “constantly shifting,” especially in the current cycle.\n\n\n\nAnd according to Sullivan, the landscape right now — nearly two months from Election Day — will mean little come November.\n\n\n\n“We are a lifetime away from Election Day,” Sullivan said. “If you’re an undecided voter, you’re not paying attention to candidates at this point. It’s gonna be well after Labor Day, you’re gonna start to tune in, and so right now, you know, where people are at today doesn’t matter, what matters is where they’re at in a month.”",

        "description": "When John Fetterman this week urged President Biden to decriminalize marijuana, he received cheers from all corners of the Democratic electorate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor years, Fetterman, Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor and the party’s Senate nominee, has supported the reform he believes will create a fairer criminal justice system. While Biden didn’t address his request directly, Fetterman’s push is the latest way liberals are angling for more influence ahead of the midterms.\n\n\n\nIn November, they just might get it. Progressives may have had an overall disappointing primary season, but they did come out on top in a small number of races with outsized importance.&nbsp;Now they are looking to the fall as an opportunity to prove that they can be the safe choice for voters who care about electability — and, should they win, to elevate more of their signature issues.\n\n\n\n“That’s exactly what we’re seeing,” said Naveed Shah, political director at Common Defense, a progressive group that endorsed Fetterman and several other liberal candidates this cycle. Democratic candidates are “taking on a lot of these same issues that progressives have been talking about for a long time, whether it’s student loans or expanding health care or anything else.”\n\n\n\n“That’s a big shift,”&nbsp;Shah&nbsp;said. “Even for folks who aren’t progressives in name, they are taking on more of these progressive ideas. That’s exactly the goal. The goal isn’t just to get progressives that bear the title elected, it’s really to shift the party.”\n\n\n\nA string of progressive Democratic candidates are inching towards winning their general elections from the Rust Belt to the South. In many cases, they have overcome centrist competitors under tough circumstances.\n\n\n\nModerates often say that the left will face a true test of power and longevity when waging the political war against Republicans, not more marginal battles within their own party. Indeed, there’s no shortage of Trump-aligned GOP aspirants flooding airwaves with messaging that progressive nominees will drive the country into a mess along with Biden.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut their efforts have struggled to catch on in critical areas. Fetterman leads his rival, Mehmet Oz, a physician and television personality, in poll after poll, and Republicans have bemoaned their nominee as unsophisticated and disappointing in public and private. On Wednesday, the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics moved the Pennsylvania race to “leans Democratic,” matching the nonpartisan Cook Political Report in the latest encouraging sign for the Fetterman camp.\n\n\n\nBiden, too, sought to put his thumb on the scale in his home state this week.\n\n\n\n“Fetterman’s a hell of a guy,” the president said during a speech on gun control in Wilkes-Barre. “A powerful voice for working people, and he’s going to make a great United States senator.”\n\n\n\nIn the Midwest, Democrats are also watching in close anticipation as Mandela Barnes, the progressive Senate nominee in Wisconsin, looks to unseat Sen. Ron Johnson (R) in the quintessential battleground. Despite being both controversial and unpopular, Johnson has been a mainstay in his party’s conservative establishment for years, tacking toward Trump in his fight against Barnes.\n\n\n\nThe Cook Political Report rates the race as a “toss-up.”\n\n\n\n“That’s going to alter the balance,” said Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of Our Revolution, a grassroots coalition aligned with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), about Fetterman and Barnes's races. “It’s going to put progressives in a more strategic position and it’s going to allow us to hold the line, which we tried to do but couldn’t because we didn’t have the numbers.”\n\n\n\nTo be sure, while Democrats are getting increasingly excited about holding the Senate, and see Fetterman and Barnes as key pieces of that plan, their path to victory is far from easy or guaranteed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut if the duo of Senate hopefuls win on Nov. 8, they would not only likely help Democrats keep their control of the chamber, but would also open the idea of what's possible for the left wing in swing states and in the upper chamber itself, where moderates like Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) have often set the terms throughout Biden’s administration.\n\n\n\n“You know what, we may be able to get rid of the filibuster,” said Geevarghese. “We may be able to dilute the outsized power that Manchin and Sinema hold.”\n\n\n\nThings are expected to be even more lively among liberals in the House. While many Democrats expect to lose the lower chamber, Biden’s uptick in approval has challenged the conventional wisdom about potential margins of defeat and has tamped down the idea that a red wave is coming.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf Democrats lose by just a handful of seats, some are expected to argue that the party in power is still strong, and that they only need to make tweaks in key districts, rather than to their entire strategy and direction.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“They win when they get things done and then talk about it,” said Celinda Lake, a lead pollster on Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign. “Voters often haven’t known what Biden and Dems did.”\n\n\n\nProgressives are already counting victories. And some are making the quiet argument that the Congressional Progressive Caucus, their collective bargaining bloc, is expected to expand by as many as nine seats, including adding to the most fervent members of the “Squad.” That, they say, will allow them to be better organized and continue to push the policy debate in their direction.\n\n\n\nIn Texas, Greg Casar, a former&nbsp;Austin City Council member,&nbsp;is on track to win the general election in the Democrat-safe 35th Congressional District, as is Becca Balint, a public school teacher in Vermont’s 1st Congressional District. Meanwhile, two state representatives, Delia Ramirez in Illinois’s 4th Congressional District and Summer Lee in the area surrounding Pittsburgh are also projected to win. And Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a young activist in Florida, won his primary for a safe Democratic district in a swing state. Many progressive Democrats likely to enter the House are candidates of color.\n\n\n\nThe enthusiasm on the left has coincided with Biden’s own ascent. Previously unable to break out of the low to mid 30s in approval ratings, many centrist Democrats blamed the left flank for encouraging him to take on policies that they saw as too aspirational and costly for most of the country to get behind. They pointed out that Biden won the election against Trump as a moderate and that voters expected him to govern that way.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut as he alleviated some of progressives’ gravest policy concerns, his standing with the public started to change. He signed the Senate-passed Inflation Reduction Act into law and assuaged some of activists' worries around climate change, taxes and health care.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s telling that in the closing period before the general election really kicks off in full post-Labor Day, Biden’s becoming more popular,” said Geevarghese.\n\n\n\nBiden then went a step further by announcing he was going to forgive as much as $20,000 in student loan debt for the most vulnerable borrowers and $10,000 for millions of others, a move that exceeded even some progressives’ expectations.\n\n\n\n“What really I think has been a huge shift, honestly, and I say this as a fan of President Obama, is that President Biden is becoming the most progressive president we’ve ever had,” said Shah. “A lot of his victories have been because of the things that he’s been able to get done with the Progressive Caucus and others on that side.”\n\n\n\nThose policy wins have given progressives a jolt of momentum they hope to carry into the general election, where they are making the argument that they need to give Americans more reasons to vote Democrat over Republican. That, they say, can easily be done by delivering more policy achievements by the fall.&nbsp;And any pushback from moderates about the party's rampant liberalism isn’t as important on the ground, these Democrats say, because voters don't always choose based on ideology.\n\n\n\n“Voters don’t pay attention,” said Lake about the possibility that the left growing in numbers could alienate some people. “Voters like the progressive agenda.”",

        "description": "New farmer Bobbi Wilson stands on land in southern Oregon where she is prepping the land to grow vegetables.Bobbi Wilson Bobbi Wilson is about to kick off her first farming season, prepping the soil to yield ripe tomatoes and potatoes next year. Her plan: to start a small farm market — which she hopes will also include other produce like onions, beans, strawberries and corn — and to eventually expand to grow flowers and raise poultry. For Wilson, this has been 10 years in the making. The 32-year-old living in southern Oregon fell in love with farming during a year off from college, when she worked on a northern Arizona farm in exchange for housing and food.Wilson does not come from a farming background, and she spent years trying to figure out how to access land. Ultimately, she opted to lease part of her mom and stepdad&#x27;s property. If it wasn&#x27;t for this, she said, she wouldn&#x27;t have any options.&quot;I think there&#x27;s kind of this phrase of like &#x27;marry it or inherit it&#x27; kind of thing — like, that&#x27;s the way that people access land, and that&#x27;s not something that was previously accessible to me,&quot; she said.Access to land and the ability to purchase it were rated as the top barriers to entering farming in a new survey released by the National Young Farmers Coalition and analyzed by the University of Wisconsin Survey Center. According to the survey, 59% of young farmers named finding affordable land to buy as very or extremely challenging, and 45% of young farmers named finding available land to buy as very or extremely challenging. The rates were higher — 68% — among farmers of color.&quot;No matter how you look at the data, land access is the top challenge that young people who are involved in agriculture are facing,&quot; said Holly Rippon-Butler, land campaign director at the National Young Farmers Coalition. &quot;It is the No. 1 challenge for current farmers and ranchers. It&#x27;s the top reason that young people report having left agriculture. It&#x27;s the primary barrier to getting started regardless of the region of the country that you&#x27;re in, whether or not you identify as a first-generation farmer or a rancher. It&#x27;s also regardless of age or number of years of experience in farming. And it&#x27;s an even greater challenge for young farmers of color who are experiencing much greater systemic oppression.&quot;Those barriers have created a more dire situation as the average age of a farmer has been steadily increasing over the past few decades. Most recent ag census data shows farmers&#x27; average age is nearly 60 — and that is concerning lawmakers in Washington who say getting a younger generation involved in agriculture is key to building a sustainable food system. Sabrina Pilet-Jones with the Urban Farming Institute reaches for a carton of broccoli for a customer at a Boston farm stand on Aug. 14, 2020.Pat Greenhouse/Boston Globe via Getty ImagesThe pandemic highlighted the need for local and regional food sources The Agriculture Department defines a beginning farmer as one who has been in business for 10 years or less. In the 2017 Census of Agriculture — the last time the USDA collected the data — about 1 in 4 were classified as beginning farmers. That year, the number of young producers — defined as 35 and under — was 121,754, a small slice of 3.4 million total producers. New data is expected to come in 2023. Congressional Democrats and Republicans say ensuring a younger generation of farmers can enter the business is key to upholding local and regional supply chains needed for emergencies, for general domestic food production and to meet the growing demand of local food.As big distributors and producers faced supply chain snags during the pandemic, more people turned to their local markets and sellers to purchase foods they couldn&#x27;t find at the grocery store. Even as many supply chain disruptions have eased, demand has stayed high, according to Heidi Noordijk, small farm coordinator at Oregon State University.Supply chain snags led to empty shelves during the pandemic, like at this Whole Foods produce department in Vauxhall, N.J., in March 2020. Some people turned to local markets and sellers to purchase foods they couldn&#x27;t find at the grocery store.Rich Graessle/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images&quot;During the pandemic, when food access was tight, people were like, &#x27;We want to buy local food. We want to support our farmers and community-supported agriculture,&#x27;&quot; Noordijk said. &quot;There were waitlists happening and just a huge demand wanting to support their local farmers.&quot;At a hearing in July, farmers and representatives of credit agencies and socially disadvantaged groups testified before the House Agriculture Committee about the barriers for young and beginning farmers.Adam Brown, owner of B&amp;B Farms in Illinois, told the panel that his biggest challenge was keeping up with the programs coming out of the USDA and being aware about his options. &quot;I think USDA, from my point of view, does a poor job educating on the programs that are out there and accessible. And with farm bills changing every several years, a lot of the times the programs go away or are new out there,&quot; he said. &quot;We hear about them by word of mouth instead of direct FSA [Farm Service Agency] or county offices notifying us.&quot;Zach Ducheneaux, administrator for USDA&#x27;s Farm Service Agency, the lending arm of the department, told NPR that he knows loan applications can be so lengthy and complicated that prospective farmers can give up.&quot;There aren&#x27;t less stringent collateral and security requirements for young and beginning farmers — they still have to qualify just as an established farmer would,&quot; Ducheneaux said. &quot;We&#x27;re working on streamlining access to all of these things across the board that I think will benefit our young and beginning producers.&quot;Ducheneaux, who lives on the Cheyenne River Sioux Indian Reservation, said it&#x27;s important that groups communicate to lawmakers what changes they want to see made to programs, especially after the pandemic.&quot;We saw in this pandemic how fragile our food system is and if we don&#x27;t have producers that have the ability to develop capacity for internal economic resilience at an earlier stage, our food system is literally in jeopardy,&quot; Ducheneaux said. &quot;We have roughly 40,000 cattle growing on my tribe&#x27;s territory and during the pandemic, our grocery stores didn&#x27;t have any meat on the shelves. So there&#x27;s so much fragility built into this food system.&quot;Advocates are calling for federal help and making recommendationsOn Aug. 24, the USDA unveiled new pandemic aid dollars aimed at getting younger and more diverse people interested in jobs within agriculture — both farming and at the government level. About $300 million is now available to organizations that have projects for helping to increase access to land, capital and markets.&quot;We think there&#x27;s a real opportunity here to expand the universe of people interested at all levels of farming and in food production — and we think it&#x27;s important to maintain our country as a food-secure nation,&quot; Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters. But many changes are still in Congress&#x27; hands for the 2023 farm bill. A sign tells shoppers to stand 6 feet back and not to touch the produce at a farmers market in San Rafael, Calif., in March 2020. Fearful of close-quarters in packed supermarkets that had empty shelves, many shoppers descended on farmers markets they rarely visited in the past.David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images&quot;What&#x27;s happened time and time again over the last several farm bills is everyone goes in with [young farmers] being one of their priorities, but somehow it falls off the list as the farm bill gets created,&quot; said Rob Larew, president of the National Farmers Union, during a panel at the Minnesota Farmfest. Groups like the Young Farmers Coalition are pushing for lawmakers to address land access and barriers to USDA programs in the upcoming farm bill. The farm bill, which gets negotiated every five years, is an avenue for Congress to change the way that federal loan and technical assistance programs work — something the USDA cannot do on its own.&quot;We&#x27;re at this moment now where young people are in crisis in terms of land access, and we need our federal government to act,&quot; said Rippon-Butler of the Young Farmers Coalition, &quot;and we need equity to be at the center of that so that we are creating policies that really center young farmers and ranchers of color and lifts up our whole next generation of young farmers as a whole.&quot;Developing a preapproval process for farm lending, easing requirements for new producers and raising loan limits are just some of the recommendations. &quot;I would ask that we have some predictability going into the next farm bill,&quot; Brown told the House Agriculture Committee. &quot;We have so much volatility throughout my operation, throughout the ag economy. If we know what we are dealing with we can plan better.&quot;For now, those who want to get into farming can look to groups like land grant universities and nonprofits, which have created training programs to teach them how to stand up a successful business. Wilson, the new vegetable farmer, helps train and advocate for prospective young farmers through her work with the National Farmers Union as well as Rogue Farm Corps, an Oregon-based program. &quot;We are helping to ensure that the future of farming is in good hands. The U.S. farming population is aging, and here in Oregon we expect two-thirds of our agricultural land to change ownership in the next 20 years,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;Breaking down barriers to entry and ensuring that new farmers succeed is more important than ever if we want to make our food system more equitable, resilient and life-sustaining for generations to come.&quot; Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "LA Johnson/NPRLast week, President Joe Biden laid out a sweeping plan to cancel up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt per borrower. To get that maximum, individuals must earn less than $125,000 a year, or less than $250,000 a year for couples, and must have received a Pell Grant in college. Non-Pell borrowers who meet those income requirements qualify for $10,000 of forgiveness. Beneath this seemingly straightforward plan, though, is a mountain of uncertainty about how, exactly, it will work. Naturally, borrowers have questions. Here are the answers we know so far:1) Do I have to submit an application for loan forgiveness?Most likely, yes. Those income rules we mentioned will require most borrowers to verify their income with the U.S. Department of Education. About 8 million people already have income information on file with the department; they should qualify to have their debts canceled automatically. But everyone else will have to submit an application to be considered.The Education Department says that application will be available in early October and will take 4-6 weeks to process. Borrowers can sign up for email updates here.There isn&#x27;t currently a deadline to apply for forgiveness, but the administration recommends submitting applications before Nov. 15. That way the department has more time to process millions of applications before the student loan payment pause ends on Dec. 31.2) What kinds of loans are included in Biden&#x27;s forgiveness plan? Undergraduate loans, graduate loans and Parent PLUS loans managed by the Department of Education are all eligible. Biden&#x27;s plan only applies to federal student loans, though; private student loans are not eligible for forgiveness, even if they began as federal loans. If you&#x27;re unsure what type of loans you have,  contact your loan servicer.3) My income fluctuated a lot during the pandemic. Which income year should I look at to see if I qualify for forgiveness? According to a senior White House official, a borrower&#x27;s income from either 2020 or 2021 must meet the loan forgiveness income requirements (less than $125,000 a year for an individual, or less than $250,000 a year for couples) in order for that borrower to qualify for loan forgiveness. More information on how to document your income will be available in the coming weeks.4) Why does everyone keep saying &quot;up to&quot; $10,000 or $20,000?You may have noticed in our coverage we always say borrowers are eligible for &quot;up to&quot; $10,000 or $20,000 of forgiveness. This language comes directly from the Education Department, and it&#x27;s less confusing than it may sound.Basically, if you owe $7,000 in student loans and qualify for $10,000 in forgiveness, you&#x27;ll get all $7,000 erased, but that extra $3,000 won&#x27;t be going into your pocket. That stays with the federal government.One thing to keep in mind: If you made loan payments during the pandemic pause, and your loan balance is now below the baseline $10,000 or $20,000 for Pell recipients, you may want to ask for a refund so you can take advantage of the full forgiveness amount. More on that below. 5) I kept paying off my student loans during the payment pause. Can I get that money back and have more of my loans forgiven?The short answer is yes. Many borrowers kept paying off their federal student loans during the payment pause because, with interest also paused, it was the perfect time to reduce their debts. These borrowers need not worry: They can still benefit from Biden&#x27;s new loan cancellation plan, even if they paid off their student loans during the pause.According to the Education Department&#x27;s office of Federal Student Aid, &quot;You can get a refund for any payment (including auto-debit payments) you make during the payment pause (beginning March 13, 2020). Contact your loan servicer to request that your payment be refunded.&quot;Just remember, it will be a process, and you should make sure you qualify for some level of cancellation, either the baseline $10,000 or the $20,000 for Pell recipients, before requesting your refund. Once the refund is issued, your student loan balance will increase by the value of the refund. For example: Say you currently owe $7,000, after paying $2,000 during the moratorium. Once you receive your $2,000 refund, your balance will grow to $9,000. Your next step, then, will be requesting cancellation for that new total under Biden&#x27;s plan.  Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "The Artemis 1 moon rocket at Launch Pad 39 at the Kennedy Space Center.Gregg Newton/AFP via Getty ImagesNASA&#x27;s Artemis I spacecraft was supposed to head to the moon earlier this week. But after suffering a technical error it had to be delayed until Saturday afternoon.It&#x27;s been nearly 50 years since the last Apollo landing, and the landscape for space exploration has changed drastically since then. One obvious update? This ship has no crew (for now). NASA hopes that later Artemis missions will eventually return humans on the moon.Efficiency, costs, and motivations for the mission have been brought into question leading up to the launch. Lori Garver was the deputy administrator of NASA during the Obama administration and joined All Things Considered to shed light on the process, and the future of humans in space.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Interview highlightsOn the purpose of the missionWithin the space community, this has been something they wanted to do since they left the moon. And I think one of the reasons we haven&#x27;t, is because we haven&#x27;t answered that question [of why they took such a long hiatus]. Today, NASA says it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re in a race with China, but of course, we&#x27;ve won that race six times. So I think the space program is incredibly valuable and the things that we are doing have helped humanity tremendously. Going back to the moon is, I think, a positive path, but I don&#x27;t think we have well articulated the purpose for spending the amounts of money that are now required.On the impact of private space exploration companiesPrivate space companies are actually part of this mission. Of course, they were part of Apollo as well.  Space X has a contract with them to build the lunar lander, but they are also building a large launch vehicle that could get us there for a fraction of the cost of the government owned and operated planned systems that have taken more than a decade and tens of billions of dollars. So this isn&#x27;t an either-or. On the delayed launch of Artemis 1, and other challengesWell, it&#x27;s not just this latest setback that is an issue. It&#x27;s emblematic of why a program that was supposed to take five years has now taken nearly 12. And that was supposed to cost $20 billion, has cost $43 billion. That is something that I don&#x27;t understand how the public and their elected representatives will continue to support once there is a private sector option flying. On what other avenues NASA should expend resources onI think NASA could go back to the moon for significantly less resources in a way that drives technology, which is what really returns to the nation and the planet. The money that they save for doing that could be spent on priorities like increasing the Earth sciences programs, studying greenhouse gas emissions from space, helping us to manage our resources on this planet. There are a lot of ways NASA&#x27;s can contribute to a better world, both here on Earth and beyond.On how space exploration benefits humans on EarthWe believe they&#x27;re inspirational and allow people to invest in themselves and go into fields which help us all. I think there is also a direct return ultimately, and things like being able to detect incoming asteroids. You don&#x27;t need humans in space to do that. But it is exploration. And ultimately, we do have to get off of this planet to survive over the longer term. In my view, that is a multigenerational activity and we need to figure out how to last long enough on this planet in order to be to a point where we can expand beyond in a permanent way.On whether NASA has struggled to keep up with the timesWell, I wrote a book, “Escaping Gravity” that just came out about this. I think, you know, no one&#x27;s bad. It&#x27;s just the status quo in Washington. Contractors already have jobs, they&#x27;re going to argue for keeping those jobs, their members of Congress want them to keep those jobs. And it just becomes sort of a do-over when, in my view, we weren&#x27;t established — we being NASA — to do the same thing again. We are supposed to be driving technologies. And so that&#x27;s why I think many of us are critical of this rocket program, because it really is 1970s technology, and that is not the way we think it&#x27;s best to go back to the moon.On the desire to get to MarsI think within NASA and the some of these private companies, Mars is the ultimate goal. I think that going to the moon is not required before you get to Mars, but it is certainly helpful, and a place where you can learn again to operate at a distance from this planet. I think the goal of getting to Mars for many people is more exciting, but that is an order of magnitude more challenging. Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "Cattle graze amid drought conditions near Ojai, Calif., on June 21. Drought in parts of the country have forced some ranchers to slaughter their cattle early, leading to a drop in beef prices that will only be temporary.Mario Tama/Getty ImagesSupermarket shoppers are seeing something unusual these days: discounts in the meat department. Steak prices have fallen in each of the last three months even as the cost of chicken, pork and most other groceries has gone up. But bargains in the butcher case are likely to be temporary. Severe drought is forcing some cattle ranchers to slaughter livestock early. That&#x27;s producing a glut of beef in the short term, but it&#x27;s also likely to lead to higher prices in the future. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 60 percent of the nation&#x27;s cattle are affected by drought, including Brady Blackett&#x27;s herd of angus cattle, which graze in the high desert of south central Utah.   &quot;The cattle have to travel miles and miles each day in 100-degree weather to get back out to where there&#x27;s adequate enough forage, so it&#x27;s tough,&quot; Blackett says. &quot;Over the last couple of summers, we&#x27;ve actually had to haul water to the cattle because the springs just aren&#x27;t producing enough water to keep up.&quot; Not enough water all aroundBlackett ordinarily relies on runoff from snowpack in the nearby Wasatch Mountains to irrigate the alfalfa his cattle eat in the winter. But thanks in part to a changing climate, snow has been scarce in recent years. He&#x27;s been forced to turn to groundwater, which is rapidly being depleted. &quot;It&#x27;s not looking good for the future, unless we&#x27;re able to get some moisture and pull ourselves out of this drought,&quot; Blackett says, describing arid conditions in much of cattle country. &quot;There were parts of western Kansas and eastern Colorado where the weeds weren&#x27;t even growing.&quot; John O&#x27;Dea raises cattle and hay in southwestern Nebraska. His hay crop this summer is less than half what it would be in a normal year.&quot;We had 200 acres we never planted because we knew it wouldn&#x27;t come up,&quot; O&#x27;Dea says. &quot;At our ranch, we&#x27;ve gotten two decent rains in the last 14 months.&quot;Ground beef and steaks for sale are displayed at a grocery store in Redondo Beach, Calif., on July 13.Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty ImagesSending cattle to slaughter early Without enough feed to get cattle through the winter, ranchers have been forced to send some of their animals to slaughter prematurely.  &quot;We&#x27;ve liquidated a lot of our cows and a lot of neighbors have liquidated anywhere from 20 to 60% of their cow herds,&quot; O&#x27;Dea says.That&#x27;s resulted in more steaks on supermarket shelves, and a temporary drop in prices. But the savings for consumers are likely to be short-lived. In a sign of ranchers&#x27; desperation, many of the slaughtered animals are breeding females — cows and heifers — so the next generation of cattle will be smaller.The USDA reported more beef cows slaughtered in July than any month since recordkeeping began in 1986.  &quot;Life has very few guarantees. But a cow or heifer that is slaughtered this year is guaranteed not to calve next year,&quot; says Wesley Tucker, a field specialist at the University of Missouri extension. &quot;That means there&#x27;s [fewer] animals coming down the line and less beef production in the future.&quot; Ranchers also face rising costsRanchers have lived through this cycle before.  A severe drought a decade ago led to a similar downsizing of herds. Ultimately, that resulted in higher prices for beef — which is an incentive for ranchers to try to hang on to at least some of their cattle now.  Tucker warns, however, even if beef prices rebound, it may not be enough to offset ranchers&#x27; rising costs for everything from diesel fuel to fertilizer. &quot;I don&#x27;t think the price of a tractor is going to go back down next year just because our weather improves,&quot; Tucker says. In Nebraska, John O&#x27;Dea keeps checking the weather forecast for any sign of improvement. So far, he hasn&#x27;t seen any. &quot;Basically, what we&#x27;re doing now is trying to figure out how we&#x27;re going to manage for next season because we know this season is a bust,&quot; O&#x27;Dea says. &quot;I would bet that our first moisture will be blizzards this winter.&quot;O&#x27;Dea also worries that shoppers, faced with high prices elsewhere in the supermarket, may have less appetite for steaks, even at a discount. \n&quot;It&#x27;s definitely a struggle,&quot; he says with a rueful laugh. &quot;We pay the same bills as everybody else and we&#x27;re dang sure not getting rich out here.&quot;\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "A security officer guards the entrance to the Paul G. Rogers Federal Building and Courthouse in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Thursday, where a federal judge presided over arguments at a hearing on former President Donald Trump&#x27;s request for a special master to review classified documents the FBI seized from his home last month.Marco Bello/AFP via Getty ImagesUpdated September 1, 2022 at 2:58 PM ETA federal judge is not yet ruling on former President Donald Trump&#x27;s request for a special master, saying she will enter a written order at some point. There was no indication of when U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who presided over arguments at a hearing on Thursday afternoon, would do so. The judge also said she would unseal a list of items the FBI seized from Mar-a-Lago last month during its search of the former president&#x27;s home. It is unclear when that will happen.A special master is a third party, typically an attorney, appointed by the court in cases where there is sensitive material. Trump&#x27;s request for a special master was the first legal move his made team in the aftermath of the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago resort on Aug. 8.Over the weekend, a federal judge said she was inclined to grant Trump&#x27;s request.The Department of Justice, though, argued in a filing this week that the &quot;appointment of a special master is unnecessary and would significantly harm important governmental interests, including national security interests.&quot;The department also wrote that in the months it took for the DOJ to try and retrieve the documents, Trump&#x27;s lawyers did not make the argument that the former president had declassified the documents he was holding at Mar-a-Lago, which they are now putting forward.The filing raised questions of whether Trump and his team attempted to obstruct justice by concealing or removing some of the documents authorities wanted.In a response, Trump&#x27;s attorneys downplayed the Justice Department&#x27;s concerns about the classified material found at Mar-a-Lago, saying in a filing Wednesday that there was no &quot;cause for alarm.&quot;They added that the Justice Department &quot;significantly mischaracterized&quot; in their filing a meeting in June between prosecutors and Trump&#x27;s legal team. And, they added, that without a special master, prosecutors will &quot;impugn, leak and publicize&quot; details of its investigation.A local law enforcement officer is seen in front of the home of former President Donald Trump&#x27;s Palm Beach, Fla., home, on Aug. 9, the day after it was searched by FBI agents for classified documents.Giorgio Viera/AFP via Getty ImagesLegal experts say a special master is a procedural step, but could delay the investigationSome experts say that if a federal judge does approve Trump&#x27;s request for a special master, it could potentially further delay the FBI&#x27;s investigation. &quot;If a special master were appointed, then he or she would be given some time in which to review the records,&quot; David Laufman, an attorney who formerly led the Justice Department&#x27;s counterintelligence section, told NPR. &quot;And they would sift through materials to determine if anything is truly privileged or not.&quot;Laufman added that he thinks Trump request for a special master was primarily a move to undermine public confidence in the DOJ and FBI. A team at the Justice Department has already reviewed many of the documents and identified some that are covered by attorney-client privilege.Overall, though, Neal Katyal, former acting solicitor general of the United States, told NPR that the potential appointment of a special master is &quot;a large nothingburger.&quot; He says even if a special master was appointed and some of the documents did get returned to Trump, they would be documents that the FBI and DOJ have already seen.\n&quot;It&#x27;s just going to be a procedural hoop that the Justice Department will have to work through,&quot; Katyal said.\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

FN Meka, a rapper created by artificial intelligence who gained TikTok fame through viral short music videos, exists. This fact itself is unfortunate. More unfortunate is that the artificial construct was temporarily signed to Capitol Records. The company dropped FN Meka in response to complaints from Industry Blackout, an activist organization of Black professionals in the entertainment industry, who accused the creators of engaging in racist stereotypes and a modern version of blackface.The journey to FN Meka and the rebirth of the minstrel show was slow, but obvious. Characters like Russel Hobbs of the Gorillaz are guilty of opening the doors for this form of digital blackface, but FN Meka presents a full leap into an older tradition. Instead of donning black makeup, white owners can now create their own Black artists from scratch, built with the racist biases inevitable when artificial intelligence is crafted under a white supremacist society.Akin Olla is a contributing opinion writer at the Guardian Continue reading...",

        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/dr-oz-social-media-pennsylvania-senate-race/671301/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "Sign up for Molly’s newsletter, Wait, What?, here.Mehmet Oz should be a good Senate candidate. He was an accomplished surgeon, performing complicated cardiac procedures at some of the most prestigious hospitals in America. He attended an Ivy League college and an Ivy League medical school. And Dr. Oz is no media neophyte: In 2004, he was plucked from relative obscurity by Oprah, appearing—sometimes in blue surgical scrubs—more than 60 times on her show as “America’s doctor.” His own show ran for 13 seasons (its final episode aired earlier this year). Largely as a result, Dr. Oz has an enormous digital footprint of 3.8 million Twitter followers. That’s more than most of the other Republican Senate candidates combined.And yet, almost every day seems to bring some new social-media humiliation for the doctor in his campaign race for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania. Oz has had great success as a television doctor, but the traits that make someone a successful television doctor are not the traits that make someone a successful political candidate. Twitter gives politicians an opportunity to interact directly with voters, allowing them less filtered access to candidates and more of a flavor of their personality. One of the things that excited Donald Trump’s base about his Twitter account, when he still had one, was that they felt they were connecting with Trump himself, especially when he retweeted supporters.If Trump showed everyone what a powerful tool Twitter, in particular, could be to amplify his message, Oz has demonstrated that for a less adept social-media user, the platform can be a liability, betraying the hidden flaws of a political candidate. (Whether Oz personally does his own posting to Twitter is unclear.) The problem for Oz, which John Fetterman has taken full advantage of, is that Twitter amplifies Oz’s humorlessness.[Read: Pennsylvania becomes the land of Oz]Back in April, Oz posted a short video for Twitter about how inflation was making food more expensive. In it, Oz goes supermarket shopping to buy vegetables to make a platter of crudités. Straight off, he appears awkward in his surroundings and unfamiliar with food shopping. He piles vegetables in his arms instead of using a basket or cart, and he seems to have trouble figuring out what goes on a crudités plate. He picks broccoli and asparagus—neither of which tastes great uncooked—and then adds containers of ready-made salsa and guacamole. As ill at ease as he looks in the store, he seems to be struggling with a deeper confusion: uncertainty about who he’s trying to be.Oz knows how to play a masterful authority figure as a TV medical expert, but he seems clueless about how to be someone you’d want to have a beer with. Oz is good at playing one role—unfortunately for him, that role is not “popular Republican senator” but “know-it-all heart surgeon.”Oz’s difficulty is compounded by Pennsylvania’s strong blue-collar identity. It’s a state that puts a high value on unpretentiousness—and one where beer is generally not served with crudités. The doctor seems to want to promote a healthy eating choice, because that’s consistent with his brand, but it comes off as out of touch and elitist. Fetterman has no such authenticity deficit and knew exactly how to quote-tweet Oz’s crudités video: “In PA we call this … a veggie tray.”Fetterman’s camp later said it had raised half a million dollars off the Oz video. Instead of taking the loss and moving on, Oz’s senior communications adviser, Rachel Tripp, compounded the clumsiness of the video with pure meanness: “If John Fetterman had ever eaten a vegetable in his life, then maybe he wouldn’t have had a major stroke and wouldn’t be in the position of having to lie about it constantly.” Fetterman responded with the statement, “I had a stroke. I survived it. I know politics can be nasty, but even then, I could *never* imagine ridiculing someone for their health challenges.” Tripp only dug herself deeper by tweeting an emoji of an apple, which met with such a flood of scathing responses that she apparently felt forced to limit replies. Even Oz tried to distance himself from Tripp’s comment, telling a Pittsburgh radio station, “The campaign’s been saying lots of things … I can only speak to what I’m saying.”Tripp’s debacle was a reminder that the only person who can really do Trumpism and make performative trash-talking work is Trump himself. Other Republicans who try to imitate him tend to look petty and vindictive, even to committed GOP voters.[David A. Graham: John Fetterman wins on vibes]Then came the controversy about how many houses Dr. Oz owned. At the Carbon County Fair, in Palmerton, Oz was asked by a Democratic activist how many houses he owned. “Legitimately, I own two houses,” Oz replied. He actually owns 10. Fetterman ran wild with Oz’s fib, posting videos that poked fun at how many houses Oz had. Oz tried to shift the discourse back onto Fetterman, suggesting that he’d had a lot of help from his parents, who have money, but the attack didn’t stick—perhaps because Oz’s punch line, “Get off the couch, John,” made him sound like a lifestyle-advice scold again.Another problem with Oz’s 10 houses was that it drew attention to the fact that he’s a latecomer to Pennsylvania. His primary residence was in New Jersey until late 2020, and when he first claimed Pennsylvania residency, he registered at the address of a house owned by his in-laws. He didn’t purchase his $3.1 million house in Pennsylvania until February 2022—well after declaring his candidacy for the Pennsylvania Senate seat—and that has created further opportunity for Fetterman to troll the doctor. In July, Fetterman started a petition to induct Dr. Oz into the New Jersey Hall of Fame and made fun of Oz for being a tourist in Pennsylvania. (Oz also has two houses in Turkey, where he voted in the 2018 election.)Fetterman takes his jovial ribbing offline too. At the end of July, his campaign rented a plane to fly a banner over the Jersey Shore welcoming Oz home to the Garden State. The stunt paired well with his Twitter account’s humorous cameos by the celebrities Snooki and Steven Van Zandt hailing Oz as a fellow New Jerseyan. Oz has tried to retaliate by posting a Photoshopped image of Fetterman and Senator Bernie Sanders in matching sweater vests. Fetterman mocked Oz’s attempt to create a viral meme by posting a deliberately corny picture of a cat with the caption “Graphic design is my passion.” In July, Oz’s campaign posted a meme based on the drama series Lost that featured Fetterman standing in front of a dark sky. Fetterman retweeted it with the comment, “Dr. Oz, would you allow me to give your social media manager a raise?” Fetterman’s wit makes Oz’s social posting appear all the more flat-footed.[Molly Jong-Fast: The Trump enablers truly in contempt of Congress]Fetterman has also made more substantive critiques of Oz’s reputation. In early August, he held a press conference titled “Real Doctors Against Oz,” at which the Montgomery County Commissioners chair and doctor Val Arkoosh told voters that Oz had made “his fortune as a TV scam artist providing reckless medical advice” and hawking “miracle” drugs. Oz has tried harder-hitting attacks too: This week, he tweeted out a link for a site called “inmates for Fetterman,” saying they “support John Fetterman because he’s on the side of murderers, not victims.” So far, this effort at casting Fetterman as soft on crime has gained little traction. According to RealClearPolitics’ polling average, the Democrat is holding a lead of more than seven points.Twitter has a reputation for being a place where liberal elites talk among themselves, but Trump showed that non-college-educated voters will engage with the platform and that a big following on Twitter and Facebook can generate national media coverage and help win votes. Pew Research Center found in 2016 that 62 percent of Americans got their news from social media, and after the election that year, Trump told CBS: “The fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they’re spending much more money than I spent.” Social media was his “method of fighting back,” he said.But Trump’s command of the medium—and his discovery that utter shamelessness was his superpower—obscured its risks for others. It provides people with an X-ray of your personality. Even Tucker Carlson made fun of Oz’s crudités video. Amid signs that Oz has an enthusiasm problem among Republican voters, The Cook Political Report changed its rating of the race from “toss up” to “lean Democrat.”The very things that at one time made Oz a good surgeon—an obsession with detail verging on the pedantic and great assurance in his own authority—make him seem like a mean snob on Twitter. Oz could win non-college-educated Pennsylvanian voters on social media, but first he’d have to learn how to relate to them the way Fetterman does.",

If “left unchecked, the DOJ will impugn, leak, and publicize selective aspects of their investigation,” according to the former president’s legal team.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump maintains he did nothing wrong in possessing cartons of White House documents at his residence, even classified or top secret materials, for more than a year. The Justice Department, in court filings, has described possible criminal obstruction without identifying Trump or anyone else as a target.\n\n\n\nLawyers for Trump assert that the Justice Department’s view that it screened documents found at Mar-a-Lago for attorney-client privilege now requires independent court corroboration, along with backup review by the former president’s representatives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There is no guarantee that the ‘limited set’ of potentially privileged materials identified by the Privilege Review Team constitutes all privileged materials among the Seized Materials,” Trump’s attorneys Lindsey Halligan, James Trusty and Evan Corcoran to U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon (Politico).\n\n\n\nTrump’s lawyers also assert the government’s search by the FBI was unnecessary and occurred in “the midst of the standard give-and-take” between Trump and the National Archives and Records Administration. The Justice Department “gratuitously” released information publicly, including a photograph of classified documents seized from the home, the former president’s lawyers assert (The Associated Press).\n\n\n\nThe former president’s team notably did not claim in its push for a special master that while in office, Trump declassified the documents in question. Chris Kise, the former Florida solicitor general recently hired by Trump to join his legal team, did not sign the filing submitted to the court.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump seemingly admitted that he knew sensitive documents were contained in cartons at Mar-a-Lago on Aug. 8 at the time of the FBI’s search. A Trump lawyer told the government in June in writing that no such documents remained on the property.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“They took them out of cartons and spread them around on the carpet,” Trump wrote on social media, referring to a Justice Department photograph taken during the search and submitted to the court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA hearing on the question of an independent special master is scheduled today in Florida. On Saturday, a federal judge said it was her “preliminary intent” to appoint an independent reviewer, but allowed the Justice Department an opportunity to respond. The Justice Department on Tuesday said it had evidence of efforts at Trump’s residence to conceal classified documents despite a grand jury subpoena in May to produce records removed from the White House and in the former president’s possession.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Trump team says sensitive info “should have never been cause for alarm” in latest filing.\n\n\n\n▪ The Associated Press: Republicans notably silent, split as Trump probe deepens.\n\n\n\n▪ Rebecca Beitsch, The Hill: Justice Department details path of obstruction culminating in search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\n▪ CBS News: Timeline: The government's efforts to get sensitive documents back from Trump's Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\n▪ The Washington Post analysis: The telling gap between what Trump says and what his lawyers argue.\n\n\n\n▪ The New York Times: Here’s how the Justice Department’s photograph of sensitive documents found at Mar-a-Lago, released to a court late on Tuesday, came about.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn the political scene, Trump’s impact on a number of midterm races is not what he had hoped and as a result, some GOP candidates have created a bit of distance with the former president.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs The Hill’s Max Greenwood and Caroline Vakil detail, certain Trump-endorsed candidates, including Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania and Abe Hamadeh, &nbsp;the GOP nominee to become Arizona attorney general, have scrubbed Trump’s presence from their social media accounts following their primary victories. But the list of conservative candidates appearing with the former president during a Saturday rally in Wilkes Barre, Pa., includes Oz (Pocono Record).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats have more confidence about sharing a campaign stage with President Biden, including Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro and Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio). All have appeared with or plan to join the president at events.\n\n\n\nStruggles on the Senate map for Republicans have also forced party leaders to hit the reset button on midterm playbook as momentum grows across the aisle. According to The Hill’s Mychael Schnell, a cadre of Senate GOP candidates have struggled to gain traction in the general election cycle, having emerged from primaries in a weaker position than had been initially hoped.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRhetorically, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) recent comment lamenting “candidate quality” on the right has shone a light on the uphill climb for the party to retake the upper chamber after two years in the minority.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ The Washington Post: Billionaire investor Peter Thiel rebuffs McConnell over Senate rescue in Arizona.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ University of Virginia’s Center for Politics: Senate races in Pennsylvania and Arizona moved to “lean Democratic.”\n\n\n\n▪ The New Republic: Sen.

Charlie Crist (Fla.), the Democratic nominee for the Florida governorship, resigned his seat in Congress on Wednesday as his campaign hits the homestretch in his bid to unseat Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) (The Hill).\n\n\n\nHours after Crist’s resignation, House Democrats regained their three-seat margin when Democrat Mary Peltola was projected to defeat Republicans Sarah Palin and Nick Begich to win the Alaska special election to serve out the remainder of the term of the late Rep. Don Young (R).\n\n\n\nIn the second round of the ranked-choice contest, Peltola won with 51.5 percent to 48.5 percent against Palin, the state’s former governor who Trump endorsed. The win also means that Peltola is the first native Alaskan elected to Congress (The Hill).&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n▪ Hanna Trudo, The Hill: Progressives aim to prove they can win in Congress — and at the ballot box.\n\n\n\n▪ NBC News: Lawmakers warn of potential political violence in campaign's homestretch.\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: The White House calls out DeSantis, Rep.

Education Secretary Miguel Cardona and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh recently wrote to state and local officials encouraging them to pay competitive wages for education positions and to establish teacher training programs to recruit and retain educators (The Hill).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe first lady, a community college teacher by profession, announced the administration’s partnership with private-sector recruiting companies, such as ZipRecruiter, to help schools advertise their available K-12 positions. Indeed.com will set up virtual hiring fairs and Handshake will help recruit college undergraduates who are studying education to enter the field after graduation (USA Today).\n\n\n\nThe president photo bombed the meeting, offering a walk-in quip for his wife: “Whatever she says, I agree with.”\n\n\n\nABC News: In the Charlotte, N.C., school district, the school year began with 400 teacher vacancies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA recent USA Today analysis of existing research suggests many of the U.S. teacher vacancies are related to shortages that predated the pandemic and concentrated in schools serving large percentages of nonwhite students or children living in poverty. Meanwhile, another study found persistent and widespread shortages of non-teaching personnel, such as bus drivers and custodians.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the administration is expected to unveil applications in October for eligible student loan borrowers to register for income-specific debt forgiveness, which was announced by the president in August. Borrowers will have a limited time to apply if they want to see the relief take effect before the end of the year, and even then, experts believe the federal process could be challenging and time-consuming for applicants (The Hill).\n\n\n\nOne big consideration for some borrowers eager to see their student loan debts erased is whether their windfall will be subject to taxation in their states, a potential unwelcome surprise that won’t occur at the federal level (Forbes and CBS News).\n\n\n\nThe president’s plan, which did not go through Congress, could add tax bills as high as $1,100 for student loan borrowers in some states, according to a recent Tax Foundation analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES\n\n\n\n➤ INTERNATIONAL&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA United Nations inspection team this morning was making its way to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant under heavy guard and wearing bulletproof vests when news reports described shelling by Russian forces along the agreed-upon route.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Having come so far, we are not stopping,” International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi said, according to the Kyiv Independent. The Ukraine Foreign Ministry said Russia was in “violation of its commitments.”\n\n\n\nThe largest nuclear facility in Europe is occupied by Russian forces and still operated under duress by Ukrainian staff. The IAEA team is attempting to safeguard the site and prevent a radiation catastrophe amid a war. Kyiv and Moscow, which each agreed to emergency inspections, traded accusations on Wednesday about shelling near the complex (The Associated Press).\n\n\n\nRussia continued Wednesday to use energy as a stealth weapon against its adversaries, which are also its customers, halting natural gas supplies via Europe's key supply route and intensifying an economic battle between Moscow and Brussels. The move raises the prospects of recession and energy rationing ahead in some of the region's richest countries (Reuters).\n\n\n\nThe European Union on Wednesday made it harder for Russian citizens to gain entry into the 27-nation bloc. After failing to put in place a full tourist ban on Russians entering the EU, the nations instead decided to make it more arduous for them to secure short-term visas to enter Europe’s passport-free travel zone. The EU made it tougher for Russian officials and businesspeople to enter the bloc in May (The Associated Press).\n\n\n\nThe funeral for former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev will take place on Saturday, Reuters reports. The Associated Press noted that the Nobel Peace Prize winner who died Tuesday is to lie in state Saturday in Moscow’s House of Unions.

As The Hill’s Saul Elbein writes, the Lone Star State is finally paying attention to the threats that extreme drought and flooding pose to the state’s long-term water supply. It is one aspect of the danger that weather — strengthened by a warming climate — poses to Texas and to native Texans. “We are already the most vulnerable state in the country to these extreme weather disasters,” climate scientist Katherine Hayhoe told The Hill. “And then we have climate change loading the dice against us.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Five reasons extreme weather is bigger in Texas.\n\n\n\n▪ Los Angeles Times: Extreme heat wave pushing California power grid to limit, with rolling blackouts possible.\n\n\n\n➤ PANDEMIC &amp; HEALTH\n\n\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved customized booster shots developed by Pfizer and Moderna to combat the most prevalent sub variants of omicron, known as BA.4 and BA.5, as well as the original COVID-19 virus (The Hill).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn an era of extraordinary advances in tackling infectious diseases, diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, surgery, disease prevention and expertise offered in private and public hospitals, the United States fell behind in 2021.

The month is in full swing and, as a reviewer, I’ve fallen into the pattern of rushing across the city from one venue to another to find my next seat. But, as I sit here, I have a growing sense of discomfort. Like the previous show, and the one before that, I’m the only person of colour in the audience.I fell in love with the fringe on my first visit to the festival when I was 17. There’s magic in the mass coming-together of creativity in Scotland’s capital. And, although a lack of diversity had always prevented me from feeling entirely at ease in the city, I still managed to sing the praises of a place that championed new, exciting talent and celebrated the wonder of art. But this year, the screaming lack of representation felt like a barrier too big to negotiate. Continue reading...",

At this year’s Sydney festival, the company’s artists performed on top of a 2.5 tonne iceberg suspended 20 metres above Sydney Harbour in a commentary on climate change. And in 2018 and 2019, they toured Man with the Iron Neck, a powerful show that used aerial theatre to explore suicide among Indigenous Australians.This week, in a headline show for Brisbane festival, the company premieres a new co-production: Holding Achilles, a queer reclaiming of the Iliad that tells the love story of Achilles and Patroclus through a mix of ultra-physical theatre, visual spectacle and puppetry on a grand scale.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Continue reading...",

It has its name in stage lights and you only have to open a door to hear the sound of wild partying. When it’s time for a feast, someone arrives with a pile of pizza boxes. It is brash, metropolitan and a little dodgy – the home of wheeler-dealers and people who will keep stumm for a price.No wonder Antipholus of Syracuse and his servant Dromio look as if they don’t know what has hit them. It is not only the weird accusations people keep making against them in this unfamiliar town, it is also the hectic pace of it all.

        "description": "Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-AvonJamie Wilkes’s Parolles steals the show in Blanche McIntyre’s unromantic, social media-inflected productionAll’s Well That Ends Well is one of Shakespeare’s least performed, most puzzling plays. Doctor’s daughter Helena is hopelessly in love with Bertram, who is socially way above her. When Helena cures the King of France of a seemingly terminal illness, he grants her request: the choice of any noble youth at court for her husband. Naturally, Helena chooses Bertram. Appalled, he marries her under duress but imposes impossible terms for their physical union and then hurries abroad to war. Helena, determined to have him, follows.Director Blanche McIntyre’s patchily thought-out production is set in the present – cue flashy social media projections that introduce a made-for-secondary-school feel and serve to highlight the improbabilities of the plot (which Shakespeare partially masked by setting the action outside Elizabethan England). The romance aspect of the play is clinically dispatched: Helena (Rosie Sheehy) is brisk and determined; Bertram (Benjamin Westerby) comes across as arrogantly entitled; there is no spark between the two.All’s Well That Ends Well is at the Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon until 8 October Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photo by Jeff Moreland/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Catch up on all the Mets prospects in yesterday’s minor league action! *All results from games played on Wednesday August 31, 2022\n\nTriple-A: Syracuse Mets (52-72)\n\nSCRANTON/WILKES-BARRE 6. SYRACUSE 1 (BOX)\nSyracuse somehow managed ten hits - the same amount as the RailRiders - but only one run. Going 1-for-10 with RISP will do that, and committing three errors doesn’t help matters either. Neither does Mike Montgomery putting your team in an early hole with a poor start. The lone bright spot in this one was Nick Plummer, who had two hits, a walk, and a steal as he works to salvage the end of a poor season.\n\nCF Travis Jankowski: 1-4, R, BB, 2 K, SB (5)\nRF Jake Mangum: 1-5, 3 K\n1B Dominic Smith: 1-4, E (7)\n3B Mark Vientos: 0-4, 2 K, E (13)\nDH JT Riddle: 3-4, 2B, RBI\nSS Yolmer Sanchez: 2-3, K, E (8)\n2B Gosuke Katoh: 0-4, 2 K\nLF Nick Plummer: 2-3, 2B, BB, SB (8)\nC Michael Perez: 0-4, K\nLHP Mike Montgomery: 2.0 IP, 4 H, 4 R, 3 ER, 2 BB, 2 K, L (2-10)\nRHP Stephen Nogosek: 0.2 IP, 2 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 1 K\nLHP Josh Walker: 1.1 IP, 2 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 3 K\nRHP Yoan Lopez: 1.2 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 2 BB, 2 K\nLHP Phillip Diehl: 1.1 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K\nRHP Michel Otanez: 1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 2 BB, 1 K\n\nRoster Alert: New York Mets sent RHP Stephen Nogosek on a rehab assignment to Syracuse Mets.\n\nDouble-A: Binghamton Rumble Ponies (20-30/49-71)\n\nBINGHAMTON 6, SOMERSET 2 (BOX)\nBinghamton scored three in the first, three in the second, then never looked back. Ronny Mauricio and Luke Ritter were the big offensive performers - the former had three hits, all singles, in four at bats, while the latter popped a two run homer. The pitching was unremarkable in terms of peripherals, but did a good job of keeping the Patriots off the board.\n\n2B Wyatt Young: 2-4, 2 R, 2B, BB, K\nLF Carlos Cortes: 1-4, R, K\nSS Ronny Mauricio: 3-4, 2 R, RBI\nDH Luke Ritter: 1-2, R, HR (13), 2 RBI, BB, K\nCF Brandon McIlwain: 0-4, 2 K\nRF Rowdey Jordan: 0-3, BB, 2 K\nC Hayden Senger: 1-4, RBI, K\n1B Jeremy Vasquez: 1-3, 2B, BB, K, E (12)\n3B Nic Gaddis: 1-3, BB, K\nRHP Jose Chacin: 6.0 IP, 4 H, 2 R, 1 ER, 3 BB, 5 K, W (3-8)\nLHP Cam Opp: 1.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 2 BB, 1 K\nRHP Dedniel Nunez: 2.0 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 3 K\n\n\nHigh-A: Brooklyn Cyclones (33-22/63-59)\n\nWILMINGTON 11, BROOKLYN 7 (BOX)\nAn ugly late inning pitching performance wasted a five-run first inning from the Cyclones, as three relievers combined to give up ten runs between the sixth and eighth innings. Jose Mena and William Lugo tagged back-to-back homers as part of the first inning rally, with Jose Peroza, Matt Rudick, and JT Schwartz kicking in multi-hit performances on top of that. Alex Ramirez and Stanley Consuegra, meanwhile, went a combined 0-for-10.\n\nLF Matt Rudick: 2-5, R, 2B, RBI\nRF Alex Ramirez: 0-5, K\n1B JT Schwartz: 3-5, 2 R\n2B Jose Peroza: 2-4, R, RBI, BB, E (5)\nDH Stanley Consuegra: 0-5, K\nC Jose Mena: 2-4, R, HR (8), 3 RBI, K\n3B William Lugo: 2-4, R, HR (4), 2 RBI, K\nSS Shervyen Newton: 2-4, R, K, E (13)\nCF Jaylen Palmer: 1-3, 2B, BB, K\nRHP Christian Scott: 4.0 IP, 6 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 0 BB, 6 K\nRHP Trey McLoughlin: 2.1 IP, 6 H, 4 R, 4 ER, 1 BB, 2 K\nRHP Sammy Tavarez: 0.2 IP, 0 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 2 BB, 1 K, H (2)\nRHP Dylan Hall: 1.0 IP, 3 H, 4 R, 4 ER, 1 BB, 1 K, L (0-2), BS (2)\nRHP Franklin Sanchez: 1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 0 K\n\n\nSingle-A: St. Lucie Mets (27-27/68-52)\n\nST. LUCIE 7, JUPITER 4 (BOX)\nPlenty of 2022 draftees got in work in this one, with both Chase Estep and D’Andre Smith going deep to lead the offense. Eleventh overall pick DH’d and walked twice, while intriguing 8th round arm Dylan Tebrake continued to look too good for the level. Top it off with two more steals from Omar De Los Santos and it’s one of the more interesting nights we’ve had in the system since the draft.\n\nLF Omar De Los Santos: 3-5, R, 2B, 2 SB (70)\nDH Kevin Parada: 0-2, R, 2 BB, K\n3B Chase Estep: 2-3, 2 R, HR (4), 3 RBI, BB, K\nSS Junior Tilien: 0-4, 3 K\nRF Carlos Dominguez: 0-4, 2 K\n2B D’Andre Smith: 1-4, R, HR (1), 3 RBI, 2 K\nC Vincent Perozo: 0-4\n1B Raul Beracierta: 1-3, R, 2B, BB, K\nCF Tanner Murphy: 0-3, R, BB, K\nRHP Carlos Ocampo: 1.0 IP, 2 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 0 BB, 1 K\n\nREHAB ALERT: RHP Eric Orze: 2.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 4 K\nRHP Dylan Tebrake: 1.2 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 4 K, H (1)\nRHP Jordan Geber: 4.1 IP, 3 H, 3 R, 3 ER, 3 BB, 6 K, W (1-0), BS (2)\n\nRoster Alert: Brooklyn Cyclones sent RHP Carlos Ocampo on a rehab assignment to St. Lucie Mets.\n\nComplex: FCL Mets (33-22)\n\nNO GAME (SEASON OVER)\nStar of the Night\nChase Estep\nGoat of the Night\nTrey McLoughlin",

        "description": "GUNNAR HENDERSON. | Photo by Nick Cammett/Getty Images\n    \n\n  So was his hair, unleashed when he swung so hard that his helmet flew off. Twice! Hello, friends.\nGUNNAR HENDERSON! No Orioles fan could have scripted a better result for a dormant Orioles offense than that the very arrival of their new top prospect Henderson would help get them to wake up. That’s exactly what happened on Wednesday, with Henderson hitting a home run for his first ever MLB hit and adding another hit later in the game on the way to a 4-0 O’s win over the Guardians. Check out Andrea’s recap of the game for the lovely totals.\nOne game is one game, and you should never overreact to one game. With that in mind, it was nice to see the immediate impact. Henderson hit the ball hard in three of his four at-bats, and the one ball that wasn’t hard hit was kind of a fluke out - an opposite field foul pop fly that Guardians left fielder Steven Kwan, a Rookie of the Year contender, hauled in with an amazing leaping catch.\nHenderson and the Orioles will have no easy task in trying to take the series in Cleveland with tonight’s 6:10 finale. Recent Cy Young winner Shane Bieber is on the mound for the Guardians, and though he’s probably not in the conversation to win another Cy, he’s doing great this season, with a 3.02 ERA in 24 starts. The two-time All-Star has a 4.78 K/BB ratio for the season and a 1.086 WHIP.\nPicking up one more win against a division-leading Guardians team is going to be important for the Orioles because their wild card competition is playing a bunch of cupcakes right now. The three teams currently holding the AL wild card spots are playing the Cubs, Marlins, and Tigers (Toronto, Tampa Bay, and Seattle, respectively). \nThe Orioles did get help from one of those bad teams last night as the Jays lost to the Cubs. That brings the O’s back to within two games of the third wild card spot, a spot that would, at the moment, play a best-of-three in Cleveland against these Guardians. \nThey also got help from the Red Sox, who held on to beat the Twins. That’s important because the Twins had pulled into a tie with the O’s, and the Twins hold the head-to-head tiebreaker due to Jorge López’s early July meltdowns. (López, of course, is now a Twin.) So the Orioles are back to being a game ahead of the Twins, the first challenger in line in the wild card race.\nAlright, let’s just go back to some awesome Henderson stuff. If you missed that dinger because you were driving home from work or at the grocery store or something, check it out, because it’s amazing:\n\n\nFIRST HIT ✅FIRST HOME RUN ✅ pic.twitter.com/Y6G6ycDiQ1— Baltimore Orioles (@Orioles) August 31, 2022\n\n\n\nThis is one of those videos where you can have a bunch of favorite parts. Mine right now is Jim Palmer’s practically giddy laughter as soon as he realizes how hard Henderson has hit the ball.\nAt the end of the game, Adley Rutschman and Félix Bautista arrived at this delightfully dorky part of the victory celebration:\n\n\nA whole mood: pic.twitter.com/PeYIE8goZ4— OBP Apparel (@OBPApparel) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nJust look at them. That’s two guys on the Orioles who are having that much fun because they’re on a 68-61 team that’s two games back of a wild card spot when every pundit (and many fans, let’s be fair) expected 95+ losses from this team once again. With 68 wins, the Orioles have already equaled the win total of the 2008 squad. One more win to pull even with 2007 and 2011. It would be nice if they can get that tonight.\nAround the blogO’sphere\nGunnar hits 1st HR so hard he lost his helmet (Orioles.com)This moment is captured in the photograph above. Henderson also lost his helmet after picking up his second base hit of the night. After the game, MASN’s Kevin Brown asked if he needed a new helmet. Henderson said he tried on a bunch and they were all too small. He guessed it was because of his hair.\nHenderson makes stated goal a reality (School of Roch)We learned from pregame coverage yesterday that earlier this year, Gunnar texted his girlfriend and told her that he was going to make it to MLB this year. It’s fun for all of us that he was right. Of making it to the show, he said, “The road’s just starting, so the work keeps on going.”\nAdding Gunnar Henderson, Jesús Aguilar shows Orioles are serious about playoff push (The Athletic)One of the two names in this headline supports its thesis.\nOrioles sign Jesús Aguilar to minor-league contract (MLBTR)Related to the above, the Orioles brought in the 32-year-old righty Aguilar, who was designated for assignment by the Marlins and released. Why do the Orioles want him? I have no answer. Aguilar is able to arrive because rosters expand from 26 to 28 today. The O’s have been expected to add DL Hall into the bullpen mix. The other spot seems to be going to Aguilar. They’ll have to clear a place on the 40-man roster to do this. I would guess either Jonathan Araúz or Richie Martin is headed to the waiver wire.\nA season where it’s “best I’ve ever thrown” resumes Thursday for Grayson Rodriguez (Steve Melewski)Not to be lost in all the Henderson excitement is that Rodriguez’s rehab assignment starts today for Aberdeen. Could he possibly pitch his way into being a late September option for the Orioles?\nBirthdays and Orioles anniversaries\nToday in 2007, the Orioles got no-hit by Clay Buchholz of the Red Sox in his second major league game. My memory of that occurrence is this: I was at my friend’s wedding, at which another friend said, “Mark, if you’re not passed out in the grass by the end of the night, I’m going to be disappointed,” and kept handing me screwdrivers. Later, people started making fun of me for caring about the Orioles - they were in their 10th year of being bad at that point - and eventually news reached our inebriated states of this no-hitter. I had no reply. I did not pass out in the grass or anywhere else.\nAnyway, let’s hope the Orioles mark this anniversary by having a huge offensive night rather than stinking like that 2007 team did. It wasn’t a terrible lineup that night! Brian Roberts, Nick Markakis, Miguel Tejada, and Kevin Millar were all over .800 OPS for the season. Ten days after the 30-3 loss, the team just had another crummy game. It was that kind of decade.\nOne lone former Oriole was born on this day: Dean Stone, who pitched 17 games in relief for the 1963 Orioles, the final season of his eight-year MLB career. He passed away in 2018 at age 87.\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday to you! Your birthday buddies for today include: composer Johann Pachelbel (1653), baseball Hall of Famer Jim O’Rourke (1850), Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875), country artist Conway Twitty (1933), actress Lily Tomlin (1939), singer-songwriter Gloria Estefan (1957), TV host Padma Lakshmi (1970), and actress Zendaya (1996).\nOn this day in history...\nIn 1939, Nazi Germany launched an invasion of Poland, marking the beginning of World War II.\nIn 1952, Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea was first published.\nIn 1974, the SR-71 Blackbird jet set a record for flight time between New York and London, measured at one hour, 54 minutes, and 56.4 seconds. That’s a total speed of 1,435 miles per hour. This record still stands.\nIn 1985, the remains of the sunken RMS Titanic were located by a joint American-French expedition.\n**\nAnd that’s the way it is in Birdland on September 1. Have a safe Thursday. Go O’s!",

Liz Truss – already a plausible contender for the “worst prime minister ever” gong before she even assumes office – apparently intends to issue up to 130 drilling licences for oil and gas firms. If the purpose of this is to confront the looming social catastrophe of energy bills, to describe it as an exercise in futility would be generous: it takes the best part of three decades to pump fossil fuels out of the ground and put them onstream.As Russia switches off Europe’s flow of gas via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline – it implausibly cites maintenance work as the reason – the need for drastic, swift action could not be more obvious, yet our soon-to-be prime minister has nothing meaningful to offer.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistGuardian Newsroom: Who will be our new prime minister?Join our panel including Hugh Muir, Jessica Elgot, Owen Jones and Salma Shah as they react to the announcement of the new PM in this livestreamed event.

        "description": "Watched 2021 South Korean Netflix TV series by Contributors to Wikimedia projects from Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\nSquid Game (Korean: 오징어 게임; RR: Ojing-eo Geim) is a South Korean survival drama television series created by Hwang Dong-hyuk for Netflix. Its cast includes Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae-soo, Wi Ha-joon, HoYeon Jung, O Yeong-su, Heo Sung-tae, Anupam Tripathi, and Kim Joo-ryoung.\r\n\r\nThe series revolves around a contest where 456 players, all of whom are in deep financial hardship, risk their lives to play a series of deadly children's games for the chance to win a ₩45.6 billion (US$35 million, €33 million, or £29 million as of broadcast) prize. The title of the series draws from a similarly named Korean children's game. Hwang had conceived of the idea based on his own economic struggles early in life, as well as the class disparity in South Korea and capitalism. Though he had initially written it in 2009, he was unable to find a production company to fund the idea until Netflix took an interest around 2019 as part of their drive to expand their foreign programming offerings.\n\nFinally got around to watching Squid Game. What I liked the most was the exploration and redemption of characters.  The post 📺 Squid Game first appeared on Read Write Collect.",

        "description": "Venice film festival: Five-part miniseries, premiering at Venice film festival, fuses fear and soap opera with satisfying wildness and weirdnessThe Kingdom is a gargantuan hospital in downtown Copenhagen, the sort of institution you only visit if you work there or if you have to. There is a forlorn Christmas tree in the lobby, a one-legged goblin in the lift and a pigeon trapped in the revolving doors. The building (all 16 storeys of it) is a temple to modernity and showcases the best of 21st-century medical science. But it is built on a swamp, the site of the old bleaching pools and the ghost of the dead appear to outnumber the living. The pigeon, on balance, is one of the luckier inmates. It at least has a slender chance of escape.“I can see that most of you have been here before,” quips Dr Pontopidan (Lars Mikkelsen) at the lectern – and although he’s addressing the guests at the establishment’s annual Pain Congress he may also be nodding to the audience at this year’s Venice film festival. That’s because Lars von Trier’s five-part miniseries The Kingdom Exodus marks the director’s belated return to the scene of his classic 90s TV drama, a hospital saga which folded the soap opera in with the horror story to devilish good effect. If the old black magic isn’t as potent this time around, The Kingdom: Exodus contains enough wildness and weirdness to satisfy the fanbase. Watching it is a little like the inpatient experience itself: acres of dead time, sudden dumps of head-spinning information, plus a constant, gnawing sense of dread. Continue reading...",

        "description": "As Minnesota students head back to school, education is returning to the fore as an issue of political contrast. Sagging test scores, debate over classroom curriculum and budget squeezes in many districts are all getting attention from candidates and voters. That’s true in races up and down the ballot — from governor to the Legislature and even state auditor. Approaches to education — whether money or policy — are vastly different among the candidates in the state’s top races.DFL Gov. Tim Walz launched a television ad this week reminding voters of his time as a teacher and his push to ramp up aid to schools — or in the ad’s language, he fought to “fully fund our schools.” The spot takes a swipe at Republican challenger Scott Jensen for questioning whether more money is needed, using a snippet from an interview where he compared education to a “black hole.”Jensen, a former state legislator and past school board member, pushed back on the characterization.“We just gave one of the biggest chunks of money to K through 12 in the history of Minnesota. And evidently, we&#x27;re not fully funded. What does that mean? Is there some threshold and until we get to that we&#x27;re not fully funded? Or when we do get to that? Does that threshold change?” Jensen asked. “We&#x27;ve got to raise achievement and stop thinking that dollars are always going to get us where we have to go.”For years, debate around education has mainly been about how schools are faring financially. Democrats put the focus on whether districts have enough money to hold down class sizes, fairly pay teachers and offer a broad array of courses. Republicans hone in on whether dollars translate into student gains. MN state test scoresReveal deep impact to child learning during pandemicMinnesota studentsContinue to see pandemic impacts to math and readingLately, there has been considerable attention around what happens inside public school classrooms and who has control over curriculum.Republican gubernatorial candidate Dr. Scott Jensen answers questions from the media after a debate with Gov. Tim Walz at Farm Fest on Wednesday.Jackson Forderer for MPR NewsThat’s the fault line emerging in this campaign. DFL candidates, including Walz, are building their education messaging about relieving financial pressure facing schools; In general, Republican candidates zero in more on classroom content and parental control over that. This week, Jensen released a 10-point plan for education. Jensen’s plan calls for more enforcement of student truancy laws. It seeks greater focus on standards to measure math, reading, science and social studies proficiency. He wants schools to be better equipped to deal with children with violent backgrounds or in mental health crises. Perhaps most notable are components around school choice and parental involvement. Jensen wants to add new layers of parental notification and input into what’s taught and what might be off limits; he says some lessons around race and culture go too far. His choice proposal would steer some dollars that would otherwise go to public schools into scholarships or accounts for families who want to pick a different learning option, including parochial schools. Jensen said creating more competition to public schools would force all schools to measure up to public expectations. He said school districts wouldn’t necessarily lose funding for all students who leave, but if they lost substantial enrollment it would point to something deeper.“I have no problem at all, with a given school district, finding itself one day with no students at all, because everybody left because everybody knew there was a problem and they were gonna get their kids educated,” Jensen said at a State Fair news conference. The Walz campaign questions the legality of such an arrangement but says the overall Jensen plan would further hamstring public schools. The year Walz took office, the state spent about $9.6 billion on early childhood through K-12 education. That’s due to exceed $10.4 billion for the current fiscal year — although a plan to add hundreds of millions of dollars more stalled in the Legislature. Walz said that should be just a start.Early fairgoers to the Minnesota State Fair were greeted by Gov. Tim Walz, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, and U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith while waiting for the gates to open.Ben Hovland | MPR News“I&#x27;ve said that we got more work to do,” he said in a recent interview with MPR News. “I would like to see us reform how we fund education — move away from these bonding referendums. I&#x27;d like to see us implement our Due North plan to get more teachers of color.”Walz has found himself increasingly on the defensive around education, in part due to new test scores that show a dropoff in math and reading proficiency. Republicans say it’s evidence that distance and hybrid learning the governor advocated during COVID-19 set many students back. “It&#x27;s not isolated to Minnesota. We know that a test is a moment in time,” Walz said in response. But, he added, “We certainly take it seriously.”Walz acknowledges some children are still catching up. But he also notes more parents than in the past decided against having their children tested so that might have affected the numbers. The percentage of students who didn’t take the test was slightly higher than normal, but not substantially more. Walz also found himself mopping up after a comment he made at the Fair about the number of days children lost to in-class learning. He told WCCO-TV last weekend that 80 percent of students missed less than 10 days of in-class instruction, without specifying a time period. His critics slammed him as misleading voters and minimizing the education disruption. “That is a barefaced lie,” Jensen said of the Walz remark. Walz said his comment was misconstrued but he later clarified that he was suggesting most schools returned to a more normal schedule last school year. Graduation rates have largely been static for Minnesota students overall under Walz’s watch. There was a small dip during the 2020-21 school year, which is the most recent for which data is available. Gaps between white students and those of color remain.Education is a hot issue in other races on the ballot. Of course, it’s the main topic in contests for 373 school board seats on November’s ballot. But it’s also likely to drive debate in competitive races for the state Legislature. Minnesota’s divided-control Legislature is viewed as an intense fight for party supremacy, with one or both majorities a real possibility to flip. Republicans have the Senate majority now and DFLers run the House. House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, expects education to be a prominent issue in swing-district races, particularly in the suburbs.“People know that there&#x27;s not enough staff in the schools right now. We have a shortage and part of that comes from under-investing in education,” she said. “And it&#x27;s a very high priority for Minnesota voters to invest in education so we can retain that kind of leadership post that Minnesota has historically had as being one of the best educated states.”House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Zimmerman, said crime and inflation come up more often in conversations with voters. But he said Republicans won’t shy from the debate over education — both who has the say over classroom curriculum and how money gets spent.“It’s policies that have emanated out of the power of the teachers union at the legislature to kind of hold Democrats to the line of the only answer is more money, that we can&#x27;t reform the way we&#x27;re educating these kids and give them maybe a creative solution that they need and deserve,” Daudt said. “So I think we do have a better position on these issues.”Education is also coming up in some races where it isn’t as present usually. Ryan Wilson, the Republican running for state auditor, said in a WCCO Radio debate last weekend that he’d use the office to examine where education dollars are going. “We&#x27;re hearing ‘Is the money making it to the schools?’ We&#x27;re happy to give more, some people say we give too much,” Wilson said. “But regardless, they want to know that once the money is there, is it making it to the classrooms so the teachers can teach and the kids can learn.”Blaha said the schools aren’t a bastion of waste.“You&#x27;re implying that schools aren&#x27;t using their money properly. It&#x27;s really important that we do not speculate on what&#x27;s going on. You know, it doesn&#x27;t matter what you think, it only matters what you know,” Blaha said in the debate with Wilson. “And if the auditor speculates you can cause real problems for schools who are trying to pass levies right now.”MPR News reporter Dana Ferguson contributed to this story",

        "description": "President Joe Biden travels to Philadelphia to deliver a speech about what the White House calls the &quot;battle for the soul of the nation&quot; outside Independence Hall. The speech comes two months before the midterm elections and as his travel schedule, especially to the battleground state of Pennsylvania, has ramped up.Billed as a major address just over two months before the midterm elections, Biden, the White House said, will discuss how the nation&#x27;s standing in the world and its democracy are at stake.Biden’s remarks set for 7 p.m. Central“He will talk about the progress we have made as a nation to protect our democracy, but how our rights and freedoms are still under attack,&quot; the White House said. &quot;And he will make clear who is fighting for those rights, fighting for those freedoms, and fighting for our democracy.”Biden has increasingly sought to portray the November elections as a choice for voters between “ultra-MAGA Republicans” — a reference to former President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan — and Democrats. He told supporters last week that they had “to vote to literally save democracy once again” — and labeled some Republican ideology as “semi-fascism.&quot;NBC News was first to report on Biden&#x27;s plans for the address.",

        "description": "Democrat Mary Peltola won the special election for Alaska’s only U.S. House seat on Wednesday, besting a field that included Republican Sarah Palin, who was seeking a political comeback in the state where she was once governor.Peltola, who is Yup’ik and turned 49 on Wednesday, will become the first Alaska Native to serve in the House and the first woman to hold the seat. She will serve the remaining months of the late Republican U.S. Rep. Don Young’s term. Young held the seat for 49 years before his death in March.“I don&#x27;t think there will be another birthday like today,” Peltola said.“Really I&#x27;m just so grateful to Alaskans and all the Alaskans who put their faith in me to fill out the remainder of Congressman Young&#x27;s term,” she said in an interview. “My desire is to follow in Congressman Young&#x27;s legacy of representing all Alaskans, and I&#x27;m just looking forward to getting to work.”Peltola’s victory, in Alaska’s first statewide ranked choice voting election, is a boon for Democrats, particularly coming off better-than-expected performances in special elections around the country this year following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade. She will be the first Democrat to hold the seat since the late U.S. Rep. Nick Begich, who was seeking reelection in 1972 when his plane disappeared. Begich was later declared dead and Young in 1973 was elected to the seat.Peltola ran as a coalition builder while her two Republican opponents — Palin and Begich’s grandson, also named Nick Begich — at times went after each other. Palin also railed against the ranked voting system, which was instituted by Alaska voters.All three — Peltola, Palin and Begich — are candidates in the November general election, seeking a two-year term that would start in January.The results came 15 days after the Aug. 16 election, in line with the deadline for state elections officials to receive absentee ballots mailed from outside the U.S. Ranked choice tabulations took place Wednesday after no candidate won more than 50% of the first choice votes, with state elections officials livestreaming the event. Peltola was in the lead heading into the tabulations, followed by Palin and then Begich.State elections officials plan to certify the election by Friday.Alaska Democratic Party leaders cheered Peltola&#x27;s win.“Alaskans have made clear they want a rational, steadfast, honest and caring voice speaking for them in Washington D.C., not opportunists and extremists associated with the Alaska Republican Party,&quot; state Democratic party chair Michael Wenstrup said in a statement.Wednesday’s results were a disappointment for Palin, who was looking to make a political comeback 14 years after she was vaulted onto the national stage when John McCain selected her to be his running mate in the 2008 presidential election. In her run for the House seat, she had widespread name recognition and won the endorsement of former President Donald Trump.After Peltola&#x27;s victory was announced, Palin called the ranked voting system “crazy, convoluted, confusing.” “Though we’re disappointed in this outcome, Alaskans know I’m the last one who’ll ever retreat,&quot; Palin said in a statement.Begich in a statement congratulated Peltola while looking forward to the November election.During the campaign, critics questioned Palin&#x27;s commitment to Alaska, citing her decision to resign as governor in July 2009, partway through her term. Palin went on to become a conservative commentator on TV and appeared in reality television programs, among other pursuits.Palin has insisted her commitment to Alaska never wavered and said ahead of the special election that she had “signed up for the long haul.”Peltola, a former state lawmaker who most recently worked for a commission whose goal is to rebuild salmon resources on the Kuskokwim River, cast herself as a “regular” Alaskan. “I’m not a millionaire. I’m not an international celebrity,” she said.Peltola has said she was hopeful that the new system would allow more moderate candidates to be elected.During the campaign, she emphasized her support of abortion rights and said she wanted to elevate issues of ocean productivity and food security. Peltola said she got a boost after the June special primary when she won endorsements from Democrats and independents who had been in the race. She said she believed her positive messaging also resonated with voters.“It’s been very attractive to a lot of people to have a message of working together and positivity and holding each other up and unity and as Americans none of us are each other’s enemy,” she said. “That is just a message that people really need to hear right now.”Alaska voters in 2020 approved an elections process that replaced party primaries with open primaries. Under the new system, ranked voting is used in general elections.Under ranked voting, ballots are counted in rounds. A candidate can win outright with more than 50% of the vote in the first round. If no one hits that threshold, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Voters who chose that candidate as their top pick have their votes count for their next choice. Rounds continue until two candidates remain, and whoever has the most votes wins.In Alaska, voters last backed a Democrat for president in 1964. The number of registered voters who are unaffiliated with a party is greater than the number of registered Republicans or Democrats combined, according to statistics from the Division of Elections.The last Democratic member of Alaska&#x27;s congressional delegation was Mark Begich, Nick Begich&#x27;s uncle, who served one term in the U.S. Senate and lost his 2014 reelection bid.Alaska&#x27;s U.S. senators, Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, congratulated Peltola.Murkowski said Peltola “has a long track record of public service to our great state.” Murkowski and Peltola were in the state Legislature together.",

        "description": "(Locomotion/Polydor Records)With his second album, the rising pop-punk star shoots for the mainstream yet remains a staunch defender of the disaffectedDominic “Yungblud” Harrison famously gives good interview. He talks passionately about hot-button issues: gender fluidity, transgender rights, mental health. He peppers his conversation with attention-grabbing, self-aggrandising soundbites: “I’m everything that people hate.” “I’m more of a preacher than I am a musician.” “I am a vehicle for other people’s expression.” He admonishes “BBC Radio 6 Music dads”, and hymns his fans as “an army based on a foundation of truth and need and trauma”. Among his most striking pronouncements was something he said to the Guardian in 2020: “If you know Yungblud” – Harrison has a habit of referring to his onstage persona in the third person – “the music is secondary.”It was a comment that Harrison’s detractors, whose number and vociferousness is perhaps an unavoidable consequence of saying things such as: “I’m more of a preacher than I am a musician” whenever a journalist is in earshot, leapt on with relish. Formerly an actor in Disney teen drama, The Lodge, Harrison has long been dogged by questions about his legitimacy as an avatar of punky rebellion. But you could take it as a frank assessment of pop success in an age in which social media engagement is deemed of paramount importance, or an admission that his fans, who call themselves the Black Hearts Club, are as attracted to him because of how he looks and what he says as much as how he sounds – which, as an analysis of how pop fandom works, seems fair enough.

        "description": "I started telling people what a terrific writer Brian Phillips is back in 2008, when he wasn’t yet even a gleam in Bill Simmons’s eye, and since then I’ve written for his old site The Run of Play, we’ve eaten lunch together in Harvard Square, and once we joined forces to confront an enraged lunatic photographer on Flickr. When you’ve been through the wars like that, it forms a bond, you know? So I’m as proud as a slightly obnoxious big brother to learn that he’s a fantastic podcaster too. \nI have enjoyed this whole series, but now that we’re at Dennis Bergkamp … well. My feelings about Dennis Bergkamp are strong. Watch the YouTube clips Brian has lined up there, and you’ll see why. \n\nI’m going to make one point about that goal against Argentina — the ostensible subject of Brian’s episode — and then a more general point. Brian describes the goal well: the long, long pass from Frank de Boer; Bergkamp’s leaping first touch that kills the ball; the subtle pullback from the right side of his body to the left that sends Roberto Ayala flying. But then there’s the shot itself. Bergkamp can’t take the time to shape his body to take a proper shot, with either foot; all he has time for is a toepoke, a quick insouciant flick of the ball that looks a little like a dancer doing the can-can. And yet the ball just arrows into the roof of the net. The first touch and the pullback came from masterful technical skill; that shot from sheer imagination. \nThus my more general point: As Brian hints, Bergkamp’s distinctive style of play was simply made for YouTube, because all of Bergkamp’s greatest plays leave you saying, Wait … what? What did I just see? Let me rewind that. \nConsider the two examples Brian gives near the end of that post (which transcribes the episode). On that assist to Freddie Ljungberg vs. Juventus the commentator doesn’t even mention the pass, because I don’t think he has any idea what has just happened. And to be fair, it’s almost impossible to see on a first viewing. You have to run it back and look again, because it’s that imagination again, that Bergkampian sublime. If you’re commenting on the match you just end up saying “Terrific goal from Ljungberg!” or the like — because the actual finish is something that happened in the world of space-time as we know it. The pass, by contrast, happens somewhere else. \nThe famous Newcastle goal is even weirder. I’ve seen it a hundred times, and every time I see it I say, “Wait … what?” What precisely did he just do? Also, how did he ever think of that? “Ah, when the ball gets to me I’ll just flick it to my right and behind me, while simultaneously pivoting to my left, so that the ball and I will meet in an enveloping pincer movement that will leave the defender and keeper helpless!” As Brian says: Ladies and gentlemen, Dennis Bergkamp! \nBut I want to look at one more, this one: \n\n\n\nAgain, the perfect first touch, followed by a little private game of keepy-uppy, and then the clinical finish. But what I love most about this is the reaction of the defender, who had been right there, who had been in perfect position, who had done his job … and yet look at what happened. As the ball goes into the net his hands fly up to his head: “Wait … what??” ",

Republicans had a five-point advantage in March.”\n\n\n\n“The Democratic gains come from increased support among independents, women and younger voters. Black and Hispanic voters, who have traditionally favored Democrats heavily, are also more solidly supportive of the party than they were earlier this year.”\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, FiveThirtyEight gives Democrats a 68% chance to win the Senate and gives Republicans a 76% chance to win the House.",

It&#8217;s also why Republicans no longer feel so confident of a landslide in the House.”\n\n\n\nKarl Rove: “This is shifting the midterms from being a referendum on Mr. Biden’s failures to a comparison between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump, which diminishes the Republican advantage.”",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3620690-are-russians-collectively-guilty-of-the-regimes-crimes/",
        "description": "Recent talk of travel restrictions for all Russians has produced a debate about the morality of such a step. Is it right for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s opponents to be lumped together with Putin’s supporters? Isn’t a blanket prohibition unjust?\n\n\n\nThe answer is that it depends on whether Russians do or do not collectively share some trait that would warrant such a punitive measure. Obviously, it can’t be the mere fact of being Russian or speaking Russian or living in Russia.\n\n\n\nThe only trait that could justify collective opprobrium would have to be behavioral. If all Russians acted in a manner that enabled, promoted or directly caused the Putin regime’s crimes, then all Russians would be guilty or responsible collectively for those crimes.\n\n\n\nSergey Radchenko, the Wilson E. Schmidt Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, has argued that Russians aren’t collectively responsible for any crimes: “There are many Russians who shamefully support Putin’s hideous aggression in Ukraine — directly, by waging war, and indirectly, for example by refusing to condemn Russia, or by maintaining false detachment as if the war is no concern of theirs. I will judge them individually, and let myself be judged, too, but only to the extent that they and I are personally responsible for specific crimes and misdeeds.”\n\n\n\nSignificantly, he insists that collective responsibility or guilt is a totalitarian notion (tell that to Alexander the Great when he razed cities), thereby overlooking the inconvenient fact that the Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung, the German theologian Martin Niemöller, and the German philosopher Karl Jaspers all spoke of German collective guilt for Nazi crimes. They may have been wrong to do so, but their anti-Nazi and anti-totalitarian credentials are impeccable.\n\n\n\nIn fact, while the notion of collective guilt is no longer accepted by most Germans, they do acknowledge that they share a collective responsibility for Adolf Hitler’s crimes. As a leading German politician recently put it: “Our collective responsibility remains. It extends to future generations and to Germans whose families came to Germany after National Socialism.”\n\n\n\nIn sum, if the Germans could have felt collectively guilty, or still feel collectively responsible for Hitler’s crimes, so, too, can the Russians. They may have participated directly in killing innocent Ukrainians (or Georgians or Chechens or Crimean Tatars …) or they may have supported the killing of these people. Support could be expressed publicly, as in taking part in pro-regime demonstrations, voting for Putin, or smearing a “Z” on some wall, or it could be expressed privately, as in feeling pleasure that Crimea is “ours” again, lauding Putin for making Russia great, or failing to express outrage at the regime’s crimes. This last action — or, rather, the absence thereof — is important. One can become complicit in a crime by perpetrating it, supporting it, or failing to condemn it. Commission of crimes is punishable by law. Supporting or failing to condemn them is not illegal, but it is immoral.\n\n\n\nOf course, the mere fact that individual Russians may be morally complicit in crimes does not yet translate into collective guilt or collective responsibility. Numbers matter, as do sustained patterns of behavior. Germans overwhelmingly supported the Hitler regime and overwhelmingly failed to condemn its actions between 1933, when Hitler came to power, and 1945, when World War II ended and the Nazi regime collapsed. To be sure, the Nazi repressive apparatus was efficient and terrifying. Although the very real possibility of being arrested for some minor protest affected what Germans could or could not have done under Hitler’s regime, we still regard them as collectively having “fallen.”\n\n\n\nPutin and his criminal regime have enjoyed fantastic levels of support in Russia for the past two decades. His popularity has often approached 90 percent and usually remains in the 60-80 percent range. Russians cheered when he violated international law, invaded the Donbas, and annexed Crimea in 2014. The war against Ukraine provoked some initial demonstrations and mass flight from Russia, but Putin’s popularity remains distressingly high even as thousands of Russians are losing their lives in Ukraine. Many Russians openly support the looting, killing, raping and, ultimately, genocide in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nIf 100 percent of all Russians must be guilty of some action in order for their guilt or responsibility to be deemed collective, then Russians cannot be collectively guilty or responsible. But neither can Germans. If we loosen the requirement and substitute “an overwhelming majority” for 100 percent, then collective guilt or responsibility becomes plausible.\n\n\n\nWhat, then, should Russians do? A courageous Russian soldier, Pavel Filatyev, who recently published a scathing critique of the war and regime, has an answer. He’s opposed to apologizing to Ukrainians. One apologizes “when one steps on someone’s foot. At the moment, to say ‘excuse me’ is insufficient.”\n\n\n\nWhat would be sufficient? The international community and the Hague will have to decide that. In the meantime, Russians could help their cause by expressing collective shame and outrage at the Putin regime’s genocidal behavior. Both shame and outrage entail no risk and can be expressed easily by an overwhelming majority. They won’t end Putin’s regime, but they’d be a start toward Russia’s moral regeneration.\n\n\n\nAlexander J. Motyl is a professor of political science at Rutgers University-Newark.

        "description": "College football revelry will be in full swing on Saturday when teams kick off the 2022 season, but there’s one tradition that needs to end — the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s (NCAA) insistence that its players are amateurs. Players are now free to earn money from their name, image and likeness (NIL) contracts but NCAA policies are preventing them from realizing their full market potential. Federal policymakers should resist calls to legislate these misguided rules and the NCAA should embrace the free market instead.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith annual revenues exceeding $18.7 billion, college sports are big business. Power Five schools alone — the 69 programs competing in the NCAA’s most prestigious conferences — rake in about $8.3 billion each year from various sources, such as the Big 10’s new seven-year media deal valued at $1.2 billion annually.\n\n\n\nBut players receive nothing in the form of wages, despite the fact that the average economic value of a Power Five football player is estimated to be $1.3 million over a four-year collegiate career. That’s because the NCAA has long held that its athletes are amateurs, not professionals, strictly forbidding most forms of compensation and threatening players and programs with harsh penalties for violating its bylaws. \n\n\n\nThis model was dealt a blow in last year’s NCAA v. Alston decision, when Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion raised antitrust concerns, observing, “The NCAA’s business model would be flatly illegal in almost any other industry in America.” While the unanimous decision was limited in scope, finding the NCAA can’t limit education-related payments to athletes, Kavanaugh warned of an “overdue course correction.” \n\n\n\nThe Alston decision pushed the NCAA to establish a temporary NIL policy and at least 28 states have passed laws enshrining collegiate athletes’ rights to earn NIL compensation so they can pursue endorsement deals, autograph sales, and other money-making ventures that were previously banned by the NCAA. But the NCAA’s interim NIL policy and guidance clings to its amateurism fairy tale, making it difficult for players to get the best deals possible. \n\n\n\nNotably, the NCAA still prohibits recruits from communicating with third-party boosters, and NIL agreements can’t be tied to enrollment at a particular institution. This makes it hard to shop around for the best deal and has resulted in one-sided contracts with unfavorable terms for athletes, according to reports by The Athletic. Under the rules, deals must be based on the value each player brings to an NIL agreement, meaning they can’t get extra money just because they’re the star quarterback or a heralded recruit.\n\n\n\nThe NCAA, it seems, is hell-bent on capping how much players can earn from NIL, claiming the rules promote competitive balance by putting schools on an even playing field for recruits. But considering donations account for 24 percent of Power Five college athletic revenues, it’s more likely they just don’t want competition for this $2 billion funding pie that helps fund elaborate facilities, multimillion-dollar salaries, and expanding bureaucracies. \n\n\n\nFor example, the University of Alabama is making $600 million in upgrades to its athletics facilities and recently awarded Nick Saban with a $93.6 million contract. While boosters have plenty of cash to throw around, NIL deals could eat into athletic department budgets, threatening their lavish status quo.   \n\n\n\nBut the NCAA knows its rules may be on shaky legal grounds, which is why they’re lobbying Congress for a federal policy that would preserve their monopoly. Ultimately, they’re seeking an antitrust exemption to prevent an onslaught of lawsuits once they start enforcing NIL restrictions with sanctions and other penalties. \n\n\n\nFor anyone who spends their fall Saturdays watching football, inviting the likes of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to regulate college sports is a recipe for disaster. Americans need less — not more — politics in their lives. But more importantly, federal legislation likely would codify an unjust system that shortchanges players to the benefit of the NCAA and its 1,100 member colleges and universities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRather than looking to Washington for solutions, the NCAA should embrace the free market by letting boosters and players agree to whatever financial terms work best for them. This is how the rest of society organizes itself and collegiate athletes should be no different.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAaron Smith is the director of education policy at Reason Foundation.

The UK announced a £15bn package in May, largely in the form of cash payments to households, while EU member states are estimated to have spent €280bn (£243m) over the past year on everything from subsidies and price caps to one-off payments. But bills for households and businesses are reaching unsustainable levels, with further increases expected next year, sharpening the debate over whether ministers should be intervening directly in energy markets to help bring prices down.As Russia threatens to further reduce gas supplies, politicians in Italy, Spain, Greece and the Czech Republic are among those pushing for coordinated action. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Monday Brussels was considering measures to be adopted by the 27 member states. What are the options? Continue reading...",

It is the fifth installment and is a prequel to the first four films, being set in the Northern Great Plains in North America in 1719. The film is directed by Dan Trachtenberg and written by Patrick Aison. It stars Amber Midthunder, Dakota Beavers, Michelle Thrush, Stormee Kipp, Julian Black Antelope, Bennett Taylor, and Dane DiLiegro. The story revolves around Naru, a skilled Comanche warrior, who is striving to prove herself as a hunter. She finds herself having to protect her people from a vicious, humanoid alien that hunts humans for sport, as well as from French fur traders who are attacking her people and destroying the Buffalo they rely on for survival.\n\nAlthough there were elements that seemed a little far-fetched, I enjoyed this addition to the Predator franchise, especially the heroine. I also liked the comparison between the predator and the colonisers. The post 📺 Prey first appeared on Read Write Collect.",

        "description": "Dan Brink\n    \n\n  Judge stood still last night to close out August at 51 homers. Welcome back to the Aaron Judge Home Run Record Tracker! We’re taking a daily look at where Aaron Judge’s monster season tracks compared to some of the other historic single-season home run leaders in anticipation of Judge potentially joining their ranks. We’ll be going by Team Game because not every player’s seasons were in sync with the calendar days and everyone didn’t play all of the team’s games, which makes this our universal standard. Now, for Game 131:\nAaron Judge through Game 131 of 2022: 51 HR\nTeam Game 131: 8/31 — 0-for-2, 2 BB, 2 K, 1 SB\nIt was probably asking for too much to see Judge hit a home run in three straight games, but you never know with a slugger this good. Alas, Judge did not manage to do so, working a couple of walks and stealing a base in the ninth inning instead. Judge was the tying run in that instance, but the Yankees couldn’t do anything after he got to second base and dropped another nail-biter.\nRoger Maris through Game 131 of 1961: 51 HR\nTeam Game 131: 8/29 — 0-for-3, 1 BB\nThe main foil to our big man’s chase, Maris had a quiet night here much like the rest of the ‘61 Yankees. The Twins’ Camilo Pascual managed to pitch a complete game shutout against them, and he got Maris out three times, conceding just a walk to him in the seventh inning.\nBabe Ruth through Game 131 of 1927: 44 HR\nTeam Game 131: 9/5 (2) — 0-for-3, 1 K\nA few hours prior, the Yankees and Red Sox played in an 18-inning barnburner. Naturally they had to play a doubleheader after that, but this one only lasted five innings. Call it mercy after a grueling beginning to their day, but the Yankees jumped out early and easily won this one. Unfortunately, Ruth was a non-factor in this game as well, failing to get on base.\nBarry Bonds through Game 131 of 2001: 56 HR\nTeam Game 131: 8/27 — 3-for-4, 1 HR, 1 RBI, 2 R, 1 BB\nBonds is the lone mover on our list here at this point in the season, mashing his 56th homer of the year in the fifth inning off of the Mets’ Kevin Appier. Bonds’ solo shot was a back-to-back blast with Rich Aurilia that propelled the Giants from a 1-1 tie to a 3-1 lead. Every run counted in this one, as the Giants gave the lead away in the bottom of that same inning and ultimately squeaked out a 6-5 win.\n\nMark McGwire through Game 131 of 1998: 53 HR\nTeam Game 131: 8/24 — did not play\nNothing to report on McGwire from this one, as he sat in a game that wouldn’t be completed between the Cardinals and Pirates.\nSammy Sosa through Game 131 of 1998: 51 HR\nTeam Game 131: 8/24 — 2-for-4, 1 K\nWith his rival sitting out his game, Sosa had a chance to make up some ground against the Astros. Unfortunately for him, though he would get a pair of hits neither left the yard or did much to contribute in cutting into Houston’s massive lead in this game. The Cubs couldn’t recover after Mark Clark could only make it two innings, and the Astros easily took the bout 12-3.",

The short answer is: in hot water. The longer answer is: He is confronting yet again the federal law enforcement and intelligence communities for which he has rightly expressed such public disdain.

        "description": "Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Colorado Rockies news and links for Thursday, September 1st, 2022   As they entered last night’s game against the Atlanta Braves, the Colorado Rockies were tied for the best team batting average in all of Major League Baseball. With a team average of .262, only the juggernaut Los Angeles Dodgers were keeping pace. However, there is a vast canyon of difference between the two teams. The Los Angeles Dodgers are 90-38 and are basically guaranteed the NL West crown. The Rockies are 56-74 and are quite comfortably in the basement.\nIf the Rockies and Dodgers have the same team batting average, and both teams are getting base hits at roughly the same pace—the Rockies have 1170 hits in 4470 at-bats, the Dodgers have 1149 in 4382—why are the two teams so far apart?\nBatting average is a relatively empty stat on it’s own. It’s meaningless without context, and worthless if you’re not doing something with all those hits. The Colorado Rockies’ offense is broken. There’s no getting around that. While they have a strong batting average they suffer in basically every other meaningful offensive category. As the Rockies cruise towards the end of one of their worst records in franchise history, they are putting up one of the worst—if not the worst—full season offense in franchise history to go along with it.\n\nThe Rockies are currently putting up their worst or second worst standard batting statistics in a full regular season, excluding the shortened 2020 campaign. Of the three categories they aren’t worst or second worst, two are still in the bottom five. Contextually even the Rockies .262 team batting average isn’t particularly good. It’s the fifth worst mark in franchise history and is only good in the context of decreasing batting averages throughout the league. The Dodgers’ matching .262 is fairly middle-of-the-road in their own franchise history.\nWhile the Rockies are—respective to other teams—getting plenty of hits, they just aren’t doing anything with them. Runners aren’t a threat on the bases because the Rockies have stolen just 36 this season. Batters aren’t a threat with runners on because the Rockies have the second fewest RsBI in team history. The Rockies are scoring the second fewest runs per game in the history of the franchise. \nThe Rockies have shown diminishing returns on offense for the last five seasons.  Three of the worst five Rockies seasons for AVG, OBP, and SLG have come within the last five seasons. Things are coming to a head here in 2022 with the newest feature of a struggling offense: power drain. For a team with the reputation of thriving in a hitter’s paradise, the Rockies just aren’t slugging at all. With some of the worst power numbers in franchise history, including a worst ever slugging percentage, the Rockies are likely to finish the season with the fewest home runs in 28 full seasons. They need 12 more in the final month of play to avoid this fate.\nUnlike other standard marks, the Rockies hadn’t actually struggled much with the long ball in recent memory until this season. They actually hit a second-best 224 in 2019, and their five worst home run seasons before this year all came before 2007. However, the Rockies’ home run production has fallen off a cliff in 2022. Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees has almost half as many home runs individually (51) as the Rockies have as a team. \n\nNot coincidentally, the Rockies are also hitting a lot of ground balls. The Rockies’ current GB% of 46.9 is the highest in franchise history and the highest in the league at time of writing. They are also hitting into the second most double plays in the league, jockeying for the lead with the Washington Nationals.\nAfter a high GB% in 2018, the Rockies’ ground ball rate improved dramatically in 2019 with their third lowest GB% over a full season. In 2021 the team’s ground ball rate surged, and it has taken another alarming jump here in 2022. The Rockies current FB% and LD% are fourth worst and sixth worst in franchise history, respectively.\nVirtually every Rockies batter is hitting the ball into the dirt 40% or more of the time. Of all regular players, only Elehuris Montero, Kris Bryant, and CJ Cron are currently below that threshold. Kris Bryant only played 42 games this season.\nAt the end of last season I discussed how Raimel Tapia had a ground ball problem. Now that problem has spread to the whole team. The Rockies traded Tapia to the Toronto Blue Jays in the spring for fly ball power bat Randal Grichuk... who is currently on pace for his fewest home runs since his rookie season and is suffering from a career worst 52.3% ground ball rate. Meanwhile Tapia’s 50.6% ground ball rate is his lowest since 2019 and can potentially reach the career high nine home runs he hit that season. It would appear that Tapia didn’t have a ground ball problem, but rather a Colorado Rockies problem.\nThe Rockies’ offense isn’t just bad, it’s broken. Systematically and categorically. The Rockies need to find a successful hitting philosophy by any means possible. Be it parting ways with hitting coach Dave Magadan, a dramatic increase in research and analytics, or ideally both, it’s clear the Rockies need to figure out how to right the ship soon. The team’s 30th anniversary looms in the distance after four straight losing seasons.\n★ ★ ★\n\nToglia’s first MLB home run ‘pretty special’ | MLB.com\n\nLet’s balance out the negative with a bit of positive. Rockies top first base prospect Michael Toglia (no. 11 PuRP) hit his first big league home run in last night’s loss to the Braves. Toglia, who also earned his first MLB hit last night, struck the blow against longtime foe and current Braves closer Kenley Jansen. The ball just squeaked over the outfield wall.\n“Going around second, I knew it — I looked up at my family and saw them hugging,” Toglia said following the game. \n★ ★ ★\nOn The Farm\nTriple-A: Sugar Land Space Cowboys 8, Albuquerque Isotopes 6\nIsotopes starter Brandon Gold lasted just three innings against the Space Cowboys while giving up six earned runs on seven hits and four walks. He gave up a home run in the first inning and failed to strike out a single batter. Ty Blach was credited with the loss while giving up one earned run on three hits and a walk over 2 1⁄3 innings. Blach struck out three batters . JD Hammer gave up a solo home run as one of two hits in his 1 2⁄3 innings of work. Zach Lee was the only Isotopes pitcher to not allow an earned run. Offensively, the Isotopes scored six runs on nine hits, while also drawing seven walks. They had plenty of opportunities to score, but went just 6-for-19 with RISP. Dom Nuñez and Sam Hilliard both had multi-hit games while Nuñez and Wynton Bernard both plated two RsBI. The Isotopes’ best scoring inning came in the top of the fourth, when they tied the Space Cowboys 6-6 with a three run inning. Unfortunately the Space Cowboys retook the lead in the bottom of the frame and never looked back.\n\n\nAll tied up thanks to this @SamHilliard22 knock! A three-fun fourth for your Topes.M4: Isotopes 6, Space Cowboys 6 pic.twitter.com/215SK4UtGM— Albuquerque Isotopes (@ABQTopes) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nDouble-A: Hartford Yard Goats 7, Reading Fightin Phils 5\nMitchell Kilkenny gave up four runs on nine hits during his six inning start for the Yard Goats while striking out only one batter. Austin Kitchen gave up a solo home run in the seventh inning to lose the lead in 2⁄3 of an inning. Blair Calvo was credited with the win while striking out three batters and giving up just one hit over 2 1⁄3 scoreless innings of work. It’s Calvo’s fourth win of the season. The Yard Goats scored seven runs on eight hits with three multi hit nights. Grant Lavigne, Brenton Doyle, and Willie MacIver all went 2-for-4, with Doyle and Julio Carreras also driving in two runs each. Doyle struck a two-run home run in the bottom of the fifth, his 18th of the season, while Grant Lavigne hit his fourth via a solo shot in the seventh. \n\n\nBRENTON DOYLE 2 RUN HOME RUN FOR THE LEAD! @BrentonDoyle7 pic.twitter.com/uHA3kn2hS5— Hartford Yard Goats (@GoYardGoats) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nHigh-A Game 1: Vancouver Canadians 6, Spokane Indians 4\nThe Spokane Indians dropped game one of their double header 6-4 with starting pitcher Joe Rock allowing all six of those runs across his 4 2⁄3 innings of work. Rock gave up six hits—including a home run—and walked four batters. Anderson Pilar pitched the final 2 1⁄3 innings while striking out two batters and giving up one hit. Catcher Hunter Goodman went 2-for-3 with a double and scored twice, while Colin Simpson went 3-for-3 with three RsBI and a home run in the second inning. Mateo GIl also had a 2-for-3 day.\nHigh-A Game 2: Vancouver Canadians 5, Spokane Indians 4\nNo multi-hit games were had in the second game of the Indians’ double header, but the Indians did score four runs on six hits. Yorvis Torrealba—freshly promoted from Low-A—had a hit and scored. Eddy Diaz plated two of the Indians’ four runs with a double in the third inning. Reliever Anderson Amarista had the start for Spokane and pitched four innings and allowed four runs (three earned). He gave up four hits, including two home runs, and had two walks and strikeouts apiece. Adam McKillican pitched two innings while giving up one earned run on three hits and a walk.\nLow-A: Fresno Grizzlies 15, Modesto Nuts 8\nFor their 20th win in the month of August, the Fresno Grizzlies scored 15 runs at Chukchansi Park to outpace the Modesto Nuts. Starting pitcher Cullen Kafka was having a very strong start until disaster struck late in his outing. Through his first five frames, Kafka gave up just just two runs while striking out five batters. Things fell apart in the sixth, where he gave up six straight base hits and got dinged for six runs with one out. Tyler Ras finished the sixth but did allow two inherited runners to score. Ever Moya and Sergio Sanchez pitched the final three innings without allowing a run, and Sanchez struck out five in his two innings of work. Offensively, Benny Montgomery, AJ Lewis, and Yanquiel Fernandez were the stars of the show. Montgomery went 4-for-5 with four RsBI, a home run, and a double. Fernandez went 3-for-5 with three RsBI and a home run of his own. The Montgomery and Fernandez home runs came back-to-back as part of a six run seventh inning for the Grizzlies. AJ Lewis also went 3-for-5 with a home run coming in the fourth inning and a team-leading five RsBI. Jordan Beck enjoyed a 2-for-4 night and scored a run while Juan Guerrero was 2-for-4 with an RBI and scored twice. The only starter to not have a hit was Juan Brito. The Grizzlies put up ten combined runs in the sixth and seventh, batting around the order in both innings.\n\n\nBenny Montgomery racked up career highs for the @FresnoGrizzlies:4 H ✔️4 RBIs ✔️5 times on base ✔️The @Rockies' No. 6 prospect also swatted his fifth roundtripper of the season as the cherry on top: https://t.co/vTF9LjMuBe pic.twitter.com/ujlK6LGV7M— MLB Pipeline (@MLBPipeline) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\n★ ★ ★\nPlease keep in mind our Purple Row Community Guidelines when you’re commenting.

        "description": "Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Do you call it fall or autumn? And does it begin today? Anne Rogers writes about Nick Pratto’s big night in Tuesday’s victory:\n\n“It’s definitely a feeling of confidence, knowing that I can trust the work I’ve done and trust the homework and everything,” said Pratto, ranked by MLB Pipeline as the Royals’ No. 2 prospect. “Continuing to do that and dominating my process before the game.”\nPratto’s process has been key to his surge, even throughout his slump. That’s what’s been most encouraging for the Royals to see from the 23-year-old.\n“He had a plan on what he was trying to do, what he was seeing each day that wasn’t working and what he needed to do to make an adjustment,” manager Mike Matheny said. “If he can continue to do that and stay in that positive state of mind when things start heading in a tough direction … I think it leads you to being able to have a night like tonight.”\n\nDavid Lesky at Inside the Crown broke down the good and the bad from Tuesday’s victory.\nLet’s start with the good. Pratto got that double on Friday night to snap an 0 for 21 stretch and now he’s only 8 for his last 17 with three home runs, four doubles and 10 RBI. Of course, a lot of that is that he was 4 for 5 last night with his first multi-homer game and an additional double. He was the 23rd player in franchise history to have a game with at least 11 total bases and it was the 28th time it had happened. Only two other instances were completed by rookies - Kevin Seitzer and Kila Ka’aihue - so it was a pretty special night for the young first baseman.\nKiley McDaniel ranks all 30 teams’ “core.” ($) Kansas City checks in at a lowly 27th:\nSomewhat similar to the Nationals, the Royals’ core here is basically just the last few years of the top of their good-not-great prospect list. Witt is the cornerstone, and I think Pasquantino is a keeper. A few others may get to that level, but this is simply not enough to show for being bad five straight years. There are not many sleepers that took a giant step forward in the last few years, while only Salvador Perez is left from the better clubs of yesteryear.\nGavin Cross is doin’ the damn thing:\n\n\nGAVIN CROSS.

        "description": "Photo by Rich Schultz/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Braves Franchise History \n1931: Giants rookie Jim Mooney notches his fourth win since being called up three weeks ago‚ beating the Braves, 4-0. It is his second shutout.\n1933: In the first of two games with the Braves‚ Carl Hubbell pitches 10 innings and drives in the winning run for a 2-0 win. He doesn’t walk a batter and never goes as deep as a 3-2 count on any hitter‚ holding the Braves to just four hits. It is his 20th win and his 10th shutout of the year. Five of the shutouts are 1-0‚ a National League record. Fred Frankhouse is the hard-luck loser‚ when his mates make two errors in the 10th. New York then takes the night game 5-3.\n1941: In the first of two this Labor Day‚ Dolph Camilli hits the 200th home run of his career against the Braves to send the game into extra innings. Camilli then gives the Dodgers a 6-5 victory in the 15th inning with his fifth hit of the game. Camilli’s 29th homer of the year ties the game in the eighth‚ his double in the 10th with two on keeps the Dodgers alive‚ and a two-out single in the 15th wins the game. Game 2 is cut short at 2-2 with Al Javery on the mound for Boston; he’ll get no rest tomorrow as he is the loser in a 9-2 Brooklyn win.\n1947: Jack Lohrke hits a homer against the Braves‚ number 183 for the season for the Giants‚ breaking the major league record held by the 1936 Yankees. Mel Ott’s club had hit five home runs in a doubleheader against the Cubs on August 24th to break Chicago’s 1929 NL record. The Giants will finish with 221 homers‚ led by Johnny Mize‚ Walker Cooper‚ Willard Marshall‚ and rookie Bobby Thomson.\n1948: The host Braves split a pair with the Reds‚ as Johnny Vander Meer bests Warren Spahn‚ 3-1, in the opener. Glenn Elliott‚ just up from the Triple A‚ is awarded the victory in the 11-1 nitecap‚ even though he pitches just three innings. Elliott collides with Ted Kluszewski while running to first base and is injured after pitching his only innings of the season. Reliever Clyde Shoun throws the last six innings.\n1956: Sparked by Warren Spahn’s two-hit pitching and the clutch hitting of Joe Adcock‚ the Braves beat the Cards‚ 3-1. Adcock knocks in all three runs in the victory. Despite the win‚ the Braves’ lead is cut to 2 games as the Dodgers sweep a pair from the Giants.\n1965: Cincinnati sweeps the Braves 7-6 and 2-0 to regain first place.\n1999: Atlanta gets a three-run home run from Brian Hunter and a two-run homer from Bret Boone to edge the Reds‚ 8-7. Bret’s brother Aaron homers for the Reds‚ as does Sean Casey as Cincinnati loses for the eighth time in nine meetings with Atlanta. Their victory two days before ended the Braves 10-game win streak.\n2004: Ryan Howard makes his major league debut as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies. In his first plate appearance, as a pinch hitter for pitcher Vicente Padilla, he strikes out against Atlanta Braves pitcher Jaret Wright.\n2020 Marcell Ozuna also has a good night for the Braves, becoming the first National League player to have a three-homer game at Fenway Park. Atlanta defeats the Red Sox, 10-3. The second homer is also the 1,000th career hit for Ozuna.\nMLB History \n1963: Curt Simmons of the Cardinals drives in a run with a triple in the second and then steals home on an aborted squeeze play. He also knocks in another run and beats the Phillies 7-3. Simmons‚ who in his 20-year career will steal just two bases‚ is on third base when a squeeze play goes awry‚ and beats a wide throw home from P Chris Short. It is the last steal of home by a pitcher until 1983‚ and just the fourth in the National League in the last 40 years. Harry Dorish in 1950 stole home‚ the last time an American League pitcher did pull off a theft.\n1967: Cincinnati’s Bob Lee walks Dick Groat with the bases loaded in the 21st inning to give the Giants a 1-0 victory at Crosley Field. Twenty scoreless innings tie the major league mark set by the Pirates and the Braves on August 1‚ 1918‚ a game Pittsburgh also won in the 21st. Gaylord Perry‚ with nine one-run losses during the season‚ pitches the first 16 innings of shutout ball‚ with Frank Linzy going the last five. Mel Queen tosses 9 1/3 innings for the Reds.\n1975: Mets ace Tom Seaver shuts out the Pirates, 3-0, and reaches 200 strikeouts for a major league-record eighth straight season.\n1997: The Reds lose to the Royals‚ 7-4‚ as Pete Rose Jr.‚ son of the all-time hit leader‚ makes his major league debut. After striking out in his first time up‚ Rose singles in his next at bat and finishes 1-for-3. The debut prompts walk-up sales of 15‚000.\n2007: Clay Buchholz of the Boston Red Sox pitches a 10-0 no-hitter over the Baltimore Orioles in his second career start. He is the first pitcher to throw a no-hitter in his first or second start since Wilson Alvarez did so in 1991.\n2008: Cliff Lee beats the Pale Hose, 5-0, to become the first 20-game winner for the Cleveland Indians in 34 years; Gaylord Perry had done it most recently. No franchise had gone longer without a 20-game winner.\n\nInformation for this article was found via Baseball Reference, NationalPastime.com and Today in Baseball History.",

        "description": "Photo by Adam Hunger/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Jordan Westburg homered again, Mike Baumann was electrifying, Cade Povich impressed, and the Bowie lineup went off. Triple-A: Norfolk Tides 4, Lehigh Valley IronPigs (Phillies) 1\nThe post-GUNNAR era began at Harbor Park. Fortunately for the Tides, they still have Jordan Westburg! The second baseman hit his 13th home run of the season, walked three times, and scored thrice as well. He probably won’t be getting a big league call this year, but not without a fight. Joey Ortiz added two singles, and Jacob Nottingham and Richie Martin both doubled.\n\n\nHome run #22 for Jordan Westburg pic.twitter.com/7XAC9R11CL— The Verge- An Orioles MiLB Podcast (@BSLOnTheVerge) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nMike Baumann could see himself get a September call if the Orioles value his length out of the bullpen. The righty tossed six innings without allowing an earned run, striking out 13 (!) in the process. The bullpen was terrific behind him as Yennier Cano, Louis Head, and Cole Uvila combined for three shutout frames and five strikeouts.\n\n\nOn The Verge #BabyBird of the day for August 31st:Norfolk Tides RHP Mike Baumann: 6 IP, 4 H, 0 ER, 0 BB, 13 KLast 2 starts: 11 IP, 0 ER, 1 BB, 17 K pic.twitter.com/B5dQ1UZoyS— The Verge- An Orioles MiLB Podcast (@BSLOnTheVerge) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nDouble-A: Bowie Baysox 15, Erie SeaWolves (Tigers) 5\nCade Povich put forth his best effort at Double-A so far. Over six innings the former Twins prospect allowed just one run on three hits, a walk, and six strikeouts. His relievers weren’t as effective. Tyler Burch served up a solo homer in his inning of work, and then Griffin McLarty allowed three runs on three hits and two walks across a pair of frames.\n\n\nCade Povich tonight:6 IP, 3 H, 1 R, 1 BB, 6 KNasty pic.twitter.com/ghS6IBtyU3— The Verge- An Orioles MiLB Podcast (@BSLOnTheVerge) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Bowie offense beat up on the Erie pitching staff, scoring 15 runs on 20 hits. Cody Roberts led the way with four hits, including a double. Toby Welk, Coby Mayo, and Cesar Prieto each had three hits. Welk had the biggest day of anyone, smacking two doubles and a home run. Hudson Haskin added a three-run dong. Darell Hernaiz contributed two hits and a stolen base.\n\n\n14th home run of the year for Hudson Haskin and the announcer is done with everything. pic.twitter.com/SBN2wEWXqn— The Verge- An Orioles MiLB Podcast (@BSLOnTheVerge) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nHigh-A: Aberdeen IronBirds 8, Hickory Crawdads (Rangers) 1, Aberdeen IronBirds 0 - Game 1\nThere’s not much to say when an offense gets just one hit. A single from TT Bowens was their long base knock. Donta’ Williams walked twice, and Heston Kjerstad worked another base on balls. That was the extent of the base runners. Aberdeen actually had four chances with runners in scoring position, all in the fourth inning. Bowens singled to load the bases, but then a pair of strikeouts and a fly out ended the threat.\nThe positive is that the IronBirds pitchers were great. Jean Pinto allowed just one run over five innings, and that one run was a solo homer. The righty was in control all game. Alex Pham followed and struck out three over his two innings.\nHigh-A: Aberdeen IronBirds 8, Hickory Crawdads (Rangers) 1 - Game 2\nAberdeen’s offense found itself in Game 2. Billy Cook jump started the lineup with a double and a triple, scoring twice. Kjerstad also had two hits, including his second triple of the year. Cook, Trendon Craig, Connor Pavolony, and Chris Givin swiped a base each. Jud Fabian was 0-for-2 with two walks and two strikeouts. The outfielder is still in pursuit of his first Double-A hit.\nAntonio Velez started on the bump and went four innings. The lefty allowed four runs but only one was earned thanks to a pair of Luis Valdez errors. Connor Gillispie nabbed the win for his three innings of work in which he allowed one run and struck out three.\nLow-A: Fredericksburg Nationals 12, Delmarva Shorebirds 8\nThis is the Delmarva recap, so you can be pretty sure that the pitching portion is rough. That was true again on Wednesday. They needed five pitchers to get through eight innings. The standout of the bunch was starter Juan Nunez. The 21-year-old tossed three scoreless innings, using two strikeouts to dance around two hits and two walks. His season ERA is down to 1.69 over 10.2 innings at the level.\nThere was some good stuff in the lineup, though. Dylan Beavers went 3-for-5 with two RBI, a double, and a stolen base. Creed Willems added a pair of hits, including a double. Jackson Holliday, starting at second base, had a two-hit day, although he also struck out twice, made an error, and was thrown out trying to steal. Reed Trimble notched a pair of hits and a stolen base. And finally Maxwell Costes, a Baltimore native and University of Maryland alum, made his Delmarva debut. He went 0-for-1 with three walks.\nBox scores for Wednesday’s games can be found here.\nThursday’s Scheduled Games\n\nTriple-A Norfolk: vs Lehigh Valley, 12:05. Starting pitcher: Beau Sulser (2-4, 4.14 ERA)\nDouble-A Bowie: at Erie, 6:05. Starting pitcher: TBD\nHigh-A Aberdeen: vs Hickory, 7:05.

        "description": "What can be done about rising prices – and would nationalising gas and electricity firms help?Governments across Europe have been funding relief measures to help people with energy and petrol bills. The UK announced a £15bn package in May, largely in the form of cash payments to households, while EU member states are estimated to have spent €280bn (£243bn) over the past year on everything from subsidies and price caps to one-off payments. But bills for households and businesses are reaching unsustainable levels, with further increases expected next year, sharpening the debate over whether ministers should be intervening directly in energy markets to help bring prices down.As Russia threatens to further reduce gas supplies, politicians in Italy, Spain, Greece and the Czech Republic are among those pushing for coordinated action. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Monday Brussels was considering measures to be adopted by the 27 member states. What are the options? Continue reading...",

        "description": "Xander Bogaerts hit a grand slam and drove in five runs, J.D. Martinez also homered to back Michael Wacha’s strong start for Boston and the Red Sox held on to beat the Minnesota Twins 6-5 on Wednesday night.Bogaerts and Martinez went deep during a five-run third inning against Minnesota starter Joe Ryan. Bogaerts added an RBI double in the sixth as Boston snapped a three-game losing streak.“It was a pitch in the zone and he didn’t miss it,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said of Bogaerts’ slam. “We needed that one. It’s been a grind offensively for a while and to get a big hit like that, with one swing (to) score four, it was huge.”Wacha (10-1) won his seventh straight decision, yielding two runs on four hits in six innings and striking out seven. Garrett Whitlock surrendered three runs in two relief innings. Matt Barnes allowed the first two batters in the ninth to reach but finished out his fourth save.Ryan (10-7) gave up five runs on eight hits in five innings. He had allowed just four runs over his previous three starts, spanning 17 2/3 innings.The Twins lost for the first time in six games but didn’t lose any ground in the AL Central. Cleveland, which lost 4-0 to Baltimore, leads the division by 1 1/2 games.“When you get down that much, it’s not like you’re going to come back every day from something like that, but you can work and you can try to find a way and scratch off a couple of runs and get a little closer and see what happens,” Minnesota manager Rocco Baldelli said. “After we got behind, I was happy with what I saw from the at-bats. I was happy with the way we kept playing, and we came back at them and were a swing away from winning the ballgame.”The Twins had won four straight games in comeback fashion.Bogaerts and Wacha have tried to keep Boston in playoff contention, but the Red Sox had lost seven of nine coming into Wednesday. They are eight games back of Toronto for the final AL wild-card spot.“We know the odds,” Cora said. “We know how it works, but I’ve seen teams win 20 in a row before. That can happen. We won 20 out of 29 at one point during the season. Obviously, it’s an uphill battle, but we want to play good baseball. Today, overall, it was a good one.”Bogaerts has multiple hits in six of his last seven games and is 13-for-28 over that stretch, improving his batting average to .308.His sixth career grand slam was a liner to left that just snuck over the plants lining the outfield fence. It was the second straight game with a grand slam in the series; Nick Gordon hit one for the Twins on Tuesday night.Two batters later, Martinez hit his 11th homer of the season.“Down and in to guys that crush down and in, it’s going to be a nice day for them if you’re doing that,” Ryan said.Wacha has been Boston’s most consistent starter. He’s allowed two earned runs or fewer in five of his last seven outings.“That’s when I’m best — filling up the zone, keeping that pace going, keeping the pressure on them, getting in pitcher&#x27;s counts and staying on the attack,” Wacha said.The Twins had scored 14 runs over the first two games of the series, but Wacha held them hitless until Sandy León singled with two outs in the third. Luis Arraez followed with a two-run homer, his eighth of the year.Gordon had a two-run double in the eighth but was thrown out trying to reach third to end the inning.Switching sidesMinnesota claimed LHP Austin Davis off waivers from Boston before the game. Davis was 2-1 with a 5.47 ERA in 50 games for the Red Sox this season and was designated for assignment on Monday. Davis will likely join the Twins’ active roster on Thursday.Trainer’s roomRed Sox: RHP Nathan Eovaldi (right shoulder inflammation) is scheduled to throw a bullpen session Friday.Twins: 2B Jorge Polanco missed his fourth straight game. Polanco is dealing with an unspecified knee injury. Manager Rocco Baldelli said Polanco could have been available to pinch-hit if needed.Up nextRed Sox: Returning home for a four-game series against Texas, Boston will have LHP Rich Hill (6-5, 4.32 ERA) on the mound. The Rangers will start RHP Glenn Otto (6-8, 4.79).Twins: Minnesota starts a road swing on Friday with the first of three against the White Sox. RHP Sonny Gray (7-4, 3.04) will start Friday’s game and Chicago counters with RHP Davis Martin (2-4, 4.62).",

        "description": "Jon O’Brien’s son, Jack, was on the type of summer-long Euro trip that marks an end to late adolescence and a step into early adulthood. Jack was 25; the seven-week trip was the longest he had been away from his parents. His travels included a road trip around Iceland, a train ride through Russia with stops in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and a visit to the Camp Nou soccer stadium in Barcelona. In mid-July 2014, Jack arrived in Pamplona, Spain, to take part in the annual running of the bulls, testing his daring and athleticism on the city’s cobbled streets. Jon scoured the internet for information on the number of injuries and fatalities related to the event as soon as his son told him of his plan.In the early evening, when Jon was still at work in Sydney, his phone buzzed with a text message from Jack. “Did the bull run,” it read. “I’m alive. Rest easy.”Jon was hugely relieved. The dangerous part of Jack’s trip, he thought, was over. Reports in The Sydney Morning Herald about Russian-backed incursions into eastern Ukraine had hardly registered with Jon or his wife, Meryn. In the spring of 2014, pro-Russian separatist rebels had begun seizing territory in the region, leading to an escalating armed conflict on the ground. A few days after the dash in Pamplona, Jack sprinted through Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport to catch Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 heading to Kuala Lumpur. From there he would continue home to Australia. Jon and Meryn had made plans to meet him at the airport.The Boeing 777 on which Jack was traveling with 297 others never reached the runway in Malaysia. It returned to earth instead in pieces, strewn across a field in eastern Ukraine. Jon and Meryn learned what had happened from a news bulletin on the radio, a moment Jon likens to a “hammer blow, straight off.”Nearly a decade on from the disaster, Jon and Meryn are awaiting judgment from a court in the Netherlands. Among the 298 passengers and crew members who died, the majority, 196, were Dutch nationals. The flight had been under way for about three hours when it lost contact with air-traffic control in eastern Ukraine. Some airlines had already started rerouting flights because of their risk assessment of the fighting in the region, but the Malaysian flight was in airspace then still deemed safe by international aviation authorities.Russia has always denied any involvement in the crash. Much of the early reporting on Russia’s role in the disaster was conducted by open-source investigators who combed through photos and videos posted to social media, piecing together the movements of the Russian Buk surface-to-air missile system used to shoot down the plane. Particularly instrumental was the work of Bellingcat, a website that the British journalist Eliot Higgins had established just days before the crash. Much of what the site uncovered about Russian involvement was later confirmed by the official international investigation into the downing.[Read: Who shot down Flight MH17?]Four men, all pro-Russian separatists, face charges because, prosecutors have argued, they “cooperated closely to obtain and deploy” the missile system used to shoot down the plane. Three are Russian, and the other is Ukrainian. None has surrendered to the court, and only one of the men has put up a defense at trial, pleading not guilty via recorded video messages.The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier this year has directed far greater global attention to the belligerence of Moscow and President Vladimir Putin. For the O’Briens, that new notice has left them contemplating how the death of their son eight years ago fits into the war raging today.“Our son was killed in Russia’s war on Ukraine, in the early days of that war,” Jon told me, when we spoke recently. “It is the same war,” Meryn interjected. “There is a direct line from July 17, 2014, to the day in February this year when Russia invaded.”Jon and Meryn started a website where, with the help of one of Jack’s friends, they occasionally post updates and share memories of Jack. Jon wrote about the love of soccer he and Jack shared, and about Jack’s fandom anxiety from following the ups and downs of Australia’s national team. “I would say my biggest passion is soccer,” Jack wrote for a job application in 2012 that appears on the site. “I have played since I was 7 and will continue to till I’m 70.” Jack had finished a degree in business and was studying to become a personal trainer. Before his European trip, which he took with a childhood friend, Jack had started to gather his belongings for a planned move, away from his apartment behind his parents’ home and into a new one with a roommate. “He was coming back to get on with the rest of his life,” Jon said.Because the site is quite basic and infrequently updated, it’s not all that easy to find by search. I found an email address linked to the site’s registration and wrote to it a few days before July 17, the eighth anniversary of the MH17 disaster. When I got a reply from Jon and Meryn, they said that they would be happy to talk with me, but the immediate timing was hard for them. “Our sadness for Jack is seeping to the fore at this time,” Jon wrote.When we did speak, not long after the anniversary, I was struck by how friendly the O’Briens were and how remarkably collected despite the “wound that will never heal.” At times, they differed over the exact details of the days surrounding Jack’s death, such as who was planning to take the day off to meet him at the airport. The good-natured quibbling was almost the same as you’d hear in the retelling of a favorite family story around the dinner table—if only the subject were not such a horrific, life-altering tragedy.Soon after Jack died, they told me, Meryn noticed on her way to work that there were both Ukrainian and Russian Orthodox churches near their home in Lidcombe, a suburb in western Sydney. This was before the O’Briens had any inkling of the full story of their son’s death—the Buk missile launcher and the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, let alone the disinformation efforts of Russian troll farms. Meryn approached both churches, hoping to gain a better understanding of the distant geopolitical conflict that had claimed the life of their son.They received greatly differing descriptions of the relationship between the neighboring countries, Jon told me. The Russians typically presented a narrative that focused on the bond between the two peoples. The Ukrainians they spoke with, by contrast, recounted a “long history of conflict and bullying and oppression from Russia from their perspective,” Jon said. The words recalled a post I’d noticed earlier on the O’Briens’ website. Despite their own memories of atrocities inflicted on the Ukrainian people, Jon said, the people he and Meryn spoke with showed great compassion and concern. “They were so sorry,” he told me. “They felt regretful that this had happened to us.”[David Frum: Russia has become dangerous again]To mark this year’s anniversary, Jon and Meryn traveled to Canberra, the Australian capital, to take part in a demonstration outside the Russian embassy there. In what was part memorial, part protest, the participants lined an area across the street from the embassy with empty chairs to represent the 298 people who’d been on Flight MH17. They also brought stuffed animals to the memorial to signify the children who were “killed,” Meryn said, before quickly correcting herself—“murdered.”  The MH17 commemorative group was joined by Ukrainians, including newly arrived refugees, and others who had held their own daily protests there since the invasion. No embassy officials emerged—none ever do, they said—so Jon slid through the fence a letter that he’d intended to deliver. (It was gone the next morning, he said.)One of the most maddening and mind-bending aspects of their son’s death has been the disinformation about the crash constantly peddled by Moscow and amplified by a throng of conspiracy theorists and apologists for autocrats. The Russian ambassador responded to a letter Jon wrote, he told me, which relied on familiar talking points that the plane had been brought down not by a Russian missile, as numerous investigations have concluded, but by a bomb on board or a Ukrainian fighter jet.“This is not accidental. This is not people groping for an explanation,” Jon told me. “This is state policy. This is systematic denial and disinformation.” For relatives of the victims, he said, this is “another injury … that is just wearing and draining and offensive.” The effect is so disorienting and demoralizing that at one point, Meryn said, Jon began to question himself and what had happened. They have now accepted that “our reality and [the Russian government’s] reality are not going to meet,” Meryn said.This deliberate, state-sanctioned deception has helped galvanize the Netherlands into action, Marieke de Hoon, an assistant professor of international criminal law at the University of Amsterdam, told me by email. Aviation disasters don’t usually lead to court cases, de Hoon explained, because they get settled between parties who agree on a compensation scheme (sometimes accompanied by an admission of responsibility).Moscow’s position, which has gone far beyond denial of involvement to manufacturing counternarratives, has “generated a situation for the Netherlands,” de Hoon told me, such “that it would either have to blink and let Russia get away with that level of bullying and deception or instead to take up an immensely complicated task of trying to go through legal procedures to get convictions.”[Read: Trump’s enduring willingness to give Russia the benefit of the doubt]The criminal trial in the Netherlands originally began in March 2020. The three Russian men—Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky, and Oleg Pulatov—and one Ukrainian, Leonid Kharchenko, are facing 298 counts of murder. The case file is enormous, consisting of some 65,000 pages of documents, as well as hours of audio and videotapes. These include conversations between two of the men in which they discuss shooting down what they initially thought was a Ukrainian warplane. Only Pulatov has legal representation. He asked to be acquitted as the trial was closing, in June. Dutch prosecutors are seeking life sentences for the four. The court will next month announce the date for its judgment, which is expected to be toward the end of the year. Even if convicted, none of the four is likely ever to serve prison time because Russia, where they are believed to be residing, will not agree to extradite them.The O’Briens attended the opening of the trial in person. Meryn has also watched portions on a livestream provided by the court. Jon said he found it beyond admirable—“staggering,” in fact—that “the Dutch people, through their taxes, are paying for the defense of one of the people being accused of being complicit in the deaths of 200 of their citizens.” It showed, he said, “how serious the commitment to truth is. And contrast that to the crap on the other side.”Higgins, the Bellingcat founder, hopes that the verdict will mark an important break with the impunity Russia has generally enjoyed for its actions, which has served only to embolden Putin. “They get away with it. There are no real consequences for their actions, and what is happening today is a direct result of that lack of consequences,” he told me. “It took a full-scale invasion of a European country for there to be actual consequences.”For the O’Briens, the court ruling will help, they hope, crystallize the truth and cut through the disinformation about what happened to Flight MH17 and their son. They are under no illusions that the handful of men on trial represents anything close to the full docket of those who are culpable. “There are a whole heap of people above these four that are responsible and accountable for the murder of those 298 people,” Jon told me. “And, now we know, the deaths of thousands of people in Ukraine.”",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3623136-how-the-ira-can-supercharge-local-climate-action-and-strengthen-communities/",
        "description": "The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the most ambitious climate legislation in U.S. history, was signed into law last month. Not only will it help advance critical climate action, it will also bring huge opportunities right to the doorsteps of Americans across the country.\n\n\n\nThis new law offers a plethora of policies that will fight the climate crisis, improve air quality and help all communities benefit from clean energy in their neighborhoods and homes. The passage of this national legislation is game-changing for the climate and for people. It will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 1 billion metric tons in 2030 — 10 times more climate impact than any other single piece of legislation ever enacted — and it’s the first to put the needs of disadvantaged communities front and center.\n\n\n\nPollution affects everyone’s health, but low-income communities and communities of color have historically been most burdened with negative health impacts. The bill will deploy clean energy at scale over the next decade, and in doing so reduce particulate pollution from fossil fuels to avoid up to 3,900 premature deaths and up to 100,000 asthma attacks annually by 2030.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTax credits are one key element of the bill that will drive clean energy production. They are available for the next 10 years and designed to benefit communities, support well-paying jobs, reduce pollution and shrink energy costs for consumers. According to recent analyses, the IRA’s power sector tax credits could translate into up to $278 billion in electricity cost savings, with the average household saving up to $220 annually through lower energy bills and less costly goods and services more generally.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to earlier versions of the credits, these are directly payable to non-taxpaying entities such as states, tribes, municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives, enabling them to drive clean energy projects in their localities without having to enter into complex financing arrangements. This is critically important, as it enables more of the federal funds to go directly to “steel in the ground” in the communities where they are most needed.\n\n\n\nTo benefit workers and disadvantaged communities, the tax incentives are five times larger for projects that meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, which will encourage new well-paying jobs and help us train the next generation of workers. The IRA is predicted to create almost 1 million jobs between now and 2030. Bonus incentives are also provided for clean energy projects sited in or benefiting low-income communities, those that are historic victims of environmental injustice and communities at risk of losing fossil fuel jobs or revenues in the energy transition.\n\n\n\nCommunities will also be able to shape projects to address specific environmental justice concerns through grants that can be used for everything from reducing pollution in low-income communities and communities of color to increasing transit options and reconnecting communities previously separated by highway expansions. In addition, a $27 billion clean energy technology accelerator, or green bank, will invest in state and local financing institutions to rapidly deploy clean technologies and leverage private sector dollars — with a focus on projects in disadvantaged communities that would otherwise lack access to financing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt the household level, homeowners will directly benefit from an influx of tax credits and rebates for energy efficiency improvements and clean energy technologies (including heat pumps, EVs, solar panels, electric ovens, induction stoves and more) that will enable them to save money while helping to address climate change and pollution in their communities. More than 200 local governments have set community-wide 100% clean energy goals, and these residential incentives will be critical for encouraging homeowners to take action to help meet these goals. Savings for consumers can be substantial — on the order of $1,800 per year if they take advantage of multiple incentives for heat pumps, water heaters, electric vehicles and solar panels.\n\n\n\nSo, how can cities and towns take advantage of these federal programs while also advancing equity? Communities don’t need to go it alone — they can learn from peers, collaborate with states and access many technical assistance programs underway. To prioritize community needs, they can hold listening sessions to understand disadvantaged populations’ unique challenges, needs and priorities. Through these conversations, the local government can create a realistic plan that prioritizes projects that have already received local buy-in. In addition, cities that are new to these types of projects can learn from those who have already been directing funding specifically for climate and energy projects within disadvantaged communities.\n\n\n\nThe IRA is estimated to put the U.S.’s target of cutting emissions in half by 2030 within reach. With the passage of this new law, communities are closer than ever before to reaping the economic, health and climate benefits for all their residents, including those most vulnerable. By taking advantage of these new opportunities at our fingertips, we can make a better future start today.\n\n\n\nLori Bird&nbsp;is director of World Resources Institute’s&nbsp;U.S. Energy Program&nbsp;and Polsky chair for renewable energy.",

        "description": "Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Your Thursday morning dose of New York Mets and MLB news, notes, and links. Meet the Mets\n\nThe Mets defeated the Dodgers 2-1 on an absolutely electric night at Citi Field. Between Jacob deGrom’s brilliance, Brandon Nimmo’s game-saving catch, Timmy Trumpet, and Edwin Díaz, Citi Field had all the drama and atmosphere of October. Starling Marte provided all of the offense with a two-run blast, which deGrom and company were able to make stand up. The ace’s only blemish was a home run allowed to Mookie Betts and a mistake to Justin Turner that Nimmo robbed over the wall. Timmy Trumpet helped herald in the Dodgers’ loss, announcing the arrival of Díaz into the game with a live performance of “Narco.”  Díaz made quick work of some of the Dodgers’ best hitters to secure a memorable night for the Amazin’s. \nChoose your recap: Amazin’ Avenue, Faith and Fear in Flushing, Daily News, Newsday, Post\nBrandon Nimmo saved the game with an incredible play to rob Justin Turner of a home run that would have tied the game in the seventh. \nJacob deGrom was brilliant once again against the top team in the league, and so far this season he seems to be getting better. \nAfter the game, Mookie Betts offered high praise for the Mets’ ace. \nLos Angeles might have the better record, but having a healthy deGrom changes the equation a bit for the Mets.\nThe Dodgers are the top team in the National League, but their model for success is one that Steve Cohen is trying to emulate. \nWhile the payroll is projected to be pretty high in 2023, Cohen is not too worried about it and is focusing on the 2022 team.\nTimmy Trumpet did not get to play “Narco” in the series opener, but he got to play the trumpet for Díaz and the Citi Field crowd last night and did not disappoint. \nThe closer felt the electric atmosphere from the crowd as he entered the game.\nTylor Megill is set to make a rehab appearance after working his way back from a shoulder strain.\nUnfortunately for the Mets, the news wasn’t all positive. Brett Baty was diagnosed with a UCL tear in his thumb that will require surgery. \nThe Mets’ current owner was the one to decide to retire Willie Mays’s number to finally fulfill a promise made by their original owner.\nAround the National League East\nThe Braves defeated the Rockies 3-2 behind a strong start from Kyle Wright. \nThe Marlins fell to their interstate rivals 2-1 despite a solid performance from Trevor Rogers.\nThe Phillies trounced the Diamondbacks in Arizona. Former GM Lee Thomas, who built the 1993 team, died at the age of 86.\nThe Nationals defeated the Athletics 5-1 in a battle of two teams playing out the string.\nAround Major League Baseball\nWhite Sox manager Tony La Russa is dealing with a medical issue and will be returning to Arizona to undergo further tests.\nThe Orioles called up top prospect Gunnar Henderson who hit a home run in his debut in the majors.\nThe Padres and Giants will play a two-game series in Mexico City next season which will be the first time a regular season MLB game will be played there.\nIn a shocking turn of events, trading away your best reliever doesn’t usually work out, as the Brewers are finding out the hard way.\nThe Rays placed Shane McClanahan on the injured list with a shoulder impingement after he was scratched from his start against the Marlins.\nThis Date in Mets History\nOn this date in 1975, Tom Seaver became the first pitcher in major league baseball history to strike out 200 batters in eight consecutive seasons.",

        "description": "Travelers rest on the ground while waiting for their flights at Los Angeles International Airport on July 1. On Thursday, the U.S. Transportation Department is rolling out a new website that will allow passengers to see what they&#x27;re legally entitled to when an airline cancels or significantly delays their flight.Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty ImagesAs we head into the last busy travel weekend of summer, several major airlines are promising to deliver better customer service, especially if they can&#x27;t deliver you to your destination on time, including providing meals and hotel rooms to those passengers stranded by significant flight delays or cancellations when those disruptions are the airlines&#x27; fault.The airlines, including Alaska, American, Delta, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest and United, are committing to the customer service improvements just as the U.S. Department of Transportation rolls out a new website on Thursday that will allow air travelers to see what they&#x27;re legally entitled to when an airline cancels or significantly delays their flight. They&#x27;ll also be able to compare airlines&#x27; customer service policies side by side.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told NPR in an interview last week that this summer&#x27;s air travel chaos, with widespread flight delays and cancellations, is prompting the action. Data from the flight-tracking site FlightAware.com shows that since Memorial Day weekend, airlines have canceled more than 50,000 flights, while more than half a million flights have been delayed.Additionally, Transportation Department figures show that the leading cause of flight delays and cancellations this year has been the airlines&#x27; own operational and scheduling problems, not weather or air traffic control issues. &quot;The basic message [to the airlines] is to raise the bar,&quot; Buttigieg said. &quot;Look, Americans have had experiences with cancellations, delays and poor customer service that just aren&#x27;t at an acceptable level.&quot;&quot;We understand there are some things they&#x27;re up against, extreme weather or other situations, that are beyond their control,&quot; Buttigieg added. &quot;But a lot of things are in their control. And one of those things is how they treat customers.&quot;The transportation secretary said there are some things airlines must do, as required by law or Transportation Department rules, including refunding airfares for canceled flights.&quot;If you get canceled for any reason — you don&#x27;t take your flight — they have to offer you a cash refund. If you&#x27;d rather take miles or a different flight, fine. But that&#x27;s up to you, not them. They&#x27;ve got to give you a refund. That&#x27;s a basic rule,&quot; Buttigieg said.There are also things that Buttigieg said airlines ought to do for passengers when flights are significantly delayed or canceled, like paying for meals and overnight accommodations. Right now, some airlines do and others don&#x27;t, but most are not very upfront about what they&#x27;ll do.&quot;A lot of the airlines are not quite transparent about how and when they&#x27;ll take care of passengers,&quot; Buttigieg continued. &quot;So we&#x27;re going to put that information out ourselves&quot; in the form of an online dashboard that Buttigieg said will provide clarity about passengers&#x27; rights. It will also allow travelers to see what additional services airlines have committed to provide when flights are canceled or delayed because of an airline problem, and it will enable passengers to compare carriers side by side.The list of commitments includes &quot;Rebook passenger on same airline at no additional cost&quot; and &quot;Rebook passenger on another airline at no additional cost,&quot; as well as meals, hotel accommodations and ground travel for delays of more than three hours or cancellations that strand passengers overnight.&quot;Picture kind of a matrix where you can see [green] check marks and [red] Xs on what each airline will or won&#x27;t do,&quot; Buttigieg said. &quot;So you can actually compare and know your rights before you choose to purchase that ticket and before you board that plane.&quot;Just by telling the airlines that they would be publishing this information clearly and in an easy-to-view format, Biden administration officials say many airlines were spurred into improving the level of customer service that they&#x27;re offering.American, Delta, JetBlue and United have agreed to all 10 of the customer service commitments suggested. Hawaiian has agreed to nine, while Alaska and Southwest have agreed to eight. Allegiant is the only one of the 10 largest U.S. airlines listed on the dashboard that did not agree to provide any customer service commitment.While some travelers and consumer advocates applaud the administration&#x27;s effort to prod the airlines to improve customer service, some are wary.&quot;We certainly are holding out hope that they [the airlines] will do the right thing,&quot; says Bill McGee of the American Economic Liberties Project. &quot;But I think this industry has a long track record, and I&#x27;ve been around this industry myself for 37 years, working in it, writing about it and advocating for passengers. And I got to tell you, the track record is very poor.&quot;&quot;Maybe some positive [customer service] developments&quot; will come out of the dashboard, he says, &quot;but the fact is, that is not nearly enough. ... The term &#x27;lipstick on a pig&#x27; comes to mind when we talk about this dashboard.&quot;He says all the things the airlines are promising to do should be required under federal rules or law so the airlines can&#x27;t backtrack and are forced to deliver on their promises.The new airline consumer dashboard is being released as huge crowds of travelers are expected at the nation&#x27;s airports. The number of people flying is expected to be at or even above the pre-pandemic level of Labor Day weekend in 2019.The travel-booking app Hopper predicts 12.6 million people will fly between Thursday and Monday, Sept. 5.In addition to long lines and crowded gates, those going through several major airports on Thursday will encounter off-duty airline pilots picketing. Both the Air Line Pilots Association, the union representing pilots at Delta, United, Spirit and JetBlue, and the Allied Pilots Association, which represents pilots at American, are doing the informational picketing to call on airline management to fix the operational problems that have led to widespread delays and cancellations this summer and to invest more in their workers.The pilots say they also want to draw attention to scheduling issues that they say have led to huge increases in incidents of pilot fatigue this year.

        "description": "Photo by Eric Espada/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Recapping how the Yankees’ top AL opponents fared on August 31st. August has at last fully come and gone. So even though October will have a few more regular season games than it normally does (due to the owners’ lockout delaying the season), the beginning of September always carries its own gravitas. It’s as good a time as any to reacquaint yourself with the current MLB standings — if you haven’t been doing so through our series already, of course.\nThe American League’s leading teams will be chronicled daily as we run through the remainder of 2022. We don’t need to relive the Yankees’ misery, so let’s get to it.\n\nHouston Astros 5 (84-47), Texas Rangers 3 (58-71)\n\nThe resurgent Martín Pérez has been one of the Rangers’ few bright spots in 2022, and one of his highlights involved a shutout of the mighty Astros back in May. But he found no such luck on Wednesday, even with an early lead after Corey Seager’s first-inning homer off Cristian Javier. The Astros peppered him to death with eight singles and a double, and said two-bagger from the bat of Jose Altuve put Houston back in front, 3-2.\n\nThe Astros eventually went up, 5-2, and though Javier had to be pulled after five innings with a pitch count nearing 100, the Houston bullpen held firm. The quartet of Phil Maton, Ryne Stanek, Will Smith, and Rafael Montero allowed just two hits and nary a run or walk over the final four frames. Dusty Baker’s club retains a healthy five-game lead entering September ahead of the Yankees for AL home-field advantage.\n\nTampa Bay Rays 2 (72-57), Miami Marlins 1 (55-75)\n\nIn perhaps a not-too-surprising fun fact that I learned from the Marlins’ broadcast last night, Miami is an atrocious 2-18 against Tampa Bay since the start of 2019. They just usually don’t even have a prayer against their in-state rivals.\nThat trend continued last night, but I suppose if it makes old pal Don Mattingly feel any better, the Fish at least made it competitive. Trevor Rogers matched Drew Rasmussen with six innings of one-run ball, as Jon Berti went deep for one of Miami’s five hits on the night. It’s hard to win when you only get five hits though, and with the Marlins trying some 31-year-old named Tommy Nance on the mound in the 10th, the Rays won the battle of the bullpens.\n\nManuel Margot brought Tampa’s zombie runner in with a hit, and occasional opener Jalen Beeks closed one out for a change with a perfect 10th. The suddenly-surging Rays ended August with AL-best 18-9 record and remain on top of the Wild Card chase, half a game ahead of the second-place Mariners and two up on Toronto. Most importantly for the Yankees, the Rays are now within six games of them for the first time since June 3rd, and a weekend sweep at the Trop could shrink the once-enormous advantage to three. Bad!\n\nChicago Cubs 7 (56-75), Toronto Blue Jays 5 (70-59)\n\nI think if you told a random Blue Jays fan that the Cubs’ Wednesday pitching roll call included each of Luke Farrell, Manuel Rodríguez, Mark Leiter Jr., Erich Uelman, Michael Rucker, Brandon Hughes, and Rowan Wick, they would’ve expected a win — particularly at home. Toronto even got homers from Cavan Biggio and Alejandro Kirk to help them plate five runs.\nMitch White didn’t hold up his end of the bargain for the Jays though, as for the second-straight start, he threw a clunker against a bad team. Toronto might have a potent offense, but it’s hard for anyone to win when you go down 5-0 by only the third.\n\nBiggio and Kirk made a game of it, but that unlikely North Side pitching staff held on to avoid a sweep.\n\nSeattle Mariners 5 (72-58), Detroit Tigers 3 (50-80)\n\nThe Tigers became the fourth MLB team this year to hit the ignominious 80-loss mark before the end of August, and they are unquestionably the most disappointing since none of the other three (A’s, Pirates, and Nationals) began 2022 with any vague notions of contending.\nFor a little while though, it looked like A.J. Hinch’s ballclub might upset the far-superior M’s. Jeimer Candelario broke a 2-2 in the sixth by singling Eric Haase in, which at least briefly brought a smile to the hometown fans’ faces in Detroit. But this is not a year for smiles in the Motor City, and just three batters into the seventh, the lead had vanished.\n\nGive credit to Abraham Toro — he’s had a miserable season of his own that included a demotion to Triple-A after being the prize of the controversial Kendall Graveman trade last year. He got the job done anyway, helping Seattle avoid an unnecessary loss. The M’s tacked on a fifth run in the ninth via a bases-loaded walk in the ninth, and Paul Sewald saved his 17th game of the year.\nWith the season entering its home stretch, the Mariners are in prime position to snap their 21-year playoff drought. At the very least, they’ll need the Orioles and Twins to remain at bay in the Wild Card race throughout September (and the first few days of October), but the odds are good for the longest postseason drought in North American pro sports to end.\nOther Contenders\n\n\nBaltimore Orioles 4 (68-61), Cleveland Guardians 0 (68-60): Wednesday night in Cleveland was all about ascendant O’s prospect Gunnar Henderson making his MLB debut. And what a welcome party it was for the youngest Oriole to take the field since Manny Machado in 2012. Henderson lost his helmet on a swing in the fourth, but homered off Triston McKenzie for his first career hit as Jordan Lyles and company blanked the Guardians.\n\nBoston Red Sox 6 (63-68), Minnesota Twins 5 (67-62): It’s been a bad year in Boston, who definitely did not expect to begin September 2022 playing mostly meaningless baseball after coming two wins shy of a World Series berth in 2021. But every now and then, they do have a game go mostly how they expected, as both Xander Bogaerts and J.D. Martinez homered as part of a five-run third in a 6-5 victory. Minnesota had the winning run at the plate in the ninth, but Carlos Correa bounced into a double play to end it.\n\nMLB Standings at a Glance\nWe won’t do this for every day of September, but at the start of the month, why not? We’ll try to only hit the at-worst mildly relevant teams, though. The current playoff teams are in board.\nAL East\n\n\nNew York Yankees [5 GB Astros for top seed]\n\nTampa Bay Rays (6 GB)\nToronto Blue Jays (8 GB)\nBaltimore Orioles (10 GB)\n\nAL Central\n\n\nCleveland Guardians [9.5 GB Yankees for No. 2 seed]\n\nMinnesota Twins (1.5 GB)\nChicago White Sox (5 GB)\n\nAL West\n\n\nHouston Astros [top seed]\n\nSeattle Mariners (11.5 GB)\n\nAL Wild Card\n\n\nTampa Bay Rays (2 GA)\n\nSeattle Mariners (1.5 GA)\nToronto Blue Jays\nBaltimore Orioles (2 GB)\nMinnesota Twins (3 GB)\n\n\nNL East\n\n\nNew York Mets [8 GB Dodgers for top seed]\n\n\nAtlanta Braves (3 GB)\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies (10 GB)\n\nNL Central\n\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals [7 GB Mets for No. 2 seed]\n\n\nMilwaukee Brewers (6 GB)\n\nNL West\n\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers [top seed]\n\n\nSan Diego Padres (18.5 GB)\n\nNL Wild Card\n\n\nAtlanta Braves (7.5 GA)\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies (0.5 GA)\nSan Diego Padres\nMilwaukee Brewers (2.5 GB)",

Neither side possesses, nor is likely to possess in the foreseeable future, the kind of decisive military advantage that would allow it to prevail on the battlefield and realize even its more modest geopolitical objectives.\n\n\n\nNor do either of the belligerents possess the staying power to continue the war at the current level of intensity for much longer. Russia faces economic and political obstacles to the kind of mass mobilization prolonged conflict would require, while Ukraine’s Western backers are unlikely to be willing or able to continue supporting Kyiv in the face of gas shortages, economic woes and the exhaustion of their own stockpiles of arms and ammunition.\n\n\n\nThis being the case, the only real question is whether the current operational reality can best be characterized as a “mutually hurting stalemate” or a “mutually desperate stalemate.”\n\n\n\nIf it is a mutually hurting stalemate, then the conditions are ripening for productive negotiations to begin. A mutually hurting stalemate, of course, is technically a situation in which both belligerents find themselves locked in a conflict that neither can win unilaterally and that is so painful to both that they judge it more advantageous to start negotiating rather than continue fighting.\n\n\n\nBut we are not yet in such a stalemate — indeed, we are not even close to the point where Kyiv and Moscow will judge that there is more to be gained than lost by joining their foes at the negotiating table.\n\n\n\nOn the Russian side, the levels of pain remain high but bearable. The international sanctions have hurt Russia, but not as dramatically as many had hoped; and Russian battlefield losses, while eye-popping, have not been back breaking. Moreover, Moscow’s ability to hang in the fight has been reinforced by the belief (hope?) that both Ukrainian resolve and Western support will not survive the coming winter. Bottom line: While Russia is hurting, the pain remains bearable.\n\n\n\nAnd that pain is certainly more bearable – to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his cronies, at least, if not the average soldier at the front – than conceding to Kyiv even a “small win” at the negotiating table. The Russian leadership simply has too much invested in the success of its “special military operation” to agree to return even to the January 2022 status quo ante, let alone to that of January 2014.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, on the Ukrainian side, the pain of the current stalemate remains politically sustainable. Painful? Without doubt. The physical devastation and human suffering visited on Ukraine by the Russian invaders is without doubt cataclysmic. But not unbearable. As with the Russian regime, the Ukrainian leadership continues to be able to sustain the war politically and militarily, buoyed by the belief (hope?) that the other side will crack before they do and that all that is required for victory, therefore, is to hang in the fight just a little bit longer.\n\n\n\nSo, while the situation on the ground in Ukraine is obviously a stalemate, and while it can fairly be described as mutually hurting, it cannot really be characterized as a “mutually hurting stalemate” in the technical sense described above. And that, I would suggest, means that it is evolving into something far more ominous — something I will call a mutually desperate stalemate.\n\n\n\nIn this form of stalemate, one or more of the belligerents comes to consider both battlefield deadlock and diplomatic negotiations to be unbearably costly, driving it to desperately seek a third option — one that may be risky and even dangerous but that also entails the prospect of ending the stalemate on favorable terms.\n\n\n\nThe logic here is simple: Where one of the belligerents knows that the status quo will become increasingly costly and foreseeably untenable, “rolling the dice,” while risky, is the most rational course of action because it at least creates the possibility of salvaging a “small win,” even if it will not yield a decisive victory.\n\n\n\nThat’s the risky part. The dangerous part is that rolling the dice is likely to involve some sort of escalation. On Kyiv’s part this might entail horizontal escalation involving attacks on Russian assets in Crimea or Russia proper, or both. On Moscow’s part it might similarly entail horizontal escalation, though in the form of strikes against NATO members providing arms, ammunition and other forms of aid to Ukraine. But it might also involve vertical escalation in the form of nuclear strikes, either for demonstration purposes or in earnest.\n\n\n\nEither way, the potential for catastrophe – for both the belligerents and others – is obvious. The war could become even more destructive, possibly even widening to include NATO members, and conceivably even spiraling into a nuclear war between Russia and the United States.\n\n\n\nWe’re not there yet, of course. Neither Russia nor Ukraine have reached the point of mutually desperate stalemate. But it is a looming probability, and one that may be upon us sooner rather than later.\n\n\n\nIndeed, I would suggest that, given the way this conflict has unfolded to date, the only real questions now are: When will we achieve this state of mutually desperate stalemate, which side will succumb first and what will the ensuing escalation look like?\n\n\n\nAndrew Latham is a professor of international relations at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minn., and a non-resident fellow at Defense Priorities in Washington, D.C.

        "description": "A new decade was not very kind to former White Sox GM Ed Short, fired on this day 52 years ago.\n    \n\n  Ed Short says goodbye, while Ed Farmer squashes a beef 1970\nWith the White Sox approaching the end of their worst season in franchise history, GM Ed Short was fired after nine years on the job. Short made brilliant offseason deals in 1963 and 1964 to net the club players like Hoyt Wilhelm, Pete Ward, Tommy John and Tommie Agee, but starting in 1968 his moves backfired and lost the club players like Agee, Tommy McCraw, Don Buford and Bob Locker without getting anything substantial in return.\nSox owner John Allyn, who bought the team from his brother the year before, also fired field manager Don Gutteridge, scouts and other front-office personnel in a massive house cleaning. \n\n1980\nEd Farmer and Tigers outfielder Al Cowens put their feud to rest before a 11-3 White Sox win at Tiger Stadium. In 1979, Farmer broke Cowens’ jaw with a pitch, and on June 20, 1980, Cowens attacked Farmer on the mound instead of running to first base on a grounder (an attack that permanently debilitated Farmer, who had a genetic kidney condition). Cowens had been suspended for seven games for that attack, while Illinois issued an arrest warrant that prevented Cowens from playing an August series in Chicago.\nFarmer said he would drop the charges against Cowens in exchange for a handshake, and thus the two players exchanged lineup cards and shook hands before the game on this day. \n\n1998\nAlbert Belle hit his 42nd home run of the season in the same game he got his 337th total base of the season. Both milestones set a franchise record, in Chicago’s 9-5 win at Baltimore. Belle ended the year with 49 home runs and 399 total bases. Later he’d say, with some truth, that he had a better year than the much-publicized duo of Mark McGwire and former Sox outfielder Sammy Sosa.",

Tyler Anderson nearly matched him, allowing two runs in seven innings.\nThe Dodgers’ best chance came in the seventh, when Justin Turner’s bid for a game-tying home run off deGrom instead was snatched out of the air by Brandon Nimmo. Plus, we got to see live trumpet playing and Edwin Díaz close out the middle game of the series for the Mets.\nMookie Betts homered for the Dodgers’ only run, his fifth home run in his last five starts.\nNow it’s September, and Clayton Kershaw is back to start the series finale.

        "description": "Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Cubs ended a 14-year losing streak north of the border. TORONTO — It required six relievers (seven, if you count Luke Farrell on what was a bullpen day) and some timely hitting, but Wednesday night the Cubs ended a losing streak in Canada that had lasted more than 14 years.\nSure, it was only a five-game Canadian losing streak (three in 2014, the first two in this series), but the Cubs’ 7-5 win over the Blue Jays was satisfying and in the end, well-played, and was the first Cubs victory north of the border since June 15, 2008.\nAs they have now done 39 times this year, the Cubs scored in the first inning and took the lead. (They’re just 19-20 in those 39 games.) Seiya Suzuki doubled with one out and one out later, Ian Happ drove him in [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nThey increased their lead to 2-0 in the second on an unexpected play. Yan Gomes singled with one out and advanced to second on a walk by Alfonso Rivas. A fly ball allowed Gomes to take third and then the Cubs tried a double steal [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was... bizarre. First, the lead runner on that double steal, Gomes, had exactly five stolen base attempts in his entire career before that one (and none since 2020). Rivas has posted three steals this year in four attempts. These two are not speed merchants. And then, Bo Bichette seemed to pay absolutely no attention to Gomes heading home while Rivas backtracked to first base long enough to allow Gomes to score before being tagged out.\nWeird, but the Cubs will take it. It doesn’t count as a stolen base for Gomes, though.\nThe Cubs put three on the board in the third. Zach McKinstry led off with a triple, but one out later was thrown out at the plate on a contact play. Franmil Reyes, who had hit that ground ball, advanced to third on a double by Ian Happ, his 35th of the year.\nBoth runners scored on a double by Nico Hoerner [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nRafael Ortega’s bloop single made it 5-0 [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cubs had their first five-run lead in a week. What could possibly go wrong? (Don’t answer that.)\nLuke Farrell threw two scoreless innings, retiring the first six Jays he faced, before Teoscar Hernandez singled and Cavan Biggio smashed a long opposite-field home run to make it 5-2. Immediately, David Ross came to lift Farrell, and Manuel Rodriguez, who replaced him, retired the next six Jays in order.\nThe Cubs made it 6-2 in the fifth on this home run by Reyes into the Cubs bullpen [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat could possibly... well, you know.\nMark Leiter Jr. threw a scoreless fifth, but Erich Uelmen, who has been relatively solid since his callup, got hit hard in the sixth. The big blow was a three-run homer by Alejandro Kirk that brought the Jays to within one at 6-5.\nThe Cubs scored an important insurance run in the seventh. Rivas led off with a double and one out later, McKinstry drove him in [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Blue Jays have their own song, which they play before “Take Me Out To The Ballgame” during the seventh-inning stretch:\n\nBack to the game: Michael Rucker had finished the sixth and with two out in the seventh, allowed a single by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Brandon Hughes was summoned and recorded the third out on a deep fly to center. Hughes then threw a scoreless eighth, and then it was closer time.\nRowan Wick hasn’t been good lately, but he was in this one. He retired the first two hitters in the ninth, then issued a walk. George Springer, representing the tying run, came to the plate.\nSpringer popped up to end the game [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cubs have had leads in five of the six games on this road trip, but won just two of those five games. In two of the three losses, they had leads in the sixth inning or later. This says to me: Better bullpen work would likely lead to more Cubs wins. This should be something Jed Hoyer &amp; Co. should work on this offseason, and Hoyer has actually been pretty good at putting together a bullpen (and then trading it away, which obviously won’t happen if the team intends to contend in 2023). Obviously there are other needs as well (starting pitching, for one), but this team isn’t as far from contending as you might think.\nThe Cubs finished August with a 15-15 record, their first non-losing calendar month since May 2021, and also completed a 20-game stretch without an off day at 10-10. They’re 21-18 since the All-Star break.\nLastly, a note on my visit to Toronto and Rogers Centre: If you’ve never been to Toronto, by all means go — there’s lots to see and do, tons of great restaurants and the people are unfailingly polite and friendly. Gameday staff were efficient and helpful and the entire experience was great. The Cubs will be back in Toronto next year (August 11-12-13, 2023), under MLB’s new schedule where all teams play everyone every year. Well worth the trip up north — it’s only an eight-hour drive from Chicago.\nThey will enjoy a day off Thursday, then open a three-game series against the Cardinals in St. Louis Friday, their final meeting with their arch-rivals for 2023. Adrian Sampson will return to the active roster and start Friday’s game. He’ll be opposed by Jordan Montgomery, who shut out the Cubs on one hit at Wrigley Field last week. Game time Friday is 7:15 p.m. CT and TV coverage will be via Marquee Sports Network.",

        "description": "Photo by Rob Carr/Getty Images\n    \n\n  What makes a 31-year-old veteran with a career 5.12 ERA start putting up some of his best-ever numbers in his twelfth season?  With 6 2/3 scoreless innings in Cleveland on Wednesday night, Jordan Lyles lowered his season ERA to 4.25 and raised his season innings to 152.1. Even for a guy known for being a workhorse, that innings total stands out. It’s Lyles’ second-highest season total ever, while his ERA is the third lowest he’s put up in 12 seasons, after 2018 and 2019, one of which Lyles spent working out of the bullpen. \nLyles did some very impressive things on Wednesday night that were typical of what he’s being able to achieve in 2022. To cash out that claim, let’s break down two at-bats from Wednesday’s game in a little more detail. During the second inning, Andrés Giménez stepped into the batter’s box against Lyles. Giménez, as the MASN booth pointed out, is the best-hitting second baseman in the game right now. \nThis was the pitch sequence Giménez faced:\n\tCurveball (Ball 1)\tFour-seam fastball (Foul)\tChangeup (Ball 2)\tCurveball (Swinging strike)\tCurveball (Swinging strike)\nWhat’s unusual about this sequence is that Lyles normally throws fewer than 12% curveballs, but on Wednesday, he threw more of them than any other pitch, at 32%. It’s not that Giménez can’t hit curveballs (actually, he can), but the pitch was working for Lyles that night. Lyles has a six-pitch offering, but he changes the mix from outing to outing. In other words, with him, you can’t sit on any one pitch.\nHere’s one more example from the same game. In the fifth inning, José Ramírez came to the plate having already singled and doubled in two trips. A fearsome hitter, Ramírez is one of a few players beside Aaron Judge who’s in the running for AL MVP right now. Here’s what Lyles threw Ramírez:\n  \n        \n      Source: Statcast\n  \nThe first pitch was way outside the zone, a cutter. The second was a changeup, so far outside the zone it’s partly cut off in the map above. A curveball landed in the dirt for Ball 3. Down 3-0 to Ramírez, who’s seventh out of all MLB hitters in OPS+ and ninth in OPS, I would have packed up shop and just walked him. Instead, Lyles challenged him with a high fastball. Ramírez nearly sent it onto the flag court, but it went foul: Strike 1. Then Lyles landed another fastball, a borderline pitch, for Strike 2. The sixth pitch was a gutsy strike-to-ball curveball which Ramírez fouled off. Seventh and finally, Lyles threw a sinker. Just slower and with a little more break than his fastball, it was different enough to draw a flyout from Ramírez, a 344-foot blast into Anthony Santander’s glove instead of a home run into the bleachers.  \nThis, again, was vintage Lyles. The competitiveness. The pitch mix, which included five of his six pitches. The sequencing: using his fastball to offset his curveball and vice-versa when he ended the at-bat with the sinker.\nBack in December 1, 2021, when Lyles agreed to a deal with the Orioles, it felt like the sort of uninspiring free-agent signing that said “This team is going nowhere in 2022.” Lyles had led the league in earned runs in both 2020 and 2021. His career ERA of 5.12 was among the worst out of established starters. \nInstead, Lyles is outperforming himself and making the Orioles front office and coaching staff look rather smart. His value in terms of steadiness is beyond dispute. Lyles is tied for first in the Majors in starts, and his 152.1 innings pitched rank fifteenth, putting him on an elite list of rotation stalwarts including Sandy Alcantara, Miles Mikolas, Max Fried and Corbin Burnes. Those are far better pitchers, but still: you can’t give your team value if you’re not pitching. In 27 starts this year, Lyles has failed to make it to the fifth inning only once, and he’s given up four earned runs or less in 23 of them. Always brilliant? No. But he’s reduced wear-and-tear on the bullpen, plus the odds are high that when Jordan Lyles pitches, he won’t collapse. That’s old pro type of stuff.\nSo, is Lyles good? Not compared to the competition, no. Lyles has allowed lots of baserunners this year—lots. Among qualified starters, Lyles leads the league in hits allowed (168), and his WHIP (1.46) and hits per nine innings (10.38 H/9) are second-worst behind only Madison Bumgardner. His walk rate (2.84 BB/9) is tenth highest. Obviously, keeping runners off the basepaths has not been a great strength.\nHowever, Lyles is succeeding by his own terms, giving the Orioles more than what they could have expected with they signed him. His 4.25 ERA in 2022 is his second-best mark in 11 seasons as a starter. His FIP of 4.30 is his third-best. Lyles is also allowing relatively weak contact, the expected average on his fastball and his sinker among his career lowest. \nNotably, this seems to have to do with pitch mix. Like Austin Voth, another new Oriole, Lyles has stopped relying so much on his fastball in 2022, and has mixed in his secondary stuff (notably his changeup and cutter) more often. This, again, is probably an Orioles coaching decision. Lyles’ fastball usage is lower now than in all but three past seasons. \nMoreover, he seems to have a different game plan for each game, and a quick look at the data suggests that he’s mixing and matching his pitches even more than he did in past years. A veteran move, sure, but also one that reflects advanced scouting reports and good coaching. \n  \n        \n      Source: baseballsavant.mlb.com\n  \nWhatever fully explains the Jordan Lyles renaissance, fans should be delighted that a guy signed for inning-eating—and not much more than that—has provided stability and even stretches of brilliance to this rotation. Don’t underestimate the value Jordan Lyles brings to this team, even with his unspectacular numbers. If the Orioles are to keep up the pressure down the stretch, they’ll need him.",

The latest, in a crammed Albert Hall, was given by the London Philharmonic conducted by Edward Gardner, with Allan Clayton, Jamie Barton and James Platt as the soloists and the combined choirs of the Hallé and the London Philharmonic.The concert always promised to be one of the highlights of the current season, and Gardner’s account, launched with a measured treatment of the prelude, and reserving its moments of greatest power for the set pieces of the second part, generally did not disappoint. The choral sound from in excess of 250 voices was majestic, even if with that number of singers the trickier corners of the Demons’ Chorus were not ideally nimble; the hush of the final pages was beautifully controlled and, like the rest of the performance, was never pushed or overplayed by Gardner.

Happy September. \n\nThe Red Sox won last night with their ace on the mound and their star shortstop Xander Bogaerts going yard. Grandly. Still, they lost the series to Minnesota 2 games to 1 which wasn’t ideal. The team now heads home to face the Texas Rangers in a four-game weekend set. The Rangers, in third place in the AL West, sit at 58-71 to the Sox 63-68 record. First pitch from Rich Hill is at 7:10 PM ET. Talk about what you want and be good to one another.",

        "description": "Majorities of Democratic and Republican respondents in a new poll said that they think U.S. democracy is in danger of collapse.\n\n\n\nThe Quinnipiac University poll found that 67 percent of all of those surveyed said democracy is in danger, up 9 points from January. \n\n\n\nSeventy-two percent of registered Democratic voters and 70 percent of Republicans expressed fears about the future of U.S. democracy, as did 69 percent of independents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe fears are higher among women, at just over three-quarters, than among men, at 58 percent — and higher by 1 point among white adults than among Black adults, 70 percent to 69 percent.\n\n\n\nThe results follow polling showing concern about the nation’s democracy, including a recent survey in which threats to democracy ranked as the top concern for a plurality of voters. \n\n\n\nPresident Biden is expected to give a prime-time political address Thursday evening to argue against the “extremist threat to our democracy” he blames on former President Trump and his “Make America Great Again” movement.\n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday said Biden is giving the speech “because he thinks our democracy is at risk.”\n\n\n\nBiden has long pushed against the positions of the former president and his base, but has been ramping up his own rhetoric ahead of this year’s midterms.\n\n\n\nAt a Democratic National Committee event in Maryland last week, Biden told a crowd that “Trump and the extreme MAGA Republicans have made their choice — to go backwards full of anger, violence, hate, and division.”\n\n\n\n“Now you need to vote to literally save democracy again,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe Quinnipiac University poll of 1,584 U.S. adults, conducted Aug. 25-29, has a margin of error of  2.6 percentage points.",

        "description": "There is a way he doesn’t have to end up just a hated, useless old man. | Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images\n    \n\n\n  But if he donates, there’s a win-win-win, and keep-on-winning solution In his excellent recent SSS article Mark Liptak is absolutely right in saying Jerry Reinsdorf won’t sell the White Sox. And he’s absolutely right that it’s all about taxes, if I do say so myself — which I have a few times in the past. \nReinsdorf may have owned the White Sox for more than 40 years, but he has spent his entire adult life making sure that at first other very rich men and then he himself avoid coming even remotely close to paying their fair share of the cost of running a city or state or nation. All perfectly legally, of course. \nHeck, Reinsdorf not only (perfectly legally, of course) gets out of paying taxes in every conceivable way, including investing heavily in two areas of the greatest (perfectly legal, of course) tax scams of all, real estate and sports teams, but he famously blackmailed Illinois’ pathetic politicians (perfectly legally, of course) into paying him far more than he ever paid for the White Sox in the package he got to build a new stadium when he threatened to move to St. Petersburg, Fla. \nCon artist? Sure (perfectly legal variety, of course). Horrible abuser of the people of Illinois? You bet. Sucker? Never.\nBut that doesn’t mean the team can’t have new ownership.\n“HOW CAN THAT BE?” YOU ASK\nThe probable reason — very probable reason — behind the failure of Reinsdorf to sell the White Sox is the incredibly stupid tax system that says that inherited property gets a complete do-over at the time of inheritance, so, in this case, heirs would only pay capital gains tax (and possibly depreciation recapture, which would be at a higher rate) starting from that point — $1.7 billion or so for the entire team, maybe $350 million for the Reinsdorf share were Jerry to keel over tomorrow — instead of from the actual cost of purchase, which was damn near zero. That piece of law probably cost a few million dollars in the purchase of politicians to pass it, saving heirs of the very rich trillions since.\nLike many a billionaire, Reinsdorf follows the Leona Helmsley adage that paying taxes is only for the little people, and he certainly doesn’t consider himself one of those. Heck, he considers himself one to whom taxes should go. After a lifetime of screwing over his fellow citizens, he’s certainly not going to stop now.\nOf course, while he has no doubt worked every possible angle to reduce inheritance taxes as well, there will still be some of those to be paid, perhaps nine figures worth. That’s got to really eat at your craw, doesn’t it, Jerry?\nBut what if you could even avoid those? And probably get your heirs future tax benefits as well?\nYES, JERRY, YOU CAN AVOID ALL TAXES WHILE GETTING THE WHITE SOX NEW OWNERSHIP \nAND TURN YOURSELF FROM A HATED, ARROGANT OLD JERK INTO A REVERED COMMUNITY HERO IN THE PROCESS\nAll you have to do is give the team away.\nSure, doing anything that helps anyone else goes against your principles, but think of posterity. From movies about the Bulls to the hearts of Chicago sports fans, you’re nothing but an ignorant, greedy, grasping jerk, all his successes on the backs of others, his failures all his own. \nYou are despised, and not just for some sportsian failures on the field, or even for being a tightwad. People pretty much just spit out your name.\nThink of those who have inherited that name. You want them to be despised as well, for people to turn away from them in scorn?\nThere’s a way to avoid that, to turn it all around and become part of Chicago and Illinois folklore in a good way.\nGIVE THE TEAM AWAY? YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING!!!!!!!!!\nNot at all.\nWe’re not talking about walking down the street, handing out shares. We’re talking about an official donation to a 501(c)3 non-profit, with all the tax advantages that provides. A tax manipulator (perfectly legal, of course) like you has to like that.\nPlenty of super-rich folks donate large appreciated assets to charities. The White Sox donation of $1.7 billion or so would just be a little bit bigger than most. Or any.\nAnd we’re not talking about blowing your whole estate just to be beloved unto eternity. Your share of the White Sox is probably worth about $350 million — that’s following the guesses you own only about 20% despite preferring to be called “owner” — which is a pittance given your estimated $1.8 billion net worth. Your heirs will never miss it, and they’ll love being respected and admired instead of objects of scorn.\nWould you be screwing over some of your fellow stockholders? Sure. But, frankly, as silent as they’ve been for decades of misrule, they deserve it. And most of them paid zilch for stock way back when.\nCAN A SPORTS TEAM BE RUN BY A NON-PROFIT (NON-PROFIT ON PURPOSE, THAT IS?)\nThe only case at the top levels of major sports is the Green Bay Packers, owned by the citizenry, and it’s only possible because the system was created before the NFL banned such ownership.\nHowever, several minor league teams have been community-owned at one time or another, most recently in Toledo and Memphis, and several summer college-league teams still are.\nThe IRS actually has a charity category for sports organizations, though it seems to be designed for smaller outfits, like youth leagues or a curling team. Still, why not go for a little size enhancement?\nBetter yet, arts organizations definitely would qualify, and there has been more written and said about the fine arts of baseball than the actual fine arts, so calling a baseball team an arts organization should qualify. If the IRS raises an eyebrow, dozens of movies and plays and hundreds of books could be used as supporting evidence.\nBUT GIVE IT TO WHO? OR SHOULD THAT BE, TO WHOM?\nOne option would be to create a foundation or charitable trust, specifically for the donation and the operation of the White Sox. That seems like it might run into some nasty glares from the IRS and threats about arms-length and such, but you’re the tax expert, not I. It also might not strike the public as perfectly altruistic.\nA twist on that would be donating to such a foundation, which in turn sells to a for-profit entity, but that would call for more glares and no reputation enhancement at all.\nThat leads to a third option, donating to a highly reputable existing charity. Help the world, or part of it, help your eternal reputation and that of your heirs, yet still screw the governments and every taxpayer so you can maintain your life’s goal — win-win-win.\nBUT WHICH CHARITY?\nReasonable question. \nBig, international entities would be tempting — the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, UNICEF, that sort of thing — but that would spread the benefits very wide, and thus have less impact per capita or situation. \nBetter would be to stay local. After all, most of the abuse of the Reinsdorf career has been of the people of Illinois and specifically of the Chicago area, be it financial or emotional.\nThere are many, many local charities worthy of support, but it would be best to spread all the wealth as widely as possible. So I suggest the donation of the White Sox to the United Way of Metro Chicago.\nThe United Way would naturally pass on the largesse to dozens or hundreds of other charities, all of them checked out to make sure they are run properly and do good works. The board of the United Way is composed of many extremely important and skilled community members, but it’s probable that few of them know anything about baseball, so it would be just like you were still in charge.\nA donation worth $1.7 billion would dwarf the current UWay handle of just under $100 million, but I’m sure they’ll be able to cope. And I’m sure they’ll give the Reinsdorf family huge amounts of credit.\nObviously, the United Way would probably prefer not to run a baseball team, tempting though the idea may be for Chicagoans, and will likely sell the team and take the proceeds — all tax-free at that point, which should warm the cockles of your heart, Jerry.\nAnyone who has ever worked for a company that got sold knows how it works — on Friday, the new owners say nothing will change, and all personnel should feel secure, and on Monday you come in and there’s a new name on your office door. That should be the case here, with all non-union employees (and hence not the players) told to hand in their resignations and invited to re-apply for their jobs, which none of them will get. Or at least very, very few of them.\nPresumably, the new owners will know a little something about baseball, will hire competent front office and field management based on perceived ability and not some senile whim, and all will be well.\nAND THE WHITE SOX AND THEIR FANS WILL BE SAVED!\nPlease don’t feel you have to rush to get this done, Jerry. By Monday will be fine.",

        "description": "Monkey Barrel, EdinburghSince her last show, about weightlifting, the 39-year-old has split from her son’s father and moved in with a woman. Which adds up to hilarity for the audience if not the comicFor all the challenges that must come with redefining your sexuality in middle age, if you’re a comedian you can at least get material out of it. Since her breakout 2019 show Hench, Jessica Fostekew has split with the father of her son, and begun a same-sex relationship. This experience of switching lane halfway through life’s journey permeates her new show, which speaks with the freshness of perspective you get from suddenly becoming one thing after 39 years of being another. It’s not a set with the polemical punch of Hench, which staked out space for women to be muscular. This follow-up, entitled Wench, finds Fostekew in more equivocal mood: a section on the modern near-ubiquity of plastic surgery is even-handed when one expects Fostekew to let rip. Such is the humility, perhaps, that comes with a blindsiding life change – and with age, too. Fostekew is just at that point where you start feeling displaced by the behaviours of a younger generation, sending one another dick pics (to cite her own examples) and peeing without the slightest concern for who might overhear.

        "description": "Photo by Scott W. Grau/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Along with Spencer Torkelson, the shortstop is on his way to Detroit for an injury delayed debut. Ryan Kreidler’s story in pro ball has been one of self-determination, and it’s finally culminated in his arrival in the big leagues. Wednesday afternoon, the Tigers announced their intent to call up the infield prospect on Thursday. He’ll join Spencer Torkelson as the wayward first baseman returns to the fold as well looking to build a little momentum heading into the offseason.\nIt was widely considered a reach when Kreidler was Detroit’s fourth round selection in 2019, and fans didn’t really get a taste of what he could do on the field until 2021 due to the lost minor league season in 2020. When he got back on the dirt, it was game over for most of the pitchers he faced despite a somewhat aggressive promotion to Double-A Erie to begin the 2021 season. His success with a swing rebuilt with the help of top private instructor Doug Latta catapulted him up prospect lists as the year progressed, and he found himself moved up to Toledo in August. Triple-A has become known as an offense-first league, but his 148 wRC+ had league averages baked in and still pegged him as one of the most dangerous hitters who played at the highest level of the minors. \nWith that performance on the books, it was rightly expected that he’d make his debut in Comerica Park sometime before midseason this year. Those expectations met their grizzly end when Kreidler fractured his hand on a pitch in April. \nHe sat on the sidelines for nearly three months before rehabbing with the High-A West Michigan Whitecaps for three games. There, we were able to chat with him in person, and he explained the swing changes that fueled his breakout season. \n“I wanted to understand myself better,” he said. “I didn’t really have an end goal; obviously I wanted to produce more. I feel like the swing that I had in college was pretty tailor made for the college game — fastballs away, sinker/slider mixes, that sort of thing.” \n“Now, in pro ball, guys like to throw the fastball high. I feel like it was an opportunity to combat that stuff. It resulted in something that made it a little more easy for me out there.”\nIn the month he’s spent in Triple-A since, Kreidler has struggled at times to regain the traction he had in 2021. He went hitless in five of his first nine with the Mud Hens in the month of August and he’s struck out in 29.7 percent of his 111 plate appearances. It’s not all bad, though — he can also boast walks in 18.0 percent of his plate appearances and nine extra base hits. That’s enough to swell his wRC+ to 113, which roughly matches pace with how he was performing at the beginning of the year.\n  \n        \n      Jay Markle - Used with permission\n  \nThough shortstop is Kreidler’s natural position, he’s been repping at second and third base as he gets closer to the majors. Added versatility is a key part of his development into a useful player for Detroit, and fans should expect the majority of his September playing time to be beside Javy Baez rather than in his place. Kreidler is a very sound defender anywhere you put him on the diamond.\nThere’s also the possibility that he’s auditioning for the jobs currently held by Jeimer Candelario and Jonathan Schoop. Both the incumbents have been colossal failures at the plate this year and a new GM will likely replace one or both heading into next season. If Kreidler is able to make a big statement in the home stretch of this season, could it put him in the mix for a long-term position next season? Beat reporter Cody Stavenhagen noted earlier this month that the Tigers “love” Kreidler, but followed that up by saying he’ll need to put up numbers to justify anything more than a look at the highest level. \nTempered expectations are the soup du jour of any mid-level prospect call up, and for Kreidler, that means bracing yourself for a boatload of swings and misses. He will wind up disappointing some fans who only ever bothered to look at last season’s video game numbers and are expecting an elite prospect’s seamless arrival. For reference, Steamer projects a .223/.305/.371 line, including a 28.7 percent strikeout rate. \nIn that vein, there is a chance the Kreidler is simply not ready for the major leagues on either side of the ball. As he explained to us in July, he learned to play out of position on the job, and his lack of reps could come back to bite him. In fact, he said that before this season, he’d never played second base in any game in his entire life. \nAt least during this upcoming month, expect to see Kreidler fill the Willi Castro role, no matter how well or poorly he performs at the plate. Providing rest days for veterans is worth something in and of itself. \nAs yet another lost season winds to its close, the Tigers probably care more about getting a look at Kreidler against MLB pitching rather than fining the ideal winning lineup. It may not go well at first, but it makes sense to give the young infielder a taste of what awaits him at the big league level before he heads into a crucial offseason in his career. The Tigers would’ve liked to get him in a better groove prior to his debut, but the injury just didn’t leave enough time. Don’t expect to see much impact in September, but maybe, just maybe, getting a taste of major league pitching could help Kreidler prepare himself this offseason to take the next step in 2023.",

        "description": "David Wiley, \nimproving learning, \nSept 01, 2022\n\n\n\t\t           \n\t\t           To be honest, I think David Wiley is pursuing a straw man when he argues that open educational resources (OER) have no impact on improving student learning. Indeed, it feel like he is arguing mostly against his own past work. It has never been the purpose to OER to improve student learning; the objective is to improve access to learning for people who have none. That's why (as Wiley himself admits) studying the effectiveness of OER in existing university classes is like \"the equivalent of measuring the effect of a pain relieving drug on a sample of people who are mostly not in pain.\" But to people without access, Wiley argues, OER is only a small part of the mix - after all, he says, only 27 percent of students surveyed indicate that they don't but the textbook. Sure. But nearly 100 percent of those without access to the university class don't buy the textbook. And it's true - these people can access the \"billions of resources which are freely available on the public internet with the same result vis-&agrave;-vis the access hypothesis\" and are not technically OER. But that has always been (part of) my point (contra Wiley) about there being no need to be a license purist to achieve the benefits of open access. But mainly, Wiley here says nothing, and seems to care nothing, about the outcomes of those people not fortunate enough to make it into a university class. That's why he has failed, after all these years, to see the actual benefit of OER.\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

        "description": "11:15am: The Reds have formally selected the contracts of Steer and right-hander Fernando Cruz, per a team announcement. Mike Moustakas and righty Jeff Hoffman were transferred from the 10-day injured list to the 60-day injured list to open space on the 40-man roster.\nCruz, 32, reaches the big leagues in the culmination of one of the more remarkable baseball journeys in recent memory. Drafted by the Royals as an infielder back in 2007, he toiled through four minor league seasons before beginning to experiment off the mound in 2011 and giving up infield work for good by 2012. Cruz still struggled to advance through the minors, however, and after a one-year stop  in the Cubs organization, was out of affiliated ball entirely by 2016.\nFrom 2016-21, Cruz split his time between the Puerto Rican Winter League, the Mexican League (both winter and regular season) and the independent Canadian-American Association, where he worked as a starter and closer alike for the New Jersey Jackals. The Reds signed him this past winter on the heels of his latest indie ball campaign, and he&#8217;s broken out with 56 innings of 2.89 ERA ball in Triple-A, where he&#8217;s punched out 29.3% of his opponents against an 8.4% walk rate.\nWhether Cruz is truly a long-term piece for the Reds can be debated, but it&#8217;s hard not to be happy for a 32-year-old rookie who was out of affiliated ball for six seasons. A call to the Majors must have seemed like a pipe dream not long ago for Cruz, but that MLB debut could come any day now.\n8:27am: The Reds are promoting top infield prospect Spencer Steer to the Majors, reports C. Trent Rosecrans of The Athletic. He&#8217;ll join the big league team today as part of September roster expansion and should get regular opportunities down the stretch.\nSteer, 24, came to the Reds alongside left-hander Steven Hajjar and infielder Christian Encarnacion-Strand in the deadline trade that sent right-hander Tyler Mahle to Minnesota. He recently moved into the back end of Baseball America&#8217;s top 100 prospect rankings, checking in at No. 98 on this month&#8217;s update.\nA third-round pick by Minnesota back in 2019, Steer was the headliner in that Mahle trade, due in no small part to the numbers he posted between Double-A (.307/.385/.591, 144 wRC+) and Triple-A (.242/.345/.485, 117 wRC+) during his time with the Twins. Steer has continued at a strong pace with Cincinnati&#8217;s Triple-A affiliate in Louisville, hitting at a .297/.375/.467 pace. Between the two organizations, he&#8217;s combined for 23 home runs, 30 doubles, a pair of triples and four steals (in seven tries). He&#8217;s walked at a 10.4% clip and punched out in 18.1% of his trips to the plate this season.\nThe Reds have played Steer at all four infield positions, plus one game in right field, but he&#8217;s spent the vast majority of his time at second base and third base &#8212; both this season and in his professional career. With 2021 National League Rookie of the Year Jonathan India entrenched at second base, Steer seems likely ticketed for the hot corner, at least in the long term. For the short term, however, the Reds could potentially continue to bounce him around the diamond while getting a look at his bat against big league pitching. With Joey Votto out for the season and Mike Moustakas back on the injured list (and clearly not factoring into the team&#8217;s long-term plans), Steer should have plenty opportunities for at-bats alongside India and shortstop Jose Barrero, giving Reds fans a potential glimpse of the future infield.\nSteer displayed an ability to make consistent contact this year, has steadily improved his power output since being drafted, and is a solid defender at multiple positions. Steer sits outside the top-100 rankings at FanGraphs and MLB.com but ranks ninth and seventh in the Reds&#8217; system on those respective rankings. Scouting reports on him generally agree that he lacks a true plus tool but also lacks any glaring flaws; his blend of defensive versatility, solid bat-to-ball skills, improved power and an at-least average arm give him the potential to be a regular in the Cincinnati infield for years to come.\nDepending on how much playing time Steer receives down the stretch, it&#8217;s possible he&#8217;ll exhaust his rookie status over the next five weeks. He&#8217;d need more than 130 at-bats to do so, but regardless, he won&#8217;t receive a full year of service in 2022 and won&#8217;t put himself on a path to Super Two trajectory, based on this September promotion. If he remains rookie-eligible heading into 2023, the Reds would retain the ability to receive compensatory draft picks based on potential Rookie of the Year voting in 2023.",

        "description": "Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Well, August was a month, that’s for sure. When I look at the Yankees season, I can’t help but think of Stephen Sonheim’s not-so-famous musical, Merrily We Roll Along. In this 1981 musical, the play opens with the protagonist, a composer-turned-movie producer named Franklin Shepard, throwing a lavish party to celebrate his latest blockbuster success. Such a celebratory moment, however, is in truth the lowest point of his life, as his oldest friend abandons him and his second wife announces that she wants a divorce. Posing the question, “How did you get to be here?” the play moves backwards in time, tracing the lives of Franklin and his two closest friends until concluding the show with an uplifting song that portrays the hopeful youth that these friends shared on the day they met.\nHow did we get to be here? That really is the question for this Yankees season, isn’t it. What can I say about April and May, except perhaps that they embodied the phrase, “We play today, we win today.” June, somehow, was even better, as they ended the month with a commanding 12.5 game lead over the second-place Boston Red Sox. Not surprisingly, at this point in the season, Brian Cashman’s popularity peaked at a whopping 76 percent approval rating.\nWhile the team did plateau a bit in July, as they posted just a 13-13 record that month, the vibes were still pretty good: they still had a +62 run differential, after all, had acquired Andrew Benintendi from the Royals, and the final days of the trade deadline loomed. Not surprisingly, although Cashman’s approval rating did drop, it was only slightly, to a very nice 69 percent.\nAnd then came August. Mehurcules, mensis Augusti venit. Things started out pretty good, that’s for sure — in came Frankie Montas, Lou Trivino, and Scott Effross, out went Joey Gallo. Rumors began to swirl that the team was in on Marlins starter Pablo Lopez. None of the team’s top prospects appeared to be on the move, meaning that Oswaldo Cabrera and Oswald Peraza were ripe for a promotion to The Show any day.\nAnd then Jordan Montgomery was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for a guy in a boot. Suddenly the wind left the sails of the fanbase as everyone pondered why the Yankees would trade away a homegrown left-handed starter in the middle of a pennant race. The good vibes were shattered, and the only way to bring them back was to win some games.\nSo, naturally, after opening August with a win, they didn’t win another game until a week after the trade deadline. Then, it was another two weeks after that before they would string together wins, as they narrowly avoided a four-game sweep by the Blue Jays, swept the Mets, and won the first two games in Oakland. After that, however, it was right back to the early days of the month, as they lost two straight to the A’s and two of three to the Angels. As the bullpen suffered with meltdown after meltdown, the offense completely dried up, leading us all to yell “It’s a Hit” every time somebody not named Aaron Judge successfully put the bat on the ball.\nTopping it all off, injuries laid siege to the team all month. Matt Carpenter fouled a ball off his foot, and could possibly be out for the season. Anthony Rizzo has battled back problems, DJ LeMahieu toe problems. Nestor Cortes, Scott Effross, Aroldis Chapman, Albert Abreu, and Clay Holmes all hit the IL. Giancarlo Stanton, meanwhile, didn’t return from his IL stint until the last week of the month. I look back at the first few months of the season, where the Yankees largely avoided long stints on the injured list, and I think to myself, “I want it the way that it was.”\nOf course, it wasn’t all bad. After a slow start, Benintendi began to rake. Domingo Germán helped solidify an injury-battered rotation. Oswaldo Cabrera and Greg Weissert were both called up from Triple-A Scranton and immediately made major impressions, although Cabrera’s was admittedly much better than Weissert’s.\nAnd so, that brings us to today. Do you approve of the way that Brian Cashman has steered the ship through this mess we called a month? For the purposes of simplicity, the poll as always asks for a simple “yes” or “no,” but as always, please feel free to elaborate more in the comments section below.",

        "description": "Microsoft's deal to buy game company Activision Blizzard for nearly $70 billion is facing an in-depth probe in the United Kingdom after a competition watchdog on Thursday said that the deal could lead to competition concerns.\n\n\n\nThe U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it is concerned the deal could harm rivals by combining Microsoft’s leading game console, Xbox, leading cloud platform, Azure, and leading PC operating system, Windows OS, with Activision’s popular games. \n\n\n\n“We are concerned that Microsoft could use its control over popular games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft post-merger to harm rivals, including recent and future rivals in multi-game subscription services and cloud gaming,” Sorcha O’Carroll, CMA's senior director of mergers, said in a statement. \n\n\n\nThe CMA said the concerns found in the first part of the review warrant an in-depth second phase investigation, which will allow an independent panel of experts to probe the risks identified.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMicrosoft and Activision Blizzard have five days to submit proposals to address the concerns. If “suitable proposals” are not submitted, the deal will be referred to the investigation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMicrosoft President and Vice Chairman Brad Smith said the company is “ready to work with CMA on next steps and address any of its concerns.”\n\n\n\n“Sony, as the industry leader, says it is worried about Call of Duty, but we’ve said we are committed to making the same game available on the same day on both Xbox and PlayStation. We want people to have more access to games, not less,” Smith said.&nbsp;",

        "description": "President Biden on Thursday hailed plans for Micron, an Idaho-based semiconductor chip manufacturer, to invest $15 billion to build a new facility in Boise after the passage of bipartisan legislation earlier this month.\n\n\n\n“Today’s announcement by Micron is another big win for America,” Biden said, referencing recent U.S. investments announced by Toyota, Honda and Corning.\n\n\n\n“In our future, we will make [electric vehicles], chips, fiber optics, and other critical components here in America, and we will have an economy built from the bottom up and middle out,” Biden said.\n\n\n\nMicron on Thursday morning announced a roughly $15 billion investment through 2030 to build a memory manufacturing plant in Boise, where the company is headquartered.\n\n\n\n“This will be the first new memory manufacturing fab built in the U.S. in 20 years, ensuring domestic supply of leading-edge memory required for market segments like automotive and data center, fueled by accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence and 5G,” the company said in a statement.\n\n\n\nMicron said the Boise factory would be the first of multiple planned investments after the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, which passed with bipartisan support and includes more than $50 billion in incentives for manufacturers to build domestic semiconductor plants. It also includes more than $80 billion for the National Science Foundation authorized over five years to support innovation and research.\n\n\n\nBiden administration officials had for months warned of supply chain and national security risks if Congress did not invest in domestic manufacturing of chips that are used to power computers, cars and major home appliances, arguing the U.S. would become too reliant on China and others for the semiconductors.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMillennial renters' earnings are sufficient to cover rental prices in at least 13 states, specifically in the country’s interior.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut&nbsp;there is a decided gap between what is needed to afford a one bedroom in coveted coastal metros and what millennials earn.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilterbuy determined the millennial renter wage gap in a particular metro by&nbsp;calculating the percentage difference between the median earnings&nbsp;for millennial renters and the median wage needed&nbsp;to rent a one-bedroom home without spending more than 30 percent of their income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoaring housing costs and stagnant wage growth put some of the nation’s most desirable metros out of reach for many millennial renters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfter adjusting for inflation, wages have grown by 6 percent while rents have spiked 25 percent since 2014, according to a recent analysis from Filterbuy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe analysis concluded that millennial renters' earnings are sufficient to cover rental prices in at least 13 states, specifically in the country’s interior. But they found a decided gap between what is needed to afford a one bedroom in coveted coastal metros and what millennials earn.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMillennials – those between the ages of 26 and 41 – make up the largest proportion of renters in the U.S. at around 27 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFilterbuy determined the millennial renter wage gap in a particular metro by&nbsp;calculating the percentage difference between the median earnings&nbsp;for millennial renters and the median wage needed&nbsp;to rent a one-bedroom home without spending more than 30 percent of their income.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe millennial renter wage gap is highest in the California metro area encompassing Los Angeles, Long Beach and Anaheim. Here the rental wage gap is 49.5 percent. Millennials’ median wages are roughly $36,649 while the annual median wage needed to afford a one bedroom is $72,560. \n\n\n\nMillennial renters in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, Florida metro area fare slightly better than their peers in the L.A. metro with a renter wage gap of 40 percent. The median one-bedroom apartment in the Florida metro cost renters $1,308 monthly. Yet millennial renters' median annual wages of $31,414 fall short of what is necessary without spending more than 30 percent of their wages on rent. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nSan Diego-Carlsbad, CA; Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, FL; San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA round out the nation’s five metro areas where the millennial renter wage gap is the highest, according to Filterbuy’s analysis.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA separate report released by QuoteWizard in August found that close to one-fifth of Americans are worried they will face eviction in the next two months as they battle rising rents and inflation. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nEarlier data from Freddie Mac shows that&nbsp;fewer than 40 percent of Americans saw wage increases in the past year, while most experienced increases in their monthly rent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDespite rising rents and increasing costs for potential homebuyers, younger generations still view homeownership as a benchmark of success. But with increasing mortgage rates, dwindling housing availability and slow wage growth, affordability remains the central issue. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe median home price in July was more than $412,000 – up 7.7 percent from the same time last year. Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates also rose by 2.5 percent from a year earlier.",

        "description": "Spending the day rolling around on the ground with an adorable puppy sounds like a dream job, right?\nFor Carmen Gonzalez, it&#8217;s a dream come true. A photographer and award-winning former chef, she is the founder of NYC Pet Pawtographer.\nGonzalez&#8217; love for dogs began with her first dog at age four. She began her visual career in New York City as a documentary photographer. Now, as the city&#8217;s most sought after puppy picture taker, she spends her days cajoling four-legged furry models into showing off their personalities.\n\nShe shares how it all began, &#8220;My business started because of my love for dogs. While shooting New Yorkers&#8217; comings and goings, good moments and darker ones, I&#8217;d stop people walking dogs and ask if I could shoot the dogs, and then I would feature it on lnstagram. I always wanted to know the story of the dog &#8211; where did they come from, what do they like? That sort of thing. People love their dogs, and they love to tell you about them! And they always followed me on lnstagram to see their dog&#8217;s picture and pretty quickly people started asking if they could buy the image. It sort of became a business by itself.&#8221;\n\nWhile her business relies on subjects that may only sit still long enough for a few quick snaps, Gonzalez has a fool-proof method for capturing the best of a family&#8217;s beloved pet and creating frame-worthy images that grace the walls of many Upper West Side apartments. She says her secret is time.\nGonzalez explains, &#8220;One of the things I do differently from other pet photographers is that my sessions are not based on time. It is my belief that I need to give the pups as long as they want in order to get these fabulous photos. Of course, I try and do as much as I can very quickly, but I&#8217;m aware of the attention span of dogs; after two photos they&#8217;re not doing this anymore &#8211; they see a butterfly and I lose them.&#8221;\nShe continues, &#8220;I warn people it might take two days. I don&#8217;t want to force dogs to sit and run on a timetable. That&#8217;s not fair to the parents. And being tight on time may mean I couldn&#8217;t get the action shots I&#8217;m known for. I had a dog the other day and we did stunning photos, but it took us three sessions to do it. I have no problems meeting with people three times.&#8221;\nThat patience, and a willingness to pull out her yoga mat and get down on the ground with the dogs, whether it&#8217;s the middle of the park or in front of The Met, is part of what enables Gonzalez to get that great shot.\nGetting to know them makes a difference between a cute picture of a dog and one that captures everything there is to love about them. That&#8217;s her secret to getting those coveted action shots. She says, when you photograph a model or any person, you tell that person what to do &#8211; with a dog one of the things I do first thing is sit on the floor with the dog and play with them. Of course, beforehand I like to know as much as possible about the dog and what makes them happy. I want to know about their personality. But at the shoot itself I have to see how the dog is and what they want to do, and I have to tailor my plan so their happy. I do what they want basically, and they give me the best of them.\nGonzalez gave the best of herself last time she was visiting family in Puerto Rico. It was there she developed the concept of Pawlendar, a calendar featuring rescue dogs (known as satos), and partnered with United for a Cause Foundation to bring it to life. The sale of Pawlendar 2022 raised almost $20,000 for area animal shelters that had housed the calendar stars featured in each month&#8217;s spread. From the Yunque rainforest to the beaches of Vieques, the stray dogs of Puerto Rico had their moment in the sun, and hopefully a better chance at finding a forever home.\nGonzalez has another Pawlendar calendar underway for 2023, and some time on her schedule to shoot a portrait of that beloved dog who takes you for a walk every day.

        "description": "Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Kyle Muller threw seven strong innings on Wednesday evening. The Braves’ farm affiliates got some strong starting pitching performances, but those performances were not enough as the minor league squads went a combined 0-4. Kyle Muller, Dylan Dodd, and Royber Salinas were all excellent on the mound, but a lack of offense was the theme of the evening. Lets get into the games.\n\nGwinnett Stripers 2, Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp 5\nBox Score\n\nHernan Perez, LF: 1-3, HR, RBI, BB, .728 OPS\nGreyson Jenista, CF: 2-4, .663 OPS\nKyle Muller, SP: 7 IP, 6 H, 2 ER, 4 BB, 4 K, 2.96 ERA\n\n\nKyle Muller held down the fort admirably for seven innings for Gwinnett, but Jacob Webb struggled out of the bullpen and the offense could get much going in a 5-2 Stripers loss. Muller started the evening with six shutout innings and was firmly in control of the game even without his best swing and miss stuff or command. The seventh inning was less great as a walk and single with two outs both got cashed in by Jacksonville with a two-run single. Again, this wasn’t the most crisp version we have seen this season and he still managed to give the team seven strong innings. Jacob Webb, on the other hand, struggled mightily in less than an inning of work as he gave up three runs (two earned) on four hits....which is not great. \nOn offense, not much to report here other than a solo blast from Hernan Perez which was his sixth homer of the season. The only other extra base hit was a double off the bat of Alex Dickerson and Greyson Jenista, who has been forced into playing center field these days which has been...interesting at times, was the only Gwinnett batter to have a multi-hit game.\n\nMississippi Braves 1, Tennessee Smokies 3\nBox Score\n\nLogan Brown, C: 2-4, RBI, .488 OPS\nJustyn-Henry Malloy, LF: 1-2, 2 BB, .874 OPS\nDylan Dodd, SP: 6 IP, 4 H, 2 R (1 ER), 0 BB, 9 K, 3.22 ERA\n\n\nMississippi got a great start from Dylan Dodd, but a decided lack of offense (sense the theme, yet?) doomed Mississippi as they fell by the final score of 3-1. A pair of errors by Cade Bunnell in the second inning were the cause of the only trouble that Dodd faced on Wednesday as he largely mowed through the Tennessee lineup. He has not given up more than two earned runs in any start in the month of August and the zero walks and nine strikeouts were both very welcome sights for one of the better pitching prospects in the system even if he flies under the radar a bit. \nOn offense, well...they tried their best. Justyn-Henry Malloy reached base three times and Logan Brown had a pair of hits and drove in Mississippi’s only run out of the nine spot in the lineup. The top five spots in the lineup combined for one hit in the game which, generally, is not a recipe for success.\n\nRome Braves 1, Greenville Drive 3 - F/10\nBox Score \n\nBeau Philip, 3B: 1-1, 3 BB, .684 OPS\nTyler Tolve, C: 1-4, BB, R, .792 OPS\nRoyber Salinas, SP: 5 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 1 BB, 9 K, 4.37 ERA\n\n\nRome’s pitching staff performed admirably to force extra innings in this one, but again...it is hard to win when you only score one run as Rome lost by the score of 3-1. Royber Salinas got the start for Rome and looked like the guy that dominated the early part of the 2022 season as he struck out nine through five innings. Coming off a six walk start last week, it was nice to see him finding the strike zone, missing bats, and being pretty efficient as he threw just 73 pitches. Our guess is that he is a bit gassed at the end of the season here and the organization decided to limit his innings a bit. Trey Riley had a good first inning of relief in the ninth, but the tenth was less kind as he made a throwing error that scored one run, an RBI single scored another run, and he ended up with a not-so-great line overall.\nOn offense, again...not much to talk about. Beau Philip, who had started off the month of August very hot, reached base four times including three walks. Unfortunately, Rome only managed five hits in the game and they were all singles. They still had some scoring opportunities thanks to some walks, but going 1-13 with runners in scoring position generally leads to a rough night on the scoreboard.\n\nAugusta GreenJackets 4, Salem Red Sox 6\nBox Score\n\nMahki Backstrom, 1B: 2-4, 2 2B, RBI, .752 OPS\nNacho Alvarez, SS: 1-3, 2 BB, 1.106 OPS\nLandon Harper, SP: 3.2 IP, 3 H, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K, 7.36 ERA\n\n\nHey! We found a team that actually scored some runs, although it was not enough as the GreenJackets were taken down by Salem by the score of 6-4. Landon Harper got the start for Augusta and was perfectly fine as he pitched into the fourth inning did not give up a run.  James Acuna and Tyler Owens, on the other hand, were decidedly less good as they combined to give up six runs in relief. Owens’ stint was particularly brutal as he was on the mound in the top of the ninth inning with Augusta leading and he gave up a three-spot with two outs including a two-run homer.\nWe did have a bit of offense to talk about in this game. Mahki Backstrom had a pair of double and drove in a run. Mahki ended up having an .897 OPS for the month of August thanks in large part to his ability to get on base. The strikeouts remain brutal, though. Nacho Alvarez remains a guy that we are very interested as a position prospect as he reached base three more times. He also made his third start of the season at shortstop, which is very interesting given how highly his defense at third base was thought of when he was an amateur. David McCabe had a two-run double to help the cause as well.",

        "description": "Today’s Marlins news roundup also includes the departure of a talented team employee. Marlins Game Coverage\n\n\n\n\n\nMarlins Podcast Episodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday’s minor league scores: Triple-A Jacksonville won, 5-2; Double-A Pensacola won, 5-4; High-A Beloit won, 16-6; Low-A Jupiter lost, 7-4. In what I assume marks the end of his rehab assignment, Avisaíl García (Jacksonville) went 3-for-14 (a .214/.353/.357 slash line) in four games with the Jumbo Shrimp. Paul McIntosh (Pensacola) has posted a 1.002 OPS in nine games since returning from the injured list. Dalvy Rosario stood out the most during Beloit’s offensive eruption, recording four hits, including a home run.\nVenezuelan catcher Edward Duran was announced as the player to be named later in the Jordan Groshans/Anthony Bass/Zach Pop trade. As mentioned in the Dominican Summer League season review, I’m a little suspect of Duran’s defense. He’s been approximately a league-average hitter through his first two professional seasons (.254/.358/.340, 101 wRC+). Good luck to him.\n\nJesús Aguilar inked a minor league deal with the Orioles. The DH spot has been somewhat of a revolving door for them over the last month, so he figures to get occasional playing time there. The O’s will need to add Aguilar to their active roster today in order for him to be postseason eligible.\n\n\n\nIn his first start back from the IL, Trevor Rogers topped out at 98.4 mph fastball velocity, the highest of his MLB career. His velo dipped significantly in the later innings, but it was an unequivocally solid performance. He’ll stick in the Marlins rotation for the near future.\nThe Marlins finished August with a franchise-worst .196 team batting average for the month. Their best hitter during that span was...Jacob Stallings? Charles Leblanc? JJ Bleday? No good answer. \nJoin us at 7:00 p.m. ET on YouTube/Facebook/Twitter for a Marlins Jeopardy edition of Fish Stripes LIVE. Alex Aguirre of Lemon City Live is seeking a three-peat.\n\n\n\n\nAmong all players in the Southern League, Baseball America recognizes Eury Pérez as the best pitching prospect with the league’s best fastball and J.D. Orr as the best baserunner.\nJoseph Guzy is beginning a new chapter of his career after an outstanding run as Marlins team photographer. As mentioned last week, you can apply here to fill his vacant position.",

        "description": "Updated 12:30 p.m.The union representing some 15,000 nurses in the Twin Cities and Duluth said Thursday it will launch a three-day strike against 16 hospitals starting Sept. 12.The decision comes weeks after union leaders said their members voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike.The Minnesota Nurses Association leaders say they believe this is the largest private-sector nurses strike in U.S. history, and likely the largest in state history.Negotiations are ongoing, so it’s still possible a walkout can be avoided, but nursing leaders Thursday described current circumstances as a crisis.“The hospitals will tell you that there is a nursing shortage and they are unable to hire nurses. There is no nursing shortage in Minnesota. Just a shortage of nurses willing to work in this unsafe environment where we cannot give the quality care that we know our patients deserve,” Children&#x27;s Minnesota nurse Tracey Dittrich told reporters as the union announced its strike plan Thursday morning.In addition to staffing, the union says wage increases and nurse retention are concerns among nurses. Hospital administrators have said they are offering several percentage point raises to nurses and they&#x27;ve tried to address the other issues.Nurses have been working without a contract since early summer.  In a statement, the affected hospitals in the Twin Cities said they will remain open and that negotiators would continue to work toward “reasonable agreements and avoid any actions that would interrupt patient care.”In a separate statement, Allina Health said it was disappointed by the union’s decision to “rush to a strike before exhausting all options” and that talk had “made progress this week.” The hospital system said it’s offered a pay and benefits package that includes an 11 percent wage increase over three years along with a commitment to workplace safety and recruitment and retention. The union said these are the hospitals and systems facing a strike:M Health Fairview system, Twin Cities areaRiversideSouthdaleSt. Joseph&#x27;sSt. John&#x27;sEssentia Health, Duluth areaSt. Mary&#x27;s DuluthSt. Mary&#x27;s SuperiorEssentia Moose LakeAllina Health, Twin Cities areaAbbott NorthwesternMercyUnitedUnityChildren’s Minnesota, Twin Cities Children&#x27;s MinneapolisChildren&#x27;s St. PaulSt. Luke&#x27;s, Duluth St. Luke&#x27;sNorth Memorial, Twin Cities areaNorth MemorialHealthPartners, Twin Cities areaMethodist",

        "description": "12:23pm: The Twins announced that Hamilton&#8217;s contract has been selected and that lefty Austin Davis, whom they claimed off waivers from the Red Sox earlier this week, has been added to the active roster. Outfielder Trevor Larnach was moved from the 10-day IL to the 60-day IL to open a 40-man spot for Hamilton. Larnach has been out more than 60 days already after undergoing surgery to repair a sports hernia back in late June, so the move to the 60-day IL is a pure formality. The Twins are still hopeful that he can return this month.\n8:53am: The Twins are set to select the contract of veteran speedster Billy Hamilton, as first reported by TwinsDaily&#8217;s Ted Schwerzler. It&#8217;s an off-day for Minnesota, but Hamilton will be with the team for tomorrow&#8217;s series opener against the division-rival White Sox, tweets Darren Wolfson of 1500 SKOR North radio. The team will need to make a corresponding 40-man roster move for Hamilton, as they&#8217;re currently at capacity.\nHamilton, 32 next week, signed a minor league deal with the Twins last month after declining an outright assignment with the Marlins, for whom he went 1-for-13 while appearing in 20 games (mostly as a defensive replacement) earlier this summer. He&#8217;ll be joining his eighth Major League team when he suits up for Minnesota. The longtime Reds center fielder is considered one of the best defensive players in the sport and will give the Twins two of the game&#8217;s most dynamic outfield gloves once Byron Buxton returns from the 10-day IL. (He&#8217;s eligible this weekend, though the team has not yet indicated when he&#8217;ll be reinstated.)\nHamilton&#8217;s blistering speed and glovework helped to overshadow perennial lackluster showings at the plate for the first several seasons of his career in Cincinnati. He hit just .244/.297/.332 in 2714 plate appearances from 2014-18 but remained the Reds&#8217; everyday option in center thanks to his glove and an average of 53 stolen bases per season. His offense fell off even harder in 2019, however, and the switch-hitting Hamilton has moved into journeyman status, batting a combined .209/.266/.293 in 539 plate appearances spread across six teams in the past four years.\nWith the Twins, Hamilton will provide a valuable late-game defensive replacement and pinch-running option as Minnesota looks to close a 1.5-game deficit and retake the AL Central lead from the Guardians. And, at least for now, with Buxton, Trevor Larnach and Alex Kirilloff all on the injured list &#8212; Kirilloff&#8217;s season is over, following August wrist surgery &#8212; there could be some additional opportunities to make a few starts. At present, the Twins have shortstop-turned-outfielder Nick Gordon in left field, Gilberto Celestino in center and stalwart Max Kepler in right field. Kyle Garlick gives them a corner option against left-handed pitching, and lefty-swinging Jake Cave gives them another outfielder capable of playing any of the three positions.\nBecause Hamilton was in the organization prior to Sept. 1, he&#8217;ll be postseason-eligible, although the fact that he wasn&#8217;t on the 40-man roster as of midnight last night means he&#8217;d require league approval as postseason replacement for a player on the injured list. Still, teams make such swaps every year, so if Minnesota ultimately qualifies for the playoffs and wants to roster Hamilton as a bench option, they&#8217;ll be able to do so.",

If you’re new to iOS or just haven’t had this happen before, you may not know how to actually quit an app (as opposed to just swiping it off your screen). Here’s how to quit an app and, if you need to, shut down your phone. (We used a phone loaded with a beta of iOS 16, but this will work with earlier versions of the OS just as well.)\nQuit an app\n\nOpen the App Switcher by either swiping up from the bottom of the screen and then pausing in the middle or (if you have a Home button) double pressing the Home button.\nYou’ll see an overlapping view of all your open apps.

        "description": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) announced Wednesday that the first bus of migrants from the southern border has arrived in the city of Chicago.\n\n\n\nIn a news release on Wednesday, Abbott said the migrants were dropped off at the city’s Union Station.\n\n\n\nAbbott has been sending migrants to major Democratic-run cities in recent months in protest of the Biden administration's immigration policies. Buses previously dropped off migrants in Washington, D.C., and New York City. \n\n\n\n\"President Biden's inaction at our southern border continues putting the lives of Texans — and Americans — at risk and is overwhelming our communities,\" Abbott said in his statement Wednesday. \n\n\n\n\"To continue providing much-needed relief to our small, overrun border towns, Chicago will join fellow sanctuary cities Washington, D.C. and New York City as an additional drop-off location.”\n\n\n\nAbbott also said that he hopes Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) will take responsibility for supporting the migrants upon arrival. \n\n\n\n“Mayor Lightfoot loves to tout the responsibility of her city to welcome all regardless of legal status, and I look forward to seeing this responsibility in action as these migrants receive resources from a sanctuary city with the capacity to serve them,” Abbott concluded.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn her own statement, Lightfoot said on Wednesday that her administration will work with community partners to ensure that the migrants will receive food, shelter and protection, noting that they will not stand on the “racist practices” Abbott and his administration are currently doing. \n\n\n\n\"This is not new; Chicago welcomes hundreds of migrants every year to out city and provides much-needed assistance,\" she said in the statement. \"Unfortunately, Texas Governor Greg Abbott is without any shame or humanity. But ever since he put these racists practices of expulsion in place, we have been working with our community partners to ready the city to receive these individuals.\"\n\n\n\nNew York City officials have expressed their disdain over Abbott’s busing initiative, claiming that the governor placed wristbands with barcodes on migrants who were bused to the city as an intimidation tactic. \n\n\n\n“We know that Gov. Abbott has been trying to dehumanize people, trying to foment anti-immigrant hatred, and while New York will continue to welcome asylum seekers, it’s also our moral responsibility to denounce this kind of behavior by Gov. Abbott,” Manuel Castro, New York City's commissioner of immigrant affair, said last week.",

        "description": "President Biden spoke with Democrat Mary Peltola on Wednesday night to congratulate her on her victory in the special election for Alaska's vacant at-large seat in the House of Representatives, according to the White House.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The two had a very warm conversation where he told her he looks forward to working with her to lower costs for working families in Alaska when she is sworn into her seat in Congress,” the White House said. “He also wished her a very&nbsp;happy birthday.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPeltola, a former state lawmaker, defeated former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) by about 3 percentage points in a major upset on Wednesday, becoming the first Alaska Native elected to Congress. The White House statement did not mention Palin explicitly. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nPeltola was declared the winner of the special election on Wednesday night in a vote that was the first test of the state’s new ranked-choice voting system. Republican Nick Begich was also on the ballot, but his votes were redistributed to Peltola and Palin after an earlier round was tabulated.\n\n\n\nThe special election is likely to further fuel Democratic hopes ahead of the November midterm elections, though Palin’s controversial persona was thought to be a significant factor in the race. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nPeltola, Palin and Begich will all appear again on the ballot in November for the general election for the next full two-year term. That election will also use ranked-choice voting. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden has periodically called Democrats who have emerged victorious in primaries or other elections to congratulate them on their wins.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) is polling neck and neck with Republican Senate challenger Joe O’Dea just two months ahead of the November midterms, according to a new GOP poll released on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe poll, commissioned by the Republican Attorneys General Association and conducted by GOP strategist Dave Sackett of The Tarrance Group and shared with the Washington Examiner by the Colorado Republican Party, showed Bennet with 48 percent support among likely registered voters compared to the construction company executive with 47 percent.\n\n\n\nA separate 5 percent said they were undecided. The polling falls within the margin of error, which is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points, essentially tying the two candidates.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmong independent voters polled, Bennet received 49 percent compared to O’Dea’s 44 percent.\n\n\n\nBennet is seeking a third term in the upper chamber against O’Dea in a race that the nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates as “lean Democrat.” Bennet won his first term by less than a percentage point in 2010 and won reelection in 2016 by 5 percentage points.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nO’Dea has cast himself as a political outsider, winning his GOP primary in late June against state Rep. Ron Hanks, who was on Capitol grounds on the day of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot and has questioned the 2020 election results.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nO'Dea made headlines earlier this month when he said he wouldn’t endorse former President Trump.\n\n\n\n“As far as Trump’s concerned, I hope he doesn’t run,” O’Dea said during a radio interview.&nbsp; “I don’t want to see him as president.”\n\n\n\nThe poll was conducted Aug. 22-25 with 600 likely registered voters polled. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Remember how promising things looked for Republicans when summer was arriving? Remember how confident they were about the red wave that was supposed to wipe out Democrats in this fall’s midterms? They even threw in the word “tsunami” to make sure everyone knew what level of catastrophe was awaiting those woke lefties. Well, summer is now on the way out and a new reality is on the way in. Republicans aren’t feeling all that spunky anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEven a column in the conservative Washington Examiner is asking, “Is the red wave already crashing?” Under that headline we get a political reality check: “The mood has shifted among Republicans over the past several weeks, from a sense of unbridled optimism to one of sober reflection about their chances for victory.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo, if we’re to believe what passes for the prevailing wisdom, Democratic prospects for November have been miraculously resurrected. And, yes, it’s true that President Biden’s poll numbers have gone up recently — from abysmal to merely lousy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd so, to what should we attribute this revival of Democratic fortunes (if that’s what it really is)? Well, there’s the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade in June, which we’re led to believe has fired up the enthusiasm of a lot of women voters.\n\n\n\nWhen summer began, gasoline prices were heading north and Republicans were falling over each other trying to get in front of a TV camera to let everyone know it was all the fault of anti-fossil fuel Democrats. Now gasoline prices at the pump, while still historically high, are coming down — good news for the American consumer, but not so good for Republican politicians.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd there have been some legislative victories for the Democrats — laws that were designed to reduce gun violence and supposedly deal with both climate change and inflation at the same time. Going into the summer, Democratic voters were — let’s call it — underwhelmed. Now, who knows, they actually may be energized. The enthusiasm gap that was a chasm a few months ago may be shrinking as we approach fall.\n\n\n\nAnd then, of course, there’s the gift that keeps on giving for Democrats: Donald Trump. He endorsed a slew of rookie (and some would say, less than scintillating) GOP Senate candidates in key battleground states who aren’t doing all that well at the moment. According to polls, they’re trailing in Pennsylvania and Arizona, and barely ahead in Georgia and Ohio, a state that has gone reliably red in recent years.\n\n\n\nSo now, with the midterms just two months away, you could make a case that it’s not looking especially good for Republicans to take over the Senate — and even the apparent rock-solid lead the GOP had in House races at the beginning of summer isn’t looking so rock-solid now that summer is waning.\n\n\n\nFor all this, the Democrats should send Donald Trump flowers and a gift basket filled with all sorts of goodies. If there ever has been another defeated U.S. president who has put his party’s electoral chances in such a precarious state, I don’t know who he is. Way to go, Mr. Former President.\n\n\n\nBut it’s only September and Republicans do have a few things working in their favor. We may already be in a recession, crime is still a big issue, and so is the non-stop influx of illegal immigrants at our southern border.\n\n\n\nAnd now we have Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan, which may not even be legal. I can’t see how that’s going to play well with folks who scrimped and saved and paid off their student loans — or anyone who didn’t go to college and is wondering why he’s subsiding people who did.\n\n\n\nIn politics, two months is an eternity, and so, a lot can happen between now and November — and probably will. The raid at Trump’s resort in Florida is still big news and the House committee looking into his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the Capitol will resume hearings this month — just in time to influence how swing voters feel about our former president and Republicans in general.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd right on cue, just a few days ago, Trump took to social media to declare “the 2020 Election irreparably compromised.” He demanded that we “have a new Election, immediately!”\n\n\n\nAs I say, he’s the gift to Democrats that keeps on giving, which is why they want the midterm elections to be not about inflation or crime or illegal immigration but about Donald Trump. And knowing how much Trump craves being the center of attention, it’s not crazy to think he just might want the same thing.\n\n\n\nDemocrats can only hope. Republicans can only worry.\n\n\n\nBernard Goldberg is an Emmy and an Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University award-winning writer and journalist.

        "description": "Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) is criticizing members of his own party who have suggested certain candidates  the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) has backed might not fair well in this fall's midterm elections. \n\n\n\n\"Unfortunately, many of the very people responsible for losing the Senate last cycle are now trying to stop us from winning the majority this time by trash-talking our Republican candidates,\" Scott wrote in an op-ed published in the conservative Washington Examiner this week. \n\n\n\n\"It’s an amazing act of cowardice, and ultimately, it’s treasonous to the conservative cause. Giving anonymous quotes to help the&nbsp;Washington Post&nbsp;or the&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;write stories trashing Republicans is the same as working with the Democratic National Committee.\" \n\n\n\nThe chair of the NRSC did not call out any elected officials or Republican pundits by name, but said \"much of Washington's chattering class disrespects and secretly (or not so secretly) loathes Republican voters.\"\n\n\n\nScott's comments appear to be the latest in a simmering feud with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who last month turned heads in Republican circles when he suggested the House is more likely to flip into GOP control than the Senate. \n\n\n\n“I think there’s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. Senate races are just different — they’re statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,” McConnell said. \n\n\n\nThose comments earned a sharp rebuke from former President Trump, who has spent much of his time post-White House campaigning and fundraising for Republicans loyal to him, including a number of candidates in tight swing-state Senate races. \n\n\n\n\"Let me be clear — we will overcome the Washington naysayers and their anonymous quotes, we will beat the Democrats, and we will take control of the Senate this fall. Write it down,\" Scott said Thursday.\n\n\n\n\"And when we do, we will be in a position to stop this confused and ridiculous president from further damaging our great country and present a positive agenda that will be good for all of America. As a side benefit, we will be able to ignore the fools who have been trash-talking Republican candidates and Republican voters.\"",

        "description": "Tides may be shifting for Democrats ahead of this year’s midterm elections, as the party has seen an uptick over Republicans on a generic congressional ballot. \n\n\n\nA Wall Street Journal poll, released Thursday, found Democrats with a 3-point edge over Republicans when voters were asked which party they’d back in their congressional district if the midterms were held today, 47 to 44. \n\n\n\nRepublicans were ahead five points as recently as March, when a similar WSJ poll found 46 percent of voters would back a Republican, compared to 41 percent who said they’d cast their ballot for the Democrats.\n\n\n\nForty-four percent of voters in the new poll favorably viewed the Democratic Party as a whole, up 4 points since March. Forty percent viewed the Republican party the same way, down 4 points since March.\n\n\n\nThe new report cites higher approval ratings for President Biden and increased support for Democrats among women, younger voters, Black and Hispanic voters and independent voters as key factors in the Democrats’ potential momentum shift.\n\n\n\nForty-five percent of voters reported a favorable view of Biden, up from 41 percent in March.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy contrast, 39 percent reported the same of Trump, down from 41 percent in March.\n\n\n\nThe earlier poll had found independents favored a Republican candidate over a Democrat for Congress by 12 percentage points, but Democrats are now ahead by 3 points, 38 to 35 percent.\n\n\n\nAbortion was a top issue for voters, along with the economy and inflation, but the recent Supreme Court decision overturning the right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade was the top issue cited as making voters more likely to cast their ballot in November’s congressional election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt 34 percent, abortion was more popular as a spur to vote than inflation and rising prices (28 percent), illegal immigration and border security (15 percent), gun violence (9 percent) and the FBI’s search of former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home (8 percent).\n\n\n\nConducted Aug. 17-25 by Impact Research and Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates, the WSJ poll surveyed 1,313 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points.",

        "description": "Photo by Jayne Kamin-Oncea/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Rancho won a wild on in San Bernardino After a brief stop with Low-A Rancho Cucamonga last week, Danny Duffy moved his rehab assignment to Triple-A Oklahoma City Wednesday as he is attempting to be ready in some capacity for the Dodgers in the last month of the season.\nDuffy pitched a perfect sixth inning, striking out all three batters on 14 pitches. The left-hander had a flexor tendon injury that required surgery in October and hasn’t appeared in a major league game since July 16 of last season as a member of the Royals.\nNow let’s take a look at the rest of the action, including three close losses and a wild win in 10 innings.\nPlayer of the day\nThe Dodgers’ 2022 fourth-round pick (135 overall) Nick Biddison had the best night of his brief career to this point, driving in four runs on five hits to help Rancho to win in extra innings.\nPlaying both the outfield and infield Wednesday, Biddison was 5-for-6 with two doubles and a triple. The 22-year-old brought in a run on a sac fly in the first, a two-run triple in the fifth and drove in the game’s final run with a single in the 10th.\nIn 22 games since being added to the Quakes Roster at the beginning of August, Biddison is 27-for-87 (.310) with two homers, two triple and six RBI, good for a .913 OPS.\nTriple-A Oklahoma City\nOklahoma City twice had a lead Wednesday but two runs in the eighth for Round Rock (Rangers) proved to be the difference, sending the Dodgers to a 7-6 loss on the road in Texas.\nAfter a strikeout and a walk, reliever Carson Fulmer came on to protect the 6-5 lead for OKC. Fulmer struck out the first batter he faced but allowed a double and a single to give Round Rock the two crucial runs.\nThe Dodgers got five of their six runs by way of the long ball, with Jacob Amaya hitting a two-run homer in the top of the fifth to break a scoreless tie and Jason Martin smashing a three-run job in the sixth.\n\n\nNothing dirty about this 30!Jason Martin hits his 30th homer of the season to tie the game in the 5th inning! pic.twitter.com/WTMM6mnM1t— Oklahoma City Dodgers (@okc_dodgers) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nHowever, in between those big hits for OKC, the Express strung together four hits and five runs in the home half of the fifth.\nMartin finished 2-for-4 with the home run and a double to give him a league-leading 30 homers and 102 RBI on the year. It was the third consecutive night with a long ball for Martin.\nThe Dodgers gained the lead in the sixth on a run-scoring groundout from James Outman, who disappointingly didn’t hit for another cycle.\nGavin Stone made his second start with OKC since being promoted August 16. The right-hander held Round Rock scoreless in 3 1⁄3 innings, giving up two hits and three walks while striking out seven of the 15 batters he faced.\nDouble-A Tulsa\nTulsa scored three runs in the seventh to tie the game at five apiece but a solo home run in the ninth for Northwest Arkansas proved to be the final blow. The Drillers went in order in their half of the ninth to drop a 6-5 contest to the Naturals.\nIt was a battle of two players on offense, with Abiatal Avelino driving in three for the Drillers and Robbie Glendinning knocking in five for the Naturals.\nAvelino singled in a run in the second to give Tulsa a 1-0 lead that was immediately erased by Glendinning’s three-run homer in the third. After Justin Yurchak singled in a run for the Drillers in the sixth, Glendinning extended the deficit with a two-run double.\n\n\nOppo   blast for Abiatal Avelino! His 6th home run of the season brings the Drillers back to within one run.Drillers ⬇️ 5-4 in the 7th. pic.twitter.com/ClDW53Iuv6— Tulsa Drillers (@TulsaDrillers) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nAvelino hit a two-run homer in the seventh and Tulsa would later tie it in the inning when Leonel Valera stole third and came in to score on a wild throw by catcher Luca Tresh.\nTucker Bradley put the Naturals up for good with a solo shot in the ninth.\nAvelino and catcher Carson Taylor finished 2-for-4 on the night.\nHigh-A Great Lakes\nGreat Lakes had very little happening on offense Wednesday night. The Loons were limited to one hit and few baserunners on their way to a 2-0 loss at the hands of Lake County (Guardians).\nAfter the Captains scored a run in the top of the first, the Loons put runners at first and second with two outs on a Jorbit Vivas single and Damon Keith walk. But a flyout ended the inning and Great Lakes would go without a hit the rest of the way. Keith would walk twice in four trips to the plate for the Loons.\nThe only other chance to get some kind of rally together happened in the fourth when Ismael Alcantara was hit by a pitch and ended up at third on a throwing error that allowed Imanol Vargas to reach. It came with two outs again and Luis Diaz struck out to end the threat.\nLake County retired 16 of the final 18 Loons to hit, completing the shutout.\nLost in the shuffle is the five solid innings turned in by Carlos Duran for Great Lakes. The right-hander struck out six and allowed just one run on four hits and two walks to keep the Loons in it.\nLow-A Rancho Cucamonga\nRancho and Inland Empire combined for 32 hits and 30 runs in a game that needed 10 innings to be decided. The Quakes scored two runs in the top of the 10th to keep their playoff hopes alive with a 16-14 win.\nBoth teams scored in bunches all game but it was a seven-run fifth inning that saw 10 men come to the plate for Rancho that propelled the Quakes to stay in this contest and eventually come out on top. It amazingly all came after there were two outs in the inning.\nWith Rancho down 9-4 entering the frame, Kyle Froemke reached on a throwing error and the next two batters made out. Jake Vogel doubled, Yeiner Fernandez singled, Dalton Rushing reached on an error and Biddison tripled to put the tying run at third. Bubba Alleyne tied the game at nine with an RBI-single and Griffin Lockwood-Powell went deep to cap the inning by giving the Quakes a two-run advantage.\nRancho took a 14-12 lead into the bottom of the ninth but Adrian Placencia tied it on a two-run home run to force extra innings. \nVogel and Biddison kept their big nights going into the free baseball portion of the night, each singling home a run in the 10th to help close out the win.\nSee above for Biddison’s five-hit effort and Vogel finished the night 4-for-6 with a double, three singles, a walk and four RBI. Amazingly, only three other players had multiple hits in the game for the Quakes in a 19-hit outburst.\n18-year-old Rayne Doncon went 2-for-5 with two RBI and a walk in his fifth game since joining Rancho last week. Doncon is 6-for-20 (.300) in the last four games after an 0-for-4 debut.\nTransactions\nTriple-A: Los Angeles Dodgers sent LHP Danny Duffy on a rehab assignment to Oklahoma City Dodgers.\nLow-A: LHP Luis Valdez assigned to Rancho Cucamonga Quakes from ACL Dodgers.\nWednesday scores\n\nRound Rock 7, Oklahoma City 6\nNorthwest Arkansas 6, Tulsa 5\nLake County 2, Great Lakes 0\nRancho Cucamonga 16, Inland Empire 14\n\nThursday Schedule\n\n4:05 p.m. PT: Great Lakes (Adolfo Ramirez) vs. Lake County (Tommy Mace)\n4:35 p.m.: Oklahoma City (Bobby Miller) at Round Rock (Tyson Miller)\n5:05 p.m.: Tulsa (TBD) vs. Northwest Arkansas (Andrew Hoffmann)\n7:05 p.m.: Rancho Cucamonga (Justin Wrobleski) at Inland Empire (Chase Chaney)",

        "description": "Amsterdam Avenue, 70th and 71st. Photographs by Ed Hersh.\nBy Ed Hersh\nWith complaints about massive piles of garbage, fears about crime and the proliferation of smoke shops, concerns about bicycles on the sidewalk and the impact of congestion pricing on the neighborhood, a steady stream of residents queued up to meet one on one with Council Member Gale Brewer on the west side of Amsterdam Avenue, between 70th and 71st Streets, late Tuesday afternoon. It was billed as a “Pop-up District Office,&#8221; and Brewer got an earful.\n“I targeted it because it is known as a problem block,” she said, noting she has long received complaints about it, even before the pandemic.\nThe block has both a CBD store and a smoke shop (Lincoln Convenience was robbed twice recently, once involving a shooting), a pizza place, and a McDonalds. It’s a block where pedestrians must run a gauntlet of obstacles: a giant rack filled with delivery bikes, piles of trash, outdoor tables, a COVID pop-up testing tent, a food truck, and a sidewalk fruit vendor.\nCouncil Member Gale Brewer.\nBrewer wanted to hear directly from residents. “I do not feel safe in my neighborhood or getting on the subway,” one woman told her. Another asked, “Why are pot stores allowed to stay open 24 hours a day?” Andrea Sholl, a Lincoln Towers resident, pressed the point. “I resent that the [smoke shops] are open 24 hours a day. PS 199 is right around the block and there are three schools in a two-block area.”\nAn architect asked, “Why do all these bicycles have to be locked up in the middle of the block?” Several were upset about the impact of congestion pricing and what it would mean for their ability to &#8220;visit family in New Jersey&#8221; or &#8220;have access to parking spaces.&#8221;\nIn each case, Brewer listened, took notes, and gave out her card for follow up with her staff. But the issues on the block are complex, Brewer told us afterward, involving multiple city agencies, the police, and the building that houses the establishments itself, 201 West 71st Street.\n“I’m going to have a stakeholders meeting to see what we can do together to improve this block,” she said. In addition to the NYPD, that meeting will include representatives of the departments of transportation and sanitation, the community board, business owners, and building management.\nBrewer believes it is important for her to hold these pop-ups from time to time. “You really get a sense of what’s on people’s minds,” she said. “People will open up to you when it’s one on one.”",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Mets tried something new, and it was a resounding success. With the narrowest of leads against the team with the best record in baseball, the Mets were all in. Having already turned Edwin Díaz entrances to “Narco” into a beloved event at Citi Field, the team took it up a notch, as Timmy Trumpet played his signature part of the song live on the field as Díaz made his way in from the bullpen. And the 28-year-old closer followed up the electric musical performance with one of his own on the mound, retiring the side in order to secure a win for the Mets.\nBaseball and music are two of the very best things on the planet to see in person, but there’s always been something a bit clunky about big ballpark concerts. The shows are immensely popular, but as far the actual concert goes, putting a stage in center field doesn’t exactly lend itself to the best listening or viewing experience from the average seat. \nThere have been other game-related live music performances in the past, of course. The Mets have always tapped into a wide variety of talented performers to sing the national anthem. They’ve tried putting bands on the concourse at Citi Field for people to listen to as they walk around before a game. There was a post-game concert series that featured bands playing relatively brief sets of music that would start shortly after the Mets finished playing baseball.\nBut last night, the Mets blended live music and baseball perfectly. It made the crowd go to eleven, if you will. The fact that Trumpet could be deployed at a moment’s notice and play his part—with foul territory serving as his natural stage—made him fit right in with the game. It was a resounding success, one that gave the Mets another moment to remember in a season that has featured a lot of them.",

(credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA confirmed Wednesday that it has awarded five additional crew transportation missions to SpaceX, and its Crew Dragon vehicle, to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station. This brings to 14 the total number of crewed missions that SpaceX is contracted to fly for NASA through 2030.\nAs previously reported by Ars, these are likely the final flights NASA needs to keep the space station fully occupied into the year 2030. While there are no international agreements yet signed, NASA has signaled that it would like to continue flying the orbiting laboratory until 2030, by which time one or more US commercial space stations should be operational in low Earth orbit.\n\nUnder the new agreement, SpaceX would fly 14 crewed missions to the station on Crew Dragon, and Boeing would fly six during the lifetime of the station. That would be enough to fill all of NASA's needs, which include two launches a year, carrying four astronauts each. But NASA has an option to buy more seats from either provider.Read 12 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Scores, news, and notes, from around the Detroit Tigers’ farm system for Wednesday, August 31, 2022. Toledo Mud Hens 5, Rochester Red Wings 4 (box)\nElvin Rodriguez put together a good outing, and a pair of solo shots proved the margin of victory as the Red Wings mounted a late comeback on Wednesday.\nRodriguez tossed six innings of two run ball to start the Hens on the right foot. He scattered five hits, and crucially did not walk a batter, punching out five. Brendon Davis opened the scoring with a solo shot, his eighth homer for the Hens, in the first inning. It was Davis again in the third as the infielder singled and scored on a Spencer Torkelson single to make it 2-0. \nAfter Rodriguez lost the lead in the fourth, Andre Lipcius came up with his second home run in as many days to re-open a one-run lead. RBI hits from Ali Sanchez and Jack Lopez in the eighth made it 5-2 Hens, and reliever Nick Vincent survived a two-run bottom of the ninth from the Red Wings to hang on for the save.\n\n\nAndre Lipcius gives the Mud Hens the lead once again with a frozen rope over the left field wall. It’s his 11th home run of the season, and his 2nd in as many days. pic.twitter.com/Nmm5vpOLKe— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) August 31, 2022\n\n\n\nLipcius: 2-3, R, RBI, HR, BB\nDavis: 2-4, 2 R, RBI, HR\nLopez: 2-4, RBI, 2 2B\nRodriguez (W, 6-3): 6.0 IP, 2 ER, 5 H, 0 BB, 5 SO\nComing Up Next: RHP Austin Bergner (1-1, 3.18 ERA) starts for Toledo on Thursday night. The Red Wings are yet to announce.\nBowie Baysox 15, Erie SeaWolves 5 (box)\nBowie jumped all over Brent Hurter in this one, knocking him out of the game in the third inning, then went on to pummel the bullpen in a convincing victory Wednesday.\nHurter was ultimately charged for five earned runs and couldn’t record on out in the third inning. Reliever Bubba Derby didn’t do any better, and the Baysox led 8-0 after the top of the fourth inning. \nThe SeaWolves couldn’t really fight back at that point. Both Parker Meadows and Gage Workman stayed hot, launching solo shots in the fourth and the seventh inning, respectively. Things just got worse and worse for Erie’s pen as the night progressed, and it wasn’t until the bottom of the ninth that the SeaWolves managed a rally, pushing across three runs to make this look a little more respectable. Trei Cruz reached base three times in his second Double-A game, continuing a pretty good second half.\n\n\nParker Meadows with an absolute bomb off lefty Cade Povich to get the @erie_seawolves on the board. It’s his 16th home run with Erie, and his 20th overall this season. pic.twitter.com/YMuw5K9OOE— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) August 31, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nGage Workman stays hot with a rocket over the wall in left center. It’s his 13th home run of the season. @Greg_Gania on the call. pic.twitter.com/wLmhkWcWd6— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nMeadows: 1-4, R, 2 RBI, HR, SO\nWorkman: 2-4, R, RBI, HR, SO\nCruz: 2-3, R, BB\nComing Up Next: The two clubs will meet up Thursday night at 6:05 p.m. EDT. \nWest Michigan Whitecaps 6, Fort Wayne TinCaps 4 (box)\nThe Whitecaps offense came out hot in this one to make it two in a row over Fort Wayne on Wednesday.\nGarrett Burhenn got the start in this one, with lefty Carlos Pena, just up from Lakeland, piggybacking Burhenn’s short start. Burhenn allowed a pair of runs in the first inning, settling in to strike out five over three innings of work. Pena took over and collecting seven outs, six by strikeout. He allowed one run along the way to get the Whitecaps into the late innings. \nThey built an early lead courtesy of Danny Serretti, who is off to a hot start in pro ball and was just promoted from Lakeland for this series. Serretti scored from first on a Jake Holton double in the first to open the scoring. In the second, after Fort Wayne seized a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the first, Josh Crouch led off with a walk and scored on a Ben Malgeri triple. Carlos Mendoza walked and Malgeri scored on an Esney Chacon ground ball that forced Mendoza at second. A double from Serretti moved Chacon to third, where he scored on a wild pitch, making it 4-2 Whitecaps. \n\n\nDanny Serretti made his High-A debut today. Here are all 5 of his plate appearances. pic.twitter.com/34NyI1mzt1— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nIn the fourth, a double steal by Malgeri and Mendoza put runners on second and third for Serretti, and he came through again with a two-run double to make it 6-2. In the bottom half of the fourth, Pena allowed a pair of singles and a walk to load the bases, but allowed just one run, striking out a pair in a tight spot to escape the jam. From there the Whitecaps had the game under control.\nSerretti: 2-4, R, 2 RBI, 2 2B, 2 SO\nMalgeri: 2-4, 2 R, RBI, 3B\nMendoza: 0-1, R, 3 BB, SO\nPena (W, 1-0): 2.1 IP, ER, 2 H, 2 BB, 6 SO\nComing Up Next: RHP Keider Montero (6-7, 5.00 ERA) takes on RHP Ryan Bergert (3-9, 5.92 ERA) on Thursday night. \nLakeland Flying Tigers vs. Clearwater Threshers (postponed)\nThe weather didn’t cooperate in Lakeland on Wednesday. They’ll play two on Thursday to make up the game. First pitch is set for 4:00 p.m. EDT.",

But it was the kind of love that can be hard to explain.She hadn’t lost a blood relative, or a friend. Instead, the funeral was for the first wife of my friend’s much-married father, a woman for whom – unlike a cousin or a sibling or even a step-parent – there isn’t an official word. But still, she was family, the beloved mother of my friend’s equally beloved older half-sisters, a fixture in all of their long-interwoven lives, even though they had never all lived together under one roof. As always in grief, it isn’t only love for the deceased that brings us together, but love for the living and bereaved.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...",

        "description": "I run a lot. Last month, I reached my fourth consecutive annual kilomile. And yet, for all that running, the very longest distances I compete in are marathons. 26.2 miles is more than enough for me.\n\nThere’s another breed of runners who compete in ultramarathons, races which are 50, 100, 200 miles (and even longer). Courtney Dauwalter is probably the world’s greatest ultrarunner, female or male. How does she do it? Why does she do it?\n\nOutsiders can’t always understand why she would put herself through something like this—or why anyone would. If only they could stand with her on these mountains after a run, out of breath and full of fire, feeling the profound satisfaction that comes from putting one’s body on the line to see how strong one’s mind can be.\n\nThat satisfaction is certainly a motivator. But another factor is the persistent exploration of the pain cave, as Mirin Fader details in a tremendous profile for The Ringer. The distances Dauwalter and her fellow adventurers run can seem unfathomable, but the mental battles they wage can be relevant to all of us.Link: https://www.theringer.com/sports/2022/8/30/23323367/courtney-dauwalter-ultra-running-marathon",

        "description": "The AirPods Max are the most premium listening device offered by Apple, but don’t pay full price. | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge\n    \n\n  Holy hell, it’s September. A major Apple event is next week, and summer is pretty much over (except for the crippling heat, that is). Before you know it, we’ll be talking about “Techtober” and holiday shopping. Wait, before you throw your keyboard or phone at me, I’ll get to the deals.\nFirst up, you can pick up the AirPods Max in select colors (silver, pink, blue, and green) for $429, which is a cool $120 off their full price. This is the best possible price for a new pair of AirPods Max so far. They are regularly discounted to $479, so you should never pay full price, but this deal doesn’t come around all the time.\nWhile $429 is still a sizable amount for headphones, the noise-canceling AirPods Max are some of the best options around...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

Scores and notes from the Cincinnati Reds farm from the games played on Wednesday, August 31st, 2022, the final day of August as it’s now September 2022 and I’m still stuck thinking it’s about April 2020.\nTo the scores!\n\nIndianapolis Indianapolisians 6, Louisville Bats 2 (AAA)\nThe Bats lost. They do that, in case you haven’t noticed. Haven’t had a winning season since 2011. Funny how a big league franchise that can’t get out of its own way has also managed to lug around a AAA affiliate also un-stocked with enough talent to win for a similar amount of time. Anyway, Louisville scored twice in the Bottom of the 1st and never again, with the 2-run bonk by Stephen “PisTeflon Don” Piscotty plating Spencer Steer early before Indianapolis could get their bats a-swingin’. \nPensacola Blue Wahoos 5, Chattanooga Lookouts 4 (AA)\nPensacola put a 3-spot on the board in the Top of the 8th against Chattanooga reliever Ryan “Sometimes you feel like a” Nutof, and that proved to be the decisive frame in the game. Christian Roa had a rock solid effort as the starter (5.0 IP, 3 H, ER, 2 BB, 6 K), while both Garrett “Wall Street” Wolforth and Mike Siani socked homers. Christian Encarnacion-Strand continued his white hot hitting with another pair of hits and a ribbie, while Elly De La Cruz chipped in with a walk, a pair of steals, and a run scored. \nDayton Dragons 9, Cedar Rapids Kernels 4 (High-A)\nThe Dragons put up a 5-spot in the Bottom of the 1st and never looked back on Wednesday. Tyler “Not Austin” Callihan had a monster day at the plate, going 4 for 5 with a homer, a double, a trio of runs scored, and 4 ribbies, while ahead of him in the lineup Noelvi Marte doubled, walked twice, swiped a bag, and scored twice. Austin “Not Tyler” Hendrick walked a trio of times, which is awesome, while Jay Allen II walked, stole a bag, and scored twice. Fun lineup, this one is.\nPalm Beach Cardinals 6, Daytona Tortugas 3 (Single-A)\nAustin “Not Tyler” Callahan had a pair of hits and a run scored from the leadoff spot, but Daytona could not overcome the evil will that is Cardinals baseball on Wednesday. Hector Rodriguez singled, walked, and drove in a pair as an 18 year old, which is cool as heck, but the rest of the Daytona offense was pretty ho-hum on a night in which no extra-base knocks were knocked. As a whole, the Tugas saw their pitching staff walk as many Cardinals (5) as they fanned (5), which is not often a good thing.",

        "description": "There’s something about John Paul Williams, the deceased nucleus of the new Apple TV+ show Bad Sisters, played with gleeful intensity by the Danish actor Claes Bang. Bang’s typical role is a thinking person’s toxic crush; he simmers with intellectual self-satisfaction in the art-world satire The Square and indulges in casual fratricide and a spot of naked, fiery volcano-side wrestling in the recent Viking epic The Northman. But in Bad Sisters, Bang offers up a villain who’s sadistic, yes, and controlling, cruel, abusive, petty—truly a tapestry of spousal shittiness—but also disgusting. His masculinity is so pernicious that it almost festers. Watching him, you might feel small spasms of repulsion and rage, relics of muscle memory from bad men gone by.Not to mention that John Paul leaves the toilet unflushed and sniffs perpetually from a bottle of sinus spray kept in his pocket; he buttons his pajamas all the way up to the top and flashes his teeth like a shark when he hurts people. The crux of Bad Sisters, a semi-comic murder caper, is that John Paul is so awful, he has to die; there are simply no other options. The show is part of a trend that I want to call the summer of discontent: works about women forced to go rogue when systems—social services, courts, families—fail them. In the HBO documentary The Janes, activists recall organizing in 1970s Chicago to provide “safe, affordable, illegal abortions” for other women in their community rather than see one more person butchered in a back-alley job. FX’s Children of the Underground is a five-part documentary series about the charismatic, flawed activist Faye Yager, who in the 1980s ran an outfit that helped women and children flee from alleged sexual abusers. Next month, The Handmaid’s Tale returns for a fifth season on Hulu, with a hero facing the consequences of drastic action she took to bring her abuser to “justice.”[Read: What a story of 1970s abortion activism can teach us today]Against a backdrop of ambient powerlessness and seemingly invisible rage, these works carry more weight than they should have to. In July, the writer Lux Alptraum published an op-ed in The New York Times titled “Women, the Game Is Rigged. It’s Time We Stop Playing by the Rules.” Alptraum makes the case for “a feminism of disempowerment” that rejects the legitimacy of existing systems in favor of unconventional, unsanctioned, and even illegal alternatives. Clearly, this isn’t to say that murder is the answer. But Bad Sisters, you could argue, suits a certain prevailing mood: John Paul is written to trigger every viewer who’s ever felt trapped under the sole of someone else’s size-10 boot. The show takes an age-old premise—man turns torturing woman into sport—and inverts it. We find out in the first episode that John Paul will die, but not how, and over 10 episodes, Bad Sisters circles his eventual end like water in a drain. The satisfaction of watching comes from knowing that he’s in our sights. Reprisal is rarely so reliable in life.You can imagine Bad Sisters being pitched as an Irish Big Little Lies: The houses are oversize and seaside, and the atmosphere roils with the turbulence of open water and domestic strife. Sharon Horgan—the producer and writer behind Catastrophe, Divorce, Motherland, and other tales of midlife disaffection—adapted the series from a soapy Belgian drama called Clan, keeping both its central premise and its maudlin humor. In the show’s first scene, Grace Williams (played by Anne-Marie Duff) stands weeping over the open casket of John Paul, her late husband. She tenderly strokes his face, then, as her eyes move downward, starts when she notices distinct tumescence in his pajama pants. “The dead prick,” her sister Bibi (Sarah Greene) says later. “Postmortem priapism isn’t uncommon after a violent death,” Ursula (Eva Birthistle), a nurse, pipes up. Eva (Horgan) adds nothing, but viewers have already witnessed her palpable satisfaction at seeing the body of her late brother-in-law, who, it turns out, tortured all her sisters in one way or another.In flashbacks that follow, a fuller portrait of John Paul emerges: less a man than a monster patched together from spite and malevolence, with a hefty dash of cringe. At a family dinner for the holidays, he casually calls Eva a spinster; he warns his daughter to watch what she eats lest she “end up the size of your cousin”; he shouts at his sweet nephew; he refers to his wife repeatedly as “Mammy.” With Grace, in private, his behavior is overtly controlling. In one scene, he pours her a drink, then tells her she’s had too much to drive to a prearranged swim with her sisters. He slams a door Grace is holding on to, hurting her arm, then berates her for making a scene. “We’re losing her,” Eva tells her sisters later about Grace. “She’s getting quieter and smaller.” Their unfettered exuberance as they float in the open water stands in sharp contrast to Grace’s confinement.The setup of Bad Sisters is deliberately absurd, a throwback to sillier shows such as Desperate Housewives and Why Women Kill. The ease with which the Garvey sisters decide to kill John Paul, and their resoluteness when their attempts repeatedly and catastrophically fail, are pure fantasy. Barely do they try reasoning with Grace, who suffers and senses more than even her siblings see. The point isn’t to weigh the show’s ethical considerations or the practical concerns of committing homicide; it’s to feel, fleetingly, as trapped as Grace, as furious as Bibi, as manipulated as Ursula, as murderous as Eva, and to understand that there are no good, rational, pragmatic ways out. “Surely we just explain what he did,” Ursula says toward the end of the series. “Yeah, let’s try that,” Eva replies. “’Cause that always works for women.”[Read: The redemption of the bad mother]Her skepticism is fair, as Children of the Underground might attest. The documentary series, directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite (Blackfish) and Ted Gesing, is rooted in the late ’80s and ’90s, when daytime talk shows ruled the airwaves, patriarchy ruled the justice system, and American culture still hadn’t fully accepted the existence, let alone the regularity, of child abuse. With shocking frequency, the series reveals, women who fought to prove that their partners were molesting their children were forced by judges in family court to cede custody to those same alleged abusers. (Judges often viewed the mothers making accusations as paranoid and hysterical, and the fathers as composed, upright pillars of their community.) Many women turned for help to Faye Yager, a housewife in Atlanta who’d established an underground network to assist mothers fleeing with their children.The series, much like Bad Sisters, suffers somewhat from sprawl—both works could be twice as concise without losing much, and both are padded with ancillary activity that slows momentum. But Children of the Underground also benefits from its timing. When the system feels rigged, the show asks, what ends are justified in protecting the people you love? It’s not hard to draw a line from the prosecutors jailing women for having miscarriages to the judges in Yager’s day who ignored medical records and sent kids back to the same parents who’d given them an STD. In both cases, what’s mandated and what’s just seem utterly at odds.Still, there’s usually fallout for taking the law into one’s own hands. On Bad Sisters, the characters’ violent attempts at revenge have grim consequences. The desire for vengeance, The Handmaid’s Tale has long suggested, is as corrosive as the desire for power. Children of the Underground demonstrates how Yager became so in thrall to her own legend that she overreached, losing herself in conspiratorial fantasies of ritualistic abuse and getting sued by one father who even Yager acknowledged hadn’t abused his children. When I watched The Janes earlier this summer, what was most striking in retrospect was the kind of ethical symbiosis between the illicit abortion network it describes and the police who—mostly—turned a blind eye. Yes, abortion was illegal, both sides acknowledged, but it was also necessary, whether people wanted to admit it publicly or not. Roe v. Wade was momentous for many reasons; as it happens, it also insulated the women of the Jane Collective from legal consequences. They were extraordinarily lucky.These shows contain warnings, but more than that, they offer the transportive fantasy of opting out of systems that have such manifold shortcomings. There’s something comforting, right now, about the idea of an abstract sisterhood of grievance. And if this spate of works does nothing else, it captures a feeling that can’t be denied. “If the legal route is not protecting your child,” a mother says in Children of the Underground, “then as a parent, you’d better do the next best thing and … get that child to safety.” Possibly something illegal, something terrifying and consequential. But also: the next best thing. The only option that isn’t giving up altogether.",

        "description": "Photo by Ed Zurga/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Royals hitters are finally drawing walks It has been twenty years since Michael Lewis’ Moneyball came out, and over four decades since Bill James began writing that the most important thing for a hitter to do was not make outs. The recognition of on-base percentage as a more important metric than batting average has gone from the fringes to mainstream thinking in baseball. Yet the Royals, through both ignorance and lack of resources, have not fielded teams that have been able to get on base on a regular basis. In the last thirty years, the Royals have finished in the top half of the league in on-base percentage just three times (2003, 2011, 2015). And even when they have gotten on base, it was fueled more by batting average than walks - in 2015 they seventh in on-base percentage despite being dead last in walks, thanks to a high contact approach that produced the second-base batting average. \nBut batting average can be flukey, and a high contact approach is harder than ever in a day where every pitcher throws at least mid-90s with ridiculous movement. The ability to draw walks has been shown to be a more consistent skill than hitting for a high average, and yet the Royals have not finished in the top half of the league in walks drawn since 1989, while finishing among the three bottom teams in the league 22 times since then. \nHowever, the Royals finally seem to be embracing the position that they need patient hitters that can get on base. This seemed evident in their acquisitions of patient hitters like Andrew Benintendi and Carlos Santana, but it has been most obvious in the development of their young hitters. While it is still early in their careers, the young rookies the Royals have called up are showing walk rates rarely seen in the Royals organization.\n\nThe Royals have three rookies with significant playing time with a walk rate north of ten percent - MJ Melendez, Vinnie Pasquantino, and Nick Pratto. To give you an example of how rare that is, since Dayton Moore’s first full season in 2007, the Royals have just nine seasons of ANY qualified hitter with a ten percent walk rate in a season.\nWe will see if Drew Waters can continue his high walk rate after not putting up those kind of numbers in the Braves organization, but he has credited the Royals with helping him simplifying his approach.\n“There were a couple of things I was doing mechanically, but honestly, the big thing that I feel like has really changed for me is they’re big on hunting your zone and looking for pitches you can do damage with,” \nThis approach has been emphasized throughout the organization. Alec Lewis of The Athletic wrote about the philosophy of minor league hitting coaches Drew Saylor, Mike Tosar, and Keoni DeRenne earlier this year.  \nThey also streamlined hitting processes throughout the minor leagues, from game-planning adjustments to pregame practice strategies. All of it emerged from three simple mantras provided by the coaches: (1.) Know thyself (as a hitter), (2.) swing at the pitches you can hit hard and take the ones you can’t and (3.) be elite in your preparation.\nThat’s a far cry from the approach of “put the ball in play and make something happen” that was emphasized a decade ago. And this change has come from the top. When hitting coach Terry Bradshaw was dismissed, Dayton Moore talked about what he wanted to see from his lineup.\n“We need to see nine players in our lineup that are committed to get on base any way possible. That means we cannot chase pitches out of the strike zone. When we do have pitches to hit in the strike zone, we can’t miss them. We’ve got to square them up. We’ve got to drive balls where they’re pitched.”\nThe effect has not been uniform. Bobby Witt Jr.’s walk rate is the fifth-worst by any qualified hitter in baseball and he has one of the higher chase rates in baseball. But the emergence of several other young players with the ability to draw walks has to be an encouraging sign for the Royals.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe increased popularity and proliferation of ultra-processed foods in the United States has raised concerns among health professionals, as these foods are linked with a host of poor health outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, new research shows that for U.S. men, eating more of these foods is associated with a nearly 30 percent increased risk of colorectal cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed cancer in the United States. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. men who consume higher rates of ultra-processed food are at a 29 percent greater risk of developing colorectal cancer, according to new study results published in The BMJ. However, no association was seen among women in the study. \n\n\n\nColorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed cancer in the country and the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFurthermore “ultra-processed foods (that is, industrial ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat formulations made of little or no whole foods) now contribute 57 percent of total daily calories consumed by American adults, which has been continuously increasing in the past two decades,” authors wrote.\n\n\n\nIn recent years, the consumption of ultra-processed foods has been linked with a host of poor health outcomes including coronary heart diseases, obesity, hypertension and metabolic syndrome, to name a few.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo better understand any association between ultra-processed food intake and colorectal cancer, researchers assessed data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, the Nurses’ Health Study, and the Nurses’ Health Study II. As part of the studies, participants filled out food frequency questionnaires every four years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA total of 46,341 men and 159,907 women were included in the analyses. Between 24 and 28 years of follow-up 1,294 cases of colorectal cancer among men were recorded, and 1,922 among women. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared with men who ate the lowest proportion of ultra-processed food, those in the highest-consumption group had a significantly heightened risk of the cancer that remained after adjusting for body mass index.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmong the at-risk men, risk was particularly high for distal colon cancer.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Processed meats, most of which fall into the category of ultra-processed foods, are a strong risk factor for colorectal cancer,” explained lead study author Lu Wang of Tufts University in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Ultra-processed foods are also high in added sugars and low in fiber, which contribute to weight gain and obesity, and obesity is an established risk factor for colorectal cancer.”\n\n\n\nWhen divided into subgroups, researchers found increased consumption of meat, poultry, and seafood based ready-to-eat products and sugar sweetened beverages (i.e. soda and fruit-based beverages) posed the highest risk among men.\n\n\n\nHowever, an inverse association was discovered between ultra-processed dairy foods like yogurt and colorectal cancer risk in women, authors noted. “Foods like yogurt can potentially counteract the harmful impacts of other types of ultra-processed foods in women,” said co-author Fang Fang Zhang, also of Tufts University.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore research is needed to better understand the sex differeneces seen with regard to colorectal cancer risk and intake of processed foods and to determine whether the lack of association among women was due to chance or other confounding factors.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAuthors point to food additives as a potential root cause for the association documented, as these can alter gut microbiota and promote inflammation. Contaminants from food processing or packaging may also account for the link.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Chemically processing foods can aid in extending shelf life, but many processed foods are less healthy than unprocessed alternatives,” Zhang added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBecause the foods are often cheap and readily available “we need to make consumers aware of the risks associated with consuming unhealthy foods in quantity and make the healthier options easier to choose instead.”",

        "description": "An immense amount of ink has been spilled recently about the American Innovation and Choice Online Act (AICOA) from both sides of the aisle. Aimed at eliminating the alleged competitive edge that comes with “self-preferencing,” it would apply only to the&nbsp;largest online platform companies&nbsp;in the economy. This would mean that companies such as Google and Amazon could not feature their own in-house products over those of a competitor.\n\n\n\nIt’s&nbsp;not clear&nbsp;that self-preferencing harms consumers, but that’s not really the point. Some claim that Congress is&nbsp;acting too quickly, while others insist it is already&nbsp;late to the game. Some claim that this proposal, along with the Open Markets Act (OMA), will destroy the internet as we know it, while others say that the only way to save the internet is with these proposals. Arguments cross party lines, with notable&nbsp;Democrats&nbsp;voicing dissent and high-profile&nbsp;Republicans&nbsp;listed as co-sponsors on the bill. Similar talking points have been offered about the bill’s impact on the economy, jobs and small businesses.\n\n\n\nBut regardless of where the arguments come from, there is a sense of urgency that something must be done. What if there is another way?\n\n\n\nThe European Union (EU) recently finalized language for the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a strikingly similar proposal to those currently under consideration in Congress. The DMA is slated to go into effect by the end of the year, with companies required to fully comply by the&nbsp;end of 2024. Unless Congress passes something before the midterm elections, the DMA will begin to impact markets, including in the United States, much sooner.\n\n\n\nThe best option right now is to wait for those markets to react to the changes in Europe and make the most informed choice possible, rather than forcing tech companies and consumers to cope with all the regulations all at once. The&nbsp;European Parliament&nbsp;claims that the DMA will ensure fair competition and foster more innovation and more choice for consumers online. These lofty goals are laudable but may be overstated. The most recent rollout of omnibus legislation appears to be falling tremendously short.\n\n\n\nThe EU’s&nbsp;General Data Protection Regulation&nbsp;(GDPR) came into force in 2018, and at the time was heralded as the&nbsp;gold standard&nbsp;of data protection. The regulation purported to give consumers more control over their data and cut down on the data-hoarding practices of the largest technology companies. The&nbsp;European Commission&nbsp;claimed that the GDPR would decrease compliance costs and make the EU a more attractive place for business, leading to an erosion of Big Tech’s online dominance. The reality, however, is the opposite.\n\n\n\nBy all available accounts, the GDPR has been a&nbsp;resounding failure. Not only has the regulation increased the cost of compliance for all companies, but there are widespread claims that competition has declined. By imposing serious restrictions on the way data is shared and processed, companies that have already acquired large databases of consumer data have a massive leg up. Smaller companies are kneecapped, able neither to purchase nor to collect enough data to compete against the largest tech companies.\n\n\n\nTo some degree, then, the DMA may be designed to fix a problem that was self-made. The GDPR has played a rather significant role in cementing the dominance of big technology platforms within the European Union. While we cannot be certain of the competitive landscape without it, the early consensus is that potential upstart companies would be less burdened, spend less on compliance and be able to better to compete with Big Tech rivals. The United States, thankfully, does not yet face this self-imposed competition problem.\n\n\n\nThe debate happening today is, to some extent, unnecessary. First, we can learn from the EU’s past mistakes. Second, we can wait and see if the DMA radically improves competition in Europe and leads to widespread prosperity and markedly better outcomes for consumers, or if it goes the way of the GDPR by making the internet a much more difficult place to operate and suppressing small business competition online.\n\n\n\nIf Congress eventually chooses Europe’s path, data and findings from the DMA’s rollout can inform its effort. Applying a “now or never” approach to policy is not always wise.\n\n\n\nAlden Abbott&nbsp;is a senior research fellow with the&nbsp;Mercatus&nbsp;Center at George Mason University and a former general counsel with the Federal Trade Commission.&nbsp;Andrew&nbsp;Mercado&nbsp;is an adjunct professor with the Antonin Scalia Law School.",

        "description": "Fifty-nine percent of Democrats in Massachusetts say President Biden should not seek another term, according to a University of Massachusetts Center for Public Opinion poll published Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe poll, published ahead of the state's primary elections on Tuesday, shows 77 percent of Democratic voters in Massachusetts approve of Biden, yet they favor other candidates for their 2024 nominee.\n\n\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg had the highest support for the next presidential election, at 53 percent, while 51 percent said Vice President Harris should run. Both Harris and Buttigieg previously ran in 2020 against Biden.\n\n\n\nOther high-profile Democrats scoring high marks of approval for a White House run include Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass,) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), at about 40 percent.\n\n\n\nJohn Cluverius, director of survey research for the Center for Public Opinion, said Democrats in Massachusetts are \"ready for Biden to pass the torch.\"\n\n\n\n\"Any political scientist will tell you that the best strategy for any party in power to win re-election is for its incumbent President to run again,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe news comes as Biden's approval rating hit 40 percent in August after the president notched a series of victories, including passing the historic climate, tax and health care bill the Inflation Reduction Act and announcing a plan to cancel up to $20,000 in student debt for some borrowers.\n\n\n\nThat's up from 31 percent in the same poll in July, when the president was struggling with high inflation, soaring gas prices and stalled agendas in Congress.\n\n\n\nThe Center for Public Opinion poll was conducted Aug. 15-26 among 800 Massachusetts Democrats. The margin of error is 3.9 percentage points.",

There, borrowers will be able to view a breakdown of their federal loan and grant information as well as track and manage their federal loans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Some borrowers, depending on when they were enrolled, may have to first create an FSA [Federal Student Aid] ID to log into that student aid account,” said Rachel Gentry, director of government relations at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. “Some borrowers already have that ID from when they were students.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGentry stressed that borrowers should ensure now “that their contact information is all up to date” with both their loan&nbsp;servicers and the Education Department in their StudentAid.gov account.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe agency has said about 8 million borrowers could be eligible for automatic relief if their “relevant income data is already available” to the office. But borrowers will also be able to apply for forgiveness by early October if the agency doesn’t have that income data.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBorrowers who continued to make payments during the pandemic could also be eligible for a partial refund.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore details are expected to come out about the plan in the weeks ahead, but borrowers can also sign up for updates on the department’s main website.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFind out which loans you have\n\n\n\nPresident Biden’s forgiveness plan likely won't&nbsp;relieve private loan debt, experts say, though there are questions about whether&nbsp;borrowers&nbsp;with certain loans&nbsp;issued by&nbsp;private lenders&nbsp;will be able to see relief.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn particular, experts are awaiting more information on how the department will handle Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFFELP loans “were issued by private and state lenders, but they were guaranteed by the federal government,” Gentry explained. “So what that means is that if one of those borrowers were to default on their loan, the government would pay those private and nonfederal entities who are the lenders a substitute to kind of make up for their losses.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“When&nbsp;we transitioned to 100 percent direct lending a little over a decade ago, some of those [FFELP] lenders’ portfolios were purchased by the federal government ... so those loans that were purchased at that time basically became like federal loans,” she continued.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, Gentry said some of the&nbsp;commercially held&nbsp;FFELP loans are still owned by private and state lenders.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"We're still waiting for more information on what folks with&nbsp;commercially held&nbsp;[FFELP] loans&nbsp;are going to need to do to access the forgiveness, whether they there will be a way for them to not have to take action to receive forgiveness or whether they'll have to consolidate,\" she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCheck your income eligibility&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEligibility for the relief extends to borrowers with incomes of less than $125,000 for individuals and $250,000 for married couples and heads of households.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExperts say the amount will be based on income earned in 2020 and 2021, so borrowers may need to have that information available.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Borrowers should make sure that they have access to those tax returns so that they have a sense of what their reported income is in those years,” Katharine Meyer, a fellow for the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institution, said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“My read of the policy is going to be based on the lower of those two, so they should be familiar with which of their household incomes was lower in those two years,” she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeyer also said borrowers shouldn’t be too concerned about a tax implication of this forgiveness program, noting “an exemption on taxing forgiven debts right now that runs through the end of 2025.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, there have been questions raised about borrowers who could have to pay some state taxes on the relief depending on&nbsp;where they reside.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGet acquainted with other programs&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany borrowers can participate in a federal income-driven repayment plan and could be eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF).\n\n\n\nThe Education Department currently lists&nbsp;four income-driven repayment plans online that have varying durations and pay thresholds depending on factors such as level of higher education attained and income.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnder the current PSLF program, borrowers with government jobs or who work at nonprofit organizations could be eligible for forgiveness after 120 qualifying monthly payments, or a decade of consistent repayment.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExperts have urged borrowers to move quickly on applying for that program ahead of an October deadline.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“One potential area for confusion that borrowers are going to face in the coming months is the dual deadlines of submitting for potential forgiveness, and the process to apply for the temporary public service loan forgiveness program waiver,” Meyer said. “That program has a deadline at the end of Oct. 31.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat deadline matters, Meyers said, because of the Education Department’s temporary loosening of eligibility requirements&nbsp;for the PSLF program that is set to lapse.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“These are things like counting prior payments that were not made under an income-driven repayment plan toward forgiveness,” she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Many individuals may need to consolidate their loans in order to be eligible for that program,” she added. “That consolidation shouldn't affect the eligibility of those loans to then get forgiven whenever that process gets rolled out. But I could see how a lot of borrowers will be confused about that.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrep that budget&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBorrowers will have until the end of next year to apply for the broader forgiveness program announced last week. But they are advised to apply by Nov. 15 if they want to see the relief take effect before the end of the year —&nbsp;which is when the current pandemic freeze on repayment will expire.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe moratorium, which also applies to interest accrual, was extended last week through Dec. 31, marking the seventh such time the pause has been renewed since it was first enacted in March 2020.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, the Biden administration has made clear it won’t be shooting for an eighth extension, which means many borrowers will likely have to prepare to make regular payments for the first time in years.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA report released by the&nbsp;Education Data Initiative&nbsp;earlier this year placed the average monthly student loan payment at around $460. But borrowers can pay more or less depending on their payment plan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor example, the Education Department notes on its website that some borrowers could qualify for zero-dollar payments if they make under a certain amount.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n”If you are experiencing financial difficulty and you expect to be experiencing financial difficulty, you can explore your options with a loan servicer,” student loan expert Mark Kantrowitz said. “Don't wait until Dec. 31 to call the loan servicer.”&nbsp;",

After conducting a search, Trump’s lawyers turned over several more documents in June.\n\n\n\nAfter interviewing members of Trump’s staff, the FBI obtained the search warrant for Mar-a-Lago in August. In total, the government has recovered more than 300 classified documents from Trump, according to The New York Times.\n\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal poll, which was conducted by Impact Research and Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates, interviewed 1,313 registered voters Aug. 17-25.

They help protect the integrity of the conversation and create a publicly accessible record of what was said,” the blog post states.\n\n\n\n“We’re hoping that, with the availability of Edit Tweet, Tweeting will feel more approachable and less stressful.”\n\n\n\nTwitter's communication team said in April that the much-anticipated edit feature has been in the works since last year.\n\n\n\nThe feature is being tested internally and will soon be available to users with Twitter Blue, a paid subscription that gives access to some premium features on the platform.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/3623869-how-bidens-debt-forgiveness-plan-could-transform-income-driven-repayment/",
        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin President Biden’s historic student debt forgiveness announcement was a critical addition to income-driven repayment (IDR) plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden proposed a new IDR plan that would let the federal government cover a borrower’s unpaid monthly interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Education Department would also be allowed to forgive loans once they hit 10 years for those with undergraduate federal loans that had original balances of $12,000 or less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent loan borrowers now and in the future could have access to a new income-driven repayment plan that would help limit balances from ballooning over time, thanks to a proposed rule&nbsp;within President Biden’s historic student debt forgiveness announcement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s proposed plan starts with limiting monthly payments to 5 percent of a borrower’s discretionary income, forgiving outstanding loan balances after 10 years for borrowers whose initial balances were less than $12,000, and having the federal government cover unpaid monthly interest.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAbout one in every three borrowers with government-issued student loans are already enrolled in some form of income-driven repayment (IDR). The plans, of which there are four, are meant to&nbsp;financially protect borrowers and make loan debt more manageable with monthly payments based on a certain percentage of income.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We’re delivering targeted relief that will help ensure borrowers are not placed in a worse position financially because of the pandemic, and restore trust in a system that should be creating opportunity, not a debt trap,” said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, in a statement in August.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCreating more affordable loan payments, IDR plans have become critical for millions of borrowers. The change, which is currently under draft rule and&nbsp;available for public comment for 30 days before moving forward, aims to offer even more financial relief. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe new IDR plan would:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCut monthly payments in half&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo date, most IDR plans require payments of 10 percent of a borrower’s discretionary income. Any&nbsp;remaining loan balances are forgiven after&nbsp;20 years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThough IDR was designed to make student loan repayments affordable, in many cases the opposite happens.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn analysis by the Brookings Institution noted that the formula for setting IDR monthly payments only reflects income and family size, not regional differences in the cost of living or other expenses borrowers may have.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis formula has resulted in many borrowers not making large enough monthly payments to cover the cost of their loans’ principal balance plus accrued interest, leading to balances growing to insurmountable levels over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe new proposed IDR plan aims to tackle the formula that determines a borrower’s monthly payment by raising the amount considered to be one’s discretionary income and protecting it from repayment.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat's achieved by lowering monthly payments to just 5 percent of borrowers with undergraduate loans’ discretionary income—currently IDR plans set monthly payments at 10 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House also says it will guarantee that no borrower earning under 225 percent of the federal poverty line—which is equivalent to a $15 minimum wage salary for a single borrower—will have to make a monthly payment towards their undergraduate student loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRein in compounding interest&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInterest has played an outsized role in the student debt crisis and under current IDR plans, millions of borrowers see their loan balances balloon. That's because interest will continue to accrue and add to any outstanding loan balance even if someone makes their monthly payment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden hopes to change that by having the federal government cover a borrower’s unpaid monthly interest so no loan balance will grow so long as monthly payments are being made.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStudent debt expert Mark Kantrowitz told Changing America that this approach doesn’t completely cancel interest, it simply forgives remaining interest balances after a borrower's payment is applied—resulting in no interest capitalization on loans for borrowers enrolled in the new IDR plan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The interest benefit is more of a psychological benefit than real savings for borrowers who experience economic distress, since the interest would have been forgiven eventually anyway,” Kantrowitz said. “But it prevents the student loan balance from increasing, which is a source of student loan stress.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSpeed up loan forgiveness&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnder the new plan, the Education Department could also forgive eligible loans once they hit 10 years, but only for those with undergraduate federal loans with original balances of $12,000 or less. Currently, IDR plans offer forgiveness at the 20-year mark.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThough it would cut in half the amount of time and money owed to forgive a loan, this aspect of the plan would likely only affect a limited number of people. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nKevin Miller, associate director of higher education at the Bipartisan Policy Center, explained that most borrowers have balances around $30,000, which would exclude most bachelor’s degree recipients from eligibility for loan forgiveness after 10 years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I suspect that part of the motivation here was to try and provide a shorter timeline for forgiveness for people who dropped out of college with a limited amount of debt,” Miller said to Changing America.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMiller also noted that since the federal loan system does not automatically enroll borrowers in repayments plan they may be eligible for, “there’s a lot of borrowers who probably won’t engage with this new plan.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat critics are saying&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome critics point out that Biden’s IDR proposal does little to address the problem of soaring tuition costs and would enable student borrowers to attend schools they can’t afford. It could even&nbsp;incentivize universities to raise tuition, as some borrowers may have the option to cap&nbsp;their monthly payments after graduation&nbsp;at 5 percent over a 10 or 20-year period. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nMiller also voiced concern that the proposed plan could lead&nbsp;colleges and universities to recommend students take out more loans. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“While IDR plans are great for preventing defaults, they aren’t necessarily great for people actually being able to repay their debt,” Miller said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe average cost to attend college in 2022, including books, supplies and living expenses,&nbsp;is more than $35,500 per year. Data shows that the cost of attendance has doubled in the 21st century, growing by 6.8 percent annually.&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/whatsapp-wear-os-3-calls",
        "description": "While there is currently no WhatsApp app for Wear OS, watch wearers have been able to accept WhatsApp voice calls indirectly with an &#8220;Answer call on phone&#8221; option, which would promptly let you continue the conversation on your handset. However, the newest update to the Beta version of WhatsApp on the Play Store now allows you to fully answer and continue the call from your wrist without having to hand it off to your phone.\n\n\n\nThis new feature was spotted by u/jotta_morales_b on Reddit and then reported on by 9to5Google, who provided a screenshot showing a Wear OS watch screen with an incoming Whatsapp voice call, made obvious by the app&#8217;s logo and name shown directly below the phone number. This new capability came about after updating the Android app to version 2.22.19.12; however, some have also reported the same results on version 2.22.19.11. The only differentiating factor seems to be which version of the Samsung Galaxy Watch the user owns &#x2014; Galaxy Watch 4 or 5 &#x2014; since those two are the most popular smartwatches that currently run Wear OS 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, as the screenshot above shows how the incoming call appears when the watch is paired with a Samsung phone, those who have a watch paired with a Pixel 6 phone are also benefiting from this update. According to 9to5, for Pixel 6 owners, the incoming call appears as a native call on the watch without any WhatsApp branding, which made this feature hard to spot. It should be noted that this feature doesn&#8217;t add the ability to initiate WhatsApp voice calls from your smartwatch, only to answer incoming ones.\n\n\n\nAlthough this is, for now, a one-way solution, it&#8217;s encouraging to see new app developments taking place for Wear OS 3. Just recently, the Google Keep app gained a tile with a new update, so this isn&#8217;t a one-off incident. Subsequently, it makes me feel like Wear OS is being taken seriously, unlike the stagnant state it was in before. Perhaps the fact that Wear OS has matured and runs better than ever on newer hardware has something to do with it, or maybe &#x2014; and go with me on this one &#x2014; the announcement of the Pixel Watch has proven to app developers that this isn&#8217;t an experiment anymore and Wear OS now means business. \n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Cubs win one north of the border, 7-5 As I’ve alluded to for two straight nights, the value of this trip north was the learning experience of playing meaningful games this time of the year. For the last two weeks, the Cubs have been playing teams that are fighting for their invitation to the playoffs. It’s not over yet, with the road trip moving to St. Louis next after a day off. \nOn Wednesday night, the Cubs finally broke through and won one in Toronto. To their credit, they led in all three games, but in this one, they closed the deal. This one was a nice team win. A number of guys contributed and this is one time that my selecting three positive performances from the game isn’t an easy one. Spoiler alert, one of the guys I thought of actually ended up on one of the goat podiums. \nLuke Farrell started what was basically a bullpen game for the Cubs. He was the first of seven pitchers, none of whom threw more than two innings or faced more than eight Blue Jays hitters. Eight of the nine Cubs batters in this game had a hit, two had two and one had a hit and a walk. Five different players drove in a run, six different players scored a run, there were six extra base hits amongst the 10 hits. So there were a lot of guys who positively contributed to this win. \nYou love to see it when so many people get involved in a win like this. Stars are indispensable, but it’s pretty arguable that depth is what carries the day in the regular season. As I’ve noted in the past, this roster is likely the depth portion of a playoff caliber team. That’s not meant to be insulting, just a reality that elite talent is going to have to be added to the core of this team if it is going to be a championship caliber team. \nThe good news comes in two fronts. 1) Most of the salary is rolling off for this team. 2) If you’ve been following Josh Timmers day in and day out, then you know that Brennen Davis and Pete Crow-Armstrong, among so many others, are on the horizon and look likely to be some of that elite infusion of talent. \nLet’s see who I settled on for my three positive performances of the game. \n\nManuel Rodriguez threw two innings, faced six batters and he retired them all. He was awarded the win for his efforts. He struck out one. \nZach McKinstry. Surely, I’m not the only one who was frustrated when this game’s lineup was released. I realize that you have to get Zach into a number of games and really get an idea of what you’ve got. But he’s pretty clearly been one of the least productive bats on the roster. So playing? Fine. Leading off? What the heck? He responded with a pair of hits, one of which was a triple. He drove in a run. \nIan Happ had a pair of hits, one of them a double. He drove in a run and scored a run. \n\nAnd now, we turn our attention to the Heroes and Goats from Wednesday’s win. \nGame 131, August 31: Cubs 7 at Blue Jays 5 (56-75)\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs\n  \nReminder: Heroes and Goats are determined by WPA scores and are in no way subjective.\nTHREE HEROES:\n\n\nSuperhero: Zach McKinstry (.157). 2-4, 3B, RBI, 2K\n\nHero: Manuel Rodriguez (.121). 2IP (6 batters), K\n\nSidekick: Ian Happ (.107). 2-4, 2B, RBI, R, 2K\n\nTHREE GOATS:\n\n\nBilly Goat: Erich Uelmen (-.270). ⅔ IP (6 batters), 3H, 3R\n\nGoat: Christopher Morel (-.089). 0-4, 2K\n\nKid: Franmil Reyes (-.051). 1-4, HR, RBI, 2R, K\n\nWPA Play of the Game: The Cubs were leading 6-2 in the sixth and runners were on first and second with one out. Erich Uelmen was pitching to Alejandro Kirk and served up a three-run homer to cut the lead to one. (.220)\n*Cubs Play of the Game: It was just 2-0 Cubs when Nico Hoerner batted with runners on second and third and two outs in the third. Hoerner doubled and two runs scored. (.134)\n\nRizzo Award Cumulative Standings: (Top 5/Bottom 5)\nThe award is named for Anthony Rizzo, who finished first in this category three of the first four years it was in existence and four times overall. He also recorded the highest season total ever at +65.5. The point scale is three points for a Superhero down to negative three points for a Billy Goat.\n\nDavid Robertson +22.5\nNico Hoerner +19.5\nScott Effross +17\nChristopher Morel +15\nPatrick Wisdom +13.5\nDaniel Norris/Frank Schwindel/Rowan Wick -9.5\nYan Gomes -15\nJason Heyward -15.5\nRafael Ortega -16.5\n\nUp Next: The Cubs have an off day Thursday, their first in almost three weeks and then they’ll play in St. Louis over the weekend. The Cardinals went to 13 innings Wednesday to beat the Reds. They too are off Thursday and should have a chance to reset. The win was their second straight and moved them to 22 games over .500 and 6½ games clear of the Brewers in the NL Central. Barring a disaster, they are heading to their record-increasing 12th NL Central title. \nThe Cubs have won just six of 16 games vs. the Cardinals this year and so St. Louis has already clinched the season series. The last time the Cubs were in St. Louis, just about a month ago, they were swept in a three-game series. Adrian Sampson (1-4, 3.97) will start for the Cubs. Jordan Montgomery (7-3, 3.28) will start for the Cardinals. You might recall that Montgomery threw a one-hit shutout against the Cubs in Chicago during the last homestand. His career numbers against the Cubs are disgusting (3-0, three starts, 0.79 ERA, 22⅔ innings, nine hits, four walks, 15 strikeouts). Of teams that he’s thrown at least 20 innings against, his next lowest ERA is 2.22 (against the White Sox, who he is 2-0 against in four starts).",

        "description": "I&#8217;ll be submitting this guide to Reclaim Hosting&#8217;s support documentation to illustrate how to move files between environments using the Reclaim Cloud GUI. I discovered this trick while migrating a Ghost instance in Reclaim Cloud from one environment to another as discussed in this post.\nI am borrowing liberally from elastx&#8217;s documentation of this process given they do an excellent job of breaking it down. Moving files between environments uses the somewhat confusing terminology Export, and you can find this option if you click on the configuration wrench of the node within the environment you want to move. Below is a video tutorial documenting the process followed by step-by-step directions.\n\nExport directory\n\nFind the configuration wrench on the Application Servers source node.\n\nConfig of Node from which files will be exported\n\nGo to the folder you want to Export files from. In this case /var/lib/ghost/content/. Click the cogwheel of the content folder as shown on the image below and choose Export\n\nExport Directory Contents\n\nMake sure to choose the correct target container where your target Application Server is at.\n\nSelect proper target environment in Reclaim Cloud to export content\n\nHere we use the path /var/lib/ghost/content-source which will create and mount this folder on the source environments Application Server.\n\n\nCopy files\n\nClick the configuration wrench on the target environment’s Application Server.\n\nConfig wrench\n\nTo the left, click the cogwheel and click Copy Path, which will copy the full path location to your clipboard.\n\n\n\nClick on the terminal icon to engage the Web SSH terminal\n\n\n\nIn the terminal you should write cd then paste previously copied path /var/lib/ghost/content-source and then enter. After that you should see the folder content-source executing ls -l as shown on the image below.\n\n\n\nNow you should be able to copy files anywhere within the new environment node. Using the --verbose flags gives you this output.\n\nUse the cp &#8211;verbose to copy files between source and destination folders\n\nYou can confirm that the files been copied by browsing to that folder in the GUI.\n\nZip files copied cleanly between folders\nClean up\n\nUnmount the exported directory on the target application server as shown below.\n\nUnmount networked directory from target environment",

        "description": "Free-agent righty Carlos Martinez has been suspended 85 games under Major League Baseball&#8217;s joint domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy, commissioner Rob Manfred announced Thursday via press release. The suspension is retroactive to June 19 and comes on top of an 80-game PED suspension he received back in May after testing positive for Ibutamoren.\nMartinez, who&#8217;ll turn 31 later this month, spent time with the Giants and Red Sox organizations early in the 2022 season but never pitched for either club in the Majors. He spent the 2013-21 seasons with the Cardinals and, from 2015-18, was one of the better young starting pitchers in the National League (3.22 ERA in 698 2/3 innings).\nMartinez made a pair of All-Star teams during his time with St. Louis and signed a five-year, $51MM contract extension in Feb. 2017. Injuries derailed the majority of that contract, however, as the right-hander was limited to just 150 2/3 innings over the contract&#8217;s final three seasons.",

        "description": "The soul music visionary died in 1976 at the peak of his career. But his legacy endures – thanks to sampling, fans such as Elton John and Chaka Khan, and the efforts of his three daughtersIn the mid-60s, a struggling vibraphone player named Charles Stepney and his wife, Rubie, visited their pastor looking for career advice. Stepney’s work as a jazz musician in Chicago was intermittent at best: when he did get work, Rubie was unhappy about spending nights at home alone. “So the pastor prayed,” says Stepney’s daughter Charlene. “He said, ‘Dear God, please give him a job where he can be at home with his family at night but still be able to do his music.’ Mom and Dad laughed all the way home. They were like: ‘Hmm, we could have said that prayer for ourselves!’”Salvation, nevertheless, came shortly afterwards in the form of a job with Chess Records, the renowned Chicago label that had introduced the world to Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf and Bo Diddley. Stepney was employed to write out lead sheets for the label’s producers and arrangers, and as an arranger in his own right. He wasn’t making much headway in this department until he was in a meeting with Marshall Chess, the son of the label’s founder, who noticed that Stepney was carrying a portfolio “six or eight inches thick”. When he asked what it was, Stepney blithely informed him that it was “a symphony I’ve just written”. Continue reading...",

The device will be available in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa in September 2022 with a starting price of €549 — US pricing and availability are still to be announced.\nThe IdeaPad 5i is Lenovo’s first 16-inch Chromebook, and it’s a substantial one at 4.10 pounds and 0.8 inches thick. The display has a 2.5K resolution, a 16:10 aspect ratio, and a maximum brightness of 350 nits — but what really has the Chromebook community buzzing is that it also has a 120Hz refresh rate. That means you can see up to 120 frames per second when you’re gaming (on GeForce Now or Stadia, for example). It should also make for a...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

There were a relatively low number of videos about election fraud, but the most skeptical YouTube users saw three times as many of them as the least skeptical users. \n“The more susceptible you are to these types of narratives about the election…the more you would be recommended content about that narrative,” says study author James Bisbee, who’s now a political scientist at Vanderbilt University. \nIn the wake of his 2020 election loss, former President Donald Trump has promoted the false claim that the election was stolen, calling for a repeat election as recently...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

And the lead-up to Pokémon Violet and Scarlet has been full of monster reveals, the most recent of which is an artist who stays up all night and is a bit of a loner.\nGrafaiai, as it’s called, was revealed today in a clever documentary-style video clip that really makes me want a David Attenborough narrated series all about pocket monsters. The toxic monkey pokémon is cute, of course, but as with many of its adorable contemporaries, things get pretty dark when you look at the details.

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAround the world, women complete a disproportionate amount of unpaid work compared with men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new review details the toll unpaid work takes on women’s mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors stress the importance of policy changes to address this problem, including implementation of universal childcare and flexible work hours for men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployed women around the world disproportionately spend hours on unpaid labor compared to men – and the under-recognized work takes a toll on their mental health.\n\n\n\nThat’s according to a new review published this month in The Lancet Public Health. The report comes as unpaid labor like caregiving and house work has increasingly fallen on women during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnalyzing more than a dozen studies of thousands of participants from around the world, researchers found that women reported poorer mental health when unpaid labor demands increased. At the same time, researchers found just three studies of men that detailed any negative association.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe review also “confirms persistent inequities in the division of unpaid work,” authors wrote, adding findings suggest these inequities “expose women to greater risk of poorer mental health than men.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlthough there is no universally recognized definition of unpaid labor, it is typically inclusive of “of all responsibilities and tasks done to maintain a household and its family members without any explicit monetary compensation,” authors explained. These could include cooking, cleaning, and caring for children and elderly.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWomen also experience economic penalties, in addition to a hit to their mental health, for taking on more unpaid labor. Regardless of where studies took place or at what time, authors noted women completed more unpaid labor than men in every investigation assessed. A total of 35 countries were reflected in the review.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Substantive policy levers, such as universal childcare and normalizing flexible working arrangements for men, are urgently required to start shifting this normative position,” they wrote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This double burden of paid and unpaid work exposes women to greater risk for overload, time poverty and poorer mental health,” explained lead study author Jennifer Ervin of the University of Melbourne in a press release. “Crucially, women are also routinely trading off paid work hours to meet their disproportionally high unpaid labor responsibilities.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe findings underscore the need for greater equity in the division of unpaid labor, she stressed, while changes that enable men to take on their equal share could help improve women’s mental health.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBecause included studies differed in how they were carried out, more longitudinal research is needed to draw more robust conclusions about the effect of unpaid labor on mental health, authors concluded.\n\n\n\nMore consistent methods of measuring and defining unpaid labor are also warranted, along with studies differentiating total unpaid labor, childcare, and housework.&nbsp;",

        "description": "American satisfaction with K-12 public schools has fallen almost 10 percent in the past three years, according to a new Gallup poll.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe poll, published on Thursday, found that 42 percent of respondents are currently satisfied with the nation’s K-12 education system, while 55 percent are dissatisfied. \n\n\n\nThat is a 9-point decrease from August 2019, when 51 percent of respondents said they were satisfied with the nation’s schooling system, which marked a peak. \n\n\n\nAmerica's classrooms have become a battleground for COVID-19 safety measures and other cultural issues in the past three years, with many GOP candidates making \"parental rights\" in education a campaign cornerstone. \n\n\n\nThe Gallup poll found Republican satisfaction with schools far lower than among Democrats: 30 percent of Republican respondents were satisfied, compared to 51 percent of Democrats.\n\n\n\nAsked about their specific concerns, 15 percent of respondents cited poor or outdated curriculum in the nation’s education system, 12 percent said the U.S. education system is outranked by other competing countries and 11 percent said schools are failing to teach basic subjects such as reading, writing and arithmetic. \n\n\n\nTen percent of respondents expressed their dissatisfaction over political agendas being taught in schools, nine percent said students are not learning life skills, and 8 percent of respondents cited the lack of funding and resources for students and teachers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwenty-six percent of respondents said they do not plan to have their children attend public K-12 schools this year, down from 28 percent from last year. \n\n\n\nThe new Gallup poll was conducted Aug. 1-23 with a total of 1,006 respondents. The poll’s margin of error is 4 percentage points.",

        "description": "Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said Thursday that the pandemic has had \"profound impacts\" on the nation's schoolchildren and called for communities to \"raise the bar for our students\" in the wake of a new report showing test scores for America's 9-year-olds fell dramatically in 2020 and 2021.\n\n\n\nIn a USA Today opinion piece, Cardona highlighted a number of steps the Education Department and schools across the nation are taking to address the challenge, but pushed states and counties to do more, saying \"we can’t take our foot off the gas.\"\n\n\n\n\"This data should serve as a further call to action for states, districts and communities to use these funds quickly, effectively and on strategies we know work,\" he wrote. \"It must take a commitment from all of us to use data responsibly — not to punish or label schools or educators, but to allow local leaders to target resources to communities and schools that need them most.\"\n\n\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics released data Thursday as a preview of an upcoming National Assessment of Educational Progress report, known as the nation’s report card.\n\n\n\nThe data showed that during the pandemic's first two years, reading scores fell 5 percentage points, to the lowest level in 30 years, and math scores fell 7 points, the first decrease in history.\n\n\n\nThe test scores reveal a stark divide between the nation's schoolchildren along racial lines. Math scores dropped 5 points for white students but 13 points for Black students.\n\n\n\nThe pandemic led to vast changes in the country's schools, including mask-wearing, social distancing guidelines and a new shift to virtual schooling during peak waves of the public health crisis. \n\n\n\nAt the same time, state and local leaders have also taken steps in some states to limit the teaching of racial issues as well as gender identity and sexuality. \n\n\n\nAmericans are largely dissatisfied with the nation's K-12 public education system. A Gallup poll released Thursday shows just 42 percent of Americans approve of the quality of the K-12 schooling, the lowest level in two decades.\n\n\n\nThe secretary said a \"substantial portion\" of students behind grade level in at least one school subject in 2021 caught up in time for summer break this year. \n\n\n\nHe said about half of students were behind grade level in at least one subject in the beginning of the 2021-2022 school year, but that number fell to 36 percent by the end of the school year.\n\n\n\n\"This progress is a testament to the enduring impacts our educators and school staffs can make on helping our students catch up, both academically and developmentally,\" Cardona wrote.",

        "description": "California is urging residents to curtail their energy use for a second day in a row as the state braces for a heat wave ahead of the Labor Day weekend. \n\n\n\nHuge swaths of the West could see temperatures surpass 100 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. The California Independent System Operator (ISO) has issued a \"Flex Alert\" for Thursday from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m., due to high heat across the state and supply uncertainties.\n\n\n\nThe flex alert was issued for a second day in a row and as the operator said it is experiencing some of the highest load levels of the year.\n\n\n\nResidents have been asked to pre-cool their homes before 4 p.m. and then set the thermostat to 78 degrees or higher from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. They have also been asked to cease the use of major appliances and to avoid charging their electric vehicles during the flex hours.\n\n\n\nIn a release, the California ISO added that overnight temperatures are staying high, which can cause buildings and infrastructure to retain heat and result in increased air conditioner use.\n\n\n\n\"During multiple days of heat, generators that have been running at top speed can fail ortrip offline unexpectedly. We also have to expect the unexpected, meaning we need to be prepared for any unplanned event that could tighten energy supplies,\" it added. \n\n\n\n\nCalifornia ISO has extended its Flex Alert into tomorrow, Sept. 1, from 4-9 p.m., calling for a second day of voluntary conservation due to continuing extreme temperatures pushing up energy demand. Read the news release here: https://t.co/P9nFSN2B12 pic.twitter.com/Y02YuHk7bm&mdash; California ISO (@California_ISO) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\n\nThe time slot was chosen as it is the \"most critical time\" on the grid, according to the operator, as solar production is \"going offline, but temperatures remain high.\"\n\n\n\n\"Turn off all unnecessary lights from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. Cook your meals earlier in the day to save energy and keep your home cooler,\" it added.\n\n\n\nThis comes as California's Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) declared a state of emergency Wednesday to increase power production and urged residents to reduce electricity use as a heat wave spread over the West.\n\n\n\nTemperatures that are expected to be 10 to 20 degrees above normal pushed up energy demand, primarily from air conditioning use, and tightened available power supplies. More alerts are likely through the Labor Day weekend, officials said.\n\n\n\nTemperatures on Sunday and Monday could hit up to 100 degrees on the coast and up to 115 inland, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\n\n“All of us have been trying to outrun Mother Nature, but it’s pretty clear Mother Nature has outrun us,” Newsom said. “The reality is we’re living in an era of extremes: extreme heat, extreme drought — and with the flooding we’re experiencing around the globe.”\n\n\n\nHowever, state officials have been criticized over the guidance. House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (La.) shared the notice in a tweet and said: \"This from the same state that’s going to force everyone to buy electric cars by 2035.\"\n\n\n\nIncludes Associated Press reporting",

Wade, Cook Political Report senior editor Dave Wasserman wrote. Democrats have outperformed expectations in every special election since the ruling.\n\n\n\nThey also also come as Republicans, some of whom predicted a potentially record “red wave” election year, have&nbsp;tempered expectations&nbsp;about the midterm elections this year.\n\n\n\nLast week, a separate Cook Political Report&nbsp;analysis&nbsp;said Republicans still look like the favorites to win control of the House in the midterm elections. But the publication revised its forecast down from Republicans winning 15 to 30 seats to winning 10 to 20 seats.\n\n\n\nThe five House districts Cook shifted on Thursday are:\n\n\n\nAlaska’s at-large district, from likely Republican to toss-up\n\n\n\nThe change comes after former Republican Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin lost a special election to Democrat Mary Peltola in the state's first election using a new ranked choice voting system. \n\n\n\nIt was the first time a Democrat had been elected to the seat since 1971. \n\n\n\nPeltola and Palin, as well as Republican Nick Begich and Libertarian Chris Bye, will be on the general election ranked choice ballot in November for a full term in the same seat.\n\n\n\nArizona’s 4th District, from lean Democratic to likely Democratic.\n\n\n\nDemocratic Rep. Greg Stanton will face Republican Kelly Cooper, a Marine veteran who was endorsed by Arizona GOP gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake.\n\n\n\nWasserman writes that, \"Cooper, a Marine veteran who owns BKD's Backyard sports bar and has questioned the integrity of the 2020 election, might be too far right for this left-trending, Biden +10 Tempe seat.\"\n\n\n\nMaryland’s 6th District, from lean Democratic to likely Democratic.\n\n\n\nDemocratic Rep. David Trone, founder of Total Wine &amp; More, has pumped his campaign with $10 million after his panhandle district became less Democratic due to redistricting. He faces Republican state Del. Neil Parrott.\n\n\n\n\"Any Republican scenario for ousting Trone likely involved a Larry Hogan-esque performance in the governor's race at the top of the ticket. But that went out the window when state Del. Dan Cox, whom Hogan has called 'not, in my opinion, mentally stable,' won the GOP primary,\" Wasserman wrote.\n\n\n\nNew York’s 3rd District, from toss-up to lean Democratic.\n\n\n\nIn the open Long Island seat being vacated by Rep. Tom Suozzi (D), who unsuccessfully ran for governor, Democratic National Committee member Rob Zimmerman will face Republican George Santos.\n\n\n\nVirginia’s 7th District, from toss-up to lean Democratic.\n\n\n\nRep. Abigail Spanberger (D) will face Republican former police officer Yesli Vega for the suburban Northern Virginia seat. \n\n\n\nSpanberger has long been considered one of the more vulnerable Democrats in the House, and this year's redistricting process shifted her seat away from the areas where she had the strongest support.\n\n\n\nBut an audio recording&nbsp;reported by Axios in which Vega expresses openness to the idea that it might be harder for women to get pregnant after rape, remarks that came just as the abortion issue was heating up, was thought to be a major help to Spanberger, who also holds a large financial edge.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  LA went 22-6 during the month The Dodgers followed up the second-best July in franchise history with the third-best August. They won just shy of 80 percent of their games over that two-month stretch, to all but lock in their place atop the standings in the National League.\nThis August, the Dodgers won 22 out of 28 games, and never lost two games in a row, almost a carbon copy, results-wise, of August 2021, when they were 21-6 and also never lost more than one in a row.\nAt .786 this month, the Dodgers had their third-best August in franchise history, trailing only the juggernaut 1953 Brooklyn team (25-6, .806) and the streaking 2013 Los Angeles squad (23-6, .793).\nAugust results\n22-6 record165 runs scored (5.89 per game, 2nd in MLB)74 runs allowed (2.64 per game, 1st in MLB).813 pythagorean win percentage (23-5)\nYear to date\n90-39 record691 runs scored (5.36 per game, 1st in MLB)405 runs allowed (3.14 per game, 1st in MLB).727 pythagorean win percentage (94-35)\nWinning 90 games, and not losing 40 games, before September is wild, but it’s also hard to compare with other years that may have started earlier. But using the schedule, the Dodgers are one of just 19 MLB teams dating back to 1901 to win 90 of their first 129 games. The 2017 team was 91-38 through 129 games, for comparison.\nSince integration, only seven teams have 90 wins through 129 games.\n\nOnce Chris Taylor returned from a broken foot, the regular position players were all healthy for the bulk of August. The “usual nine” — the opening day lineup that made the vast majority of starts during the month (81 percent), with Joey Gallo (15 starts, 56 plate appearances) and Trayce Thompson (11 starts, 55 PA) essentially serving as a timeshare for one spot.\n\nMagic Mookie\nMookie Betts drove the bus on offense with another strong month, hitting .330/.383/.697 in August. He tied for the major league lead with nine home runs during the month, and led everyone with 30 runs scored.\nIt’s the second time Betts scored 30 runs in a month this season, touching the plate 31 times in May as well. This was the fourth 30-run month of Betts’ career, along with 33 runs in July 2019 and 30 in May 2016.\nThe stingy ones\nJulio Urías has been on a great stretch for nearly three months, but in August he was especially effective, allowing only three runs in 30 innings, with 34 strikeouts.\nTony Gonsolin was on that same track, winning all four starts during the month, allowing only two runs in 23⅔ innings. But he didn’t make his last scheduled August start, instead hitting the injured list with right forearm inflammation.\nOut of the bullpen, Evan Phillips allowed no runs in his 11⅔ innings in August, and ended the month by retiring 29 batters in a row. Lefty Alex Vesia was also spotless, giving up no runs in his 11 innings, with 17 strikeouts.\nBack in the swing of things\nMax Muncy is fully healthy again, and also re-found his swing thanks to a slight adjustment. That got him back to driving the ball hard and controlling the strike zone again, and resulted in almost as many home runs in August (7) as he had in the first four months of the season (9).\nHe hit .261/.352/.554 with a 150 wRC+ for the month.\n\nWhat’s ahead\nThe Dodgers have 33 games remaining in the regular season, counting five games in October. Twenty of those games are at Dodger Stadium, where the Dodgers have the best home record in the majors at 45-16 (.738). The 20 home games are tied for second-most on any team’s schedule, behind only the Guardians, who have 22 games remaining in Cleveland.",

        "description": "Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Spencer Torkelson and Ryan Kreidler will join the team today but probably won’t see action until Friday against the Royals. If the 2022 Seattle Mariners ultimately hold on to a wild card berth, they may have the Detroit Tigers to thank in part. The first two games of the series have not gone well at all for the home team. The surging Mariners will look for the sweep on Thursday afternoon, a sweep that would help them carry some momentum into the stretch drive, but they’ll have Eduardo Rodriguez to deal with to get there.\nThe Tigers will also welcome in some reinforcements on Thursday. Spencer Torkelson has been recalled from Triple-A Toledo as rosters expand on September 1 to 28 players. The wayward first baseman has looked to be trying to quiet his hands in Toledo, and tinkered a bit with short leg kicks and toe taps trying to find a better timing mechanism. Overall, while he’s been productive for the Hens, no signs of an imminent breakout were apparent. If, as has been posited, Torkelson is a little reluctant to make a bigger change in season, getting his butt kicked for another month in the majors might be a good motivator heading into the offseason. Even better would be if he’s sorted out some of his issues. Either way, bringing him back makes plenty of sense.\nAlong with Torkelson, Michael Pineda has been reinstated after a rehab assignment, and is slated to start on Saturday at home against the Royals. To clear a spot, shortstop Zack Short was optioned back to Toledo.\nFinally, shortstop Ryan Kreidler has also been called up as the 28th man. After a breakout campaign in 2021, Kreidler was expected to get his first look at the majors this spring. Unfortunately, a fractured hand sank those plans, and left him rehabbing the injury most of the year. Since his return to full-time action he’s been solid for the Mud Hens, but hasn’t really gotten on the kind of roll we saw last year. Hopefully he can finish strong and gain some experience that will benefit his offseason work. Kreidler will be added to the 40-man roster in the process, which would’ve had to happen this offseason prior to the Rule 5 draft anyway. RHP Rony Garcia has been transferred to the 60-day injured list to create a 40-man vacancy for Kreidler. That puts the decision on who to cut from the 40 off into the offseason, when, presumably, a new general manager will be in place to make the decision.\n\nDetroit Tigers (50-80) at Seattle Mariners (72-58)\nTime/Place: 1:10 p.m., Comerica ParkSB Nation Site: Lookout LandingMedia: Bally Sports Detroit, MLB.TV, Tigers Radio NetworkPitching Matchup: LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (3-3, 3.60 ERA) vs. RHP Logan Gilbert (10-5, 3.49 ERA)\n\n\n(2/2)The Tigers announced the following roster moves:*To make room for Kreidler on the 40-man roster, transferred RHP Rony Garcia to the 60-day injured list— Tigers PR (@DetroitTigersPR) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nSo far, Eduardo Rodriguez’s return to action has gone quite well. He’ll give the Tigers their best chance to win a game and avoid the sweep as long as his command is sharp. He’s allowed just one earned run in 11 innings since his return. The stuff hasn’t necessarily looked that sharp, but Rodriguez has the ability to work with less than 100 percent of his best. The Mariners will certainly test that ability if he doesn’t have all three pitches working.\nAs for Logan Gilbert, the right-hander should find Comerica Park to his liking as a fly ball pitcher. Gilbert has pretty pedestrian strikeout numbers, and will surrender an average number of home runs, so the Tigers don’t have much excuse not to put up a few runs against him. However, the way things have gone for the offense we wouldn’t be surprised if Gilbert keeps them lifting fly balls to center field for routine outs much of the afternoon either.\nUnlike some other Mariners pitchers, Gilbert has stuck mostly with the fourseamer this year. He pumps the heater in there at an average of 96 mph, and while the movement is nothing special, he tends to get his share of whiffs and induces a lot of lazy fly balls with it. A good curveball and a solid changeup are his two best secondaries, with the latter only occasionally broken out against left-handed hitters. Gilbert throws his 87 mph slider more than either, but it’s a bit hit or miss for him with the slider. He gets plenty of whiffs, but hitters will do damage if he leaves it up over the plate, and he has a tendency to do so.\nOverall the pitching matchup is pretty even. It would be nice to see the Tigers get a little boost from their new arrivals, but after playing in Rochester last night, neither Torkelson nor Kreidler will be in the lineup until Friday, when the Kansas City Royals come to town. So it’ll be up to the regular group to get it done. Personally, I’m a little tired of seeing Kerry Carpenter sit on the bench when a right-hander is starting, but perhaps he’ll get in the game later on. Eric Haase will DH in this one, with Barnhart and his ability to steal strikes to the sides of the plate a benefit to E-Rod. \n\n\nWrapping up the series with the Mariners this afternoon. pic.twitter.com/SMFoek11Tj— Detroit Tigers (@tigers) September 1, 2022",

        "description": "James Ehnes/BBCSO/Andrew Davis(Chandos)Conductor Andrew Davis and warm-toned soloist James Ehnes vividly connect Berg’s early music to his later scores and the composers who were his modelsAlban Berg’s two best known orchestral works naturally provide the headlines, but it is the pieces that begin this disc that mark it out from most of its competitors. Last year the conductor Andrew Davis made orchestral versions of two early scores by Berg – his Piano Sonata Op 1, completed by 1909, while he was studying with Schoenberg, and the unfinished Passacaglia on a 12-note theme, which is the only substantial surviving fragment (four minutes long) of what was possibly going to be a symphony, conceived just before the outbreak of the first world war. Both pieces have been orchestrated and even recorded before but, as he writes in a sleeve note, Davis felt that those versions had not really evoked the Viennese sound world of Mahler, Schoenberg, Zemlinsky and Schreker that Berg inhabited at that time.Certainly his versions vividly connect this music not only to the composers who were his models, but to Berg’s own later scores, especially to the Three Orchestral Pieces, which were conceived at about the same time as the Passacaglia. Presented in this way, the sonata particularly sounds more forward-looking, more Bergian, than it often does on the piano, while the Passacaglia clearly shows its links to the work in the same form that Berg’s colleague and fellow Schoenberg pupil Anton Webern had designated as his Op 1.

        "description": "Venice film festival: The actor is utterly magnetic as an imperious maestro in this ultra-stylish drama with a shocking climaxNo one but Cate Blanchett could have delivered the imperious hauteur necessary for this engrossing movie from writer-director Todd Field, about a globally renowned conductor heading for a crisis or crackup or creative breakthrough. No one but Blanchett has the right way of wearing a two-piece black suit with an open-necked white shirt, the way of shaking her hair loose at moments of abandon, the way of letting her face become a Tutankhamun mask of contempt. She holds the screen for two and a half hours, aided by Florian Hoffmeister’s epic cinematography, a tour de force of control, effortlessly keeping us waiting and guessing for an almost tantrically deferred climax. And when it comes, it is certainly shocking, if a little melodramatic and even absurd in ways that this ultra-stylish movie can’t quite absorb.She plays Lydia Tár, imagined to be principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, addressed by colleagues as “Maestro”. There are lots of scenes shot in the real concert hall, and Tár has an onstage interview with a real journalist: the New Yorker’s Adam Gopnik, playing himself – which could have been a gimmicky and self-conscious shortcut to authenticity, but isn’t. Tár is passionate, demanding, autocratic, with a rockstar prestige and an international touring lifestyle approaching that of the super-rich, and now very keyed up as she approaches her new challenge: a live recording of Mahler for Deutsche Grammophon. Tár is in a live-in relationship with her first violinist, played by Nina Hoss and they have a child. They live in a spectacular apartment, but Tár sentimentally keeps her scuzzy old Berlin flat as an office, bolt-hole and composition studio. Continue reading...",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/athletics-promote-ken-waldichuk-cody-thomas-dfa-david-mckay.html",
        "description": "The A&#8217;s announced Thursday that right-hander David McKay has been designated for assignment. His spot on the 40-man roster will go to lefty Ken Waldichuk, whose previously reported promotion to the big leagues is now official. Oakland also recalled outfielder Cody Thomas from Triple-A Las Vegas.\nMcKay, 27, was a waiver claim out of the Rays organization back in July. He pitched 2 2/3 innings with the A&#8217;s, who were his third big league team of the season (Rays, Yankees). All told, McKay allowed five runs in 6 2/3 Major League innings between the three teams in 2022. He&#8217;s tallied 33 1/3 innings in his big league career, dating back to 2020, and has a 6.21 ERA with an above-average 24.7% strikeout rate but a grisly 14.7% walk rate.\nMcKay has also pitched with the Triple-A affiliates for all three of those organizations in 2022, working to a collective 4.50 ERA with a 25.1% strikeout rate that&#8217;s similar to his big league rate and a 10.4% walk rate (an improvement over his MLB numbers but still much higher than average). He&#8217;ll be placed on waivers or released within the week, as he&#8217;s ineligible to be traded at this point.\nThomas, like Waldichuk, will make his big league debut when he first takes the field for the A&#8217;s. The 27-year-old was a 13th-round pick by the Dodgers back in 2016 but landed with the A&#8217;s organization as part of the trade that sent infielder Sheldon Neuse to Los Angeles. (Neuse has since returned to the A&#8217;s on a waiver claim.)\nThomas has missed nearly the entire season after undergoing surgery to repair his Achilles tendon in Spring Training, but he went out on a minor league rehab assignment in mid-August and got 10 games under his belt before today&#8217;s call to The Show. Thomas hit just .226/.306/.419 in 36 minor league plate appearances, but the A&#8217;s have surely wanted to get a look at him ever since last year&#8217;s massive .289/.363/.665 showing in Triple-A (143 wRC+).\nDespite tallying just 245 plate appearances in 2021, Thomas racked up 18 home runs, 20 doubles and four triples. He whiffed in 31.8% of his plate appearances, which is an obvious concern, but Thomas also posted a solid 10.2% walk rate in Vegas a year ago. He&#8217;ll turn 28 next month, making him much older than the standard &#8220;prospect,&#8221; but last year&#8217;s big showing certainly merits at least a late audition at the MLB level.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/astros-trade-lewis-brinson-giants.html",
        "description": "The Giants have acquired outfielder Lewis Brinson in a trade with the Astros, as first indicated on the transactions log at MLB.com. Brinson was eligible to be traded by virtue of the fact that he&#8217;s on a minor league deal with Houston and has not, at any point, been on a Major League roster or injured list this season.\n[Related: How to Acquire Players After the Trade Deadline]\nOnce one of the sport&#8217;s consensus top prospects, Brinson&#8217;s blend of raw power, speed and a plus throwing arm have never been enough to outshine his strikeout issues, minimal walk rate and lack of hard contact. A first-round pick by the Rangers back in 2012, he was traded to the Brewers as the centerpiece in Texas&#8217; acquisition of former All-Star catcher Jonathan Lucroy and then to Miami as the headliner in Milwaukee&#8217;s acquisition of 2018 NL MVP Christian Yelich.\nBrinson was widely considered to be among baseball&#8217;s 30 best prospects from 2016-18, but he&#8217;s now appeared in 341 big league games &#8212; mostly with the Marlins &#8212; and posted just a .199/.248/.323 batting line in 1111 plate appearances. He&#8217;s punched out in 28.2% of his Major League plate appearances against just a 5% walk rate, and when he&#8217;s made contact, the plus raw power Brinson possesses hasn&#8217;t shined through, likely due to his poor pitch selection (career 40.2% chase rate on pitches off the plate). Brinson&#8217;s 88.6 mph average exit velocity and 37.1% hard-hit rate are both pedestrian marks that align roughly with the collective league averages over his big league tenure.\nAll that said, there&#8217;s no denying that Brinson has posted strong results in Triple-A this season. Through 364 trips to the plate in Sugar Land, he&#8217;s slashed .299/.356/.574 with 22 home runs, 21 doubles, five triples and five steals (in eight tries). He&#8217;s still fanned in 28% of his plate appearances, however, and his 7.1% walk rate doesn&#8217;t suggest he&#8217;s become much more selective at the dish. Brinson has also had comparable Triple-A success in the past (.331/.400/.562 in a similar sample of plate appearances back in 2017).\nThe Astros seemingly weren&#8217;t going to bring Brinson to the big leagues and have several players they&#8217;d like to get some playing time in Triple-A, including recently optioned center fielder Jake Meyers. A trade of Brinson to the Giants gives Houston some extra playing time for younger players who are viewed as potential contributors beyond the 2022 season; Brinson would simply have been a free agent at season&#8217;s end unless added to the 40-man roster.\nFor the Giants, Brinson will give them some depth and a potential September call-up to the join the outfield mix. If he indeed reaches the big leagues with San Francisco and shows some signs of improvement against MLB pitching, he&#8217;d be controllable for another three years via arbitration. It may be a long shot, but given what&#8217;s surely a minimal cost of acquisition &#8212; the teams have not yet announced the moves, and the transactions log does not specify a return &#8212; there&#8217;s little harm in rolling the dice on a former top prospect who won&#8217;t turn 29 until next May.",

        "description": "Venice film festival: A fictional biography set in the world of classical music follows Lydia Tár, the imperious but troubled Maestro, in an ultra-stylish drama with a shocking climaxNo one but Cate Blanchett could have delivered the imperious hauteur necessary for this engrossing movie from writer-director Todd Field, about a globally renowned conductor heading for a crisis or crackup or creative breakthrough. No one but Blanchett has the right way of wearing a two-piece black suit with an open-necked white shirt, the way of shaking her hair loose at moments of abandon, the way of letting her face become a Tutankhamun mask of contempt. She holds the screen for two and a half hours, aided by Florian Hoffmeister’s epic cinematography, a tour de force of control, effortlessly keeping us waiting and guessing for an almost tantrically deferred climax. And when it comes, it is certainly shocking, if a little melodramatic and even absurd in ways that this ultra-stylish movie can’t quite absorb.She plays Lydia Tár, imagined to be principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, addressed by colleagues as “Maestro”. There are lots of scenes shot in the real concert hall, and Tár has an onstage interview with a real journalist: the New Yorker’s Adam Gopnik, playing himself – which could have been a gimmicky and self-conscious shortcut to authenticity, but isn’t. Tár is passionate, demanding, autocratic, with a rockstar prestige and an international touring lifestyle approaching that of the super-rich, and now very keyed up as she approaches her new challenge: a live recording of Mahler for Deutsche Grammophon. Tár is in a live-in relationship with her first violinist, played by Nina Hoss and they have a child. They live in a spectacular apartment, but Tár sentimentally keeps her scuzzy old Berlin flat as an office, bolt-hole and composition studio.There are problems in Tár’s life. She runs a mentoring scholarship programme for women, administered by a tiresome, oleaginous would-be conductor, played by Mark Strong, and there are rumours that this is a source of young women with whom Tár has affairs. Her assistant, played by Noémie Merlant (another would-be conductor) appears to be someone else she is keeping on an emotional string and she is being stalked by another former mentee who has become obsessed with her; Tár has furthermore conceived a tendresse for the new Russian cellist. Meanwhile, her guest masterclass at Juilliard goes horribly sour when a young student, identifying as BIPOC pangender, presumes to dismiss Bach on ideological grounds and Tár humiliates this young Gen Z.And all the time, Tár suspects that there is something wrong: she is twitchy, paranoid and insomniac. We know from the outset that she is effectively being spied upon. There are strange sounds, intrusions and things out of place. Tár threatens a little girl at her daughter’s school that she hears is a bully. And the music itself, so far from being an emollient, amplifies the violence just beneath the surface. It could be that Todd Field has fallen under the spell of the maestro himself, Austrian director Michael Haneke, with these ideas about surveillance, the return of the repressed and the tyranny and cruelty in the bürgerliche European classical music tradition.Tár has a job in which hubris pretty much comes with the territory: like a field marshal, you have a baton. There’s no point in being a conductor who is shy and retiring: the job requires you to stand in front of musicians, on a podium, directing them with extravagant gestures. And Tár has a natural way with all this, with all the politics, and the diplomacy and the media-management. She has invented herself through conducting: no other profession and no other kind of musical career could have done it. And there is something genuinely moving when we see her watch an old video of Leonard Bernstein teaching children about music. I am not sure that all the film’s disparate and intriguing tics and hints and feints all come satisfactorily together, but what a colossal performance from Cate Blanchett. Continue reading...",

This is the brand’s second generation of Nintendo Switch-like controllers for iOS devices that make mobile gaming feel more like a real console experience.\nIf you were thinking of upgrading from the original Razer Kishi or iOS controller, then there are a few benefits. Two new multi-function shoulder buttons can be remapped in the Nexus app (Razer’s own gaming hub) if you enjoy playing more complex games, and there’s a dedicated button that will take you to the Nexus app directly, though its capabilities of handling iOS integration remain to be seen given that Apple doesn’t allow for native app streaming.\n\nC...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

It’s an amazing act of cowardice, and ultimately, it’s treasonous to the conservative cause.&#8221;\nHe added: &#8220;If you want to trash-talk our candidates to help the Democrats, pipe down. That’s not what leaders do.&#8221;\n\nMeanwhile, Scott told Politico: &#8220;Sen. McConnell and I clearly have a strategic disagreement here. We have great candidates.&#8221;",

        "description": "Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Teams can have 28 players in September The Royals have recalled outfielder Nate Eaton and pitcher Daniel Mengden from Triple-A Omaha as MLB rosters expand to 28 for the month of September. Mengden will start Thursday’s contest against the Chicago White Sox.\nThis will be Eaton’s third stint with the Royals this season. The former 21st round pick out of Virginia Military Institute has hit .182/.255/.318 with one home run and two steals in 19 games. He brings some positional versatility with an ability to play all three outfield positions, and has played some third base in the minors as well. He was hitting .295/.376/.510 with 9 home runs and 11 steals in 54 games for Omaha after beginning the season in Double-A Northwest Arkansas.\nMengden was with the team for a few weeks in June, appearing in four games in relief. In 4 1/3 innings pitched, he struck out six without allowing a walk, and giving up two runs, one earned. The 29-year-old right-hander is a six-year MLB veteran, having pitched in 60 games, mostly as a starter, for the Oakland Athletics. Overall he has 307 MLB innings with a 4.60 ERA. He does not miss many bats with a fastball that sits in the low 90s, but he has a deep arsenal of pitches that includes a fastball, cutter, change up, and curve.\nThe White Sox also called up two players in anticipation of this afternoon’s game, bringing up outfielder Adam Haseley and right-handed pitcher Matt Foster.",

Rick Scott (R-Fla.), chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), is acknowledging his “strategic disagreement” with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) over the GOP’s battle to take control of the upper chamber in the midterm elections.\n\n\n\n“Sen. McConnell and I clearly have a strategic disagreement here … We have great candidates,” Scott told Politico in an interview on Wednesday, which was published Thursday. “He wants to do the same thing I want to do: I want to get a majority. And I think it’s important that we’re all cheerleaders for our candidates.”\n\n\n\nScott’s comments follow remarks McConnell made last month, when the GOP leader said Republicans have a better chance of flipping the House than the Senate, citing concerns over “candidate quality.”\n\n\n\n“I think there’s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. Senate races are just different — they’re statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,” McConnell told reporters in Kentucky.\n\n\n\n“Right now, we have a 50-50 Senate and a 50-50 country, but I think when all is said and done this fall, we’re likely to have an extremely close Senate, either our side up slightly or their side up slightly,” McConnell added.\n\n\n\nThe “candidate quality” comment was interpreted as a veiled reference to GOP nominees for Senate who are backed by former President Trump and have struggled to pull ahead of their Democratic opponents in recent polls. The group includes Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, Herschel Walker in Georgia, Blake Masters in Arizona and J.D. Vance in Ohio.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, however, McConnell aired a more optimistic tone, telling reporters in Kentucky — after he hosted a fundraiser for Oz, Walker and Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.), who is running for Senate in North Carolina — that the candidates have “a good chance of winning” their races.\n\n\n\nSpecifically on Oz, who has been at the center of a number of controversies, McConnell said he has “great confidence” in the candidate, adding “I think Oz has a great shot at winning” in his race against Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D). \n\n\n\nScott argued to Politico that hurling \"trash talk\" at GOP candidates will hurt the party's chances of winning in November and impair its ability to fundraise.\n\n\n\n\"If you trash talk our candidates … you hurt our chances of winning, and you hurt our candidates’ ability to raise money,\" Scott said. \"I know they’re good candidates, because I’ve been talking to them and they’re working their butts off.\"\n\n\n\nIn an op-ed posted to the Washington Examiner on Thursday, Scott said criticizing candidates shows \"contempt for the voters\" who put them on the ticket.\n\n\n\nScott’s jabs at McConnell over midterm candidates are not his first clash with the Republican leader.\n\n\n\nIn February, the NRSC chair released a memo outlining his vision for a Republican agenda should the GOP take control of the Senate come November. Among the tenets in the 31-page document was finishing the wall on the southern border and naming it after Trump, and requiring that all Americans pay some income tax.\n\n\n\nMcConnell distanced himself from the agenda, telling reporters at a press conference “We will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years.”\n\n\n\n“That will not be part of the Republican Senate majority agenda,” he added.\n\n\n\nThe Senate leader has instead sought to cast the midterms as a referendum on President Biden.\n\n\n\nThe newest disagreement between McConnell, who controls a massive campaign bank account, and Scott, who is tasked with leading campaign strategy, comes at a particularly precarious moment for Republicans, whose odds of flipping the Senate in November appear to be dimming.\n\n\n\nHistorically speaking, the party that does not control the White House typically picks up seats in the midterm elections. But according to FiveThirtyEight, Democrats have better than 2 to 1 odds to win the upper chamber over Republicans.",

Flu shots are approved through a similar process.\n\n\n\nFauci added that he hoped the U.S. will continue to improve on the existing vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.\n\n\n\n“One of the mistakes we’ve made is that we concentrate on the problem that’s right in front of you, and put off focusing on what might be a problem in the future,” said Fauci.",

        "description": "Incumbent Democrats hold narrow leads over their Republican challengers in races for Senate and governor in Nevada, according to a poll released Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe AARP poll found Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D) leads former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt (R) by about 4 points in the Senate race, 44 to 40 percent, while Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) leads Sheriff Joe Lombardo (R) by 3 points in the gubernatorial battle, 41 to 38 percent.\n\n\n\nNine percent of respondents were undecided in the Senate race, while 7 percent said they would choose another candidate. In the gubernatorial race, 10 percent were undecided and just as many said they would prefer another candidate.\n\n\n\nThe poll found even tighter match-ups when the two major-party candidates are polled head-to-head. Cortez Masto leads Laxalt in that poll by 1 point, 48 to 47 percent, while Lombardo leads Sisolak by 2 points, 48 to 46 percent. \n\n\n\nLombardo owes his lead in that match-up to a more than 30-point advantage among respondents who originally said they supported a third-party candidate or none of the listed candidates. \n\n\n\nThe Democrats hold relatively narrow leads among Hispanic voters in the state, a large voting bloc that has leaned Democrat historically but has trended toward Republicans in recent elections.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCortez Masto leads Laxalt by 9 points in the full-ballot race and by 7 points in a head-to-head match-up among these voters. Sisolak leads by 9 points in the full-ballot race but only by 2 points in the head-to-head race. \n\n\n\nThe AARP noted that voters ages 50 and older are expected to make up a majority of those participating in this year’s elections in the state, and Republicans appear to have an advantage among these voters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe two Senate candidates are tied at 44 percent each among older voters in a full-ballot race, while Laxalt leads by 4 points in a head-to-head match-up among that age group. Lombardo leads Sisolak in the gubernatorial race by 1 point among older voters in the full ballot and by 7 points in a head-to-head match-up.\n\n\n\nAll four candidates have negative net favorability among voters, but Laxalt and Sisolak are viewed somewhat less favorably than their respective challengers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLaxalt is viewed favorably by 39 percent of respondents and unfavorably by 47 percent, while Cortez Masto is viewed favorably by 45 percent and unfavorably by 48 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSisolak is viewed favorably by 42 percent and unfavorably by 53 percent, while Lombardo is viewed favorably by 40 percent and unfavorably by 46 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe poll was conducted by Fabrizio Ward and Impact Research on behalf of AARP among 1,332 likely voters Aug. 16-24. The sample included an oversample of 550 likely voters older than 50 and another oversample of 282 Hispanic voters over the age of 50.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe margin of error for the overall statewide sample was 4.4 points, while the margin of error for respondents over 50 was 3.4&nbsp;points. The margin for Hispanic voters over 50 was 4.9 points.",

        "description": "Russian T-72 tanks are winning big — at the glitzy tank biathlon competitions at Alabino, near Moscow. These are the same tanks that lack at the front.\n\n\n\nThere’s a special word for this is Russian: pokazukha. It means showing off. Pokazukha is essentially lying. Like the proverbial profusion of words for different kinds of snow in Eskimo languages, Russian language has an overabundance of terms that describe different shades of lying, particularly lying to superiors: pokazukha, ochkovtiratelstvo, tufta and lipa.\n\n\n\nThe only reason Putin’s regime went to war is because Putin believed his own lies. He was hoisted by his own propaganda.\n\n\n\nGarbage in, garbage out.\n\n\n\nPutin’s war was doomed. It was doomed the moment he acted on the belief that FSB infiltrated Ukraine with thousands of agents that would overthrow Kiev’s regime for him; it was all tufta.\n\n\n\nIt was doomed the moment Putin believed that he really has new wonder weapons. That was tufta as well.\n\n\n\nPavel Filatiev, 34, a Russian soldier who escaped the war and wrote a scathing memoir, described how the truck that took him to war had no brakes. The real condition of Russian tanks? One of my correspondents was a conscript back in 1980s. At that time, he told me, the tanks in his division were standing in their boxes in two rows. In the front row were the tanks that were able to start and exit the box on their own; the tanks in the second row were tied to the first by cables.\n\n\n\nWhen the Russian army did not take Kiev and eventually rolled off, leaving behind the bodies of civilians with hands tied behind their backs, Putin regrouped and started a glacial advance in Donbas, falling back on Stalin’s tactics — barrage to scorch the cities before advancing the cannon fodder.\n\n\n\nBut this tactic is also doomed. When Stalin was razing the cities, he repopulated them later with peasants. Putin has no rural population to compensate. When Stalin used people as cannon fodder, he had an inexhaustible supply. Putin doesn’t: he tries to fight Stalin’s war without Stalin’s means.\n\n\n\nThe real goal of Putin’s Donbas campaign was to take control of the unique Donbas water supply system which comprises 16 miles of pipes over gullies and railways and is situated near Slavyansk and Kramatorsk. Without it, Donbas would revert to its pristine condition of arid steppe. The system is irreparablу wrecked, and right now Putin has no hope of taking it.\n\n\n\nThe troops have reportedly started faking it; for in the Russian army you are taught — to perfection — never to dispute an order from above, however insane it may be. You just don’t carry it out. “Russian commanders right now are busily imitating military activities, for the art of the fake is the key to survival in the Russian armу,” says Alexei Arestovich, 47, advisor to the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\n\nWhy should you fight if you can lie?\n\n\n\nThe Russian army was shelling Ukrainian cities and claiming that Ukrainians were shelling themselves; and instead of hitting key military targets with precision missiles, it declared a military target whatever was hit.\n\n\n\nIt was tufta all over again, mingled this time with children’s blood.\n\n\n\nThey call Putin’s regime fascism. I would call it fakism. This sociopathic regime will never stop committing crimes — because it’s convinced it can ascribe its crimes to its victims.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian HIMARS supplied by the U.S. destroyed Russian ammo dumps, and the creeping advance of Ukrainian troops started to pose danger for Russians holding Kherson, the only big population center Russia seized on the right side of Dnipro.\n\n\n\nPutin, still blinded by his own tufta, made a strategic mistake – he started sending in troops across the river to reinforce Kherson. The bridges were blown, and the troops were cut not in two, but in three, by the Dnipro and it tributary, as Oleg Zhdanov, 56, a military expert and a former member of Ukrainian General Staff points out. HARMs supplied by the U.S. took out Russian air defense — and then the Russian ammo dumps and airfields in Crimea started exploding. It was a wakeup call for Putin, whose propaganda calls Crimea sacred.\n\n\n\nSo why are the Ukrainian troops not advancing by leaps and bounds? The answer is simple. The Ukrainian army is still outgunned and has little armor. Before the war, Russia had over 12,000 tanks and 26,000 infantry fighting vehicles, and quantity is a quality of its own. The U.S. has not yet supplied Ukraine with a single tank or IFV; Europe sent about 300. It is hard to advance on foot in a 21st century war.\n\n\n\nAs the authors of the recent joint letter to The Hill put it, “By providing aid sufficient to produce a stalemate, but not enough to roll back Russian territorial gains, the Biden administration may be unintentionally seizing defeat from the jaws of victory.” \n\n\n\nSo, what is going to happen when Putin wakes up? The answer is dire — his regime is going to become even more paranoid, truly unsane.\n\n\n\nThere’s just one force that can prevent this scenario: the Ukrainian army. If it deals a decisive blow to Putin’s bloody tufta and takes back Crimea, the turbulence in the Kremlin will just become too great. The gap between the reality and the tank biathlon will swallow Putin.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the world will have to deal with an insane regime for another quarter of century.\n\n\n\nJust give Ukraine weapons. Now.\n\n\n\nYulia Latynina, a journalist, worked for Echo of Moscow radio station and the Novaya Gazeta newspaper until they were shut down as part of the current war in Ukraine. She is a recipient of the U.S. State Department’s Defender of Freedom award.",

        "description": "Today, Lenovo has taken the wraps off of the new 16-inch IdeaPad 5i Chromebook, and this one has a very special feature up its sleeve that we&#8217;ve never seen in a Chromebook up to this point: a 120hz screen.  I suppose it was a matter of time as ChromeOS has supported high-refresh screens for quite a while at this point, but I am personally excited to see this development in the hopes that other manufacturers are lining up to follow down the road as well.\n\n\n\nLenovo IdeaPad 5i Chromebook Key Specs\n\n\n\nIntel&#xAE; Core&#x2122; i3-1215U or Intel&#xAE; Pentium&#xAE; 8505Up to 8GB of RAMUp to 512GB of SSD storage (eMMC up to 128GB)16-inch 16:10 QHD screen at 350 nits, 100% SRGB, and 120hz (or)16-inch 16:10 FHD screen at 300 nits, 45% NTSC, and 60hz1080p webcam12-hour battery356.5mm x 253mm x 19.95mm4.1 lbs2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C2x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-AMicroSD card slotheadphone/mic jackWi-Fi 6EBluetooth 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall spec sheet on this one is pretty impressive, and Lenovo is generally great at delivering excellent keyboards and trackpads on their devices.  The addition of a large, 16:10 display that is bright and has that silky-smooth refresh rate should only add to their overall-solid equation.\n\n\n\nWe don&#8217;t yet have our hands on this particular Chromebook, but I like what I&#8217;m seeing.  If the build quality is sturdy and the price is reasonable, this could be a great family Chromebook for many users.  Larger Chromebooks can easily fall prey to flimsiness if the build quality isn&#8217;t top of mind for the manufacturer, and Lenovo has put out some larger, low-priced Chromebooks in the past that felt wobbly and unbalanced.  With a small price tag, that is easier to forgive.  If the IdeaPad 51 creeps up in the $600-$700 range, that won&#8217;t be well received by most consumers.\n\n\n\nFor now, the IdeaPad 5i Chromebook doesn&#8217;t have US pricing, but Lenovo is announcing availability in September for &#x20AC;549 in the EMEA.  I&#8217;d assume a Q4 release would make sense in the US, but with this Chromebook sporting a standout screen and decent internals, I&#8217;d doubt it will be less than $599 with the 120hz screen.  As long as it feels well made, however, I think $599-$699 would be a fine price point.\n\n\n\n120hz is for gaming, right?\n\n\n\nThe oddity here is the fact that Lenovo isn&#8217;t making a version of this with a Core i5 or Core i7 inside.  As we all know, Steam gaming for Chromebooks is just around the corner, but the upgraded GPU present in the Core i5 and i7 is a necessary part of that equation.  With this 120hz screen, you&#8217;d think Lenovo would have a version available with gaming-ready processors, but they don&#8217;t at this point.\n\n\n\nFor what its worth, I run my secondary monitor on my desk at 120hz every day and really enjoy it for the day-to-day tasks, too.  At this point, I&#8217;m not really doing any gaming on my Chromebook and I still thoroughly enjoy the smooth animations of the entire OS when available.  Though the IdeaPad 5i won&#8217;t be using that sweet refresh rate for Steam games, there are other advantages to having it around.\n\n\n\nWe obviously have to get one of these in-hand before we pass judgement on it, but I&#8217;m really excited to see what working on a Chromebook with a high-refresh screen feels like.  I notice the drop in smoothness when I go back and forth between my Chromebook&#8217;s internal screen and my extended display on a pretty regular basis.  Having a Chromebook with a big, bright, smooth screen will be a very nice option for sure when it becomes available.  As soon as it does, you know we&#8217;ll have a look at it.  Stay tuned.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/lenovo-announces-first-thinkcentre-chromebox-in-7-years/",
        "description": "We&#8217;ve been tracking 12th Gen Intel Chromeboxes for quite some time now. Unlike Chromebooks, Chromeboxes generally see a two-year release cycle that skips a generation of Intel CPUs. The last ChromeOS mini PCs to hit the market were powered by 10th Gen Comet Lake processors. The new generation of Chromebox devices will be powered by the significantly more powerful 12th Gen Alder Lake chipsets. Some of those CPUs, Core i-5 and up, will also feature Intel&#8217;s Iris Xe graphics that support Steam gaming on ChromeOS.\n\n\n\nChromeboxes may be a bit of a niche device but the appeal for a lightweight, powerful and secure desktop computer is most definitely expanding and Chromeboxes check off all the &#8220;boxes.&#8221; Over the past few years, we&#8217;ve seen Chromeboxes from most of the major OEMs and as of late, more &#8220;white label&#8221; devices from companies like CTL, Promethean, and others. While I expected ASUS or HP to be one of the first to market with a new 12th Gen Chromebox, Lenovo has actually arrived &#8211; out of left field &#8211; to announce the first-ever Alder Lake Chromebox.\n\n\n\nThinkCentre M60q Chromebox\n\n\n\nIf you&#8217;re wondering why this is odd, I&#8217;ll tell you. Lenovo has a strong presence in the mini PC market with the company&#8217;s line of ThinkCentre Tiny desktop devices. That said, Lenovo hasn&#8217;t produced a ChromeOS mini PC since 2015 which seems odd to me given the ever-growing presence of ChromeOS in the Enterprise sector. Whatever the reason for bowing out, Lenovo is now back with the latest ThinkCentre Chromebox that&#8217;s powered by Intel&#8217;s powerful 12th Gen CPUs. Here&#8217;s a look at the new Tiny ChromeOS PC from Lenovo. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this device will lean towards the Enterprise types, Lenovo made it a point to say that a consumer model would be available that didn&#8217;t come with a Chrome Enterprise Upgrade installed. The ThinkCentre M60q will feature up to a 12th Gen Intel Core i-5. The max amount of RAM wasn&#8217;t listed in the press release but it&#8217;s equipped with up to 2 DDR4 SODIMM 3200MHz slots which means that it should support at least 32GB if you want to upgrade it. There&#8217;s also no word on the storage but I presume that it will have an M.2 slot so it should easily handle 1TB or more easily. \n\n\n\nAround the outside, the ThinkCentre M60q features four USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports on the back along with an HDMI 2.0 port, Display Port 1.4, 1 x Flex I/O port for DP or HDMI, and a Gigabit Ethernet port. On the front, you&#8217;ll find two more Gen 2 USB 3.2 ports, a single USB-C, and a 3.5mm audio jack. Port selection on this Chromebox is killer and should be ample for any use case. The M60q is also equipped with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.0 for fast, stable connectivity. \n\n\n\nWe aren&#8217;t sure what the entry-level version of the new ThinkCentre Chromebox will offer but I&#8217;d wager that it will be a Pentium Gold. The all-new 12th Gen Chromebox from Lenovo won&#8217;t be available until February of 2023 with a starting price of $323. Presumably, you will be able to purchase these through certified Workspace resellers and hopefully, directly through Lenovo. We&#8217;ll reach out to our friends at Lenovo to see how soon we can get our hands on a review unit and put it through the paces. \n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Photo by Carmen Mandato/Getty Images\n    \n\n  2017 vs. 2022 Heading into 2017, the Minnesota Twins front office did very little to improve the on-field product. Coming off a 59-103 finish in ‘16, there was little reason to believe in a turnaround.\nSo of course, as baseball often goes, the ‘17 trade deadline saw the Twins battling for a playoff berth and The FALVINE (TM) struck a deal for Braves pitcher Jaime Garcia. He made one start—a victory!—but a disastrous West Coast road trip gave The FALVINE (TM) cold feet and they flipped him to the Yankees to become sellers at the deadline’s closing bell.\n  \n        \n      Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images\n      I’m actually a little surprised I was able to find a picture of Garcia’s blink-and-you’d-miss-it Twins tenure\n  \nFurther defying logic, the Twins went on an August/September tear to a Wild Card berth, where they had that glorious first-inning lead in the Bronx before, well, you know.\nDespite almost no effort in improving the team all season long, the 2017 Twins made an exciting go of it.\nContrast that with the current ‘22 campaign:\nFacing a clear lack of starting pitching quality and depth, The FALVINE (TM) onboarded Dylan Bundy, Chris Archer, &amp; Sonny Gray. They also made a logical (and analytically by-the-book) swap of Taylor Rogers for another SP—Chris Paddack—and a potentially decent reliever—Emilio Pagan—to boot!\nBeyond just hoarding SP’s, the biggest splash netted Carlos Correa in a move absolutely no one expected.\n  \n        \n      Photo by Brace Hemmelgarn/Getty Images\n      This was the biggest Twins “get” in quite some time (if ever)!\n  \nAfter four months of play, the Twins found themselves in an AL Central triumvirate with Cleveland &amp; Chicago and bullpen depth/quality was a clear bugaboo. Maybe one more playoff-caliber starter too. So, Tyler Mahle was acquired to accompany Sonny Gray &amp; Joe Ryan atop the rotation, while Jorge Lopez and Michael Fulmer were added to the pen.\nHow did that all pan out post-deadline? A 13-12 (pre-Boston finale) record—not exactly write-home material—and now behind the Guardians after spending most of the season in the driver’s seat.\nAll of this illustrates how cruel and unusual the much-discussed “Baseball Gods” can be. One Twins club does absolutely nothing and rises from the ashes to the playoffs. Another makes numerous additions all season long and has to fight tooth-and-nail.\nThe good news: No matter what the folks in business suits and blouses do (or don’t do), baseball turns on winning individual matchups—often on a pitch-by-pitch basis—not paperwork or projections. Things such as Pagan’s ability to locate his livewire fastball, solid (not wasteful) Max Kepler plate appearances, the hustle of Jake Cave, or the unique ability of Nick Gordon to inspire those around him.\n  \n        \n      Photo by David Berding/Getty Images\n      Not the tandem we expected, but the one we’ve got\n  \nAs the old saying goes, the chances of those things happening are 50/50: they either will or they won't. With back-to-school season imminent, no one else is coming to save this ball club at the bell. With the exception of a few potential injury returnees, its playoff fate will be decided almost exclusively by the current clubhouse crew.",

Residents of the tiny Finnish island where the novel is set are careful to avoid treading on the plant, and it is “only farmers and summer guests” who walk on it.This is because (“and it cannot be repeated too often”) moss is “terribly frail”. “Step on it once and it rises the next time it rains. The second time, it doesn’t rise back up. And the third time you step on moss, it dies.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "It might upset the wine aficionados, but experts are claiming the title across a growing number of industries, and many have years of training to back them up‘We thought we were being original,” says Andy Shovel, co-founder of the plant-based brand This. Having advertised for a meat “sommelier” to taste new products as part of a marketing campaign last year, Shovel was dismayed to hear that This was not the first company to co-opt the term, traditionally used to describe the person in charge of wine in a restaurant.In April, Subway recruited a crisp sandwich “sommelier” in collaboration with Walkers. Poppy O’Toole, a trained chef and the “Potato Queen” of TikTok, would visit the chain’s branches and advise customers on how to perfect their crisp and bread combinations, “imparting some of the flavour training and techniques from my Michelin training”, she said. Brewers, meanwhile, have had “beer sommeliers” for years, as those championing craft varieties sought to distinguish themselves from industrial-scale operations. As Sophie Atherton, the UK’s first accredited female beer sommelier, puts it: “Many of us are essentially ‘beer ambassadors’ – sharing our expertise, knowledge and enthusiasm to promote beer as a drink to be taken seriously.” The “sommelier” title has also spread to tea, honey, mustard, olive oil – even chocolate and oysters.

Now settled in Somerset, Devon and Cornwall, they have created a new foodie destinationIn Somerset, it has been a prolific summer for courgettes. I know this because they feature in at least three of the 10 dishes on the menu at the Old Pharmacy in Bruton. “We’re inundated,” says its chef patron, Merlin Labron-Johnson. I can’t decide between the tromboncino scapece – coins of a thin, curling, pastel-green courgette native to Italy, fried in garlicky olive oil then quick-pickled in vinegar, served cold as an antipasto – and a bigger dish of grilled chunks of yellow courgette with preserved lemon, courgette cream, nasturtiums and salty, lemony almonds. I order both.The Old Pharmacy’s blackboard menu is a snapshot of what is good and in season not just in the area, but at Labron-Johnson’s nearby farm, where he grows almost all of the fresh produce that this and Osip, his small, high-end restaurant next door, put to work in their kitchens. “We grow every vegetable, herb and fruit that it’s possible to grow in the UK,” he says, not least all those courgettes. “And we don’t need to look much further than Somerset for everything else – we have Westcombe for cheese, Bruton Organic Dairy for meat, and in winter we go to a local hunter for game.” The scapece arrives crowned with basil leaves and swimming in a golden pool of peppery olive oil; I order bread to mop it up, which arrives with a blob of freshly churned, salted butter.

        "description": "Photo by David Berding/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Tyler Duffey, Chi Chi González, and Jacob Barnes all signed minor league deals within the last 48 hours. In a surprising and under-the-radar set of moves, the Yankees signed Tyler Duffey, Chi Chi González, and Jacob Barnes to minor league contracts within the last 48 hours. What motivations could be behind the organization adding three right-handed pitchers with major league experience to the Triple-A roster? Let’s find out who these guys are and what they could possibly offer the Yankees.\nTyler Duffey\nDuffey spent the first eight years of his major league career with the Twins after they drafted him back in 2012. He was designated for assignment at the beginning of the month after pitching to a 4.91 ERA and 4.81 FIP with diminished strikeouts and elevated home run rates. He briefly signed with the Rangers on a minor league deal before opting out and joining the Yankees.\n\nDuffey was one of the best relievers in baseball between 2019 and 2020, placing seventh in K-BB% (28.2 percent) and xFIP (2.80) and 13th in fWAR (1.9) among qualified relievers. That’s far from the case this season, with the 31-year-old losing roughly a mph off his fastball velocity from his peak. As is the case when a pitcher loses velocity, the performance of his other pitches suffered. The command also took a step back, with his walk rate between 2021 and 2022 jumping almost four points relative to his previous career average while his first pitch strike rate sank to a career-low.\nGiven the somewhat tenuous health of the Yankees’ bullpen this season, it’s easy to see why they would want additional depth of relievers with major league high leverage experience in Triple-A. If Matt Blake can tease out even a portion of the effectiveness that made Duffey one of the most consistent setup men at the turn of the decade, he could be a valuable option waiting in the wings to reinforce the major league bullpen. \nChi Chi González\nGonzález started out with the Rangers his first two years in the bigs before moving over to the Rockies for three seasons. He bounced between the minors and majors with the Twins, Brewers, and Tigers this season before opting out of his minor league deal and landing with the Yankees. \n\nIt’s a little more difficult to see the fit here than with Duffey. Between 2015 and 2022, González was one of the worst starting pitchers in MLB, owner of the second-worst K-BB% (3.6 percent), third-worst ERA (5.93), fourth-worst xFIP (5.28), sixth-worst FIP (5.54), and ninth-worst fWAR (0.4) among starters with at least 200 innings pitched. He truly hit rock bottom last season, placing in the first percentile in strikeout rate, whiff rate, xBA, xSLG, xERA, and xwOBA. \nHe doesn’t throw particularly hard and his pitches don’t move all that much, but if you squint there are some intriguing aspects of his pitching profile. In recent years, he’s employed a fastball, cutter, slider mix like we’ve seen from many of the pitchers on the Yankees this year. This provides him a gradient of movement separation across the three pitches, which recent research suggests is optimal over an approach of maximizing separation in movement particularly on the horizontal plane. \nJacob Barnes\nBarnes is your typical journeyman reliever, having played for six different organizations in his six years in the bigs, with all those relocations happening over the last four years. He was quite effective his first three seasons with the Brewers, pitching to a 3.54 ERA (121 ERA+) and 3.55 FIP across 149 relief appearances totaling 147.1 innings. That effectiveness fell off the face of the Earth beginning in 2019, with Barnes the owner of a 6.48 ERA (68 ERA+) and 5.04 FIP, much of this due to the fact that he is allowing almost three times as many home runs per nine than in those first three seasons.\n\nAfter carrying a roughly league average strikeout rate for a reliever his first six years in the league, his punchouts cratered to the point that he’s barely striking out more people than he’s walking. He’s giving up the hardest average exit velocity of his career, although the exit velocity and groundball rates are some of the best marks of his career. \nI think Barnes is the most fascinating of the three pitchers the Yankees signed. His cutter exhibited the fifth-most horizontal movement versus average of any cutter in baseball in 2021. It’s actually bizarre that his slider is simply average in terms of sweep given the seam-shifted wake characteristics of both pitches, and I wonder if the Yankees could get more movement out of cutter and slider given the success with the cutter and whirly this year. In addition, his four-seamer was comfortably in the 90th percentile in vertical movement last year. Could he join Gerrit Cole and Nestor Cortes as the next high-spin rising fastball in the Yankees’ ranks?\nI still find myself asking what exactly these signings mean? What do their additions say about internal evaluations of the state of the bullpen? On the one hand, this could just be replenishing reliever depth in Triple-A of guys traded away like Waldichuk and Wesneski who might’ve been called up in September. On the other hand, given the injuries that have plagued the Yankees bullpen — Aroldis Chapman, Zack Britton, Michael King, Chad Green, Scott Effross, Miguel Castro, Stephen Ridings, and Albert Abreu are all currently on the IL — any of these three players could find a roll on the major league roster sooner rather than later. In addition, as the only one of the trio with starting experience, González could be used as an emergency or spot starter given the uncertainty surrounding Jameson Taillon’s forearm contusion (though Taillon did sound confident that he wouldn’t miss a start) and the lack of other viable starting options in the minors with Luis Gil out for the year with TJS and Deivi García only recently re-promoted to Triple-A.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe $20 million experiment, dubbed “Project Nexus,” is funded by the state of California and will assess whether solar panel canopies erected over exposed irrigation canal systems can significantly reduce water evaporation while simultaneously generating renewable power.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers from the University of California, Merced determined that covering the 4,000 miles of California’s open canals with solar panels could save upward of 63 billion gallons of water each year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study found the solar canopies could generate about 13 gigawatts of renewable power annually, the equivalent to about one-sixth of California’s installed capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA first-in-the-nation project to determine whether covering sections of canals with solar panels can help California reach its renewable energy goals is gearing up to break ground early next year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe $20 million experiment, dubbed Project Nexus, is funded by the state of California and will assess whether solar panel canopies erected over exposed irrigation canal systems can significantly reduce water evaporation while simultaneously generating renewable power. The project in California’s San Joaquin Valley is a partnership between utility company Turlock Irrigation District (TID), California’s Department of Water Resources (DWR), solar energy company Solar AquaGrid and the University of California, Merced. \n\n\n\nThe pilot project materialized following results published in a 2021 study outlining the potential benefits of the concept. While the idea is novel in the U.S., researchers looked at a large-scale, solar-canal system in Gujarat, India, and considered what the concept could do for California. \n\n\n\nResearchers from the University of California, Merced determined that covering the 4,000 miles of California’s open canals with solar panels could save upward of 63 billion gallons of water each year, the residential water needs of about 2 million people, or enough to irrigate about 50,000 acres of farmland. In terms of power generation, the study found the solar canopies could generate about 13 gigawatts of renewable power annually, the equivalent to about one-sixth of California’s installed capacity. That’s about half the projected new capacity needed by 2030 to meet the state’s decarbonization goals. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Another benefit is that it would avoid land use. Solar canopies over canals avoid the development of large tracts of land that would be required for ground-mounted systems. If we use canal infrastructure, that’s already disturbed land,” Brandi McKuin, lead author of the study and project scientist with UC Merced, said in an interview.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There’s a benefit to ecosystems and perhaps even it could avoid some of the protracted disputes over land use that other large utility scale solar projects have had to deal with, for example, tribal sovereignty,” McKuin added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother benefit is the microclimate of the canals can cool the solar panels and increase their efficiency. McKuin said field studies show solar canals in India cooled panels by as much as 10 degrees and had on average 3 percent higher output than ground mounted systems with the same configuration.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe shade from the panels could also limit light to aquatic weeds and reduce algae growth, which could result in big maintenance savings for entities that manage the canal systems.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor Project Nexus, less than 2 miles of irrigation canal operated by utility Turlock Irrigation District in California’s San Joaquin Valley will be covered with solar canopies. \n\n\n\nOne location in the town of Ceres involves covering about a mile straightaway of relatively narrow, 20 to 25 feet wide, canals and testing multiple different mounting technologies and solar panel designs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“At this site it’s going to be 8,000 linear feet of solar panels. So you’re going to have the ability to A-B test different hypotheses,” Josh Weimer, external affairs department manager for Turlock Irrigation District, said in an interview.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“So testing panels a little bit closer to the canal, some a little bit taller, and seeing if there is an efficiency difference. We’re also looking at potentially using two types of solar panels, mono-facial and bi-facial. With bi-facial you have the ability to potentially generate energy from the underside of the solar panel, and that might be a potential benefit if there’s some reflection from the water underneath the panel,” Weimer added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt the second location in the town of Hickman, just east of Modesto, a 500-foot stretch of canal that is 110 feet wide will also be covered using cable suspension. \n\n\n\nWeimer says the biggest hurdle is devising a viable and cost effective way to engineer the mounting techniques. There are also concerns about the canopies obstructing access to canals for maintenance.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe concept, if successful and scaled up, could potentially help California reach its climate goals and provide water and energy solutions to a state that has long suffered from severe drought. Weimer says using land the electric utility already owns for solar infrastructure could significantly cut costs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We have renewable energy requirements. We are going to need more and more renewables to meet our 2030 and 2045 goals. And so this could potentially be an option for us to scale up. We have 250 miles of canals. So we’re interested in studying this in a very small section,” Weimer said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGroundbreaking on the project is anticipated for early 2023, and the project is expected to be completed in 2024. ",

        "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) should improve its cybersecurity oversight of an important organ sharing network service and the nonprofit overseeing it, the inspector general's office overseeing the federal agency said Monday.\n\n\n\nThe report serves as a warning that data involving organ donors and receivers may not be adequately protected in the event of a security breach.\n\n\n\n\"Because of the critical role of the OPTN and the sensitive data it contains, a security breach could have significant consequences for vulnerable patients,\" the report reads, referring to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN).\n\n\n\nThe inspector general's office said in the new report that the department's Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) should develop additional oversight controls for the OPTN, which administers organ transplants and testing in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThat includes ensuring data on deliverable schedules, compliance assessments and monitoring is better protected in the information technology cyberspace.\n\n\n\nThe OPTN, known for its backlogs and tremendous wait times for patients seeking organs, has come under some scrutiny in recent months.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, the Senate Finance Committee released a report linking 70 deaths and more than 200 organ diseases to a lack of oversight from the OPTN. \n\n\n\nThe committee report detailed mistakes made with the organ network, including patients who received organs with the wrong blood type or organs that were tossed because of transportation failures.\n\n\n\nThe OPTN is overseen by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) on behalf of the federal government. A Washington Post report at the end of July revealed the nonprofit relies on out-of-date technology for the OPTN.\n\n\n\nThe inspector general's office launched its audit to determine if the HRSA properly oversaw cybersecurity oversight of the UNOS.\n\n\n\nAmong the findings were that the HRSA \"lacked adequate oversight procedures for UNOS to ensure that all federal cybersecurity requirements were being met in a timely and effective manner.\"\n\n\n\n\"A lack of finalized, written policies and procedures could result in essential cybersecurity controls not being implemented properly or at all,\" the report reads.",

        "description": "Bank of America has&nbsp;announced a new effort aimed at bolstering homeownership ​​opportunities in Black and Latino communities, with plans to offer zero down payment and zero closing cost mortgage options in certain neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nThe bank said the new options, announced this week, will be offered in Black and Latino neighborhoods in Charlotte, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles and Miami, as well other markets.\n\n\n\nBank of America says its effort, dubbed the Community Affordable Loan Solution, is targeted at helping “eligible individuals and families obtain an affordable loan to purchase a home.”\n\n\n\nAs part of the new rollout, the bank said the program will use “credit guidelines based on factors such as timely rent, utility bill, phone and auto insurance payments,” and will not require “mortgage insurance or minimum credit score.”\n\n\n\n“Individual eligibility is based on income and home location. Prospective buyers must complete a homebuyer certification course provided by select Bank of America and [Department of Housing and Urban Development] HUD-approved housing counseling partners prior to application,” the bank said.\n\n\n\nThe bank said the new effort will operate as a Special Purpose Credit Program. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, creditors can establish the programs under Equal Credit Opportunity Act to “meet the credit needs of specified classes of persons.”\n\n\n\nThe announcement follows years of data documenting glaring disparities in the housing market.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, a report released by the&nbsp;National Association of Realtors&nbsp;found the homeownership rate for Black Americans in 2020 was lower than it was a decade before, even as the nation’s overall homeownership rate saw a record annual increase.\n\n\n\nData&nbsp;from the Urban Institute also shows troubling racial differences in mortgage denial rates, with Black and Latino households bearing the brunt of the burden. According to the think tank, nearly a fourth of Black homebuyers were denied mortgages in 2020, along with 18 percent of Latino households.\n\n\n\nIn a statement accompanying the bank's recent announcement, AJ Barkley, head of neighborhood and community lending for the bank, discussed how homeownership, which advocates have described as a&nbsp;critical tool&nbsp;used to build wealth in America, can strengthen communities.\n\n\n\n\"Our Community Affordable Loan Solution will help make the dream of sustained homeownership attainable for more Black and Hispanic families, and it is part of our broader commitment to the communities that we serve,” Barkley said.",

        "description": "For state officials, opportunity has been knocking for years. Now it’s banging on their doors. \n\n\n\nThis is the opportunity to become leaders in the clean energy economy&nbsp;and reap&nbsp;its many benefits&nbsp;— whether it’s&nbsp;building&nbsp;innovative&nbsp;industries&nbsp;around clean technology&nbsp;and sustainable business,&nbsp;launching&nbsp;legions of&nbsp;well-paying&nbsp;jobs,&nbsp;improving&nbsp;air quality and&nbsp;public health&nbsp;or&nbsp;bringing&nbsp;energy cost-savings&nbsp;to&nbsp;businesses and households&nbsp;alike.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOver the last decade, several states have already moved to seize this chance. California, Washington, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Illinois and others are aggressively building out a clean energy economy through robust anti-pollution goals and clean energy investments that have put them at the forefront of U.S. climate policy. It’s been a vital demonstration of leadership on climate action, especially as the federal government languished for too long. But it has also been smart economic development policy, putting the states in prime position to support new industries and deliver for their residents and businesses. \n\n\n\nNow that the federal government has&nbsp;at last&nbsp;joined the party by passing the Inflation Reduction Act,&nbsp;state&nbsp;governments&nbsp;have every incentive to increase their&nbsp;own&nbsp;ambitions&nbsp;and&nbsp;leverage the financial and technical support&nbsp;offered by&nbsp;the historic package.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe IRA is a $370 billion national investment in everything from clean power energy and transmission lines to electric vehicle supply chains, innovative home appliances, new industrial processes and sustainable farming practices. How states respond to its passage will help determine whether we will meet our national climate goals — and whether the states themselves are leaving money on the table or positioning themselves to realize the biggest rewards of the shift to a clean energy economy. \n\n\n\nState&nbsp;policymakers&nbsp;are&nbsp;essential to&nbsp;ensuring&nbsp;the IRA meets its vast potential.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFirst, the new law includes a number of investments that the states must deploy themselves. These include billions of dollars for state-run programs to help consumers make energy efficiency improvements, strengthen conservation programs, establish clean energy and pollution reduction plans for rural and disadvantaged communities, and develop more ambitious standards to reduce pollution from buildings and technology. States owe it to themselves to accept and use these funds, and to ask for technical support to ensure the resources are deployed in the most effective, fair and forward-looking manner possible. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, many of the larger-scale investments in the IRA will require states’ help to facilitate their success. Governors, state legislatures, utility regulators, and other policymakers must establish a policy environment that harnesses the federal law. This will include making prudent decisions about permitting, siting and energy resources that allow projects to move forward quickly but equitably, while signaling to industry that their state is open for business.  \n\n\n\nFinally,&nbsp;states must take up the mantle of the IRA. While the&nbsp;IRA&nbsp;is expected to help the U.S. achieve a 40 percent reduction in climate pollution by 2030,&nbsp;it does not fully meet the national goal of 50 percent. Making up the difference will&nbsp;require&nbsp;more action&nbsp;at all levels of government.&nbsp;And&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;new&nbsp;federal investments creating even stronger tailwinds,&nbsp;leading states now have plenty of reason to&nbsp;increase their ambition even more. States that&nbsp;have&nbsp;lagged&nbsp;behind&nbsp;can&nbsp;now&nbsp;confidently move to make up ground&nbsp;by adopting&nbsp;strong climate&nbsp;targets&nbsp;and clean energy&nbsp;policies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis work isn't just&nbsp;about&nbsp;growing&nbsp;the clean energy industry. Increasingly, businesses across all sectors want to invest in&nbsp;places&nbsp;that make it easier to access clean energy and&nbsp;zero-emissions transportation&nbsp;options, so they can&nbsp;meet their own climate goals and control their costs.&nbsp;That’s why so many&nbsp;companies&nbsp;fought for and supported the IRA&nbsp;— more than 2,900&nbsp;businesses of all sizes,&nbsp;representing every industry&nbsp;and&nbsp;totaling&nbsp;more than 400 million&nbsp;global employees, advocated for the package of federal investments —&nbsp;and why&nbsp;they&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;push&nbsp;for strong state policies across the U.S.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGiven&nbsp;the polarization of&nbsp;politics&nbsp;over&nbsp;the last decade,&nbsp;it may be hard to imagine some states taking&nbsp;strong climate&nbsp;action today.&nbsp;But&nbsp;economic growth is a bipartisan&nbsp;goal.&nbsp;As the IRA takes hold&nbsp;and its&nbsp;investments&nbsp;surge across the country, it will be&nbsp;far&nbsp;more difficult to&nbsp;imagine&nbsp;states&nbsp;failing to capitalize on&nbsp;what promises to be&nbsp;one of the most game-changing and innovative industrial&nbsp;periods in U.S. history.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlli Gold Roberts is the senior director of state policy at the sustainability nonprofit Ceres.&nbsp;",

Officials are begging residents to conserve electricity in an effort to prevent outages. \nThe state is now in its second day of a “Flex Alert” issued by the state’s power grid operator, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO). Under the Flex Alert, Californians are urged to voluntarily curb their electricity use between 4PM and 9PM. That’s the time of day when the grid is under the most pressure because it’s when power demand typically rises as people come home from work, and there’s less solar energy available as the sun sets.\nOfficials are begging residents to conserve electricity\nCutting down on energy use...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

It’s also collaborated with other projector makers, including this obscure UST model from last year.\nThe announcement was light on details, so my colleague Jon Porter chased down a demonstration of an early Cine 1 prototype at the Leica booth.

        "description": "Charles C.W. Cooke: &#8220;It is increasingly tempting to ignore these outbursts of constitutionally illiterate election-trutherism as a distraction. Certainly, if one wishes to, one can write them off as a mere sideshow — as the detached and irrelevant ravings of an unemployed septuagenarian has-been. At this point, one might say, Trump is just another Crazy Uncle with a social-media account. And, besides, instead of parsing what he says on the Internet, shouldn’t we be focused on the FBI’s continuing self-abasement, which occasioned the flare-up in the first instance?&#8221;\n&#8220;But the thing is: None of that is really true, is it? Donald Trump has been talking like this for 18 months now. He is not some Crazy Uncle; he is the most likely person to be the next Republican nominee for president — and, for that matter, the next president. And while I strongly agree that the FBI needs wholesale reform — if not outright abolition — that does not change the fact that what Trump is saying in response on his failing social-media platform is nuts.&#8221;",

        "description": "Written by Carla R. Chamberlin for Bucks County Women&#8217;s Advocacy Coalition\n\n\n\nIf you have not been in a classroom recently, you might not recognize all of the learning activities and tools, but you would be reassured by the dedication, energy, and expertise of the teachers. Although teaching resources have expanded immeasurably (if not equitably), the social climate of teaching has become more constrained and challenging. We face local and global crises that today’s young people must confront with exceptional knowledge, skills, and passion. Yet many school districts here in Bucks County and around the nation are taking steps to inhibit learning by banning certain subjects and mistrusting the professional integrity of educators.\n\n\n\nAs of summer 2022, educational gag orders that prevent teachers from talking about “divisive concepts” in classrooms (from K-12 through university level) have become policy in 19 states, and over 70 bills in 28 states propose to ban, for example, topics that might make students feel uncomfortable and the presentation of historical facts that might show the United States in a negative light. In Pennsylvania, the proposed HB 1532 and SB-1278 bills place restrictions on free speech in higher education and K-12, respectively. At local and national levels, school districts have implemented polices that censor materials referring to race, LGBTQ issues, rights and activism, gender identity, or have people of color as lead or prominent characters. Pennsylvania, in fact, ranks second in the nation for the number of books banned in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n.@PennridgeSD Proposed Policy on Student Expression Is ‘Extreme’ &amp; ‘Unconstitutional’ | “It violates the First Amendment protections guaranteed to students &amp; the case law that has interpreted that right,” said @edlawcenterpa Maura McInerney. #BucksCountyhttps://t.co/6xG0NPDBgs&mdash; BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) August 12, 2022\n\n\n\n\nThese policies affect all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese policies affect all students, all teachers, and all community members. They forbid teachers from engaging students in critical thinking about the world around them. One rationale behind these legislative efforts is the premise of protecting students’ comfort by not allowing any debate or controversy to surface in the classroom. Another justification is to protect students from information about diverse identities. Students will be exposed to diversity anyway (both online and off); these policies just ensure that students won’t be able to talk about anything in a safe space with adult guidance. These limitations prohibit discussion of important content and diminish opportunities to develop skills of inquiry, research, evaluation, debate, and intercultural communication. These pieces of legislation assume that our young people are incapable of thinking for themselves and that educators hold a secret power to indoctrinate or “groom” them. Teachers’ roles are to facilitate students’ engagement with and questioning of the information they will encounter both in and beyond the classroom. Students need more opportunities to engage productively with controversial issues, not fewer. Knowledge, skills, and passion should not be replaced by misinformation and disengagement. This version of education mirrors social media, not reality.\n\n\n\nREAD: Right-Wing Politics And Moral Panic Driving Policy Targeting Central Bucks School District Libraries\n\n\n\nIn our media-saturated worlds, we are bombarded by information that is decontextualized and simplified in order to attract attention and tap into deep emotional responses. Producers of click-bait and propaganda are not trying to encourage inquiry and reflection. They want impulsive, pre-programmed reactions, whether it be for entertainment, selling products, or selling ideologies. Classrooms, on the other hand, need to reflect the complexities, diversity, and nuances of reality. They should be the places where information is analyzed, interrogated, evaluated and contextualized. Classrooms can show our young people how to talk and listen to each other and develop positive social and leadership skills. What’s happening in our school districts concerns all of us because, right now, our schools are producing our fellow citizens of tomorrow. Our communities cannot flourish if future citizens are not prepared to have productive conversations about issues that affect everyone.\n\n\n\nWhat You Can Do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin us on Wednesday, September 7, from 1:30-2:15 p.m. on Zoom&nbsp;for the BCWAC series,&nbsp;Keeping It Brief. Our guest will be Dr. Carla Chamberlin discussing the importance of high-quality public education systems for all members of a community.\n\n\n\nREGISTER TODAY\n\n\n\nVisit the PEN America website (pen.org)&nbsp;for more information and updates on legislation about education across the country.\n\n\n\nVisit your school district’s website to learn more about your school board members, proposals, and actions. What happens in our local school boards and state legislatures impacts all of us.\n\n\n\nCarla R. Chamberlin, Ph.D., The Pennsylvania State University, Abington College and individual partner of the Coalition",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sept. 7, the Miami-Dade School Board will vote on whether it should recognize October as LGBTQ History Month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the meeting, the school board will also determine if teachers should be allowed to instruct two landmark supreme court cases, one of which granted the right to same-sex marriage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLGBTQ+ advocacy groups are showing support for the school board’s measure.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs students return to the classroom this month, Florida schools are working out how to abide by the state’s “Parental Rights in Education” law, otherwise known as “Don’t Say Gay” bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs a result, the Miami-Dade School Board plans to vote next week on whether it will recognize October as LGBTQ History Month. The school board recognized LGBTQ History Month last year for the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Teaching LGBTQ history fosters a welcoming school climate where LGBTQ students, families, and educators can live their authentic lives and be treated with dignity and respect,” wrote MDSB school board member Lucia Baez-Geller in an action proposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The District appreciates and recognizes the importance of LGBTQ History Month as an effective means of educating and calling to action our community to work together by fighting prejudice and discrimination in their own lives and increasing visibility and raising awareness,” Baez-Geller added.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring the Sept. 7 meeting, the school board members will also decide if teachers should be able to use two landmark supreme court cases in 12th-grade social studies classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe first case, Obergefell v. Hodges, granted the right to same-sex marriage and the second, Bostock v. Clayton Country, prohibits an employer from discriminating against a worker because they are gay or transgender.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrism, a South Florida-based nonprofit that works to expand access to LGBT-inclusive education materials and sexual health resources, started an online petition in support of the school board recognizing October as LGBTQ History Month.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“In light of the harmful anti-LGBTQ laws passed this year, it is abundantly clear that MDCPS must remain steadfast in supporting and affirming all students,” the petition on Change.org reads.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The recognition of LGBTQ History Month promotes education about the historical impacts, achievements, and contributions of our lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community.\"&nbsp;",

        "description": "The IRS is back.\n\n\n\nOver a decade of painful budget cuts and expanded responsibilities has left the tax-collecting agency barely able to perform its most basic duties, but help is on the way. President Biden recently signed into law the&nbsp;Inflation Reduction Act of 2022&nbsp;(IRA), which allocates $80 billion in additional funding to the IRS, with over half designated explicitly for tax compliance enforcement.\n\n\n\nThe bill’s $45 billion for enforcement is desperately needed. For years, America’s most affluent have used intentionally complex practices to shield their wealth, under the (correct) assumption that the IRS didn’t have the resources to follow their elusive money trails.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith the passage of the IRA, the IRS will finally have the funding to go after these wealthy tax cheats. But even with this new funding, the IRS may not have the leadership it needs to accomplish Biden’s goals.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf President Biden wants the IRA to be a success, he needs to replace the current commissioner of the IRS, Chuck Rettig.\n\n\n\nRettig, appointed by President Trump in 2018, has since proven himself unwilling to identify and punish wealthy tax evaders. Under his leadership, rather than completing audits on the rich, the IRS audited workers making less than $25,000&nbsp;five times more often than all other filers. Rettig’s IRS audited the poorest Americans who used the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)&nbsp;at a higher rate&nbsp;than every other tax bracket, save for the absolute wealthiest Americans. They even&nbsp;reduced&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;millionaires audited to 13,725 in 2021, just a third of the amount 10 years ago.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe decline of audits on the rich isn’t entirely Rettig’s fault. Over the last 10 years, a&nbsp;20 percent funding cut&nbsp;left the IRS lacking investigators with the expertise required to go after rich people and their complicated finances, making audits of the richest of the rich more difficult to pursue widely. But the choice to audit working people at a considerably higher rate instead of going after the worst and the wealthiest tax cheats was just that, a choice.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen has&nbsp;already directed&nbsp;the IRS to use this increased funding exclusively on taxing rich Americans. Still, even with such a directive, the day-to-day administration of $45 billion is incredibly significant. Since the head of the IRS can assign large amounts of funds at their discretion, only a commissioner committed to taxing the rich can utilize this new funding effectively. Rettig has proven himself untrustworthy of that role.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRettig has a history of shady dealings since before he even began his job under Donald Trump. He spent 40 years of his career&nbsp;working for a law firm&nbsp;specializing in helping rich clients avoid paying taxes. He&nbsp;omitted information&nbsp;about his ownership of Trump-branded real estate during his appointment. He&nbsp;publicly&nbsp;defended the former president’s withholding of his tax returns, going as far as&nbsp;obstructing the congressional subpoena&nbsp;asking for the tax return’s release. Under Rettig, Trump-opposed former FBI director and deputy director, James Comey and Andrew McCabe, were both selected for a rare type of tax&nbsp;audit. The likelihood of both these men, known to dislike Rettig’s appointment, being audited coincidentally is virtually impossible. Rettig’s career reeks of corruption at every turn.\n\n\n\nRettig, as commissioner, is a banner advertising that the department is not on the side of ordinary Americans. He must be removed from his position if we want to progress towards adequately funding tax enforcement on the Americans who need it the most — the ultra-wealthy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSince&nbsp;Republicans are already jumping to attack this new funding&nbsp;as an additional tax burden on ordinary Americans, it’s especially crucial for Democrats that the IRS uses this money to go after only tax evasion by the wealthiest offenders. It is critical, both politically and economically, that this extra enforcement money is used effectively and specifically to tax the rich and not to maintain the status quo by increasing the audits of poor people further than it already has.\n\n\n\nChuck Rettig has overseen an environment of devaluing and discouraging tax enforcement on the wealthy by the IRS and cannot be the man to oversee a complete overhaul of the agency. If Biden and Democrats want to tackle wealthy people evading taxes like they say they do, they need an IRS commissioner that is on their side, not a Trump appointee who’s shown he has no interest in holding the richest accountable for paying their fair share.\n\n\n\nDrew Pomerance is a co-founding partner of the law firm Roxborough, Pomerance, Nye &amp; Adreani and a member of the Patriotic&nbsp;Millionaires.&nbsp;",

        "description": "House Republicans on Thursday asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to hand over communications between Facebook and the FBI related to the platform's reduced distribution of a New York Post story on Hunter Biden. \n\n\n\nZuckerberg previously told podcaster Joe Rogan last week that the social media platform limited the New York Post story’s appearance on news feeds ahead of the 2020 presidential election while it was being fact checked. \n\n\n\nThe limitation, Zuckerberg said, came in response to warnings from the FBI about disinformation and potentially polarizing content.\n\n\n\n“We have seen in recent months how some in government have sought to use Big Tech to censor divergent viewpoints and silence opposing political speech,” the 35 Republican lawmakers wrote to Zuckerberg in a letter.\n\n\n\n“Facebook’s suppression of the Post article—and allegations of Biden family corruption highly relevant to the 2020 presidential election—following guidance from the FBI is highly troubling,” the House Republicans wrote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShortly before the 2020 election, the Post published a story that the FBI had obtained a laptop that allegedly belonged to President Biden's son as part of a federal investigation. \n\n\n\nThe House Republicans argued that the reduced distribution of the Post article from Facebook prevented “Americans from fully understanding highly relevant allegations about President Biden’s awareness of and involvement in his family’s influence-peddling scheme.\"\n\n\n\nAmong the signatures on the new letter are the top Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee and the House Judiciary Committee, Reps. James Comer (Ky.) and Jim Jordan (Ohio) respectively. \n\n\n\nThe lawmakers have requested all communications between Facebook and the FBI about the Post article, purported election misinformation and Facebook's plans to act on the FBI's warnings, as well as any communications between Facebook and Biden's presidential campaign about the Post reporting.\n\n\n\nSens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) addressed a similar letter to Zuckerberg on Monday, citing the Meta CEO's comments on Rogan’s podcast.  \n\n\n\nThe senators argued that news and social media outlets “inappropriately rushed to censor and discredit the initial reporting and falsely labeled it as ‘disinformation.’”\n\n\n\nThe senators requested related records and contended that “the American people deserve to know whether the FBI used Facebook as part of their alleged plan to discredit information about Hunter Biden.”\n\n\n\nFollowing Zuckerberg's comments on the podcast, the FBI has stated that the agency “routinely notifies” companies about potential threats in the wake of Russia's meddling on social media platforms ahead of the 2016 election. \n\n\n\n“None of this is new. Mark testified before the Senate nearly two years ago that in the lead up to the 2020 election, the FBI warned about the threat of foreign hack and leak operations,” Meta posted on Twitter last week after Zuckerberg’s podcast appearance.",

With him as active roster limits expand from 26 to 28 is Miguel Vargas, one of the club’s top hitting prospect, recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City for his second stint in the majors.\nKershaw last started on August 4 in San Francisco, exactly four weeks ago. He was sidelined this time with low back pain, after missing 29 days in May and June with inflammation in his right SI joint.\nThe timing of his return, with five weeks remaining in the regular season, leaves time for around six starts to get ready for the postseason, the first of those coming in the series finale Thursday afternoon against the Mets.\nVargas made his major league debut on August 3 in San Francisco, driving in two runs with a double and a single. He played two games in his first big league time before getting sent back down to Triple-A.\nThe 22-year-old has excelled in the Pacific Coast League this season, but especially so since his demotion. He hit .375/.518/.594 with eight doubles, two home runs, more walks (17) than strikeouts (12), helping him to score 19 runs in 19 games.\nOn the season, Vargas hit .304/.404/.511 with Oklahoma City, a 129 wRC+ with 17 home runs, and led the league with 133 hits, 32 doubles, and 100 runs scored. Vargas also ranked among the top five in the PCL in RBI (82), walks (71), extra-base hits (53), total bases (224), on-base percentage, and OPS (.915).",

I live in a building right next to one of the hotels being used to house the asylum seekers (Park West Hotel on Central Park West between 106th and 107th).\nI had met one of the families while on a walk with my dog and they expressed a need for clothing. I quickly ran up to my apartment and threw together some snacks, toiletries, and clothes that they could have.\nAfter hearing about all that they needed, my neighbor, Rachel Nelson, and I reached out to friends and family asking for donations and very quickly got $1,000. We then went to TJ Maxx and Target to get clothing, toiletries, snacks, and even games for the kids staying there. I’ve attached photos of all that we were able to provide them.\nI think a lot of New Yorkers are looking for ways to help, and what these people need is EVERYTHING. The biggest ask has been clothing and shoes, though.\nWe brought the [things] directly to the hotel. They have a room [where] they’re collecting all of the donations. I’m sure other hotels will accept too.\nThank you,\nEmily",

        "description": "Photo by Todd Kirkland/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Welcome to the new injury recovery controversy, same as the old injury recovery controversy.  It’s been a relatively stressful few days when it comes to this year’s version of the Atlanta Braves — after all, they just got done breaking only their second three-game losing streak of the year and did so in pretty stressful fashion after Kenley Jansen made a shaky save to preserve the victory. I’m not particularly worried about Jansen since basically every Dodgers fan that I know made sure to warn me in the offseason that he was going to have days like this. Now that he’s finally Having Days Like This, it’s something to expect and I also believe that we should expect that Kenley Jansen will get it back on the right track — after all, he did pick up the save last night. Sometimes it’s best to not argue with results!\nIt’s also been pretty stressful for Ronald Acuña Jr. in general. This is also another thing that everybody should’ve seen coming, including myself. Maybe I was far too optimistic about Acuña being a medical marvel who could return from a knee injury and hit the ground running without having any complications down the road. Even with the advancements in health and medicine that have been made, serious knee injuries are still very difficult to get over! \nWe’ve seen that with the way that Acuña and the Braves have been trying their best to manage the situation as the Venezuelan dynamo attempts to return to form. I’d say that they’re doing a pretty good job being as careful as hey have been so far. As good of a player as Acuña is, it’s better to make sure he gets some rest during the regular season than having to worry about potentially breaking down once October rolls around. \nWith all of that being said, boy did we take a rollercoaster ride with Ronald Acuña Jr. and his knee last night! So, let’s start with the peak of the rollercoaster, which was watching Acuña absolutely pulverize a baseball for a solo homer that ended up being the winning run in last night’s contest. Any time you send a ball flying 444 feet, you know you’re having a good time that is not at all terrible in the least bit. Acuña may only have 11 home runs this season but when he gets ‘em, he’s been absolutely tagging them. \n\nWhile everybody was riding high following the victory, the rollercoaster then went back into its valley when Ronald Acuña Jr. made this comment about his knee while taking questions from reporters following the game:\n\n\n#Braves' Ronald Acuña Jr. on the status of his knee: “It’s terrible. We’re just going to play through it until the season’s over.”— David O'Brien (@DOBrienATL) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nYikes! That does sound terrible! When you take a look at that quote by just reading it on paper (or on your screen if you want to be literal about it), it definitely seems like it’s one of those things that a dude should absolutely not be playing through until the season’s over. Again, just taking a look at that quote by itself would have you thinking that this is basically the nightmare scenario when it comes to Acuña and his ongoing recovery from his knee injury and surgery. \nWith that being said, this is one case where the eye test of seeing someone in action or something in motion should far outweight simply reading something. Context matters and let me tell you: the video of Acuña making those comments about his knee provides a ton of context about how he and the Braves may actually feel about his knee right now. \n\n\nRonald Acuña Jr. provides an update on his knee a couple hours after hitting a 444-foot home run   pic.twitter.com/Snr2Qh3PUt— Bally Sports: Braves (@BravesOnBally) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nMaybe you could wave that off as a nervous laugh to try to make light of the situation but just like I saw Acuña kind of laugh off the situation as he was talking about it, I also saw him send a ball to the daggone moon just hours before he made this statement. Instead of the takeaway being “Oh no, his knee is ruined and he’s never going to be the same again,” I’d figure that this should be a situation where you say “Good grief, he hit a ball 444 feet while his knee feels terrible? Just imagine what he’s going to do when he’s finally 100 percent healthy again?”\nIf anything, this reminds me of the time a few years ago when Freddie Freeman returned from getting his wrist broken by a pitch and talked after a game about how his wrist was still bothering him. In fact, Freeman himself said that it felt like he was at the plate swinging a “wet newspaper” at the time. I remember it vividly because I logged on and threw a fit about it on this very blog site. I’m saying that now to say that it’s probably best to not panic in this situation. While Freeman’s injury situation was different since he was still gutting through what turned out to be the final year of the mini-rebuild and Ronald Acuña Jr. figures to be an important part of a Postseason contender, the point is that we should probably trust the player and the team to know what’s best in this situation.\nFreddie Freeman ended up finishing that 2017 season on a relatively strong note and I’d imagine that it’s hard to complain about this current version of Ronald Acuña Jr. when he’s still producing at a 119 wRC+ clip for the season. It’s easy and actually pretty understandable to panic about Acuña’s knee but again, I’d imagine that everybody with close knowledge of how he’s feeling would tell you that he’ll be able to get through this season and then come back better once he’s had a another offseason to get his footing back, so to speak. If Acuña’s willing to gut it through in order to help this team retain the World Series title then we should have faith that he’ll be about to help this team as the season hits the home stretch.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/orioles-jesus-aguilar-dl-hall-september-callup-dfa-richie-martin.html",
        "description": "The Orioles announced another series of roster moves Thursday, selecting the contract of first baseman Jesus Aguilar (whom they signed to a minor league deal yesterday), recalling top pitching prospect DL Hall from Triple-A Norfolk and designating infielder Richie Martin for assignment.\nAn All-Star when he hit 35 home runs for the 2018 Brewers, the now-32-year-old Aguilar was with the Marlins from 2020 up until a couple weeks ago, when Miami designated him for assignment and released him. Aguilar was a solid middle-of-the-order bat for the Fish in 2020-21 but has stumbled to a .236/.286/.388 batting line through 456 plate appearances this season &#8212; including a dismal .188/.246/.347 output since the All-Star break.\nUgly as those numbers are, Aguilar hit a combined .262/.338/.476 in just shy of 2000 plate appearances from 2017-21, so there&#8217;s a track record of solid productivity in his bat. The O&#8217;s will hope that he can return to form and provide a boost to a lineup that has struggled to score runs of late. If Aguilar can indeed recapture that form, he&#8217;ll help to replace the production of Trey Mancini, whom the Orioles shipped to Houston at the trade deadline despite being within striking distance of a Wild Card berth. Mancini hit .268/.347/.404 in 401 plate appearances this year prior to being traded.\nHall, the No. 21 overall pick back in 2017, made his big league debut earlier in 2022 but was tagged for five runs in 3 2/3 innings that day. He&#8217;s had an uneven season in the minors this year, pitching to a combined 4.48 ERA with a huge 36.6% strikeout rate but an ugly 13.4% walk rate in 84 1/3 innings between one start in High-A, one in Double-A and another 22 appearances (18 starts) in Triple-A.\nThose shaky numbers notwithstanding, Hall still ranks among the game&#8217;s top 100 prospects due to a fastball that reaches triple digits and a collection of offspeed pitches that all have the potential to be plus offerings. This year&#8217;s 13.4% walk rate is an exact match with his career mark in the minors, however, which underscores the ongoing location issues he&#8217;s battled throughout his time as a professional.\nMartin, 27, was the top pick in the 2018 Rule 5 Draft. A former first-rounder of the Athletics, Baltimore pounced on the opportunity to add him to the organization and hoped he could eventually carve out a role on the big league club. That hasn&#8217;t happened yet, however, as Martin floundered through a rookie season in which he couldn&#8217;t be optioned due to his Rule 5 status, hitting .208/.260/.322 in 2019. He&#8217;s only had 138 Major League plate appearances during that time, due in no small part to a fluke pair of broken wrists &#8212; both his left and his right &#8212; which obviously led to considerable time on the injured list.\nOverall, Martin is a .212/.261/.311 hitter in 447 Major League plate appearances, and his .234/.333/.349 slash in 390 trips to the plate at the Triple-A level aren&#8217;t all that much better. It&#8217;s fair to wonder whether his development would&#8217;ve turned out differently were it not for that pair of fractures, but as a 27-year-old former prospect on a team that&#8217;s looking to turn the corner and emerge from a years-long rebuilding effort, Martin&#8217;s place on the 40-man roster has increasingly looked to be on shaky ground. He&#8217;ll be placed on outright waivers or released within a week&#8217;s time, as he&#8217;s ineligible to be traded at this point in the season.",

        "description": "The Dodgers announced Thursday that left-hander Clayton Kershaw has been reinstated from the 15-day injured list and infield prospect Miguel Vargas has been recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City. That pair represents the team&#8217;s initial September call-ups, though it&#8217;s not the only pair of moves made today. Los Angeles also placed right-hander Brusdar Graterol on the 15-day injured list due to inflammation in his right elbow. Fellow righty Phil Bickford is up from Oklahoma City to take his spot on the roster.\nKershaw wound up missing just under a month of action after being placed on the injured list due to a lower back injury. He&#8217;ll step back into the rotation and look to continue what has been yet another largely successful campaign when healthy; in 85 1/3 innings this season, Kershaw carries a 2.64 ERA with a sharp 26.2% strikeout rate against a tiny 4.5% walk rate. He&#8217;ll join the recently activated Dustin May, Julio Urias, Andrew Heaney and Tyler Anderson in a Dodgers rotation that is currently missing Walker Buehler (Tommy John surgery) and Tony Gonsolin (forearm strain).\nFor Graterol, it&#8217;ll be a quick return to the injured list. The 24-year-old flamethrower was out from July 14 through Aug. 22 due to a shoulder injury and will now be placed back on the shelf for a yet-to-be-determined period of time. He&#8217;s been an integral part of a Dodgers relief corps that has been frequently beset by injuries in 2022, contributing 44 2/3 innings of 3.02 ERA ball with a 22.2% strikeout rate, 5.7% walk rate and massive 62.9% ground-ball rate. The Dodger bullpen has remained strong even amid myriad injury troubles, however, and they&#8217;re expected to reinstate Blake Treinen, who&#8217;s been out since late April, as soon as tomorrow, which should help to soften the blow of losing Graterol.\nThis is the second Major League stint of the season for the 22-year-old Vargas, who&#8217;s widely considered to be among the game&#8217;s 50 or so top prospects. He&#8217;s had a big year in the upper minors, hitting .304/.404/.511 in 520 plate appearances at the Triple-A level. Bickford, 27, has a 5.14 ERA in 49 innings of bullpen work with the Dodgers this season.",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The team has embraced being fun and turned Citi Field into the place to be. When Steve Cohen first purchased the Mets, a certain somebody wrote that the changing of the guard at the top of the organization could represent a complete identity change for the New York Mets. The Wilpons had their hands in so many facets of the team that simply removing them and installing somebody else in their position could change everything we knew about the lame, annoying, boring Mets.\nUnfortunately, the first year of Cohen’s ownership didn’t exactly live up to that promise. It was a turbulent season all around. Whether it was due to members of the old guard still holding leadership positions in parts of the organization, the lack of time to implement new processes in just one offseason, the weirdness of the first year coming off the pandemic, or some unspoken agreement to lay low in Cohen’s first year and not completely blow up the free agent economy, the 2021 season felt like far too close to a Wilpon year for comfort.\nBut this year, that identity change has finally occurred. The Mets are finally something different now. The way they decided to build the team on the field was one thing—the strategy of “sign the best players at positions of need and build an elite team” is unquestionably not the typical Mets’ offseason plan—but they’ve gone so far beyond just being a great team this year. \nThis team is fun. This team has a personality. They’ve made coming to the ballpark every night an experience. I don’t mean just on the field, either, where a bunch of entertaining and ebullient All-Stars perform a brand of baseball so competent and satisfying that you have to double take to make sure you are, indeed, watching New York Mets—but off the field as well. As a younger fan, people of my generation hear stories about the excitement surrounding the team in the 1980s and how “Shea Stadium was the place to be” in those times, and we just have to take people’s word for it. We had never witnessed a Mets team like that captured the city like those teams did. But now, in 2022, we’re getting a taste of what it truly means when Queens feels like the “cool” place to be. \nLast night felt the perfect example of that. A raucous, near-sellout crowd was in attendance to see an elite team play behind the best pitcher in baseball, and the night was highlighted with an incredible live performance by Timmy Trumpet blaring “Narco” as Edwin Díaz trotted to the mound in a moment that perfectly blended baseball and music. It was an entrance fit for WrestleMania. It was unique, it was cool, and it was so, incredibly fun. \nThe Mets have made Diaz’s entrance one of the staples of the Citi Field experience, with a dramatic blackout of all of the new LED screens in the park before the first beats of “Narco” hit, trumpet giveaways, and Mr. and Mrs. Met having their own dance routine to it. But the way the team has thrown its arms around the “Narco” craze is just one thing they’ve done; they’ve really been trying fun stuff like this all season long to improve the in-game experience. They have smoke machines for when the team emerges from the dugout to take the field in the first inning, which is a type of “rah rah” entrance usually only done in football. They tried a “Blackout The Park Night,” which is something that would’ve looked really cool if it worked. The in-between inning antics have become much more entertaining and sometimes poke fun at the opponents. They even invited Shakira to come and hang out with the team. And, perhaps most importantly, they’re finally honoring their own history.\nUnder previous ownership, the Mets ranged anywhere from ambivalent to flat out embarrassed by their own history. Citi Field infamously opened with nearly no Mets history acknowledged, and in the years since former players were almost never honored unless they had won a World Series with the team or went into the Hall of Fame as a Met. They never followed through on the Seaver statue until it was too late, they waited eight years to even retire Mike Piazza’s number, and fans were rarely rewarded for caring about Mets history and following the team for years.\nNot anymore. Just this year alone, the Mets have unveiled a Tom Seaver statue, retired Keith Hernandez’s number, invited Johan Santana back to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of his no-hitter, held their first Old Timers’ Day in nearly 30 years, and kept a 50-year promise to Willie Mays to retire his number 24. They did what they could last year to honor the past more as well, retiring Jerry Koosman’s number and inducting Ron Darling, Edgardo Alfonzo, and John Matlack into the Mets Hall of Fame. \nThey’ve embraced the multi-generational impact of players across the 60 years of Mets baseball, and not just players who played for the 1986 or 1969 teams, either. The Mets finally acknowledge that other teams matter. The 2006 Mets matter. The 1999 Mets matter. The 2015 Mets matter. The 1962 Mets matter.\nIt’s so easy to make baseball fun and rewarding for fans, and the Mets have finally done that. This is how it’s supposed to be. This team is fun, and going to a Mets game is fun. It must be, because they’ve drawn tremendous crowds all summer long; their average attendance of 33,978 fans per game would be the third-most in Citi Field history behind 2009 and 2016. People want to come out and see the Mets again, and it’s because they’ve made themselves must-watch TV every night and made going to Citi Field a great night out. This is truly baseball like it oughta be.",

        "description": "DL Hall is back. He’s going to be a reliever this time. | Photo by Douglas P. DeFelice/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Unlike the old days, you only get two extra roster spots in September now. It’s September 1, and that means that baseball rosters have expanded. Not too long ago, this meant teams could call up as many players as they wanted from their 40-man roster, but this has been curtailed in recent years so that teams can only add two players to the roster. The Orioles made their moves on Thursday afternoon, recalling pitching prospect DL Hall from Norfolk and selecting the contract of veteran 1B/DH Jesús Aguilar.\nThe 32-year-old Aguilar only arrived in the Orioles organization on a minor league contract earlier this week, so if you didn’t even know he was around, that’s why. Aguilar never even reported to Norfolk. The Orioles just had him join the team in Cleveland, knowing they would activate him today. Aguilar was released by the Marlins on August 27 after a season in which he’d batted .236/.286/.388 over 113 games.\nSeeing that poor performance for this season, an obvious question presents itself: Why? Aguilar adds no positional flexibility. He is another right-handed bat in the mix, but if he’s not hitting, that’s not worth much. \nPresumably, the Orioles are hoping that Aguilar can find something of the form that allowed him to have a .794 OPS over the two previous seasons with the Marlins, or even his 35 home runs from back in 2018. I expect him to perform like Rougned Odor, without having been annoying us with that level of performance all year before now. If he does better than this, I’ll be pleasantly surprised.\nOf interest to those who care about uniform number trivia, Aguilar is going to wear #99 as an Oriole. That’s what he’d been wearing with the Marlins this year. No Oriole has ever worn a number higher than #88 in the regular season before. So he’s going to hold at least one distinction, no matter what else happens.\nHall’s return is much more exciting. We’ve known since he debuted in mid-August that the Orioles were going to work on Hall as a reliever for the remainder of the season, with the goal of rejoining the team exactly today. Here we are, and here he is. In four relief outings since going back down to Norfolk, Hall has held batters to a .087 average. \nCommand issues are still there. Hall walked three men in two innings in his first relief outing. I don’t know what to expect from him, but if nothing else I’d rather see him get some garbage-time innings than pitchers like Rico Garcia or Louis Head.\nAguilar was not on the 40-man roster before today, necessitating a corresponding move from the Orioles. They designated infielder Richie Martin for assignment. With Joey Ortiz added to the infield mix in Norfolk, it seemed like only a matter of time before Martin would be sent packing. He never hit in the majors, or in Norfolk either. Elias’s first Rule 5 draft pick has been passed over on the depth chart by other players long before now.",

        "description": "Sleep age, a projected age that correlates to your health based on sleep quality, could predict your mortality, scientists say.\nFor instance, if you analyze the sleep characteristics of dozens of 55-year-olds and average them out, you&#8217;ll have an idea of what sleep looks like at that age. For instance, someone who&#8217;s 55 and sleeps soundly through the night with good quality REM cycles could, theoretically, have a sleep age of 45.\nFor a new study in npj Digital Medicine, Emmanuel Mignot, professor in sleep medicine at Stanford University Medicine, and his colleagues analyzed some 12,000 studies, each of which focused on an individual, that reported characteristics of their sleep—such as chin and leg movement, breathing, and heartbeat. Their goal was to develop a system that assigns one&#8217;s sleep age and, using machine learning, identify the variations in sleep most closely linked to mortality.\nGenerally speaking, people sleep differently at different ages, with changes in sleep quality being one of the first and most well-documented signs of aging and poor health. The good news: Sleep age isn&#8217;t set in stone. We have the power to improve it.\nHere, Mignot talks about why sleep age is important, how it&#8217;s calculated, and what the study&#8217;s findings imply about our health:\nThe post Your &#8216;sleep age&#8217; may predict your mortality appeared first on Futurity.",

The USB Promoter Group says that USB 4 version 2.0 will be capable of speeds up to 80 Gbps, double what the original USB 4, and even Thunderbolt 4, are capable of. \nThe actual technical specification from the USB Implementers Forum, which is in charge of the standard itself, hasn’t been released yet, but the details coming out today are a little stunning. The Promoter Group writes in a press release that USB 4 version 2.0 cables will use the USB-C connector, which is to be expected, but the real bombshell is this line: “Key characteristics of the updated USB4 solution include: Up to 80 Gbps operation, based on a new physical layer architecture, using existing...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

Last month, Micron said it would use the act’s new subsidies to invest $40 billion into US-based memory fabs, or fabrication plants, by 2030, creating an estimated 40,000 new jobs. The new Boise plant is expected to create 17,000 new jobs, including 2,000 Micron jobs, over the next eight years. \n“In our future, we will make EVs, chips, fiber optics, and other critical...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "Photo by John Cordes/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  September callups bring an 80-grade mustache back to Kansas City It’s September 1, which means that rosters are expanding. The Royals have taken advantage of that immediately, recalling 29-year-old journeyman Daniel Mengden and his 80-grade mustache. He’ll make his first start of the season tonight and his Major League start in over two seasons.\nAlong with Mengden, Nate Eaton is also reportedly back in Kansas City\n\n\nNate Eaton has a locker in the #Royals clubhouse this morning.— Anne Rogers (@anne__rogers) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Royals have historically used this final month of the season to their advantage, often at the cost of draft slots. On September 1, 2011, Kansas City was slotted at pick #3, which turned into Mike Zunino. They finished at #5 and took Kyle Zimmer. On September 1, 2009, the Royals were due to have the #2 overall pick, which turned into Jameson Taillon, but was immediately followed by Manny Machado. A hot September dropped Kansas City to #4, where they took World Series hero Christian Colon. The 2008 squad started September at #5 and a hot September dropped them to #12. Zack Wheeler, Mike Minor, and Mike Leake went in those slots. The Royals got Aaron Crow. \nAside from Machado, none of these are dramatic misses. In fact, the most ill-timed hot September came back in 2018, when the stakes were Adley Rutschman and Bobby Witt Jr. Luckily, Baltimore were so bad in September that a bad September from Kansas City probably wouldn’t have given them a fighting chance at Rutschman anyway. And Kansas City had an 8.5 game lead for #2 entering September, so the wins never really risked their chance at coming away with Witt Jr either. So all was well.\nThe 2023 class isn’t very top heavy and lacks slam dunk prospects like Rutschman and Witt Jr, so it appears that there isn’t a lot to lose for. So hopefully we’ll get a good dose of guys like Eaton and a decidedly smaller dose of guys like Hunter Dozier and Ryan O’Hearn, but somehow I doubt that happens. \nMengden will take the mound opposite of former Royals and current horse enthusiast Johnny Cueto, who is in the midst of a career revitalization in his age-36 season. Cueto entered 2022 with a 4.38 ERA since 2017 and having not made more than 25 starts since 2016. His only full season during that span came in 2020, when he made 12 starts in the pandemic-shortened seasons and posted a 5.40 ERA for the Giants. \nDuring that span, he posted a 4.5 rWAR in 394.1 innings. In 123.2 innings this season, he’s been worth 3.6 rWAR, his best season since 2016. \nFor the Royals, Brent Rooker replaces Hunter Dozier today as the DH. For the White Sox, Elvis Andrus leads off for just the second time all season and Chicago is still without manager Tony La’Russa, who is reportedly out indefinitely with undisclosed health issues.\n\n\nFollowing a medical evaluation this morning, Chicago White Sox Manager Tony La Russa now is scheduled over the coming days to undergo additional testing in Arizona by his personal physicians. His absence from the club will be indefinite pending the results of these evaluations.— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) August 31, 2022\n\n\n\nHere are your lineups for this afternoon’s game. \n\n\nHere's how we're taking the field behind Daniel Mengden in the deciding game of our series vs. the White Sox.#TogetherRoyal pic.twitter.com/WeajKAMiFZ— Kansas City Royals (@Royals) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nToday's #WhiteSox starters at Guaranteed Rate Field.⏰: 1:10 p.m. CT : @YouTube  : @ESPN1000  : @FDSportsbook  : CWS to have most hits -145 pic.twitter.com/duUXNKCvlj— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 1, 2022",

        "title": "The very real dangers of Biden’s pending Iran nuclear deal",
        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3620724-the-very-real-dangers-of-bidens-pending-iran-nuclear-deal/",
        "description": "With a renewed nuclear deal reportedly imminent, the Biden administration has touted its hard-nosed negotiating tactics forcing Iran to accept that its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) will remain on the State Department’s list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations. While that’s technically accurate, the real question is what practical effect any new deal might have on IRGC finances and whether they would benefit from the $100 billion a year in sanctions relief likely to also be part of a renewed agreement.\n\n\n\nMost people think of the IRGC as a military and terrorist organization, but in reality, they control a significant percentage of Iran’s everyday economy. In 2010, Iran expert Meir Javedanfar said, “A conservative estimate would be to say that the IRGC now controls at least half of [Iranian] government-owned companies.” Alireza Nader of Rand Corporation has noted, “The Revolutionary Guards is the key economic player in Iran and control(s) Iran’s official and illicit economy.” Indeed, their investments include domestic construction and infrastructure, energy production, medical surgeries, food, education, transportation and, of course, military infrastructure.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere is little difference between the Iranian government under the control of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, his heir apparent, President Ebrahim Raisi, and the Revolutionary Guards. They are intertwined. According to Reuters, the IRGC is a more than 125,000-strong military force, “is also an industrial empire with political clout, and is loyal to the supreme leader.” BBC reported that the IRGC’s Khatam al-Anbia Construction Company “control(s) around a third of Iran’s economy through a series of subsidiaries and trusts” worth an estimated $100 billion. Western distinctions in negotiations between the IRGC and the Iranian government are artificial and misleading, undermining our strategic goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD),&nbsp; “The Biden administration’s decision to keep the IRGC on the Foreign Terrorist Organizations list now looks like a legal sleight of hand and not like a principled defense of that designation. If reports are true, the Biden team has agreed to gut IRGC sanctions and allow tens of billions of dollars to flow to terrorists actively plotting to murder even more Americans.” His colleague, Richard Goldberg, added, “Either President Biden believes the IRGC is a terrorist organization, or he doesn’t. If this were ISIS or al Qaeda, would anyone be offering sanctions relief to their top financiers or negotiating how foreigners could do business with their affiliates?”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSecondary sanctions penalize countries and entities that deal with and profit from trade with a sanctioned organization. The 2015 nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) bypassed restrictions on the IRGC by removing sanctions on whole segments of the Iranian economy controlled by the organization. According to the FDD experts, in a new agreement the “full enforcement of U.S. secondary sanctions against IRGC affiliates will be lifted … with additional terrorism-sanctions relief for the IRGC’s top financiers, including the Central Bank of Iran and the National Iranian Oil Company.”\n\n\n\nThe Central Bank of Iran (CBI) has a history of subterfuge, hiding and transferring funds for the IRGC to support its terrorist networks in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. This has included circumventing sanctions on oil exports and covering up the true source of transactions. With a new deal, sanctions against the CBI reportedly will be lifted, allowing it to more easily cover the financial tracks of the Revolutionary Guards.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf you expect the Biden administration to enforce secondary sanctions against the IRGC after a new Iran deal comes about, then you also may believe that the JCPOA will permanently end Iran’s ability to develop atomic weapons and that the moon is made of green cheese. As it was with President Obama, non-nuclear-related sanctions for terrorism, human rights abuses and missile proliferation will be minimally enforced so as not to rock the boat, by displaying Iran’s defiance.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bottom line is that Iran’s hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief will benefit the IRGC and its malign activities. The Foreign Terrorist Organizations designation is more for show than effect, since there will be no secondary sanctions on businesses that have one degree of separation from the IRGC. The organization’s prosperity provides the financial resources needed to support proxies such as Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Iranian-controlled Popular Mobilization Units.\n\n\n\nCan Congress do anything to stop the financial enrichment of the IRGC in the Biden administration’s new nuclear deal? No. By law, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, sanctions relief must be reviewed by Congress. There is little doubt that all Republicans will vote against lifting sanctions and almost all Democrats will support it. Even if a majority of Congress were to vote against sanctions relief in a renewed deal, Biden would veto that decision.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDefenders of this deal claim it is better than no deal, because at least there will be some temporary restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program. They point to North Korea, noting there are no agreements or hope for reining in a fanatical regime.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, this bad deal with Iran will not be better than having no deal. Providing financial support for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps will feed the regime’s appetite for expansionism and terrorism, increasing the potential for a regional war. In a few years, any nuclear restrictions will expire, and a Middle East nuclear arms race inevitably will follow. How would any of this advance America’s national security interests?\n\n\n\nDr. Eric R. Mandel is the director of MEPIN, the Middle East Political Information Network.

        "description": "The Johnny Cueto Sox fans hope to see today. | Jason Miller/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Two-game winning streak is a possibility! But just on YouTube. Really. While their manager left a city full of world-class hospitals and doctors to seek medical help elsewhere, the White Sox managed to actually win a game Wednesday night, upping their record in an August that was supposed to be the softest part of the schedule to 13-16. \nThat victory, given it was a game the White Sox were highly expected to win, didn’t impress the computers much, though. The Big Three predictors — FanGraphs, PECOTA and 538 — each give the Sox about a 5% chance of winning the awful AAAL Central, and about 10% to make the playoffs at all.\nBut it’s a new month, and the Sox have Johnny Cueto on the mound to try to start September right. Cueto and his 2.98 ERA and 3.6 WAR are about the only thing that’s kept Rick Hahn’s past year from being a total disaster. \nCueto had a terrible outing against the lowly Diamondbacks last time out, getting tagged for seven runs in five innings, but that’s the only time all season he’s given up more than three earned runs, so there’s good reason to believe it was a one-off. Sox fans sure hope so, because pitchers with last names beginning with C have been about the only pleasant upside surprises this year.\nOn the mound for the Royals, who somehow have won the season series with the Sox this year despite beating almost no one else, will be 29-year-old righty Daniel Mengden, who took the journey part of journeyman seriously and played in Korea last year. Mengden, who has had multiple surgeries on his arm and innards, is a September call-up, having pitched only four innings with the Royals this year and the rest of the season in Omaha, where he wasn’t any more impressive than he had been in past major league seasons (Matt Foster and Adam Haseley are Chicago’s September call-ups).\nOh, and the injured Luis Robert is off for paternity leave, and despite getting a free (non-40 man roster) replacement while he is off (less than a week, we’re told), the White Sox feel they have sufficient outfield depth to whether his absence. To be fair, Robert has essentially been absent for a week already while nursing his wrist back to health (the IL does not cost money to use, White Sox!), so they’re well-versed in hamstringing their roster.\nThe Royals having their Triple-A farm in Omaha leads to the question of whether their minor leaguers go to bed dreaming of the old Roger Miller refrain, “I’m the king of Kansas City, no thanks, Omaha, thanks lots.” But I digress.\nMengden will be facing a White Sox lineup that includes Leury García, presumably in a tribute by interim manager Miguel Cairo to the absent HOFBP.\n  \n        \n  \nCueto takes on a Kansas City lineup in which only Salvador Pérez and Michael Taylor have more than four at-bats against him, Taylor with four K’s in six trips, so there’s not much history to go on.\n  \n        \n  \nFirst pitch is set for 1:10 p,m, Central on a hot afternoon, game time temp 86° and what tiny breeze there is heading toward left. In the continuing spirit of MLB doing everything possible to alienate fans, the only video coverage is on YouTube. \nBut at least if you get bored and/or angry, you can switch to a few million videos of kittens and puppies.",

        "description": "Photo by Harry How/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Phil Bickford was recalled from Triple-A The Dodgers will be without reliever Brusdar Graterol for at least two weeks, as the right-hander was placed on the 15-day injured list Thursday with inflammation in his right elbow.\nThat injury adds further context as to why Graterol wasn’t available to pitch in Tuesday’s series opener against the Mets. The Dodgers had five relievers unavailable for that game, four of whom pitched at least the night before. Graterol last pitched Sunday in Miami.\n\n\n#Dodgers Brusdar Graterol said he felt his elbow bothering him during his last outing against the Marlins. He’s going to get an MRI tomorrow, which will determine how long he’ll be sidelined.— Juan Toribio (@juanctoribio) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nBrusdar Graterol said he’s getting an MRI tomorrow. Didn’t want to speculate on whether he feels he can be back this year until after that. Said he felt some more pain in his elbow today after trying to throw a bullpen session yesterday. Has bothered him since his last outing.— Fabian Ardaya (@FabianArdaya) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nGraterol also missed six weeks with right shoulder inflammation, returning just ten days ago. He pitched in four games in between injured list stints.\nGraterol has a 3.02 ERA and 3.12 FIP in 41 games this season, with 39 strikeouts and 10 walks in 44⅔ innings. He’s allowed earned runs in just one of his last 19 appearances.\nThe Dodgers made the Graterol move retroactive to Wednesday, which means his earliest return date is September 15.\n\nPhil Bickford was recalled from Triple-A, just two days after getting optioned. Bickford has a 5.14 ERA and 4.43 FIP in 51 games, with 49 strikeouts and 13 walks in 49 innings. He’s allowed a team-bullpen-high nine home runs.\nThe Dodgers are also expected to make a corresponding roster move once they are back home Friday, with Blake Treinen activated after missing 4½ months on the injured list.",

        "description": "Billy Hamilton, doing the thing. | Photo by Joe Robbins/Getty Images\n    \n\n  “Southpaws and speed” - the new slogan of life. Major League Baseball teams must expand their rosters to 28 players today, and the Minnesota Twins are no exception. They have added a pitcher and a speedy position player to their roster in hopes of bettering their chances of snatching a playoff berth this season.\nAs mentioned yesterday, the Twins added southpaw Austin Davis to their 40-man roster and is now officially on the active roster. Davis was claimed off waivers from the Boston Red Sox yesterday and added to the 40-man roster thanks to the DFA of utilityman Tim Becham. Davis owns a career 5.49 ERA/4.47 FIP in five seasons, pitching for the Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, and the Red Sox. He will serve as some left-handed depth in the bullpen alongside Caleb Thielbar and Jovani Moran.\nMinnesota is adding some late-game defense and speed on their bench with the addition of outfielder Billy Hamilton. The speedster was signed by the team one week ago and played in two games with Triple-A St Paul, batting 1-for-7 with a double, a walk, and a stolen base. He saw limited action with the Miami Marlins this year, batting .077/.143/.077. However, the bat is not the main focus - it’s his speed and defense. Hamilton has 321 career stolen bases against being caught 71 times. He will certainly factor into close games for the Twins down the stretch. \nCan both players be on the Twins’ playoff roster? Technically any player in the organization prior to September 1 is eligible to be on the playoff roster. Davis can be added easily as he was on the team’s 40-man roster prior to this month. Hamilton can still join the playoff roster but will need to take the place of an injured player and also get approval from the league. However, the process is pure formality and is generally approved. \nTo make room for Hamilton, the Twins have moved outfielder Trevor Larnach to the 60-day Injured List. Larnach has missed almost 60 games already this season, so the move makes sense to open a spot for another player. The Twins still hope to have Larnach back before the end of the season.",

        "description": "Photo by Todd Kirkland/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Atlanta adds a pair of players to the active roster as part of September roster expansion.  As the calendar flips to September, that brings roster expansion to Major League Baseball. The process looks a little different than it did a few years ago when teams were allowed to promote up to 40 players. Teams are now allowed to expand back to 28 players with a limit of 14 pitchers. As a result, the Atlanta Braves announced Thursday that they have added reliever Jesse Chavez and infielder Orlando Arcia to the active roster.\n\n\nThe club also returned RHP Mike Soroka from his rehabilitation assignment, reinstated him from the injured list and optioned him to Triple-A Gwinnett. To make room on the 40-man roster, Atlanta transferred RHP Darren O’Day to the 60-day IL.— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Braves claimed Chavez off of waivers from the Angels on Tuesday marking the second time this season that they have acquired him. Chavez played a key roll for Atlanta on their way to winning the World Series last season. He signed with the Cubs during the offseason, but was traded back to Atlanta on April 20 in exchange for Sean Newcomb. He appeared in 31 games for Atlanta while posting a 2.11 ERA and a 2.55 FIP in 38 1/3 innings. Chavez was then sent to the Angels, along with Tucker Davidson, in the trade that brought back Raisel Iglesias at the deadline. Chavez struggled while with Los Angeles allowing 15 hits and nine runs in 10 2/3 innings with the Angels. His return gives the Braves another multi-inning option that can fill a variety of roles out of the bullpen. \nArcia suffered a hamstring injury back on August 9 and recently began a rehab assignment at Gwinnett where he was 3-for-13 at the plate with six strikeouts. \nThe Braves also returned Mike Soroka from his rehab assignment and optioned him back to Gwinnett. That is more of a procedural move than anything and he will continue to build back up with the Stripers. It will be interesting to see if he returns to the major league level at any point this season or if the Braves choose to just let him finish out the season in the minors. To make room on the 40-man roster, Atlanta transferred Darren O’Day to the 60-day injured list.",

        "description": "Warnings of grave impacts on children’s health from energy price rises should prompt anger as well as practical supportAdding to existing worries about the cost of living, the implications of the latest report from the Institute of Health Equity are deeply alarming. Its author, Prof Michael Marmot, spells out the links between rising fuel poverty and various forms of illness, and warns that the threat is greatest for those who are already least well-off. By January next year, 55% of UK households, or 15 million, are expected to be fuel-poor (though a change in the way this is officially defined in England, and differences with Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, make comparisons difficult).Warnings of surging demand at food banks, and a backdrop of acute concern about the growing gap between incomes and prices, make the picture drawn by the report all the bleaker. It predicts worsening respiratory and mental health for children in affected homes, and highlights the increased circulation of viruses and infections, including bronchiolitis, associated with colder temperatures. The contribution of damp and mould to asthma is also pointed out. So are links between poverty, cold, poor housing and mental illness. Continue reading...",

        "description": "The singer talks about moving home, his upbeat new sound, the euphoria of performing and putting out a ‘sunny New Zealand record’Get our weekend culture and lifestyle emailIt’s appropriate that Marlon Williams is chilling in a rocking chair when we talk. The only furniture more suited to his heady and breezy third solo album, My Boy, would be a hammock. The title track is a perfect indication: a good-times radio hit, or “Māori disco bop” as Williams puts it, set to guitar played in Māori strum style (also known as jingajik, jungajuka and dumdejak, from which you no doubt get the idea). It’s a welcome salve after a few stagnant years, in which he – like most musicians – could not tour his last release. What’s more, it feels like a huge-hearted album.“That makes me very happy,” Williams says, when I say so. “I wanted it to be concerned and loving, and keep the arms of the record open. I can’t help but write dark songs most of the time, so I set up the world around me to make sure I kept it upbeat.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Continue reading...",

        "description": "Men who take in high rates of ultra-processed foods are at 29% higher risk for developing colorectal cancer than men who eat much smaller amounts, research finds.\nThe study did not find the same association in women.\nColorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed cancer in the United States.\n&#8220;We started out thinking that colorectal cancer could be the cancer most impacted by diet compared to other cancer types,&#8221; says Lu Wang, a postdoctoral fellow at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, and lead author of the study in The BMJ.\n&#8220;Processed meats, most of which fall into the category of ultra-processed foods, are a strong risk factor for colorectal cancer. Ultra-processed foods are also high in added sugars and low in fiber, which contribute to weight gain and obesity, and obesity is an established risk factor for colorectal cancer.&#8221;\nThe study analyzed responses from over 200,000 participants—159,907 women and 46,341 men—across three large prospective studies which assessed dietary intake and took place over more than 25 years. Researchers provided each participant with a food frequency questionnaire every four years and asked about the frequency of consumption of roughly 130 foods.\nResearchers then classified participants&#8217; intake of ultra-processed foods into quintiles, ranging in value from the lowest consumption to the highest. Those in the highest quintile were identified as being the most at risk for developing colorectal cancer. Although there was a clear link identified for men, particularly in cases of colorectal cancer in the distal colon, the study did not find an overall increased risk for women who ate higher amounts of ultra-processed foods.\nSausage, bacon, and fish cakes\nThe analyses revealed differences in the ways that men and women consume ultra-processed foods and the prospective associated cancer risk. Out of the 206,000 participants followed for more than 25 years, the research team documented 1,294 cases of colorectal cancer among men, and 1,922 cases among women.\nThe team found the strongest association between colorectal cancer and ultra-processed foods among men come from the meat, poultry, or fish-based, ready-to-eat products.\n&#8220;These products include some processed meats like sausages, bacon, ham, and fish cakes. This is consistent with our hypothesis,&#8221; Wang says.\nThe team also found higher consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, like soda, fruit-based beverages, and sugary milk-based beverages, is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer in men. However, not all ultra-processed foods are equally harmful with regard to colorectal cancer risk.\n&#8220;We found an inverse association between ultra-processed dairy foods like yogurt and colorectal cancer risk among women,&#8221; says co-senior author Fang Fang Zhang, a cancer epidemiologist and interim chair of the division of nutrition epidemiology and data science at the Friedman School.\nOverall, there was not a link between ultra-processed food consumption and colorectal cancer risk among women. It&#8217;s possible that the composition of the ultra-processed foods consumed by women could be different than that from men.\n&#8220;Foods like yogurt can potentially counteract the harmful impacts of other types of ultra-processed foods in women,&#8221; Zhang says.\n&#8220;Further research will need to determine whether there is a true sex difference in the associations, or if null findings in women in this study were merely due to chance or some other uncontrolled confounding factors in women that mitigated the association,&#8221; says Mingyang Song, assistant professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and co-senior author of the study.\nAlthough ultra-processed foods are often associated with poor diet quality, there could be factors beyond the poor diet quality of ultra-processed foods that affect the risk of developing colorectal cancer.\nThe potential role of food additives in altering gut microbiota, promoting inflammation, and contaminants formed during food processing or migrated from food packaging may all promote cancer development, Zhang notes.\nDecades of data\nWith more than a 90% follow-up rate from each of the three studies, the research team had ample data to process and review.\n&#8220;Cancer takes years or even decades to develop, and from our epidemiological studies, we have shown the potential latency effect—it takes years to see an effect for certain exposure on cancer risk,&#8221; says Song. &#8220;Because of this lengthy process, it&#8217;s important to have long-term exposure to data to better evaluate cancer risk.&#8221;\nThe studies included:\n\nThe Nurses&#8217; Health Study (1986-2014): 121,700 registered female nurses between the ages of 30 and 55\nThe Nurses&#8217; Health Study II (1991-2015): 116,429 female nurses between the ages of 25 and 42\nThe Health Professional Follow-up Study (1986-2014): 51,529 male health professionals between the ages of 40 and 75.\n\nAfter an exclusionary process for past diagnoses or incomplete surveys, the researchers were left with prospective data from 159,907 women from both NHS studies and 46,341 men.\nThe team adjusted for potential confounding factors such as race, family history of cancer, history of endoscopy, physical activity hours per week, smoking status, total alcohol intake, and total caloric intake, regular aspirin use, and menopausal status.\nZhang is aware that since the participants in these studies all worked in the healthcare field, the findings for this population may not be the same as they would be for the general population, since the participants may be more inclined to eat healthier and lean away from ultra-processed foods. The data may also be skewed because processing has changed over the past two decades.\n&#8220;But we are comparing within that population those who consume higher amounts versus lower amounts,&#8221; Zhang says. &#8220;So those comparisons are valid.&#8221;\nReducing colorectal cancer burden\nWang and Zhang previously published a study that identified a trend in increased ultra-processed food consumption in US children and adolescents. Both studies underscore the idea that many different groups of people may be dependent on ultra-processed foods in their daily diets.\n&#8220;Much of the dependence on these foods can come down to factors like food access and convenience,&#8221; says Zhang, who is also a member of the Tufts Institute for Global Obesity Research.\n&#8220;Chemically processing foods can aid in extending shelf life, but many processed foods are less healthy than unprocessed alternatives. We need to make consumers aware of the risks associated with consuming unhealthy foods in quantity and make the healthier options easier to choose instead.&#8221;\nWang knows that change won&#8217;t happen overnight, and hopes that this study, among others, will contribute to changes in dietary regulations and recommendations.\n&#8220;Long-term change will require a multi-step approach,&#8221; Wang adds. &#8220;Researchers continue to examine how nutrition-related policies, dietary recommendations, and recipe and formula changes, coupled with other healthy lifestyle habits, can improve overall health and reduce cancer burden. It will be important for us to continue to study the link between cancer and diet, as well as the potential interventions to improve outcomes.\nThe National Institutes of Health&#8217;s National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, the National Cancer Institute, and the American Cancer Society funded the work.\nThe content is solely the authors&#8217; responsibility and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.\nSource: Tufts University\nThe post Ultra-processed food linked to men&#8217;s colorectal cancer risk appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Jay Biggerstaff-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Yankees’ reliever has found consistency with his release point and extension, and everything else is coming together. It’s fair to say that the 2022 season hasn’t gone the way Jonathan Loáisiga or the Yankees would have wanted, at least in general. He has, before Wednesday’s game, an elevated 5.29 ERA in 32.1 frames filled with inconsistency, control issues, and a problematic shoulder injury that sidelined him for around two months.\nThis is a far cry of the 2.17-ERA pitcher he was in 2021 across 70.2 innings, if we judge him by the raw numbers. That hurler finished with a 2.4-fWAR season last year, and looked like one of the best and most consistent relievers in the American League. However, every pitcher has highs and lows over the course of a full season — that’s why it’s always useful to analyze Loáisiga’s performance before the injured list stint and after returning.\nUpon returning to the active roster on July 14th, Loáisiga immediately allowed three runs. After that, he has pitched 18 games and 15 innings, giving up just three earned runs for a 1.80 ERA. He has conceded just 10 hits and five walks, with 11 punchouts.\nThings are looking up for him as we get closer to the postseason: during his last seven games, he has a 1.35 ERA with a 0.60 WHIP and seven strikeouts in 6.2 innings. In his last 15 games, the right-hander has posted a 1.50 ERA in 12 frames, with a 0.92 WHIP and nine punchouts. \nHe is sporting a 53.6 percent groundball rate (GB%) in the month of August, and while the strikeouts are still not all the way back yet, they are starting to return (again, check his numbers in his last seven appearances). At long last, he is showing signs that he is rounding into form at the most opportunistic time.\nBack in May, our own Esteban Rivera analyzed what was going on with Loáisiga, and he made two noteworthy conclusions: his command was gone, and his sinker was getting hit a lot. He was having issues finding a consistent release point (especially with his sinker), and that significantly affected him results-wise. You could say that the two primary weapons that fueled his 2021 breakout weren’t there.\nSince returning from his stint on the shelf, however, he has made considerable strides in that area. Here are his release points in a game on April 17th against the Baltimore Orioles, in which he was battered:\n  \n        \n  \nYou could see his sinker’s release point is all over the place. Now, let’s take a look at Lo’s game against the Oakland Athletics on Tuesday:\n  \n        \n  \nIt looks better, and the results seem to suggest that.\nFor a pitcher like Loáisiga, the sinker is the key that will open all doors. He throws it over 60 percent of the time, so it’s important that the pitch has the right velocity, horizontal, and vertical movement. Extension, however, is also crucial.\nAfter returning from the IL, he has been throwing the sinker more in the zone. It also has more horizontal and vertical movement, but the horizontal and vertical release point and release extension all appear to be back at similar levels than last year. In April and May, the pitch was breaking at the wrong time as a result of his difficulties and inconsistencies, but that no longer seems to be the case.\nHere is his average release extension by month, illustrating his improvement in the area (it is back to last year’s levels after being significantly down in April and May).\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \nFixing his release point has helped him get that deadly late break with his pitches, especially his sinker:\n\nIn addition to improving (and finding consistency with) his sinker, command, and release point — all are tied together — he also added more lateral sweep to his slider to create a different movement profile compared to his sinker, as Peter Brody wrote.\nAll things considered, Loáisiga’s sinker and slider look a lot better, his command has improved, and he has been more consistent. With each passing day, he is looking more and more like the pitcher that took the league by storm in 2021, and that’s excellent news for the Yankees and bad news for the rest of the league.",

        "description": "A viral video starring an adorable child has briefly united the world in shared understanding: “It’s corn!”The child, whose first name is Tariq and whose last name is unknown, but who also goes by “CEO of Corn,” appeared in a video on a popular Instagram account called Recess Therapy. (Recess Therapy is a man-on-the-street-style interview show on which all the guests are children.) Tariq is missing a front tooth, so he’s approximately whatever age at which that typically happens. He’s in a park in Brooklyn, and he is eating corn on the cob. “Ever since I was told that corn was real, it tasted good,” he explains. His grandmother is cracking up in the background. “I can’t imagine a more beautiful thing,” he says, of corn.The video’s host, Recess Therapy creator Julian Shapiro-Barnum, asks him to describe corn to someone who has never heard of it. “A big lump with knobs,” he obliges. Not how you would describe it, is it? Kids say the darndest things! At the end of the video, Tariq asks that everyone watching have a “corntastic day” and then behaves as if baffled by the host’s open-mouthed laugh. “What?” he asks. “It’s just a pun about corn.”[Read: How quickly can a girl go viral on TikTok?]Of course people love this video. There are many ways in which it is funny. The word corn, for starters, has a certain inherent comedic tone. Tariq’s syntax is strange, as he is a child. Corn Kid went viral on TikTok and Instagram, and it was boosted by the digital-media company Doing Things Media, which co-created Recess Therapy and is known for its involvement with several popular meme accounts. (On its website, Doing Things Media describes itself as “a 24/7 dopamine drip machine.”) Soon after, the original video was remixed by a group of people who do that sort of thing, resulting in a remarkably catchy song that features outtakes from Tariq’s interview not included in the original clip. (“When there’s, like, negative in the world, take a corn break.”)Tariq’s viral fame proceeded in a pretty predictable fashion. He appeared in a Chipotle ad and started selling personalized video messages on Cameo starting at $220. Social-media commentators championed this at first. “Get this little boy paid,” one Twitter thread with thousands of retweets insisted. “If he makes the right moves he can work with the Green Giant or any other corn company.” But this encouragement came with caveats. Later in the same thread, the author expressed concern about Tariq’s opportunity for profit going too far: “Please don’t make this little boy do anything he doesn’t want to do … parents get so swooped up in trying to get their kids ‘set’ for life but just relax.” In the replies, others agreed and worried that Tariq was not being properly guided by his parents, arguing that they must “have no idea what they’re doing.”[Read: Memes are becoming harder to monetize]Others pulled Corn Kid into broader narratives about the internet and exploitation. “Watching the corn kid get put into every ad on the planet and instantly become a lifeless and joyless aspect of the capitalist machine is not fun,” one tweet read. “Childhood virality is wild this kid was just eating a snack in public and now his parents are letting people/businesses book him on cameo,” read another, which has been retweeted thousands of times. Many of Corn Kid’s volunteer advocates assumed that he was being taken advantage of by whoever was profiting off of his image.This is an understandable reaction—a fear response created by years of observing similar viral events. Black children and teenagers, especially, have historically been cut out of any potential profits that may come from the internet cultural events they create. In a now-classic essay published by The Fader in 2015, Doreen St. Félix argued that brands had made a habit of viewing Black young people’s “cultural production” as “ripe for the taking.”When a person receives a lot of the internet’s attention and brands inevitably start circling, it is obvious to us now how things can easily go wrong. If the person is a child, onlookers worry this will cause lasting damage and be weird for them for the rest of their lives. All kinds of dark outcomes feel not only possible but probable. For instance, Joshua Holz and Daniel Lara, the teenagers who starred in the classic 2016 Vine clip “Damn Daniel,” received a lot of free sneakers, appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, were profiled in magazines, and suffered a lot of bizarre consequences. I wrote about them wistfully in 2018: “They found prom dates. Fell in love. Drank Red Bull with mom … Also, their accounts were hacked, and Josh was swatted after a stranger lied to the police, saying he had shot his mother with an AK-47.”So far, Tariq’s story hasn’t taken any of the dark turns internet-culture observers have come to expect. According to Shapiro-Barnum, Tariq and his family are getting a cut of the profits from the musical remix, and Recess Therapy is protecting Tariq’s identity by not sharing his last name. He has not been doing interviews or television appearances, and his family declined to comment for this story. Shapiro-Barnum is conscientious about how his work may affect the children he interviews and removes any content that a parent ultimately decides against having online. He has so far been acting as an intermediary of sorts for Tariq and says that he forwards every media or brand request he receives to Tariq’s mom: “I want to give them the reins.”Although the song has been copy-pasted all over TikTok and is impossible to fully control or exert ownership over, Shapiro-Barnum argues that events have unfolded about as positively as can be expected. “Viral moments are always a challenge to navigate,” he told me. “But I really hope that the ‘It’s corn’ moment is a step in the right direction when it comes to a community supporting and honoring the source material.”The Corn Kid moment is another opportunity for reflection on how we treat kids whose charisma we find compelling and whose personalities the culture is tempted to consume as entertainment and then sell as a product. Years after St. Félix’s Fader story and the days of “Damn Daniel,” these issues aren’t resolved. But we do have a small set of more direct ways for kids like Tariq to be compensated for creating internet culture that other people want to spread and participate in, as well as a firmer norm about online communities respecting a child’s privacy.There is little reason to assume that Tariq is being pushed into a career as a corn spokesperson or a lifetime as a caricature of himself, or that his family has no grasp of the mechanics of the internet or the possible consequences of fame. “Tariq is the most bubbly, talkative kid who so thoroughly enjoys doing this stuff,” Shapiro-Barnum told me when I asked about his reaction to these kinds of concerns. “He comes from a very sweet, supportive family. I don’t think they would make him do anything he doesn’t want to do.”With that said, please enjoy Labor Day weekend and the end of corn season. It’s corn! But not for much longer.",

        "description": "A group of 50 House Democrats and Republicans is calling on President Biden to share with Congress text of a potential agreement with Iran to return to the 2015 nuclear deal before any papers are signed.\n\n\n\nIn a letter sent Thursday and led by Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), lawmakers raise concerns that provisions reportedly included in the agreement could lead to weakening U.S. sanctions on Iran that are meant to target funding for terrorist activities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe letter comes as international officials are raising the possibility of an imminent agreement between the U.S. and Iran to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\n\n\n\nFrench President Emanuel Macron said Thursday that he hopes the JCPOA will be “concluded in the next few days.”\n\n\n\nAnd Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid on Wednesday, a strong signal that there’s forward movement on a potential deal. The U.S. has maintained close communication with Israel over the negotiations, with Jerusalem virulently opposing a return to the deal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Republicans are near-universally against the JCPOA, Democrats are deeply divided over the effectiveness of the deal, which is intended to trade sanctions relief to Iran in exchange for Tehran agreeing to give up nuclear weapons ambitions and submit to intrusive monitoring of its activities.\n\n\n\nBut Democrats who criticize the deal say it does little to stop Iran from ever achieving a nuclear weapon and does not address other malign Iranian threats, such as its funding of terrorist activities and threats to Israel.\n\n\n\nIn the letter sent Thursday, the lawmakers, which include 34 Democrats and 16 Republicans, raise concerns over a number of reported provisions, including that non-U.S. citizens would not be exposed to sanctions for doing business with U.S.-sanctioned Iranian persons, including those associated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which is designated by the U.S. as a terrorist organization.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden has refused Iranian demands to remove the IRGC’s terrorist designation as a stipulation of the nuclear talks, but the members of Congress raise concern that the draft text risks weakening the U.S. blocks on the group.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The aforementioned reported provision creates a troubling precedent,” the lawmakers wrote. “We are concerned that it could significantly dilute the effectiveness of terrorism-related sanctions on the IRGC, Iran’s paramilitary terror arm and provides the organization with a pathway for sanctions evasion.”\n\n\n\nRob Malley, the U.S. special envoy for Iran talks, wrote in a statement to Politico, which first reported the provision, that the U.S. had not “engaged in any negotiation about changing due diligence … or other U.S. sanctions compliance standards for sanctions that would remain under a mutual return to full [nuclear deal] implementation. Any report to the contrary is flat out wrong.”\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration says the JCPOA is the best chance to reduce the risk of Iran building a nuclear weapon and has engaged in indirect negotiations with Iranian officials for 16 months to bring both parties back to the agreement that former President Trump withdrew the U.S. from in 2018.\n\n\n\nBut the bipartisan letter sent Thursday also raised concern about Russia’s role in the talks given the U.S.-led international isolation campaign against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\nRussia is one of the signatories to the JCPOA, a list that also includes China, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the European Union.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe lawmakers say they oppose any plan that would make Russia responsible for the disposal of Iran’s enriched uranium, a key factor in depleting Tehran’s stockpile of a critical component of nuclear weapons. \n\n\n\n“We should not let war criminal [Russian President] Vladimir Putin be the guarantor of the deal or the keeper of massive amounts of Iran’s enriched uranium. Iran supports the illegal war in Ukraine and has been supplying Russia with drones used to kill Ukrainians,” the lawmakers wrote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Therefore, we urge you not to return to any deal with Iran prior to releasing the full text of the agreement and any side agreements to Congress, to provide us with an in-depth briefing on the matter, and to consult with all key stakeholders. We must address the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran, stand strong against terrorists, and protect American values and our allies.”",

        "description": "The U.S. government will no longer temporarily waive immigration requirements for vulnerable Afghans entering the country, instead focusing on more enduring pathways as the evacuation enters a new phase.\n\n\n\nThe government will largely cease its use of humanitarian parole to allow at-risk Afghans to enter the country after Oct. 1, requiring remaining evacuees to demonstrate family ties in the U.S., a connection with the U.S. military, or that they are among the most vulnerable applicants to the U.S. refugee program.\n\n\n\nThe latest move is a sign of a new phase in the U.S. evacuation effort as the nation marks one year since the military withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nThe move will ensure that those who arrive in the U.S. come with a more stable immigration status. \n\n\n\nThose who are given humanitarian parole at ports of entry are given just two years to secure another immigration pathway — a detail that has left many of the 85,000 Afghans who arrived during the evacuation uncertain about their future.\n\n\n\n\"Moving forward, Afghan arrivals will enter the United States with a durable, long-term immigration status that will facilitate their ability to more quickly settle and integrate into their new communities, and they will also travel directly to their new destination community without the need for a stop-over at a safe haven in the U.S.,\" a senior administration official told reporters.\n\n\n\nBut it could also complicate matters for an untold number of Afghans still hopeful of reaching the U.S.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the government shifts from Operation Allies Welcome to a new program they are calling Operation Enduring Welcome, it has pledged to speed up processing of those hopeful of getting a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) due to their service to the U.S. military — a years-long process that requires high-level State Department approval. Refugee applications similarly take years to process.\n\n\n\n“Our hope is that the Biden administration will recognize the urgency of this moment, just as it has for displaced Ukrainians. Far too many of our allies remain in harm’s way, and far too many families remain separated by bureaucratic hurdles,” Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service (LIRS) said in a statement.\n\n\n\n“As the administration largely discontinues its use of humanitarian parole, it must commit to meaningful and efficient processing under the refugee and SIV programs. While our nation’s commitment to them has no end date, our Afghan allies deserve more than backlogs and red tape.”\n\n\n\nImmigration groups including LIRS have called on Congress to pass the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would help provide a pathway to citizenship to those who were paroled into the U.S. during the evacuation.\n\n\n\nThousands of Afghans remain at processing facilities overseas, however, including in both the United Arab Emirates and in Qatar.\n\n\n\nAnd since March, which the government deemed the second phase of the evacuation, only roughly 5,000 Afghans made it from such centers to the U.S.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, many more remain in Afghanistan who are eager to come to the U.S., but with few pathways to do so. Many are applying to the U.S. refugee program or a separate humanitarian parole program, but face daunting odds.\n\n\n\nThe 49,000 humanitarian parole applications have overwhelmed the Department of Homeland Security, which has ramped up processing, but typically gets only 2,000 such applications per year. It’s not designed to replace the refugee program, the agency has stressed.\n\n\n\nOf the applications that have been reviewed, 9,000 have been denied parole, while just 380 have been granted conditional approval, a roughly 4 percent approval rate.\n\n\n\nThe State Department has also received some 44,000 referrals between the priority refugee programs for Afghans, a figure that does not include the main applicants’ family members. But of those, only 23,000 have been accepted for review after being “determined to be complete.”",

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to quash a subpoena compelling him to testify before a Fulton County, Georgia, special grand jury probing former President Trump's alleged interference into the 2020 election.\n\n\n\nGraham has been fending off a subpoena from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis (D) since July, calling it politically motivated and arguing he cannot be compelled to testify under the Constitution's Speech and Debate Clause, which protects lawmakers from lawsuits related to official legislative duties.\n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge Leigh Martin May in the Northern District of Georgia declined to quash the subpoena in its entirety — but did bar questioning about Graham's calls to state election officials as it relates to fact-finding for his own vote on certifying of the 2020 election, which she ruled fell under the Speech and Debate Clause.\n\n\n\n\"As to the other categories, the Court finds that they are not legislative, and the Speech or Debate Clause does not apply to them,\" May wrote. \"As such, Senator Graham may be questioned about any alleged efforts to encourage Secretary [of State Brad] Raffensperger or others to throw out ballots or otherwise alter Georgia’s election practices and procedures.\" \n\n\n\n\"Likewise, the grand jury may inquire into Senator Graham’s alleged communications and coordination with the Trump Campaign and its post-election efforts in Georgia, as well as into Senator Graham’s public statements related to Georgia’s 2020 elections,\" the judge continued.\n\n\n\nWillis is seeking his testimony on calls Graham made to Raffensperger and other state officials as well as the senator's communications with Trump's team after the 2020 election as part of her investigation into Trump's push to overturn election results in the Georgia county.\n\n\n\nMay denied Graham's motion to quash the subpoena in mid-August, but the senator appealed and secured a victory earlier this month when a three-judge appeals court panel sent the case back to the U.S. District Court.\n\n\n\nIn Thursday's opinion, May argued that calls between Graham and state election officials are \"not manifestly legislative on their face,\" noting comments made by Raffensperger saying Graham asked him to throw out some ballots.\n\n\n\nWhile the judge said questioning on Graham's \"investigatory, fact-finding\" questions related to the Senate's certification of the 2020 election could be limited, May said a broad quash was unreasonable.\n\n\n\n\"The Court does not find that it can simply accept Senator Graham’s sweeping and conclusory characterizations of the calls and ignore other objective facts in the record that call Senator Graham’s characterizations into question,\" May wrote.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3624171-the-us-must-protect-the-identities-of-its-spies/",
        "description": "The U.S. has recently jeopardized the lives of some of its spies by its careless handling of their classified information, as evidenced by&nbsp;documents&nbsp;retrieved from Mar-a-Lago by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\n\n\nThose spies put themselves in danger for the love of the United States. Now their beloved country may be putting them in harm’s way and motivating them to quit. It is critical for the U.S. to protect the identities of its agents for its own good.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. employs more than&nbsp;100,000&nbsp;spies, consultants and foreign nationals to support its national security information needs. Many live under cover, leading double lives, lying to family and friends about who they are and what they do, living on edge thinking about what might happen to them if they were to be exposed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSpying is as old as biblical Moses and Joshua. Spies (or espionage agents or covert investigators) gather and provide intelligence about their targets to policymakers to benefit their country. That is what Moses’s and Joshua’s spies had done, and that is what U.S. spies have been doing. \n\n\n\nThe elimination of Osama bin Laden, responsible for killing almost 3,000 Americans in the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, as well as the termination of his successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, earlier this year would not have been possible without the intelligence provided by dedicated agents and their informants. \n\n\n\nUntil recently, American agents could be confident that their identities would be kept secret by the U.S. to protect their safety and their effectiveness at work. No more. The trust has been broken, as has the willingness of some agents to engage in clandestine work.\n\n\n\nIn my recent book,&nbsp;“Cyberwars,”&nbsp;based on true events, a&nbsp;CIA&nbsp;“consultant” is sent to Russia on an assignment for a dummy corporation. When he needs help, he realizes that he’s been hung out to dry. Trust broken, he took steps to protect himself. This may now be the case with some American agents and their human sources, relationships that took years to cultivate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe purpose of spying is to give one country an edge over another, especially at times of war. In modern times, spies can enhance world stability by reducing the prospects for war. There is almost a tacit understanding among many countries that spying is acceptable, even beneficial, because if a country knew what its enemies were up to through information culled by its agents, it could respond appropriately and peacefully.\n\n\n\nThis way, countries could deter each other and avoid war. It is no secret that most countries have spies embedded in their embassies, aid programs, economic delegations and even universities. For example,&nbsp;China&nbsp;is infamous for sending students to American campuses to conduct industrial espionage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow can the U.S. assure its assets that their identities will never, ever be compromised? How can the U.S. make sure that breaching asset information, like the one that occurred in Mar-a-Lago, won’t happen again?\n\n\n\nI&nbsp;propose two strategies.&nbsp;One is to encrypt agent data and guard it by a select unit so that fewer people have access to the encoded information, and even when they get to see it, they will not be able to decode it easily. This may complicate the handling of such information, but it would assure agents that their country has their backs.\n\n\n\nAnother is a complementary strategy designed to reduce the country’s needs for human assets in favor of using more technology to collect intelligence. Computer deep learning, artificial intelligence, big data and drones can do some of the tasks of human agents, thus reducing the number of spies whose information can be compromised.\n\n\n\nFundamentally, however, human assets who put their lives in danger every day must be promised protection by America’s leaders. And that promise must be kept.\n\n\n\nAvraham&nbsp;Shama&nbsp;is the former dean of the College of Business at the University of Texas, The Pan-American. He is professor emeritus&nbsp;at the Anderson School of Management at&nbsp;the University of New Mexico. His new book, “Cyberwars: David Knight Goes to Moscow,” was recently published by 3rd Coast Books. See: avrahamshama.com.",

        "description": "The House Oversight and Reform Committee on Thursday reached an agreement to obtain former President Trump’s financial records, Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) announced.\n\n\n\nThe agreement would end a years-long legal battle to obtain Trump's financial records and require his accounting firm Mazars USA to turn the documents over to the committee.\n\n\n\n“After numerous court victories, I am pleased that my Committee has now reached an agreement to obtain key financial documents that former President Trump fought for years to hide from Congress,” Maloney said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe Oversight and Reform Committee launched an investigation into Trump’s finances in 2019 over possible conflicts of interest, inaccurate financial disclosures and violations of emoluments clauses.\n\n\n\nAfter the committee subpoenaed Mazars for the former president’s financial records in March 2019, Trump sued to prevent the accounting firm from releasing the documents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA federal appeals court ruled in July of this year that the Oversight and Reform Committee had the authority to subpoena Trump but required that the committee narrow its request.\n\n\n\n“These documents will inform the Committee’s efforts to get to the bottom of former President Trump’s egregious conduct and ensure that future presidents do not abuse their position of power for personal gain,” Maloney added.\n\n\n\nIn a separate lawsuit, a federal appeals court ruled last month that the House Ways and Means Committee was entitled to review Trump’s tax returns from 2015 to 2020. That lawsuit is not covered in the Oversight Committee’s recent agreement, according to CNBC.",

        "description": "Following in the footsteps of apps like Gmail, Drive, Photos, and more, Contacts is poised to be the next Google app on Android to embrace search chip filters. To those unfamiliar, search chips are Material Design elements that use tags or descriptive words to filter content. They are a good alternative to toggle buttons or checkboxes and have been fully embraced by Google in their design language on Android and the web.\n\n\n\nAs reported by Android Police, in what appears to be either an A/B test or early days of a staged rollout, some users are reporting the familiar search chip filters appearing in the Google Contacts Android app. In the below screenshot, you can see what these chips look like and the type of information they filter. For example, I could tap on the chip to only show me email contacts, and everyone in my contacts who does not have an email would be filtered out.\n\n\n\nSource: @panduu221\n\n\nThis new feature is reportedly showing up for those using Contacts version 3.74.21.466997988 or higher, though I am using version 3.75, and the feature isn&#8217;t showing up for me. This further cements that this rollout may be in limited testing. However, we will keep an eye out for this update to reach our devices so we can report back with more information. If this is a test, we hope it sticks and makes it to the next stable version.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Photo by Brett Davis/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Atlanta split the first two games of the series and will have Rookie of the Year candidate Spencer Strider on the hill Thursday.  The Atlanta Braves will try to secure another series win Thursday night when they wrap up a three-game series against the Colorado Rockies. Atlanta snapped just their second three-game losing streak of the season with a 3-2 win Wednesday. Atlanta enters play Thursday 3.0 games behind the New York Mets in the NL East standings. \nSpencer Strider will get the start in Thursday’s finale and will be looking to add to his Rookie of the Year worthy resume. Strider was lights out in August posting a 2.73 ERA and a 1.64 FIP to go along with 38 strikeouts in 26 1/3 innings. His 36.1% strikeout rate as a starter ranks first in the majors for starters who have thrown at least 50 innings. He was excellent in his last start allowing six hits and one run run to go along with seven strikeouts in six innings against the Cardinals. He’s allowed two earned runs combined and struck out 16 in his last 12 innings. \nThe Rockies will go with right-hander Chad Kuhl in the finale. Kuhl got off to a good start for Colorado, but struggled in July and eventually landed on the injured list with a strained hip. He returned on August 26 and allowed five hits and three in five innings against the Mets. Kuhl faced the Braves back on June 3 at Coors Field and held them in check allowing five hits and two walks over six scoreless innings. \nRonald Acuña Jr. returned to the Braves lineup after a three-game absence due to lingering soreness in his knee. He went 1-for-4 at the plate with a 444 foot blast to centerfield for his 11th home run of the season. Afterwards, he told The Athletic’s David O’Brien that the knee is still bothering him, but that it was just something that he is going to have to play through until the season is over. \nAustin Riley hit his team-leading 32nd home run of the season in the first inning of Wednesday’s win. After a torrid July, Riley cooled over the first 24 games in August hitting .207/.327/.326 with just two home runs. He is heating back up of late with seven hits, including two doubles and Wednesday’s homer, in his last four games to end the month. \nThursday’s game is scheduled to get underway at 7:20 p.m. ET and can be seen on Bally Sports South. \nGame Info\nGame Date/Time: Thursday, September 1, 7:20 p.m. ET\nLocation: Truist Park, Atlanta, Georgia\nTV: Bally Sports South\nStreaming: MLB.tv\nRadio: 680 AM / 93.7 FM The Fan",

        "description": "MLB Network\n    \n\n  This is quite intriguing. Baseball is experimenting with quite a number of possible rule changes in the minor leagues. They include a pitch clock, larger bases and the subject of this article, a ball/strike challenge system.\nAnthony Castrovince of MLB.com recently wrote about one game where the ball/strike challenge system was used, Saturday, August 20 in the Triple-A International League between Charlotte (a White Sox affiliate) and Syracuse (a Mets affiliate).\nHere’s how the system is designed:\n\nIn the challenge system, the home-plate umpire calls balls and strikes in the traditional manner, but teams can appeal to the Hawk-Eye “robot ump” on certain calls they deem to be incorrect.\n• Each club starts the game with three challenges.\n• A correct challenge is retained; an incorrect challenge is lost.\n• Challenges may only be made by the batter, the catcher or the pitcher (i.e., no help from the dugout).\n• Challenges must be made immediately following the umpire’s call.\n\nThis seems eminently reasonable; it wouldn’t slow games down too much if used in the major leagues, and the fact that players on the field must immediately use the challenge with no help from the manager or coaches is also quite intriguing.\nCastrovince wrote that five challenges were made in the August 20 game and only one resulted in an overturned call. Here it is:\n\n\nThe strike zone challenge system they are testing in the minors is pretty cool. Challenges can only come from pitcher, catcher, or batter and have to happen right away. pic.twitter.com/yXspD8Qlmw— Jomboy (@Jomboy_) August 26, 2022\n\n\n\nYou can hear the plate umpire call “Ball!” in the video, and even the announcers thought the pitch was a strike. It was challenged and immediately overturned. The entire process took less than 30 seconds. Remember that bad call on Christopher Morel last Saturday in Milwaukee? The Cubs would have challenged that, got it overturned and then they’d have had runners on first and second with two out and Nick Madrigal due up in a game that was still 0-0 in the seventh inning. Obviously we’ll never know what might have happened, but the Cubs would have at least had another chance to take the lead. This is how such challenges can have real impacts on game outcomes.\nEventually, I think we will have a complete automated ball/strike calling system in the major leagues; that’s also being tested in other minor leagues this summer and likely will be again in 2023. But until such a system is in place, why not have this sort of thing in MLB games? Three challenges per team wouldn’t slow things down much and likely, managers would instruct the players responsible for making the challenge on the field hold them for critical situations in the game. The one shown here, on a 1-1 count in the fourth inning, probably wouldn’t qualify, but again, you can see how easily and quickly the system works.\nOne other thing from Castrovince’s article, about the length of this game, a 4-3 win for Charlotte in which there were 13 hits and eight walks, seems important:\n... this 2-hour, 17-minute game was also a much crisper, faster-paced brand of baseball than many of us are accustomed to.\nTwo hours, 17 minutes. A game similar to that in MLB nowadays, with the home team not batting in the bottom of the ninth, likely runs about 2:50 to 2:55.\nIncidentally, since teams retain their challenges if they are correct, there can be more than three per team. Wednesday, that happened in a game between the Triple-A Sugar Land Space Cowboys and Albuquerque Isotopes (and yes, those are real team names):\n\n\nWe had a whopping thirteen (13) ball/strike \"ABS challenges\" tonight. (You start with 3 and only lose them if you're wrong.)Sugar Land was 6-for-7 on challenges.The Isotopes were 4-of-6 on challenges, including a ball 4 that was overturned to strike 3 to end an inning.— Josh Suchon (@Josh_Suchon) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system was very fast, around 5-10 seconds for each challenge.The videoboard here at Constellation Field showed the location. All the players turned around to see for themselves the precise location.Only 1 hitter used a challenge. The other 12 were by pitcher/catcher.— Josh Suchon (@Josh_Suchon) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nSo even with that many challenges, it didn’t slow this game down too much. Sugar Land won 8-6 in a game that had 21 hits and 13 walks, and even with all the challenges it ran 3:12. \nI really like this ball/strike challenge system and hope they are considering adopting it for MLB games in 2023.",

        "description": "The FBI photographed documents marked &quot;Top Secret&quot; on the floor of former President Trump&#x27;s office in Mar-a-Lago, Fla. The redacted image was included in a Justice Department filing.Department of JusticeThe photo hit the internet like a mic drop. When the Justice Department rejected President Trump&#x27;s call for a special master in his records dispute, it included a photo of top secret documents splayed across a carpeted floor in Mar-a-Lago — two months after Trump&#x27;s team certified all such documents had been turned over. The photo, which many observers called unprecedented, immediately drove discussions about Trump&#x27;s legal problems into overdrive. To Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, the jaw-drop-inducing photo and filing are the latest steps in an extraordinary sequence, with the U.S. government arguing about national secrets with its former chief executive.  &quot;This is an unusual response, but that&#x27;s to be expected,&quot; Kerr said. &quot;It was filed in reply to an unusual request by a judge to respond to a very unusual filing by Trump.&quot;The photo was staged for dramatic effect, Trump&#x27;s team saysIn their own response filed late Wednesday, Trump&#x27;s legal team called the Justice Department&#x27;s filing &quot;extraordinary.&quot; They accuse the government of &quot;criminalizing a former President&#x27;s possession of personal and Presidential records in a secure setting.&quot;Trump&#x27;s team also homed in on the image of the documents, with attorney Lindsey Halligan writing that the Justice Department &quot;gratuitously included a photograph of allegedly classified materials, pulled from a container and spread across the floor for dramatic effect.&quot;As photographs go, the FBI image doesn&#x27;t look particularly well-composed, with papers scattered across the carpet. But those papers&#x27; bright yellow and red markings, their &quot;TOP SECRET&quot; coversheets, make the randomness of the scene  more striking: here is hard-won information that&#x27;s highly compartmentalized by the government, lying on the floor of a private office in Florida.&quot;In some instances, even the FBI counterintelligence personnel and DOJ attorneys conducting the review required additional clearances&quot; before they could examine some folders&#x27; contents, the Justice Department said.What about those abbreviations?The photo quickly sparked intense interest into the arcane abbreviations that label America&#x27;s national secrets. One of the most scrutinized markings states that several folders&#x27; contents are marked &quot;TOP SECRET//SCI&quot; and restricted &quot;UP TO HCS-P/SI/TK.&quot; Here&#x27;s a quick breakdown of those terms:HCS-P - HUMINT Control System Product, using the acronym for human intelligence. According to the office of the Director of National Intelligence&#x27;s classification manual, &quot;HCS protects the most sensitive HUMINT operations and information acquired from clandestine and/or uniquely sensitive HUMINT sources, methods, and certain technical collection capabilities, technologies, and methods linked to or supportive of HUMINT.&quot;SCI - Sensitive Compartmented Information, a broad term for intelligence information that requires a formal system to control its distribution.SI - Special Intelligence, or more specifically, &quot;technical and intelligence information derived from the monitoring of foreign communications signals by other than the intended recipients&quot; — the type of work done by the National Security Agency, for instance.TK - Talent Keyhole, a long-held designation that refers to classified spy satellite data.Those terms are merely on the cover sheets. The internal documents themselves were redacted, along with their detailed compartmentalized designations.Which case is this again?While Trump&#x27;s legal embroilments are extensive, this particular case dates to Aug. 22, when the former president asked a federal district judge in Florida to appoint a special master to review all the materials taken from his home. Trump is the plaintiff in the case; the defendant is the United States of America. &quot;Politics cannot be allowed to impact the administration of justice,&quot; Trump&#x27;s team said in its initial filing, calling him &quot;the clear frontrunner&quot; in the 2024 presidential race, &quot;should he decide to run.&quot;In that filing, Trump sought to block the Justice Department from reviewing the materials until a special master is appointed. He also asked the judge to make the government provide a &quot;sufficiently detailed receipt&quot; of seized items, and &quot;promptly return anything taken that is outside of the search warrant&#x27;s scope. The judge in the case is Aileen M. Cannon, whom Trump appointed in 2020. She is herself a veteran of the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office in Southern Florida, which is now contesting the case.\n&quot;In a normal case, a judge would find DOJ&#x27;s response persuasive and would be done with it,&quot; Kerr said. &quot;It&#x27;s possible that this particular judge will try to give more to Trump, but my guess is that it won&#x27;t matter much: Whether a special master is appointed probably doesn&#x27;t make much difference to the case.&quot;\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "A funny black cat named Ari hilariously walks like a crab around her human Liz DeSousa&#8216;s apartment while carrying an almond in her mouth.\n\n\n\nAri, the rescued black cat sneaks around her house all day long and is obsessed with tiny almonds.\n\n\n\nDeSousa adopted a three month old Ari from the New York branch of  Best Friends Animal Society. At first, Ari was a typical kitten doing really typically cute kitten things. After she became comfortable in her new home, Ari&#8217;s distinct personality shone through.  She then began to crabwalk, fluff herself up, pose, perform parkour, and become best friends with almonds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has a really short attention span for most toys, so I gave her an almond to play with and she never got bored of it.

        "description": "A new synthetic protein quickly detects molecules of a deadly nerve agent, VX.\nThe development could pave the way for a new generation of tailor-made biosensors and treatments that could be deployed against the chemical warfare agent.\nAs described in Science Advances, the team created the protein through a special design on high-speed computers.\n&#8220;We&#8217;ve made an artificial protein that binds a chemical target—in this case, the VX nerve agent,&#8221; says Vikas Nanda, a scientist at the Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine (CABM) at Rutgers University, and an author of the study in Science Advances.\n&#8220;We wanted to design it to generate a signal that could be coupled to a device, making a biosensor for chemical weapons. And we&#8217;ve been able to achieve that.&#8221;\nVX is an odorless, tasteless, human-made chemical compound that is the most toxic and rapidly acting of any of the known chemical warfare agents. It works by attacking the nervous system, causing muscle paralysis and death via asphyxiation within minutes.\nBecause the United Nations has classified VX as a weapon of mass destruction, countries are banned from stockpiling it. However, nations are permitted to store small amounts for research.\nThe researchers designed the protein to have a cavity at its center that matched the precise shape and chemical composition of VX. Collaborators at the City College of New York took the Rutgers design and produced a real version of the protein, purified it, and shipped the sample on ice overnight to an approved chemical weapon testing facility, MRIGlobal in Kansas City, Missouri. There, researchers tested the protein against VX within 24 hours.\n&#8220;The protein underwent a dramatic shape change, burying VX in the cavity we designed,&#8221; says Nanda, also a professor in the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. &#8220;This shape change is the signal which could be coupled to a sensor device.&#8221;\nThe protein can detect VX at levels a thousand times more sensitive than current technologies, Nanda says. In addition, the protein doesn&#8217;t produce false positives that occur when present-day sensors accidentally detect non-nerve agent chemicals which are similar, like some pesticides.\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, VX or other nerve agents were possibly used in chemical warfare during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. Chemical weapons experts have alleged it also has been used more recently in warfare and, in one case, an assassination. While antidotes are available for VX, they are most useful if given as soon as possible after exposure.\n&#8220;The design method presented here should enable the development of a new generation of biosensors, therapeutics, and diagnostics,&#8221; Nanda says.\nDouglas Pike, a graduate student at CABM, contributed to the study. Additional coauthors are from City College of New York and Clarkson University.\nSource: Rutgers University\nThe post Synthetic protein binds to VX nerve agent appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Updated at 4:50 p.m. ET on September 1, 2022.Mary Peltola was declared the winner of Alaska’s special congressional election last night, defeating the former GOP vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin. A Democrat hasn’t held the seat in 49 years, and Peltola will be the first Alaska Native elected to Congress.The election was the first in Alaska to utilize ranked-choice voting, a system adopted by the state’s voters in 2020. If no candidate reaches 50 percent support, the lowest-ranked candidate is eliminated and their votes go to the second-ranked candidate on their voters’ lists. This continues until one candidate has at least 50 percent. After the Republican candidate Nick Begich was eliminated in the second round of counting, Peltola ended up with about 52 percent of the vote. Ranked choice is more efficient than holding a runoff election, and its backers insist that it offers a better reflection of voters’ preferences.But here’s the problem: The Republican candidate didn’t win, and Peltola’s remarkable victory instantly sparked complaints from Republicans that the election had been “rigged,” echoing former President Donald Trump’s rhetoric from July. Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas immediately tweeted, “Ranked-choice voting is a scam to rig elections.” Cotton elaborated in a second tweet that “60% of Alaska voters voted for a Republican, but thanks to a convoluted process and ballot exhaustion—which disenfranchises voters—a Democrat ‘won.’” Separately, the political writer Josh Kraushaar argued that ranked-choice voting “is so inscrutable to your average voter that it will only fuel the conspiracy theories that have defined elections in recent years.”[Read: A step toward blowing up the presidential-voting system]This is a bit like arguing that denying a toddler ice cream for dinner will only fuel a temper tantrum, except that Republican elites who choose to announce that elections they don’t win are fraudulent are adults and should be held responsible for their choices. Conspiracy theories are not “being fueled”; people like Cotton are fueling them.There is nothing inherently wrong with opposing ranked-choice voting. There’s also nothing wrong with arguing that a particular set of rules is unfair, or might skew the outcome in one direction or another. People will come to different conclusions about the most fair or efficient way to run elections. That’s all a normal part of democracy. The difference here is that Alaska’s system is not being evaluated on the basis of whether or not it results in a fair election, but whether it produces a GOP victory. If it does not, then the system is corrupt by definition.For Trumpists, no system that results in a Republican defeat can be considered legitimate, a belief that manifested in the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021. (To Cotton’s credit, unlike many other ambitious conservative senators, he rejected Trump’s election conspiracies then.) Before losing the California gubernatorial-recall election last year, Republicans were already announcing that the outcome had been “rigged,” rhetoric, as The New York Times noted at the time, that “reflects a growing instinct on the right to argue that any lost election, or any ongoing race that might result in defeat, must be marred by fraud.” Otherwise, how could a Democrat win an election in California?It’s amusing to hear Republicans devoted to the Electoral College argue that the person who gets the most votes should win the election, and that anything else amounts to disenfranchisement. Everyone knew the rules of this election before it was held. A majority of Alaskan voters might have preferred to support a Republican in theory, but they did not prefer Palin, the actual Republican candidate they ended up with. States are not party fiefdoms that are inherited by whatever empty suit the Republican National Committee sticks on the ballot. A majority of Alaskan voters preferred the Democrat. The fact that this could happen in a state as conservative as Alaska is really the GOP’s failure.[David A. Graham: The Republican Party’s irrational war on voting rights]That conservatives are embracing majoritarian arguments to argue against ranked-choice voting is nevertheless illuminating, because it shows that they believe in majoritarianism only where Republicans can expect a majority. Otherwise, they seem to believe, some sort of electoral system is necessary to properly weight the votes of conservative constituencies so that they count more than everyone else’s. As the only true Americans, they’re entitled to win every election every time. Anything else is just election rigging.This article previously misidentified the Republican candidate Nick Begich as former Democratic Senator Mark Begich of Alaska.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3624349-time-to-deescalate-taiwan-strait-tensions/",
        "description": "Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) made news last week for her high-profile visit to Taiwan. This was the second congressional visit to Taipei following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) controversial visit in early August that triggered a new round of tensions in the Taiwan Strait.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) led a bipartisan group to Taiwan on Aug. 14-15.&nbsp;Like Pelosi and Markey, Blackburn’s stated objective is to show support for Taiwan in face of the People's Republic of China (PRC) aggressiveness.\n\n\n\nFollowing the establishment of diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing in 1979, Congress enacted the Taiwan Relations Act to preserve robust, albeit unofficial, relations with Taipei. Congressional visits to Taiwan have a long history as a way to support Taiwan, but they tend to be low-key and less frequent. The recent stream of official congressional visits to Taiwan are both unprecedented and unhelpful.\n\n\n\nTaipei has become a new mecca for some politicians. With each official congressional visit to Taiwan, the United States and China become more distrustful and the Taiwan Strait becomes less secure, as evidenced by the exchange of acrimonious accusations between Washington and Beijing and continued Chinese military exercises near Taiwan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlthough travel destinations of members of Congress are not to be dictated by others, the timing and consequences of such visits may create problems — a major reason why the Biden administration and many observers and former U.S. officials expressed disapproval before Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.\n\n\n\nWhat exactly is the purpose of such visits when U.S.-China relations are at an historic low?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAre some members of Congress trying to goad China to start a war to weaken China, much like the proxy war in Ukraine, through which the U.S. has vowed to defeat Russia? Or do they represent the military-industrial complex to promote weapons sales to Taiwan?\n\n\n\nThe long-standing U.S. policy, as stipulated by the Taiwan Relations Act, is to maintain “unofficial relations” with Taiwan. Yet, recent congressional trips to Taipei have all the trappings of official visits. The official U.S. policy is not to support Taiwan independence. Yet, while meeting with President Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei, Blackburn said she “looked forward to continuing to support Taiwan as they push forward as an independent nation.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCongress can help lower tensions in the Taiwan Strait by strictly following America’s spoken and longstanding “one China” policy, not a “one China, one Taiwan” policy that is bound to lead to conflict with Beijing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe People’s Liberation Army (PLA) reacted fiercely to what they see as erosion of the “one China” policy and changed the security situation around Taiwan. The simulated blockade of Taiwan following Pelosi’s visit as well as daily intrusion by PLA aircraft and warships into areas near Taiwan demonstrate the island’s security is being undermined.\n\n\n\nInstead of provoking a war, members of Congress can help lower tensions in the Taiwan Strait.\n\n\n\nFirst, they should work in tandem with the White House to project a consistent Taiwan policy. Members of Congress can visit Taiwan or anywhere they would like to go, and they can express their own sentiments, but it does not mean they are free to do or say anything contrary to official U.S. policy or intentionally create a crisis. Separation of powers cannot be used to justify departure from official U.S. policy or provocative behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSecond, they must keep communication channels open with Beijing. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman met with Chinese ambassador Qin Gang to signal that despite differences, the two governments are committed to peaceful dialogue. With almost weekly visits to Taiwan by members of Congress and other U.S. politicians now, one is reminded that the last congressional trip to the PRC took place in August 2019, when a group headed by Rep. Dina Titus (D-Nev.) was there to mark the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations. If some members of Congress dislike China’s behavior so much, why not travel to Beijing to speak to Chinese officials directly?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThird, they need to work with U.S. allies and partners to develop a concerted Taiwan policy. Members of Congress will shrug off Beijing’s protests, but they should not ignore concerns from regional countries. Most countries in the Asia Pacific do not favor such congressional visits and seem to side with China in the current dispute. U.S. allies and friends such as Singapore and Australia have expressed deep anxieties about the possibility of the two powers sleepwalking into war. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol even shunned meeting with Pelosi as she flew to Seoul from Taipei.\n\n\n\nHigh-profile official congressional visits to Taiwan contradict America’s long-standing policy of maintaining “unofficial relations” with Taiwan, push the U.S. closer to war with China, unsettle U.S. allies and friends, and make Taiwan less safe. Members of Congress can do better to support Taiwan’s democracy while advancing peace in East Asia.\n\n\n\nZhiqun Zhu is a professor of political science and international relations at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pa.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/3624312-costs-associated-with-carbon-emissions-three-times-federal-estimate-study/",
        "description": "The social cost of carbon is significantly higher than the federal estimate, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Nature. \n\n\n\nResearchers put the financial toll associated with projected future carbon emissions at $185 per ton of carbon pollution added to the atmosphere, more than three times the federal government’s figure of $51. \n\n\n\nThey arrived at the conclusion in part by using a lower discount rate, or the cost-benefit analysis of reducing emissions now versus the future impacts of inaction. Lower discount rates result in higher estimates for the price of inaction.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Our estimate, which draws on recent advances in the scientific and economic literature, shows that we are vastly underestimating the harm of each additional ton of carbon dioxide that we release into the atmosphere,” co-author Richard G. Newell, president and CEO of the think tank Resources for the Future, said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\"The implication is that the benefits of government policies and other actions that reduce global warming pollution are greater than has been assumed.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe current federal social cost of carbon estimate is itself the Obama-era estimate. Upon taking office in 2017, the Trump administration dismantled the working group that made the estimate and announced a dramatically smaller estimate of $1 to $7 a ton. \n\n\n\nThe Biden administration has since restored the $51 estimate but has pledged to update the number. As of September 2022, no updated estimate has been published. The Hill has reached out to the White House for clarity on the timeline for an update.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe study is the second in as many years to suggest both the Trump and Biden administrations are substantially underestimating the cost. \n\n\n\nA July 2021 study published in Nature Communications put the price even higher, at up to $258 per ton, by factoring in estimated excess deaths associated with increased emissions. ",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/equilibrium-sustainability/3624281-california-advances-climate-measures-votes-to-keep-nuclear-plant-open/",
        "description": "California state lawmakers passed an array of climate bills late Wednesday as their legislative session ticked to a close and amid an ongoing heat wave that threatens to cripple the state's electricity grid.\n\n\n\nWhile advancing several climate measures, legislators also voted to extend the shelf life of a fiercely disputed nuclear plant — a move supported by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) as a reliable backup for California’s transition to clean energy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“On the whole, this session was a huge win for our environment and public health,” Laura Deehan, state director for the group Environment California, said in&nbsp;a statement while voicing her disappointment about the nuclear plant decision.\n\n\n\n“We have no need for this potentially dangerous power source given the unstoppable momentum toward a state running on 100 percent clean, safe and renewable power — momentum that will only grow given other bills that passed,” Deehan added.\n\n\n\nAmong the legislation to receive a green light and head to Newsom's desk for a signature is S.B. 1020, which would require 90 percent of the state’s electricity to come from clean energy sources by 2035 and 95 percent by 2040. Those are interim targets toward a 100 percent goal for 2045, and all electricity procured for state agencies would need to come from clean energy by 2035, according to the bill.\n\n\n\nA second key item to get a go-ahead was S.B. 1137, which would prohibit oil drilling within 3,200 feet of places where residents live, work and learn, if signed into law. \n\n\n\nOther bills approved by the legislature would allocate significant funds to&nbsp;clean transportation&nbsp;and energy, establish a statewide&nbsp;carbon capture program&nbsp;and create an incentives-based plan to promote the use of&nbsp;sustainable aviation fuel.\n\n\n\nNewsom has until Sept. 30 to sign or veto the legislation, although several of the items are part of his state climate package.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“California is lighting the way to a bright future powered by renewable energy, including wind, solar, and battery storage,” Deehan said.\n\n\n\n“We know we will see even hotter heat waves, more severe droughts, and fiercer wildfires if we don’t act on climate,” she added. “The legislature took significant steps today to change that trajectory for the better.”\n\n\n\nCalifornia Environmental Voters, a progressive environmental advocacy group, described 2022 as “a breakthrough year on climate action” in&nbsp;a statement&nbsp;issued after the legislative session wrapped up.\n\n\n\n“After years of inaction, 2022 is an unprecedented year of climate leadership,” the group stated, acknowledging that there is more work to be done.\n\n\n\nWhile environmental organizations largely applauded the legislature’s decisions, many groups expressed disappointment about other measures that did not receive approval.\n\n\n\nA proposal to establish stricter emissions reduction targets — A.B. 2133 — passed the state Senate but failed to do so in the Assembly.\n\n\n\nThat legislation would have required a decrease in statewide greenhouse gas emissions to at least 55 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 —&nbsp;a significant jump from current law, which requires a 40 percent reduction by that time.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most contentious item, however, was a bill that gave a lifeline to the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant — S.B. 846 — which passed by 31-1 in the state Senate and 69-3 in the Assembly late into the night on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nIf signed into law, the bill would invalidate a previously approved plan under which Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) would retire the facility’s two units by 2024 and 2025. Instead, both units would be able to continue functioning until the end of 2030, per the text of the bill.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Newsom proposed extending the plant’s life by five to 10 years, with the goal of maintaining a carbon-free, reliable power supply as the state transitions to solar, wind and other renewable sources of energy,&nbsp;The Associated Press reported.\n\n\n\nJust hours prior to the legislature’s vote on Wednesday, Newsom declared a state of emergency and warned of possible strain on the state’s electricity grid this week due to an ongoing heat wave that has been scorching much of the West. The governor asked Californians to decrease their consumption between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. to minimize risks of outages.\n\n\n\nDespite California’s need for more carbon-free electricity, environmental groups largely oppose the idea of keeping Diablo Canyon open — questioning both its seismic safety and the fact that the proposal includes a forgivable loan for PG&amp;E of up to $1.4 billion.\n\n\n\nThe days leading up to Wednesday’s vote involved intense lobbying from these organizations, while Newsom’s office was calling wavering legislators, the AP reported.\n\n\n\nThe 1960s-era plant, located halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, today generates about 9 percent of the state’s electricity, according to the AP.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I’m not a proponent of the Diablo Canyon power plant. But I am a proponent of keeping the lights on,” Democratic Assemblyman Chris Holden said during his arguments for a bill, as reported by the AP.\n\n\n\nThe Environmental Working Group — whose president, Ken Cook, is based in the Bay Area — slammed the decision, saying state legislators “voted to rush through a bailout bill for the facility.” \n\n\n\nThe group argued that pushing the bill through the legislature in the last week of the session did not give lawmakers sufficient time to determine whether the plant should continue operating.\n\n\n\n“The rush by lawmakers and Gov. Newsom to keep Diablo Canyon running is dangerous and dumb and will only set back California’s drive to make solar and wind the prevailing sources of electricity in the state,” Cook said in&nbsp;a statement.\n\n\n\nHis organization, Cook added, intends to “explore every available opportunity — administratively, legally and policy-wise — to prevent the extended operation of Diablo Canyon.”\n\n\n\nAmerican Clean Power-California, a clean industry trade organization, characterized the Diablo Canyon vote as a reminder that the state must work to speed up its clean energy transition.\n\n\n\n“The last ditch scramble to extend the life of Diablo Canyon must serve as a wakeup call for California,” a statement from the group said.\n\n\n\n“To avoid prolonging expensive and inflexible facilities, and imposing those costs on ratepayers, the administration must accelerate the work of state agencies to site and permit new carbon-free resources,” the group added.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3623895-lawmakers-should-rein-in-the-runaway-ftc/",
        "description": "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has released a playbook for how the agency will expand its power over the American economy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan has aggressively pursued a hyper-regulatory agenda since her&nbsp;bait-and-switch&nbsp;confirmation last summer. Lawmakers should conduct robust oversight hearings to determine just how far the agency has strayed from its statutory authority under Khan’s leadership.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLate last week, the FTC&nbsp;released&nbsp;its updated strategic plan for FY 22-26 after months of deliberation. For decades, the FTC has pledged to police harmful business practices “without unduly burdening legitimate business activity.” That clause,&nbsp;present in&nbsp;every strategic plan since 2006 and originally articulated in 1997, is absent without explanation in Khan’s plan. The clause’s omission signals that Khan’s FTC will target legitimate business activity, a guilty-until-proven-innocent posture that will chill innovation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs a whole, the document moves the agency’s focus away from maximizing consumer welfare and towards other vague social goals that progressives believe antitrust law can solve. For the past half-century, business conduct is generally not considered an antitrust violation unless it demonstrably harms consumers, a legal test called the&nbsp;consumer welfare standard. The consumer welfare standard constrains the government from launching antitrust suits against companies for political reasons.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn her&nbsp;dissent&nbsp;to Khan’s Strategic Plan, FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson concludes that Khan’s focus on arbitrary social goals instead of consumer welfare “will result in higher prices, suppressed production, fewer choices, and dampened innovation.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nScrutinizing the strategic plan is not an academic exercise, as Khan is currently pursuing cases that stretch the bounds of antitrust law. The FTC recently challenged Meta’s acquisition of Within, a virtual reality (VR) fitness app developer, in a case that is flimsy at best and meritless at worst. The FTC voted 3-2 along party lines to sue Meta, overruling career FTC staff that recommended against bringing the case.\n\n\n\nThe core of the FTC’s case is not that the acquisition would harm consumers. Rather, the agency asserts that Meta should not be able to buy Within because of its size, a radical departure from current antitrust tradition. Progressives believe that bureaucrats, not consumers, should decide how big a company is or what a market should look like.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the complaint, the FTC invents an artificially narrow market definition to depict Meta as attempting to monopolize the VR fitness market.&nbsp;The market definition conveniently excludes fitness-specific VR apps and broadband-connected fitness apps, intentionally ignoring the existence of competitors such as FitXR and Peloton. The FTC’s complaint fails to acknowledge the many other ways Americans can get up and move, like going to the gym, hiking, running outside or kickboxing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe business community at large is beginning to recognize the threat Khan’s mission creep poses to the economy. Walmart recently&nbsp;filed a motion&nbsp;to dismiss a lawsuit the agency launched in June, calling the suit an “egregious instance of agency overreach” and saying that the agency lacked “constitutionally valid authority to sue for money or injunctive relief.” Former FTC staffers&nbsp;have called&nbsp;the Walmart case “far-fetched.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKhan’s expansive agenda will likely lead to the FTC’s power being curtailed by other branches of government. The Supreme Court will hear&nbsp;FTC v. Axon&nbsp;this coming term, a case that examines the constitutionality of the FTC’s administrative trial process that has led to a 100 percent win rate for the agency over the past 25 years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere is no shortage of material for Congress to probe in oversight hearings. FTC staff morale has&nbsp;plummeted,&nbsp;with one staffer saying that under Khan’s leadership, the agency “[has] a willingness to just kind of ignore the law and the facts sometimes if it’s going to further the ideological mission.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Senate antitrust subcommittee&nbsp;will hold&nbsp;an oversight hearing on Khan and Antitrust Division chief Jonathan Kanter in September. House Judiciary Ranking Member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) recently&nbsp;sent a letter&nbsp;to Khan demanding information on the FTC’s reliance on unpaid “consultants” to perform core functions at the agency.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKhan’s command and control agenda is a clear and present danger to the U.S. economy, but Congress doesn’t have to take it lying down. Instead of expanding the FTC’s power via misguided antitrust legislation, lawmakers should work to rein the runaway agency in.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTom Hebert is federal affairs manager for Americans for Tax Reform and executive director of the Open Competition Center.&nbsp;",

        "description": "More than 30 worker and civil society groups are demanding Amazon CEO Andy Jassy testify in a congressional hearing on the company’s worker safety “crisis.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a letter sent to Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and top lawmakers on two congressional labor committees on Thursday, the coalition urged the lawmakers to hold a congressional hearing on “the dangerous labor practices” the groups said have caused a number of deaths and injuries at Amazon warehouse facilities and to call Jassy and others \"responsible\" for those conditions to testify.\n\n\n\nThe letter noted that three Amazon workers at a New Jersey warehouse facility died last month within a three-week span and about 34,000 serious injuries were reported at company facilities last year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe groups also cited a report from the Strategic Organizing Center that found on-site injuries at the company’s facilities around the country increased by 20 percent from 2020 to 2021 and another report from nonprofit organization Make the Road NJ that noted injuries at Amazon fulfillment centers in New Jersey increased by 54 percent in that time.\n\n\n\n“Amazon should not be offering its ‘thoughts and prayers’ — Amazon should be taking action to protect the lives of all workers. I know about Amazon’s failures when it comes to health and safety because I experienced them,” Make the Road NJ member and former Amazon employee Nayeli Sulca said in a statement. “Luckily, I’m still here to be able to talk about it. My heart goes out to the families of the workers who will not be able to do the same.”\n\n\n\n“We demand that our representatives in Congress convene a hearing and hold Amazon and its CEO accountable for the ongoing safety crisis in warehouses. Congress must act now to ensure Amazon workers’ lives are respected –– that means strong enforcement of health and safety laws, and ensuring Amazon respects workers rights to organize.”\n\n\n\nAmazon in recent months has seen a number of its U.S. warehouses file petitions to hold union elections. Earlier this year, one of Amazon's Staten Island facilities became the first of the company's U.S. locations to vote to unionize.\n\n\n\nIn their union organizing efforts, Amazon workers have cited low wages and poor working conditions as their high-priority concerns.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“These tragedies are yet more gruesome examples of how Amazon treats workers as disposable, pushing their bodies to the brink—and even to the point of death—to maximize its profits,” National Employment Law Project Executive Director Rebecca Dixon said in a statement. “Amazon must not allow even one more person to be injured or killed and they must start treating workers as human beings instead of as bits of data.\n\n\n\n“Courageous Amazon workers around the country are actively organizing and demanding changes, and elected leaders must stand with them. The time for congressional hearings is now.”\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Amazon for comment and more information.",

        "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday implored an audience at the Venice Film Festival to resist indifference to his country's conflict with Russia as the months-long war rages on. \n\n\n\nAppearing on the festival’s Sala Grande screen, Zelensky told the global film industry audience that Russia is staging “a primitive plot in three acts for the world to make three dramatic mistakes. To get used to the war. To put up with the war. To forget about the war.”\n\n\n\nMore than half a year since Russia first invaded, the war in Ukraine is “a drama based on real-life events” that is “embodied in life by real savages, murderers, torturers, terrorists,” Zelensky said.\n\n\n\n“A tragedy accompanied not by Morricone's brilliant music, but by gruesome ditties and sounds of explosions, gunshots and air raid sirens. Horror, not 120 minutes but 189 days long.”\n\n\n\nThe Ukrainian president’s speech introduced a credits-like scroll of the names of 358 Ukrainian children under the heading \"Russia killed.\"\n\n\n\n“I want every country, every nation, every institution and community in the world to have a clear idea of what Ukraine is going through now. To hear about this war in the most understandable language. For you, this is the language of cinematography,” Zelensky said, noting that most viewers would \"stand up and leave\" during closing credits.\n\n\n\n“Whenever someone talks about being tired of Ukraine, these titles should be mentioned. To get tired of Ukraine means to brush off these names. To forget these names.”\n\n\n\nThe video reported 735 children wounded in the conflict, 223 children missing and another 7,013 children abducted or forcibly taken out of the country. \n\n\n\nZelensky’s speech came the night before a mission of experts from the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency arrived Thursday at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya plant, where the conflict with Russia has stoked concerns about potential nuclear accident.  \n\n\n\nRussia has controlled the area where the nuclear power plant, still operated by Ukrainians, is located since early in the war, and the two countries have swapped blame for recent nearby strikes that Ukraine says have damaged buildings at the plant.\n\n\n\nZelensky has called the shelling “Russian nuclear terror” and warned of a possible “radiation disaster.”\n\n\n\nSens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) met with Zelensky in Ukraine on Tuesday, a week after President Biden announced a nearly $3 billion security assistance package to support Ukraine as the conflict drags on.",

This article (with a wonderfully puzzling illustration of online learning in which almost everything is completely analog) is an indicator of that. \"We have a generation of young people who have grown up on personal devices that allow them to customise anything important to them: playlists, blogs, chats. They successfully communicate with friends, family and partners, expressing their passions and interests via remote devices. For the most part, they understand how to use those devices effectively for their needs. Why can't it be the same with learning?\"\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

Something important is going on out there, but it takes time and marketplace experience to sort things out.\" Still - and here is where I think most criticism comes in - I have zero interest in what is called here an 'internet of value'. While it may be true that \"contracts, transactions, and the records of them are among the defining structures in our economic, legal, and political systems,\" I don't think they should be, and there are many more important things in the world. But this isn't a problem with the technology, it's a problem with a world view that see things exclusively in terms of money, laws and power.

She likes to have a broad social network, she said — with folks from all different backgrounds.Some of those friends she’s met through clubs and activities, like volleyball and Indian classical dance. Gleaming trophies from over the years are on display in her family’s living room.“My dance friends, they&#x27;ve been the same for eight years. So we&#x27;re all very close with each other.”Wayzata High School is the largest high school in Minnesota, by enrollment. So Nikki is a little nervous about navigating the halls. She thinks she has a difficult year ahead of her— with a math class first up in the morning. But she feels ready.“It’s not going to be like the movies … because it’s very dramatized.” Evan Bierscheid, Roseville Area High SchoolEvan Bierscheid is an incoming ninth-grader at Roseville Area High School on Aug 25, in Roseville, Minn.Kerem Yücel | MPR NewsWhen Evan Bierscheid graduates high school, he wants music to be part of his life — whether that’s as a musical artist, or a producer, studio musician or sound engineer. He’s taking a music production class this year, in addition to playing percussion in band, and hopes to take more music classes as they’re offered.“I&#x27;m not necessarily excited to go back to school, but I&#x27;ve had a long enough time, where I&#x27;m like … I&#x27;m not dreading it or anything,” he said.The new environment is a bit nerve-wracking. His mom worked at his middle school — in high school, he’ll be more on his own. Luckily, many of his friends from middle school will be with him at Roseville Area High School.“I haven&#x27;t had that same age difference between me and the seniors since I was in third grade,” he said. “So it&#x27;s gonna be a little weird being like, I guess kind of like the younger kid again. Like, wow, some of you are literal adults. And I&#x27;m like, 14.”Anna Penz, Cretin Derham-Hall High SchoolAnna Penz is a ninth-grader at Cretin-Derham Hall High School.Kerem Yücel | MPR NewsLucy Bradford, Highland Park Senior HighLucy Bradford is an incoming ninth-grader at Highland Park High School.Kerem Yücel | MPR NewsLucy Bradford and Anna Penz have known each other their entire lives. They’ve been neighbors since they were three years old.But they’ll be heading to different high schools this year — even though they’d hoped they’d both be attending Highland Park. But they don’t think it will impact their friendship.“It&#x27;s nice to have a reason to see each other … especially at the start of the summer,” Anna said. “Like there&#x27;s always like a recap that happens.”They have the first-day jitters  — their middle school teachers told them high school would be challenging, but they’re not sure what to expect.“I know going from elementary school to middle school, all the teachers are like, ‘You guys are going to middle school, this is a big deal.’ And then you go to middle school, and it&#x27;s like the exact same almost,” Lucy said. “So I think it&#x27;d be pretty similar.”“I&#x27;m gonna try to focus on my academics this year, because I know freshman year can be a really big part,” Anna said. “And if you don&#x27;t do well freshman year, it&#x27;s really hard to get back from that.”Nayeli Vicente, Washburn High SchoolNayeli Vicente is an incoming ninth-grader at Washburn High School in Minneapolis.Gretchen Brown | MPR NewsNayeli Vicente remembers what it’s like to feel out of place. Back in elementary school, she was placed in classes with people who only spoke English. They looked different than she did, spoke differently.Nayeli, who grew up speaking Spanish at home, didn’t feel like her English was good enough. This time around, she knows support is available, though she’s still nervous to be in a new environment. Her cousins attend Washburn High School. They can help her out if she gets lost.“I try to be nice to people, like nicer than usual,” she said. “And I know I can still relate to other people who aren&#x27;t exactly like me.”Nayeli is excited to learn her fourth language this year, American Sign Language (she learned Arabic in middle school). And she’s hoping to do well in all her classes so she can earn a scholarship in the future — that seems like the dream.“I&#x27;m going to get a career in the future that has to do with science and mathematics. Because I think those are my strong points in comparison to things like literature,” she said. “I&#x27;m excited about what this is going to bring for me. I&#x27;m very nervous about how I&#x27;m going to be able to achieve certain things.”Click the audio player above to listen to the full episode. Subscribe to the Minnesota Now podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.  We attempt to make transcripts for Minnesota Now available the next business day after a broadcast.

His spot on the roster will go to journeyman infielder Deven Marrero, whose previously reported selection from Triple-A has now been made official. New York also recalled right-hander Adonis Medina as the second of their two September call-ups.\nGrey, 28, hasn&#8217;t pitched in the Majors to this point in his career but was added to the Mets&#8217; 40-man roster last month amid a series of roster moves to get some fresh arms in the &#8217;pen. Grey has made 21 starts and a relief appearance in Triple-A Syracuse but struggled to a 5.52 ERA with lackluster strikeout and walk ratios (17.9% and 9.5%, respectively).\nOriginally a 20th-round pick by the D-backs in 2016, Grey posted solid numbers up through the Double-A level but has yielded an ERA north of 6.00 in parts of three Triple-A seasons. He&#8217;ll be placed on outright waivers or released within the week.\nMedina, 25, will give the Mets an extra arm in the bullpen. The former Phillies top prospect has appeared in 13 games with the Mets this season and tallied 23 1/3 innings while pitching to a 4.63 ERA. He&#8217;s logged a below-average 16.5% strikeout rate but also walked only 4.9% of his opponents in that small sample. Medina has a 3.71 ERA in 26 1/3 innings with Syracuse, though he&#8217;s walked a much more problematic 12.1% of his opponents there.",

        "description": "The Angels announced Thursday that outfielder Steven Duggar and infielder Jose Rojas have been designated for assignment. Their spots on the 40-man roster will go to outfielder Ryan Aguilar and righty Zack Weiss, both of whom have had their contract selected from Triple-A Salt Lake.\nDuggar, 28, was a sixth-rounder with the Giants back in 2015 and had some solid showings in San Francisco. He never established himself as a consistent presence in their outfield, however, in part due to injury troubles. Duggar suffered a torn labrum that required surgery in 2018, ending his rookie campaign. He avoided surgery on a second shoulder injury, sustained in August of 2019, but that issue still ended his season.\nDuggar received minimal playing time in the shortened 2020 season but returned with a career-best .257/.330/.437 batting line in 297 trips to the plate in 2021. That success hasn&#8217;t carried over to the current campaign, however. He&#8217;s appeared with three different teams this season and batted .153/.225/.222 in 80 trips to the plate. Duggar, who&#8217;s capable of playing all three outfield spots, has already been traded once and claimed off waivers this season, so it&#8217;s possible there&#8217;s another club out there who&#8217;ll be interested in carrying him on the 40-man roster once he hits waivers. That outcome is a formality at this point; he&#8217;s ineligible to be traded and thus will be placed on outright or release waivers in the coming week.\nRojas, 29, has appeared in 83 games with the Halos over the past two seasons but managed just a .188/.245/.339 batting line in 241 plate appearances. He&#8217;s a .277/.344/.524 hitter in parts of four Triple-A campaigns, however, and has a minor league option remaining beyond this year, which enhances his appeal. Rojas also has notable amounts of experience in both outfield corners and at every infield slot other than shortstop, although he doesn&#8217;t have strong defensive grades at any of those spots in mostly limited MLB action.\nAguilar, 28 later this month, made his big league debut this year as a replacement player during the Angels&#8217; series in Toronto. He&#8217;s in his first season with the Angels organization after spending his career in the Brewers system. Through 342 plate appearances of Double-A ball, he&#8217;s slashed .280/.427/.517 with 15 homers, 13 doubles, two triples and 11 steals.\nWeiss, 30, is also in his first season with the Angels organization. The former Reds farmhand signed a minor league deal in the offseason and has turned in 50 innings of 4.50 ERA ball with a 29.7% strikeout rate against a 9.6% walk rate. Weiss received an extremely brief cup of coffee  with the 2018 Reds but did not retire any of the four batters he faced (two walks, two home runs allowed). He&#8217;ll obviously hope for a shot at redemption four years after the fact.",

        "description": "The largest genetic analysis to date to understand the genetics behind autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions reveals 185 genes associated with autism, many for the first time.\nAutism spectrum disorder affects about 2% of children in the United States. While most cases are inherited, a small number are the result of rare genetic variations.\nThe study, published in Nature Genetics, examines the genomes of more than 150,000 participants. Of this group, 20,000 have been diagnosed with autism. The results offer the most comprehensive analysis of the diverse forms of genetic variation in autism and shed insight on the molecular roots of brain development and neurodiversity, presenting potential new lines of inquiry to understand the biology of autism.\n&#8220;With these findings we are beginning to understand how these genes and genetic variations exert their effects during neurodevelopment,&#8221; says co-senior author Kathryn Roeder, professor of statistics and life sciences in the statistics and data science department at Carnegie Mellon University.\nThis study benefits from new data analysis methods that focused on the sections of the protein-coding portions of the genome, called the exome. To reveal genetic variants associated with autism, the researchers analyzed exome sequencing data from the Autism Sequencing Consortium, the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research (SPARK) project, and the Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research.\nThis approach generated large volumes of data that were analyzed using cloud-based computing to identify changes that could be associated to genetic variations linked to autism.\n&#8220;Resources pooled together by this collaboration allowed us to extract information from genetic data more efficiently and to start teasing apart the relationship between autism and other developmental disabilities, bringing us closer to understanding the fundamental neurobiology of autism,&#8221; says co-senior author Bernie Devlin, professor of psychiatry and clinical and translational science at the University of Pittsburgh.\nThe team identified 185 genes that are significantly associated with autism. Many of the variants were new and not inherited from the parents. The variations resulted from the loss of one copy of a gene, the change in the spelling of a gene, or duplicate copies that could all alter a gene&#8217;s function.\nThe researchers compared the newly identified autism variants to a large dataset of 31,000 families in which one child has been diagnosed with developmental delay and/or other neurodevelopmental conditions. They found a great deal of overlap between the newly identified genes and other conditions associated with developmental delay.\nIn this study, Roeder focused on the expression of the gene in the developing human neurons. She determined genes linked predominantly to developmental delay tend to be active in early neuronal development. Conversely, autism-related genes tend to play a role in more mature neurons.\nIn addition, the team found the subset of genes that are more strongly tied to autism show some overlap with genes uncovered in an earlier study of schizophrenia. This result suggests a possible shared biological pathways underlying the two conditions.\nWith new data expected soon from the SPARK project and plans to analyze whole-genome data that includes both coding and noncoding sequences, the scientists hope to fill out a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of autism and related conditions.\n&#8220;This is just the first discovery step,&#8221; says co-first author Harrison Brand, an assistant professor in neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. &#8220;Now that we have this list of high-confidence genes, we can take it to the functional modeling stage to explore the biological mechanisms that underlie the features of autism.&#8221;\nAdditional coauthors are from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the University of California, San Francisco.\nThe Simons Foundation for Autism Research Initiative, including the SSC-ASC Genomics Consortium and the SPARK project; the National Human Genome Research Institute; the National Institute of Mental Health; the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; and the Seaver Foundation funded the work.\nSource: Carnegie Mellon University\nThe post Team identifies more genes linked to autism appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Goldman Sachs says home sales have taken a larger dip than previously reported, a trend experts say could continue further into the year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResearchers said in the new report that new and existing home sales saw a nearly 30 percent drop from the peak seen in October 2020 amid higher mortgage rates and a reversal in what was described as several “pandemic-related preference shifts.”\n\n\n\nDuring the pandemic, the nation saw a boom in household formation and demand for second homes, researchers noted. But they added that multiple areas that once saw “outsized increases in home sales and building permits in 2020 and 2021” are currently seeing disproportionate declines.\n\n\n\n“The outlook for demand continues to benefit from a tight labor market and a continued demographic tailwind from millennials passing through their prime home-buying years,” they wrote.\n\n\n\nResearchers say home sales could fall even further in the months ahead due to multiple factors, including what they listed as a “sustained reduction in affordability, waning pandemic tailwind, and recent decline in purchasing intentions.”\n\n\n\nAt the same time, researchers say supply of existing homes is “well below pre-pandemic levels.”\n\n\n\n“The outlook continues to offer no quick fixes for the housing shortage, and the roughly 10 percent reduction in building permits from the peak, 20 percent reduction in housing starts, and delayed completion times for new homes are likely to keep supply constrained through at least the end of next year,” they write.\n\n\n\nA model included in the report forecasts a potentially sharp slowdown for home price growth in the coming quarters and for “home prices to be flat” next year, as what researchers described as a current imbalance between supply and demand levels out.\n\n\n\nResearchers said housing downturns have often gone hand-in-hand with economic recessions in the past, which they note “led to an influx of housing supply as unemployment rose and individuals were forced to sell their homes.”\n\n\n\n“However, an influx of supply from this channel seems unlikely this cycle: the labor market remains robust (and likely will, even in a mild recession) and, as we wrote last week, household balance sheets are extremely strong and loan delinquency rates are likely to remain historically low,” they added.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/3624359-joe-biden-wants-to-have-it-both-ways-on-crime-and-policing/",
        "description": "Joe Biden wants to rewrite history.\n\n\n\nJust recently, the president traveled to Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and gave a speech trying to convince voters that – suddenly, magically, overnight – he’s become very, very concerned about crime. That he and his Democratic colleagues are pro-police, despite what you might have heard and seen over the past several years.\n\n\n\nBiden unveiled his “Safer America Plan,” hoping voters will forget Democrats’ many policies that have made America distinctly unsafe. Looking at data from 23 cities, homicides for the first half of 2022 jumped 39 percent from the same time in 2019, before the George Floyd protests changed everything. Robberies were 19 percent higher.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s sudden “super cop” persona is utter hogwash. It is a fiction driven by Democrats’ very real concern that they are being blamed for the crime spike horrifying much of the nation.\n\n\n\nPolling shows crime to be one of voters’ top concerns this year, and Biden’s approval rating on the issue is one of his worst. According to a recent CBS poll, some 58 percent of Americans disapprove of his handling of the issue, while 42 percent approve. More importantly, 92 percent of respondents said that crime would be either very (67 percent) or somewhat (25 percent) important to how they will vote in the upcoming midterm elections.\n\n\n\nIs it any wonder that Biden gets low marks on crime? This is the president who has said there is “absolutely” systemic racism in law enforcement and who ran for president promising to “Expand and use the power of the U.S. Justice Department to address systemic misconduct in police departments and prosecutors’ offices.”\n\n\n\nBiden also ran for the Oval Office promising to “end cash bail,” an approach that is causing crime to soar in Democrat-led cities, where even violent offenders are released back onto the streets to commit more crimes.\n\n\n\nJust recently in New York, an ex-con who sucker-punched and nearly killed a complete stranger was initially released without bail after his charges were downgraded to misdemeanors, despite the vicious attack being recorded on film and available to prosecutors. Thankfully, he eventually ended up behind bars.\n\n\n\nEvery day such offenses are reported, as average citizens wonder what has happened to common sense, and why they no longer feel safe.\n\n\n\nIt isn’t just homicides that are out of control. Voters are appalled by images of criminals sauntering out of stores carrying armloads of expensive items, while security guards stand idly by, afraid of being prosecuted by district attorneys more concerned about the rights of criminals than of victims.\n\n\n\nShoppers find everyday items in their local CVS stores under lock and key, put there by managers frustrated by the insolent crowd causally ransacking the shelves while calls to local law enforcement prove futile. Cops fear getting involved, especially since most of those arrested will be released within hours.\n\n\n\nThis slide into lawlessness took root during the summer of 2020, after the murder of George Floyd. Unruly crowds burned down buildings, looted stores and attacked cops in cities like Minneapolis and Seattle and mostly went unpunished. Democratic lawmakers and media types excused the violence that killed innocent bystanders and cost tens of billions of dollars in damages, refusing to step in and denounce the criminals taking advantage of the situation.\n\n\n\nBiden, running for president, proposed restrictions on cops that would make their job harder. While mildly denouncing violence, Biden commended those protesting Floyd’s murder, which he described as a “wake-up call for our nation.” But he also said it was unacceptable “for our police… to escalate tensions or resort to excessive violence.” In other words, it was mostly the cops who were at fault.\n\n\n\nBiden continues to walk that same line today, trying to sound tough on crime even as he appeases progressives who think cops are racist and that even murderers should be given a second, third, or, really, an infinite number of chances at rehabilitation.\n\n\n\nBut today Biden is president. It is he who has set the permissive tone undermining the country’s security. Look no further than the breakdown of the rule of law at the southern border, where the Biden administration has encouraged an unparalleled surge in illegal immigration into our country. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe president’s hypocrisy is breathtaking. In his speech in Pennsylvania, he denounced the “opioid epidemic” and specifically calls out drugs that have been “laced with fentanyl.” He skips right over the part where cracking down on drug overdoses also means closing the southern border, where most of that deadly drug enters the country. He fails to mention that in his first year as president, fentanyl-related deaths jumped 23 percent and that the deadly drug is now the number one cause of deaths among young people.\n\n\n\nBiden wants it both ways. He says he’s “opposed to defunding the police” but also placates his progressive base by insisting that rules eliminating chokeholds and restricting no-knock warrants should be imposed nationwide.\n\n\n\nNone of what Biden offers will solve rampant crime in cities like New York and Chicago. We need to return to “broken windows” law enforcement, which works. But the president does not dare offend progressives in his party.\n\n\n\nBiden closed his speech by confusing who was running for which office in Pennsylvania, a key swing state. Here are his words, from the White House transcript:\n\n\n\n\"But think about doing me a favor. Please, please elect the attorney general to the Senate  [to be governor]. (Applause.) Elect that big ol’ boy to be governor  [senator].”\n\n\n\nNow do you feel more secure?\n\n\n\nLiz Peek is a former partner of major bracket Wall Street firm Wertheim &amp; Company.

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData collected during the 2020 presidential election show the majority of local election offices in the United States did not have a social media presence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is concerning, as young individuals — who use social media the most — tend to face registration and voting hurdles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers suggest increased utilization of certain platforms by local election offices could help young voters better navigate the voting process.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the 2022 midterm elections looming, many campaigns are in full-swing trying to connect with voters. But at the local level, a lack of information about the voting process may inhibit some from participating, while a new report suggests these barriers could be exacerbated by a low presence of local election offices on social media.\n\n\n\nAccording to research conducted on the 2020 election, the majority of local election offices throughout the country do not have a social media presence beyond that of Facebook, and for those that do, chances are candidates are not effectively reaching their audience, authors wrote. \n\n\n\nBecause younger adults have been moving away from Facebook as their preferred social media platform, the findings suggest these local offices might be missing a large swath of younger voters with their election information.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrevious research conducted by the report’s authors documented the positive effect social media can have on voters of all ages. In particular, their work shows that young voters are more likely to register to vote, cast ballots and have their ballots counted when local election officials have and use their social media accounts to distribute voting information. \n\n\n\nThe current analysis reveals most offices are not on Facebook or Twitter.\n\n\n\nIn addition, few are on both Facebook and Twitter, while some use only one of the platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEight states, Alaska, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin, were excluded from the analysis as elections are run by municipal officials not county staff.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCalifornia and Florida both had relatively large proportions of county election offices on both platforms surveyed, along with Ohio and Maryland. Several states including Oregon, Montana, South Dakota, Mississippi and others had no offices using both platforms. In North Dakota, no local election offices used social media in 2020.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt the time, just half of voters between the ages 18 and 29 voted in the presidential election, marking an 11-point increase from 2016 rates. \n\n\n\nHowever, rates among this cohort continue to lag behind older voters, researchers explained.\n\n\n\n“Even when they do try to vote, young voters face more barriers to participation than more experienced voters. They are more likely than older people to make errors or omissions on their voter registration applications and therefore not be successfully registered.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome of these issues may arise thanks to confusion around voter eligibility requirements under state election laws, while social media poses a potential solution to this challenge.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, the platforms these offices use to distribute information will be instrumental, as more young individuals report a preference for Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and SnapChat over Facebook and Twitter, researchers explained. \n\n\n\nThe primary method local offices use to distribute voting information is through their own government websites. \n\n\n\n“But young voters’ regular use of social media presents an opportunity for officials to be more active and engaged on those sites,” authors wrote.\n\n\n\n“While many election officials around the country face budget and staffing pressures, as well as threats to their safety, our research confirms that when officials do get involved on social media, young voters benefit – as does democracy itself,” they concluded.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n More than 150,000 residents in Jackson are without clean tap water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main water treatment facility for the city of Jackson, the O.B. Curtis Water Plant, failed in recent days following flooding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials are currently scrambling to restore access to safe drinking water, distributing bottled water to hundreds of thousands, as it’s not clear when regular water service will return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMississippi’s capital city is in the midst of a water crisis as recent torrential rain coupled with existing water infrastructure problems has cut off access to clean drinking water for most of the city’s residents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe main water treatment facility for the city of Jackson, the O.B. Curtis Water Plant, failed in recent days, leaving residents with little to no reliably clean drinking or running water due to possible contamination and lack of pressure for days. City officials said areas in Jackson now have some pressure.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe crisis kicked off late last week after days of heavy rain caused the Pearl River to flood and disrupt treatment processes at the plant. State leaders have urged residents to avoid drinking tap water, and are distributing bottled drinking water and non-potable water to replace running water. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblems with the city’s water system, however, have been ongoing for years. The Environmental Protection Agency issued a Safe Drinking Water Act Emergency Administrative Order for the facility in 2020 after identifying compliance and maintenance deficiencies. Last year, some residents were left without water for several weeks due to a system-wide failure caused by freezing temperatures. Since July, city residents have been under a boil water advisory due to elevated chances water may contain “disease-causing organisms.”\n\n\n\nPresident Biden on Tuesday declared an emergency in the state to free up federal resources to respond to the disaster. Officials are currently scrambling to restore access to safe drinking water, and Jackson Mayor Chowke Antar Lumumba said he’s optimistic drinking water will return this week.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow does flooding disrupt water systems?\n\n\n\nFloods are the most common type of natural disaster in the U.S. and pose a significant threat to water systems by damaging crucial infrastructure and contaminating supply.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf excess stormwater manages to penetrate contained areas of a treatment facility, which is more likely to be the case in aging, deteriorating treatment plants, it can cause a range of issues, such as pumping failures, erosion and leakage into pipes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s a major problem when floodwaters actually get into the protected area of one of these plants,” Aaron Packman, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Northwestern University, told Changing America.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“You can think about the need to pump water. If none of your pumps work, how do you pump out all that flood water that has gotten into your building, your basement, your utility rooms?”\n\n\n\nIn Jackson, pump failures left the water system without enough water or water pressure to move through city pipes. An emergency rental pump was installed at Jackson’s O.B. Curtis water-treatment plant Wednesday, restoring some pressure to some areas.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs floodwaters wash over areas of land that are typically dry, they collect pollutants such as soil, pesticides, oil, heavy metals, raw sewage and others. Contaminants then travel in high volume in floodwaters that can inundate drinking water wells or city water systems for days or weeks. Additionally, excess water makes it much more difficult for water treatment facilities to effectively treat water.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf water sources or parts of water distribution systems flood, hazardous contaminants that can cause serious illness may find their way into residents' taps. Direct contact with flood water can cause gastrointestinal infections due to the prevalence of bacteria, viruses and parasites.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The threat or damage to the treatment facility, the pumping failures and the contamination that goes with flooding are all a big part of the problem,” Packman said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Most waterborne disease outbreaks occur during extremes of water, mainly floods, but also droughts.”",

activist Ginni Thomas, the spouse of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, reportedly pressured several Wisconsin lawmakers to change the 2020 election results in the state, according to emails obtained by both The Washington Post and CBS News.\n\n\n\nGinni Thomas reportedly reached out to the chair of the Wisconsin Senate Elections Committee, state Sen. Kathy Bernier (R), and state Rep. Gary Tauchen (R). In emails sent to both lawmakers through the FreeRoots platform on Nov. 9, 2020, she said, “Please stand strong in the face of media and political pressure,” according to the Post, which obtained both emails through a public records request.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Post obtained Thomas's email to Tauchen from the Documented watchdog group.\n\n\n\n“Please reflect on the awesome authority granted to you by our Constitution. And then please take action to ensure that a clean slate of Electors is chosen for our state,” Thomas reportedly told them.\n\n\n\nThe reporting comes several months after separate reporting showed that Thomas had reached out to nearly 30 Arizona state lawmakers to also press them to overturn the 2020 election results in the state, which Biden won as well. Thomas has not been formally subpoenaed by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, but members are considering doing so.\n\n\n\nA Supreme Court spokesperson, Thomas and Thomas's lawyer did not return requests for comment from the Post. Neither did Tauchen.\n\n\n\nBernier defended Thomas, telling the newspaper that the conservative activist “has a First Amendment right to speak her mind,” while also acknowledging she did not know the Supreme Court justice’s wife had emailed her following the last election.\n\n\n\nHad voter fraud been found, Bernier told the Post they could have taken steps to decertify the election but said that no evidence of wrongdoing was ultimately found following the legal challenges.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Thomas, her lawyer, a spokesperson for the Supreme Court and both Wisconsin state lawmakers for comment.",

        "description": "Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly (D) placed the state’s first legal sports bet on Thursday, wagering $15 that the Kansas City Chiefs will win the Super Bowl this year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKelly tweeted that she placed the bet at the Hollywood Casino in Kansas City, Kan. \n\n\n\n“Let’s just say that I’m really hoping the @Chiefs win the Super Bowl this season — even more than usual,” she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Kansas City Star’s Aarón Torres reported that the $15 bet was in honor of the jersey number of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. He said the odds on the bet were 10-1. \n\n\n\nKelly said in remarks at the casino that she has heard from Kansans across the state every day that they were “counting down the hours” until they can legally wager on sports and that she is “so glad” the moment has come. \n\n\n\nKelly signed bipartisan legislation making sports betting legal in the state in May and announced last month that the betting would begin on Sept. 1, just in time for the start of the NFL season, the Kansas City Star reported. \n\n\n\nKelly is in the midst of what is expected to be a tough reelection campaign against Republican state Attorney General Derek Schmidt.\n\n\n\nKelly is the only incumbent Democratic governor running for reelection this year in a state that voted for former President Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Control of the governor’s mansion in Kansas has shifted back and forth between Republicans and Democrats over the past several decades. \n\n\n\nKelly has also expressed interest in luring the Chiefs out of Missouri and into Kansas, potentially offering economic incentives. The Star reported that the franchise's current lease at the Truman Sports Complex does not expire until 2031. \n\n\n\nChiefs President Mark Donovan has said that the team has considered “options” in Kansas. \n\n\n\nThe American Gaming Association reports that 30 states, plus Washington, D.C., have active, legal sports betting markets. The Supreme Court struck down a federal law banning sports betting in most states in 2018.",

        "description": "Sam Navarro-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Could the Astros gain some value on the margins to close out the season by utilizing a top prospect in a variety of ways?  One of my favorite months of the season is, ironically, September. For one, there is a bit more intrigue around the game as rosters expand. Strategy becomes a bit more complicated, which I enjoy for some reason. Although the rule changes in 2020 altered the strategy of September promotions, some of it warranted, it remains fun to see how the new faces are utilized. After all, the next thirty games or so offer glimpses into the future with a couple of top prospects making their debuts and a few feel-good stories about career minor leaguers finally reaching the big stage, which is part of the draw of the month for me. I am a sucker for a good story that tugs at the heartstrings. It also represents an ideal time to experiment, especially for contenders like the Astros, who are virtually guaranteed another postseason appearance at this juncture of the campaign. \nBut when I mention experiment, I do not necessarily mean anything considered radical. For example, I wouldn’t bench any regulars for an indefinite period for the sake of rest or needlessly tinker with positional versatility unless injuries were involved. An occasional off day here or there to help keep them fresh is fine, but too much rest feels counterproductive. After all, baseball players are creatures of habit and routine. While the goal is to remain as healthy as possible for the postseason, there is a balancing act to maintain with the roster at large. You’re not benching Jose Altuve to rest for ten days in September primarily to see what David Hensley could do at second base. But there is room for tinkering on the margins, primarily if an arm or a bat can provide some value for October. \nFrom what I can recall, the most famous example of a top prospect making an impact in September and that subsequent October was David Price when he made his debut for the Rays in 2008. While he didn’t start any games in the postseason, his performance — 1.59 ERA in 5 2⁄3 innings — was among the most interesting topics that year. Tampa Bay, an organization, long known to buck conventional wisdom, was rewarded with experimenting as Price did help the club advance to that season’s World Series. \nThe Astros in 2022 have a similar opportunity with their top pitching prospect Hunter Brown joining the active roster for September. The context was slightly different for the Rays with Price than for Houston with Brown, but the overall point feels relevant. Consider the next four weeks as a similar audition for the 24-year-old right-hander, who has continued to improve in his three minor league seasons dating back to 2019. With Sugar Land this year, Brown has posted a 2.55 ERA/3.30 FIP in 106 innings, which is impressive considering how the PCL is geared to benefit hitters more than pitchers. More important, however, is that Brown has also struck out over a third of all the batters he has faced this season. If it weren’t for the pitching depth on the active roster, those results would’ve promoted Brown to the Astros much earlier. \nFor September, I don’t envision Brown starting, at least in the traditional sense. Even if he does start a game or two, especially if the Astros want to maintain a six-man rotation in Justin Verlander’s absence, it would be more of an opener situation. More of a two- to three-inning start, if you will. For as much promise as he possesses, the only way Brown is starting an actual game in October is if something goes awry with injuries. Never say never, but the probability is extremely low. \nInstead, we will likely see Brown get some exposure in shorter spurts for the next four weeks for the Astros to fully determine if he could become a dependable option for the bullpen, especially with his swing-and-miss potential. Use him in various situations to gauge how he reacts and how his stuff looks up close. There is some precedent here as Bryan Abreu made the postseason roster in 2019 based on his swing-and-miss potential, even if it ultimately conveyed into one forgettable appearance. But there is value to gain from a pitcher who can reach the upper nineties with his fastball, like Brown, to give the Astros another advantage on the margins. Those gains on the margins in a close series could ultimately make all the difference between advancing or returning home earlier than expected.",

        "description": "Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Brewers are fighting for a Wild Card berth while the D-backs are hustling to reach .500 The 69-60  Milwaukee Brewers come to Chase Field to play the Diamondbacks in a four game series for Labor Day weekend.  Milwaukee is in 2nd place in the NL Central,  6 games back of the St. Louis Cardinals.  They also trail the Padres by 2.5 games  and the Phillies by 3  games in the wild card race. \nMilwaukee is 6-4 in their last ten having just taken two of three from the Pirates, but were just 11-15 for the month of August, losing their grip on a playoff spot in the process. \nThey have a 105 team OPS+.  They’re 2nd in the NL in home runs but 11th in batting average.  It’s a balanced lineup with 6 starters between 109-129 OPS+, lead by Hunter Renfroe.  Christian Yellich is no longer an MVP candidate level player, batting .261 with 11 homers. \nOn the pitching side they have a team 105 ERA+, on the strength of their starting pitching, the best of which the D-backs will see this series. Devin “Air Bender” Williams is closing since Josh Hader was traded to San Diego for Taylor Rogers and others. \nThe Brewers are an above average defensive team, ranking  8th in MLB with +36 rDRS, two slots ahead of the D-backs who are +32. \nThe  61-68 Diamondbacks have been energized by their core of young rookies and second and third year players.  Despite dropping the series finale to the Phillies in an ugly fashion, losting 18-2, thus snapping a 5 game win streak, there are a lot of reasons for optimism in the desert. Top prospect Corbin Carroll was promoted this week and made an immediate impact his first two games. Jake McCarthy has been red hot, as has Daulton Varsho.  Alek Thomas has been up and down at the plate but hasn’t taken his issues to the outfield where he keeps making highlight reel plays.  The group is running with abandon on the base paths and in the outfield,  and overall the team bats have started to come around. While they still rank 13th in the NL in batting average, their .231 mark is a noted improvement from earlier in the year. The team OPS+ is up to 96.  A lot of that is due to veteran first baseman Christian Walker who is having the best month of his career, batting .340 with 7 HR and a 1.034 OPS.\nThe bullpen remains a sore spot, prone to late inning meltdowns one night and shut down innings the next. \nStarting Pitching Matchups\nThursday September 1, 6:40 P.M.\nRHP Brandon Woodruff, 9-3, 3.31 ERA/3.22 FIP vs. RHP Merrill Kelly, 11-5, 2.97 ERA/3.19 FIP\nWoodruff went on the IL with an Ankle injury on May 28th with a 4.74 ERA. He came back on June 28th and since then in 11 starts  he’s 4-0 with a 2.35 ERA. \nKelly began each of his last two starts allowing three runs in the  first inning before settling down. He’ll hope to get off to a better start in this one. \nFriday Sept 2, 6:40 P.M.\nLHP Eric Lauer, 10-5, 3.58 ERA/4.79 FIP vs. RHP Zach Davies, 2-4, 3.82 ERA/4.55 FIP\nLauer had a 2.38 ERA on June 5th, but went through a rough patch before settling back down. His FIP is so much higher than his ERA due to 25 HR allowed in in 136 IP.  He’s had trouble with walks lately, issuing 23 in his last 46 innings.\nDavies is on a solid run of starts, going 5 IP or more each of his last 5 GS, posting a 2.39 ERA in 26.1 IP . He doesn’t wow you with his stuff, but he’s not walking many batters and has been getting a lot of ball in play outs. \nSaturday Sept 3, 5:10 P.M. \nRH Corbin Burnes 9-6, 2.84 ERA/3.24 FIP vs. LH Madison Bumgarner 6-13, 4.87 ERA/4.70 FIP\nBurnes is having a very good season, albeit not as good as his Cy Young campaign from 2021.  K’s are down slightly, walks are up a little, but the biggest difference is the HR rate, which has gone from 0.4 HR/9 to 1.1 HR/9.  Still a tough customer any time he takes the mound. \nBumgarner’s FIP is finally lower than his ERA, and not in a good way. Much ink has been spilled dissecting his decline. The bottom line is if he does not turn it around very soon, perhaps as soon as this start, he could be removed from the rotation. \nSunday, Sept 4, 1:10 P.M.\nRHP Jason Alexander. 2-1, 4.97 ERA/4.81 FIP vs. RHP Zac Gallen  10-2, 2.53 ERA/3.17 FIP\nWith 8 starts and 7 relief appearances,  rookie pitcher Alexander has been moved in and out of the rotation and up and down between AAA and the majors.  He’s sinker-slider guy with a low 90’s two seamer. He throws a lot of changeups against left hand batters as well.  He has a high 54% ground ball rate. \nZac Gallen has thrown 34 1⁄3 consecutive scoreless innings, and is just 7 2⁄3 shy of Brandon Webb’s franchise record 42. He has finally emerged as the true ace of the staff.  This article was written on Wednesday night. I assume by Friday it will be announced that he won the pitcher of the month award. \nIt should be a good competitive series, and I’m looking forward to watching it. \nA Personal Note:\nThis is my last article for AZSnakepit. I have been presented with an opportunity that I must pursue and that necessitates me stepping away from writing here. There isn’t enough word count to thank Jim properly for supporting me and providing a platform for me to contribute. It’s been a labor of love and I will forever be grateful. I’d also like to thank all my colleagues and all the site members and readers.  We’ve had so much fun together and will continue to do so. I’m not disappearing and will still come around to comment and converse.  You’re not getting rid of me that easy. :)",

        "description": "Photo by John E. Moore III/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The future is now... August results\nJuly was not a good month for the team, and this factored into the numbers from the start of August. The team went 11-14, which was an improvement over June’s 9-16, but still short of expectations, especially considering a relatively soft schedule. The Dallas Keuchel experiment proved a complete disaster, and the team was also relatively inactive at the trade deadline, though did ship off David Peralta and Luke Weaver. The draft did bring in Druw Jones, but this does not appear to have made much difference. Here are the numbers from the August poll\n\n37% - 1 (not confident in the slightest)\n14% - 2\n10% - 3\n16% - 4\n11% - 5\n7% - 6\n3% - 7\n1% - 8\n0% - 9 (very, very, VERY confident)\n\nThat’s a sharp downturn at the bottom end, with “1” almost doubling, going from 20% to 37%. Most of that increase seemed to come from the “3” category, which dropped an almost equal amount, going from 25% to 10%. Oddly though, there was a slight increase in the upper half of confidence, with those voting “6” or better actually increasing slightly, from 8% to 11%. Those must be the Druw Jones fans... Still, it was not enough to counter the drop elsewhere, and consequently the average declined back below three, going from 3.29 to 2.90. That is the lowest it has been since the beginning of March. \nBelow, you can see the breakdown for the past 12 polls’ results, followed by the line graph showing the trends over this and previous seasons. \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nSeptember poll\nAugust has actually been a pleasant surprise. At the time of writing (as we head into the Phillies series), the team is above .500 at 14-11, and has outscored its opponents by 15 runs, the first time they’ve done both for a full calendar month since April 2021. The young outfield is beginning to come together nicely, and the team’s top prospect Corbin Carroll is now on the roster. However, the bullpen still remains a cause for concern, as does Madison Bumgarner, and the schedule in September is just brutal, with a lot of games against likely post-season opponents. The hoped-for improvement on last year of +20 games is by no means certain.\nBut what do you reckon? As ever, feel free to explain your choice in the comments, especially if it has changed from the previous one.",

        "description": "Photo by Joe Sargent/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Braves played at a 104-win pace in August despite two of their longest losing streaks of the year With most of the 2022 season in the books, my feelings regarding the effect the new expanded playoff format has had on the proceedings are unsettled. The Braves’ playoff odds hit 90 percent on June 30; they haven’t been lower than 94 percent since. In the NL as a whole, there aren’t really “races” but for seeing whether the Brewers can knock the Phillies or Padres out of the final playoff spot. Probably the most relevant “race” is whether the Braves can overtake the Mets, thus likely grabbing a first-round playoff bye. So, the season’s kind of weird: the Braves are simultaneously just playing out the string, as they have been for over a month now, while also engaged in probably the most exciting “chase” in the NL. This is not my preferred postseason format, to say the least.\nIn any case, mixed feelings about just how interesting the remainder of the season will be aside, the Braves had a weird but ultimately successful August. They struggled at the beginning a bit, and they struggled at the end a bit, but still reeled off an 18-10 mark (that’s a 104-win pace over the course of a season). They didn’t make any hay in the division, as they’re still three games back, but they also trailed in the division by seven games mid-month, so it’s been a bit of a hodgepodge of activity and non-activity in that regard. The Braves have now trailed in the division by 3.5 or 3.0 games at the end of each of the last three calendar months.\nThe Braves lost just two series all month. Unfortunately, one involved losing four of five to the Mets, without which, the division race would look pretty different. Still, at the end of July, the Braves had added about four wins to their preseason expectation. Now, at the end of August, they’re up to six extra wins. It’s hard to fault them, really. They’re slightly outperforming WAR-wins (by a game) and slightly underperforming BaseRuns (by a game). It’s hard to look at this team and say, “Hey y’all, do more.” \n  \n        \n  \nBy matchup win probability, the Braves should’ve gone 15-13 or 16-12 in August. They did much better, at 18-10. They were favored in 19 games and went 15-4 in them; they were disfavored in nine games and went 3-6. And yet, they lost a Max Fried-Jose Urena matchup, their most favorable on-paper game so far this season. You probably want to feel at least a little disappointed. I can’t tell you that you shouldn’t; I can only tell you that in the big picture, they’re exceeding central expectations anyway.\nLike in July, the Braves won in August due to something akin to combined arms. They didn’t really light the world on fire the way they did with superlative performance from their pitchers in June.\n\nThe Braves finished August third in wRC+, 19th in team defensive value, and fourth overall in position player fWAR. \nThe Braves finished August 13th in pitching fWAR, including 11th in the rotation and 22nd in the bullpen. That makes it two straight months of mediocre-or-worse relief pitching, after blowing most/all of the league of the water in that regard in the first three months of the year. \nFor the season as a whole, the Braves rank eighth in position player fWAR and fourth in pitching fWAR.\n\nThere were a lot of individual performances to talk about in August. Let’s dig in.\n\nTotally Meaningless Ivan Award for August 2022 Performance - Position Players\nAbout two months after he was called up from Double-A, Michael Harris II apparently decided to carry his teammates on his back throughout August. Harris led the team in fWAR with 1.6, which happens to be a top-10 mark in baseball for the month. He put together a 173 wRC+ to go with his neat defense, and while sure, there was some xwOBA outperformance in there, his xwOBA itself was still a fantastic .387. In fact, after back-to-back months of a .330s xwOBA, Harris really hit another gear in August, in part by reining in some of the errant chases and taking walks. There’s probably something to be looked at further with some declining contact quality in August, but we can save that for a full-season review at a later point.\nProduction aside, what was really superb from the team’s perspective was that Money Mike, in August, was, well... money. His WPA for the month? 1.46. The team’s offensive WPA for August? 1.84. No other Braves hitter had more than 0.35 WPA. There was a six-game stretch in August where Harris added 10 percent win probability or more in four of the games. He later put up a combined 36 percent addition in back-to-back games against the Pirates. What does he have in store for September? Hopefully something awesome.\nTotally Meaningless Ivan Award for August 2022 Performance - Starting Pitchers\nSpencer Strider was his old-but-come-on-he’s-only-been-doing-this-for-a-few-months-so-it’s-not-old-at-all-even-if-it-feels-like-he’s-been-doing-this-for-years dominant self in August, compiling 1.0 fWAR, which put him just outside the top 10 in MLB in that regard. But, as great as Strider was and is, I want to highlight someone who only compiled 0.4 fWAR: Kyle Wright.\nWright made five starts in August, and though his monthly slash is 61/100/75, it is dented heavily by the fact that the Mets clobbered him for four homers on August 4. That clobbering came, in large part, due to a curveball that lost a bunch of its signature horizontal break, something that made it work so well when paired with his sinker earlier in the year.\n  \n        \n  \nFor some hurlers, losing critical motion on a critical pitch down the stretch could’ve posed an insurmountable challenge, perhaps even doubly so when a late-season velocity dip also occurs shortly thereafter. But Wright adjusted: while the extra horizontal motion hasn’t really come back, he may have sped up his curveball, and altered to location to nip the edge rather than sweeping it across the plate as he did previously. As a result, he bounced back from that New York shelling with four great starts, including one at Fenway where his velocity was way down. That’s pretty cool. I mean, Strider just blowing dudes away all the time is also cool, but we can have room for different types of coolness in our lives.\nTotally Meaningless Ivan Award for August 2022 Performance - Relief Pitchers\nHonestly, this was not a great month for a relief corps that suffered multiple costly implosions. So, that gives me a chance to point out that hey, Tyler Matzek is still on this team.\nThe 2022 version of Matzek has basically existed to serve as yet another cautionary tale about relievers. Matzek was unbelievably dominant across about 40 combined regular and postseason innings in 2020, was very good again in 2021, and basically ate everyone’s face in the 2021 postseason. Come 2022, though, the best you can say about him is that, well, he’s a reliever. On the year, Matzek has 0.0 fWAR and a 73/105/134 line that would probably have gotten him demoted multiple times this season if he had options and/or lacked the past two seasons of spectacular work. In August, Matzek’s line is 42/87/141, which is... kind of better? Not really? He’s mostly been relegated to mop-up work, too, with just three high-leverage outings all year. But, in August, when faced with one in the 11th inning, he succeeded with flying colors, and that’s pretty cool. \n\nBest Offensive Play - Swanson turns the game around\nAfter two months of xwOBAs north of .370 in May and June, Swanson hasn’t done too much since, propping up his line with some xwOBA overperformance in July and really sliding down to a .300ish wOBA/xwOBA in August. Still, none of that mattered when he faced off against Ryan Helsley and turned a 2-0 deficit into a 3-2 lead with one swing.\n\n\n\n\nAn epic moment against one of the best relievers in baseball this year, who was somehow asked to come on and preserve the lead in the seventh. Unfortunately, the game went super-south for the Braves afterwards, but this was a super-cool moment in the month if you ignore most of the subsequent moments.\nBest Run-Stopping Play\nThis doesn’t happen much, but when you have the tying runs on base with none out, and you turn a double play that prevents a run from scoring, that’s... pretty great.\n\n\n\n\nNothing really spectacular here as Austin Riley just happened to be in the right position and Peyton Burdick was dead to rights at first, but a huge play on the defensive side nonetheless to bail Kyle Muller out of trouble.\nMost Dominant Single Game Offensive Performance\nOn August 9, Austin Riley had himself a day. He put the Braves on the board in the first with a triple. In the third, the Braves were now down 2-1, and he hit a two-run homer to turn their deficit into a lead. After a series of outs in the middle innings, he hit a two-run, game-winning single in the 11th.\n\n\n\n\nCome for Riley hitting his 30th dinger of the season over the Green Monster and out of Fenway Park, stay for Ronald Acuña Jr.’s awesome (and ultimately not needed) slide and Chip Caray saying “diving try” when the fielder does nothing of the sort on Riley’s triple.\nMost Dominant Single Game Starting Pitching Performance\nOn August 3, Charlie Morton made a scoreless game, and then a 1-0 lead, stand up for 6 2⁄3 innings against the Phillies. The end of that game was not great. The beginning and middle, though? Vintage Charlie Morton.\n\n\n\n\nHonestly, this wasn’t really Morton’s most dominant start of the month — what he did to the Mets on August 16 was way more disgusting, and even his start against his former team, the Astros, was better. But he had less margin of error in this one and faced a team whose power output comes into direct conflict with his struggles this year, but he bamboozled them anyway. Moreover, the 8/1 K/BB ratio came in a start that followed these self-same Phillies roughing him up in his prior outing, not to mention the other two times he faced them this season. Maybe not dominant in the statline, but a different kind of superlative performance.\nMost Dominant Relief Pitching Performance\nAfter Riley’s single above, Tyler Matzek came on in an apparently now-unfamiliar role, and slammed the door. With the tying run at the plate in each appearance due to the awful extra-inning rules, Matzek got a groundout and two strikeouts to seal the game and kick off what ended up being an eight-game winning streak in the middle of the month.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Crushed Dinger\nNot only did this tie the game, it was also an absolute moonshot. There goes Michael Harris II, carrying the team in August again.\n\n\n\n\nLike all months, August had its share of problems, too...\n\nWorst Offensive Result - Frustration summed up\nIn a World Series rematch game tied 1-1 in the eighth, the Braves had a golden opportunity to win the series as Rafael Montero walked the first two batters of the inning. After Dansby Swanson popped out, Riley had a chance to strike a big blow into the Astros’ chances... but he didn’t.\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, the Braves went on to win anyway.\nWorst Pitching Result - McHugh Meltdown\nRemember that outing above where Charlie Morton was great? What happened in the eighth inning was that Collin McHugh came on, and things went south. McHugh entered with a runner on first and one out. A single and a game-tying forceout later, Nick Castellanos came up, and gut-punched McHugh and the Braves:\n\n\n\n\nWorst Single-Game Offensive Performance\nIn addition to all of his other issues, Marcell Ozuna takes this one with his performance on August 9. Though the Braves won the game, thanks in large part to Riley and Matzek, Ozuna was brutal in this one. He went 0-for-5, including making the third out with runners at the corners in the third, and with two men on in a tie game in the seventh. In the tenth, with the free runner on second and none out, Ozuna flew out to start the frame, though Orlando Arcia was able to bail him out with an RBI double (and was injured on the play). \nWorst Single-Game Starting Pitching Performance\nAs already mentioned, this was Kyle Wright’s obliteration by the Mets on August 4. This was the start of a big series, and Wright allowed a homer to make it 2-0 in the second, two more homers in the third, and then a fourth homer after the Braves had scored three runs. He did last six frames, but when you allow as many homers as you collect strikeouts, that’s really really not great.\nWorst Single-Game Relief Pitching Performance\nIn probably the most obvious candidate given that it is likely going to be the worst Braves’ pitching performance of the year, we have Kenley Jansen on August 27. With a one-run lead, Jansen yielded a one-out double, a wild pitch, a walk, a hit-by-pitch in an 0-2 count, a game-tying RBI dribbler, and then a walkoff walk. \nMost Crushed Dinger Allowed\nKyle Wright’s cutter/slider thing: we are not huge fans, though Kyle Tucker clearly is.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee you next month!",

After recording many great songs of her own, in 2009 she made an album in which she performed a dozen songs from that list. She spoke with Terry Gross about that record.",

        "description": "The Guardians have designated right-hander Anthony Castro for assignment in order to open a spot on the 40-man roster for fellow righty Cody Morris, who&#8217;s been reinstated from the 60-day injured list, MLB.com&#8217;s Mandy Bell tweets. Infielder Ernie Clement has also been recalled from Triple-A Columbus.\nCastro, 27, was acquired in the Opening Day swap that sent outfielder Bradley Zimmer to Toronto. He appeared in a dozen games with Cleveland and posted a 7.43 ERA with a 12-to-10 K/BB ratio in 13 1/3 innings of relief. Castro averaged 95.2 mph on his heater and induced grounders at a 51.2% clip &#8212; both solid marks &#8212; but the bottom-line results and shaky command clearly weren&#8217;t encouraging. He&#8217;s notched a 3.94 ERA and an impressive 29.5% strikeout rate in 29 1/3 Triple-A innings this season but also posted a cringe-worthy 15.2% walk rate in that time.\nDating back to 2020, Castro has totaled 39 Major League innings between the Tigers, Blue Jays and Guardians but limped to a 6.00 ERA in that time. He throws hard and has missed plenty of bats in Triple-A, but command has long been an issue and Castro will be out of options in 2023. Cleveland will place him on outright waivers or release him within the next week.\nMorris, 25, likely would&#8217;ve made his MLB  debut by now were it not for a strained teres major muscle that shut him down back in Spring Training. Cleveland selected him to the 40-man roster back in November on the heels of a 2021 season that saw him log a sparkling 1.62 ERA and 93-to-20 K/BB ratio in 61 innings across three levels.\nThough he spent most of the season on the injured list, Morris has been able to go out on a minor league rehab assignment recently, and the results have been outstanding. He tossed three scoreless innings with nine strikeouts and no walks for the Guardians&#8217; Rookie-ball affiliate before jumping to Triple-A and holding opponents to four runs with a 30-to-6 K/BB ratio in 15 1/3 innings of work. Between the past two seasons, Morris has tallied 52 innings of Triple-A work with a 1.90 ERA, a massive 40.6% strikeout rate and an 8.9% walk rate.",

In advance of the 2020 election, President Trump almost tripled payouts to farm families to offset the pain of his trade war with China, from $11.5 billion in 2017 to $32 billion in 2020. But Biden’s college-debt-relief program is far larger than Trump’s handout to farmers, adding up to at least $330 billion over 10 years, and possibly as much as $1 trillion.&#8221;\n&#8220;The lesson for Republican leaders and donors is that sticking with Trump will be expensive. Trump himself and pro-Trump candidates are hurting the GOP’s election chances. Trump lost the presidency in 2020. Pro-Trump candidates cost the GOP its hold on the U.S. Senate in 2021. More pro-Trump candidates are slumping badly in 2022. More GOP stumbles mean more cash for Democratic constituencies.&#8221;",

        "description": "Photo by Maddie Malhotra/Boston Red Sox/Getty Images\n    \n\n  It’s September Call-Up Day! Let’s celebrate.  Happy September Call-Ups Day! This day isn’t nearly as festive as in years past, when fewer roster limitations essentially meant that the entire Pawtucket clubhouse could decamp to Fenway for a month, but it’s still kind of exciting.\nAs of now, there will be only be two new faces in the Sox dugout as the series against the Rangers opens up tonight. But recently promoted reliever Zack Kelly is expected to depart for paternity leave soon, and more DFAs will likely be coming, so expect more roster additions soon.\n  \n        \n      Photo by Mary DeCicco/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n  \nEduard Bazardo\nWhat Position Does He Play?\nRight-handed relief pitcher.\nIs He Any Good?\nWell, he’s 27-years-old (it’s his birthday today!) and he’s pitched a grand total of 3 innings in the major leagues. So generally speaking, no, he has not been very good. But, following the canceled 2020 season, he managed to add some velocity to his previously underwhelming fastball, which gave a jolt to his development. He’s still not a flamethrower, but he can hit 95 to go with a pretty effective slurve. \nWill He Be On The Team Next Year?\nMaybe? The entire bullpen is going to be in need of a pretty big overhaul, so its very likely that the next 33 days are effectively going to be an extended try-out for him. If he does well, he’ll be given every chance to make the team next spring. \nWhat’s He Doing In His Picture Up There?\nTipping his cap and saying “My pleasure, ma’am” to a young, 1870’s-era schoolteacher after using his fastball to prevent her Conestoga wagon from careening over the edge of the ravine. \nIs He Kolten Wong’s Brother?\nWhat? No, of course he isn’t; his name isn’t even Wong. What a weird question. \n\n  \n        \n      Photo by Maddie Malhotra/Boston Red Sox/Getty Images\n  \nConnor Wong\nWhat Position Does He Play?\nCatcher, but he’s also filled-in at second and third occasionally. So in light of how much the current front office loves playing guys out of position, look for him to to be given a chance to win the center field job next spring. \nIs He Any Good?\nHe’s not bad! For a projected back-up catcher, that is. He plays solid if unspectacular defense, has a little bit of power in the bat, and runs a little better than most catchers. He has a bit too much swing-and-miss in his profile, though, and still has a tendency to chase pitches out of the zone. The good news, though, is that he’s currently playing better than he ever has. Since August 13, he’s slashed .368/.411/.838, with a ridiculous 9 homers in 16 games. We couldn’t have picked a better time to see what he can do for an extended stretch in the bigs. \nWill He Be On The Team Next Year?\nWell, that’s an interesting question. Both he and Reese McGuire have proven themselves worthy of a roster spot next year. . . but both as back-up catchers, not starters. So if they do both break camp with the team, then that’s not necessarily a great sign for production from the catcher’s spot. Catcher is absolutely a position that needs to be upgraded next year, but where does it sit in the pecking order when you also consider the need to fill the holes in right field, center field, first base, the top of the rotation, the entire bullpen, and, possibly, short stop?\nWhat’s He Doing In His Picture Up There?\nSpotting an alien space ship descending over Polar Park in the opening scene of a new John Cena movie. \nIs He Kolten Wong’s Brother?\nYe. .  wait! No! He’s not! For years I just assumed he was, because it seemed impossible that two people who both shared the name Wong as a surname, a fake suburban cowboy name as a first name, and a moderate amount of baseball skills wouldn’t be brothers. But, alas, they are not. They’re not even from the same continent, as Kolten grew up in Hawaii. Now that I know this, I actually hope that they’re enemies, like mortal enemies, like I hope that Connor has Kolten’s picture hanging up in his basement, and he lights a candle and goes down there every night, and he stares into Kolten’s dead eyes and kind of goes into a trance  and chants Wrong Wong! Wrong Wong! for a few minutes before he regains control of his mind, blows out the candle, and then goes back upstairs to heat up a Hot Pocket. That would be a fun little storyline when the Sox play the Brewers next year.",

        "description": "Despite the fact that we continue to have bad actor Chrome extensions pop up in the Web Store, Google has done a ton to mitigate it over the past year. From adding new requirements for how developers must use your data to adding a seal of approval for anyone who respects that data and doesn&#8217;t misuse or sell it, the Web Store is no longer the wild west it once was.\n\n\n\nHowever, today, McAfee Labs discovered that five malicious cookie stuffing extensions which have been installed over 1.4 million times are currently a danger to you and anyone else who still has them on their system.\n\n\n\nAn extension called &#8220;Netflix Party&#8221; &#8211; not to be confused with the real Netflix Party, as well as Netflix Party 2, FlipShope &#8211; Price Tracker Extension, Full Page Screenshot Capture &#8211; Screenshotting, and AutoBuy Flash Sales are all guilty of logging and stealing several personal details of any victim who may have installed them.\n\n\n\nYou can get a full breakdown of exactly how they scrape your data over on the McAfee blog where they go into the technical details, but what you need to know is that your country, city, zip code, precise location (really, the location of your device, but your device is commonly on your person or in your home), and more have been forwarded to the attackers as a .JSON file which allows these details to be read as plain text!\n\n\n\nSource: McAfee Blog\n\n\nHere are the culprits along with their extension ID. Each one has between 80,000 and 200,000 installs, which in and of itself is just mind-blowing. It doesn&#8217;t matter how much Google does to solve the issue of malicious extensions, because if a user doesn&#8217;t check the reviews, check the privacy practices and developer name of something before installing it, they will still find themselves victims of such attacks.\n\n\n\nNetflix Party &#8211; Extension ID: mmnbenehknklpbendgmgngeaignppnbeNetflix Party 2 &#8211; Extension ID: flijfnhifgdcbhglkneplegafminjnhnFlipShope &#x2013; Price Tracker Extension&#xA0;&#8211; Extension ID: adikhbfjdbjkhelbdnffogkobkekkkejFull Page Screenshot Capture &#x2013; Screenshotting &#8211; Extension ID: pojgkmkfincpdkdgjepkmdekcahmckjpAutoBuy Flash Sales &#8211; Extension ID: gbnahglfafmhaehbdmjedfhdmimjcbed\n\n\n\nAt this time, the &#8220;Full Page Screenshot&#8221; and &#8220;FlipShope&#8221; extensions are still able to be installed by unsuspecting users, but the Netflix Party ones have been removed from the Web Storey by Google.

        "description": "The Biden administration’s push to reach a&nbsp;new nuclear agreement&nbsp;with Iran is completely out of step with not only our own interests in the Middle East but also regional developments that are bypassing Washington. The White House risks eroding our already tenuous position in the region and undermining our credibility with regional allies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRather than pursuing a deal that was wrong then and even more wrong now, the administration should be deepening our partnerships in the region to contain and deter Iran.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOnly a few days ago, the United States&nbsp;launched&nbsp;strikes against Iran-backed militants in Syria — militants that attacked American forces in the region. Tehran is&nbsp;providing&nbsp;material support to Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine — support it will almost certainly expand in the face of the White House’s diplomatic efforts. Iran continues to be a hugely&nbsp;destabilizing&nbsp;factor in Iraq, as evidenced by the latest political crisis in Baghdad. Tehran also actively&nbsp;participated&nbsp;in joint naval exercises with Russia and China earlier this year — an alarming confluence of America’s adversaries at sea. And let’s not forget the recent plot by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to&nbsp;assassinate&nbsp;officials on American soil.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDespite all of this evidence to the contrary, the White House seems intent on repeating the mistakes of the past, even in the face of Iranian belligerence. Once again, the administration is looking to bypass congressional approval for a very flawed Iranian nuclear deal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action&nbsp;(JCPOA) reached by the Obama administration — many staffers of whom now work for Biden — required a level of institutional and willful blindness that defies belief. The Iranian regime has only seen an increase in its interest in sowing chaos, fomenting violence and destabilization across the region since it was approved.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe first agreement sought to impose restrictions on Tehran to prevent it from acquiring a nuclear weapon — the development of which would be extremely destabilizing for the region. A nuclear Iran will only serve to free up their efforts to destabilize and threaten allies in the region. In exchange for loose monitoring and verification, the signatories agreed to remove sanctions (sanctions imposed, mind you, for the Iran hostage crisis, its ballistic missile program and human rights violations, among other things) and weapons embargoes designed to limit its ability to engage in havoc in the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo get to this accord, the Obama administration had to ignore Tehran’s support of Syria’s murderous civil war, ignore Damascus’ use of chemical weapons, had to agree to give $1.7 billion in cash back to Tehran that the intelligence community knew would support its terrorist activities around the world and had to sacrifice critical clandestine efforts that were working to stop Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. The Obama administration had to ignore highway robbery to get a promise from Tehran that it had no long-term interest in following.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the background, developments in the Middle East are passing our country by. Over the last several years Middle Eastern countries have been establishing&nbsp;formal ties&nbsp;with Israel. Think about how significant that is — the kingdoms and countries of the Middle East are abandoning policies that sought to isolate Israel, and are in the preliminary steps of embracing the country as a stable and reliable partner.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Middle Eastern states are recognizing the strategic reality that a stable, democratic and prosperous Israel is a far safer bet and far better partner than a theocratic, authoritarian and aggressive Iran. Strategic interests and the threat Tehran poses — nuclear or otherwise — are making smart bedfellows. This shift also reflects concerns about the credibility of the United States’ commitment to the region and its security. President Barack Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq created conditions for the creation of the Islamic State, and President Joe Biden’s disastrous exodus from Afghanistan only reinforced questions as to whether America could be relied upon in a crisis. The Biden administration is only reinforcing these fears with its misguided policy on Iran&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis was a bad deal made in bad faith that gave Tehran a lot and got the West very little, regardless of how the administration tried to justify its success after the fact. It’s an agreement that should never have been made in the first place and withdrawing from it made sense, even if the way in which it was handled left much to be desired.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRather than pursue an agreement that will give Iran what it wants, the United States should be doubling down on embracing the changes in the region’s security and diplomatic architecture. Washington should be encouraging these developments wherever possible, supporting Israel and our Middle Eastern partners in this process politically, economically and with military advice and assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWashington needs to rethink its grand strategy and recognize that despite the White House’s best hopes and fervent dreams, it cannot abandon the Middle East. As evidenced by President Biden's hat-in-hand&nbsp;visit&nbsp;to the Saudi kingdom to beg for more oil. Even as the United States pivots to the Indo-Pacific and China, it must play a productive and constructive role in the region’s defense and diplomatic architecture. We can and must do both.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe region and the United States cannot afford a nuclear Tehran, but it also cannot afford to be left behind as these historic political and diplomatic developments take place — developments which are wholly in the United States’ interests&nbsp;—&nbsp;even if they come about because of America’s seeming lack of attention. If we fail to stay engaged, we risk having to respond to a more serious conflict in the region.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe best insurance for a safer and stable region won’t be a fatally flawed JCPOA 2. It will be a continued engagement with our Middle East allies looking to build a better future for the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMike Rogers served as the Republican representative in Congress for the 8th&nbsp;District of Michigan from 2000 until 2015, including as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee from 2011-2015. &nbsp;",

exacerbated existing problems with water infrastructure in Jackson, Miss., leaving the city with more than 150,000 residents without potable water to drink.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe most immediate cause of the problem was&nbsp;flooding from the city’s Pearl River&nbsp;that ran into the streets. This flooding caused issues at the city’s O.B. Curtis Water Plant&nbsp;on Monday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R) said in a Monday night press conference that the water treatment facility’s main pumps had been severely damaged, and that the facility was using smaller backup pumps.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe said that some front-line workers tried to hold the system together, but that the system was expected to eventually fail.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“That failure appears to have begun today,” Reeves said on Monday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba (D) said in a Tuesday press conference that the issues were caused by “a lack of pressure in the system … that was complicated by the flood waters that we received.”\n\n\n\nReeves said Monday that the situation meant that the city can’t produce enough water to fight fires or reliably flush toilets. Reeves also urged the public not to drink the water coming from their pipes, saying it was likely to be untreated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEmergency water bottles were distributed to residents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe flooding may have been the most proximate source of problems, but issues with the city’s water system have been long-standing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn February 2021, a winter storm caused similar issues in the city, and some people were without water for weeks. The same water treatment plant’s equipment&nbsp;froze up&nbsp;at that time because of the cold weather.&nbsp;The city also experienced&nbsp;water issues in November.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEven before that, in 2020, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) inspectors found a host of issues in the city’s water system including: a lack of clarity in the water; leaks and line breaks in the city’s water distribution system; broken and uncalibrated monitoring equipment at the O.B. Curtis plant; and inadequate staffing at both that plant and the city’s J.H. Fewell treatment plant. \n\n\n\nThe report also said that portions of the J.H. Fewell plant, which provides a smaller amount of the city’s water, are more than 100 years old and in a “general state of disrepair.”\n\n\n\nThe EPA further found that the city did not fully implement lead and copper monitoring requirements and also did not make efforts to replace its water service lines that are made from lead . There is no safe level of lead in drinking water, and lead exposure can damage children’s brains and nervous systems.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the Tuesday press conference, Lumumba described the city’s problems as long-standing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is a set of accumulated problems based on deferred maintenance that has not taken place over decades,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe issues, in a predominantly Black community, mirror past crises in communities of color. Most notably, Flint, Mich., experienced elevated lead levels after its water source was switched to the Flint River and the water wasn’t adequately treated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJackson was a majority white city in the first half of the 20th century, but by the 1980s, so-called white flight led to tens of thousands of white residents leaving for the suburbs. \n\n\n\nThe city, already located in one of the poorest states in the U.S., has seen its tax base dwindle and is far short of the revenues leaders say are necessary to fix outdated water infrastructure.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed last November includes $459 million for water improvements throughout the state, Lumumba&nbsp;has said&nbsp;the city would need at least $2 billion to fix its water infrastructure.",

        "description": "A New York woman was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly catfishing and extorting the CEO of an unnamed public company, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced.\n\n\n\nProsecutors said Sakoya Blackwood, 34, threatened to release sexually explicit photographs and communications involving the CEO, referred to as “Victim-1” in court documents, and threatened multiple other victims.\n\n\n\nBlackwood, who is from the Bronx in New York, is charged with making interstate communications with intent to extort, cyberstalking and extortion. \n\n\n\nThe charges each carry a maximum sentence of two, five and 20 years in prison, respectively, meaning Blackwood could face up to 27 total years in prison if convicted.\n\n\n\n“No one should have to fear public humiliation and financial loss from the release of personal, private information,” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“As alleged, Sakoya Blackwood created that very fear and sought to capitalize on it for her own personal gain,” he added. “I commend the victim for reporting this alleged criminal activity and encourage anyone else who believes they may have been a victim of this scheme to contact the FBI.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe DOJ said Blackwood used multiple online identities to target the CEO and other wealthy, high-profile men in the scheme.\n\n\n\nBlackwood allegedly sent “numerous” intimidating and threatening text messages to the CEO, also using threats of economic and reputational harm from the photos’ release in attempts to receive payment.\n\n\n\n\"Most people hope for a personal human connection in life, and scam artists twist that desire into illicit schemes to steal more than hearts,” FBI Assistant Director Michael Driscoll said in a statement.\n\n\n\n“We believe Blackwood used tactics we allege in this indictment to blackmail and extort money from other victims,” Driscoll continued. “We are asking those people to contact us so we can help them but also to ensure no one else ever falls victim to Blackwood's alleged deception.\"",

long-simmering tensions between Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), the chair of the GOP’s Senate campaign arm, are once again spilling out into the open, with a little over two months to go before the midterms.\n\n\n\nMcConnell — along with many other Republicans — has privately raised doubts for months about his party’s roster of Senate candidates and chances of recapturing control of the upper chamber in November. But with those concerns becoming increasingly apparent, Scott has begun to dig in his heels.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with Politico this week, the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman acknowledged a “strategic disagreement” with McConnell. On Thursday, Scott penned an op-ed for the Washington Examiner in which he accused “the very people responsible for losing the Senate last cycle” of “trash-talking our Republican candidates.”\n\n\n\n“If you want to talk about the need to raise more money to promote our candidates versus the Democrats’ terrible candidates, I agree. If you want to trash-talk our candidates to help the Democrats, pipe down,” Scott wrote. “That’s not what leaders do.”\n\n\n\nScott’s op-ed did not explicitly mention McConnell, a seasoned political operator known for taking a keen interest in his party’s approach to campaigning. But Scott’s message was unmistakable, coming just two weeks after McConnell downplayed the GOP’s prospects of recapturing control of the Senate and took a thinly veiled swipe at the quality of some of the party’s candidates.\n\n\n\n“I think there’s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate,” McConnell said during an appearance in his home state last month. “Senate races are just different. They're statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome.”\n\n\n\nMcConnell’s remarks were a public acknowledgment of a concern that has mostly been expressed in private by many Republicans. In some of the country’s most hotly contested Senate primaries, Republican voters have nominated largely untested candidates, who were endorsed by former President Donald Trump but have struggled to get their general election campaigns off the ground.\n\n\n\nIn Georgia, where Republicans are trying to take down Sen. Raphael Warnock (D), the GOP nominee Herschel Walker has had to fight off questions about his business record and personal life, including the revelation that he has three children he failed to previously acknowledge publicly despite railing against absentee fathers.\n\n\n\nLikewise, in Pennsylvania, polling has repeatedly shown celebrity physician Mehmet Oz, the Trump-backed Republican Senate nominee, trailing his Democratic rival, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. In Ohio, a state that has lurched to the right in recent years, some Republicans have been caught off guard by how competitive the race between Republican J.D. Vance and Democrat Tim Ryan has become.\n\n\n\nAnd in Arizona, the Senate Leadership Fund (SLF), a super PAC aligned with McConnell, cut roughly $8 million worth of ad reservations boosting Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe group’s president, Steven Law, said SLF is “leaving the door wide open in Arizona,” but wanted to reallocate money to other competitive races, as well as to make up for heavy spending in Ohio.\n\n\n\n“A lot of these people – they’re struggling,” said one Republican donor who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the party’s candidates candidly. “I think had the Republican Party been more in control, they would have nominated really electable candidates.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I still think, when it comes down to it, they can still win,” the donor added. “But if they lose, it’s going to be their own damn fault.”\n\n\n\nPart of the frustration, according to several Republican strategists and operatives, stems from Scott’s hands-off approach to the primaries — a move that some Republicans say allowed Trump to elevate risky Senate candidates with little, if any, prior political experience.\n\n\n\nScott, meanwhile, has defended that approach, arguing that it should be up to Republicans voters — not politicians — to pick their nominees. Asked about McConnell’s remarks about candidate quality during an appearance on Fox News Radio’s “Brian Kilmeade Show” on Thursday, Scott called the comments “a shot at our candidates and the voters.”\n\n\n\n“The people in these states, they picked these people,” Scott said. “So respect the vote of the people of these states.”\n\n\n\n“I’m going to fight like hell every day and be a cheerleader for our hard-working candidates,” he added.\n\n\n\nDoug Heye, a Republican strategist, said that there’s no denying that the GOP is facing a hefty challenge in flipping the Senate, and that candidate quality is part of that equation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It was always a fact that flipping the Senate was going to be harder than the House, and admitting that shouldn’t be a problem,” Heye said. “And now that we have a much more difficult terrain for the GOP, it should reemphasize that a lot of the curtain-measuring was wrong.”\n\n\n\n“Candidate quality absolutely matters and we know that because we’ve seen Republicans give away seats over the past dozen years.”\n\n\n\nBut, Heye added, whether the GOP’s roster of Senate candidates succeeds or fails in November will have little to do with what criticism they get from anonymous political operatives.\n\n\n\n“Every six years, there were GOPers trashing Richard Burr’s campaigning on background – and he won every single time,” Heye said, referring to the retiring senior senator from North Carolina.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nScott, a former health care executive and two-term Florida governor, has reason to be skeptical of the party establishment’s traditional approach to primaries. In 2010, he won an upset victory in the Republican nominating contest for Florida governor that many GOP insiders believed favored now-former state Attorney General Bill McCollum.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd it’s not the first time that McConnell and Scott have butted heads. Scott rankled the Senate minority leader earlier this year after he released his “Plan to Rescue America,” a policy agenda that some Republicans feared would muddle their messaging ahead of the midterms. \n\n\n\nMcConnell sought to swiftly shut down any notion that Scott’s plan reflected what Senate Republicans would do if they recaptured the majority, saying that the GOP “will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years.”\n\n\n\nStill, the latest spat between Scott and McConnell comes at an inopportune time. With the Senate split 50-50 between the two parties, Republicans are hoping to avoid any friction within their own ranks as they look to build a united front against Democrats this fall.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut flipping control of the Senate this year means that Republicans will have to hold their current seats in battlegrounds like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, and pick up at least one Democratic-held Senate seat — most likely in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada or New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nThat’s not to say that Republicans are pessimistic about their chances of winning back their Senate majority. One Republican strategist who has worked on Senate campaigns said that any tension between McConnell and Scott stemmed simply from a difference in philosophy and likely won’t weigh on the ultimate outcome of the midterms.\n\n\n\n“I think, when it all comes down to it, they both want to get Republicans elected,” the strategist said. “You can disagree on the process. But if we win back the majority — and I think that we will — you can be damn sure that none of this is going to matter.”",

We had a good question this week that spurned a lot of conversation.\nWhat we wanted to know from Bucs fans is how much longer of a leash they felt Ben Cherington should have? The Pirates have not improved much, if at all, from last season, as they’re careening towards another 100-loss campaign. The farm system is still considered talented, but is no longer rated one of the top three or four groups in the league. \nHow much more patience should we have with Cherington? Here’s what you all had to say:\n  \n        \n  \nThere you have it. At least two more seasons is the concensus. It is interesting that almost one in five Pirates fans are ready for him to be fired now. \nWe’ll be back soon with more SB Nation Reacts polls!",

        "description": "Photo by Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Welcome to September, where everything’s made up and the roster sizes don’t matter The Cleveland Guardians have activated pitcher Cody Morris off the 60-day injured list, placing him and infielder Ernie Clement on the expanded 28-man roster for September. \nMorris, 25, has been rehabbing with the Columbus Clippers since Aug. 3. In his 15.1 innings there (three starts, three appearances out of the bullpen) he allowed four earned runs with 30 strikeouts and six walks. FanGraphs ranked Morris as the Guardians’ No. 18 prospect heading into the season, with his 60-grade changeup as his most promising pitch and health as his biggest risk. \nIn addition to the changeup, morris also throws a four-seamer, curveball, and most recently, a cutter. \nThanks to COVID eliminating the 2020 minor-league season and his own misfortunate injuries, Morris has pitched just 82.1 innings since 2019. His strikeout totals have remained through the roof, though, as he finally sits on the doorstep of pitching in the majors. \nBeing that Morris was on the injured list, he will still be playoff eligible if the Guardians can maintain their AL Central lead and play some extended baseball. Whether or not Morris actually plays in October will depend on how he performs in September — there is certainly room for him in the bullpen if he can seize the opportunity. While the Guardians bullpen has been stellar recently (including a stretch of 32.1 consecutive innings without an earned run allowed) it is a unit that could use a boost. \nIf Morris has everything working, he should get plenty of opportunities to prove it when Terry Francona can’t rely on the big three of Emmanuel Clase, Trevor Stephan, and James Karinchak. Eli Morgan has been a trainwreck recently, and it appears even Tito realizes he can’t use Bryan Shaw every single day (no matter how much he wants to pitch). \nAs for Ernie Clement, I don’t know man. Your guess is as good as mine. He does have familiarity with the team, playing in 59 games and slashing .203/.268/.224 before being optioned on Aug. 1. He played a variety of positions in his limited time but serves the same purpose as Tyler Freeman (or even Gabriel Arias) without the upside. Only time will tell how much he actually plays down the stretch.",

(Iñárritu has, I suspect, a slightly sketchy idea about the working lives of actual journalist-slash-documentary film-makers, as opposed to those of colossally important Oscar-winning feature directors.) But now, at this moment of triumph, our hero finds himself in a midlife crisis of identity, plunged into a rabbit hole of memories and hallucinatory anxieties about his family, his career and Mexico itself.All our reviews from Venice 2022 Continue reading...",

The new feature seems to build on the “Search in sidebar” function added to Edge in 2020, but it adds even more multitasking abilities.\nThe sidebar includes some small but useful panes, like the one that lets you search the web and quickly read articles, or the one that includes a variety of widgets, such as a calculator, dictionary, internet speed test, and unit convertor.

        "description": "Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Yankees have almost no starting rotation depth. If they need to tap into their reserves again, they should use an opener. Remember the opener? After the Tampa Bay Rays employed it to great effect early in 2018, the opener took Major League Baseball by storm. During the latter half of the 2018 season, the Dodgers, Athletics, Twins, and Rangers made extensive use of the opener to deal with depleted pitching staffs, and both the Athletics and Brewers even used them in the postseason. Although they used it just once in 2018, the Yankees paired Chad Green with Nestor Cortes, Chance Adams, and David Hale 15 times in 2019 to compensate for injuries to the starting rotation.\nThe opener has largely fallen out of day-to-day use throughout baseball, although some teams (most notably the Rays) still use them from time to time. The 2021 Yankees, for example, used Wandy Peralta in the role on August 6th and Lucas Luetge on August 11th, turning to bullpen games only when Gerrit Cole, Jordan Montgomery, and Corey Kluber were all on the shelf at the same time. At this point, the opener has for the most part failed as a regular part of most teams’ starting rotations, and has instead become a desperate tactic for teams in dire needing of pitching depth.\nAnd through their own fault, the Yankees are on the precipice of running out of pitching.\nHad you told me in the middle of July that the Yankees would see their starting pitching depth taxed, I would not have been all that surprised. They had been extremely healthy — Luis Gil, who was out for the season, was their only major injury — and a healthy pitching staff is not something that you see for a full season unless you’re playing MLB The Show with injuries turned off. On top of that, Luis Severino and Jameson Taillon each had extensive injury histories, while Nestor Cortes was well on his way to the highest innings total of his career. Injuries were bound to happen.\nAnd so, naturally, the Yankees did the one thing that every contending team does at the trade deadline when they need pitching: they empty the cupboard of all the major starting pitching prospects in the upper minors (JP Sears, Ken Waldichuck, Luis Medina, and Hayden Wesneski) and sent Jordan Montgomery to the St. Louis Cardinals for a center fielder in a walking boot.\nAlthough he’s struggled so far as a member of the Yankees, I’m not going to complain about the decision to acquire Frankie Montas from the Oakland A’s, as they did need to add another starter with front-of-the-rotation ability. I do want to highlight, however, that it was a calculated risk trading away Sears, Waldichuck, Medina, and Wesneski all at the same time. At the time, the ideal world where everybody stays healthy looked pretty good for the Yankees — a rotation of Gerrit Cole, Nestor Cortes, Frankie Montas, Jordan Montgomery, and Jameson Taillon would have best-in-baseball potential, while Clarke Schmidt and Domingo Germán would serve as rotation depth and Luis Severino would be waiting in the wings for a call-up when eligible to return from the 60-day IL in the middle of September.\nFrom the moment it was announced that the Yankees were sending Montgomery to the Cardinals, the picture became muddled. Germán slotted into Monty’s spot, and although he’s filled it well, that left Schmidt as the only trustworthy piece left to make a spot start. Then Nestor Cortes hit the shelf a week ago, leaving the Yankees with no obvious other candidates ... a situation that soon looked dire when a line drive hit Jameson Taillon in the forearm on Tuesday, knocking him out of the game.\nAlthough the reports on Taillon were better than expected and it seems that he has avoided a serious injury, it suddenly raised the question: Who would have replaced him in the rotation if he needed to miss time? Who’s next?\nRight now, there’s no obvious answer. The only starting pitcher above Single-A left on the 40-man roster is Deivi García, a 23-year-old former top prospect who has not pitched well since 2020, who struggled so badly this season he was demoted to Double-A, and who will be pitching out of the bullpen in Triple-A Scranton down the stretch. At this point, I’m not even sure the Yankees consider him a starting pitcher anymore, and wouldn’t be surprised if they are hoping for him to become another (albeit shorter) Dellin Betances.\nOutside the 40-man roster, the pickings continue to be slim. Ryan Weber has impressed in a trio of appearances at the big league level this season, but he doesn’t exactly have a lengthy track record and has made just 16 starts at the major league level. Recently-acquired Chi Chi Gonzalez has a career 5.72 ERA across six seasons and has allowed eight runs in 11 big league innings this year. Prospect Matt Krook has had his share of ups and downs this season, and likely profiles more as a reliever than a starter.\nIt’s not exactly an inspiring group of options, that’s for sure. Because of this, the Yankees would be better served using them not as starters, but as the bulk guys behind an opener. The main point of an opener, if you recall, is to shut down the top of the order in the first inning with a reliever, giving the follower a lower chance of seeing the top of the order a third time. It’s far from a perfect scheme, of course — not all relievers are accustomed to pitching so early in the game, and not all starters are used to coming out of the bullpen (although it should be noted that all the available options have worked as relievers). At this point, however, would you rather have García or Weber face, for example, Luis Arraez and Carlos Correa three times, or would you rather Ron Marinaccio or Greg Weissert have one go at it?\nTo that, I say, “If it comes to it, bring me the opener.”",

        "description": "While headlines focus on deep partisan divisions and the accompanying rhetorical bombast from all sides, Congress has managed to move some pieces of bipartisan legislation this year. That approach soon will be necessary for the periodic reauthorization of the farm bill. Usually, this bill has been passed under less confrontational auspices in Congress between the two parties, but it now comes up at a time when food security issues are in the limelight.\n\n\n\nThe farm bill is a gigantic package of legislation that affects a variety of key industries beyond what laymen would consider strictly agriculture, from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for lower-income families to programs that make up the farming safety net.\n\n\n\nThe 2023 version of the farm bill comes at a time of major challenges for farmers, many of whom face supply chain disruptions, drought conditions, increases in interest rates for loans, price spikes for fuel, transportation and production materials, and — like American families — the general effects of high inflation.\n\n\n\nIt is no wonder that farmers’ pessimism continues to grow, according to Purdue University’s Ag Economy Barometer, a monthly survey and analysis of economic sentiment among farmers. In recent editions, about half of survey respondents “expect their farms to be worse off financially a year from now,” including a record high of 51 percent in the July report.\n\n\n\nThe food and agricultural trade effects of Russia’s war in Ukraine, which has been a major exporter of agricultural and food commodities, has reinforced the national security implications of issues with food supply issues that the COVID-19 pandemic also brought to the forefront.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the national security implications of agricultural and food supply policy are weighing heavily in the farm bill’s pending reauthorization, with strained relations between China and the U.S. adding to the growing pile of concerns regarding the need for ensuring an abundant and safe food supply for America. Rep. August Pfluger (R-Texas) recently touched upon this theme, saying, “When you look at a farm bill, I hope that we can all look at this as a national security issue.”  \n\n\n\nThe farming safety net and related agricultural trade policy has been a source of tension during previous farm bill hearings and debates. One program that has earned bipartisan support is U.S. sugar policy, which was approved with a historic bipartisan margin of 141 House votes the last time it was reauthorized.\n\n\n\nWhile some economic conservatives would prefer a more immediate move to a market free from government intervention for commodities such as sugar, others prefer a more step-by-step approach, especially given the nature of the global sugar market. Some governments, such as India and Brazil, subsidize their sugar production and then dump the excess sugar on the global market at prices far below the cost of production. These factors contribute to sugar — a vital commodity in overall food production — being one of the most distorted commodity markets in the world. Still, American trade commitments make us the third largest importer of sugar in the world. \n\n\n\nThe good news for free-market defenders and proponents of less government interference is that loan programs embedded in our sugar policy are designed to not cost American taxpayers any money — in fact, sugar producers who receive loans pay them back with interest.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere have been proposed paths that could take us toward a freer market — the most notable one pushes for countries that trade in sugar to eliminate all tariffs and subsidies before the U.S. would repeal existing sugar policies, resulting in a truly free market. In the meantime, however, American sugar producers contribute $23 billion to the American economy each year.\n\n\n\nWith geopolitical uncertainty and conflict on the rise, and the correlated sense that food security and national security go hand in hand, the coming farm bill may be one bright spot in a congressional environment that is often hindered by partisan discord.\n\n\n\nMario H.

federal judge on Thursday declined to issue an immediate decision in a case brought by former President Trump, whose attorneys asked the court to appoint a third party legal expert to review evidence seized by FBI investigators when they searched his Florida home.\n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon said she will issue a ruling at some point on whether to appoint a so-called special master to review the evidence and temporarily block the Justice Department's investigation into the mishandling of classified records due to their storage at Mar-a-Lago. She did not specify a timeline for when she might issue that decision.\n\n\n\nCannon wrote last Saturday that it was her “preliminary intent” to appoint a special master, and on Thursday asked, “What is the harm?” in such an appointment.\n\n\n\nChris Kise, the former Florida solicitor general who officially joined Trump’s legal team this week, argued that appointing a special master as a neutral third party would restore faith in the investigation.\n\n\n\n“This is an unprecedented situation. We need to lower the temperature,” Kise said. “We need to take a deep breath.”\n\n\n\nDuring courtroom arguments the Justice Department warned against any decision that would stall its investigation of Trump. \n\n\n\nJay Bratt, head of the counterintelligence division of the Justice Department, argued Trump does not have the authority to claim privilege over documents from his time in the White House because “he is no longer president.”\n\n\n\nIn the warrant that allowed for the search Trump is now contesting, the government indicated it was focused on violations of the Espionage Act and possible obstruction to its investigation as documents were evidently “concealed and removed” during the more than a year they were stored at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\nThe Miami Herald reported that during Thursday’s hearing, it was revealed that more than 300 classified documents had been obtained by federal authorities since Trump left office. Those documents were either turned over by Trump or seized during the search at Mar-a-Lago, the news outlet reported.\n\n\n\nThe hearing came after the Justice Department filed a lengthy brief asking the court to reject Trump’s request, arguing a filter team composed of investigators not assigned to the case have already reviewed the evidence to scan for personal property, as well as any materials that might be covered by attorney-client privilege. \n\n\n\nTrump made the request for a special master two weeks after his home was searched — delaying a move others, like his prior attorney Michael Cohen, have made the very same day.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department noted in a Tuesday brief that it has already completed much of its reviews for any privileged materials but stressed that a special master would halt the progress of the investigation to replicate protective measures the government has already taken.\n\n\n\nIt also noted that securing a special master in this case would be especially complicated, in part because a special master would likely need to obtain a security clearance to review the records and special authorization from intelligence agencies.\n\n\n\nTrump’s legal team has argued that a special master would help shield the government from obtaining any information that should not have been swept up in the search. But they’ve also argued Trump had a right to retain presidential records due to executive privilege.\n\n\n\nThe government has flatly rejected that argument, noting that presidential records are property of the government and must be managed by the National Archives.\n\n\n\nThursday’s hearing came two days after a filing from the Justice Department laid out how Trump and his team had repeatedly rebuffed attempts to acquire sensitive documents. The government filing included a photo of documents labeled “secret” and “top secret” laid out on the floor of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\n\n\nTrump, in a post Wednesday on his Truth Social platform, accused agents of having strewn the documents on the floor, but in the process he appeared to confirm that he kept the materials in “cartons” in his office at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\nSeparately from the Justice Department investigation, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence notified lawmakers last week that it intends to conduct its own review of the potential national security fallout stemming from the documents’ handling.\n\n\n\nAccording to reports, the sensitive nature of the information kept at Trump’s home, which included some of the most highly classified materials, was at issue in the courtroom, with Cannon saying she would consider allowing that review to continue even if she granted Trump’s request for a special master.\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press contributed.\n\n\n\n— Updated at 4:39 p.m.",

Don Young’s (R-Alaska) term in the House, scoring&nbsp;an upset victory over two Republicans&nbsp;in a reliably red state that former President Trump carried by 10 points less than two years ago.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPeltola, who will be the first Alaska Native to serve in Congress as well as the first woman to serve as the state’s lone representative in the House, defeated&nbsp;Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee, and&nbsp;Nick Begich III, a staunch conservative from Alaska’s most prominent Democratic family, in a race that tested the state’s new ranked-choice voting system, in which voters rank the candidates in order of preference.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAny conclusions drawn from the results come with some caveats. Peltola will be on the ballot once again in November when she’ll seek a full term in the House. And special elections are hardly seen as reliable predictors of a party’s chances in regularly scheduled general elections.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere’s also the open question of whether Peltola’s win was more a vote of confidence in Democrats or simply a rejection of Palin, a former Republican political star who irked many Alaskans when she resigned as governor after she and the late Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) lost&nbsp;the 2008 presidential election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Peltola’s&nbsp;victory in the special election is the latest sign that Democrats are gaining momentum heading into the final stretch before the 2022 midterm elections,&nbsp;a little more than a week after Democrats notched another key victory in the special election in New York’s 19th Congressional District.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThose two wins, combined with a series of solid performances by Democrats in other recent special elections, are among a growing list of signs that the political environment may be improving for the party that has spent much of the past year bracing for an electoral thrashing in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRecent polling shows Democrats in their strongest position in months on the generic ballot, a question that asks voters which party they would rather see win control of Congress. A Wall Street Journal poll released on Thursday found&nbsp;Democrats regaining an edge over Republicans&nbsp;on that question after the same survey in March found them trailing the GOP by 5 points.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlso on Thursday, The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan handicapper,&nbsp;shifted five more House races toward Democrats, including Peltola’s race, which moved from a “Likely” Republican win to a toss-up.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLet’s be clear:&nbsp;Democrats are still facing a tough political landscape this year. President Biden’s approval rating is still underwater and the party in power almost always loses ground in Congress in midterm elections. Democrats are also defending an already-narrow majority and Republicans appear likely to pick up a handful of seats thanks to the redistricting process alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn other words, Democrats are in a better position than they were even a month ago, but that alone is far from a guarantee that their majorities in the House and Senate will be spared. \n\n\n\nRepublicans eager to recalibrate Senate prospects\n\n\n\nRepublicans are looking to hit the reset button on their Senate strategy going into the midterms as several of their candidates in contested states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Georgia show signs of losing momentum, trailing their Democratic opponents in polling or getting out-fundraised.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut there are signs of Republicans breathing new life into races that could pose decisive over which party controls the upper chamber next term, including tweaking rhetoric on issues like abortion and the election and funneling in money into races, as our Mychael Schnell&nbsp;writes.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHedging bets:&nbsp;McConnell said on Monday he thinks Republican Senate candidates Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, Herschel Walker in Georgia and Rep. Ted Budd in North Carolina have a “good chance of winning,” also saying this week “I think Oz has a great shot at winning.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the state of play comes against the backdrop of what has become a more public disagreement between Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, over their views on the GOP Senate landscape.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRemember what McConnell&nbsp;said&nbsp;last month?&nbsp;“I think there’s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. Senate races are just different — they’re statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nScott claps back in an op-ed in the Washington Examiner: “We have great candidates with incredible backgrounds and ideas to make our country better. Do I wish they had more money than their Democratic opponent? Of course. But we have great candidates, chosen by the voters in their states, and our job is to help each one of them win.” \n\n\n\nTrump heads to Pennsylvania for Oz, Mastriano \n\n\n\nFormer President Trump is heading back to Pennsylvania on Saturday to give a boost to three of his endorsed candidates just over two months out from the midterms. Trump is set to hold a rally in Wilkes-Barre for Senate candidate&nbsp;Mehmet Oz, gubernatorial candidate&nbsp;Doug Mastriano&nbsp;and House candidate&nbsp;Jim Bognet.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe trip comes as Democratic candidates&nbsp;John Fetterman&nbsp;and&nbsp;Josh Shapiro&nbsp;lead their Republican rivals in the races for Senate and governor, respectively. And in a sign of the changing political landscape, the nonpartisan election handicapper Cook Political Report shifted its rating of the Senate race earlier this month from “toss up” to “lean Democrat.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAgainst the backdrop of all of this is apprehensions among some, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) about the Republican Party’s ability to flip the Senate as GOP candidates see themselves getting out-fundraised by their Democratic peers. Some are also continuing to be dogged by scandals.  \n\n\n\nPOLL WATCH\n\n\n\nTo add to the recent good fortune Democrats are seeing, a poll released on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal shows President Biden leading former President Trump 50 percent to 44 percent in a hypothetical matchup if the 2024 election for president was held today. Last time respondents were asked this question in March, Biden and Trump were tied at 45 percent each. Though the White House has said Biden is intending to seek reelection, Trump has not formally declared candidacy, though he has at times teased out the possibility.  \n\n\n\nAD WATCH\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) is out with a new ad today hitting Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters (R) over abortion. The 30-second ad,&nbsp;named “Jennifer,” targets Masters over his stance on abortion, claiming he supports banning all abortions with no exceptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Arizona Senate candidate previously had a line on his website that said he backed \"a federal personhood law (ideally a Constitutional amendment) that recognizes that unborn babies are human beings that may not be killed,” according to NBC News, though the network said it wasn’t clear from his website when that rule should become applicable. Masters has changed his abortion messaging on his website that shows his support for “a law or a Constitutional amendment that bans late term (third trimester) abortion and partial-birth abortion at the federal level.” \n\n\n\nThat’s it for today.

        "description": "Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes asked the court to toss her fraud conviction on Thursday in a last-ditch effort to avoid jail time, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\n\nHolmes’s lawyer, Amy Saharia, claimed that the 38-year-old did not misrepresent her blood-testing startup Theranos to investors and did not know she was misrepresenting the company, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\n\nSaharia also contended that prosecutors did not meet the standard for proving Holmes had criminal intent to commit fraud. Bloomberg noted that asking the court to toss a conviction is a common and often unsuccessful play by those convicted of white-collar crimes.\n\n\n\nA federal jury found Holmes guilty of four counts of wire fraud in January. Holmes attracted numerous wealthy individuals to invest in her now defunct company, which claimed to be able to run multiple diagnostic tests with a single drop of blood.\n\n\n\nTheranos COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, Holmes’s second-in-command, was convicted of 12 counts of wire fraud in July for defrauding investors and patients, according to the Washington Post. ",

He’s been a starter most of the time, although this year the Cardinals used him mostly in relief. He was 2-0 with a 2.66 ERA, 21 strikeouts and a 1.08 WHIP in his 13 relief outings. He relies on his four-seamer and slider, although one of the Pirates goals is to clean his curveball up.\nSpeaking of cleaning up, an August stint back in Indy seems to have done that for Mitchell,  He had a .375 average with four doubles, two triples, four home runs, 14 RBIs and a 1.126 OPS in 17 games.\nTo make room on the roster, Cam Vieux went back down to Indy. JT Brubaker is officially off the paternity list and will start Sunday. Roansy Contreras will start Saturday.",

        "description": "Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Rodriguez didn’t have it today, but Rodríguez sure did. The Tigers took on the Mariners on a delightful, sunny Detroit afternoon to try to salvage the finale of a three-game set. They did not do so, and lost meekly to the Washingtonians 7-0, getting only four hits in the process. Let’s just say the Tigers looked as powerless as DTE has left much of the metropolitan Detroit area this week.\nEduardo Rodriguez, who’d been generally pretty solid since coming back from his absence, took the hill for the Tigers. Rodriguez was really hitting his stride in mid-May when he initially got injured, and after returning from his leave from the team, he turned in a pair of excellent starts against the Angels and Rangers. After all the turmoil the starting rotation has seen, it’s really nice to see some pieces starting to fit back into the puzzle — assuming they don’t stink up the joint, which they do from time to time.\nThe white-hot Mariners sent Logan Gilbert to the mound. This is Gilbert’s second full season in the majors, and he’s been a nice addition to Seattle’s pitching staff in that time: his strikeout numbers won’t dazzle you, but he limits home runs, doesn’t walk an outrageous number of guys, and will consistently give you about six innings per start (and occasionally seven). He’ll hit the high-90s with his hard stuff, and has a high-80s slider with outstanding movement... which suggests, of course, a pile of strikeouts were in the offing against this Tigers lineup, doesn’t it?\nRodriguez got into trouble right away in the first, walking rookie sensation Julio Rodríguez, and a sure-fire double-play grounder clanked off Jeimer Candelario’s glove at third to put the first two on. After a strikeout, old friend Eugenio Suarez threaded a grounder through the shift to score Rodríguez, putting Seattle up 1-0, and Rodriguez’s first inning took thirty pitches.\nRodríguez took Rodriguez deep on the first pitch of the third, a no-doubter leadoff home run two-thirds of the way up the left-field stands. Ty France thought that was a pretty good idea, so three pitches later he hit his own out to left, making the score 3-0.\nThe Mariners weren’t nearly done scoring, though: Curt Casali crushed a sinker to the right-centrefield gap, scoring a pair. He stopped at second with a double, but he probably could’ve moonwalked to third standing up. A two-out bloop single by France scored Casali, and a foul pop-out to first ended Rodriguez’s day: four innings, six runs (five earned), two walks, five whiffs. Woof. Garrett Hill took over for Rodriguez in the fifth, and he ended up pitching three really nice innings of one-hit ball.\nMeanwhile, Gilbert was breezing his way through the Tigers’ lineup, striking out seven through five, needing only 70 pitches to do so, and only surrendering a pair of weak singles in the process. He was straight-up dealin’ at this point: he struck out two more in the sixth, including Javier Báez on an outside slider that bounced, and that ended his day, matching his career high with nine whiffs.\nOld friend Matthew Boyd pitched the eighth inning for the Mariners, and his first pitch was a beauty of a curveball for a strike. That was the first major-league pitch Boyd threw for a team other than the Tigers since 2015. He threw an impressive 1-2-3 inning, and I can’t help but put this here:\n  \n        \n  \nJosé Cisnero pitched the ninth, loaded the bases with two out, and walked in a run. A running catch by Akil Baddoo in the left-centerfield gap got the Tigers out of the inning without any further damage. But, that capped the scoring for the day, and the Tigers were shut out yet again.\n“Boy, is he strict!”\nWith apologies to the Waco Kid, of course; pitch #4 was a called ball to Akil Baddoo. Tight strike zone all day from Andy Fletcher.\n  \n        \n  \nNotes and Stats\n\nBetween his three-hit effort in the second game of the August 15 doubleheader against the Guardians and yesterday’s game (inclusive), Victor Reyes’ slash line was .327/.379/.442 for a .822 OPS in 58 plate appearances. This includes four doubles and a triple.\nSpeaking of that doubleheader, before today’s game, the first game of that August 15 twinbill featured Javier Báez’s last extra-base hit, off Aaron Civale.\nSeattle right-fielder Taylor Trammell’s name is pronounced truh-MEL. I know, it’s pretty tempting to say it the way you’re used to saying it.\nOn this date in 1897, the first subway in North America opened. Think it was in New York? Think again, smarty-pants, it was in Boston. If you’re familiar with the city, it’s the Tremont Street section of the modern-day Green Line; part of the original tunnel is still being used today.",

        "description": "The Rangers announced they&#8217;ve selected reliever Jesús Tinoco onto the major league roster. Outfielder Nick Solak has also been recalled from Triple-A Round Rock to take the two active roster spots created by September expansion. To open a spot on the 40-man roster, Texas transferred righty Josh Sborz from the 15-day to the 60-day injured list.\nTinoco signed a minor league deal with Texas over the offseason. The hard-throwing righty has spent the bulk of the year in Triple-A, although he did join the MLB club as a temporary replacement while they navigated some COVID-19 issues in June. He appeared in five games, working 5 2/3 innings of three-run ball while averaging 96.4 MPH on his fastball, before heading back to Round Rock. That brief showing marked his fourth consecutive year logging some MLB action. Previously a Rockie and Marlin, Tinoco owns a 4.88 ERA over 51 2/3 career innings.\nThe 27-year-old has yet to establish himself in a big league bullpen, but he&#8217;s had a strong 2022 campaign in the minors. Through 44 Triple-A frames, he owns a 3.27 ERA in a hitter-friendly league. He&#8217;s backed up that run prevention with an above-average 28.5% strikeout rate and an elite 58.7% ground-ball percentage. Tinoco will now get another opportunity to try to carry that over against big league hitters as he looks to stake a claim to a spot in next year&#8217;s bullpen. He&#8217;s out of minor league option years, however, so the Rangers have to keep him in the majors or expose him to waivers now that he&#8217;s earned a 40-man spot.\nSolak has bounced on and off the MLB roster on a couple occasions this year. A former well-regarded hitting prospect, he hasn&#8217;t managed to find much in the way of consistent success against big league arms. Since a strong 2019 rookie season in limited action, Solak has posted below-average numbers at the plate. He&#8217;s also fallen down the defensive spectrum, moving to the corner outfield after struggling as a second baseman. Those issues on both sides of the ball have kept the 27-year-old primarily in Triple-A this season, but he&#8217;s responded to the demotion well to earn another look. Through 259 plate appearances with the Express, Solak is hitting .278/.371/.489 with ten home runs and a robust 11.6% walk rate.\nSborz just landed on the IL a couple days ago with an elbow sprain. He&#8217;s now officially shut down for the season. He&#8217;ll finish the campaign with a 6.45 ERA over 22 1/3 innings of relief, although he did strike out an excellent 32% of batters faced.",

You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. \nAmazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. \nBelow, we’ve listed each model currently available.

        "description": "ASPEN, COLO. — Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) on Wednesday lamented that Hispanic history and culture are not routinely taught in the United States.\n\n\n\n\"I fundamentally believe right now, unfortunately, that Americans for the most part do not know who Latinos are,\" Castro said.\n\n\n\n\"Because our stories and our histories have not been told in American history textbooks and state history textbooks. And being unknown is not just culturally inconvenient. It's also dangerous,\" he added.\n\n\n\nCastro made the remarks, framed around remembrance of lives lost, in his keynote speech for the Raizado Festival, a three-day congregation of Hispanic leaders in the arts, politics and advocacy in Aspen, Colo.\n\n\n\nIn his speech, Castro recognized the advances Latinos have made in the United States, using his own grandmother's immigration story as an example.\n\n\n\n\"My grandmother entered a state of Texas where there were still signs that said, 'No dogs or Mexicans allowed,' where Spanish was still illegal to be spoken in Texas schools. There's so many similar stories like that,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Our parents, our grandparents, who faced these very difficult challenges in American society and didn't give up, persevered, resisted and ultimately, I believe, prevailed. And so we say to them, thank you.\"\n\n\n\nBut Castro also focused on the disproportionate effects on Hispanic communities from crises like COVID-19, gun violence, disinformation and racial persecution.\n\n\n\n\"I read a statistic today that made me stop in my tracks. It said that the life expectancy had dropped a few years during the pandemic for Latinos in the United States. Because in many places in our country, Latino communities were the most affected. We were almost two times as likely to die from COVID 19 as the majority community,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"We also remember the people … in our community, in this new media age that we live in, who were victims of disinformation, who resisted getting a vaccination because they were given bad information, because they were preyed upon by some people,\" added Castro.\n\n\n\nClosing his remarks, Castro was joined by Raizado Festival co-host Mónica Ramírez to lead a procession in remembrance of attendees' dead friends and relatives.\n\n\n\nFestival organizers handed out marigolds — a flower traditionally symbolizing the spirit of the dead in central Mexico — and a mariachi band followed Castro and Ramírez, who led the procession in depositing the flowers in a decorative pond.",

        "description": "Ohio police released body camera footage this week showing officers fatally shooting an unarmed 20-year-old Black man who was asleep when they broke into his room.\n\n\n\nSeveral officers with the Columbus Police Department broke into the home of Donovan Lewis around 2:28 a.m. on Tuesday for the execution of a felony search warrant.\n\n\n\nOutside the apartment, police shouted repeatedly for the occupants to come outside, leading to the arrest of two people who exited with their hands up.\n\n\n\nOfficers questioned the suspects and said they were \"looking for Donovan.\" When he didn't show, they walked inside the apartment and toward the bedroom where he was sleeping.\n\n\n\nRicky Anderson, a canine officer and a 30-year veteran with the department, opened the bedroom door while positioned to the side, his firearm raised and his police dog barking loudly in front of him.\n\n\n\nWhen the door opened, Lewis sat up quickly in confusion. Lewis was not armed, although he may have been holding a vape that police mistook for a firearm.\n\n\n\nAnderson fired one shot, striking Lewis in an unidentified area on the body. Unconscious, Lewis was transported to a local hospital, where he was reported deceased at 3:19 a.m.\n\n\n\nAnother body camera angle sent to The Hill was taken from Anderson's perspective. It shows the officer hurrying into the apartment with his police dog and firing immediately once the door swings open.\n\n\n\nThe Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation has launched an investigation into the shooting, according to a news release.\n\n\n\nNational civil rights attorney Ben Crump tweeted that \"within seconds\" of opening the bedroom door, officers fired.\n\n\n\n\"Police reportedly mistook a vape in the hand of the unarmed young Black man as a weapon,\" Crump wrote. \"This is just the most recent of many fatal police shootings committed by Columbus police involving unarmed citizens — including Andre Hill! The pattern and practices of this police department MUST be reformed!\"\n\n\n\nHill, a 47-year-old Black man, was shot and killed by a Columbus police officer in December 2020, nine seconds after officers confronted him in a garage. Hill was unarmed, holding a hand to his side and a phone in the other hand.\n\n\n\nColumbus officers also shot and killed 16-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant last year, firing after she swung a knife at another person.\n\n\n\nLewis had an outstanding warrant for domestic violence, assault and the improper handling of a firearm, according to the Columbus Dispatch. He also had a girlfriend who is pregnant with his child.\n\n\n\nAn attorney for the Lewis family, Rex Elliott, said at a Thursday news conference there was \"no question\" that Anderson was guilty.\n\n\n\n\"Donovan was alone, in his room, in his bed,\" Elliott said. \"Donovan was unarmed and abiding by police commands to come out of the room when he was shot in cold blood by Officer Anderson.\"\n\n\n\nColumbus Mayor Andrew Ginther (D) tweeted Thursday that he was \"committed to full transparency\" on the shooting.\n\n\n\n\"That is why we released the body-worn camera footage and details of the arrest warrant within roughly 12 hours of the incident,\" he wrote. \"The state's Bureau of Criminal Investigation is investigating, but a thorough accounting takes time. Chief [Elaine] Bryant and I join Donovan’s family as they grieve, and we echo their calls for peace.\"",

        "description": "With its cross- and poly-rhythmic improvisations, Neset’s mind-bending music came as a shock to the classical conductor and his musicians – but also an intoxicating joyBack in 2015, the London Sinfonietta approached me about a project rather different from the Stockhausen and Birtwistle I had conducted with them previously. The group were recording a new album with the up-and-coming Norwegian jazz saxophonist Marius Neset. An enthusiastic (if far from expert) listener to jazz, I leapt at the chance to be involved.Years earlier I had got to know and love Mark-Anthony Turnage’s jazz-infused masterpiece Blood on the Floor as well as his wonderful bluesy saxophone concerto Your Rockaby, so I had a notion of what the meeting of contemporary-classical and jazz could spark when approached from the angle of the former. But I had little idea what to expect from the reverse, and Marius’s score was a shock and a thrill. Hundreds of pages of elaborately scored, virtuoso writing for every member of the 19-strong Sinfonietta ensemble in a context of what seemed to be relentless metrical complexity in some extremely fast tempi. Only the telltale empty staves for Marius’s quartet of saxophone, piano, drums and bass hinted at the extra layer of improvised activity that we would need to integrate with the notated music.Prom 63: Marius Neset and the London Sinfonietta play the Royal Albert Hall, London, at 10.15pm on 3 September Continue reading...",

        "description": "Sitting side-by-side on a couch inside a Plymouth home, three teens wearing traditional embroidered Ukrainian clothing held hands tightly — a bit nervous to be interviewed.“Exciting emotions,” their guardian Anna Prisacari said. “There have been so many emotions.”The three students just arrived in Minnesota and met a couple of weeks ago, thanks to Prisacari’s desire to help those experiencing war hold on to their education.“I want to make sure they feel safe here because every day was an unknown day for them,” Prisacari said. Some of Prisacari’s own family is from Ukraine. Prisacari moved to the United States when she was 15 years old.  She went on to earn her Ph.D. and now works for Amazon.“I know what the value of education is,” Prisacari said. “I came not speaking any English.”Prisacari brought the teens to Minnesota using the federal program, Uniting for Ukraine, which required her to support them when they arrived. The teens’ families agreed to let Prisacari become legal guardian for the year for 15-year-olds Zlata Bileha from Odessa and Dima Nyzhnyk from Lutsk. The youngest student in the group is 14-year-old Iryna Kononenko from Mykolaiv. Iryna Kononenko rests her head on Zlata Bileha&#x27;s shoulder during an interview with MPR News reporter Nina Moini in Plymouth, Minn. on Tuesday.Ben Hovland | MPR NewsThe two oldest, Bileha and Nyzhnyk, are in ninth and 10th grade attending The International School of Minnesota in Eden Prairie on scholarships. The youngest, Kononenko, will go to Minnetonka Middle School West for eighth grade when school starts next week. The students are learning English while they are attending Minnesota schools. “It is very important and big opportunity,” Nyzhnyk said. For all three students, it is also an opportunity to focus on school work, which has become almost impossible in Ukraine.“You listen how rockets and bombs are just fly,” Bileha said. “It is really scary, when I just flew to America, I have nightmares.”Nyzhnyk remembers schools being destroyed, families fleeing their homes and the noises of war.“We have air alarms every day, the whole day,” he said. “It was very hard.”  MN Department of HealthUkrainians arriving in MinnesotaThree students in MinnesotaUkrainian students blogThe students stay in regular contact with their families in Ukraine, and Prisacari said she is working to get mental health resources for them as they settle into life in Minnesota. The group has already made some happy, very Minnesotan memories, Prisacari said. They went to a Twins game, visited a friend’s cabin and went fishing. They also plan to visit the Minnesota State Fair.“Here, I like bacon!” Kononenko shared as the group laughed. “We don’t have bacon!”The Minnesota Department of Human Services said it is unclear how many Ukrainian refugees from the war are in the state because the federal government does not alert states when Ukrainians arrive. However, the state estimates at least 500 Ukrainians have arrived here since March and sought state resources. The state reports there are more than 1,000 entry applications filed with the same program which brought the three Ukrainian teens to Minnesota.Iryna Kononenko (from left to right), 14, Dima Nyzhnyk, 15, and Zlata Bileha, 15, hold a Ukrainian flag they brought to the U.S. outside their host family&#x27;s home in Plymouth, Minn. on Tuesday.Ben Hovland | MPR NewsWhether the students return to Ukraine after the school year depends largely on the situation there at that point, Prisacari said.“Most parents understand school disruptions with COVID, but war is a different angle,” Prisacari said. But home is never far from mind, Prisacari added. The students are doing their own part to give back while they are in Minnesota by planning a fundraiser to send water filters back home. Before the interview ended, the group shared it was very important for them to wear their Ukrainian clothing for their first American interview. “It is Vyshyvanka,” Kononenko said. “We wear it for holidays.” “It’s very important for us, and pictures that we send for our family,” Bileha added. “We just support that we stand with Ukraine, we are always with them.” ",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/giants-select-lewis-brinson-outright-jonathan-bermudez.html",
        "description": "The Giants announced they&#8217;ve selected outfielder Lewis Brinson onto the major league roster. Brinson, who was acquired from the Astros for cash considerations in a minor league trade this morning, will step right into the big leagues as a September call-up. In a corresponding move, San Francisco sent left-hander Jonathan Bermudez outright to Triple-A Sacramento. The Giants hadn&#8217;t previously announced that Bermudez had been designated for assignment, but he&#8217;s apparently already cleared waivers and no longer occupies a spot on the 40-man roster.\nIt was a short stay on the 40-man for Bermudez, who was just claimed off waivers from Houston a week ago. The left-hander has yet to throw a pitch in the San Francisco organization. Added to Houston&#8217;s 40-man roster last offseason to prevent him from being taken in the Rule 5 draft, Bermudez has had a disappointing year in Triple-A. The 26-year-old started 14 of his 19 games with the Astros top affiliate in Sugar Land, but he only managed an 8.96 ERA through 67 1/3 frames. He surrendered a staggering 16 home runs in that time (2.14 HR/9) while only striking out 20% of batters faced.\nThe season obviously hasn&#8217;t been kind to Bermudez, but he&#8217;d posted huge strikeout numbers up through the Triple-A level coming into this year. He&#8217;ll remain in the organization, with San Francisco&#8217;s player development staff having an opportunity to help him get back on track. Bermudez will be eligible for the Rule 5 draft this winter if he&#8217;s not added back onto the 40-man roster by the start of the offseason, but it seems unlikely he&#8217;d be selected after this year&#8217;s rough showing barring a major bounceback this month.\nSan Francisco announced that reliever Andrew Vasquez has likewise gone unclaimed on waivers. Designated for assignment yesterday, Vasquez has also been outrighted to Sacramento. Unlike Bermudez, he&#8217;ll have the right to refuse that assignment and test free agency as a player who has previously cleared outright waivers in his career. Vasquez has been a part of the Blue Jays, Phillies and Giants organizations this season, but he&#8217;s only appeared in nine MLB games (all with Toronto). The left-hander has had an excellent year in the minors, working to a cumulative 1.86 ERA over 19 1/3 innings, mostly at Triple-A.",

The first was the price. At $2,499.95, it rivaled the cost of many traditional surround sound systems comprised of AV receivers and multiple speakers. But perhaps more important was its size. I say this with love, but the original Ambeo Soundbar (which has now been renamed the Ambeo Soundbar Max) was a chunky boy, which hardly made it an easy sell for anyone looking to tuck it discreetly in front of their TV. \nSo although it’s $1,000 cheaper, I think price might only be the second most important change with Sennheiser’s second soundbar, the $1,499.95 Ambeo Soundbar Plus, which the company launched today at an event in Berlin.

        "description": "Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska on Thursday congratulated Democrat Mary Peltola on her victory in the special election to fill the vacant House seat representing the state. \n\n\n\nPeltola on defeated two Republicans, former Alaska governor and GOP vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin and Nick Begich, to serve the remainder of the late Rep. Don Young’s (R) term. Young held the seat for almost half a century before his death in March.\n\n\n\nMurkowski noted that Peltola’s victory made state and national history, as she will become the first Alaska Native to serve in Congress.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“While it will be impossible for Alaska to replace Congressman Young, Mary has a long track record of public service to our great state — including our time working together in the Alaska State Legislature — and I look forward to her join Senator Sullivan and I as we advance Alaska’s priorities over the coming months,” she said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPeltola and Murkowski served in the Alaska state House together for a few years before Murkowski became a senator. \n\n\n\nSullivan said he hopes to be able to work with Peltola over the next four months on the “issues that truly matter to our state,” like inflation and energy costs, using Alaska’s natural resources with “much-needed” infrastructure and achieving sustainable and healthy fisheries for all residents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The three-person Alaska congressional delegation has a long and distinguished record of working together to advance and defend the interests of Alaskans, despite not always agreeing on different&nbsp;aspects&nbsp;of politics and policy,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPeltola will face Palin and Begich, the former co-chairman of Young’s 2020 reelection campaign, again in a general election to hold the seat for the next two years in November. She won the special election in the state’s first ranked-choice vote, in which voters could list the candidates in order of their preference.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPeltola led after the first round of the election revealed voters’ first preferences but did not obtain a majority necessary to win outright. Palin came in second in first-place votes, and Begich came in third.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBegich was then eliminated, and his votes were redistributed according to the second preference of his voters. Peltola defeated Palin in the second round by about 3 percentage points.",

        "description": "A bipartisan data privacy bill faces another roadblock, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) expressing concern Thursday that the proposal could limit state protections. \n\n\n\nPelosi cited concerns raised by leaders in her home state of California, which has been leading the way in the U.S. in setting data privacy standards, about the American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA).&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Proudly, California leads the nation not only in innovation, but also in consumer protection.&nbsp;With so much innovation happening in our state, it is imperative that California continues offering and enforcing the nation’s strongest privacy rights,” Pelosi said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPelosi did not dismiss the bill, which advanced out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee with bipartisan support in July, entirely. She said she will continue to work with Committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) to address “California’s concerns.” \n\n\n\nPallone said in a statement he looks forward to continuing to discuss with Pelosi ways to “further strengthen” the bill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s critical that we put people back in control of their online data and create a strong national privacy standard. This is the most robust and comprehensive legislation to protect Americans’ privacy, and I’m laser focused on building support for final legislation that can be brought to the House floor and become law,” Pallone said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCalifornia Democrats main concern is that the bill sets a national standard that would preempt state law. But preemption is a sticking point for Republicans, and a piece supporters say is crucial to the compromise lawmakers made to craft a bipartisan bill.\n\n\n\nThe version that advanced out of the committee included a provision that would grant the California Privacy Protection Agency, created under California's privacy law, the authority to enforce the ADPPA, seemingly in an attempt to try and quell some of the concerns.\n\n\n\nHowever, California lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce during the July vote said they were concerned the bill could undermine California’s privacy protections. Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Nanette Diaz Barragán (D-Calif.) were the only votes against advancing the bill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.) voted to advance the bill but said she would not vote in favor of passing the bill without additional changes. \n\n\n\nThe proposal aims to set a national standard for how tech companies collect and use Americans’ data, after years of debate within Congress on how to tackle the issue of data privacy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bill would allow users to sue over violations of the law through a private right of action. It also includes protections for children online, including banning targeted ads to minors and treating all information related to individuals under 17 as sensitive data.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe proposal has an even tougher chance of advancing in the Senate, due to pushback from Commerce Committee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.). ",

        "description": "Federal agents searched properties allegedly linked to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg Thursday, according to a new report from NBC New York.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe FBI, Homeland Security Investigations and the New York Police Department were seen searching two New York properties linked to the billionaire ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, NBC New York reported.\n\n\n\nThe agents and detectives were spotted carrying boxes during the search of properties in Manhattan and Southampton, N.Y., and another search is reportedly also underway in Miami, according to the outlet.\n\n\n\nThe FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the New York Police Department did not immediately respond to inquiries from The Hill.\n\n\n\nVekselberg has been sanctioned by the U.S. since 2018. Spanish police and FBI agents seized his $90 million superyacht in April after the Department of Justice alleged bank fraud, money laundering and sanction statues had been violated.\n\n\n\nThe oligarch “used shell companies to obfuscate his interest in the Tango to avoid bank oversight,” the Justice Department investigation alleged.\n\n\n\nAlong with a number of other Russian elites, Vekselberg was hit with new Treasury Department sanctions earlier this year after Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine. \n\n\n\nVekselberg, who leads the conglomerate company Renova Group, has a net worth of more than $6 billion and financial interests spanning multiple sectors of the Russian economy, according to the Treasury Department. \n\n\n\nVekselberg has close ties to Putin and other Moscow leaders and “has taken part in Russian diplomatic and soft power activities on behalf of the Kremlin,” according to the department.",

Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForecasters anticipated an abnormally active hurricane season this year, predicting that between 16 to 20 tropical storms would form between June and November.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOut of those storms, forecasters predicted between six and eight would turn into full-fledged hurricanes.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere was not a single hurricane in the Atlantic for the month of August, something that hasn’t happened since 1997 and the third time to ever happen on record, according to AccuWeather hurricane expert Dan Kottlowski.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSince hurricane season started in June, there have been three other named tropical storms. The first, Alex, which formed on June 5, caused flooding in western Cuba and South Florida.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe second storm of the season, Bonnie, formed in early July, and took a strange route from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The storm turned into a category 1 hurricane and resulted in the deaths of at least five people after tearing through Central America.  \n\n\n\nTropical Storm Colin, formed right after Bonnie, about 50 miles southwest of South Carolina’s Myrtle Beach. The storm drenched the Carolinas in heavy rainfall and became the first tropical storm to make landfall in the U.S. this season.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere was a close call during the second week of August, when a tropical rainstorm formed over the western Gulf of Mexico, but the system eventually passed over South Texas before it could grow into anything worse, according to AccuWeather.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

are fuming about ranked choice and \"jungle\" primary voting systems after Democrat Mary Peltola won a special House election in Alaska over former Gov. Sarah Palin (R) and Republican Nick Begich. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe race in The Last Frontier was the first federal test of the state’s unusual voting system that is gaining influence across the country.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Ranked-choice voting is a scam to rig elections,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) tweeted after results from Alaska’s special election showing Peltola won Wednesday. “60% of Alaska voters voted for a Republican, but thanks to a convoluted process and ballot exhaustion—which disenfranchises voters—a Democrat ‘won.’”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublican National Committee (RNC) national press secretary Emma Vaughn said in a statement that the Alaska special election results “prove what we’ve known all along — ranked-choice voting disenfranchises voters.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Our Republican nominees earned nearly 60% of Alaskans’ votes on the ballot, and now every single one of those voters lost their voice to choose their representative in Congress. Alaskans deserve an equal and fair process, two things this special election were not,” Vaughn said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTyler Bower, an RNC national committeeman from Arizona, told The Hill on Thursday that he plans to lead a resolution for the RNC to formally oppose ranked choice voting at the RNC’s next winter meeting at the start of 2023.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the Alaska system, voters pick one candidate in a nonpartisan jungle primary. Then the top four candidates head to the general election, where voters rank their choices. If no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote, there is an automatic runoff where ballots for the candidate with the least votes are reallocated to the next-choice pick, if the voter made one.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfter independent Al Gross withdrew from the general election, the first round of the Alaska special election saw nearly 60 percent of voters choosing Palin and Begich. But when Begich’s votes were redistributed, only about half went to Palin, with Peltola getting around 29 percent of his first-round voters. Another fifth of his voters did not make a second-choice pick.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCritics say that the ranked choice system is confusing — Palin&nbsp;called&nbsp;it “convoluted” after her loss on Wednesday night — but advocates point to an&nbsp;exit poll&nbsp;where 85 percent of Alaskan voters said the system was “simple.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdvocates for the system also argue that it gives more power to voters rather than to parties, disincentivizes negative campaigning and is a politically neutral system. And the system does have some support among Republicans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The reason the party doesn't like it is because it takes the decision about who the candidates are away from the party and gives it back to voters,” said consultant Robert Dillon, who previously worked for Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “The parties naturally, you know, find that threatening, but voters don't.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe system could also shield Murkowski, who voted to impeach former President Trump, from conservative blowback and help her win reelection this year, since she did not have to face Trump-endorsed challenger Kelly Tshibaka in a closed primary election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBower, the Arizona RNC national committeeman, said that the system will ultimately lead to conservative factions of the Republican Party not being represented.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The reality is, it's really a system of moderation,” Bower said, adding that the goal of many ranked choice advocates is to eliminate partisan primaries. “That is very destructive for the political parties. … What it does is essentially creates a uniparty or a single-party system, or a no-party system, when most of the public for a long time have always been advocates for more parties.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It eliminates any possibility that someone that's more conservative — and really, on the Democratic side, more progressive — can ever make it through that system,” Bower said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA GOP turn against ranked choice voting started in 2018, when former Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R-Maine) lost to Democratic Rep. Jared Golden after a ranked choice system went into effect in Maine.\n\n\n\nPoliquin had the most first-round votes, but after votes from independent candidates were reallocated, Golden crossed the 50 percent threshold.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCotton previously&nbsp;spoke out against&nbsp;the ranked choice voting system in 2020, when ranked choice advocates attempted a ballot measure to change the Arkansas system. He portrayed it as a scheme pushed by “out-of-state liberal billionaires” trying to make Arkansas “liberal, woke, and progressive.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Jungle primaries with ranked-choice voting rob voters of a clear electoral choice,” Cotton said in a statement to The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the change is getting criticism from Democrats, too, as voters will consider a Nevada ballot initiative to impose a system similar to Alaska’s. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.)&nbsp;both oppose the measure.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, it may be too early to tell whether the system puts Republicans at a disadvantage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The GOP is now 0-2 in 2 high-profile races decided in both states with RCV — ME-2 in 2018 and the Alaska House special. Does that mean RCV is biased against Republicans? I don’t really think so – the sample size is tiny,” Kyle Kondik, managing editor at Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said in an email to The Hill. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s also not Democrats’ or RCV’s [ranked choice voting's] fault that the 2 top Republicans running in Alaska, Begich and Palin, did not seem to do a good enough job of catering their campaigns to the system.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublican digital strategist Eric Wilson says Republicans should not completely discount ranked choice voting, especially when it can be used in a closed nominating process rather than a nonpartisan jungle primary. He pointed to the Virginia Republican Party using a ranked choice–like nominating system last year, resulting in the nomination of Gov. Glenn Youngkin and the party’s first statewide wins in more than a decade.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“What I’m trying to do is stand in front of the mob and say don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, because ranked choice voting is a very useful mechanism for Republicans, especially when it comes to Ronald Reagan's 11th Commandment of ‘Thou shalt not speak ill of fellow Republicans,’” Wilson said.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Cuban defector. Cuban defectors.\nI remember this episode on Jomboy (or maybe it was a Tweet) where former baseball player and now Podcast member Trevor Plouffe thought loud about if there were actually any bad baseball players that come from Cuba. Self-proclaimed D-Backs fan and Jomboy sidekick Jake somehow didn’t know the answer every Diamondbacks fan probably knows. \nIf Plouffe still would like to know if there were any bad baseball players from Cuba, he might want to dig deep in the list of Baseball Almanac of all major leaguers that were born in Cuba, although the list on Wikipedia of baseball players that defected from Cuba might perhaps be more interesting. And maybe less reliable. There is another list on BR Bullpen about Cuban defectors. \nHowever it might be and which one we might find more reliable, it is obvious that many baseball players from Cuba have defected throughout the years. Although we know about at least one of the worst Cuban baseball players, most of the times we only remember the best. Like Aroldis Chapman, Raisel Iglesias, José Abreu...but they all share the hard choice of defection from their country and the hurdles to success afterwards.\nEddie Oropesa went through that process, of defection from his country and trying to find his way into the major leagues. He succeeded where many others failed, and as such his story is already one of success. But the baseball fan base in Arizona might not perceive his time in the desert that way.\n“Edwin Jackson joined a small, exclusive club this evening, albeit one he’d rather not be part of. He became only the fifth pitcher in Diamondbacks history to allow ten earned runs in an outing, the first to do so since September 2004. [...] Trivia question: what’s particularly remarkable about the first pitcher to do it, Eddie Oropesa? [...] Eddie Oropesa was the first Diamondbacks pitcher to allow ten earned runs in an outing... But most remarkably, he did it as a relief pitcher: only one bullpen arm has matched that feat since, Jimmy Gobble for the Royals in 2008.” - Jim McLennan in a game recap on AZSnakePit on 04/28/2010 when the D-Backs lost 12-1 to the Rockies with Edwin Jackson giving up 10 runs.\nNot your average defector.\nMaybe Eddie Oropesa’s story is more remarkable than that of a José Abreu. I mean, according to his own phrasing, he wasn’t really much of a baseball talent and had to cope with politics to get where he wanted to be: outside of Cuba.\n“When I finished sixth grade I went to “Escuela Vocacional”, in the beginning of the 80s. There I had to do a test and it was a big disappointment when they told me I was no good, literally. That made me feel really bad, for a kid it is hard to assume you are not suited to do what you love most, although my family helped me a lot to overcome it.” - Eddie Oropesa on being rejected for the secondary school’s baseball team (DBE translation from Spanish)\nDespite not being able to play baseball, he remembers part of his time in secondary school as his best time in life, because he watched and lived baseball.\n“Me and my group of friends used to escape from the school in uniform to go to the local baseball stadium. We had to jump the fence behind the school and get a bus to see and watch a game between the towers. I used to have many emotions when we would arrive at the park and we could hear the speaker announcing the batters through the audio, which would make us even more anxious to enter.” - Eddie Oropesa on his happiest time of his youth (DBE translation from Spanish)\nBut those nightly escapes would cost him dearly as, according to his own memories, someone betrayed them and he was forced to leave the school, also because his parents were considered “worms”: people that do not have a burning heart for the Cuban revolution. But Oropesa doesn’t lament his ejection, as he would end up in a different (high) school where he would get the opportunity again to play baseball.\nIt is here where he is able to perform again, and he progresses. As a young pitching prospect he is selected to play in the National league with the second team of Matanzas, Citricultores, which is a collection of young players and older ‘second rank’ players.\nEddie remembers the time as “very tough” as he had to compete not only against the best players of Cuba at a very young age (and still developing as a player), but also because of match fixing and his bad relationship with executives and coaches. In a game against the more accomplished team from Matanzas, Henequeneros, there is a turning point in the baseball career and determination of Oropesa, when the pitching coach after the 7th inning while up 2-0 tells him to give up a couple of runs to the opponent, because they “should win this game”.\nI told him I wanted to win, because it was a great opportunity for me to get to the National team. In that moment he showed me that if I would not give the game to them, they would destroy my life. They would have taken me out of baseball, the university and I wouldn’t be here. I couldn’t jeopardize the outcome of this game and the classification of the top team of the province because of my winning appetite. - Eddie Oropesa on being confronted on deliberately losing a game and set aside his aspirations (DBE translation from Spanish)\nFor every player in his early twenties, that would be a tough situation to handle right there and right then. Oropesa immediately makes up his mind and decides to take one step back now and make a couple of steps forward later. He relates that he threw two strikes to the next batter and then deliberately an amount of very bad pitches to walk two guys and being taken off. \n“After that I never played with the same love again, this was marked in my mind forever. From then on, I just decided to focus on me and develop myself as a pitcher to get to the Cuban national team and leave at the very first voyage.” - Eddie Oropesa on his determination to leave Cuba (DBE translation from Spanish)\nOropesa did not have to wait very long for his opportunity. The two teams of Matanzas would fuse into one and the Cuban pitched well enough to become a fixed name in the rotation. \nThe phone call.\nIn 1993 Oropesa is requested to join a Cuban national team, the college world team, that will participate in a tournament in Buffalo, USA. He was almost removed from the team because he was sick in the training camp, but is allowed to board the plane after showing enough skills in an exhibition match. \nHis plan was to escape in Miami during a stop where a cousin and aunt would pick him up after calling them, for which he learns their telephone number by heart. But he isn’t able to sneak out in Miami and has to board the plane to Buffalo. When he arrives in Buffalo he finds out there are more hurdles than just the eye of the Cuban government.\n“I had no idea on how to make a phone call. I was just a country kid that had spoken through the phone just a couple of times in my entire life. I stopped near a public phone and I asked a team mate if he could help me out, that they were going to send me money.” - Eddie Oropesa on ordinary problems a young kid from Cuba could face when wanting to defect (DBE translation and adaptation from Spanish)\nThings don’t go as planned. When his cousin drives to Buffalo to pick him up, he is not able to drive the car into the hotel parking because of not having credentials. The next day his cousin appears in a game against Korea to discuss a new plan, but Oropesa is nervous and desperated. He decides to go for an improvised and risky run out of the stadium.\n“I took of my slippers, screamed some obscene stuff about the Cuban government and ran. People started shouting and I jumped the fence and I didn’t stop running until throwing myself through the window of my cousin’s car. Because of all the nerves we took the wrong exit towards Canada instead of going to New Jersey where we had to take the plane.” - Eddie Oropesa on his risky escape (DBE translation from Spanish)\nAlthough Oropesa was now free, his family back in Cuba had to endure tough times. His pregnant wife didn’t know anything about his plans and got agitated and had to be taken to hospital because of several bleedings that could jeopardize the health of the unborn baby. While arriving at the hospital the first doctor refused to help her because of her defected husband. Oropesa’s entire family eventually had to relocate to a different town because of their reputation and his defection, before eventually finding a way to pay for their move out of the country altogether. \nFree in the US?\nOropesa was a nobody in the USA, but his renowned escape got the attention of another defector, René Arocha, who puts him in contact with his agent. Despite some early contacts with the Cincinnati Reds, Oropesa starts playing in the independent baseball league before becoming eligible in the 1994 MLB draft. \nHe is selected in the 14th round by the Los Angeles Dodgers and has a good start in 2014 in A+ at 22 years of age. The following years aren’t bad but not great either, but what Oropesa stings most is that he doesn’t get any invitations to Spring Trainings, according to him due to signing as a replacement pitcher in the 1995 MLB strike. \n“They asked me if I would sign as a replacement player and I said no. But my family asked for more money to be able to get out of Cuba. Disaster once again struck in my life. I would get a bonus and I would get more money in the minor leagues. But they said that those that would sign would never again play organised baseball. [...] I was marked for life. It didn’t matter how good I would play in the minors, I would not get an invite to Spring Training.” - Eddie Oropesa on his time in the minors (DBE translation and adaptation from Spanish)\nOropesa remembers his time in the minors in the Dodgers’ and Giants’ organizations as frustrating. He pitches a while in Taiwan for “good money”, but things turn around a bit when he meets pitching coach Gus Gregson while playing for Águilas in the Dominican Winter League. Gregson recommends Eddie Oropesa to the Philadelphia Phillies where he gets an invitation to Spring Training.\nTo much of his own surprise he makes the team out of Spring Training 2001.\n“I wasn’t accustomed to the pressure of journalists and I remember that in the final week all of them were asking me over and over if I had made the team. I couldn’t cope with that tension and didn’t sleep for days. On the final day I had to see Bowa (manager) and the General Manager and I thought they would cut me, but no, I had made the team. I couldn’t believe it, after all this time and so many deceptions I finally did it. I started crying like a child.” - Eddie Oropesa on making the major leagues (DBE translation and adaptation from Spanish)\nThe lefty makes his debut on April 2nd in a scoreless inning against the Marlins, in Miami, a day with many emotions for Oropesa and his family, all living in Miami now. For Philadelphia he becomes the most used lefty reliever that season, although mainly in low leverage situations, but finishes with a 4.74 ERA despite going scoreless in 25 of 30 appearances.\nThe Phillies decide to part ways with Oropesa at the end of the 2001 season, probably due to his command problems. He has an 8.1 BB/9 with the Phillies, a bad omen for those that believe that walks are a problem. According to a man with brain that wrote his Wikipedia page, this might be due to his awkward delivery: a high leg kick and wind up when facing righties, while having a lower leg kick and lower arm slot while facing lefties.\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks sign Oropesa in 2002. He makes the team out of Spring Training, albeit not necessarily as a lefty specialist as Bob Brenley would explain: “they both [Mike Myers and Eddie Oropesa, DBE] have such an unorthodox delivery that hitters, right-handed or left-handed, aren’t used to seeing. They both have tremendous movement on their pitches.” \nDuring the months of April and May he is often used in middle relief but from time to time shows his inability of throwing strikes. By the end of May he is demoted to Tucson after giving up 8 total runs in 5 consecutive games.\nHe makes it back to the team at the end of August until that terrible appearance that was referenced in one of the first quotes in this article, a 19-1 loss to Los Angeles Dodgers, where the team that drafted Oropesa feasted on him with 10 runs in 1.2 innings of relief.\nThe Cuban returns for the 2003 season to Arizona. Although he is shuffled up and down between Phoenix and Tucson, he pretty much appears all season for the Diamondbacks. Surely he would have been a great fit on the 2004 Arizona Diamondbacks, and maybe one of the better performers (who knows), but team and pitcher part ways and he signs with the Padres. \nIn San Diego he becomes the first pitcher to get a win at the new Petco Park, but other than that his 2004 major league season already ends in May, with a 12.00 ERA. After that he tries to return to the major leagues with the Cubs and Orioles, but ends up pitching in The Netherlands. After the 2007 season he pretty much ends his playing career and does several coaching jobs.\nCuba libre.\nRecently Oropesa has become a lobbyist of admitting a team of “free” Cuban players in the World Baseball Classic. On the other hand he is also trying to convince the MLB and MLBPA of the importance of creating a specific program for Cuban players that enter professional baseball. His experiences of working with several major league teams on their Cuban players has shown the importance of such a program. \nOne of the players he worked with in the past is former Diamondback Yoan López, and we get a glimpse of how that might have been when Oropesa recollects his memories of working with Yasiel Puig.\n“If someone marked me, that would be Yasiel Puig. He is the classic example of the character distortion one takes with him from Cuba. First of all, the education system, that is like a small prison, and if you don’t learn how to defend yourself, they don’t respect you. In the MLB they then treat you like a king, and they get spoiled. And with those multimillionaire contracts a weak mind like Puig’s might make one think you are God. When they called me to work with Puig, I had already seen his behaviour and I told the Dodgers that I thought he wasn’t going to listen to me. I explained the organisation’s president Steve Carnes the problems and lack of education Puig was carrying with him. I told them that I had never seen anyone behave like Puig did in an AA clubhouse and that he wasn’t going to be different in the MLB. Now he is 31 years old and out of the MLB despite the talent he has and despite the advice I gave him.” - Eddie Oropesa on working with Yasiel Puig while he was a Dodger (DBE translation and adaptation from Spanish)\nMaybe that makes the accomplishment of Eddie Oropesa even bigger.\n\nNOTE: there is quite some information on Edilberto Oropesa on the internet, but most of the information I used for this article is from this unique source (linked in the quotes) that is a very extensive and terrific interview in Spanish with the former Diamondbacks’ pitcher and was just too good to not use it for this article.",

        "description": "The Cubs announced a series of transactions as part of the expansion of active rosters from 26 to 28 players. Infielder David Bote was recalled from Triple-A Iowa, while pitchers Justin Steele and Adrian Sampson were reinstated from the restricted list after missing the team&#8217;s series in Toronto. Jeremiah Estrada and Brendon Little had each been brought up as temporary substitutes for that series.\nLittle has been returned to the minor leagues and will not occupy a spot on the 40-man roster, but Chicago is keeping Estrada with the big league club. His contract has been formally selected, and he now occupies a permanent 40-man spot. To create room on the roster, the Cubs transferred starter Wade Miley from the 15-day to the 60-day injured list.\nEstrada, 23, made his first MLB appearance on Tuesday, tossing a scoreless inning out of the bullpen. He struck out two while averaging a blistering 98.1 MPH on his fastball. The right-hander has had a strong season in the minors, working 48 1/3 frames across three levels. He has a cumulative 1.30 ERA with a massive 40.4% strikeout percentage, although his 10.4% walk rate is a bit worrisome. The former sixth-round pick clearly has high-octane stuff and has shown himself capable of missing bats in the minors, and he&#8217;ll now get a month to audition for a spot in next year&#8217;s season-opening bullpen.\nMiley&#8217;s transfer is a formality that won&#8217;t affect his recovery window. Out since mid-June with a shoulder strain, he&#8217;s already spent more than 60 days on the injured list and will be eligible for reinstatement when he&#8217;s ready. An impending free agent, Miley has maintained he plans to make it back to the majors this season to showcase his form before he hits the open market. The club hopes he can begin a minor league rehab assignment this week, tweets Maddie Lee of the Chicago Sun-Times.",

        "description": "PC, Xbox, smartphones; Half MermaidThis fascinating game provides an interactive film trilogy, complete with behind-the-scenes footage, to help solve the mystery of missing movie star Marissa MarcelIn the late 1960s, Marissa Marcel was an actor on the brink of Hollywood success. Beautiful, young and talented, she was selected from thousands in an open casting to star in a famous (and famously mean) director’s hypersexual arthouse-cinema adaptation of an 18th-century gothic horror novel. But the resultant movie was never released – and neither was her next picture. Marissa disappeared for years, resurfacing for a comeback role in the 1990s in another movie that never made it to theatres, before vanishing for good.What happened to her, and what was going on behind the scenes of her unusual life? Presented with an archive of footage, you have the opportunity to comb through it all and try to find out. You’ll watch these three fictional movies out of order, piecing them gradually together, flitting between clips by highlighting a face or an object, which will then take you to another clip in which it appears. You can rewind and take screenshots to remind you of important moments, and I was writing down off-camera comments in a notebook.Immortality is an extraordinary thing, a documentation of a fictional film career replete with period detail. You will believe that you are rifling through real rushes from unreleased films, seeing real actors and directors and crews working the magic that creates cinema.Immortality is out now; £15.49 (or included with Xbox Game Pass) Continue reading...",

        "description": "This show is a rerun.\nThis week sees the opening of The End of the Tour, an updated My Dinner with Andre about David Foster Wallace’s book tour in 1996 for his immeasurable novel, Infinite Jest.\nOn that tour Wallace stopped by our old show, The Connection, and put forward a pitch: his America — better protected, educated, and entertained than ever — was entering a sad spiritual drift. And as a recovering addict, he hoped to help himself (and others) to grope toward inward peace amid the buzz of the coming 21st-century culture.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm_u3YoL8s8\nIt’s now almost 20 years later. Is there a chance Wallace, who died in 2008, was right?\nHis masterpiece novel, Infinite Jest, what we took to be manic imagination now looks like prophesy: it was hung up on lethally good amusement long before screen addiction became a national anxiety and people dropped dead at their keyboards in Asian arcades. Wallace foresaw about the paralyzing strangeness of watching yourself in HD; now we have the selfie stick. He thought virtual-reality porn could destroy civilization as we know it — and now that&#8217;s available in prototype (the link is news, but still not safe for work!).\nThe president Wallace imagined in Infinite Jest’s near future? Johnny Gentle, a dried-up celebrity-turned-wall-building-germaphobe intent on shooting American waste into space. Gentle wins on “a surreal union of both Rush L.- and Hillary R.C.-disillusioned fringes… an angry reactionary voter-spasm.” In other words, he’s Donald Trump.\nSo, as Trump steps in and Jon Stewart steps out of a long career of laughing ruefully at all the bad news — maybe much of what we’re going through is somewhere inside Wallace&#8217;s long body of work, a one-man epic of irony, sincerity, mania, depression, addiction and forbearance.\nA.O. Scott, chief film critic at the New York Times, told us Wallace captured the new voices inside American heads better than anybody else:\nHe was writing in fairly early days of the Internet and in advance of a lot of the digital culture that we now tend to blame for our alienation and loneliness and melancholy… I think that that sadness, that melancholy, that sense of a disconnection, of a perpetual un-fulfillment is a condition of modern life that renews itself in every generation and in every new technological dispensation&#8230; He was a very precise mimic in a way of a certain style of consciousness that is still very much with us and has if anything, intensified as the artifice and the addictive power of television has been supplanted and trumped by the addictive power of all these other screens that we now have.\nWe were joined by novelist and critic Renata Adler, who mapped that melancholy onto the meta American story, not the media. Postwar triumphalism and &#8220;public happiness&#8221;  gave way to something more paranoid, desperate, and defeated.\nMaria Bustillos,who writes about culture for The Awl and The New Yorker, ventured that the latest phase of web living has us almost &#8220;lethally selfish,&#8221; comfortable with markets and politics that ignore real-world strife.  But, Bustillos says the heady, town-hall spirit of early blogger time isn&#8217;t lost forever; she still sees &#8220;a humanity rising up&#8221; in the Internet and its young users.\nAnd Paul Ford — writer, programmer, and public intellectual of the web — agreed with his pal Maria. Ford points to their own web friendship (and even to Tinder!) to say that there is life on and off the web:\nIt’s remarkable that you put Maria and me both on this program. We have been chatting ambiently for years. When she comes to New York City, we go out and get coffee, and she gives big, strong tremendous hugs! There is an emerging physicality and sense of literal human touch that I think actually the Internet enabled&#8230; I live in this building far out in Brooklyn and we’ve all moved in there with our kids, and half the people in there met online. There is more physicality. There are more people meeting up, more people finding spaces for each other as a result, at the ground level.",

        "description": "The new fascism in Bucks County requires an appropriate response, but are we seeing it?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCentral Bucks School District made national headlines by approving a policy that requires the superintendent and his designees to review books before school libraries offer them. Pennridge School District is considering an even more authoritarian policy. These policies’ purpose, we should be clear, is to prevent whole communities of children from receiving the nourishing recognition they need to survive and thrive in our society. While venues such as this one and groups of parents and students are speaking out against the book bans, there&#8217;s a powerful echelon of Bucks County society that has been silent: capital.\n\n\n\n\nThe @CourierTimes Fails Readers w/ Its @CBSDSchools Book (Banning) Policy Editorial | Editor @cmychalejko writes that regardless of intentions, the editorial defends the indefensible &amp; provides cover for other #BucksCounty school districts to do the same. https://t.co/g9OJxIbP6o&mdash; BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) August 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\nAccording to public documents, the Central Bucks School District did a $13.8 million bond deal last year. A lot of money changes hands when school districts do deals like this on the municipal bond market. While we&#8217;re not accustomed to thinking about public school districts as commodities bought and sold in private markets, to get the financing they need to plug gaps during the budget cycle and pay for things like facilities projects, districts have to sell themselves and pay high fees, credit ratings, and interest rates to do it. When this happens, there&#8217;s a bevy of capitalists and attendant legal advisors who make money.\n\n\n\nREAD: Astroturfing In Central Bucks School District: Moms For Liberty And Book Bans\n\n\n\nIn the most recent bond deal, PFM financial advisors, JP Morgan, and Wells Fargo were banks and financial consultants involved, while Begley, Carlin, and Mandio LLP and King, Spry, Herman, Freund, and Faul LLC did legal work for it. In total, the consultants and advisors made $114,204.45 from the deal. Due to the secrecy of private credit markets we can&#8217;t know exactly how much JP Morgan and Wells Fargo made by serving as the go-between for the district and it&#8217;s lenders, though we know that they report a $1.95 million premium. Nor can we know the names of the wealthy fixed-income investors who stand to make tax-free 5% coupon payments in this deal, with interest on this loan totaling around $700,000.\n\n\n\n\nNow that @CBSDSchools has ripped down #LGBTQI flags &amp; is set to pass #book banning policy, what&#39;s next? Curriculum. @ProfesoraLMO&#39;s essay warns #BucksCounty what&#39;s possibly ahead. Words Matter: How The Right Wing Promotes Fascism Through School Curriculumhttps://t.co/qZ6eIB4ge8&mdash; BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) July 26, 2022\n\n\n\n\nWhile we tend to think taxpayers are the ones that pay for public schooling, it&#8217;s actually finance capitalists that provide and circulate the necessary funds – tax payer money just pays these capitalists back for the service. These wealthy elites provide the district with its financial lifeblood.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nREAD: Educational Gag Orders Threaten Our Future, Freedom\n\n\n\nI imagine if JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, PFM, and Begley and King really disagreed with the new fascism in Bucks County, they would refuse to do business with the district. If there were such a capital strike, I also imagine the fascists in the district would think twice about banning books. However, no statement or op-ed or even private communication is known to the public along these lines. Will the big banks and regional financiers stand for fascism in their midst?\n\n\n\nAt Pennridge, there&#8217;s an even more recent deal that went down for $8.3 million. PNC Capital Markets was the banker here, while Dinsmore and Shohl, LLP are the bond counsels providing legal advice. They&#8217;re making $104,088 on the deal with a $978,000 premium. As Pennridge decides to surveil student communications with an eye towards excluding whole communities of students from our shared social life, will the bankers and lawyers keep taking their money?\n\n\n\nREAD: Pennridge School District’s Proposed Policy On Student Expression Is ‘Extreme’ And ‘Unconstitutional\n\n\n\nI would hope not. But it&#8217;s hard to turn down millions of dollars in fees and tax-free interest payments, even if that money comes from a school district systematically oppressing its own kids. As communities stand up and fight back against this tide of immoral, unethical, and mis-educative educational policy I hope we remember this crucial choke point if the region&#8217;s elites won&#8217;t stand up and do the right thing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile there are no active campaigns underway along these lines, if you&#8217;re interested in working on these kinds of issues, particularly putting progressive pressure on political leaders in the region, look into joining BuxMont Democratic Socialists of America, Pennsylvania Debt Collective, and PA Stands Up.",

        "description": "Photo by Quinn Harris/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Royals left a small army on the bases It is no hidden fact that the Royals hit better at home than on the road. As a team, Kansas City is slashing a full 59 points lower on the road than at home. And after scoring nine runs on Tuesday and 15 runs on Sunday, the offense again came to a screeching halt in a 7-1 loss to the White Sox. The Royals also stranded 17 men on base. \nAfter scoring 24 combined runs on Sunday and Tuesday, Kansas City scored just three runs across the final two games of its series against the South Siders.\nDaniel Mengden got his first start of the season as one of two September call ups, along with Nate Eaton. He started cleanly in his first two innings, capped off by an incredibly catch by Drew Waters in right center field to rob AJ Pollock of a home run.\nWaters continued returning the favor by leading off the very next half inning with a single into right. He moved to third on a Nicky Lopez single and scored on MJ Melendez’s fielder’s choice, putting the Royals up 1-0. \nThe lead didn’t last long, with Mengden running into trouble in the bottom half. Leury Garcia led off with a single and scored on Elvis Andrus’ single after a wild pitch moved him to 2nd. Andrew Vaughn put there very next pitch over the fence in left, giving Chicago a 3-1 lead. \nMike Matheny had to go get him after just 2.2 innings pitched when he followed up the homer by giving up a double and a walk. Collin Snider relieved him and got Yasmani Grandal to ground out to limit the damage. \nThe start was Mengden’s first since July of 2020, where he went four innings for the A’s against the Rockies. It was the first time since September of 2016 that he failed to escape the 3rd inning of a start and just the 2nd time in his career. Mengden ended the day having given up three runs on five hits. \nJohnny Cueto cruised through his first four innings before running into some trouble in the 5th. Waters led off the inning with a double, but was thrown out trying to take third on a Lopez groundout. Melendez singled and moved to 2nd on an errant throw, giving the Royals runners on 2nd and 3rd with one out. However, two softish lineouts from Bobby Witt Jr and Salvador Perez ended the threat.\nKansas City put another threat together the very next inning, with a leadoff error and a walk bringing the tying run to the plate. A weak popout from pinch hitter Ryan O’Hearn, along with a softly hit groundout from Lopez with the bases loaded ended the inning. \nThe White Sox made the Royals pay for the missed opportunities the next inning, tagging Brad Keller and Jose Cuas for two runs, increasing the lead to 5-1. They added two more insurance runs in the 8th for good measure on AJ Pollock’s two-run homer and Chicago’s bullpen shut the door, securing the 7-1 win and the series. White Sox relievers struck out 18 Royals, the 4th highest total in a nine inning game all season.\nThe loss drops Kansas City to 53-79, while the White Sox improve to just one game below .500 at 65-66. they’re still just 4.5 games back of Cleveland in the AL Central. \nUp Next: Royals at Tigers, Friday, September 2, 6:10 PM CDT, Comerica Park. LHP Daniel Lynch (4-9, 4.70 ERA) v. RHP Drew Hutchison (2-7, 4.01 ERA)",

        "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A retired New York Police Department officer was sentenced on Thursday to 10 years in prison for&nbsp;attacking the U.S. Capitol&nbsp;and using a metal flagpole to assault one of the police officers trying to hold off a mob of&nbsp;Donald Trump&nbsp;supporters.\n\n\n\nThomas Webster's prison sentence is the longest so far among roughly 250 people who have been punished for their conduct during the riot on Jan. 6, 2021. The previous longest was&nbsp;shared by two other rioters, who were sentenced separately to seven years and three months in prison.\n\n\n\nWebster, a 20-year NYPD veteran, was the first Capitol riot defendant to be tried on an assault charge and the first to present a self-defense argument. A jury rejected Webster's claim that he was defending himself when he tackled Metropolitan Police Department officer Noah Rathbun and grabbed his gas mask outside the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sentenced Webster, 56, to 10 years in prison plus three years of supervised release, noting that along with Rathbun, “the other victim was democracy.\" He allowed Webster to report to prison at a date to be determined instead of immediately ordering him into custody.\n\n\n\nFederal prosecutors had recommended a prison sentence of 17 years and six months. The court’s probation department had recommended a 10-year prison sentence. Mehta wasn't bound by the recommendations.\n\n\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors accused Webster of “disgracing a democracy that he once fought honorably to protect and serve.” Webster led the charge against police barricades at the Capitol’s Lower West Plaza, prosecutors said. They compared the attack to a medieval battle, with rioters pelting officers with makeshift projectiles and engaging in hand-to-hand combat.\n\n\n\n“Each individual attack on an officer at the West Plaza weakened the defensive line, fueled the crowd, and brought the rioters one step closer toward disrupting our democracy,” they wrote.\n\n\n\nDefense attorney James Monroe said Webster was “swept up in the fervor of the large crowd” but didn't join many other rioters in entering the Capitol. Monroe said the mob was “guided by unscrupulous politicians\" and others&nbsp;promoting the lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen&nbsp;from the Republican incumbent.\n\n\n\n“These forces championed by former President Donald Trump exerted an extraordinary amount of influence over those Americans present at the Capitol on Jan. 6 though their relentless disinformation,” Monroe wrote.\n\n\n\nIn May, jurors deliberated for less than three hours before they&nbsp;convicted Webster of all six counts&nbsp;in his indictment, including a charge that he assaulted Rathbun with a dangerous weapon, the flagpole.\n\n\n\nAlso Thursday, a New Jersey man pleaded guilty to using pepper spray on police officers, including one who later died. Officer Brian Sicknick suffered a stroke the day after the riot and died of natural causes. He and other officers were standing guard behind metal bicycle racks as the mob of pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol.\n\n\n\nJulian Khater, 33, pleaded guilty to two counts of assaulting or impeding officers with a dangerous weapon. He could face up to 20 years in prison, though will likely face a sentence ranging from about 6 1/2 to 8 years at a hearing set for December.\n\n\n\nThe case against Khater and a second man have been among the more notable brought by the Justice Department. George Pierre Tanios brought the pepper spray in a backpack. Tanios previously pleaded guilty and is also set to be sentenced in December.\n\n\n\nWebster had testified at trial that he was trying to protect himself from a “rogue cop” who punched him in the face. He also accused Rathbun of instigating the confrontation.\n\n\n\nRathbun testified that he didn’t punch or pick a fight with Webster. Rathbun said he was trying to move Webster back from a security perimeter that he and other officers were struggling to maintain.\n\n\n\nRathbun’s body camera captured Webster shouting profanities and insults before they made any physical contact. The video shows that Webster slammed one of the bike racks at Rathbun before the officer reached out with an open left hand and struck the right side of Webster’s face.\n\n\n\nAfter Rathbun struck his face, Webster swung a metal flag pole at the officer in a downward chopping motion, striking a bike rack. Rathbun grabbed the broken pole from Webster, who charged at the officer, tackled him to the ground and grabbed his gas mask, choking him by the chin strap.\n\n\n\nWebster drove alone to Washington, D.C., from his home near Goshen, New York, on the eve of the Jan. 6 “Stop the Steal” rally, where Trump addressed thousands of supporters. Webster was wearing a bulletproof vest and carrying a Marine Corps flag on a metal pole when he joined the mob that stormed the Capitol.\n\n\n\nWebster said he went to the Capitol to “petition” lawmakers to “relook” at the results of the 2020 presidential election. But he testified that he didn’t intend to interfere with Congress’ joint session to certify President&nbsp;Joe Biden&nbsp;'s victory.\n\n\n\nWebster retired from the NYPD in 2011 after 20 years of service, which included a stint on then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s private security detail. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1985 to 1989 before joining the NYPD in 1991.",

Trump&nbsp;said&nbsp;he would be looking \"very seriously\" into full pardons for those charged in connection with storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, if he decides to run for a second term and wins the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with conservative radio host Wendy Bell on Thursday, Trump further stated that he would&nbsp;consider it \"very strongly and very favorably.\"\n\n\n\nThe 45th president also shared that he was \"financially supporting\" some of the defendants who were in his office&nbsp;just days ago.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I am financially supporting people that are incredible and they were in my office actually two days ago, so they’re very much in my mind,” Trump added.\n\n\n\n“It’s a disgrace what they’ve done to them. What they’ve done to these people is disgraceful,\" he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Trump teased a potential 2024 run for the presidency, he stopped short of announcing it during the interview.\n\n\n\nWhen asked by Bell if he would announce his run on the show, the former president&nbsp;shared, \"Well the time is coming closer and I think you're gonna be really happy. You have campaign finance laws that [don't] allow you to ... it's crazy. It's not smart. If you say it, everything changes and you have reporting and you have all things. But I will be doing something and I think you're going to be happy.\"\n\n\n\nA Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to The Hill's request for comment on how exactly he is supporting the Jan. 6, 2021, riot defendants. \n\n\n\nTrump's comments come on the same day that President&nbsp;Biden is&nbsp;set to deliver a prime-time speech&nbsp;from Philadelphia about protecting democracy, in which he will warn that Americans’ rights and freedoms are “under attack,” according to a White House official. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s unclear whether Biden will explicitly mention Trump during his Thursday address, but plans for the speech suggest he'll at least allude to the former president and his false claims about the 2020 election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe former president reiterated recent comments he made at&nbsp;a Faith and Freedom event&nbsp;in Nashville, Tenn.,&nbsp;last month where he said the defendants charged in the Capitol riot had their \"lives destroyed,\" claiming that most had been “charged with parading through the Capitol.”\n\n\n\nTrump's comments calling for pardons have also been criticized by his close allies, most prominently by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who shared that he&nbsp;thought the idea of offering pardons to Capitol riot defendants&nbsp;was “inappropriate.” The former president responded,&nbsp;calling the South Carolina Republican a “RINO,”&nbsp;or “Republican in name only.”\n\n\n\nTo date, more than 860 people across the country have been arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 riot. More than 350 have pleaded guilty to a variety of crimes.&nbsp;More than 115 have been incarcerated for their role in the riot.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Photo by Nick Cammett/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Gunnar plays short, Bradish takes the mound, and Aguilar debuts for the Birds. Let’s get this series! Storylines abound in the rubber match of this three-game set in Cleveland. \nGunnar Henderson moves up slightly in the batting order and makes his first big league appearance at shortstop. Related to that, Jorge Mateo gets a day off, giving the Orioles the ultimate baserunning weapon in a tight game.\nRight after Henderson in the order is new slugger Jesús Aguilar, recently signed following a dreadful season with the Marlins. The Orioles will be hoping that Aguilar can recapture whatever it was that made him a 111 OPS+ hitter a season ago and bring it to a lineup that needs a jolt.\nKyle Bradish takes the hill, looking to replicate his most recent start. That is when he tossed eight shutout innings against the vaunted Houston Astros. August was his finest month in the big leagues so far. Let’s hope that magic carries into the first day of September.\nOpposing the rookie is his future teammate, Shane Bieber. The 27-year-old could be on the trade block this winter. He has two seasons of team control remaining, but Cleveland has made a habit of trading away the never-ending supply of quality arms in recent years. Baltimore could be shopping for an ace soon, and they have plenty of prospect capital to swing a deal.\nBieber’s fastball velocity has decreased for a second consecutive season, but he remains a force on the mound, and he is coming off of an outstanding month of August.\nOrioles Starting Lineup\n\nCedric Mullins, CF\nAdley Rutschman, C\nAnthony Santander, RF\nRamón Urías, 3B\nGunnar Henderson, SS\nJesús Aguilar, DH\nRyan Mountcastle, 1B\nRougned Odor, 2B\nTerrin Vavra, LF\n\nKyle Bradish, RHP (2-5, 5.63 ERA)\nGuardians Starting Lineup\n\nSteven Kwan, LF\nAmed Rosario, SS\nJosé Ramírez, 3B\nJosh Naylor, 1B\nOscar Gonzalez, RF\nAndrés Giménez, 2B\nOwen Miller, DH\nAustin Hedges, C\nMyles Straw, CF\n\nShane Bieber, RHP (8-7, 3.02 ERA)",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/astros-designate-niko-goodrum-peter-solomon-for-assignment.html",
        "description": "The Astros announced that utiltiyman Niko Goodrum and right-hander Peter Solomon have been designated for assignment. The moves were necessary to clear a pair of 40-man roster spots for prospects Hunter Brown and Yainer Diaz, both of whom have had their contracts selected to make their major league debuts. Brown&#8217;s and Diaz&#8217;s promotions were first reported on Monday.\nGoodrum signed a $2.1MM free agent deal during Spring Training. The 30-year-old had been non-tendered by the Tigers on the heels of a .214/.292/.359 showing, but Houston took a flier to add him to the bench. Goodrum had posted roughly league average production as Detroit&#8217;s primary shortstop between 2018-19, and he offered an intriguing blend of speed, defensive flexibility and some power upside. Swing-and-miss was a concern, but Goodrum was a potential veteran fallback in case rookie shortstop Jeremy Peña faltered in his first look at MLB pitching.\nPeña hit the ground running, though, seizing the primary shortstop job out of the gate. Relegated to a reserve role, Goodrum appeared in only 15 MLB games and had an awful showing at the plate. He struck out in 23 of his 45 plate appearances (51.1% rate) and was optioned to Triple-A Sugar Land in the middle of May. The switch-hitter got out to a hot start there, but he landed on the injured list after just two weeks. Goodrum wasn&#8217;t reinstated until August 11 and has played in only 13 Triple-A games this season.\nThe Astros fairly modest investment clearly didn&#8217;t pan out as hoped, and they&#8217;ve decided to take Goodrum off the roster entirely. He&#8217;ll be placed on outright waivers or released in the next week. It&#8217;s probable he&#8217;ll pass through waivers unclaimed, as any claiming team would take on the approximate $400K left on his contract for the final five weeks of the season. That&#8217;s not an especially onerous sum, but it seems unlikely another team would want to assume it with Goodrum amidst a third straight rough campaign.\nAs a player with more than three years of major league service time, Goodrum would have the right to refuse an outright assignment in favor of minor league free agency if he clears waivers. He has less than five years of MLB service, however, meaning he&#8217;d be forfeiting his remaining guaranteed salary to do so. It&#8217;s quite possible, then, that he&#8217;ll stick in Sugar Land for the stretch run without occupying a 40-man spot.\nSolomon, 26, has six MLB appearances under his belt. Those all came out of the bullpen last season, with the right-hander working 14 innings as a long relief arm. He allowed only two runs in that time, but his 10:8 strikeout-to-walk ratio wasn&#8217;t especially impressive. Solomon had a much better 26.3% strikeout rate in Triple-A last year, though, and Baseball America named him the #10 prospect in the Astros system entering the 2022 campaign.\nBA wrote that Solomon&#8217;s five-pitch mix of generally solid offerings, paired with decent control, made him a viable back-of-the-rotation starter. With Houston&#8217;s enviable stockpile of starting pitching depth, Solomon has spent all of this season back in Triple-A. He&#8217;s worked 97 innings through 23 outings (18 starts) but has a 5.20 ERA that&#8217;s his worst at any level as a professional. Last year&#8217;s above-average strikeout percentage has fallen to a pedestrian 20.5%, and he&#8217;s walking batters at a higher than ideal 10.2% clip. Solomon has still induced ground-balls at an intriguing 47% rate, but his generally middle-of-the-road showing this year squeezed him off the 40-man roster.\nSolomon will also land on waivers in the coming days, and it&#8217;s possible another team without as much starting pitch depth as Houston has puts in a claim. The Notre Dame product isn&#8217;t far removed from being a prospect of some regard, and his pre-2022 track record in the minors was strong. Solomon is also only in his second option year, meaning any team that is willing to devote him a 40-man spot could move him between the majors and Triple-A both this season and next.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/diamondbacks-select-wilmer-difo-designate-noe-ramirez.html",
        "description": "The Diamondbacks announced they&#8217;ve selected infielder Wilmer Difo onto the big league roster. They&#8217;ve also reinstated relievers Keynan Middleton and Kyle Nelson from the 15-day injured list. To create space on the active and 40-man rosters, Arizona designated right-hander Noé Ramirez for assignment.\nDifo gets his first MLB crack of the year, reaching the big leagues for what&#8217;ll be an eighth straight season. A switch-hitting middle infielder, Difo has decent contact skills but doesn&#8217;t offer much in the way of power production. He&#8217;s a .251/.313/.355 hitter in exactly 1300 MLB plate appearances split between the Nationals and Pirates, with the vast majority of that time coming in Washington. Difo has ample experience all throughout the infield, and he&#8217;s generally rated well in the eyes of public defensive metrics as a shortstop.\nIt&#8217;s been a similar story in Triple-A Reno this year. The 30-year-old has logged plenty of action at shortstop and third base, and he&#8217;s compiled a .269/.311/.398 line over 306 trips to the plate. Difo has struck out in just 13.4% of his plate appearances, but his lack of extra-base impact has been glaring in one of the more hitter-friendly environments in affiliated ball. He&#8217;ll nevertheless get a look on the strength of his glove, offering manager Torey Lovullo a defensive specialist off the bench for the stretch run. Difo will be arbitration-eligible this winter and could be kept around for next season, although he&#8217;s a likelier non-tender candidate given his journeyman status and below-average offensive showing in Triple-A.\nNelson and Middleton have each missed over a month dealing with injuries: back spasms for Nelson, an ankle strain for Middleton. The former has made 38 appearances during his first season in the desert, working to a sparkling 1.57 ERA in 34 1/3 innings but only striking out 20.5% of opponents. The latter has only pitched 12 times, pitching to a 1.64 ERA with a 25% strikeout rate in 11 frames.\nWith Nelson and Middleton returning to the bullpen, the D-Backs had to cut one of their incumbent pitchers. (Teams must devote one of the two extra roster spots in September to a position player). The veteran Ramirez finds himself as the odd man out after posting a lackluster 5.22 ERA through 50 innings. Ramirez has punched out 23.7% of batters faced on a solid 11.8% swinging strike percentage, but he&#8217;s also walked batters at an alarming 12.1% clip.\nThe 32-year-old Ramirez spent most of last season in Arizona as well. He signed a minor league deal after being released by the Angels and made the big league roster in June. Ramirez impressed enough down the stretch the D-Backs agreed to bring him back on a $1.25MM salary. They weren&#8217;t prepared to do so again this winter, and they&#8217;ll now place him on waivers in the next couple days.\nIf no other team wants to assume the remaining $240K on his contract, Ramirez is likely to head to the open market. He has more than five years of major league service time, giving him the right to refuse an outright assignment in favor of free agency while still collecting the remainder of his guaranteed salary.",

        "title": "Infrequently Asked Fair Questions: What happens to all the money at the State Fair?",
        "link": "https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/09/01/infrequently-asked-fair-questions-what-happens-to-all-the-money-at-the-state-fair",
        "description": "There’s a lot of money at the fair. Beyond the cash and cards used by visitors, vendors have to pay for their business spaces. In this edition of Infrequently Asked Questions, MPR News Reporter Tim Nelson traces the fair-wide money flow.How much the fair makes a year?First, it’s not the same every year. There are a lot of moving financial parts to the fair, including everything from off-season rentals to retirement plan investments. But for instance, in the last big pre-pandemic year, the fair took in about $63 million in revenue. The biggest chunk of this comes from the tickets that more than 2 million people buy. The ticket price ranged from $12 to $17 this year. In 2019, ticket sales totaled about $40 million. It costs the fair more than that to open the gates, with everything from manure removal to staffing the ticket booths to free park and ride bus transportation. Just a side note here on the tickets: Back in the day, they used to actually count the tickets — and calculate the daily attendance by weighing the ticket stubs. With a scale. That’s how many there were. Now, every ticket, paper and electronic, has a bar code that gets scanned.The next biggest chunk of fair money comes from what are called activities: concessions, booth rental, animal forage fees, exhibit licenses — a ton of different categories all contribute to the fair’s bottom line in slightly different ways.What do vendors pay?They agree to pay 15 percent commission. There’s no rent, the fees just come off the top of their revenue.How does the fair know how much these folks are taking in?That is a very good question. Because strictly speaking, they don’t. And that is one of the invisible secrets of the State Fair. I put that same question to general manager Jerry Hammer. Here’s what he told me:“We do have auditors that go around booth to booth during the fair and they will go over to each stand at the fair two, three or four times, at different times of day, different days of the week just to get a good handle on [the income]. Unless you’re a brand new vendor, we&#x27;ve got a really good long history so we know what to expect based on what&#x27;s going on elsewhere.”So, while you are noshing on that corn dog – there may very well be someone standing there, watching you do it and counting. There is really such a thing as a State Fair Auditor.So, the vendors just add up their sales and hand over 15 percent at the end of the fair?Actually, they have to do it: Every. Single. Day. The fair doesn’t want to get into the details, for security reasons, but all these vendors have to literally check in, in person and hand over the money daily. That’s how the fair monitors the flow of money and makes sure that vendors don’t forget, or buy something and not have the money to pay at the end. There are slightly more than 300 food stands, they sell between $4 million to $5.5 million of product a day and they have to give the fair its cut. In person. Every day.And what about stands that don’t sell food?There’s a couple different categories. A shop that sells shirts or hats or cat toys or any merchandise pays a flat fee per foot of frontage they have — so that’s $130 a foot. So a 10-foot booth would pay $1,300 for the whole fair. Booths that don’t actually stock what they sell, like home improvement gear or pickup trucks, they pay a little less and non-profits and educational exhibits get an even bigger discount — a little under $100 a foot. There are agreements for midway rides and all kinds of other variations, but that’s basically how it works. And it’s a lot of money, but remember: Target corporation made $106 billion last year with about 19 hundred stores — for about $55 million of revenue a year per store. So for all the superlatives the fair is probably not that different from a Super Target — just open only for a week and a half.",

        "description": "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) committee on Thursday recommended updated COVID-19 vaccine boosters for people 12 and older, helping clear the way for a fall campaign for the shots.  \n\n\n\nOnce CDC Director Rochelle Walensky gives the final sign off, which is expected soon, the vaccinations can begin.  \n\n\n\nThe vote passed 13-1, with one member, Dr. Pablo Sanchez of Ohio State University, voting no over a concern about&nbsp;lacking&nbsp;enough human data on the updated shots.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe updated shots were designed to specifically target the subvariants of omicron that&nbsp;are&nbsp;currently circulating, known as BA.4 and BA.5, as well as the original virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy updating for the latest evolutions in the virus, the shots are intended to be more effective than the original vaccines, though the older vaccines still provide important protection against severe illness.  \n\n\n\nAs long as people have received the first two shots, it has been at least two months since their last dose and they are aged 12 or older, they are eligible for the new updated booster dose.  \n\n\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday that the campaign of administering the new shots, from both Pfizer and Moderna, is expected to&nbsp;begin&nbsp;“in earnest to eligible people shortly after Labor Day.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a bid to keep up with changes in the virus, the Food and Drug Administration&nbsp;(FDA) on Wednesday authorized the updated vaccines without waiting for the full clinical trials to be completed, which did provoke some discussion at the CDC meeting, with Sanchez in particular expressing concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the&nbsp;FDA&nbsp;and several&nbsp;CDC panel members&nbsp;noted there is a strong safety&nbsp;record from the millions of doses of the original vaccine that have already been given, as well as data from a slightly different tweaked vaccine, and preliminary data for this one.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWaiting would delay administration of the updated vaccines even as the virus continues to take a toll.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe FDA noted that the updates to this vaccine are&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;the process that happens every year for updating the flu vaccine to the latest strains.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The public can be assured that a great deal of care has been taken by the FDA to ensure that these bivalent COVID-19 vaccines meet our rigorous safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality standards for emergency use authorization,” said Peter Marks, a top FDA vaccine official.\n\n\n\nA major question, though, is how many people will actually want the updated booster, given lagging uptake for booster shots of the original vaccine. Only about half of the people who got the first two shots received the initial booster shot, according to CDC data.  \n\n\n\nOfficials are hoping, though, that enough people get the updated booster to provide protection against another wave this fall and winter as the weather gets colder.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“These boosters will be available at tens of thousands of vaccination sites [people have] used previously, including local pharmacies, their physicians' offices, and vaccine centers operated by state and local health officials,” the Department of Health and Human Services said.",

Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love,” Biden is poised to say in Philadelphia, according to advanced excerpts released by the White House.\n\n\n\nThe White House has billed Biden’s speech as one about “the soul of the nation” and the threats facing American democracy. \n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Thursday said the speech would be “optimistic” despite the serious subject matter, and she disputed that it would focus on Trump.\n\n\n\nBut the excerpts make clear Biden will single out the former president’s movement, tying it to recent attacks on law enforcement and the Supreme Court ruling that struck down Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that found a person's right to abortion to be constitutional. \n\n\n\n“So tonight I have come here to the place where it all began to speak plainly to the nation about the threats we face,” Biden will say, according to the excerpts. “About the power we have in our own hands to meet those threats. And about the incredible future that lies in front of us if only we choose it.”\n\n\n\n“For a long time, we’ve reassured ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed,” the excerpt reads. “But it is not. We have to defend it. Protect it. Stand up for it. Each and every one of us.”\n\n\n\nBiden has in recent weeks become more assertive in calling out “MAGA Republicans.” At a political rally last week in Maryland, Biden described the movement as akin to “semi-fascism.”\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday in Pennsylvania, Biden referenced “MAGA Republicans” multiple times as he invoked the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, condemning attacks from some Republicans on law enforcement.\n\n\n\nSome Republicans have criticized Biden for his comments, arguing he campaigned on a pledge to unite the country and lower the temperature of the nation but is using inflammatory rhetoric by comparing conservatives to fascists. \n\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) is giving a speech in Scranton, Pa., hours before Biden to criticize his record and recent comments.",

        "description": "With the post-Labor Day sprint to the midterms days away,&nbsp;President Biden&nbsp;is doubling down on his message that much of the GOP is threatening the nation's democratic values.\n\n\n\nBiden’s speech in Philadelphia on Thursday night is&nbsp;expected to be a denunciation&nbsp;of certain values held by “MAGA Republicans\" following the FBI’s search of former&nbsp;President Trump’s estate in Florida and the Jan. 6 committee’s public hearings.\n\n\n\n\"It's not a political speech,\" White House press secretary&nbsp;Karine Jean-Pierre&nbsp;told reporters in a brief preview. \"It's about this moment we're in.\"\n\n\n\nThursday's speech will likely be an escalation of what was seen in Biden's&nbsp;speech in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on Tuesday, when he first pushed back on Republicans’ rhetoric about defunding the FBI — which some worry could increase political violence — and questioned the morals of lawmakers who defend the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot.\n\n\n\nUp until last month, Biden has largely been on defense, fending off attacks from the GOP about record levels of inflation and high gas prices. But after scoring several legislative victories, including passage of Democrats' sweeping Inflation Reduction Act, the commander in chief is now ramping up his political attacks.\n\n\n\nHe also received backlash from the other side of the aisle&nbsp;when he said&nbsp;many in the GOP shifted to “semi-fascism.”\n\n\n\nPolls suggest that voters are concerned about the state of democracy. An NBC News poll conducted in August found that 21 percent of respondents ranked threats to democracy as the most important issue. \n\n\n\nWelcome to NotedDC: Your guide to politics, policy &amp; people of consequence in D.C. Subscribe here: thehill.com/noted.\n\n\n\nIn today's issue:&nbsp;One Democratic hopeful who's not shying away from the president.\n\n\n\nPlus: GOP tensions over the Senate and the stakes being raised in the House.\n\n\n\nFetterman presses Biden ahead of joint appearance\n\n\n\nPennsylvania Senate candidate&nbsp;John Fetterman&nbsp;(D) is set to appear with President Biden when the president visits the Keystone State over the holiday weekend.\n\n\n\nThe two are slated to appear together at a Labor Day parade in Pittsburgh on Monday. Biden is&nbsp;also visiting&nbsp;the swing state of Wisconsin on Labor Day.The joint appearance comes after Fetterman did not appear at Biden's event in Pennsylvania earlier this week, which Republicans were&nbsp;quick to point out.\n\n\n\nThe stop comes as the Democratic candidate battles his GOP opponent&nbsp;Mehmet Oz, whose campaign has&nbsp;received backlash&nbsp;for going after Fetterman's stroke from May.\n\n\n\nFetterman, who is leading in polls, has&nbsp;pushed Biden&nbsp;on the issue of legalizing marijuana ahead of their appearance on Monday — seeking to tap into an issue that's popular on both sides of the aisle.\n\n\n\nAccording to&nbsp;a CBS News poll&nbsp;conducted in April, two-thirds of Americans want recreational marijuana use to be legal on the federal level. It could also push more young voters to turn out for the lieutenant governor since a majority favor legalization.\n\n\n\nSenators including&nbsp;Elizabeth Warren&nbsp;(D-Mass.) and&nbsp;Bernie Sanders&nbsp;(I-Vt.) have pushed Biden&nbsp;to decriminalize marijuana after he pledged to during his presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nOur colleague Hanna Trudo writes: “For years, Fetterman, Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor and the party’s Senate nominee, has supported the reform he believes will create a fairer criminal justice system. While Biden didn’t address his request directly, Fetterman’s push is the latest way liberals are angling for more influence ahead of the midterms.” \n\n\n\nSenate races cause tension within GOP \n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader&nbsp;Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) comment about the quality of candidates in crucial Senate races is causing tension within the party as they face an uphill battle in flipping the upper chamber red.\n\n\n\nAfter former&nbsp;President Trump&nbsp;called on the GOP to oust McConnell as a leader over the remark, Sen.&nbsp;Rick Scott&nbsp;(R-Fla.) is now&nbsp;adding fuel to the fire&nbsp;in an op-ed published Thursday by the Washington Examiner.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Unfortunately, many of the very people responsible for losing the Senate last cycle are now trying to stop us from winning the majority this time by trash-talking our Republican candidates,” wrote Scott, chair of the Senate Republican fundraising arm, while not directly naming McConnell.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe spat comes as the party looks&nbsp;to hit the reset button on their Senate elections playbook,&nbsp;our colleague Mychael Schnell writes, given the low polling of candidates like&nbsp;Herschel Walker&nbsp;in Georgia,&nbsp;Mehmet Oz&nbsp;in Pennsylvania&nbsp;and&nbsp;Blake Masters&nbsp;in Arizona.\n\n\n\nWhat we’re watching:&nbsp;McConnell previously said he was “all in” on Colorado Republican Senate candidate&nbsp;Joe O’Dea,&nbsp;who is attempting to oust Sen.&nbsp;Michael Bennet&nbsp;(D).&nbsp;According to a new GOP poll&nbsp;released Wednesday, Bennet and O'Dea are neck-and-neck in the state, which has increasingly trended blue.\n\n\n\nRead more about the conflict brewing between Scott and McConnell. \n\n\n\nALASKA RAISES STAKES FOR GOP\n\n\n\nDemocrats’ hopes of minimizing losses in the House are growing stronger, with several races shifting toward Democrats and a seat in Alaska coming into play after the party pulled out a major victory in Tuesday's special election.\n\n\n\nMary Peltola&nbsp;defeated former Alaska Gov.&nbsp;Sarah Palin&nbsp;(R) to become the first Democrat to hold Alaska’s sole congressional seat in decades, replacing the late Rep.&nbsp;Don Young&nbsp;(R).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt was a stunning upset, considering Palin’s recognition in the state and how long the seat was held by a Republican. The win suggests the state’s new ranked-choice voting system could help Democrats and moderate Republicans in November,&nbsp;our colleague Caroline Vakil writes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPalin will still fight Peltola to permanently fill the seat in November. But the Cook Political Report shifted its forecast for the race toward Peltola on Thursday, along with four other competitive House races, signaling the GOP might be in trouble.\n\n\n\nOUTLOOK SHIFTING FOR DEMS\n\n\n\nOur colleague Emily Brooks&nbsp;has a roundup of the five races that the Cook Political Report shifted toward Democrats on Thursday, including notably Virginia’s 7th District, where Rep.&nbsp;Abigail Spanberger&nbsp;(D) faces Republican former police officer&nbsp;Yesli Vega.\n\n\n\nThe seat shifted from “toss-up” to “leans Democratic” after redistricting caused Spanberger to be in a more vulnerable position, moving her out of some areas where she received strong support.Remember:&nbsp;Spanberger railed against members of her own party for using slogans like “defund the police” in 2020, blaming them for costing them bigger gains in the House. She won with a slim margin of 8,000 votes last election cycle.\n\n\n\nThe GOP has been banking on taking back the House, while their chances of taking back the Senate are becoming slimmer. \n\n\n\n💰 Catch up quick: Student loan forgiveness\n\n\n\nThe federal government is preparing to roll out a student loan forgiveness program that will provide up to $20,000 for borrowers saddled with debt.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;Aris Folley&nbsp;has the full breakdown&nbsp;of how to qualify and what steps need to be taken.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresident Biden announced the much-anticipated debt forgiveness plan last month. Federal student loan payments have been paused for more than two years because of the coronavirus pandemic. Biden has continued the pause through the end of the year to give borrowers time to tap into the forgiveness plan. \n\n\n\n🎷 DC Jazz Fest heats up \n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;DC Jazz Festival's 18th annual celebration continues through this weekend with performances across the District.\n\n\n\nThe event runs through Labor Day and the full line-up and ticket sales can be found at the event's website. \n\n\n\nHave some news, juicy gossip, insight or other insider info?

        "description": "Mary Peltola (D), who won the special election for Alaska's lone House seat on Tuesday, is defending the state's newly implemented ranked choice voting system amid GOP criticism.\n\n\n\n“Ranked choice voting is so new to a lot of people. And change is hard, and it doesn't come easy. But I think that, in this regard, change is certainly good and worth the growing pains,” Peltola said in a phone interview with The Hill on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after her upset victory in The Last Frontier. “I do think — I have a lot of faith in ranked choice voting. Eighty-five percent of the time, the person with the most votes is the person who ends up with the seat.”\n\n\n\nPeltola, who will become the first Alaskan Native and first Democrat in decades to represent her state in the House, will fill the remainder of the late Rep. Don Young’s (R-Alaska) term.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe defied expectations after defeating two Republicans — former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) and Nick Begich III, the former co-chair for Young’s 2020 reelection campaign — in a seat that many presumed would be won by a Republican. \n\n\n\nBut the state’s use of a new combination of an open primary system and ranked-choice voting in the general election saw Peltola prevail. The ranked choice voting requires Alaskans to rank the primary's four top vote-getters by preference, with the candidate who receives more than half the votes outright winning the race. \n\n\n\nIf no candidate wins following the initial tabulation of votes, the lowest vote-getter of the four is knocked out and voters who chose the eliminated candidate have their next choice of candidate applied. The process continues until one candidate receives more than half of the vote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“You know, clearly there has been a lot of messaging in the last couple years about — kind of attacking the confidence that we have in our electoral process and our electoral system,” Peltola said. “And Alaska has a very, very solid and … great elections. We have a lot of faith in our elections. And I think it's a disservice to, you know, shoot holes in the confidence that we have in our election.”\n\n\n\nFollowing Peltola's victory, some Republicans criticized the new system. Palin issued a statement saying “[ranked]-choice voting was sold as the way to make elections better reflect the will of the people. As Alaska - and America - now sees, the exact opposite is true.”\n\n\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) fumed over Twitter that “ranked-choice voting is a scam to rig elections.”\n\n\n\nPeltola will face off against Palin and Begich again in November, as the three are running in a separate race to fill the same seat for a full term starting in January 2023.",

        "description": "Residents of Jackson, Miss., are being told to shower with their mouths shut, as the city entered its fourth day on Thursday with unsafe water trickling from their faucets, CNN reported.  \n\n\n\n\"Please make sure in the shower that your mouth is not open,\" Jim Craig, senior deputy and director of health protection at the Mississippi Department of Health, told residents the day before, according to CNN. \n\n\n\nAfter flooding from the Pearl River inundated the city on Monday, an already-damaged treatment plant failed, meaning that Jackson’s taps have hardly been able to deliver any water since.  \n\n\n\nSome residents are reporting cloudy or even brown water in their faucets — when they have any water at all, CNN reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe current situation comes amid a boil-water notice that has been in effect in Mississippi’s capital for more than a month.  \n\n\n\nIt’s still unknown as to how long residents will need to continue boiling water, as such a determination cannot be made until water pressure returns to normal, CNN reported. \n\n\n\nRead more from The Hill on the crisis leaving more than 150,000 people without potable water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Equilibrium, a newsletter that tracks the growing global battle over the future of sustainability.

Gavin Newsom (D) as a reliable backup for California’s transition to clean energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA climate ‘win,’ with some caveats: “On the whole, this session was a huge win for our environment and public health,” Laura Deehan, state director for the group Environment California, said in a statement while voicing her disappointment about the nuclear plant decision.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We have no need for this potentially dangerous power source given the unstoppable momentum toward a state running on 100 percent clean, safe and renewable power — momentum that will only grow given other bills that passed,” Deehan added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat are some bills heading to Newsom’s desk? Among the bills is S.B. 1020, which would require 90 percent of the state’s electricity to come from clean energy sources by 2035 and 95 percent by 2040 — interim targets toward a 100 percent goal for 2045.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA second key item to get a go-ahead was S.B. 1137, which would prohibit oil drilling within 3,200 feet of places where residents live, work and learn.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other bills would allocate funds to clean transportation and energy, establish a statewide carbon capture program and create an incentives-based plan to promote the use of sustainable aviation fuel.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd the nuclear plant? Legislators gave a lifeline to the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant by passing S.B. 846&nbsp; late into the night on Wednesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf signed into law, the bill would invalidate a previously approved plan under which Pacific Gas and Electric would retire the facility’s two units by 2024 and 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, both units would be able to continue functioning until the end of 2030.&nbsp;Earlier this month, Newsom proposed extending the plant’s life, with the goal of maintaining a carbon-free, reliable power supply as the state transitions to renewable sources of energy, The Associated Press reported. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo read more about California’s array of approved climate bills and the contention surrounding the Diablo Canyon plant, please click here for the full story. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas cities face climate risks to water supply  \n\n\n\nA growing number of extreme weather incidents are forcing Texas towns and cities to confront the threat that climate change poses to their long-term water supplies.\n\n\n\nTexas water resources will be under increasing threat, as the state's booming population intersects with the more unpredictable and extreme climate the state faces.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Water utilities are the canary in the coal mine when it comes to climate change,” program manager Marisa Flores Gonzalez of Austin Water told Equilibrium, in the third installation of The Hill’s Dried Up series.&nbsp;The risk is sufficiently dire that a majority-Republican legislative panel in July voted unanimously to require state water planners to consult with the state climatologist in planning for future supplies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe goal of that rule change: To “remove the possibility that the political climate could harm [local water managers] ability to plan responsibly for the future,” state Sen.&nbsp;Nathan Johnson (D) told Equilibrium.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe urgent need helped the bipartisan panel cut through political differences, according to Johnson.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It's difficult to tell the public that we were not anticipating changes, resulting in drought, and flooding when it's happening all the time,” he said.  “We're reinforcing dams. We're building reservoirs, doing things along these lines,” he added. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOMING POPULATION, WORSENING WEATHER  \n\n\n\nTexas’s unique geography, environment and political climate put it at particular risk for extreme weather. \n\n\n\nWhile average precipitation levels across the state may not change much, that apparent consistency masks a new rise in dangerous extremes of flood and drought.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOver the next 50 years, the population of Texas is expected to nearly double to over 50 million— even as water supplies grow more unpredictable.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what that growing unpredictability means for individual municipalities isn’t clear.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It would be really nice if individual water suppliers weren't left to their own devices to begin to tackle the issue,” state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon of Texas A&amp;M said of adapting climate projections to local conditions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDallas as model: Sudden rains that hit Dallas-Fort Worth earlier this month are a model of what the state can expect, several experts and policymakers told Equilibrium.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDallas this summer saw record dry conditions week after week after week — and then “all of a sudden, a summers worth of rain in a single day,” said Katherine Hayhoe, a climate scientist who helped Austin design its climate plan.&nbsp;More than wetter or drier, Hayhoe continued, the weather is getting “weirder.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGrowing recognition: The new weather dynamics mean new problems for policymakers to solve, according to Johnson, the state senator.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe singled out the question of “how to capture the excessive amounts of rainfall that we're experiencing with increasing frequency and be able to store and use it throughout the year.”&nbsp;In a broader sense, Johnson said he thinks that “the recognition of this terrifying force of nature, that also brings us something that we can use” could \"seep deep into people's consciousness as something that we need to deal with.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo read the full story, please click here.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWant more?

The rule, which follows a 2020 executive order issued by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), would increase the proportion of emissions-free cars sold in the state annually, until that percentage reaches 100 in 2035.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCalifornia’s targets extend far beyond federal goals, and many states have expressed their intention to follow suit.&nbsp;&nbsp;While President Biden said last year that he hoped half of new vehicle sales would be electric by 2030, California’s rule would require 68 percent of sales to be electric that year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo what happens next? California needs to apply for a special waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as mandated by the 1970 Clean Air Act.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBecause the Clean Air Act includes a provision prohibiting states from implementing their own standards, California must apply for a waiver with the EPA for each new rule it wants to enact.&nbsp;&nbsp;The EPA must then approve that waiver unless the administrator determines that California’s reasons for applying are “arbitrary and capricious,” per the Clean Air Act. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThings may not be simple this time: While the Biden administration is expected to accept California’s new application, red states could sue over that decision.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo find out whether such a lawsuit could have teeth, please click here for the full story. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRising risk to forests in Western U.S.\n\n\n\nThe plants and wildlife in the forests of North America’s Mountain West are under some of the greatest threats from the effects of climate change, a new study has found.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDead end: While the amount of carbon stored by forests will increase overall throughout the century, certain vulnerable regions will sustain steep hits to their biodiversity and ability to store carbon, according to the paper published on Thursday in Science.\n\n\n\nAs rising temperatures and increasingly varied rainfall puts more strain on forests, they will ‘migrate’ to more hospital climates.&nbsp;That’s bad news for forests pressed against the equator, in the Arctic or high up in the mountains — places where trees have less opportunity for escape.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOutside the U.S., the boreal forests of the sub-Arctic and the dry tropical-latitude forest of the Amazon and Andes are at the biggest risk, the study found.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nComplex threats: A forest’s long-term prognosis is the combination of three factors: its ability to store carbon, its biodiversity and its vulnerability to disturbances like fires and disease.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese are issues that have been explored in isolation — but they have never before been combined to create a comprehensive picture of forest health, the authors found. “If forests are tapped to play an important role in climate mitigation, an enormous scientific effort is needed to better shed light on when and where forests will be resilient to climate change in the 21st century,” the authors wrote. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThursday Threats\n\n\n\nWorld edition: Europe’s drought dries out its economy, crossfire interrupts U.N. mission to key nuclear plant and most global citizens are concerned about climate change.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEurope’s drought strains energy, food and shipping&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEurope’s major waterways are “lower than they have been in decades,” putting both agricultural and energy production at risk, experts told CNBC. Many river routes are within a foot of being unusable, and harvests of key crops like corn, soy and sunflowers are down by up to 16 percent, according to CNBC.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShelling interrupts inspection of Ukrainian nuclear plant&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA long-awaited United Nations mission to inspect the embattled Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility was interrupted by shelling around the Russian-occupied plant on Thursday, Reuters reported. Both Russia and Ukraine blamed each other for the shelling, with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky’s chief of staff accusing Russia of trying to sabotage the mission to Europe’s largest nuclear plant, according to Reuters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nClimate change remains top global threat in Pew survey&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDespite the many ongoing threats wreaking havoc on the globe, climate change stood out as a top concern among citizens in advanced economies, according to a new poll from the Pew Research Center. A median of 75 percent across 19 nations described climate change as a major threat, according tothe survey. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease visit The Hill’s Sustainability section online for the web version of this newsletter and more stories.

        "description": "Earlier this month, the Biden administration took the official step of declaring the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency (PHE), which should free up federal funds and resources to fight the spread of the virus. This important move came not a moment too soon, as our country is in the throes of another unforeseen disease outbreak. Yet, even with this recent declaration, funding to properly address the current public health challenges and to beef up our preparedness for those to come remains insufficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is already monitoring over 14,000 cases of monkeypox in the United States alone — the highest case count of any country — and that number is increasing daily. Demand for vaccines and therapeutics is also increasing. The Biden administration sent a late-July memo to congressional Democrats asking for nearly $7 billion to combat the spread of monkeypox. The funds would be used to boost the availability of monkeypox treatments, tests and vaccines. The Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) is again suffering from inadequate appropriations to achieve and maintain preparedness goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf all this sounds familiar, it’s because we have seen this movie before with COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the spring of 2020, as COVID-19 spread across the nation, Congress and the White House were left scrambling to respond. Health care supply chains were unprepared for this scale of respiratory illness. Facilities were not holding stock of respiratory protective devices beyond regular use needs and manufacturers and distributors of these products did not have adequate stock on hand to fill needs. These supply chain failures resulted in states looking to the federal government, in particular the SNS, for support.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe unfortunate reality we faced was that due to chronic underfunding by Congress, the SNS had limited supply of these materials to shore up the failing health care supply chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSupplemental funds were appropriated, which allowed for the SNS and other government agencies to take extraordinary action to buy material during the event and work to increase production, hopefully long-term, of many of the needed materials.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThanks to COVID-19, there is broader awareness of the SNS and its mission. That mission has evolved over time from being prepared for terrorist events such as large-scale bioterror attacks to response to pandemic events and also to meet other outbreak demands, like monkeypox.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo comprehensively and effectively address current and potential PHEs, there must also be additional funding for the states and other local partners of the SNS. These levels of government play a key part in any emergency response. They are responsible for conducting critical training, transporting MCMs to points of dispensing, as well as putting shots in arms. Fully funding the SNS is a necessary step in the right direction, but if state and local governments aren’t, major roadblocks in our medical emergency response will remain.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 caught us flat-footed, and there is no excuse for that to happen again, particularly when tools to address monkeypox and other possible outbreaks are already available and stockpiled in the SNS. As we again rely on the SNS, this time to address monkeypox, we must not forget its original mission — to protect all Americans in the event of a bioterror attack — which is the very reason we are better prepared to address this current PHE.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo say our resources have been stretched thin is an understatement, and likely something being noted by countries who don’t have our best interest at heart. We have watched in horror as Russian President Vladimir Putin wages war in Ukraine, and throughout this invasion, many have questioned his mental health. A 2021 State Department report noted that Russia “maintains an offensive BW (biological weapons) program and is in violation of its obligation under Articles I and II” of the Biological Weapons Convention. And we know Russia houses the smallpox virus at the Russian lab Vector, just one of two places it’s known to be housed in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLet me be clear — the threat of a smallpox attack is just as real now as it was at the origins of the SNS. The price of being unprepared for this type of PHE is too great to risk. We must use our available resources to respond to this monkeypox outbreak, but at the same time we must rebuild and increase stocks of these materials as they are used.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMaking sure our current challenges are swiftly met and that the Strategic National Stockpile is restocked and fully funded for future emergencies must be considered a top priority for Congress and the Biden administration. It’s imperative that Congress provide sufficient funding to both address current PHEs and prepare for those to come. American communities need these vaccines and antiviral treatments now, and we may very well need them at a moment’s notice in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGreg&nbsp;Burel&nbsp;is former director of the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) for the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR).&nbsp;Burel is president at Hamilton Grace LLC, a consulting firm focused on preparedness and response.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/3624606-pilots-picketing-at-13-major-airports-ahead-of-labor-day-weekend/",
        "description": "Off-duty pilots for six airlines are picketing at airports nationwide on Thursday ahead of the busy Labor Day travel weekend in support of improved working conditions and benefits.\n\n\n\nThe one-day picketing campaign is organized by the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which represents thousands of pilots at major U.S. airlines, and comes at the end of a chaotic summer travel season that has seen a soaring number of passenger complaints as travel demand resurges.\n\n\n\n“When ALPA pilots stand shoulder to shoulder in support of shared goals, people notice — our airlines notice,” the union said in a statement. \n\n\n\n“That’s why on September 1, we’re asking all ALPA pilots to join us for an ALPA-wide informational picket to show the public, our lawmakers and our airlines that all airline pilots stand together in support of the profession-wide goal of improved working conditions and benefits,” the statement continued.\n\n\n\nPilots are prevented from easily going on strike while on duty under federal regulations, and Thursday’s picketing by off-duty pilots is not expected to affect flight operations.\n\n\n\nALPA organized the picketing at 13 major airports across the country, 11 of which serve as hub airports for major airlines. Pilots for Delta Air Lines, Endeavor Air, JetBlue, Sun Country, Spirit Airlines and United Airlines are participating, the union said.\n\n\n\nThis comes as airlines have struggled to quickly rebuild their operations to meet the return in travel demand after downsizing during the pandemic. More than 2 million people now travel through the nation’s airports on an average day, the highest levels since the start of the pandemic.\n\n\n\nThe staffing shortages, combined with issues like severe summer storms and high fuel costs, have left passengers frustrated as they face cancellations and delays.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPassenger complaints soared in the first half of the year, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has proposed strengthening federal regulations to clarify when passengers are owed refunds. Buttigieg’s department released a customer service dashboard on Thursday to help passengers understand airlines’ guarantees when they delay or cancel flights.\n\n\n\n“@Delta_Pilots are on the picket line at @JFKairport to show @Delta that we're beyond ready for a new contract,” ALPA’s Delta pilot group tweeted. “It’s been 2.5 years since our contract's amendable date &amp; 3.5 years since #DeltaPilots last had a pay raise.”\n\n\n\nAs pilots participating in Thursday’s strike look for increased benefits from their airlines, other ALPA pilot groups have already seen success in negotiating significant pay raises amid airlines’ struggles and a tight labor market.\n\n\n\nPilot unions at three regional carriers wholly owned by American Airlines — Envoy Air, Piedmont Airlines and PSA Airlines — recently announced contract agreements that include significant pay increases. Regional carriers have borne the brunt of what many in the industry view as a national pilot shortage, although ALPA has denied the existence of a shortage.\n\n\n\nMany industry workers are complaining about working longer hours and experiencing more last-minute swaps, saying airlines’ recent scheduling snafus will continue without better working conditions.\n\n\n\nJetBlue pilots at Los Angeles International Airport Thursday picketed with signs reading “schedule with integrity matters” and “fatiguing schedules = unreliable operations.”\n\n\n\nSome airlines cut back on their August schedules to improve reliability, including Delta Air Lines, which on Wednesday noted the changes as it touted its preparedness for the upcoming Labor Day travel weekend. The airline says it is preparing to serve 2.9 million customers over the weekend.“We’re looking forward to welcoming our customers on board for Labor Day weekend,” said Allison Ausband, Delta’s chief customer experience officer. “We’ve taken steps this summer to ensure our people have the tools and support they need to deliver on our high standards for reliability, while offering Delta’s signature customer service with warmth and care.”",

Sure, when everything was going well, and when the game was on their terms, they were capable of scintillating football. But when the heat was applied, they’d wilt.This week, it had been all bad news and long faces in the Brisbane camp. They’d coughed up a spot in the top four. Their injuries were mounting. They were forced to throw a debutant into the finals furnace. The coach was cranky. A grandfather, he was probably asking himself why he wasn’t at home building cubby houses. He didn’t need this kind of stress in his life. His team had drawn the short straw in Richmond – for so long their tormenters. Dustin Martin was back. Tom Lynch was in menacing touch.

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/yankees-to-promote-oswald-peraza.html",
        "description": "The Yankees have made one of the more notable September call-ups around the league, announcing the promotion of top shortstop prospect Oswald Peraza from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. With active rosters expanding and Peraza already on the 40-man roster, no corresponding move is necessary.\nIt&#8217;s the first big league call for the 22-year-old, who has spent a bit more than six years climbing the minor league ladder. Originally signed by New York out of Venezuela during the 2016-17 international signing period, the 6&#8217;0&#8243; infielder spent his first couple seasons in rookie ball. He put himself firmly on the prospect radar by 2019, showing a high-contact approach in Low-A that year. The cancelation of the following minor league season cost Peraza a year of reps, but New York still felt there was a chance another team would take him in the Rule 5 draft and carry him on the MLB roster in 2021.\nThe Yankees therefore added Peraza to the 40-man roster, and he&#8217;s occupied a spot there for the past couple seasons as he&#8217;s continued to progress through the system. He mashed in a 28-game stint in High-A to start 2021, earning a quick promotion to Double-A Somerset. Peraza played most of the year there, hitting .294/.348/.466 with 12 home runs and 20 stolen bases through 79 games. That impressive age-21 season earned him a late-season cameo in Triple-A and plenty of public support on Top 100 prospect lists entering this year.\n\nPeraza placed among the game&#8217;s top farmhands in preseason rankings at Baseball America, ESPN, The Athletic and FanGraphs. ESPN&#8217;s Kiley McDaniel was the most bullish, slotting him 25th leaguewide, but evaluators broadly agreed he was a plus defensive shortstop with power potential and bat-to-ball skills. Reports raised questions about his tendency to chase pitches outside the strike zone, but consensus opinion is that he has the physical tools to be an above-average regular.\nThe right-handed hitter hasn&#8217;t done much to change those reviews in 2022. He got off to a slow start in Triple-A but has turned things on of late, and his season line now sits at a solid .258/.329/.440. He&#8217;s hit 18 homers and swiped 33 bases on 38 attempts. Peraza&#8217;s 8% walk rate and 23.2% strikeout percentage are each pedestrian, but it&#8217;s a generally productive showing for a player of his youth and defensive profile. BA slotted him second among Yankees prospects (behind only fellow shortstop Anthony Volpe) and #76 overall on its most recent Top 100 update. McDaniel now has him 36th leaguewide, agreeing that only Volpe is the more promising minor leaguer in the New York system.\nRival teams inquired about Peraza&#8217;s availability at the trade deadline, with the Reds and Marlins reportedly looking to include him in respective discussions about Luis Castillo and Pablo López. New York held onto him, though, and he&#8217;s now in position to potentially factor into their postseason run. The Yankees are coming off an awful month of August, but they&#8217;re still a lock to make the playoffs in some capacity. With a six-game lead over the Rays in the AL East, New York remains a strong favorite for a division title and a top two seed that&#8217;d earn them a first-round bye.\nWhat role Peraza will play remains to be seen, but it stands to reason he&#8217;ll be in manager Aaron Boone&#8217;s starting lineup more often than not. Isiah Kiner-Falefa and Josh Donaldson, acquired together in an offseason blockbuster with the Twins, have been the primary left side duo in the Bronx. Kiner-Falefa is hitting only .261/.310/.315 on the season, and he carries a .237/.290/.289 mark dating back to the All-Star Break. He&#8217;s gotten mixed reviews from public metrics for his glovework. Defensive Runs Saved has rated Kiner-Falefa 11 runs above average, the fifth-highest mark among shortstops. Statcast, on the other hand, has pegged him as a run below average.\nCurtailing Kiner-Falefa&#8217;s playing time seems the easiest way to get Peraza into the lineup, but the Yankees could also work him in at the hot corner while giving Donaldson a few more days off. The former MVP has a roughly average .222/.308/.382 line across 441 plate appearances. He&#8217;s still drawing unanimous praise from public metrics for his glove, but the Yankees have also given the 36-year-old a fair number of quasi-rest days as a designated hitter.\nHowever he&#8217;s deployed, Peraza will have a bit less than five weeks to make a case for a spot on the playoff roster. As a player who was on the 40-man by September 1, he&#8217;s automatically postseason-eligible (although even players in an organization but not on the 40-man are often easily added to playoff rosters via petition to the league office). Even if he doesn&#8217;t play a key role this postseason, Peraza will get his feet wet against big league arms as he looks to stake a claim to an Opening Day roster spot next year. He&#8217;ll have one minor league option year remaining after this season, so the Yankees can send Peraza back to Scranton next season if he doesn&#8217;t hit the ground running.\nPeraza will be paid at the prorated $700K MLB minimum rate for any time he&#8217;s on the big league roster, and he&#8217;ll pick up a bit of major league service time. Far too much time has passed for him to accrue a full season of service or even threaten early arbitration eligibility as a Super Two player. He won&#8217;t be arb-eligible until after 2025 at the earliest, with his quickest path to free agency coming after 2028. If he&#8217;s optioned back to the minors next year, that could push his trajectory further into the future.\nIt&#8217;s also worth noting that Peraza will not reach 60 days of MLB service this season, nor is he likely to tally 130 at-bats and exhaust his rookie eligibility. He&#8217;ll technically remain a prospect headed into 2023, a potentially meaningful distinction under the new collective bargaining agreement. Players with less than 60 days of service who appear among two preseason Top 100 lists at Baseball America, ESPN or MLB Pipeline (as Peraza seems likely to do next offseason) can net their team a bonus amateur draft choice based on their early-career finishes in awards voting, so long as their club carries them on the MLB roster for a full service year. If the Yankees break camp with Peraza and he wins a Rookie of the Year or places highly in MVP balloting during his first couple seasons, New York could pick up an extra draft choice down the line.\nJoel Sherman of the New York Post first reported Peraza&#8217;s promotion before the team announcement.\nImage courtesy of USA Today Sports.",

        "description": "Photo by Mike Carlson/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n    \n\n  MLB rosters expanded to 28 players for the season’s final month, and the Yankees will finally give Peraza his shot. August is over, and with its departure comes a new month — and new Major League Baseball roster rules. Like last year and earlier this season during the post-lockout opening months, teams will be allowed to carry 28 players. The September limit is a fairly new concept, but not terribly unsurprising, given how those old games could drag.\nIn most years of the past decade, the Yankees’ September call-ups haven’t been particularly exciting. Usually, it’s a reliever or a bench player — perhaps a pinch-running specialist or a third catcher. That’s not the case this time, as GM Brian Cashman is finally smashing the Oswald Peraza button, per Joel Sherman of the New York Post.\n\n\nSS Oswaldo Peraza is being promoted by the Yankees with rosters expanding.— Joel Sherman (@Joelsherman1) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\n(Disregard Sherman’s typo. It’s Oswald Peraza, not to be confused with his fellow recently-promoted infielder Oswaldo Cabrera.)\nThe Yankees have confirmed the news, as well as activating Marwin Gonzalez from the paternity list. That fills out their roster at 28, so speedy reserve outfielder Tim Locastro will stick around after filling in for Marwin the past few days.\nPeraza and fellow shortstop prospect Anthony Volpe (currently in Double-A but perhaps soon ticketed for Triple-A Scranton) entered 2022 as Top 100 Prospects, and ever since he got hot in June, he’s been putting the pressure on the Yankees to give him a shot. This urgency has only grown with Isiah Kiner-Falefa’s continues woes at the plate and the Yankees’ lineup coming off a miserable August that led to the team’s worst record in a month since 1991.\nGive credit to Peraza, as he did not let his April-to-May slump affect him, and his hot bat kept the pressure on Cashman and company in the front office. On the season, the 22-year-old shortstop entered play on Thursday hitting .258/.329/.440 with 18 homers, 33 steals, and a 104 wRC+ in 98 games, but those numbers are even better since the start of June. From that point onward, he’s batting .289/.364/.498 with 13 homers, 22 steals, and a 128 wRC+ in 60 games.\nAs if to emphasize how much he needed to be in the majors, Peraza homered today as the Yankees rested on their offday.\n\n\nNew Month. Same Peraza.Oswald Peraza's 100th hit of the season was a BOMB! #RepBX #OffTheRails #SCtop10 pic.twitter.com/1gQzdnfjSN— SWB RailRiders (@swbrailriders) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nApparently, hit No. 100 and homer No. 19 were all that the Yankees needed to see. Expect Peraza to make his MLB debut tomorrow night at Tropicana Field as New York begins a now-crucial weekend set with the Rays, who have whittled the Yankees’ once-mighty AL East lead down to six games. Peraza should take over for Kiner-Falefa at shortstop, but if the Yankees are still committed to the veteran’s defense — which their own metrics value, for whatever reason — then Peraza may also cover second base (though he has limited experience).\nShould fans expect Peraza to be Derek Jeter incarnate and the bat that will propel the Yankees to a September surge? No because that’s hardly fair. But the man is a top infield prospect for a reason and has been hitting incredibly well down in Triple-A. Baseball America also called Peraza the best defensive infielder in the system, and he was tagged with the best infield arm, too.\n\n\nOh wow! Oswald Peraza is smooth as silk with this double play. pic.twitter.com/0byhoIHpaE— SWB RailRiders (@swbrailriders) July 4, 2022\n\n\n\nWith each of IKF, Gleyber Torres, and Josh Donaldson all looking lost at the plate and Anthony Rizzo missing time with injury, it was long past time to see what Peraza could do to snap the skid — even if it’s just providing a spark. He can help; let’s just hope that the Yankees follow up on their earlier statements that they would not call Peraza up just to sit on the bench.\nWelcome to the big leagues, Oswald! We’re looking forward to seeing what you can do.",

Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano is suing the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, seeking to block the panel from enforcing its subpoena for his testimony.\n\n\n\nThe suit makes a familiar argument that has largely been rejected by courts, asserting the committee has no authority to compel testimony given its construction with Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) serving as its vice chairwoman rather than a leadership-appointed ranking member.\n\n\n\n“Because the Select Committee has absolutely no authority to conduct compelled depositions, plaintiff was willing to sit for a voluntary interview,” Mastriano’s attorney Timothy Parlatore wrote in the filing.\n\n\n\n“However, because plaintiff is currently the Republican nominee for governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, he asked the committee to agree to certain prophylactic measures that would ensure that his participation would not run the risk of improperly influencing the Pennsylvania state election. Unfortunately, the committee refused to negotiate any terms of a voluntary interview that would prevent them from improperly influencing the election, thus necessitating this litigation.”\n\n\n\nTrump-aligned Mastriano is challenging Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) in a quest to lead the Keystone State.\n\n\n\nThe House committee subpoenaed the Pennsylvania state lawmaker in February, citing his involvement in a plan to send alternate slates of electors on Jan. 6, 2021, in order to swing the 2020 election for former President Trump.\n\n\n\nIn June, Mastriano said he would sit for an interview with the committee and released documents he had shared with the panel. But it was more limited than what the committee asked for, with Parlatore saying they needed guardrails to avoid information “related to official actions that you took as an elected lawmaker.” \n\n\n\nRepresentatives for the Jan. 6 committee did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\n\n\nThe filing offers new details about Mastriano’s Aug. 9 meeting with the committee, one his team previously acknowledged lasted roughly 15 minutes.\n\n\n\nMastriano appeared to ask for “some form of protection against the committee releasing edited and misleading clips of his interview,” but the night before the deposition, the panel indicated the very claims the candidate laid out in the suit filed Thursday would not suffice for seeking to avoid a formal deposition. \n\n\n\nAccording to Mastriano’s filing, things got heated when his attorney “asked whether the Chairman had issued the subpoena or if a staffer had instead issued it using an autopen” in an attempt to challenge the validity of the subpoena.\n\n\n\n“The Committee representatives became upset and refused to answer, thus increasing suspicions that Chairman Thompson did not issue the subpoena or the letter,” the filing says.\n\n\n\nThe suit asks the judge to declare Mastriano faces no obligation to comply with the subpoena and force the committee to cover his legal fees.\n\n\n\nThough Parlatore contends his suit examines a more narrow legal question about the committee’s subpoena, others who have filed similar suits have failed to convince the courts they should not have to comply with the committee’s subpoenas.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 6:23 p.m.",

        "description": "On the modern battlefield, commanders and others share information in real time to gain a common, accurate view of what’s happening so forces can react quickly to whatever occurs.\n\n\n\nThe fight against cyber criminals should be no different.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to identifying attackers’ constantly changing tactics and the best defense strategies, information is power.\n\n\n\nBut, alas, this too often is not the case today. The public and private sectors have lacked formal mechanisms for quickly sharing threat information, hampering the extensive and seamless collaboration needed to address a cybersecurity problem that keeps worsening.\n\n\n\nGlobal cybercrime costs are growing 15 percent annually and are projected to reach $10.5 trillion by 2025,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;research firm Cybersecurity Ventures. If it were measured as a country, cybercrime would be the world’s third largest economy after the United States and China.\n\n\n\nRansomware attacks, designed to cripple organizations by locking up their computer systems until they pay cryptocurrency, are especially on the rise. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)&nbsp;reported&nbsp;that 14 of the nation’s&nbsp;16 critical infrastructure sectors&nbsp;experienced ransomware attacks last year.\n\n\n\nAs everything has gone digital, companies and government agencies must face a disturbing reality: All it takes is one person in an organization to have a bad day — whether it’s Bob in the finance department who is fooled by a phishing email into clicking on malware or Betsy in IT who fat fingers a command while configuring a network device — to expose their enterprises to hackers. In cyber defense, you are always subject to the weakest link in your chain.\n\n\n\nIt is tempting to believe that technology alone can solve the entire cybersecurity issue, but while solutions for protection and post-attack recovery are potent and invaluable, they’re only one part of the puzzle.\n\n\n\nA greater flow of threat intelligence and breach reporting through formal processes also is needed to win a war in which malicious actors are constantly coming up with new tricks. We need cybersecurity leaders and peers in both the public and private sectors to keep up with the bad guys by constantly collaborating, coordinating, and liaising with each other.\n\n\n\nAfter all, businesses and government are deeply interconnected in trying to meet the cybersecurity challenge. For proof of that, one needs to look no further than the&nbsp;SolarWinds hack, in which attackers believed to be directed by the Russian intelligence service acquired sensitive government information by targeting companies with government contracts.\n\n\n\nUnless corporate and government security experts become more intentional and systematic in learning from one another in real or near-real time about the latest threats, critical information will too often remain siloed. The world can no longer afford that. Cyber defense has to be a team effort.\n\n\n\nFortunately, there are signs of progress. In mid-March, President Biden signed the&nbsp;Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act, which requires businesses considered “critical infrastructure” to report cybersecurity incidents to a federal agency within 72 hours and any ransomware payment within 24 hours.\n\n\n\nWhile implementation specifics are still being worked out by CISA, the law will add to the nation’s collective knowledge about cyberattacks by creating a record, for all to see, of&nbsp;vulnerabilities exploited, defenses that were in place, types of information compromised, and, if known, any information about the attackers.\n\n\n\nIn addition, President Biden’s&nbsp;Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity, issued in May 2021, includes actions designed to remove barriers to threat information sharing between the public and private sectors.\n\n\n\nThe order directed&nbsp;CISA to work with the Office of Management and Budget to recommend contract language that makes sharing critical data easier and established a Cyber Safety Review Board, co-chaired by government and private sector leads, to convene after a major cyber incident, analyze what happened, and make recommendations for improving security.\n\n\n\nThese measures are a helpful start, but anybody who has moved from the public to the private sector — as I did in May when I left my position as acting chief information security officer (CISO) at the CIA for a similar role at cybersecurity company Rubrik — is well aware of the need for a more substantive threat-intelligence-sharing partnership.\n\n\n\nBut how? Here are a few ideas:\n\n\n\n1 - CISOs often talk informally with each other about what’s happening, but their insights stay within the group. That wastes an opportunity to inform others and leads to isolation of time-sensitive knowledge. There needs to be a way to promulgate threat intelligence and best practices to a wider audience.\n\n\n\nFor example, my company in June named Chris Krebs, the first director of CISA, to create and lead a strategic CISO advisory board to help private and public sector organizations tackle the growth of ransomware and other cyberattacks. It’s an example of how valuable it can be for companies from across the cybersecurity industry, along with key government stakeholders, to jointly act as information clearinghouses and go-to authorities on the latest threats and ways to mitigate them.\n\n\n\n2 - A company could sponsor a network of cybersecurity leaders and authorities, similar to Gartner’s Peer Connect, which describes itself as “the world’s most influential network of business leaders” and “a community of your peers to discuss key issues and to inform your critical business decisions.”\n\n\n\n3 - Anyone can visit the State Department website and learn about threats in any country, from armed combat to crime to disease, before deciding whether to travel there. The Department of Homeland Security maintains the National Terrorist Advisory System, which provides timely, detailed information about terrorist threats. Perhaps CISA can do something similar on the cybersecurity front.\n\n\n\nThe nation’s cybersecurity posture would benefit greatly from such open&nbsp;lanes of communication. We need those on the front lines to be constantly learning from each other. With a more collaborative approach, cyber criminals will be facing a defense that’s greater than the sum of its parts.\n\n\n\nMichael Mestrovich is chief information security officer at&nbsp;zero trust data security company&nbsp;Rubrik&nbsp;and former acting CISO at the Central Intelligence Agency.",

        "description": "Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  As September 1 arrives, the Brewers add two players as the roster size increases to 28 September 1 has arrived, and with that, the rosters have expanded to 28 players. All teams must add two players (this is an MLB rule, the roster spots must be filled). Prior to tonight’s game against the Diamondbacks, the Brewers filled those two roster spots by recalling outfielder Esteury Ruiz and RHP Luis Perdomo.\nEsteury Ruiz is one of the players acquired in the Josh Hader trade. Ruiz has seen 14 games in the majors, and is 6-for-27 with a double and triple in those games. In the minors, he’s been playing very well. Between three teams in Double-A and Triple-A, he’s batted .332/.450/.523 with 13 HR, 51 RBI, 70 SB, and a 83/59 K:BB ratio.\nLuis Perdomo returns to the Brewers after a few appearances earlier this season. He’s pitched in seven games (10.1 IP), recording a 1.71 ERA and 4.38 FIP. He ended up on the IL on May 28 with a right elbow effusion, and spent two months on the IL before being activated and optioned back to the minors. In the minors this season, he has a 2.67 ERA in 24 games pitched (30.1 IP).  He only has three strikeouts in 10.1 IP this season, but his strikeout rate in the minors is better at 33 K in 30.1 IP.\nStatistics courtesy of Baseball-Reference.",

Right-hander Chad Kuhl will be on the mound for the Rockies. \nRonald Acuña Jr. homered in his return to the lineup Wednesday after a three-game absence due to knee soreness. He is back at the top of the lineup Thursday and will again serve as the DH. Travis d’Arnaud will get the start behind the plate and will hit fifth while Michael Harris moves up into the sixth spot in the order. Eddie Rosario and Robbie Grossman will man the outfield corners and bat eighth and ninth respectively.  \n\n\n#NewProfilePic pic.twitter.com/cqzPDKbPuW— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nFor the Rockies, Ryan McMahon is back in the lead off spot and will play second base. Michael Toglia, who recorded his first major league hit and first major league home run in Wednesday’s game, will play right field and bat sixth. Elias Diaz will catch Kuhl and bat seventh. \n  \n        \n  \nThursday’s game is scheduled to begin at 7:20 p.m. ET and can be seen on Bally Sports Southeast.",

        "description": "The Red Sox announced they&#8217;ve selected reliever Eduard Bazardo onto the major league roster. The club also recalled catcher Connor Wong from Triple-A Worcester. That duo will take the two extra September active roster spots, while the club already had a 40-man roster vacancy for Bazardo.\nBazardo returns to the majors on his 27th birthday. The right-hander has just two big league games under his belt, both coming last season. He worked three scoreless innings while averaging 94.6 MPH on his fastball, but he struggled over a longer stretch in Triple-A last year. Boston designated him for assignment on Opening Day as part of their initial roster set-up, and he went unclaimed on waivers.\nOutrighted to Triple-A, Bazardo has spent the 2022 campaign in Worcester. He&#8217;s tossed 57 1/3 innings over 37 outings, primarily functioning in a multi-inning relief capacity. The Venezuela native has a 3.45 ERA with a solid 23.5% strikeout rate and a lower than average 7.5% walk percentage during that run. It was a strong enough showing he&#8217;ll get another shot on the major league roster, offering a long relief option for manager Alex Cora down the stretch.",

        "description": "Photo By Winslow Townson/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Let’s do it again We’re in the last month(ish, I know some October games) of the season. The Red Sox have been bad for two months. June was the start of summer and things looked good. Now summer ends and it’s been miserable after all. But not without bright spots.\nRich Hill had one of the best performances of his life last time out. He absolutely dominated the Tampa Bay Rays for seven innings. Three hits, one walk, 11 strikeouts. No runs. And against a lineup that started nine right-handed hitters. The Rays were ready to pounce and Rich Hill shut them down. The Texas Rangers aren’t bothering with a stunt lineup and feature several lefties. Can he do it again?\nGlen Otto, who was actually matched up against Rich Hill already this season on May 14, is looking to forget history rather than remember. Way back then, before the wheels feel off the season and at the start of the hot streak, the Red Sox torched Otto for 8 runs in four innings. Eight hits, eight runs, four walks, four strikeouts. It’s kind of beautiful. 8844. Could be a decent luggage code too. That wasn’t his worst outing (6 runs in two innings against the Nationals)  but it was a rough one. The righty has been struggling in the second half all the same with a 4.28 ERA/5.34 FIP in 48.1 innings. Opponents are hitting .219/.321/.361 and while David Ortiz might scoff at a .321 OBP that’s the key here. If you can draw walks off Otto, clog the bases, he doesn’t have much room for error.",

As phones become more powerful and gain larger displays, laptops continue to get lighter. Tablet manufacturers haven’t been resting on their laurels, though. Many of the more recent tablets we’ve seen are looking to bridge the gap in terms of performance and, in select cases, handle some tasks more efficiently than both phones and laptops.\nThe tablet spectrum is varied, too. Inexpensive models like the Amazon Fire HD 10 make for excellent media streaming devices, while those in Microsoft’s versatile Surface lineup can easily serve as ad-hoc laptops when paired with an optional folio-style keyboard. Then there’s the ubiquitous iPad, a slate that has...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "Outside of 3D, curved TVs are probably one of the industry’s most ill-advised gimmicks. Unless you sat at a very specific point in front of them, they resulted in a warped image, harsh reflections, and a generally unpleasant viewing experience, for close to no benefit. Seriously, they were terrible. It felt like curved TVs happened because companies could make them, rather than because they should.\nIt took me a little while to realize it, but LG’s new 42-inch OLED Flex, which it’s announced this week at IFA and hopes to bring to market this fall, effectively marks the return of curved TVs. It may have a monitor-style stand featuring some gamer-styled RGB lighting, and LG may have confused things slightly by placing the OLED Flex on top...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "Johnny Cueto wore the towel, he didn’t throw it in. | Quinn Harris/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Where are Jason and Stoney when you need them to break up the boredom? Not that this game was always boring. The White Sox second straight win, getting them to 65-66 and undefeated in September, was interesting early. But when the two bullpens combine for 16 strikeouts, falling a few short of the record for a nine-inning game, your eyes can really glaze over late, especially if, like me, your TV kept freezing on YouTube so you had to stare at a computer for 3 1⁄2 hours.\nStoney and Jason would have been especially a help, though, since the YouTube tandem of Scott Braun and Yonder Alonso was about as insightful as one of those blind men in the old story about the elephant. Alonso was nice enough to play homer guy even more than homer guys, though, even giving the White Sox a 50-50 chance of winning the AAAL Central, which is roughly 10 times the chance all the computer algorithms give them. Very kind.\nStill, interim manager Miguel Cairo had an inspirational team meeting before the game, and the team responded.\nJohnny Cueto wasn’t particularly sharp, but was good enough. After two easy innings, he gave up a run on a couple of singles, a Gavin Sheets bobble that wasn’t called an error (the Sox managed three of those, anyway — an AJ Pollock strange rainbow of a throw, a José Abreu ground ball miss and a catcher’s interference on Yasmani Grandal — so their position as the worst defense in the league was reinforced nicely), and a fielder’s choice. \nThe lead only lasted until the bottom of the third, when Leury García and Elvis Andrus managed excuse-me 70 mph singles and Andrew Vaughn found a first-pitch cutter from just-called-up Royals starter Daniel Mengden attractive.\n\n\nGoing, going, Vaughn!   pic.twitter.com/c55b58n6SV— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nMengden has a genuinely major league Rollie Fingers ’stache, but pretty much minor league stuff, which is probably why he spent last season in Korea.\nThe one run was all the scoring for the Royals, thanks in part to their general ineptitude (yeah, I know they beat the White Sox 10 times this season, I just don’t know how that could happen). They didn’t challenge a play where a García throw appeared to pull José off ofthe bag, which was followed by what would have been an RBI double. They lost a run to bad base-running in the fifth, though two liners right to Romy González, who had a nice defensive game, and Leury helped there. And when K.C. loaded the bases against Cueto and Reynaldo López in the sixth, Nicky Lopez politely decided a pitch about three inches off the ground was a good thing to swing at and grounded out meekly.\nThe White Sox stretched the lead in the bottom of the sixth against Brad Keller, who usually is a starter. It began with a Sheets walk and a single by Pollock, who had been robbed of a homer by Drew Waters in the second, with Leury next up and apparently tired of all our lack of faith in him.\n\n\nTacked on a couple more.   pic.twitter.com/qPzLLMrxn0— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nThe González single that made it 5-1 led to the really boring stretch. Nine of the next 10 batters — five Sox and four Royals — struck out, to be followed soon thereafter by by five more Ks.\nThe major break in the inaction came in the bottom of the eighth, when Grandal led off with a weakly-hit but effective opposite-field, ground-rule double, and Pollock got revenge for the earlier theft.\n\n\nA 2-run blast from AJ Pollock! pic.twitter.com/RJMVVKQoBn— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nKevin Graveman, Jake Diekman and Matt Foster chalked up two KC whifferoonies apiece, but were outdone by the 10 from the Royals’ relievers. One interesting note, that even Alonso managed to notice — Cairo brought Graveman in for the seventh instead of automatically holding him off for the eighth, because the top of the order was coming up. Creative, intelligent managing — what a novel concept.\nOne downer — Eloy Jiménez was replaced by Josh Harrison because of an apparent leg injury. How he got that while DHing and never getting on base is a mystery, as is usual for White Sox leg injuries.\nThe Sox are now through the theoretically easy part of this homestand with only a 2-4 record to show for it. The good news is that with the Twins coming to town tomorrow, they have a chance to close the gap on one of the teams they trail in the division.",

        "description": "FanGraphs\n    \n\n  South Siders skirt around shoddy defense; pile on late for first series win in nearly three weeks Johnny Cueto is back; long live Johnny Cueto! The White Sox won their second consecutive game over the Royals on Thursday afternoon on the back of 5 1⁄3 strong innings from El Jucho and homers from Andrew Vaughn and AJ Pollock. It’s their third consecutive home game with multiple home runs, after yesterday marked the first time they even did it twice in a row. The Sox are now back to one game below .500 at 65-66, and if the Orioles hang on to the early lead they’ve opened up over the Cleveland Guardians, they’ll be at four games back of first place, and three back of the streaking Twins.\nLet’s check out the numbers from this YouTube special:\n\nThe Starters\nIf we had been told that 2022 would see the most successful one-year free agent signing of the Rick Hahn era, we probably would have imagined a season different than this one, right?\nWith another solid outing this afternoon, Johnny Cueto should once again pass James McCann and Yasmani Grandal for a Hahn free agent’s best first year with the team. Cueto couldn’t quite muster the beginning of another quality start streak after having his 10-game run snapped by the Diamondbacks last Friday, but his 5 1⁄3 innings of one-run ball were enough to pick up the win on an afternoon in which the offense decided to actually help him out a bit. Cueto’s smorgasbord of pitches moving in all different directions helped him get out of trouble in the third and fifth innings, when he escaped multiple-runners-in-scoring-position jams with just the one run charged to his name, and his multitude of windups and deliveries prevented Kansas City’s young lineup from getting very comfortable.\nHere’s the book on Cueto’s 94 pitches:\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \nFor a moment, it looked like Daniel Mengden was going to be the latest right-handed pitcher of mid- to high-fours ERA caliber to shut down the White Sox offense, making it through two innings without much trouble outside of a smoked, line-drive single from Andrew Vaughn. However, the second time through the order was far less kind to the 29-year-old whose MLB experience prior to 2022 came solely with the Oakland Athletics. His pairing of a low-90s fastball with an unremarkable cutter and low-70s rainbow curveball didn’t fool anyone the second time they saw it: Mengden’s day was ended after singles from Leury García and Elvis Andrus were followed by Andrew Vaughn’s 15th longball, José Abreu’s 30th double, and Gavin Sheets’ 21st walk.\nMengden’s 54 pitches looked like this:\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \n\nPressure Play\nKansas City’s best chance at a win today came just after Cueto departed, sending Nicky Lopez to the plate with the bases loaded, two outs, and the Sox hanging on to a 3-1 lead. With the leverage index (LI) at a game-high 4.21, Lopez grounded out to first base.\n\nPressure Cooker\nRyan O’Hearn’s pinch-hit appearance late in the game with runners in scoring position left him with a game-high 2.89 pLI, narrowly trailed by the 2.79 pLI incurred by Reynaldo López’s two-thirds of an inning pitched. \n\nTop Play\nAndrew Vaughn’s moonshot to left field gave the Sox an even .200 WPA, the biggest swing in win probability we saw today.\n\n\nTop Performer\nUnsurprisingly, Vaughn’s .210 cumulative WPA was also the highest of the game.\n\nSmackdown\nHardest hit: Romy González managed to nip Vaughn by a half a tick with his 105.5 mph fly out to dead center field in the fourth inning.\n\nWeakest contact: Elvis Andrus’ 54 mph ground out to lead off the game remained the day’s weakest contact throughout. \n\nLuckiest hit: The eighth-inning double that Yasmani Grandal hooked into the right field corner came with just a .170 xBA. \n\nToughest out: Tough scene, Romy — the ball you’ll hear from again in a moment was brutally converted into an out despite a sky-high .910 xBA.\n\nLongest hit: That González fly out was simply hit to the wrong part of the park, as it paced all batted balls today at 397 feet.\n  \n        \n  \n\nMagic Number: 15\nIt has been 15 seasons since the Sox played better than two games over .500 in the month of September. In order to finish above .500, they’ll likely have to be a little bit better than the 2007 team that last managed the feat.\n\nGlossary\nHard-hit is any ball off the bat at 95 mph or moreLI measures pressure per playpLI measures total pressure faced in-gameWhiff a swing-and-missWPA win probability added measures contributions to the winxBA expected batting average",

She said she will continue to work with Committee Chair Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) to address “California’s concerns.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP requests Meta’s info on Hunter Biden  \n\n\n\nHouse Republicans on Thursday asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to hand over communications between Facebook and the FBI related to the platform’s reduced distribution of a New York Post story on&nbsp;Hunter Biden.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZuckerberg&nbsp;previously told&nbsp;podcaster&nbsp;Joe Rogan&nbsp;last week that the social media platform limited the New York Post story’s appearance on news feeds ahead of the 2020 presidential election while it was being fact checked.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe limitation, Zuckerberg said, came in response to warnings from the FBI about disinformation and potentially polarizing content.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We have seen in recent months how some in government have sought to use Big Tech to censor divergent viewpoints and silence opposing political speech,” the 35 Republican lawmakers&nbsp;wrote to Zuckerberg in a letter.&nbsp;“Facebook’s suppression of the Post article—and allegations of Biden family corruption highly relevant to the 2020 presidential election—following guidance from the FBI is highly troubling,” the House Republicans wrote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTWITTER TESTS EDIT BUTTON \n\n\n\nTwitter is testing a feature

Twitter&nbsp;shared in a post&nbsp;from its official account. “This is happening and you’ll be okay.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe feature — the company’s most requested to date — will allow users to edit a

Xbox, leading cloud platform, Azure, and leading PC operating system, Windows OS, with Activision’s popular games.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We are concerned that Microsoft could use its control over popular games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft post-merger to harm rivals, including recent and future rivals in multi-game subscription services and cloud gaming,” Sorcha O’Carroll, CMA’s senior director of mergers, said in a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe CMA said the concerns found in the first part of the review warrant an in-depth second phase investigation, which will allow an

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3624775-house-lawmakers-press-for-vote-on-stock-ban-this-month/",
        "description": "A small bipartisan group of House lawmakers is pressing to vote this month on legislation barring members of Congress from owning and trading stocks.\n\n\n\nIn a letter sent Thursday to leaders in both parties, the group, led by Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), listed a number of legislative proposals that have already been introduced this Congress to do just that. \n\n\n\nRather than have those bills compete for predominance, the sponsors have combined forces in an effort to expedite the process, crunching the various proposals down to a series of seven baseline \"principles\" many of them share. The list includes the idea that the ban would cover not only all lawmakers, but also their spouses and dependents under the age of 18.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhatever legislation the House considers, the lawmakers said, should feature those principles. And they're pressing to stage the vote later this month when Congress returns to Washington after the long summer recess — the last window on the House calendar before the midterm elections. \n\n\n\n\"In the service of our constituents and to restore trust in our public institutions, we are working together to synthesize our respective legislation into a single, bipartisan legislative framework, and as part of that work, we have established a set of shared principles that have guided our own efforts to find consensus and develop a broader legislative framework,\" the lawmakers wrote to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), and the bipartisan leaders of the House Administration Committee: Reps. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) and Rodney Davis (R-Ill.).\n\n\n\nAmong the other stipulations outlined in the letter, the lawmakers want the legislation to ban the ownership and trade not only of stocks, but also of \"securities, commodities, futures, derivatives, options, or other similar financial assets.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey called for stiffer penalties “that are sufficient to ensure Member compliance.”\n\n\n\nAnd they want the proposal to require lawmakers either to divest existing investments covered by the ban; shift their money into more neutral places like Treasury bonds or \"widely held\" mutual funds; or move those investments into \"a Qualified Blind Trust.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBlind trusts, they add, \"must be truly blind.\"\n\n\n\nJoining Krishnamoorthi and Fitzpatrick on the letter are Democratic Reps. Angie Craig (Minn.), Jared Golden (Maine), Joe Neguse (Colo.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Katie Porter (Calif.) and Abigail Spanberger (Va.).\n\n\n\nOnce wildly unpopular on Capitol Hill, the stock ban has gained enormous momentum in the current Congress following revelations that scores of lawmakers have violated existing laws designed to eliminate conflicts of interest between legislators and the investments they make. Business Insider has been keeping a close tally, finding that the violations also extend to top staffers on Capitol Hill, often without any real penalty.\n\n\n\nSupporters of the ban say that even if no laws are violated, the system can create the damaging perception that lawmakers are trading on information not available to the general public, or that they’re crafting legislation in order to boost their own portfolios. \n\n\n\nPelosi, for instance, has been forced this year to defend stock trades made by her wealthy husband, Paul Pelosi, saying she has no involvement in his financial transactions. \n\n\n\nThe Speaker and other Democratic leaders had initially resisted the stock ban, noting that there are already federal laws prohibiting insider trading. But the pressure from rank-and-file members has forced those leaders to reconsider, and Pelosi jumped on board earlier this year, directing Lofgren to draft a proposal based on “where the support is in our caucus.” \n\n\n\n\"I do come down always in favor of trusting our members,\" Pelosi said in January, announcing her newfound support for the concept.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPelosi stipulated that any stock ban covering Congress should extend also to the judicial branch, including the Supreme Court. \n\n\n\n“It has to be government-wide,” Pelosi said at the time. “The Supreme Court has no disclosure, it has no reporting of stock transactions. And yet it makes important decisions every day.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe lawmakers endorsing Thursday’s letter did not include the courts among their stipulations. But on the other principles, they appear to be digging in.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I will reserve judgment until we have the full language,” Spanberger told reporters in the Capitol before the recess. “But a bill that does not include spouses is a bill that is not a serious effort to get at this issue.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Administration Committee said Thursday that there is “no update to share” on the drafting or timing of the proposal under consideration.&nbsp;",

        "title": "Reported sexual assaults in US military up 13%",
        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/defense/3624802-reported-sexual-assaults-in-us-military-up-13/",
        "description": "The prevalence of sexual assaults in the U.S. military is only getting worse, with service members expressing limited confidence in the system to bring perpetrators to justice, according to the Pentagon’s latest annual report on the issue, released Thursday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) report on sexual assault found that reports of such assaults in the ranks rose significantly in 2021, about 13 percent over the previous year. \n\n\n\nWhat’s more,&nbsp;8.4 percent of female service members had unwanted sexual contact in 2021, the highest rate since the department began tracking figures in 2006. For men, it was at 1.5 percent, the second-highest figure since 2006.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe data is a stark reminder that despite efforts by the Pentagon to address the long-standing problem, curtailing sexual assaults in the military has so far evaded officials. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“These numbers are tragic and extremely disappointing,” Elizabeth Foster, the DOD’s director of force resiliency, told reporters ahead of the document’s release.  \n\n\n\n“On an individual level, it is devastating to conceptualize that these numbers mean that over 35,000 service members’ lives and careers were irrevocably changed by these crimes.” \n\n\n\nOverall, out of nearly 35,900 incidents that the department estimated to have occurred, there were 8,866 sexual assault reports filed from Oct. 1, 2020, to Sept. 30, 2021. That adds up to less than a quarter of suspected incidents being reported.  \n\n\n\nThe spike was largely driven by the Army,&nbsp;where reports of sexual assault increased 25.6 percent from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Navy, meanwhile, experienced a 9.2 percent increase of reported sexual assaults, while the Air Force and the Marines each had a roughly 2 percent increase.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, confidence in the military’s response to sexual assault is waning, with&nbsp;only 39 percent of female service members saying they trust those in their chain of command to&nbsp;“treat them with dignity and respect”&nbsp;after an incident, compared with 66 percent in 2018. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor male troops during the same time period, only 63 percent were confident they would be treated well after reporting an assault, down from 82 percent in 2018.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe lack of confidence is likely linked to a drop in prosecutions for sexual assault. In 2021, only 42 percent of the 1,974 cases that ended in discipline saw court-martial proceedings.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat’s a far cry from 2013, when military services started court-martial proceedings for 71 percent of 1,187 cases.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe dismal findings have some lawmakers calling for more changes at the DOD. \n\n\n\nThough language was included in the most recently passed National Defense Authorization Act to overhaul the military justice system — taking most decisions on whether to prosecute cases of rape and sexual assault away from military commanders — that’s not enough, according to&nbsp;Rep.&nbsp;Jackie Speier (D-Calif.).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSpeier, the chairwoman of the House Armed Services military personnel subpanel, called the results “disturbing” and announced that she would hold a hearing in the coming weeks “to get more answers,” according to a statement from her office.  \n\n\n\n“The watchful eye of Congress is needed to ensure that military leadership is held to account and any additional changes deemed necessary to address this national embarrassment and crisis are made,” she said in the statement. “If we fail to do so, we risk further erosion of the confidence of our troops and further undermining of DoD’s struggling recruitment and retention efforts.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor its part, Pentagon leadership is trying to be proactive in combating sexual assaults in the military services. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nEven prior to the start of his tenure, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to combat&nbsp;sexual assault and harassment in the ranks.\n\n\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing in January 2021, the retired general said he would “fight hard to stamp out” the  issue, which he has called a “scourge” within the military. \n\n\n\nIn pursuit of that goal, Austin directed an Independent Review Commission to give the DOD recommendations on how to address the problem. The commission came back with 80 recommendations, all of which the Pentagon adopted into a plan in September 2021. \n\n\n\nAnd on Thursday the Pentagon chief sent a DOD-wide memo calling on officials to “redouble efforts to address sexual assault in the military,” Foster said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe effort will include “fielding a new full time and specialized prevention workforce to get to the left of these incidents and stop these crimes before they occur,” she added. &nbsp;",

        "description": "The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol is asking former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) to voluntarily sit with its investigators, claiming he advised the Trump team in the days after the former president's loss in the 2020 election.\n\n\n\n“You have knowledge and information directly related to our investigation. Information obtained by the Select Committee suggests that you provided detailed directives about the television advertisements that perpetuated false claims about fraud in the 2020 election, that you sought ways to expand the reach of this messaging, and that you were likely in direct conversations with President Trump about these efforts,” the committee wrote in its letter to Gingrich.\n\n\n\nAccording to the panel, Gingrich was in touch with a number of Trump’s advisors, with his communications ranging from weighing in on ads that he said needed to include a “call to action” to influence voters to even reaching out to high-level White House staff like chief of staff Mark Meadows about how Trump could challenge electors from key states.\n\n\n\nThe letter details numerous emails Gingrich sent to Trump staff, including one in which he said they needed to promote a debunked conspiracy theory that election workers in Georgia had smuggled in suitcases full of ballots. In that email Gingrich advised that the ads should include a “call to action.” \n\n\n\nAccording to the panel, Gingrich was in touch with Trump advisers and provided line edits to advertisements run by the campaign following Trump’s loss.\n\n\n\n“Some of the information that we have obtained includes email messages that you exchanged with senior advisors to President Trump and others, including Jared Kushner and Jason Miller, in which you provided detailed input into television advertisements that repeated and relied upon false claims about fraud in the 2020 election,” the committee wrote.\n\n\n\n“These advertising efforts were not designed to encourage voting for a particular candidate. Instead, these efforts attempted to cast doubt on the outcome of the election after voting had already taken place. They encouraged members of the public to contact their state officials and pressure them to challenge and overturn the results of the election,” the committee added, noting that the ads ran in the days leading up to the Dec. 14 meeting of state electors.\n\n\n\nIn one email sent shortly after Georgia election officials warned the public of the violent threats made against its workers, Gingrich wrote to Kushner and Miller about the strategy.\n\n\n\n“The goal is to arouse the country’s anger through new verifiable information the American people have never seen before[.] . . . If we inform the American people in a way they find convincing and it arouses their anger[,] they will then bring pressure on legislators and governors,” Gingrich wrote.\n\n\n\n— Updated at 7:09 p.m.",

        "description": "If you ever find yourself dealing with an airline cancellation or delay, the Department of Transportation has now launched a&nbsp;dashboard&nbsp;to help you better understand the policies of major airlines.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUpdated COVID-19 booster shots got the green light from a CDC panel ahead of a fall campaign of shots.\n\n\n\nWelcome to Overnight Health Care, where we’re following the latest moves on policy and news affecting your health. For The Hill, we’re Peter Sullivan and Joseph Choi. Subscribe here.\n\n\n\nCDC panel votes 13-1 for updated boosters\n\n\n\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) committee on Thursday recommended updated COVID-19 vaccine boosters, helping clear the way for a fall campaign for the shots.\n\n\n\nThe vote passed 13-1, with one member, Pablo Sanchez of Ohio State University, voting no over a concern about lacking enough human data on the updated shots.Once CDC Director Rochelle Walensky gives the final sign off, which is expected soon, the shots can begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe updated shots were designed to specifically target the subvariants of omicron that are currently circulating, known as BA.4 and BA.5, as well as the original virus. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy updating for&nbsp;the latest evolutions in the virus, the shots are intended to be more effective than the current vaccines, though the current ones still provide important protection against severe illness. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs long as people have received the first two shots, it has been at least two months since their last dose, and they are aged 12 or older, they are eligible for the new updated booster dose. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nTimeline for launch: The Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday that the campaign of administering the new shots, from both Pfizer and Moderna, is expected to begin “in earnest to eligible people shortly after Labor Day.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a bid to keep up with changes in the virus, the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday authorized the updated vaccines without waiting for the full clinical trials to be completed, which did provoke some discussion at the CDC meeting. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the FDA and some CDC panel members noted there is a strong safety record from the millions of doses of the original vaccine that have already been given, as well as data from a slightly different tweaked vaccine, and preliminary data for this one.\n\n\n\nThe FDA noted that the updates to this vaccine are similar to the process that happens every year for updating the flu vaccine to the latest strains.\n\n\n\nRead more here.\n\n\n\nFauci warns of ‘pretty bad flu season’\n\n\n\nOutgoing chief White House medical adviser Anthony Fauci said the U.S. should prepare for a “pretty bad flu season” later this year.\n\n\n\nSpeaking with&nbsp;Bloomberg Law, Fauci noted that a more severe flu season has already been observed in the Southern Hemisphere, which encounters new annual flu strains sooner than the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n\n\n“We should be prepared for that superimposed upon what I hope is the residual and not another spike of Covid,” Fauci told Bloomberg.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDespite reports of a more severe flu season from the Southern Hemisphere, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated in its guidance that the recommendations for flu vaccinations this year are similar to last year’s.The majority of people who only need one flu shot should plan to get immunized in September or October, according to the CDC.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwo viruses:&nbsp;Fauci said he hoped the updated shot could help impede the concurrent viral spread of both the coronavirus and influenza.\n\n\n\nFauci added that he hoped the U.S. will continue to improve on the existing vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“One of the mistakes we’ve made is that we concentrate on the problem that’s right in front of you, and put off focusing on what might be a problem in the future,” said Fauci.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\nUNPAID WORK TAKES A TOLL ON EMPLOYED WOMEN’S MENTAL HEALTH\n\n\n\nEmployed women around the world disproportionately spend hours on unpaid labor compared to men — and the underrecognized work takes a toll on their mental health.\n\n\n\nThat’s according to a new review published this month in&nbsp;The Lancet Public Health. The report comes as unpaid labor like caregiving and house work has&nbsp;increasingly fallen&nbsp;on women during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnalyzing more than a dozen studies of thousands of participants from around the world, researchers found that women reported poorer mental health when unpaid labor demands increased.At the same time, researchers found just three studies of men that detailed any negative association.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe review also “confirms persistent inequities in the division of unpaid work,” authors wrote, adding findings suggest these inequities “expose women to greater risk of poorer mental health than men.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlthough there is no universally recognized definition of unpaid labor, it is typically inclusive of “of all responsibilities and tasks done to maintain a household and its family members without any explicit monetary compensation,” authors explained.\n\n\n\nThese could include cooking, cleaning and caring for children and the elderly.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\nULTRA-PROCESSED FOOD TIED TO MORE COLORECTAL CANCER IN MEN\n\n\n\nU.S. men who consume higher rates of ultra-processed food are at a 29 percent greater risk of developing colorectal cancer, according to new study results published in&nbsp;The BMJ.&nbsp;However, no association was seen among women in the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nColorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed cancer in the country and the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFurthermore “ultra-processed foods (that is, industrial ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat formulations made of little or no whole foods) now contribute 57 percent of total daily calories consumed by American adults, which has been continuously increasing in the past two decades,” authors wrote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;recent years, the consumption of ultra-processed foods has been linked with a host of poor health outcomes including coronary heart diseases, obesity, hypertension and metabolic syndrome, to name a few.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Processed meats, most of which fall into the category of ultra-processed foods, are a strong risk factor for colorectal cancer,” explained lead study author Lu Wang of Tufts University&nbsp;in a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\nWatchdog calls for more cyber oversight of organ network\n\n\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) should improve its cybersecurity oversight of an important organ sharing network service and the nonprofit overseeing it, the inspector general’s office overseeing the federal agency said this week.\n\n\n\nThe report serves as a warning that data involving organ donors and receivers may not be adequately protected in the event of a security breach.“Because of the critical role of the OPTN and the sensitive data it contains, a security breach could have significant consequences for vulnerable patients,” the report reads, referring to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe inspector general’s office said in the&nbsp;new report&nbsp;that the department’s Health Resources and Services Administration should develop additional oversight controls for the OPTN, which administers organ transplants and testing in the U.S.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCongressional scrutiny:&nbsp;Earlier this month, the Senate Finance Committee released a report&nbsp;linking 70 deaths&nbsp;and more than 200 organ diseases to a lack of oversight from the OPTN.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe committee report detailed mistakes made with the organ network, including patients who received organs with the wrong blood type or organs that were tossed because of transportation failures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nA third Covid autumn is upon us.

        "description": "The Biden administration is expected to release applications for broad-based student loan forgiveness in the coming weeks — but that doesn’t mean there aren’t steps borrowers can take now for preparation. We’ll also look at the recent housing forecast out of Goldman Sachs, the pressure building around Amazon’s worker safety “crisis,” and more. \n\n\n\nBut first, see why some off-duty pilots are picketing at airports nationwide ahead of the busy Labor Day travel weekend.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWelcome to On The Money, your nightly guide to everything affecting your bills, bank account and bottom line. For The Hill, we’re Sylvan Lane and Aris Folley. Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat borrowers can do waiting for loan forgiveness \n\n\n\nIn a matter of weeks, the Biden administration is set to unveil applications for student borrowers to register for up to $20,000 in loan forgiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nApplications are expected to drop by early October, and borrowers will have a short window to apply if they want to see relief take effect before the end of the year. Here are a few key steps student borrowers can take now to prepare for the application process:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLog into your student aid account: One of the first things experts have urged borrowers to do in the coming weeks is log into their account at StudentAid.gov. There, borrowers will be able to view a breakdown of their federal loan and grant information as well as track and manage their federal loans.&nbsp;Find out which loans you have: President Biden’s forgiveness plan likely won’t relieve private loan debt, experts say, though there are questions about whether borrowers with certain loans issued by private lenders will be able to see relief. In particular, experts are awaiting more information on how the department will handle Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans.&nbsp;Check your income eligibility: Eligibility for the relief extends to borrowers with incomes of less than $125,000 for individuals and $250,000 for married couples and heads of households. Experts say the amount will be based on income earned in 2020 and 2021, so borrowers may need to have that information available.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCheck out the other steps here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\n\n\nGoldman Sachs releases forecast on housing downturn: ‘Further to fall’&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGoldman Sachs says home sales have taken a larger dip than previously reported, a trend experts say could continue further into the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResearchers said in the new report that new and existing home sales saw a nearly30 percent drop from the peak seen in October 2020 amid higher mortgage rates and a reversal in what was described as several “pandemic-related preference shifts.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring the pandemic, the nation saw a boom in household formation and demand for second homes, researchers noted. But they added that multiple areas that once saw “outsized increases in home sales and building permits in 2020 and 2021” are currently seeing disproportionate declines.&nbsp;Researchers say home sales could fall even further in the months ahead due to multiple factors, including what they listed as a “sustained reduction in affordability, waning pandemic tailwind, and recent decline in purchasing intentions.”&nbsp;A model included in the report forecasts a potentially sharp slowdown for home price growth in the coming quarters and for “home prices to be flat” next year, as what researchers described as a current imbalance between supply and demand levels out more.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAris has more on this here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWORKER SAFETY\n\n\n\nGroups call for Amazon CEO to testify on warehouse worker safety ‘crisis’&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore than 30 worker and civil society groups are demanding Amazon CEO Andy Jassy testify in a congressional hearing on the company’s worker safety “crisis.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a letter sent to Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and top lawmakers on two congressional labor committees on Thursday, the coalition urged the lawmakers to hold a congressional hearing on “the dangerous labor practices” the groups said have caused a number of deaths and injuries at Amazon warehouse facilities and to call Jassy and others “responsible” for those conditions to testify.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe letter noted that three Amazon workers at a New Jersey warehouse facility died last month within a three-week span and about 34,000 serious injuries were reported at company facilities last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;The groups also cited a report from the Strategic Organizing Center that found on-site injuries at the company’s facilities around the country increased by20 percent from 2020 to 2021 and another report from nonprofit organization Make the Road NJ that noted injuries at Amazon fulfillment centers in New Jersey increased by 54 percent in that time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Olafimihan Oshin has more info here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMING HOME\n\n\n\nBank of America announces measures to boost Black, Hispanic homeownership&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBank of America has announced a new effort aimed at bolstering homeownership opportunities in Black and Latino communities, with plans to offer zero down payment and zero closing cost mortgage options in certain neighborhoods.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bank said the new options, announced this week, will be offered in Black and Latino neighborhoods in Charlotte, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles and Miami, as well as other markets.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBank of America says its effort, dubbed the Community Affordable Loan Solution, is targeted at helping “eligible individuals and families obtain an affordable loan to purchase a home.”&nbsp;As part of the new rollout, the bank said the program will use “credit guidelines based on factors such as timely rent, utility bill, phone and auto insurance payments,” and will not require “mortgage insurance or minimum credit score.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAris has the deets here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood to Know\n\n\n\nThe social cost of carbon is significantly higher than the federal estimate, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResearchers put the financial toll associated with projected future carbon emissions at $185 per ton of carbon pollution added to the atmosphere, more than three times the federal government’s figure of $51.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere’s what else we have our eye on:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA bipartisan data privacy bill faces another roadblock, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) expressing concern Thursday that the proposal could limit state protections. House Republicans on Thursday asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to hand over communications between Facebook and the FBI related to the platform’s reduced distribution of a New York Post story on Hunter Biden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it for today.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3624737-biden-administration-sends-clear-message-on-anti-semitism/",
        "description": "Days ago, the U.S. Education Department’s civil rights office, OCR,&nbsp;resolved&nbsp;a major anti-Semitism case at Kyrene School District #28 in Arizona. Not only did OCR call out anti-Semitism in this one school district, it used this primary school case to fire a shot across the bow of higher education administrators who have not taken sufficient action to protect their own Jewish students, suggesting important nationwide implications for a civil rights agency that has faced&nbsp;congressional pressure&nbsp;for delays in processing anti-Semitism cases.\n\n\n\nThe federal investigation concludes that the Kyrene District, which comprises K-8 schools, violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by failing to respond appropriately to harassment of a Jewish student by numerous classmates over a period of several months, both in school and on social media. Other students called the girl a “dirty Jew,” “stinky Jew,” and “filthy Jew.” They said, “I hear you are good at head because Jews are so good at gasping for air” and asked her “How do you get a Jewish girl’s number?” then “lift her sleeve,” referencing the location of tattoos which were used to identify inmates in Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust. They created a pervasively hostile environment that too sadly resembles the situation students are facing around the country.\n\n\n\nThis case is a wakeup call. Under the new Resolution Agreement, the school district must, at a minimum, overhaul its policies and procedures. They should also hold the responsible administrators accountable. Other districts should take this as a signal to review their own policies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt is conspicuous and rare that OCR announces a case with a&nbsp;press release. Having headed the agency during two prior presidential administrations, I can say that such announcements are intended to send a nationwide signal.\n\n\n\nSignificantly, Assistant Secretary of Education Catharine E. Lhamon, used the release to identify a “distressing rise in reports of anti-Semitism on campuses across the country.” Lhamon is right to highlight the historic rise in anti-Semitism. Last year the Anti-Defamation League&nbsp;recorded&nbsp;the highest number of anti-Semitic incidents that it has ever seen in the United States. Internationally, other organizations&nbsp;found&nbsp;that worldwide anti-Semitism had also reached record levels.&nbsp;And the Louis D. Brandeis Center, the organization I head, found that 65 percent of strongly self-identified Jewish students&nbsp;surveyed&nbsp;have felt unsafe on campus and 50 percent have felt the need to hide their Jewish identity.\n\n\n\nSome who read this statement might ask: Why would the Biden administration decry rising anti-Semitism “on campuses” when announcing its resolution of a&nbsp;primary school&nbsp;case, when “campus anti-Semitism” is most often used to describe the pandemic of Jew hatred at colleges and universities? It is unusual enough for the assistant secretary to make any announcement when resolving such a case. But it seems downright strange for her to use that opportunity to address the situation in&nbsp;higher&nbsp;education.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the timing is significant. When a high-level political appointee reaches down to a primary school case to make a statement about higher education, it is because she has an important statement that she wants to make as soon as possible, and any vehicle will do.\n\n\n\nOver the last several months, OCR has quietly opened several cases involving systemic anti-Semitism in colleges, including cases brought by the Brandeis Center against&nbsp;Brooklyn College, the&nbsp;State University of New York at New Paltz, and the&nbsp;University of Southern California. The issue was brought to a nationwide audience on Sunday night when CNN&nbsp;broadcasted a primetime special featuring an interview with my colleague, Alyza Lewin, and one of our college student clients.\n\n\n\nLhamon’s message is important, and not only to reassure the Jewish community that she gets the problem. It is especially important for its true audience, which is the higher education community. This administration had not publicly signaled its commitment to the rising campus problem, although President Biden and his team have been&nbsp;outspoken&nbsp;about anti-Semitism in other contexts. Through her new statement, Lhamon is effectively telling university leaders that they had better not ignore anti-Semitism on their campuses, because OCR will hold them accountable.\n\n\n\nWhile Lhamon’s message is laudable, it must be followed by action. The Biden White House has announced that the Education Department will begin formal&nbsp;rulemaking&nbsp;later this year based on the prior administration’s executive order on anti-Semitism. It is critical that the Biden administration use this opportunity to enhance federal protections against campus anti-Semitism, just as each of the last three administration, in its own way, moved the ball forward. At a minimum, this should include reinforcing OCR’s use of the internationally agreed-upon IHRA Working&nbsp;Definition&nbsp;of Anti-Semitism, within the constitutional constraints that the prior administration adopted.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Lhamon’s announcement must be heard by university leaders. OCR has sent them a message: they must respond promptly and effectively to campus anti-Semitism. It is a message that they must diligently heed or face federal consequences.\n\n\n\nMarcus is founder and chairman of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law and author of The Definition of Anti-Semitism. He served as the 11th Assistant U.S. Secretary of Education for Civil Rights.&nbsp;",

        "description": "On discovering that Liz Truss is to be Prime Minister\n\n(Courtesy of EdvardMunch.org)\n\nQuote of the Day\n\n&#8220;One evening, I was walking along a path, the city was on one side and the fjord below. I felt tired and ill. I stopped and looked out over the fjord &#8212; the sun was setting, and the clouds turning blood red. I sensed a scream passing through nature; it seemed to me that I heard the scream. I painted this picture, painted the clouds as actual blood. The colour shrieked. This became The Scream.&#8221;\n\n\nEdvard Munch, in his Diary. \n\n\nMusical alternative to the morning’s radio news\nLiam Clancy | Aghadoe | with the Irish Philharmonic Orchestra\nLink\nSeptember 2 would have been Clancy&#8217;s 87th birthday, had he lived. Thanks to Pam Appleby (Whom God Preserve) for suggesting the song, a ballad about the ill-fated Irish Rebellion of 1798, narrated by a bereaved lover.\n\nLong Read of the Day\n If You’re Suffering After Being Sick With Covid, It’s Not Just in Your Head\nOne of the things that really annoys me is the comprehensive failure to acknowledge the seriousness and prevalence of ‘long’ Covid. This typically thorough exploration by Zeynep Tufecki is the exception that proves that rule. She thinks that “it&#8217;s the tip of a long-term scandal in how we approach complex chronic conditions and post-viral syndromes” and she’s right.\nAnd the strange thing is that we should have known this was coming. Think back to ‘Spanish flu’.\n\nWhen the influenza pandemic of 1918-19 ended, misery continued.\nMany who survived became enervated and depressed. They developed tremors and nervous complications. Similar waves of illness had followed the 1889 pandemic, with one report noting thousands “in debt and unable to work” and another describing people left “pale, listless and full of fears.”\nThe scientists Oliver Sacks and Joel Vilensky warned in 2005 that a future pandemic could bring waves of illness in its aftermath, noting “a recurring association, since the time of Hippocrates, between influenza epidemics and encephalitis-like diseases” in their wakes.\nThen came the Covid-19 pandemic, the worst viral outbreak in a century, and when sufferers complained of serious symptoms that came after they had recovered from their initial illness, they were often told it was all in their heads or unrelated to their earlier infections.\n\nAs Peter Medawar said in his 1960 Nobel lecture “a virus is a piece of bad news wrapped up in protein”.\nIt sure is.\n\nMy commonplace booklet\n”If this is your first visit to the USSR, you are welcome to it”\n\nHotel notice in Moscow pre-1989. I thought of it when the news broke that Mikhail Gorbachev had passed away. He might have appreciated it.\n\n\nThis Blog is also available as a daily email.

        "description": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.“Trump can’t hide from the Mar-a-Lago photo,” my colleague David A. Graham wrote yesterday. I called David today to talk about what makes the DOJ’s latest filing so powerful.But first, here are three new stories from The Atlantic.\r\n\tRepublicans have only themselves to blame for their Alaskan defeat.\r\n\tDon’t teach your kids to fear the world. \r\n\tWhy is Dr. Oz so bad at Twitter?\r\nA Dramatic Flair\r\n(Department of Justice / AP)\r\nThis week, the Department of Justice released a damning court filing in its case over Donald Trump’s handling of classified documents. Although the entire filing is a clear rebuttal to the excuses Trump and his team have made for the former president’s failure to hand over all requested classified materials, the last page is “prosecutors’ deftest maneuver thus far,” David wrote. On that page, a now-viral photo shows documents laid out on the floor of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home, many of which are emblazoned with bold red lettering that reads “Top Secret//SCI.” Below, David and I talk about the DOJ’s latest filing, that photo, and how the government is outsmarting Trump at every turn.Isabel Fattal: Why has the Mar-a-Lago photo been getting so much attention? What, if anything, did it reveal?David A. Graham: I don’t think the photo’s substance is new, but it puts everything into dramatic relief. It’s one thing to hear that Trump had top-secret or classified documents, and it’s another thing to see these folders with these big red letters saying “Top Secret//SCI” on them. Trump has hemmed and hawed about whether he had anything sensitive in his possession, but you’ve got the picture right there.Isabel: Let’s talk a little about the aesthetics of the photo and the strategy behind it. You wrote that the photo “is prosecutors’ deftest maneuver thus far”—and even a co-opting of Trump’s own methods. How so?David: Trump has such a great sense for the visual. You can see this going back to his real-estate career, the elaborate spreads you get of his penthouse at Trump Tower, the aesthetics of his campaign announcement speech in 2015 where he came down the gold escalator. All of these things are a testament to how he understands that it’s one thing to say things, but it’s another thing to look a certain way.The photograph is the last page of the DOJ filing—they tuck it in at the end, but I think they must have understood that it’s what was going to grab attention. Which is why it’s there, and it’s the only photo there. It’s not all of the exhibits they’re presenting in court; it’s just one that shows some of the documents. I think they understand that it’s one thing to put this stuff in writing, but if you can show people a picture, it really hits home in a different way.Isabel: And did the DOJ stage this photo, with all the documents laid out like they are? It’s a really effective way to present the evidence.David: You’re right that the staging is really intriguing. Trump complained that they made it look like he had had these documents scattered on the floor and insisted, No, the DOJ put them out, which seems to be true. It’s common for them to take photos like this to get the evidence and show what they found. But it also reminded me in a weird way of when sheriff’s offices or local police departments or even the DEA will do a drug raid and put out a spread of all the things they seized: the contraband, packages of drugs and guns and bullets. There’s the same kind of dramatic flair in this picture. So it’s both protocol and also a little bit of drama.If you look closely at the picture, there’s a ruler they put in these photos, so they can show what the size of things are—Isabel: Oh, right, on that not-so-subtle rug.David: Yes, exactly. I think the rug is a part of it too. If you had any doubt, the fact that there’s an over-the-top, baroque rug really demonstrates that this is at Mar-a-Lago.Isabel: Do you think the DOJ has been more successful in this case so far than government agencies have been at holding Trump accountable for alleged criminal behavior in the past?David: I think so far that’s true. This is still a relatively early stage in the investigation; we had a subpoena, and the search warrant, but there are no charges filed. We’ve gotten some investigations to this point before, but this one does seem to be proceeding really quickly and cleanly. As I wrote yesterday, it seems like every time Trump comes up with some sort of response, the DOJ is one step ahead of him.I also think it’s a bit simpler of a scandal to understand, and a bit easier for prosecutors to move forward than on some of these more elaborate cases. Think about some classic Trump scandals: Russiagate is all over the place. There’s all this miasma of confusion about where Trump is involved. Or January 6: There’s a running debate about whether Trump himself incited the riot, or what role he had. But this one is really simple: Either you took records or you didn’t. Either they’re top secret or they’re not. And either you turned them over or you didn’t. And what we see here is: He took the documents; they’re top secret; he didn’t turn them over.Isabel: What’s the DOJ’s next challenge?David: The big question now is whether they think they have the material to charge a crime, and whether they think it’s prudent to charge a crime. We now know that there are these documents and they were taken, and the DOJ says they have reviewed them. So they may have a lot of the substance here. But they have to decide whether they want to charge Trump with a crime: whether there’s an upside to it in terms of rule of law versus the political downside, and whether they think they would be able to get a conviction.We’re not going to know that soon, because the Justice Department tries to avoid politically fraught announcements and prosecutions within some time of elections. Unless they charge him in the next week, which seems very unlikely given where things are, we probably won’t know until after the November election what their next step is. A federal judge said today that she was open to granting Trump’s request to appoint an independent arbiter to review the files, so that may also slow down anything the DOJ does.Related:\r\n\tIf it were anyone else, they’d be prosecuted.\r\n\tWhat Trump did is more dangerous than you know.\r\nToday’s News\r\n\tCalifornia lawmakers passed a group of new climate bills late last night, which included a record $54 billion in climate spending.\r\n\tToday was Ukrainian students’ first day back at school.

The suit, filed in March 2021, argued that Apple made it difficult for him to sell his app, Flicktype, on the App Store, after it seemingly lost interest in acquiring the tech.\nThe lawsuit alleged that Apple used its monopoly power as maker of the iPhone and as the company in charge of the App Store to “crush” developers competing with it through “exploitive fees and selective application of opaque and unreasonable constraints.” Eleftheriou also accused Apple of doing little to stem the tide of copycat scam apps that tricked potential users of his app, a swipe-based keyboard for the Apple Watch.

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Citi Field saw a close series for all three days. The Dodgers made a few mistakes in the series finale, helping the Mets to a frustrating 5-3 loss on Thursday evening in New York.\nIn an exceedingly tight series, the little things can get amplified, sometimes making baseball a game of inches. A ranging Gavin Lux couldn’t get to a slow ground ball to second base in enough time to get Starling Marte to open the sixth inning. Francisco Lindor cashed in the close play with an RBI double, then stole third base on a throw from catcher Will Smith that beat him, only to have Max Muncy field the ball in front of the bag, without enough room to tag Lindor.\n  \n        \n      Gregory Fisher-USA TODAY Sports\n      Sep 1, 2022; New York City, New York, USA; New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor (12) steals third base as Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy (13) makes a late tag during the sixth inning at Citi Field. Mandatory Credit: Gregory Fisher\n  \n\nSeven pitches later, Darin Ruf flied to the warning track in left, more than deep enough to bring home Lindor. Two close plays led to two runs against Chris Martin, turning a one-run Dodgers advantage into a one-run deficit.\nThe Mets tacked on in the seventh thanks to three straight two-out hits. The second of those hits was an easy pop fly by Brandon Nimmo to shallow right field. It was Lux’s ball until it wasn’t, and both he and Mookie Betts hesitated, both watching a .090 expected batting average become 1.000. That drove in one insurance run, and Starling Marte singled home Nimmo for another.\nThose runs became extra maddening in the eighth inning, when the Dodgers put two runners on against closer extraordinaire Edwin Díaz, entering in a non-save situation against the middle of the batting order. Both Max Muncy and Justin Turner had designs on a game-tying, three-run home run, but both of their fly balls fell into the glove of a waiting Nimmo on the warning track. No leaping needed, this time.\nWelcome back\nClayton Kershaw was a bit off kilter in his first major league inning in four weeks, and walked three of his first six batters. The last of those free passes, on five pitches to Mark Canha, brought home a run, just the seventh bases-loaded walk of Kershaw’s career, and the first since August 7, 2015 in Pittsburgh.\nThursday saw Kershaw walk three batters in an inning for the first time since Game 1 of the 2015 NLDS, also against the Mets. This was just Kershaw’s second start out of 16 in which he walked more than two, entering the day with a 4.5-percent walk rate, 11th-lowest among major league pitchers with at least 80 innings.\nKershaw threw 15 pitches out of the strike zone in the first and only missed two bats, but he did induce a pair of popups, including one by Jeff McNeil to escape further damage in the opening frame.\nThen came the command.\nKershaw struck out two batters in each of his next three innings, and didn’t allow a thing after the walk to Canha. Even with the 25-pitch first inning, Kershaw needed only 74 pitches to get through five innings, thanks to retiring his final 13 batters in a row. He got thirteen swinging strikes, including eight off the slider, finishing off four of his six strikeouts with his best pitch.\nA running theme\nThe Dodgers’ runs against Mets starter Chris Bassitt also come out of a bases-loaded situation, after Justin Turner doubled and Lux singled with one out in the second. Chris Taylor dropped a fly ball single into right field that scored Turner and Lux. Trayce Thompson, who walked, got such a great jump on the hit that he was closely behind Lux rounding third base.\nDino Ebel was trying to thread the needle of sending Lux home while holding Thompson, but in the confusion, Thompson was a dead duck at the plate. \n\nThe Dodgers lost on the margins in this one, and they head home having dropped back-to-back games for the first time in 37 days.\nThursday particulars\nHome runs: none\nWP — Chris Bassitt (12-7): 6 IP, 6 hits, 2 runs, 3 walks, 4 strikeouts\nLP — Chris Martin (4-1): 1 IP, 2 hits, 2 runs, 1 strikeout\nSv — Adam Ottavino (3): 1 IP, 2 strikeouts\nUp next\nThe road trip now complete, the Dodgers return home to host the Padres at Dodger Stadium.

Plus, we’ll talk about the end of an immigration pathway for those evacuated from Afghanistan during the U.S.’s withdrawal of troops.\n\n\n\nThis is Defense &amp; National Security, your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. For The Hill, I’m Jordan Williams. Subscribe here.\n\n\n\nReports of sexual assault in the military grew in 2021\n\n\n\nReports of sexual assault in the military grew 13 percent in fiscal year 2021, according to a report from the Pentagon released Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe report said the department received 8,866 reports of sexual assault during the last fiscal year, up 1,050 reports over the 7,816 it received in fiscal year 2020.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n'Tragic and extremely disappointing:'&nbsp;Elizabeth Foster, executive director of the Office of Force Resiliency in the Department of Defense, said the numbers were the highest sexual assault prevalence for women since the department began tracking in 2006, and the second-highest prevalence rate for men.\n\n\n\n“These numbers are tragic and extremely disappointing,” Foster&nbsp;told reporters. “Every incident has a ripple effect across the unit and impacts unit cohesion, ability to trust and distracts from the critical mission at hand.”\n\n\n\nThe increase in sexual assault reports were driven by increases in the Army, which saw the largest increase in reporting out of all the services.&nbsp;The service received 4,081 reports of sexual assault, a 25 percent increase over fiscal year 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd as for sexual harassment:&nbsp;The survey found that about 29 percent of active-duty women experienced an incident of sexual harassment in 2021, up from 24 percent in 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe department received 3,174 sexual harassment reports in 2021, up from 1,781 in 2020.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the report here.  \n\n\n\nUS ends one immigration path for Afghan evacuees\n\n\n\nThe U.S. government will no longer temporarily waive immigration requirements for vulnerable Afghans entering the country, instead focusing on more enduring pathways as the evacuation enters a new phase.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe government will largely cease its use of humanitarian parole to allow at-risk Afghans to enter the country after Oct. 1, requiring remaining evacuees to demonstrate family ties in the U.S., a connection with the U.S. military or that they are among the most vulnerable applicants to the U.S. refugee program.\n\n\n\nA shift to long-term strategy:&nbsp;The latest move is a sign of a new phase in the U.S. evacuation effort as the nation marks one year since the military withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nThe move will ensure that those who arrive in the U.S. come with a more stable immigration status.Those who are given humanitarian parole at ports of entry are given just two years to secure another immigration pathway — a detail that has left many of the 85,000 Afghans who arrived during the evacuation uncertain about their future.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRecognize the ‘urgency:’&nbsp;As the government shifts from Operation Allies Welcome to a new program they are calling Operation Enduring Welcome, it has pledged to speed up processing of those hopeful of getting a Special Immigrant Visa due to their service to the U.S. military — a yearslong process that requires high-level State Department approval. Refugee applications similarly take years to process.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Our hope is that the Biden administration will recognize the urgency of this moment, just as it has for displaced Ukrainians. Far too many of our allies remain in harm’s way, and far too many families remain separated by bureaucratic hurdles,” Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“As the administration largely discontinues its use of humanitarian parole, it must commit to meaningful and efficient processing under the refugee and SIV programs. While our nation’s commitment to them has no end date, our Afghan allies deserve more than backlogs and red tape.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA harsh reality:&nbsp;Thousands of Afghans remain at processing facilities overseas, however, including in both the United Arab Emirates and in Qatar.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd since March, which the government deemed the second phase of the evacuation, only roughly 5,000 Afghans made it from such centers to the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, many more remain in Afghanistan who eager to come to the U.S., but with few pathways to do so. Many are applying to the U.S. refugee program or a separate humanitarian parole program but face daunting odds.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the full story here.  \n\n\n\nLawmakers raise concerns with proposed Iran deal\n\n\n\nA group of 50 House Democrats and Republicans is calling on President Biden to share with Congress text of a potential agreement with Iran to return to the 2015 nuclear deal before any papers are signed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a letter sent Thursday and led by Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), lawmakers raise concerns that provisions reportedly included in the agreement could lead to weakening U.S. sanctions on Iran that are meant to target funding for terrorist activities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe political divide:&nbsp;While Republicans near-universally oppose the JCPOA, Democrats are deeply divided over the effectiveness of the deal, which is intended to trade sanctions relief to Iran in exchange for Tehran agreeing to give up nuclear weapons ambitions and submit to intrusive monitoring of its activities.\n\n\n\nBut Democrats who criticize the deal say it does little to stop Iran from ever achieving a nuclear weapon and does not address other malign Iranian threats, such as funding for its terrorist activities and threats to Israel.\n\n\n\nBackstory:&nbsp;The letter comes as international officials are raising the possibility of an imminent agreement between the U.S. and Iran to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday that he hopes the JCPOA will be “concluded in the next few days.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid on Wednesday, a strong signal that there’s forward movement on a potential deal. The U.S. has maintained close communication with Israel over the negotiations, with Jerusalem virulently opposing a return to the deal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe concerns:&nbsp;In the letter sent Thursday, the lawmakers, which include 34 Democrats and 16 Republicans, raise concerns over a number of reported provisions, including that non-U.S. citizens would not be exposed to sanctions for doing business with U.S.-sanctioned Iranian persons. These persons include those associated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which is designated by the U.S. as a terrorist organization.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bipartisan letter sent Thursday also raised concern about Russia’s role in the talks given the U.S.-led, international isolation campaign against Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe lawmakers say they oppose any plan that would make Russia responsible for the disposal of Iran’s enriched uranium, a key factor in depleting the Islamic Republic’s stockpile of a critical component of nuclear weapons.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nJudge withholds ruling on special master in Trump, DOJ battle Zelensky: Russia wants world to forget about war Mastriano sues Jan. 6 committee \n\n\n\nThat’s it for today!

Tate Reeves (R) said in a Monday night press conference that the water treatment facility’s main pumps had been severely damaged, and that the facility was using smaller backup pumps. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe said that some front-line workers tried to hold the system together, but that the system was expected to eventually fail. &nbsp;“That failure appears to have begun today,” Reeves said on Monday. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nJackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba (D) said in a Tuesday press conference that the issues were caused by “a lack of pressure in the system … that was complicated by the flood waters that we received.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nReeves said Monday that the situation meant that the city can’t produce enough water to fight fires or reliably flush toilets. Reeves also urged the public not to drink the water coming from their pipes, saying it was likely to be untreated. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut these issues aren’t new: In February 2021, a winter storm caused similar issues in the city, and some people were without water for weeks. The same water treatment plant’s equipment froze up at that time because of the cold weather. The city also experienced water issues in November. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nEven before that, in 2020, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) inspectors found a host of issues in the city’s water system including: a lack of clarity in the water; leaks and line breaks in the city’s water distribution system; broken and uncalibrated monitoring equipment at the O.B. Curtis plant; and inadequate staffing at both that plant and the city’s J.H. Fewell treatment plant.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe report also said that portions of the J.H. Fewell plant, which provides a smaller amount of the city’s water, are more than 100 years old and in a “general state of disrepair.”&nbsp;The EPA further found that the city did not fully implement lead and copper monitoring requirements and also did not make efforts to replace its water service lines that are made from lead . There is no safe level of lead in drinking water, and lead exposure can damage children’s brains and nervous systems. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the Tuesday press conference, Lumumba described the city’s problems as long-standing. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is a set of accumulated problems based on deferred maintenance that has not taken place over decades,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about the issue here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FEDERAL RESPONSE  \n\n\n\nBIDEN: President Biden on Wednesday spoke by phone with Jackson, Miss., Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba (D) about emergency response efforts to the water crisis in the state’s capital.   \n\n\n\nA White House aide said that Biden phoned Lumumba “to hear firsthand from the mayor about the urgent situation with access to clean and safe water.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe two discussed emergency response efforts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), “and the president expressed his determination to provide federal support to address the immediate crisis and the longer term effort to rebuild Jackson’s water infrastructure,” the aide said.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden late Tuesday signed an emergency declaration that frees up federal resources to supplement the state’s own emergency response, authorizing FEMA to mobilize equipment and resources to the area.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nFEMA: FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell will travel to Jackson on Friday to meet with people who are affected by the crisis. The agency’s efforts are focused on making sure people have immediate access to safe drinking water, a spokesperson tweeted.  \n\n\n\nEPA: EPA Administrator Michael Regan tweeted late Wednesday that he deployed staff to Jackson for an emergency assessment of the treatment plants and expedited the delivery of equipment.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden underestimates climate costs: study \n\n\n\nThe social cost of carbon is significantly higher than the federal estimate, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Nature. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nResearchers put the financial toll associated with projected future carbon emissions at $185 per ton of carbon pollution added to the atmosphere, more than three times the federal government’s figure of $51.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey arrived at the conclusion in part by using a lower discount rate, or the cost-benefit analysis of reducing emissions now versus the future impacts of inaction. Lower discount rates result in higher estimates for the price of inaction. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Our estimate, which draws on recent advances in the scientific and economic literature, shows that we are vastly underestimating the harm of each additional ton of carbon dioxide that we release into the atmosphere,” co-author Richard G. Newell, president and CEO of the think tank Resources for the Future, said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo what? “The implication is that the benefits of government policies and other actions that reduce global warming pollution are greater than has been assumed.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe current federal social cost of carbon estimate is itself the Obama-era estimate. Upon taking office in 2017, the Trump administration dismantled the working group that made the estimate and announced a dramatically smaller estimate of $1 to $7 a ton.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration has since restored the $51 estimate but has pledged to update the number. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House originally said that the updated figure would be published “no later than January 2022” but has yet to announce an update. The Hill has reached out to the White House for clarity on the timeline.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about the study here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia approves climate bills  \n\n\n\nCalifornia state lawmakers passed an array of climate bills late Wednesday as their legislative session ticked to a close and amid an ongoing heat wave that threatens to cripple the state’s electricity grid.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile advancing several climate measures, legislators also voted to extend the shelf life of a fiercely disputed nuclear plant — a move supported by Gov.&nbsp;Gavin Newsom&nbsp;(D) as a reliable backup for California’s transition to clean energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Among the legislation to receive a green light and head to Newsom’s desk for a signature is&nbsp;S.B. 1020, which would require 90 percent of the state’s electricity to come from clean energy sources by 2035 and 95 percent by 2040. Those are interim targets toward a 100 percent goal for 2045, and all electricity procured for state agencies would need to come from clean energy by 2035, according to the bill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA second key item to get a go-ahead was&nbsp;S.B. 1137, which would prohibit oil drilling within 3,200 feet of places where residents live, work and learn, if signed into law.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOther bills approved by the legislature would allocate significant funds to&nbsp;clean transportation&nbsp;and energy, establish a statewide&nbsp;carbon capture program&nbsp;and create an incentives-based plan to promote the use of&nbsp;sustainable aviation fuel.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more from The Hill’s Sharon Udasin.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEXAS DEALS WITH CLIMATE ISSUES  \n\n\n\nAs the Western U.S. suffers under its worst drought in a millennium, the government of Texas, a state that faces its own unique set of dangers from extreme weather, is at last turning to deal with the threat that climate change poses to its long-term water supply. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nTexas’s situation is sufficiently dire that in July, a majority-Republican panel on the state legislature voted unanimously to require the state water planning board to consult with the state climatologist as it advises cities in planning to meet the state’s water needs in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe rule change “removes the possibility that the political climate could harm [local water officials’] ability to plan responsibly for the future,” state Sen. Nathan Johnson (D), a major backer of the shift, told The Hill. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It kind of insulates the regional water authorities from political pressures that would harm their ability to do what they need to do,” Johnson said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut that process won’t bear fruit for years — and Texans increasingly worry that the crisis is here now. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAll or nothing weather: The most recent demonstration of the volatile climate was last month’s flash downpours that stunned Johnson’s hometown of Dallas — a record rainfall that interrupted the city’s longtime drought, running off baked earth and acres of asphalt infrastructure to flood much of the city. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThose kinds of events offer a foretaste of the future Texas can expect, climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe told The Hill. &nbsp;“You saw record dry conditions week after week after week — and then all of a sudden, a summer’s worth of rain in a single day,” Hayhoe said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor much of the state, annual levels of rainfall may not change much — but that average conceals potentially lethal extremes of drought and flood, she said. “The amount of precipitation is staying the same. But the distribution is changing. It’s getting more extreme in both directions.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about the issue here, from The Hill’s Saul Elbein. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis story is part of The Hill’s “Dried Up” series.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-lobbying/3624840-starbucks-announces-new-ceo/",
        "description": "Starbucks on Thursday announced Laxman Narasimhan as the coffee giant’s next CEO.\n\n\n\nNarasimhan has served for three years as the CEO of health product company Reckitt, which owns brands like Lysol and Mead Johnson. Reckitt announced earlier on Thursday that Narasimhan was stepping down at the end of the month to relocate to the United States.\n\n\n\nHe will join Starbucks on Oct. 1 and assume the CEO role, as well as a position on the company’s board six months later, taking over the company’s operations as it faces a wave of union campaigns at its locations across the country. \n\n\n\nStarbucks said in a statement that Narasimhan will spend time with interim CEO Howard Schultz and other executives during the transition, and Schultz will continue on the board once Narasimhan becomes the coffee giant’s top executive on April 1.\n\n\n\n“When I learned about Laxman’s desire to relocate, it became apparent that he is the right leader to take Starbucks into its next chapter,” Schultz said in a statement. “He is uniquely positioned to shape this work and lead the company forward with his partner-centered approach and demonstrated track record of building capabilities and driving growth in both mature and emerging markets.”\n\n\n\nIn announcing Narasimhan’s departure, Reckitt said he led a “successful rejuvenation” of the company’s strategy, but he wanted to relocate back to the United States for personal and family reasons. Narasimhan also previously served in various leadership roles at PepsiCo.\n\n\n\n“Starbucks commitment to uplift humanity through connection and compassion has long distinguished the company, building an unrivaled, globally admired brand that has transformed the way we connect over coffee,” Narasimhan said in a statement. “I am humbled to be joining this iconic company at such a pivotal time, as the reinvention and investments in the partner and customer experiences position us to meet the changing demands we face today and set us up for an even stronger future.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNarasimhan joins Starbucks as the company faces a wave of union campaigns that began in December, when a store in Buffalo became the first of Starbucks’s U.S. locations to unionize.\n\n\n\nMore than 200 other locations have followed suit, and Starbucks has attempted to stymie those efforts, at times leading to battles in court. In some cases, Starbucks was found to have violated federal labor laws.\n\n\n\nStarbucks Workers United, which represents the baristas that have unionized, called on Narasimhan to end what it described as “union-busting tactics” by the company.\n\n\n\n“We are hopeful that Mr. Narasimhan will end Starbucks’ scorched earth union-busting campaign and work with all Starbucks partners to make Starbucks a better company and better place to work,” Starbucks Workers United organizing member Michelle Eisen said in a statement. “This is the perfect opportunity for Starbucks to end the wrongful terminations, store closings and war against workers, and instead embrace our union and sign the Fair Election Principles.”",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3624806-qa-meet-the-woman-who-made-history-in-alaska/",
        "description": "Mary Peltola on Wednesday became the first Alaska Native in the state's history and the first Democrat in decades to be elected to fill Alaska’s lone House seat.\n\n\n\nPeltola, who is Yup’ik, won the special election to serve the remainder of the late Rep. Don Young’s (R) term in an upset. She beat out former Gov. Sarah Palin (R) and Nick Begich III (R), a co-chair of Young's reelection campaign, whose grandfather once held the seat.. \n\n\n\nPeltola's win came the first time Alaska used a new system of an open primary followed by ranked choice voting in the general election. \n\n\n\nPeltola is also running against Palin and Begich for the full two-year term to represent Alaska in the House starting next year. That election will be decided in November.\n\n\n\nThe Hill spoke with Peltola by phone less than 24 hours after her historic win to talk about her race, her response to criticism over ranked choice voting and her call with President Biden. The interview has been edited for length and clarity:\n\n\n\nThe Hill: So my first question is, you just turned 49, and you had your special election win yesterday. How does it feel right now to be the first ever Native Alaskan and the first Democrat in decades to represent Alaska in the House?\n\n\n\nPeltola: It's just a real honor and a privilege and very humbling to have been chosen to fill out the remainder of Congressman Young’s term. Congressman Young has really established a legacy of working for all Alaskans, regardless of their party affiliation or what region of the state they're from, and I intend to continue his legacy of working for all Alaskans.\n\n\n\nWhat message do you think voters are sending by electing you to Congress?\n\n\n\nYou know, ranked choice voting, this is the first time we've been able to use ranked choice voting. I'm very optimistic about it. I think that getting away from partisan primaries will help attract more moderate candidates that really reflect better the moderate Alaskan voters. I think the majority of Alaskans are very moderate and middle-of-the-road. And I think that, for me, one of the takeaways is that the person, the candidate who is most negative in this race, got the fewest votes. And the candidate who really worked hard at staying on message and not being distracted with partisan pettiness got the most votes.\n\n\n\nThere have been some Republicans including, you know, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who was also going head-to-head with you for this special election, who have criticized ranked choice voting … I'm curious what your response is to some of these criticisms we’re hearing regarding ranked choice voting?\n\n\n\nRanked choice voting is still new to a lot of people. And change is hard, and it doesn’t come easy. But I think that, in this regard, change is certainly good and worth the growing pains. I do think — I have a lot of faith in ranked choice voting. Eighty-five percent of the time, the person with the most votes is the person who ends up with the seat. You know, clearly there has been a lot of messaging in the last couple years about — kind of attacking the confidence that we have in our electoral process and our electoral system. And Alaska has a very, very solid and … great elections. We have a lot of faith in our elections. And I think it’s a disservice to, you know, shoot holes in the confidence that we have in our election.\n\n\n\nDoes your win on Tuesday change your outlook on how you think Democrats will fare in the House and Senate ahead of November?\n\n\n\nI don't like to make too many predictions. I'm a pretty superstitious person and feel like making declarative statements tends to jinx things. So I do not want to speculate on national trends. I won by a decent margin, but it certainly wasn't a landslide. I'll be taking a very careful look at where I need to focus more of my time in terms of outreach to Alaskans and connecting with voters. But I am also very — I'm going to be very focused on the November election and making sure that we stay on track for capturing that two-year seat and really building on the momentum that we've built in this special election.\n\n\n\nI heard that President Biden had called you following your win. What did President Biden say to you?\n\n\n\nWell, he offered me a lot of&nbsp;congratulations&nbsp;and good humor and just touching base and reaching out and and primarily offering&nbsp;congratulations.\n\n\n\nAre there areas that you're thinking of where you feel like you align well with the president and maybe others where you feel like you may differ, for example?\n\n\n\nSure, health care. I agree with his desire to help with student loan forgiveness. I think that's a step in the right direction. I think helping families find affordable health care and just health care in general is the right direction. I think that the president’s stand on many issues are ones that I will be in alignment with.\n\n\n\nI'm curious what some of your legislative priorities are once you get sworn in.\n\n\n\nWell, I'll only have four months. And as you know, as political insiders know, it often takes 10 years to make advances in public policy on any given issue. And I'll only have four months. So my objective is going to be getting a good lay of the land and meeting my colleagues and starting to build positive working relationships with my colleagues and looking at where I can build coalitions and consensus to help solve some of our big pressing issues. We've got tremendous challenges right now in terms of inflation, and in terms of a lot of other things. So I'm going to be most focused on meeting my colleagues and developing positive relationships.\n\n\n\nI understand that, you know, you focused a major component of your campaign on a pro-fish campaign. I'm curious if there's any environmental priorities you have in Congress that you'd like to see or you'd like to work on.\n\n\n\nSo one of the things I'm very interested in is the reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens [Fishery Conservation and Management] Act, and that is, especially in regard to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, the Bering Sea is not as productive as it should be. Just as an example, Chinook salmon, when I was growing up, for every Chinook that spawned, six would return. Now for every Chinook salmon that spawns, less than one return. And this really reflects the low ocean productivity that we're seeing and the factory trawling that's going on in the Bering Sea is not helping the situation. And I think that it's time that the federal government really implement adaptive management and precautionary management while we're trying to get a handle on what the factors are that are causing this steep decline in Chinook returns.",

        "description": "A New Jersey man pleaded guilty on Thursday to assaulting two law enforcement officers with a dangerous weapon, causing them bodily injury during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department said in a release that 33-year-old Julian Elie Khater, from Somerset, in the northern part of the state, sprayed pepper spray at officers across a bike rack that they were using to hold rioters back and secure the Capitol’s grounds. \n\n\n\nHe first sprayed a Capitol Police officer, identified as “Officer B.S.” in court documents, in the face. The officer turned his head away and retreated from a police line.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAxios identified the officer as Brian Sicknick, who had two strokes and died of natural causes the day after the insurrection. \n\n\n\nKhater then sprayed a female Capitol Police officer, identified in court documents as “Officer C.E.,” directly in the eyes from a few feet away, the Justice Department stated. The officer dropped her head and retreated, needing another officer’s help because she could not see. \n\n\n\nKhater then sprayed a Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police officer, identified as “Officer D.C.,” in the face, and he retreated from the line. \n\n\n\nCourt documents state that Khater and a co-defendant, George Pierre Tanios, traveled to D.C. together on Jan. 6, when they attended former President Trump’s rally at the Ellipse and then joined rioters on the Capitol grounds.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTanios had previously bought two cans of bear spray and two cans of pepper spray, giving a pepper spray container to Khater on Jan. 6. Both men were arrested on March 14, 2021, according to the release.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTanios pleaded guilty in July to charges of disorderly conduct and trespassing. He will be sentenced on Dec. 6 and could face up to two years in prison overall for the charges. \n\n\n\nKhater will be sentenced on Dec. 13 and faces a maximum of 20 years in prison for each count of assaulting, resisting or impeding officers with a dangerous weapon. Both men could also face financial penalties.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKhater’s guilty plea comes on the same day that a former New York City Police Department officer was sentenced to 10 years in prison for using the U.S. flagpole to assault a police officer trying to hold back the rioters. The sentence is the longest that a Jan. 6 defendant has been given so far. \n\n\n\nThe Justice Department noted in the release that more than 860 people have been arrested in almost all 50 states for crimes related to the insurrection, and more than 260 of them have been charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement.",

        "description": "Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Colorado looks to leave a mark on the NL East with a potential series win We’ve got a series victory on the line this evening! A one-run victory and one-run defeat has led up to this Game 3 rubber match between the Rockies and Braves, and with the series run total tied 3-3, both clubs have played a similar game.\nAtlanta will open the series rubber match with Spencer Strider, holder of a 2.87 ERA. One of the Braves’ workhorses down the 2022 stretch, Strider has allowed a single run in five of his last six starts. He holds the second-best strikeout percentage in baseball (36.7%), and with a WHIP narrowly above one, opposing teams have been forced to take serious advantage on any mistake pitch that Strider throws. With an average fastball at 98.2 MPH, you won’t find many starters with the velocity and workload of this Atlanta right-hander.\nWalk percentage (8.8%) is his only slider on Baseball Savant with a blue shade. With a mainly-two-pitch mix of fastballs and sliders (and a lefty-only changeup), it would seem that fastball command is the primary source of Strider’s potential mistakes. He’s got the luxury of Atlanta sea level this afternoon, but Rockies hitters have fortunately seen two games of acclimation in the Braves’ home ballpark.\nChad Kuhl takes the hill for the Rockies, one start removed from a stint on the injured list (right hip) that kept him sidelined for 22 days. He last pitched on Saturday against the Mets, allowing five runs on five hits. It was still a better showing than his previous outing before the injury (@ SD; 8 H, 9 R), but also a different tale than the 1.90 ERA that he posted in the first month of the season.\nKuhl now holds a 5.17 ERA on the year. With an offseason of rest on the horizon for injured starter prospects Ryan Rolison and Peter Lambert, and with veterans Kyle Freeland and Antonio Senzatela recently extended, a player like Kuhl could be in need of a statement September.\nFirst Pitch: 5:20 p.m. MDT\nTV: AT&amp;T Sports Net Rocky Mountain (COL), Bally Sports South (ATL); MLB.TV\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM; KNRV 1150 (Spanish)\nLineups:\n\n\nFun facts about ATL: : Coca-Cola was invented in Atlanta ️: The name is thought to be a shortened version of Atlantica-Pacifica from railroad engineer J.

        "description": "Gregory Fisher-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Mets jumped all over every Dodgers’ mistake and held on for their fourth win in seven tries against Los Angeles. The Dodgers came into this game with the best DRS in the National League, but you would have never guessed it by the sloppy nature of their play against the Mets. New York, to their credit, capitalized on seemingly ever L.A. mistake, and they emerged with a 5-3 win that helped them secure a series victory against the best team in baseball.\nAfter yesterday’s crisp, 2:19 game that featured pristine play and a classic pitcher’s duel, this game was more of a three-plus hour slog featuring bad baseball and a confusing moment featuring the Citi Field lights that halted play for a few minutes. It started with the bottom of the first, when Clayton Kershaw, fresh off four weeks on the IL, walked Starling Marte, allowed a hit to Francisco Lindor, walked Pete Alonso, and then walked Mark Canha to force in a run. It was only the seventh bases loaded walk of the future Hall of Famer’s career, and a tell tale sign that he was rusty coming off his prolonged absence. The left-hander settled down after the shaky first, retiring the final 13 batters he would face, including six strikeouts in an eight-batter span.\nThe Dodgers took the lead against Chris Bassitt, who was equally not sharp early on. They loaded the bases against the Mets’ right-hander on a Justin Turner double, a Gavin Lux single, a Trayce Thompson walk, and a Chris Taylor single to drive in two runs. However, the Dodgers got greedy, and Thompson was tossed out trying to score from first on the shallow single to right. That proved to be costly later on when the Mets got to the Dodgers’ bullpen and finally broke through.\nThat would happen in the sixth against Chris Martin (the pitcher, not the Coldplay singer). Marte led off with a single, and Lindor, who already got a hit in the first and made a terrific defensive play to end the fifth, doubled home the tying run. After Lindor stole third, the struggling Darin Ruf drove him home on a sacrifice fly to give New York the lead.\nThe Mets added two runs in the seventh against Caleb Ferguson, which turned out to be huge. More impressively, they did it with two outs. James McCann got the rally started with a rare double—to be fair to McCann, his two outs earlier in the game were line drives and could have easily been hits in different circumstances—and Brandon Nimmo drove him home on a double when Lux and Mookie Betts misjudged a shallow fly ball that should have been the third out of the inning. Marte then singled Nimmo home to give the Mets their biggest lead of the series.\nEdwin Díaz, sans Timmy Trumpet’s electric live rendition of ‘Narco’, was considerably less sharp than he was the previous night, walking the first batter he faced and hitting the next to put him in immediate turmoil. He then got two deep fly balls to the warning track to force a run home, but he dialed it up by striking out Lux with a 102.8 miles-per-hour fastball, the quickest pitch of his career. Adam Ottavino, who pitched the eighth in yesterday’s game, came in for the ninth, and tossed a 1-2-3 frame to pick up the save. With the win, the Mets improved to 15-3 in rubber matches this season.\nThe Mets will face off with the Nationals as they look to continue marching towards a division crown. They will carry at least a three-game lead into Friday’s game, and possibly a four-game lead, depending on the result of tonight’s game between the Braves and Rockies.\nBox scores\nMLBESPN\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs.com\n  \nWhat’s WPA?\nBig Mets winner: Francisco Lindor, 30.1% WPABig Mets loser: Jeff McNeil, -9.8% WPAMets pitchers: 20.0% WPAMets hitters: 30.0% WPATeh aw3s0mest play: Francisco Lindor run-scoring single in the sixth, 23.3% WPATeh sux0rest play: Chris Taylor two-run single in the second, -9.2% WPA\nSB Nation GameThreads\nAmazin’ AvenueTrue Blue LA",

Who did the D-backs add...? \n\nToday's Lineups\n\n\n\n\nBREWERS\nDIAMONDBACKS\n\n\n\n\nChristian Yelich - LF\nJosh Rojas - 3B\n\n\nWilly Adames - SS\nJake McCarthy - DH\n\n\nRowdy Tellez - DH\nKetel Marte - 2B\n\n\nHunter Renfroe - RF\nChristian Walker - 1B\n\n\nKolten Wong - 2B\nDaulton Varsho - RF\n\n\nKeston Hiura - 1B\nCorbin Carroll - LF\n\n\nJace Peterson - 3B\nCarson Kelly - C\n\n\nVictor Caratini - C\nAlek Thomas - CF\n\n\nGarrett Mitchell - CF\nGeraldo Perdomo - SS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrandon Woodruff - RHP\nMerrill Kelly - RHP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 1st used to be a big day in the calendar. Previously, it meant teams could call up any players on the 40-man, with no limitation as to the number. The resulting jumbo squads changee the way teams played in the final month, with far more relievers and bench bats available. This led to some... interesting box-scores, such as this contest against the Cardinals where we used thirteen different pitchers, and they used eleven. That kind of game will not be seen again, partly due to the Manfred Man rule, partly because teams are now restricted to adding just two players, for a total of 28 with a maximum of 14 pitchers. So, Arizona have called up one pitcher and one position player. But, wait... There’s more!\nRoster moves\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks made the following roster moves:\n\nSelected INF Wilmer Difo (No. 1) from Triple-A Reno.\nReinstated LHP Kyle Nelson (lower back spasms) from the 15-day injured list.\nReinstated RHP Keynan Middleton (strained right ankle) from the 15-day injured list.\n Designated RHP Noé Ramirez for assignment.\n\nThe D-backs’ active roster is now at 28 and 40-man remains at 40.\nDifo will become the 55th player used by Arizona this season: they are still well short of the franchise record of 64, set last season, and without the option of unfettered 40-man usage, I don’t see ten more names being called up over the final five weeks. A little surprised they went with Difo, who doesn’t appear particularly to have much future. He turned 30 in April, and has an OPS+ of just 76 over seven seasons in Washington and Pittsburgh, covering a total of 489 games. Last year, he batted .269/.329/.384 across 114 games with the Pirates, the OPS+ of 93 being Difo’s best since his rookie campaign of 2016. He also pitched twice for them, so maybe he’s a bullpen arm... :)\nThe return of Nelson is largely as expected, but the return of Middleton means it also appears to be the end of Ramirez’s time as a Diamondback. He had been one of the most common arms trotted out of the pen. Indeed, since coming over from the Angels in mid-June last year, he has made the second-most appearances by any Arizona pitcher, at 91. Only Joe Mantiply (101) has more, and third-place is a long way back of Ramirez (Caleb Smith’s 55). But the quality has not been there this year. His ERA is close to two and a half runs higher (5.22 vs. 2.76) and his peripherals have gone the wrong way too, his FIP increasing from 3.48 to 5.16. I’m not going to say I called it, but in the GDT on Tuesday night.... yeah, I called it.",

        "description": "On Aug. 9, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act. The bill  provides  $52 billion to support semiconductor manufacturing through subsidies and tax credits while providing $200 billion to support scientific research in emerging technologies like quantum computing and artificial intelligence. The bill is the final product in a long line of negotiations  designed  to beef up the United States' manufacturing and technological capacity in preparation for competition with China. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn Washington, both parties have heralded the CHIPS and Science Act as a major win. President Biden  called  it a bill to ensure \"the world's leading innovation happens in America.\" Many Senate Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), also  supported  the bill, even over the vocal opposition of many right-wing members of the conference. In an ever-divided Washington caught in bitter infighting, the CHIPS and Science Act has managed to sneak through with surprising bipartisan backing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWashington, however, should be careful of celebrating too soon. The CHIPS and Science Act is an excellent step in the right direction — but for America's investments in science and technology to end here would be a major mistake. While the $280 billion package will greatly  boost  America's domestic research and semiconductor manufacturing capacity, it alone will likely be insufficient to sustain the United States’ technological advantage through decades of competition with an increasingly powerful China.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2018, China announced the Made in China 2025 (MIC 2025) Initiative. Made in China 2025 was a state-led effort to  invest  billions into key emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and biopharmaceuticals while boosting China's domestic high-tech manufacturing until 70 percent of China's critical technology parts are sourced domestically. In essence, Made in China 2025 was Beijing's attempt to reach for global technological leadership,  bypassing  the technological edge long held by the United States and its allies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe launch of Made in China 2025 prompted immense global alarm from companies and governments worldwide, many of whom fear the consequences of China gaining a technological edge over the United States. Military analysts  fear  that a technologically-rejuvenated Chinese military might take bolder, more aggressive steps against Taiwan or in the South China Sea, increasing the risk of miscalculation. Companies  worry  that Chinese government investments in scientific research would strengthen domestic Chinese technology firms, giving them a technological and commercial advantage to outcompete American firms in China and abroad. Many policymakers also  fear  that the use of new Chinese technology products in American or allied systems might lead to potential cyberattacks or espionage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe backlash to Made in China 2025  prompted  Beijing to stop using the term, but while China abandoned the plan's semantics, Beijing never  abandoned  the plan itself. Since 2018, China has continued to prime the pump, investing billions into high-tech manufacturing,  including  an enormous $1.4 trillion announced in 2020. Beijing is also busy  increasing  its annual funding for scientific research and development, which now ranks just below the United States in terms of its gross annual funding for scientific research. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAside from financial capital, Beijing is also eager to expand its advantages in human capital and data collection. China has a population four times the United States and  graduated  far more STEM PhDs than the United States in the last several years. Beijing is also keen to  recruit  senior scientists of Chinese origin via its Thousand Talents Program, which provides funding for such researchers to leave the West and return to China. It has also used China's vast surveillance apparatus to  collect  enormous amounts of data, enabling it to make significant leaps in machine learning and computer vision research. Together, these efforts highlight China's drive to gain global technological primacy, which risks severe technological, economic, and political consequences for the West.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAgainst this challenge, the CHIPS and Science bill alone is inadequate. Through financial metrics alone, the bill's science funding pales compared to the huge investments China continues to make each year. Furthermore, the bill's focus on semiconductors, while laudable, leaves out the raw materials used to  make  semiconductors and other key critical technology components — rare-earth elements. Supply chains for rare earth elements  are  heavily dependent on China, reflecting a major national security risk as tensions between Washington and Beijing rise.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThus, for the United States and its allies to sustain their technological lead through decades of competition with China, important reforms are needed. From a financial perspective, America must increase its investments in scientific research in emerging technologies like biotechnology and artificial intelligence. Grant applications in such fields  are  already highly competitive, and such an increase could support a new wave of researchers to bolster American innovation. America’s leaders should also use subsidies and tax credits to boost domestic production of the key rare-earth minerals used in technology products. Such efforts  would  help secure American technology supply chains when tensions with Beijing make traditional supply chains from China far riskier.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmerica's leaders must also try to match China's advantages in human capital and data collection. From a human capital perspective, the United States  must  take steps to overhaul its broken immigration system, especially by  expanding  available visas for high-skilled immigration and  simplifying  regulations for international students studying in the United States to become American citizens. Many of these international students are  educated  at top universities paid for by American taxpayers and eagerly want to stay — but America's bureaucratic and ever-backlogged  immigration system threatens to drive these high-skilled immigrants and their scientific talent abroad, enriching other nations instead of the United States. America's leaders should also foster partnerships between research institutions and technology companies to expand researchers' access to data while  investing  in the development of Privacy-Preserving (PP) technologies to ensure such data collection does not compromise individuals' privacy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOf course, the CHIPS and Science Bill is still a valuable piece of legislation. But sustaining America's technological advantage is a marathon, not a sprint. The United States must make the reforms needed for it to compete for decades to come — otherwise, the CHIPS and Science Act might be remembered as little more than a band-aid for a gaping wound.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSergio Imparato is a Lecturer on Government at Harvard University, where he teaches Grand Strategy in International Relations and U.S. Foreign Policy.

Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called on President Biden to use a prime-time speech to apologize for a remark calling \"MAGA\" philosophy “semi-fascism.”\n\n\n\n“President Biden has chosen to divide, demean and disparage his fellow Americans. Why? Simply because they disagree with his policies. That is not leadership,” McCarthy said in a prebuttal speech to Biden's planned address from the president's hometown of Scranton, Pa., Thursday evening.\n\n\n\n“When the President speaks tonight at Independence Hall, the first lines out of his mouth [should] be to apologize for slandering tens of millions of Americans as fascists.\"\n\n\n\nMcCarthy’s speech came just ahead of a&nbsp;prime-time speech from Biden&nbsp;on Thursday night in Philadelphia, Pa., which the White House said he will use to warn that “MAGA forces are determined to take this country backward.”\n\n\n\nIn a fundraiser last week, Biden said that the “extreme MAGA philosophy” in the wing of the Republican party aligned with former President Trump is “like semi-fascism.”\n\n\n\nThe speech comes as midterm campaign season kicks into high gear, and the Republican minority leader is stepping into the spotlight as he eyes the Speaker's gavel.\n\n\n\nBut though McCarthy once&nbsp;predicted that&nbsp;2022 could be even more of a Republican wave than 2010, when Republicans won 63 seats in the House, the environment is different now. Democrats have seen a&nbsp;spike in Democratic voter enthusiasm&nbsp;and some Republicans have&nbsp;tempered expectations&nbsp;about the midterm elections this year.\n\n\n\nWhile midterm elections have traditionally been a referendum on the party in power in the White House, Democrats have aimed to frame this year's as a choice between their party and an extreme, pro-Trump wing.\n\n\n\nIn his speech, McCarthy aimed to reframe the election as a statement about total Democratic control of Washington.\n\n\n\n“Democrats control every committee in Congress responsible for our nation’s safety, our prosperity, our education and our government oversight. They are in charge of every federal agency responsible for law enforcement, for drug enforcement, for Homeland Security, for our border security,” he said. “Are you better off? What has two years of one-party Democrat rule in Washington given us?”\n\n\n\nAnd he tried to flip Democrats’ script about extremism.\n\n\n\nListing immigration policy changes made by the Biden administration that he said went around Congress and a planned boost to the IRS workforce, as well as saying the White House \"colluded\" with big tech, McCarthy said: “That is an assault on democracy.\"\n\n\n\nHe did not avoid the topic of Trump, whose Florida home the FBI raided last month in an operation to recover classified documents and presidential records.\n\n\n\n“Joe Biden and a politicized Department of Justice launched a raid on the home of his top political rival, Donald Trump,” McCarthy said, repeating, “That is an assault on democracy.”\n\n\n\nIn a twist on Biden’s 2020 campaign tagline on a “battle for the soul of the nation,” McCarthy asserted that Biden is the one who has damaged the nation’s “soul.”\n\n\n\n“​​In the past two years, Joe Biden has launched an assault on the soul of America, on its people, on its laws, on its most sacred values. He has launched an assault on our democracy, his policies have severely wounded America’s soul, diminished America’s spirit, and betrayed America's trust,” McCarthy said.\n\n\n\nMcCarthy hit on many familiar themes for Republicans, dinging Biden and Democrats for high gas prices, a migration surge on the U.S.-Mexico border, inflation and supply chain issues.\n\n\n\nHe also took aim at the Biden administration’s “heavy-handed COVID policies,” saying that vaccine mandates put in place by Democrats meant “firing our military heroes and our first responders,” and saying that school closures “erased 20 years of progress in reading and math proficiency.”\n\n\n\nAlso appearing with McCarthy at the event was Jim Bognet, a Republican challenging incumbent Rep. Matt Cartwright (D) in Pennsylvania’s competitive 8th Congressional District, who echoed McCarthy's outrage at Biden’s “semi-fascism” remark.\n\n\n\n“We're mad that Joe Biden came here and called us fascist. I want to remind folks, a Bernie Sanders supporter is the one who took a shot at [House Minority Whip] Steve Scalise and other Republican congressmen. And we just had a crazy person go to Virginia and try to murder – murder – [Supreme Court Justice] Brett Kavanaugh, because they didn't agree with a Supreme Court decision. That is extremist,”&nbsp; Bognet said.",

        "description": "President Joe Biden speaks outside Independence Hall on Sept. 1, in Philadelphia.Evan Vucci/APUpdated September 1, 2022 at 9:31 PM ETPresident Biden on Thursday warned Americans that democracy is under attack from a faction of the Republican party led by former President Donald Trump, and called on Democrats, mainstream Republicans and independents to &quot;speak up, speak out, get engaged — vote, vote vote.&quot;In a rare prime time speech, Biden attacked his predecessor, saying that &quot;too much of what&#x27;s happening in our country today isn&#x27;t normal.&quot; The speech came just two months ahead of midterm congressional elections, where Democrats are fighting to keep their slim majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives.Biden said the Republican party is &quot;dominated, driven, intimidated by Donald Trump&quot; and his supporters, calling it &quot;a threat to this country.&quot; &quot;They refuse to accept the results of a free election. And they&#x27;re working right now as I speak in state after state to give the power to decide elections in America to partisans and cronies, empowering election deniers to undermine democracy itself,&quot; Biden said, speaking outside Independence National Historical Park in downtown Philadelphia.The White House claimed it was not a political speech, but Biden launched multiple political broadsides against Trump and his supporters. He called them &quot;MAGA Republicans&quot; — referring to the &#x27;Make America Great Again&#x27; slogan used by the former president. &quot;Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,&quot; he said. Biden is looking to capitalize on recent momentum, strategists sayAfter months of struggling in the polls, Biden is seeking to capitalize on a series of legislative wins, concerns about the impact of the Supreme Court&#x27;s abortion ruling --- and from ongoing coverage of Trump&#x27;s legal problems, said Doug Sosnik, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton.&quot;The real power of the presidency is understanding the use of the bully pulpit,&quot; Sosnik said. &quot;The better your standing with the American public, the more likely you are to have an impact with the speech.&quot; Ben Tulchin, a Democratic pollster, praised Biden and his team for shifting their strategy and taking on Republicans more directly.He said Biden is wise to establish more contrast between himself and Trump and the Republicans. &quot;Every hero needs a villain,&quot; Tulchin said. &quot;And Donald Trump plays a very good villain.&quot;Republicans said Biden was being divisiveSpeaking ahead of the address, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy called on Biden to apologize.&quot;President Biden has chosen to divide, demean, and disparage his fellow Americans — why? Simply because they disagree with his policies,&quot; McCarthy said in his own speech from Pennsylvania. &quot;That is not leadership.&quot;Biden sought to make clear that he was not criticizing all Republicans, calling on mainstream Republicans to reject that wing of their party.\n&quot;We are not powerless in the face of these threats. We are not bystanders in this ongoing attack on democracy,&quot; he said. &quot;There are far more Americans, far more Americans from every background and belief who reject the extreme MAGA ideology than those that accept it. &quot;\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "Vials of the reformulated Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster move through production at a plant in Kalamazoo, Mich.Pfizer Inc.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky has endorsed the first updated COVID-19 booster shots.Earlier in the day vaccine advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted to recommend reformulated versions of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. The vote was 13 in favor and one no vote.&quot;The updated COVID-19 boosters are formulated to better protect against the most recently circulating COVID-19 variant,&quot; Walensky said in a written statement announcing her decision.&quot;If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your COVID-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it,&quot; Walensky said.The booster shots target both the original strain of the coronavirus and the omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants that most people are catching now. This double-barreled vaccine is called a bivalent vaccine.The CDC advisers recommended that anyone age 12 and older get the new Pfizer-BioNTech boosters as authorized by the Food and Drug Administration. The updated Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for anyone 18 and older.In both cases people would have to wait two months after completing their initial vaccination or their last booster shot. But many vaccine experts say it would be better to wait at least four months since the last shot or COVID infection, or the boosters won&#x27;t work as well.This is the first time the FDA has authorized COVID vaccines without requiring they get tested in people.  To keep up with the rapidly evolving virus, the FDA relied on how well the shots stimulated the immune systems of mice. They also looked at how well similar shots targeted at earlier variants worked on people. The companies and federal officials say there&#x27;s no question the shots are safe and they argue the evidence indicates the reformulated boosters will help reduce the chances people will catch the virus and spread it.But some people wonder if it would be better to wait for the results from human studies that are already underway.&quot;It certainly looks very promising,&quot; said CDC advisor Dr. Pablo Sanchez from The Ohio State University at Thursday&#x27;s hearing. &quot;I understand the constant shift of these variants but studies with the BA.4 and BA.5 are ongoing in humans and I just wonder if it&#x27;s a little premature,&quot; he said. Sanchez was the only adviser to vote no. &quot;I voted no because I feel we really need the human data,&quot; he explained. &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of vaccine hesitancy already. We need human data.&quot;But other advisers were more comfortable, pointing out that flu vaccines are updated every year without being tested in people.&quot;This is the future that we&#x27;re heading for,&quot; says Dr. Jamie Loehr of Cayuga Family Medicine. &quot;We&#x27;re going to have more variants and we should be treating this like the flu, where we can use new strain variants every year.&quot; Loehr says he&#x27;s comfortable recommending the updated boosters, &quot;even if we don&#x27;t have human data.&quot;Between 400 and 500 people are still dying every day in the U.S. from COVID-19 and public health officials are worried another surge could hit this fall or winter. The administration hopes the reformulated boosters will help contain a surge and protect people from serious disease or death.The federal government plans to make the boosters available quickly. In advance of the FDA&#x27;s decision, Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator told NPR that the new boosters represented &quot;a really important moment in this pandemic.&quot;Now the CDC has signed off, few shots could be available as early as Friday, with a wider rollout next week.

A grand jury in Washington, D.C., handed up an indictment charging her with four counts, including conspiracy, obstruction of an official proceeding and obstruction of justice. She is expected to make her initial appearance in federal court in Austin, Texas.SoRelle is a lawyer and close associate of Stewart Rhodes, the founder and leader of the Oath Keepers. Rhodes and other members of the group are slated to go on trial at the end of September on seditious conspiracy and other charges for their alleged actions in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. The government says they sought to use force to stop Congress&#x27; certification of Joe Biden&#x27;s election win.SoRelle took up Rhodes&#x27; position as head of the group after he was charged, according to some reports.At the hearings from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot, panel members brought forth evidence that Trump allies coordinated with members of far-right groups like the Oath Keepers.&quot;The best illustration for what the Oath Keepers are happened Jan. 6. We saw that stacked military formation going up the stairs of our Capitol,&quot; Jason Van Tatenhove, a former spokesman for the Oath Keepers, said at one of the hearings in July.He described the Oath Keepers as a &quot;violent militia&quot; that has drifted further to the right.He added the violence from Jan. 6 makes him concerned for the next election: &quot;I do fear for this next election cycle because who knows what that might bring.&quot; Copyright 2022 NPR.

Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology,” he said. “But there’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.”\n\n\n\nThe president portrayed Republicans aligned with Trump as a threat to the right to have an abortion, contraception and privacy, and accused the GOP of seeking to take the country “backward.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I believe America is at an inflection point, one of those moments that determine the shape of everything that’s to come after,” Biden said, urging Americans to fight for democracy “in 2022 and beyond.”\n\n\n\nWhile White House officials insisted Thursday night’s speech would not be political in nature, Biden levied multiple criticisms of Trump and Republicans while rounding out the address by touting his policy wins on issues like police funding and the pandemic, and contrasted his vision for the nation with the GOP. He also called on Americans to “vote, vote, vote.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThursday’s speech served as an encapsulation of Biden’s midterm message as he increasingly frames November’s elections as ones that will determine whether the country slips toward authoritarianism.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump-backed candidates, many of whom have openly claimed without evidence that the 2020 election was fraudulent or that Biden is an illegitimate president, will be on the ballot at the state and federal level in November. And Trump himself is weighing another presidential bid in 2024 even amid a federal investigation involving the mishandling of classified documents after he left the White House.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden has in recent weeks become more assertive in calling out “MAGA Republicans.” At a political rally last week in Maryland, Biden described the movement as akin to “semi-fascism.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday in Pennsylvania, Biden referenced “MAGA Republicans” multiple times as he invoked the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, condemning attacks from some Republicans on law enforcement.\n\n\n\nHe has also portrayed Republicans as anti-law enforcement by accusing them of excusing violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and fueling attacks on the FBI following the bureau’s search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome Republicans have criticized Biden for his comments, arguing he campaigned on a pledge to unite the country and lower the temperature of the nation but is using inflammatory rhetoric by comparing conservatives to fascists.\n\n\n\n“Joe Biden is the divider-in-chief and epitomizes the current state of the Democrat Party: one of divisiveness, disgust, and hostility towards half the country,” Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement in advance of Thursday’s speech.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in a prebuttal to Biden’s speech from Scranton demanded the president apologize for his remark last week about “MAGA” Republicans espousing a philosophy akin to “semi-fascism.”\n\n\n\n“President Biden has chosen to divide, demean and disparage his fellow Americans. Why? Simply because they disagree with his policies. That is not leadership,” McCarthy said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s speech was a return of sorts to an overarching theme of his 2020 campaign, and could preview his rhetoric should he follow through with his intention to run for reelection in 2024 in a possible rematch with Trump.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Wall Street Journal poll released Thursday found Biden leading Trump by 6 percentage points in a hypothetical rematch of the 2020 election.\n\n\n\n“I think the message that he’s sending is extremely effective,” said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, noting the revelations of the Jan. 6 congressional hearings and the Mar-a-Lago search that showcased Trump’s “disregard for the rule of law.”\n\n\n\n“I think this is the perfect moment because it’s kind of a culmination,” Lake said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUpdated 9:10 p.m.",

Along with Counsell’s tendency to make full use of expanded 40-man rosters in past seasons, the late success in some seasons has led many to affectionately refer to the regular season’s final month as “Craigtember.”\nAnother Craigtember is necessary for the Brewers to play meaningful October baseball, and they have an opportunity to make it happen with a break in the schedule. They kick off the month with a four-game series against the Diamondbacks on the road.\nBrandon Woodruff gets the start for the Brewers, and Merrill Kelly is on the bump for the Diamondbacks.\n\n\nWho's staying up with us?  ‍♂️ : @BallySportWI  : @620wtmj #ThisIsMyCrew pic.twitter.com/GKT4bdC4wf— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nGame 130. pic.twitter.com/8dpRUxzkQk— Arizona Diamondbacks (@Dbacks) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nFirst pitch is scheduled for 8:40 p.m. CDT.",

        "link": "https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/09/01/beegu/",
        "description": "For all the hopeful creatures.\n\nThere are a thousand and one ways to feel alien in this world &#8212; some of them blatant (my legal status in the country to which I have devoted my entire adult life is &#8220;resident alien&#8221;) and some subtle (who hasn&#8217;t known those days when everything appears to be alright, but the sky of the mind feels profoundly askew?) Mostly, we go through this world alien to each other &#8212; even with our maximal empathic understanding, the abyss between any two consciousnesses is so immense that it can fit a universe. This awareness is what Nina Simone channeled when she sang, &#8220;I wish you could know what it means to be me.&#8221; On it Thomas Nagel anchored his iconic unanswerable question of what it is like to be a bat. &#8220;Self-discovery,&#8221; Octavio Paz wrote in his superb meditation on otherness, &#8220;is above all the realization that we are alone: it is the opening of an impalpable, transparent wall &#8212; that of our consciousness &#8212; between the world and ourselves.&#8221;\nEnglish artist and author Alexis Deacon explores this elemental reality with uncommon tenderness in Beegu (public library), originally published in 2003 &#8212; the year I began my alien life in America, when Deacon himself was only just entering the disorienting universe of adulthood after finishing college. \n\n&#8220;Beegu was not supposed to be here,&#8221; the story begins. A strange sweet creature has landed on Earth, where no one seems to understand her. \n\n\nShe tries to talk to the bunnies, who most look like her, but they wouldn&#8217;t talk back. \nShe questions the tree, but the tree stays silent. \nShe talks at the windswept leaves, but they &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t even stay still to listen.&#8221;\n\nIn her castaway blues, she thinks she can hear her mother calling from afar &#8212; but it is only the sound of longing. \n\nFeeling woefully alone, Beegu sets out to find some friends. But no one would even stop to regard her. \n\nEventually, she nestles between some newborn puppies in a box left outside an animal shelter and falls asleep.\n\nBut when the human attendant arrives in the morning, he throws the strange small creature back into the street, unable to fold her strangeness into the scope of his compassionate imagination. \n\n\nWandering alone through the grey city, Beegu finally finds what seems like the perfect place &#8212; a playground full of children, who meet her strangeness with delight rather than disdain and immediately invite her into their games. \n\n\nBut when the teacher comes, grown and stern, she too takes one look at the alien creature and casts her away as the children cry for their new friend. \n\n\nAs a bittersweet parting gift, they give her a red hula hoop, which she takes with her into the austere lonesome night.\n\n\n\nThe story ends the way life rarely does &#8212; Beegu&#8217;s parents return with their spaceship to retrieve her. \n\nSurrounded once again by love &#8212; the infinite lung that makes the atmosphere of loneliness breathable &#8212; she gets to tell them about the lonely-making planet she visited, where the &#8220;creatures were mostly big and unfriendly, but there were some small ones who seemed hopeful.&#8221;\n\n\n\nComplement Beegu with a very different yet kindred lens on the loneliness of childhood in Before I Grew Up and a lyrical meditation on that alien feeling in Over the Rooftops, Under the Moon, then revisit Virginia Woolf on the relationship between loneliness and creativity and her contemporary counterpart Olivia Laing&#8217;s endlessly nourishing The Lonely City.\ndonating = lovingFor a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the unbearable name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

        "description": "Photo by Nick Cammett/Getty Images\n    \n\n  A grueling, joyless event to witness If you’ve been holding out on calling the Guardians “in a funk” you can probably stop now. Just call it what it is — they’re bad right now. One game, one big inning, could turn that around in an instant. But until it does, they are a rough team to watch at the plate every night. \nThis 3-0 loss to the Orioles is their fifth in their last seven games, and it’s the third time they have been shut out in their last four contests. Tonight was especially grim because they managed just two hits off of rookie starter Kyle Bradish and ... nothing else. That was it. A few walks were sprinkled about, but the Guardians offense was mowed down in 1-2-3 fashion four times and did not look competitive at any point. \nThe hardest hit ball from the Guardians came from Amed Rosario — a 100.4 mph groundout. Maybe there are a few games that I’ve intentionally blanked out of my memory, but I can’t remember the last time the 2022 Guardians felt so defeated for the entire game. \nAndre Knott mentioned towards the end of the game that Sandy Alomar had talked to José Ramírez and Amed Rosario about “picking it up,” even when they don’t get a hit. Just be a presence and bring some energy to the game. The conversation was framed as a rosey pick-me-up kind of pep talk, but I wonder how much of that was Sandy trying to tell two of his veteran leaders to wake the hell up. \nThey didn’t, and neither did the rest of the offense.\nIt’s a shame, too, because Shane Bieber pitched a gem outside of a few hard-hit balls. He tied his season-high with 11 strikeouts (the other 11 K game came against these Orioles on June 3), but he allowed three solo home runs and was ousted after seven innings. He gave up a lot of loud contact but managed to limit the ones that stayed in the park to harmless base hits and outs. \nThe Guards will get a chance to brush this series off and rebound against the Mariners this weekend.",

        "description": "The Cardinals announced they&#8217;ve selected outfielder Ben DeLuzio onto the big league roster and recalled reliever James Naile from Triple-A Memphis. They&#8217;ll take the two extra active roster spots available to teams in September. St. Louis already had an opening on the 40-man roster.\nIt&#8217;s the first big league call for DeLuzio, who has spent six years in the professional ranks. An undrafted free agent out of Florida State in 2016, the right-handed hitting outfielder first signed with the Diamondbacks. DeLuzio would spend the next five years in the organization, using his speed to post strong results on balls in play but never hitting for much power. The Florida native never hit more than four home runs in a minor league season, and his strikeout rate began to mount as he hit the Double-A level.\nArizona didn&#8217;t add DeLuzio to the 40-man roster, and he was made eligible in the minor league portion of the Rule 5 draft last offseason. The Cardinals selected him with the 17th pick and assigned him to Memphis. (Unlike those taken in the big league portion of the Rule 5 draft, minor league selections don&#8217;t have to be added to the MLB active roster). DeLuzio has responded with arguably the best season of his career, posting strong numbers in 94 games to earn his first MLB call.\nThrough 408 plate appearances, the 28-year-old has a .277/.353/.429 line. His nine home runs aren&#8217;t the mark of a power hitter, but it shatters his previous personal high. The athleticism upon which he&#8217;s long relied has remained intact, as he&#8217;s swiped 30 bases in 36 attempts while playing over 700 innings in center field. DeLuzio isn&#8217;t likely to get many starts with the Cardinals looking to wrap up the NL Central over the season&#8217;s final month, but he adds a speed and defense oriented player whom manager Oliver Marmol can creatively deploy late in games.\nRobert Murray of FanSided first reported DeLuzio&#8217;s promotion this morning.",

        "description": "Passenger complaints have soared as airlines canceled and delayed flights this year, but reliability has varied between airlines.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) released its latest air travel consumer report late last month, noting that roughly 24 percent of commercial flights between destinations in the United States did not arrive on time in the first half of the year. \n\n\n\nThe figure is a 52 percent jump from the same period last year, although carriers operated fewer flights in 2021 as more Americans avoided flying out of concerns of catching COVID-19.\n\n\n\nTravel demand has now resurged to levels not seen since before the pandemic, but the airline industry has struggled to meet the influx of passengers, facing issues like staffing shortages, severe weather and high fuel costs. Some airlines have also placed blame on labor shortages at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\n\n\nHere’s how airlines’ on-time arrival percentages ranked during the first six months of 2022:\n\n\n\n1. Hawaiian Airlines: 82.14 percent\n\n\n\nHawaiian Airlines beat out other airlines for the top spot, with more than 8 in 10 of its scheduled U.S. flights arriving on time.\n\n\n\nThe airline is smaller than the other nine included in the DOT’s analysis, and Hawaiian also outranked the other carriers last year.\n\n\n\nAbout 91 percent of Hawaiian’s U.S. flights during the first six months of 2021 arrived on time.\n\n\n\n“We are proud of our frontline teams and everyone supporting our operations for getting our guests to their destination on time and with aloha, while maintaining our industry-leading punctuality record,” said Hawaiian Airlines spokesperson Alex Da Silva.\n\n\n\n2. Delta Air Lines: 80.75 percent\n\n\n\nDelta Air Lines and flights operated by regional carriers marketed under the Delta brand were ranked No. 2 in the DOT’s report.\n\n\n\nFlights operated by Delta itself slightly outpaced the on-time arrival percentage of its regional carriers. Just over 80 percent of U.S. Delta-operated flights arrived on time, about a percentage point higher than its codeshare partners.\n\n\n\nDelta has touted its leading record in its promotional appeal to customers, saying on Wednesday it was prepared to carry up to 2.9 million passengers over the upcoming busy Labor Day travel weekend.\n\n\n\n“We’re looking forward to welcoming our customers on board for Labor Day weekend,” Allison Ausband, Delta’s chief customer experience officer, said in a statement. “We’ve taken steps this summer to ensure our people have the tools and support they need to deliver on our high standards for reliability, while offering Delta’s signature customer service with warmth and care.”\n\n\n\n3. Alaska Airlines: 78.91 percent\n\n\n\nAlaska Airlines and its codeshare partners clocked in at No. 3 on the list, with just under 8 in 10 U.S. flights arriving on time during the first half of the year.\n\n\n\nFlights branded as Alaska Airlines but operated by its regional partners, Horizon Air and SkyWest Airlines, arrived on time about 81 percent of the time, slightly more often than those operated by Alaska itself.\n\n\n\nAn Alaska Airlines spokesperson did not return a request for comment.\n\n\n\n4. United Airlines: 76.92 percent\n\n\n\nUnited Airlines’ on-time arrival percentage registered about two percentage points below Alaska, with 76.92 percent of U.S. United Airlines-marketed flights arriving on time in the first half of 2022.\n\n\n\nThe figure marks a dip from the same period in 2021, when 83.47 of the airlines’ marketed flights arrived on time. United similarly ranked No. 4 during that period when compared to the other carriers.\n\n\n\nUnited achieved its highest second-quarter revenue in the company’s history this year, which was also the airline’s first profitable quarter since the start of the pandemic.\n\n\n\nA United Airlines spokesperson did not return a request for comment.\n\n\n\n5. American Airlines: 76.75 percent\n\n\n\nAmerican Airlines, which marketed more flights than any other carrier in the first half of the year, clocked in near the middle of the pack, barely behind United Airlines.\n\n\n\nLike United, a slight majority of flights marketed by American Airlines were operated by the carriers’ regional partners.\n\n\n\nThose regional carriers’ flights arrived on time 78.01 percent of the time, compared to 75.33 percent of those operated by American Airlines.\n\n\n\nPilot unions at three regional carriers wholly owned by American Airlines — Envoy Air, Piedmont Airlines and PSA Airlines — recently announced contract agreements that include significant pay increases as part of their efforts to attract and retain pilots.\n\n\n\n6. Southwest Airlines: 73.87 percent\n\n\n\nJust under 74 percent of Southwest Airlines flights arrived on time in the first half of the year, earning the carrier sixth place out of the 10 airlines assessed by the DOT.\n\n\n\nAs the industry faces scheduling snafus in part due to labor shortages, the airline said in a statement that it has grown its full-time equivalent employee base to more than 62,000, which is higher than its number of employees at the end of 2019.\n\n\n\n“While on-time performance through June was down, our flight completion factor has recently been among the highest in the industry,” the airline said.\n\n\n\nMost other major carriers use a hub-and-spoke system in which airlines concentrate flights in a handful of central airports. But Southwest is one of a few exceptions, instead leveraging a point-to-point strategy that offers direct flights between many smaller airports.\n\n\n\n7. Spirit Airlines: 69.31 percent\n\n\n\nRoughly 7 in 10 Spirit Airlines flights arrived on time between January and June, placing the low-cost carrier at No. 7 in the DOT's ranking.\n\n\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Spirit Airlines spokesperson pointed to the company’s statement last month indicating its operational performance ranked among the industry best in the two months after Spirit’s peak summer schedule went into effect on June 5.\n\n\n\n\"These great results are among the best in the industry and are due to the relentless dedication of our Spirit family,” John Bendoraitis, the company’s chief operating officer, said in the statement. “Our team rose to the occasion to serve record numbers of summer travelers and work through industry challenges to deliver a high value experience for our guests.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\n8. Frontier Airlines: 64.50 percent\n\n\n\nMore than a third of Frontier Airlines flights did not arrive on time so far in 2022, according to the DOT.\n\n\n\nAbout 81 percent of Frontier’s flights arrived on time during the first half of 2021.\n\n\n\nThe airline is one of the country’s smaller commercial carriers, marketing the third-lowest number of flights out of the 10 assessed by the DOT, with only Hawaiian and Spirit airlines marketing fewer flights.\n\n\n\nA Frontier Airlines spokesperson did not return a request for comment.\n\n\n\n9. JetBlue Airways: 62.08 percent\n\n\n\nAbout 62 percent of JetBlue flights arrived on time in the first half of 2022.\n\n\n\nJetBlue spokesperson Derek Dombrowski said 70 percent of the airline’s flights touch the northeast corridor, a congested air traffic region often plagued by severe weather events. The airline was also impacted by air traffic control constraints in April and by sick calls due to the pandemic, he said.\n\n\n\nMultiple airlines have placed blame on staffing challenges at air traffic control centers manned by the  FAA, which at times have led to delayed flights. The challenges have been especially pronounced in New York and Florida.\n\n\n\n“JetBlue has taken a number of steps to improve our operation and reliability, and our completion factor has greatly improved in recent months,” Dombrowski said, noting that the airline now has record levels of staffing following a spring hiring and training push.\n\n\n\n“These investments have brought a significant improvement despite continued constraints on the air traffic system in New York and Florida,” he added.\n\n\n\n10. Allegiant Air: 61.63 percent\n\n\n\nAllegiant Air clocked in at the bottom of the DOT’s list, with 61 percent of flights arriving on time. Roughly 74 percent of Allegiant’s flights in the first half of 2021 arrived on time.\n\n\n\nThe airline said in a statement that some of its crews maxed out on the number of hours they could fly under FAA regulations during the first half of the year, and limited availability of backup crews caused a number of delays. \n\n\n\nAllegiant, like other airlines, said it also grappled with crews being out of service due to COVID-19 outbreaks and faces an “unprecedented” labor shortage.\n\n\n\n“We are actively working to mitigate it by offering extra incentives to attract and retain employees, including higher wages, bonuses, work schedule flexibility and more,” the airline said.",

Biden on Thursday responded to the hecklers during his prime-time speech in Philadelphia, saying that a democracy allows them to protest.\n\n\n\n“They’re entitled to be outrageous. This is a democracy,” the president said in the middle of his remarks.\n\n\n\nProtesters yelled from outside of the Independence National Historical Park: “Let’s go, Brandon” and “F Joe Biden.” The phrase “Let’s Go Brandon” quickly became a political slogan adopted former President Trump’s base after a TV commentator mistakenly interpreted a crowd chanting of “f--- Joe Biden” as “Let’s Go Brandon,” in support of NASCAR driver Brandon Brown.\n\n\n\nBiden’s speech on Thursday was&nbsp;centered around warning&nbsp;that Trump and Republicans aligned with him are threats to the country. It was framed beforehand as remarks about “the soul of the nation.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden also snapped back at those yelling during his remarks, saying, “good manners is nothing they’ve ever suffered from,”&nbsp;according to&nbsp;Reuters White House reporter Jeff Mason.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe president emphasized in his remarks the danger of MAGA-aligned Republicans, arguing that they cast doubt on election results, spread conspiracy theories, attack law enforcement, do not respect the Constitution and have blind loyalty for Trump.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden has had other interruptions during speeches throughout his presidency. In July, the president&nbsp;was interrupted by Manuel Oliver, the father of mass shooting victim Joaquin Oliver, during an event at the White House.\n\n\n\nBiden responded, “let him talk, let him talk” when Oliver appeared to suggest that the bipartisan gun control bill did not go far enough.",

        "description": "Photo by Nick Cammett/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Pitching led the way to an Orioles win, allowing them to gain ground in the AL Wild Card race. Three home runs and another stellar start for Kyle Bradish led the Orioles to a 3-0 win on Thursday night in Cleveland, clinching the series and gaining ground in the AL Wild Card race.\nBradish is the headliner here. The rookie right-hander has had a roller coaster season, from the dizzying heights of that start in St. Louis to a dreadful stretch thereafter that ended with him on the IL. He has looked like a different pitcher since getting back onto the active roster, and these last two starts have been otherworldly.\nThe 25-year-old followed up eight shutout innings in Houston last week with seven more zeroes in Cleveland. It is a remarkable turnaround for a young pitcher, hitting his stride right when the Orioles need it most.\nBradish needed some help from his defense, particularly Gunnar Henderson, who turned a double play and made a nice diving stop to keep his pitcher out of a jam. But this was not an especially stressful outing for Bradish. He only threw 94 pitches. He only allowed two hits. Most of the contact he allowed was weak, and his three walks were easy enough to work around as a result.\n\n\n*SportsCenter noises* pic.twitter.com/0lJG54OEkn— Baltimore Orioles (@Orioles) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nAnd the bullpen was lights out behind. Cionel Pérez needed just 12 pitches to toss a clean eighth inning, striking out two in the process. Felix Bautista came in a little wild and issued a walk, but a pep talk from Rougned Odor and the rest of the infield seemed to settle him, and he closed things outs from there.\nThere wasn’t much to note on the offensive side of things for the O’s. All three runs came on home runs. Cedric Mullins hit the very first pitch of the game out for a home run to right field. Anthony Santander followed with a first-pitch homer of his own later on in the same inning. And then it was Ryan Mountcastle with the final blow, a long drive to left-center field in the fourth inning.\n\n\nCeddy starting the entertainment early tonight!   pic.twitter.com/y5CKf5QdOs— Baltimore Orioles (@Orioles) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nThe lineup combined for four other hits, all singles. Odor had two of them, Henderson added one, and Ramon Urías had the last one. Odor and Henderson also swiped a bag each, the first of Henderson’s big league career.\nThere were plenty of strikeouts from the Orioles offense, 13 to be exact. Debutant Jesús Aguilar and rookie Terrin Vavra went down on strikes three times each. But that’s life against Shane Bieber, one of the best pitchers in baseball. There is no shame there. Of course, it might mean Kyle Stowers gets some at-bats sometime soon, but that might not be such a bad thing either.\nIt was one of those games where the team was not exactly firing on all cylinders. Three runs is not usually enough to win a game, especially when your defense also makes two errors. But the O’s pitching staff picked everybody else up and paved a path to victory. The Orioles will need that to happen a few more times to make a serious push into the playoffs.\nSpeaking of which, it was a light night of work for scoreboard watchers. The only relevant team in action was the Mariners. They beat the Tigers 7-0, drawing even with the Rays for the top wild card spot. The win for the O’s puts them 1.5 games back of the idle Blue Jays for the final playoff spot in the AL.\nThe Orioles welcome in the Oakland Athletics for a three-game set at Camden Yards starting tomorrow night. Every game is crucial this time of year, but anything less than a sweep is going to feel disappointing. The A’s stink, and they just got knocked around by the Nationals this week. Game 1 begins at 7:05 with Dean Kremer on the mound.",

        "description": "Benny Sieu-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Hiura, who leads the team in OPS entering Thursday night’s game against Arizona, is mashing righties this season Welcome to SB Nation Reacts, a survey of fans across the MLB. Throughout the year we ask questions of the most plugged-in Milwaukee Brewers fans and fans across the country. Sign up here to participate.\nIn this week’s edition of SB Nation Reacts, we asked Brewers fans if Keston Hiura deserves a spot in the starting lineup, to which an overwhelming 90% of you said yes.\nHiura, who has two walk-off home runs this season already, leads the team in OPS entering Thursday night at .851.\nAfter a tough start to the season that saw him demoted to AAA on multiple occasions, he’s slashing .269/.321/.635 with six homers and 12 RBIs since the All-Star break in just 17 games (13 starts).\nHis splits between wins and losses are especially stark, as he has a .289/.378/.588 slash line in wins compared to just .195/.303/.403 in losses. While he’s had several tough seasons since a breakout 2019 campaign, Hiura should continue to get more opportunities in the stretch run if he can keep hitting.\nWhile a day-to-day injury of Rowdy Tellez has allowed Tellez to remain in the lineup as a DH, Hiura has taken over at first base this week. We’ll see what Craig Counsell decides to do with Hiura moving forward, but it’s clear how fans feel about him at this point.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3625030-white-house-officials-reject-criticism-biden-speech-was-political/",
        "description": "White House officials on Thursday pushed back against criticism that President Biden’s prime-time speech, in which he warned that former President Trump and his ideology pose a threat to democracy, was overly political in nature, arguing that Biden was simply recognizing the urgency of the issue.\n\n\n\nBiden delivered a speech from Independence Hall in Philadelphia in which he said Trump and other so-called “MAGA Republicans” have embraced ideas corrosive to democracy, like denying election results,  spreading conspiracy theories and attacking law enforcement.\n\n\n\nBut Republicans and some in the media seized on Biden’s criticisms of Trump and his supporters, as well as the Marines stationed behind the president as he spoke, to suggest Biden had given an overtly political speech despite press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre insisting earlier in the day the remarks would not be.\n\n\n\n“Whatever you think of this speech, the military is supposed to be apolitical. Positioning Marines in uniform behind President Biden for a political speech flies in the face of that. It’s wrong when Democrats do it. It’s wrong when Republicans do it,” CNN anchor Brianna Keilar, whose husband is in the military, tweeted.\n\n\n\n“Like or loathe what he said tonight, it should be noted: The president spoke tonight on the grounds of a national park, flanked by US Marines, and took direct, specific aim at his predecessor and members of the Republican Party,” CBS correspondent Ed O’Keefe tweeted. “Another thing we don’t see everyday.”\n\n\n\nBret Baier, a Fox News anchor, said on air after the speech that it was reminiscent of a convention speech.\n\n\n\nRep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.) tweeted that Biden’s speech “was just another opportunity to disparage his fellow Americans. Disgraceful.”\n\n\n\nWhite House officials pushed back strongly against those who suggested the president’s speech was political, arguing the issue of defending democracy is not a partisan issue and that Biden was simply reciting facts about Trump and his supporters.\n\n\n\nAndrew Bates, a deputy press secretary at the White House, responded to individual journalists who suggested the speech had political undertones with links from their own news outlets describing threats to U.S. democracy.\n\n\n\n“Democracy is not a partisan or political issue,” tweeted deputy press secretary Chris Meagher, responding directly to Keilar’s tweet.\n\n\n\n“Many great journalists have reported as fact that the former President &amp; his most loyal supporters in Congress are a threat to democracy. They tried to overthrow an election, including by force,” tweeted Jesse Lee, a communications adviser to the National Economic Council. “The President bluntly described the same facts. It’s not ‘political,’ it’s his duty.”\n\n\n\nBiden used his speech to warn that Trump and so-called “MAGA Republicans” who back his views pose a grave threat to the country’s democratic values, echoing a message that he delivered throughout the 2020 campaign.\n\n\n\n\"As I stand here tonight equality and democracy are under assault,\" Biden said. “Too much of what’s happening in our country today is not normal. Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.”",

        "description": "Dale Zanine-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Rockies hitters record two total hits, 16 strikeouts It wasn’t simply the best start of his career: Spencer Strider just tossed one of the best pitching performances in Atlanta Braves history.\n\n\n#Rockies Update:Spencer Strider has struck out 16. That’s the most in Atlanta’s franchise history since 1900 for a starter going eight innings. Dang.— Patrick Lyons (@PatrickDLyons) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nStrider has made 30 MLB appearances in his two-year career. Never has he completed seven innings; he finished eight tonight. Never has he struck out more than 13; he had 16 this evening against the Rockies.\n26 batters stepped to the plate in the first four innings, just two more than the minimum 24. It gave us a good old-fashioned see saw on the win probability chart, but Atlanta’s Austin Riley was the first to tip the scale with a solo home run in the fourth.\n  \n        \n  \nA leadoff single by C.J. Cron would provide some life in the next half-inning, but a strikeout-heavy fifth inning would end the threat for the Braves.\nThe scale would tip further from there. Colorado starter Chad Kuhl had a tough end to his night, and in his second start off the injured list, his season ERA remains north of five.\nStrider’s final line: 8 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 0 BB, 16 K\nIf not for Cron’s leadoff single in the fifth inning, Strider would have taken a perfect game into the eighth.\nOne runner advanced past first base for the Rockies tonight, coming in Strider’s fatigued final inning. A one-out double by Michael Toglia (stay hot, young man) placed a runner in scoring position.\nA ground-ball error would advance him to third base, but Strider’s 15th and 16th strikeouts would immediately follow, putting a stamp on a near-flawless showing.\n\n\nIs Spencer Strider’s four-seamer the best pitch in baseball?— Nick Pollack (@PitcherList) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nStrider struck out at least two hitters in six of his eight innings.\nChad Kuhl’s final line: 4 2⁄3 IP, 5 H, 3 R, 1 BB, 7 K\nAtlanta’s offensive performance in the first three innings was limited to a two-out single by Austin Riley in the first inning. Rockies starter Chad Kuhl was otherwise perfect through 3 1⁄3 innings, but the Braves would then find themselves on the board with Riley’s fourth-inning homer.\n(For the first four innings, sans Riley, it was an exceptional pitching performance by Kuhl.)\nThe fifth inning would immediately open with a home run by Atlanta’s Michael Harris II, and a single to follow by Vaughn Grissom was another early threat for a long fifth inning. Kuhl quickly worked two flyouts from there, but a two-out walk to Ronald Acuña Jr. would set the table for a Dansby Swanson RBI single to follow. Kuhl would then exit the game with three runs allowed, one out shy of five innings, leaving runners on the corners for the Rockies bullpen.\nHe did collect seven strikeouts against a tough-hitting playoff contender. Hard-hit baseballs were costly, but Kuhl’s night was optimistic when he was ahead in counts.\nColorado bullpen tosses 3 1⁄3 scoreless frames\nThe Rockies’ clear bright spot in this contest was the effort of relief pitchers — and it wasn’t the usual suspects of Carlos Estévez and Daniel Bard posting zeros today. \nJustin Lawrence, Dinelson Lamet and Chad Smith combined to sit down all 10 batters they faced. Each of them collected two strikeouts, giving the Rockies a combined total of 13 K’s in eight innings on the mound.\nWith seven by Kuhl and 16 by Strider, this game saw a combined 29 strikeouts.\nRockies tame top Atlanta hitters\nWithout Austin Riley and his 2-for-4 showing, the Braves collected three total hits.\nA 0-for-4 showing by leadoff hitter Ronald Acuña Jr., and a 0-for-3, three strikeout evening by four-hitter Matt Olson stood as one source of optimism for the Rockies in a pitching-heavy contest.\nJansen collects save number 31\nColorado’s top of the order stepped to the plate in the ninth inning against old divisional foe Kenley Jansen. Three consecutive flyouts were more uplifting than the strikeout parade put on by Strider, but the Rockies otherwise went quietly into the night, capping off a night of little offensive production.\nUp Next\nThe Rockies are narrow betting favorites against the Cincinnati Reds in Friday’s series opener. Kyle Freeland will look to chip away at a 4.88 ERA with Cincinnati’s Luis Cessa (5.36) making his 40th appearance of the season. Both teams will open the three-game set at 4:40 p.m. MDT",

But tonight the President get serious in a way that members of his party seldom seem to do.\n\n“There’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.”\n\nNews evaporates in the United States, and bold statements too. But if the President's voice can have not just reach but staying power, then this will have been an important moment for the country, for the election coming up, and beyond.\nHaving allies helps with reach, for we can all amplify and extend the message and its implications, if we care to stir ourselves. Staying power is touchier, since organizations like Fox were probably trying to drown out the speech before it even commenced. Amplify and extend, amplify and extend. Lather, rinse, repeat. Repeat.

        "description": "Republicans are blasting President Biden’s prime-time address Thursday evening, which portrayed former President Trump and his supporters as a threat to democracy, casting the speech as condescending and at odds with uniting the country.\n\n\n\n“Divider-in-Chief at his finest tonight,” Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.) wrote on Twitter.\n\n\n\n“President Biden took to the airwaves tonight to divide this country,” he wrote in a separate tweet. “This ‘state of the American democracy’ speech was just another opportunity to disparage his fellow Americans. Disgraceful.”\n\n\n\nThe White House had marketed Biden’s speech in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia as one about “the soul of the nation,” a phrase then-candidate Biden often used during his 2020 presidential campaign.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, Biden used the speech to frame the upcoming midterm elections as a choice about whether the country will slip toward authoritarianism, repeatedly referring to Trump by name and tying his Make America Great Again movement to corrosive, anti-democratic ideas, like unfounded claims of election fraud.White House officials pushed back strongly against notions that the speech was political, arguing that defending democracy is not a partisan issue.\n\n\n\nBiden rounded out the address by touting recent policy wins on issues like police funding and the pandemic, but Republicans quickly rebutted the speech by emphasizing high inflation and crime rates, which have stymied Biden’s approval ratings.\n\n\n\n“With all due respect Mr. President, there’s nothing wrong with America’s soul,” tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). “The American people are hurting because of your policies. Rampant inflation. Out of control crime. Terrorism on the rise. Broken borders. Stop lecturing &amp; change your policies before it’s too late.”\n\n\n\nGraham’s sentiment was echoed by many other Republicans.\n\n\n\n“What would help the ‘soul of the nation’ much more than a condescending lecture from President Biden is getting inflation under control instead of actively spending more money to make it worse,” Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) wrote on Twitter.\n\n\n\nOthers in the GOP condemned Biden’s increasingly stark criticisms of “MAGA Republicans,” accusing him of factionalizing the country.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany of those Republicans who lambasted Biden are speculated to be gearing up for presidential campaigns of their own in 2024, potentially setting up a head-to-head matchup with Biden down the road.\n\n\n\n“That was a campaign speech under the guise of a presidential address,” Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) tweeted.\n\n\n\n“Instead of focusing on issues impacting Americans, Biden demonized half the country to distract from his failures,” he continued. “We need leaders who work to make this nation stronger &amp; safer, instead of tearing us apart.”\n\n\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Halley called Biden the most condescending president of her lifetime.\n\n\n\n“He’s done nothing to unite the nation,” she tweeted. “Nothing to bring healing. Nothing to alleviate the pain millions of Americans feel everyday. He’s been a divider in chief and come November he must hear from all of us.”\"After much soul searching, President Biden has decided the greatest threat to American values are his political opponents,\" Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) wrote on Twitter.\n\n\n\nMultiple Republicans on Twitter shared an image of Biden during the speech with his fists raised in the air in front of Independence Hall, which was lit up red. \n\n\n\n“He came across as a sad, angry, kind of bitter old man here,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) told guest host Raymond Arroyo on Fox News’s “The Ingraham Angle,” before comparing Biden's appearance to Darth Vader from the Star Wars franchise.\n\n\n\nJordan proceeded to lay out a laundry list of what he views as Biden’s policy failures, like annual inflation rates that recently hit roughly 40-year highs, gas prices that in June exceeded $5 per gallon on average and issues at the border.\n\n\n\n“I think the nation would like those addressed versus being called extremists and fascists, and have the government now target your freedoms and liberties like we have seen from the Biden administration Justice Department,” Jordan said on Fox News.Biden had called the “extreme MAGA philosophy” aligned with former President Trump as “like semi-fascism\" during a speech last week. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called on Biden to apologize for the remark just prior to his primetime address.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/braves-notes-soroka-oday-albies-acuna.html",
        "description": "The Braves announced this afternoon that righty Mike Soroka has been activated from the 60-day injured list. He&#8217;s been optioned to Triple-A Gwinnett. To open a spot on the 40-man roster, Atlanta transferred reliever Darren O&#8217;Day from the 15-day to the 60-day IL.\nSoroka hasn&#8217;t thrown a major league pitch since August 2020. He ruptured his right Achilles tendon while trying to get off the mound to cover first base, a devastating injury that has kicked off multiple years of rehab. His efforts to return last season were cut short in June when Soroka suffered another Achilles tear while walking to the team&#8217;s clubhouse. He underwent a second surgery and has been trying to work his way back. He suffered an unrelated setback this July when he took a comebacker off the knee while throwing live batting practice, leading to another shutdown.\nSix weeks later, Soroka made it back to a professional mound. He kicked off a rehab assignment with High-A Rome on August 16, and he&#8217;s since made two appearances with Gwinnett. He worked 4 2/3 innings and threw 75 pitches during his outing last Saturday. That&#8217;ll technically be his final rehab start now that he&#8217;s back on the 40-man roster, but the club will give him a bit more time with the Stripers to find his form. With five weeks left in the regular season, it seems likely we&#8217;ll see Soroka back on the Truist Park mound this month. How he pitches could well determine whether the club carries him on their postseason roster.\nDespite having missed two seasons, Soroka just recently turned 25 years old. Before the Achilles tears, he looked like one of the better young arms in the sport. The former first-rounder pitched to a 2.68 ERA with a very strong 51.2% ground-ball rate over 174 2/3 innings in 2019, his age-21 season. He and the team agreed to a $2.8MM salary to avoid arbitration during Spring Training. He&#8217;ll be in line for a similar amount this winter and is controllable through 2024.\nO&#8217;Day has been out since the All-Star Break after straining his left calf. Signed to a minor league deal over the offseason, the veteran submariner made the Opening Day roster. O&#8217;Day has been an excellent, if unconventional, late-game reliever for much of the past decade. The 2022 season had been more pedestrian even before the injury, however. Through 21 2/3 innings, the 39-year-old owns a 4.15 ERA with a strong 27.7% strikeout percentage but a career-high 10.6% walk rate.\nToday&#8217;s IL transfer shouldn&#8217;t have much of an effect on O&#8217;Day, who still looks likely to factor into the bullpen mix for manager Brian Snitker late in the season. The 60-day minimal stint backdates to his original placement on July 12, so he&#8217;ll be eligible to return to the big league club next weekend. O&#8217;Day has been on a rehab assignment with Gwinnett, working seven innings over as many appearances.\nSoroka and O&#8217;Day aren&#8217;t the only injured players who are planning to make it back from long-term absences this month. Ozzie Albies has been out of action since fracturing his left foot on June 13, but he&#8217;s closing in on a return. Albies began a rehab assignment in Gwinnett tonight, taking four at-bats while serving as the designated hitter. It was his first game action since the injury, and it opens the 20-day window allotted to position players for rehab stints. Barring a setback, he should be back in Atlanta by the middle of September.\nSince Albies went down, the Braves have used a revolving door at second base. Orlando Arcia, Phil Gosselin and Ehire Adrianza have each gotten some work, but the job has finally fallen on rookie Vaughn Grissom. A highly-regarded prospect, Grissom is off to a .312/.354/.468 start through his first 21 MLB games. Those numbers have been propped up by a .344 batting average on balls in play, but the 21-year-old has also already connected on three home runs and has only gone down on strikes 13 times (15.9% of his plate appearances).\nHow the Braves will divvy up playing time when everyone&#8217;s healthy remains to be seen. That&#8217;s an enviable problem to have, of course, with an infield of Matt Olson, Albies, Dansby Swanson and Austin Riley arguably the best in baseball. If the Braves want to keep Grissom&#8217;s bat in the lineup, the cleanest path to playing time could be at designated hitter, although that&#8217;d present its own complications.\nThe Braves have rotated hot-hitting backup catcher William Contreras through the DH spot, and they&#8217;ve occasionally used those at-bats to get Ronald Acuña Jr. off his feet. Acuña, who tore the ACL in his right knee last July, told reporters last night the surgically-repaired joint feels &#8220;terrible&#8221; (via Gabe Burns of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution). Acuña has remained in the lineup and maintained that he&#8217;ll play through the pain for the rest of the season, but the Braves may want to continue easing his workload on defense before postseason play gets underway.",

        "description": "Photo by Harry How/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Marlins come in struggling, but Atlanta will have their hands full with Sandy Alcantara on the mound Friday.  After taking two of three from the Colorado Rockies, the Atlanta Braves will continue their homestand Friday when they begin a three-game series against the Miami Marlins. Atlanta improved to 81-51 behind a dominant performance by Spencer Strider in a 3-0 win Thursday night to keep pace with the New York Mets, who took two of three from the Dodgers. Atlanta will enter play Friday 3.0 games back in the NL East standings. \nIt has been another tough season for the Marlins, who come into Friday’s opener with a 55-75 record, good for fourth place in the NL East . Miami’s starting rotation ranks 12th in the majors in fWAR. However, they have been dragged down by an offense that is ranked 27th in the majors in runs scored, combining bottom-five offensive production with mediocre defense. Jazz Chisholm Jr. was enjoying a breakout season at the plate, but is on the Injured List along with offseason additions Avisail Garcia and Jorge Soler. Beyond that, there’s not much to really zero in on — Jon Berti is having a good season by combining average performance with great baserunning, and catcher Nick Fortes has played well in limited time to take some of the sting out of how awful Jacob Stallings has been, but there’s not much else there. Anthony Bass was great in relief and then got traded; he is still nearly 75 percent of the bullpen’s total fWAR despite not even being on the team for the last month.\nFriday, September 2, 7:20 p.m. ET (Apple TV+)\nSandy Alcantara (26 GS, 185.2 IP, 23.2 K%, 6.2 BB%, 2.13 ERA, 2.86 FIP)\nThe Braves will face Cy Young favorite Sandy Alcantara in the series opener Friday night. Alcantara has been dominant in two starts this season against Atlanta. He allowed six hits and three unearned runs in a complete game performance back on May 22. He came back six days later and allowed four hits, a run and struck out 14 over eight innings. Alcantara is coming off of one of his most impressive outings of the season where he allowed six hits, one run and struck out 10 in a complete game win over the Dodgers. The Braves’ best hope is that his abnormally-low HR/FB rate starts to creep up against them; Alcantara allowed homers in back-to-back starts (both against the Dodgers) for just the second time this season, and has only been taken deep 10 times total so far in 2022.\nCharlie Morton (25 GS, 140.1 IP, 28.6 K%, 8.5 BB%, 4.10 ERA, 3.97 FIP)\nCharlie Morton will make his 26th start of the season for the Braves in Friday’s series opener. Morton wasn’t sharp last time out, allowing five hits, three walks and four runs, including a pair of home runs, in five innings against the Cardinals. Morton only recorded four strikeouts which was his lowest totalsince May 25 against the Phillies. He has faced the Marlins once this season back on May 20 where he allowed seven hits, three runs and struck out five in 5 1/3 innings. \nSaturday, September 3, 7:20 p.m. ET (Bally Sports Southeast)\nEdward Cabrera (8 GS, 44.0 IP, 26.8 K%, 12.3 BB%, 2.45 ERA, 3.96 FIP)\nYoung right-hander Edward Cabrera will get the start for Miami on Saturday. Cabrera saw some action in June, but rejoined the Miami rotation on August 5 and has been impressive posting a 1.91 ERA and a 3.30 FIP in 28 1/3 innings. He didn’t allow a run in his first four starts in August (22 2/3 innings) before giving up six runs in 5 2/3 innings in his last start against the Dodgers. Cabrera faced the Braves once last season and allowed three hits, three walks and two runs in 3 2/3 innings. \nCabrera is a bit of an oddball as a changeup-first pitcher who has a five-pitch arsenal and really struggles to command his four-seamer, curve, and slider. His changeup isn’t really a “normal” changeup, as it’s more like a soft sinker, but it gives hitters a lot of trouble. It doesn’t get a lot of separation from his fastballs, which hitters have jumped all over so far; his breaking pitches don’t look effective on paper but seem to have bamboozled hitters so far as well.\nJake Odorizzi (17 GS, 85.1 IP, 18.3 K%, 6.7 BB%, 3.90 ERA, 4.22 FIP)\nJake Odorizzi will make his sixth start since joining the Braves in Saturday’s matchup. After struggling in his first three outings, Odorizzi has pitched better of late. He held the Pirates to four hits, one run and struck out seven in six innings two starts ago. He held the Cardinals scoreless through five in his last outing, before allowing a pair of runs to cross while trying to complete the sixth. He has 11 strikeouts and just one walk over his last 11 2/3 innings. It remains to be seen whether he’s going to try to implement his insane “75 percent four-seam fastballs” approach from the game against the Cardinals more going forward, or whether that was just a one-off. Odorizzi had a mediocre start against Miami on August 12, with a 2/1 K/BB ratio in four innings of work.\nSunday, September 4, 1:35 p.m. ET (Bally Sports Southeast)\nPablo Lopez (26 GS, 146.0 IP, 23.7 K%, 7.5 BB%, 3.64 ERA, 3.76 FIP)\nPablo Lopez will get the start in Sunday’s series finale. Lopez has been inconsistent of late, but got off to a terrific start in 2022 and has been solid overall for the Marlins. He allowed six runs and couldn’t make it out of the fifth inning two starts ago against the Padres. Since then, he has allowed two earned runs combined over his next two outings. He faced the Braves back on August 12 and allowed two runs in 5 2/3 innings. \nMax Fried (25 GS, 158.1 IP, 22.7 K%, 4.3 BB%, 2.56 ERA, 2.54 FIP)\nMax Fried will get the call for Atlanta in the series finale Sunday. Fried wasn’t sharp in his last start, but still gave the Braves an opportunity to win. He allowed seven hits and three runs, although only two were earned, over five innings against the Rockies. The unearned run came as a result of his first error of the season. It was an uncharacteristically problematic outing for the ace, and hopefully he rights the ship against another weak offense on Sunday Fried faced the Marlins back on May 29 and allowed six hits and one run over six innings.",

        "description": "Jordan Nwogu | Chloe Trofatter / USA TODAY NETWORK\n    \n\n  South Bend’s magic number drops to 3 with a win and a Beloit loss. Mixed rehab results for Adbert Alzolay and Michael Hermosillo. The Smokies also win.  Iowa Cubs\nThe Iowa Cubs were capsized by the Columbus Clippers (Guardians), 7-5.\nAdbert Alzolay made a rehab start here and the first inning went really well. A two-out walk but nothing else. As you’ve probably guessed by my highlighting the first inning, the second inning did not go well at all. Alzolay didn’t finish the second inning and left with a final line of four runs on four hits over 1.2 innings. He walked two, hit one batter and did not strike anyone out.\nCam Sanders had two solid innings of relief, giving up neither a run nor a hit. He did walk one batter while striking out three.\nAll five Iowa runs scored on home runs tonight.\nDH Michael Hermosillo is also on a rehab assignment, and he connected for his first home run of the year with a man on in the third inning. Hermosillo went 2 for 3 with a walk. He scored twice.\nFirst baseman Matt Mervis blasted (and I do mean blasted) a two-run home run in the eighth inning. It was Mervis’ seventh Iowa home run and 28th overall. He was 2 for 4.\nThird baseman Jared Young got the I-Cubs a run closer in the ninth with a solo home run. It was Young’s 16th home run this season. Young went 1 for 3 with a walk.\nMervis’ home run:\n\n\nMash Mervis leaves no doubt on home run number 28   pic.twitter.com/TjOQy41B9i— Iowa Cubs (@IowaCubs) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nHermosillo’s blast to center field.\n\n\nMichael Hermosillo goes deep to cut our deficit in half! His two-run blast is good for your @GreatClips Clip of the Game. pic.twitter.com/7wHU7zVDd4— Iowa Cubs (@IowaCubs) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nTennessee Smokies\nThe Tennessee Smokies routed the Mississippi Braves, 7-1.\nVery good start for Ryan Jensen tonight. He only went four innings. but he allowed no runs and just one hit. Jensen struck out five and walked two.\nBecause Jensen didn’t go five innings, the win went to Ben Hecht. Hecht relieved Jensen to start the fifth inning and lasted 1.1 innings. He allowed just one hit and no runs as well. Hecht walked one and struck out three.\nRight fielder Yonathan Perlaza’s 22nd home run this year was a solo home run in the sixth. Perlaza went 2 for 5 and scored two runs.\nFirst baseman Bryce Ball blew the game open with a three-run home run in the top of the seventh. Ball went 1 for 4 with a walk. He scored twice.\nThird baseman Jake Slaughter was 3 for 5 and scored once.\nCatcher Harrison Wenson opened the scoring with an RBI single in the second inning. Wenson went 2 for 4 with a double.\nSouth Bend Cubs\nThe South Bend Cubs broke the Lansing Lugnuts (Athletics), 3-1. The win, combined with the Sky Carp’s loss to the River Bandits, lowered the SB Cubs’ magic number to clinch a second-half title to three with nine games to play.\nStarter Luis Devers must be slipping because he gave up a run tonight. But he still picked up the win after giving up just the one run on four hits over five innings. Devers struck out eight and walked just one.\nMichael McAvene got a two-inning save tonight. He allowed no runs and just one hit. McAvene struck out two and walked no one.\nDH Jordan Nwogu was 2 for 4 with two RBI.\nRight fielder Owen Caissie was 2 for 4. He scored all the way from first base on a double by left fielder Yohendrick Pinango in the bottom of the eighth. Pinango went 1 for 4.\nThird baseman Luis Verdugo was 2 for 4. \nHighlights.\n\nMyrtle Beach Pelicans\nThe Myrtle Beach Pelicans were bitten by the Charleston RiverDogs (Rays), 7-6 in ten innings. \nGrant Kipp started tonight and was touched for four runs, three earned, on five hits over four innings. Kipp struck out four and walked one.\nAfter the Pelicans scored a run in the top of the tenth inning, Angel Gonzalez couldn’t hold the lead in the bottom of the inning. He gave up a two-run single with two out in the tenth and got the loss. The final line on Gonzalez was two runs on two hits and two walks over 1.2 innings. Gonzalez struck out three.\nRight fielder Ezequiel Pagan was 3 for 4 with a double and a walk. He had an RBI single as part of a four-run sixth inning and later scored that inning.\nFirst baseman Haydn McGeary was 2 for 4. McGeary also had an RBI single and scored a run in the sixth.\nThird baseman Josue Huma was 2 for 5 with a run scored.\nDH Kevin Alcantara was 2 for 6 with a stolen base. He scored once.",
