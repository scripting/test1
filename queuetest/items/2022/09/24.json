        "description": "Lousy framing in color, but good decision to convert it to monochrome, and Halos Heaven won’t be using this, so I might as well. | Photo by David Berding/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>In a snoozer, even Ohtani is kinda sloppy on the mound, but that’s unimportant against this injury-riddled Twins lineup.</p> <p>The Twins are officially eliminated from division contention after this one (they could still theoretically take the last wildcard spot if every Mariners player quits to join clown college). Hometown rookie pitcher Louis Varland is... OK. Shohei Ohtani is uncharacteristically walk-happy, and quite predictably the Twins don’t hurt him for it. Inning-by-inning notes:</p>\n<p>1: After a scoreless top from Varland, Ohtani sloppies his way into a one-out jam (BB, HBP, BB). We get your Gladdenism of the game when Atteberry asks “on the last Friday home game of the season, on Fan Appreciation Weekend, how about a Jake Cave grand slam?”</p>\n<p>Gladden: “Um. That’s asking a lot.”</p>\n<p>Instead, Cave lines one to second that Luis Rengifro almost catches. With the runners holding in case of a catch, Rengifro is easily able to throw out the runner at second, then Nick Gordon is tagged out going to third. A run scores and the inning’s over. How 2022 Twins 1-0</p>\n<p>2: Also how 2022 Twins. That lead disappears on one batter. Ohtani walks another Twin and nobody hits anything. I’m cooking beer. Probably drinking beer also. The stuff I cooked weeks ago. The stuff I’m cooking tonight needs yeast and time before it can provide Twins boredom relief. Tied 1-1</p>\n<p>3: Gary Sanchez drops a pop foul. Atteberry speculates that the drizzling rain got into his contacts. That’s not how contacts work, Kris. The batter eventually gets on and scores. Do you want his name? Do you need his name? It’s Boogers McBoogerbutt, that’s who it is. The Twins go down on nine pitches. California Angels 2-1</p>\n<p>4: One presumes Varland has family in the stands for his hometown debut. They’re North Saint Paul people, so you’ll know them for their tattoos and Fleet Farm hats. He does acceptably this inning.</p>\n<p>Another Ohtani walk gives Jake Cave and his .203 average a shot at REDEMPTION!!!</p>\n<p>(Oh, crap. Atteberry mentions that Cave had a “broken back” last year. A quick lookup clarifies that it involved a spinal disc fracture. I’ve had one of those. It was SCREAMING pain. I’m sorry, Jake Cave!)</p>\n<p>He does strike out, because Ohtani is better at pitching than Cave is at hitting, but no more making fun of him from me tonight. Gary Sanchez, who dropped that popup, also strikes out and I’d make fun of him but I don’t have any good ideas.</p>\n<p>5: Way to go, rook! After a leadoff double by Livan Soto, Varland strands him on third — with both Mike Trout and Ohtani up this inning. BAbip luck to be sure, but his family/friends will take that.</p>\n<p>Luis Arraez breaks up Ohtani’s no-hitter, one of the only reasons to continue following this game. Nothing comes of it.</p>\n<p>6: And there goes the other reason to keep following this game. Left in despite it being the dreaded “third time through the lineup,” Varland serves up a solo dong to Taylor Ward (who hit one in the second inning, too). He gets two more Angels out and is replaced by Trevor “Let The River Run” Megill. OK enough night for the young Varland. If you take away his solo homers to Aaron Judge, Jose Ramirez, and Ward here (all pretty notable sluggers), his ERA looks better. Then again, homers do count.</p>\n<p>Something on offense for Minnesota? Nick Gordon singles, Gio Urshela walks, and JAKE CAVE gets the RBI single! Go back injury guys go!</p>\n<p>Then Gary Sanchez strikes out looking. Except he doesn’t, he walks, because home plate umpire Hunter Wendelstedt utterly blows the call. Ohtani’s frustrated. Gladden is furious. Whomever the Angels manager is now brings in lefty Aaron Loup to face the bases-loaded, no-out situation.</p>\n<p>Is it a trap? Of course it is!</p>\n<p>Another Minnesota-born rookie, Matt Wallner, strikes out on three pitches, disappointing his family/friends from Forest Lake in the stands. (Eh, they’re suburbanites, they’re probably disappointed by all their children and anyone who isn’t them.) Twins team astrologer Gilberto Celestino, recently benched by Rocco for dogging it on a tag-up play, pinch-hits for guy-you-didn’t-know-was-on-the-team Mark Contreras. And Celestino GIDPs.</p>\n<p>Told ya it was a trap. Anaheim Angels 3-2</p>\n<p>7: Quick mention on Sanchez’s AB last inning. Atteberry was astounded that fans chanted “Ga-ry,” “Ga-ry” despite Sanchez hitting .183 at Target Field this season. He said that fans have done so all year. Then started talking about other Twins players who got their name chanted by fans, such as “Ed-die” Rosario and “Lewwwwwww” Ford. “It just seems like fans pick a guy whose name fits a chant,” Atteberry says.</p>\n<p>No doubt this began decades before I was born. But I can tell you who started the “Ed-die” chant for Guardado back in 2002.</p>\n<p>Because it was me. Home opener. I did it. Others followed my genius.</p>\n<p>This has been my great contribution to Twins fandom history.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, this game. Megill walks two guys. Caleb Thielbar comes in to face Ohtani. Ohtani wins. The Angels Angels Of Anaheim 4-2</p>\n<p>8: I won’t complain about this game being slow and boring, because my gutsier colleagues have done some brutal doubleheaders lately (sorry, BB!), but I do want it over. I want to watch “Corrections.” I love “Corrections.”</p>\n<p>As His Dark Materials, Emilio Enrique Pagán, enters, Atteberry checks off the all-time list of most HRs allowed by Twins relievers in a season. Ed-die matched Pagán’s current total of 14 one year and beat him with 16 once. Well, I still started the cheer.</p>\n<p>With two out and two on, my designated mockery target Sanchez whiffs. Why was this bad? Because Wallner was on deck. The hometown kid could have had a chance for the big Grand Slam. Then, maybe, his suburbanite people would finally love him as a human who deserves love. But, suburbanites, so probably not even then.</p>\n<p>“I hit the game-winning grand slam.”</p>\n<p>“Great. We’re still so proud of you for only disappointing us in everything up until this moment in a meaningless game.”</p>\n<p>9: Pagán’s fine for his second straight inning, following his season style of doing fine when it doesn’t matter.</p>\n<p>Jermaine Palacios may some day be a fine MLB player. That day has not arrived. 0-4 with 3 Ks. Let’s all hope he gets much better next year. Twims lomse.</p>\n<p>No duds or studs (beating these Twins is not an impressive feat), but special mention to Cave for being somewhat competitive the last few games when every other veteran Twin can’t wait for the offseason to start. (Not a slam on those veterans, either, I and many other Twins fans feel the same way.)</p>\n<p>COTG goes to sandwiches for “What a sexy sliding catch by Wallner” and artistformerlyknownasGoose responding “I promise not to kink shame.” Thanks to SooFoo and Joel, too, I’d have been so bored without you folks.</p>\n\n<p>(If you’re on Apple News, that clip is removed, and here’s a link to it: https://www.mlb.com/video/trevor-megill-in-play-out-s-to-max-stassi. But I’ve never been featured on Apple News and I don’t think this recap will change that streak.)</p>\n<p>Tune in tommorrow at 6:10 if you want to catch Joe Ryan going for the Twins rookie strikeout record... although I don’t know what that record is. It was just something radio said.</p>",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/falvey-twins-to-retain-manager-rocco-baldelli.html",
        "description": "<p>The Twins have floundered down the stretch, losing 15 of 21 games this month to fall to 73-77 entering play Friday. They’ll need a strong finish to avoid a second straight losing season, which is certainly a disappointing outcome for a team that was 11 games over .500 in May and sat at the top of the AL Central as recently as three weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Despite the team’s abysmal final month, Minnesota chief baseball officer Derek Falvey made clear the club had no plans to make a change atop the dugout. Speaking with reporters this afternoon, Falvey stated that the possibility of replacing skipper Rocco Baldelli “never even crossed my mind” (relayed by Do-Hyoung Park of MLB.com and Aaron Gleeman of the Athletic). “Rocco’s our manager. He’s my partner in this all the way through,” the Twins baseball operations leader said. “Rocco’s a big part of our future. Not just next year, but beyond.”</p>\n<p>Baldelli has occupied the manager’s office at Target Field for four seasons. First hired over the 2018-19 offseason, the former MLB outfielder reportedly received a four-year guarantee that came with multiple options. It isn’t clear whether the club plans to simply exercise a 2023 option in his existing deal or renegotiate a new contract, but Baldelli’s in position to lead the charge for a fifth season either way.</p>\n<p>While the past two seasons have been underwhelming, Baldelli led the team to AL Central titles in each of his first two years at the helm. Minnesota’s 2019 team set the all-time record for home runs in a season en route to 101 wins, although they were promptly swept by the Yankees in an AL Division Series. The Twins went 36-24 during the abbreviated 2020 schedule but again were swept in the first playoff round — this time at the hands of the Astros. Minnesota entered 2021 as at least co-favorites with the White Sox to take the division again, but they posted a 73-89 season that dropped them into last place.</p>\n<p>On the heels of that awful 2021 campaign, the Twins reloaded with an aggressive offseason. Minnesota stunningly signed Carlos Correa to an opt-out laden three-year deal in Spring Training that featured the highest average annual value ($35.1MM) for any free agent position player in history. The Twins also acquired Sonny Gray and Chris Paddack in March trades while adding Chris Archer and Dylan Bundy to the back of the rotation via free agency. The aggressiveness looked as if it’d paid off early on, with Minnesota seizing an early division lead. They doubled down at this summer’s trade deadline, bringing in Jorge López and Tyler Mahle.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the organization, the roster overhaul wasn’t enough to overcome a brutal stretch of late-season injuries. Minnesota has been without Byron Buxton for a month (and announced this evening he’d undergo season-ending knee surgery). Jorge Polanco has missed nearly as much time, as has Mahle. Left fielder Trevor Larnach and catcher Ryan Jeffers have been out for multiple months. Gray has been on and off the injured list twice this year, while Minnesota lost Paddack to Tommy John surgery and was without mid-rotation starter Bailey Ober between May and mid-September. Former top prospects Royce Lewis and Alex Kirilloff again lost much of their seasons to injury.</p>\n<p>That’s certainly not to say all the Twins’ struggles are attributable to poor health luck. Minnesota entered the season with a rotation reliant on Paddack, Bundy and Archer — all of whom had serious injury and/or performance concerns in the recent past. The bullpen has blown 26 leads, tied for sixth-most in the majors. While the club has hit well overall, they’ve underperformed with runners in scoring position. That’s presumably not a trend they anticipate continuing over multiple seasons, but it has contributed to the team ranking 17th in runs scored despite being 12th in on-base percentage and 11th in slugging.</p>\n<p>Minnesota figures to be in for another active offseason as they look to get back on track. Correa is likely to opt out of his contract in search of a longer-term deal. If he departs, as many anticipate he will, the Twins would have to decide how to proceed at shortstop. They’ll also need to overhaul the bullpen and could look into upgrades in the corner outfield and at the back of the rotation. Besides Correa, the club will see Gary Sánchez, Michael Fulmer and Archer hit free agency and is likely to buy out options on Bundy and Miguel Sanó.</p>",

Instead, you will get a four-game losing streak, and you will like it!</p>\n\nThe Starters\n<p>Lucas Giolito got the start tonight against Detroit, struggling right out of the gate, giving up two runs on two hits in the first before Jonathon Schoop took him deep a couple of innings later.

Not bad at all! Gio ended up having a decent start, walking one batter, and striking out nine.

        "description": "Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Could have done without the drama in the ninth inning</p> <p>The Cleveland Guardians erased a 2-0 deficit Friday night, riding a five-run outburst in the sixth inning to beat the Texas Rangers, 6-3, and notch their fifth consecutive win.</p>\n<p>The Guardians broke the game open in the sixth inning, trailing 2-1 as the Rangers turned the game over to their bullpen with Taylor Hearn on the mound in relief of starting pitcher Jon Gray. With one out and runners at the corners, Josh Naylor drilled an RBI double to the wall in right-center to tie the game. Oscar Gonzalez then muscled an RBI single into center field to plate the go-ahead run. The floodgates opened from there thanks to an RBI single by Andres Gimenez and a two-run single courtesy of Will Brennan, effectively turning a 2-1 deficit into a 6-2 lead.</p>\n<p>Gray had stymied the Guardians’ lineup through the first five frames, only giving up a hit, a walk, and an unearned run. That run came in the fourth inning after a leadoff triple by Amed Rosario. After getting Jose Ramirez to fly out to left field, Gray walked Naylor, who then stole second base, giving Rosario the opportunity to score when the throw down was off the mark.</p>\n<p>On the mound for Cleveland, Cody Morris was workmanlike through five innings. The inning that got away from him was the second, which was saw him walk Adolis Garcia and Leody Taveras with one out. Morris nearly escaped, but Kevin Plawecki singled to center field with two outs.</p>\n<p>Straw threw home to try and cut down Garcia but the throw was wide of home plate. To make matters worse, Luke Maile didn’t appear to make much of an effort to stop the ball and it went to the backstop. Inexplicably, Morris had planted himself on the first base side of home plate, as if the throw would be coming from left field. So he was nowhere near the ball as it blew past Maile, allowing Taveras to score easily to give the Rangers an early 2-0 lead.</p>\n<p>The only other run scored by the Rangers was allowed by Eli Morgan in the sixth inning, though Emmanuel Clase had an eventful ninth inning in the process of closing out the game. He allowed a two-out opposite field single to Corey Seager before Nathaniel Lowe split Rosario and Gimenez with a single up the middle. Clase then hit Garcia in the wrist with a pitch to load the bases, but thankfully Josh Jung grounded into a fielder’s choice to end the game.</p>\n<p>With the Guardians’ win and the White Sox losing to the Tigers, the magic number drops to three.</p>",

Henderson/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Nine runs, thirteen hits, no problem. </p> <p>The Mets were gifted an off-day loss by the Braves yesterday, and with the Braves losing again today, it was imperative that the Mets take advantage of this situation. And take advantage they did, as the Mets walloped the Athletics 9-1 in Oakland this evening. </p>\n<p>Cole Irvin started for the A’s, and kept the Mets off the board for the first inning. But in the second, the Mets got on the board with a bloop single by Mark Vientos with the bases loaded, scoring Pete Alonso from third. Two batters later, Brandon Nimmo (who told us he wasn’t really hurt, despite out fears, but what do we know?) drove in two more runs, giving the Mets a three run lead, which would be more than they’d need to put away Oakland.</p>\n<p>However, they didn’t stop there. In the fifth inning, Eduardo Escobar socked a grand slam just over the left-field wall to put the Mets up 7-0. A Jeff McNeil single and a Vientos double made it 8-0 before Irvin was relieved of his duties. </p>\n<p>The Mets would add one more run in the seventh when McNeil drove in a run with an RBI double. </p>\n<p>Former Athletic Chris Bassitt started for the Mets, and gave up just two runs over eight innings worked. A Sean Murphy double and a Seth Brown single drove in the first run for the A’s in the seventh, and a towering solo home run by Dermis Garcia added the second, and final, run. Bassitt struck out two, giving up six hits and one walk over eight, making it look easy at times. Drew Smith pitched in his second game off the IL, tossing a scoreless ninth inning. </p>\n<p>Collin Wiles put in a yeoman’s effort tonight in relief for the Athletics, going four and a third innings, giving up just one run and saving his bullpen brethren in the process. </p>\n<p>With this victory, the Mets now hold a 2.5 game lead over the Braves, and with Jacob deGrom going against Ken Waldichuk tomorrow, the team hopes to continue to build its lead in the National League East. </p>\nSB Nation GameThreads\n<p>Amazin’ Avenue</p>\n<p>Athletics Nation</p>\nBox scores\n<p>ESPN</p>\n<p>MLB.com</p>\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs.com\n      Mets vs Athletics WPA Chart, 9/24/22\n  \n<p>What’s WPA?</p>\n<p>Big winner: Chris Bassitt, +18.1% WPA</p>\n<p>Big loser: None!</p>\n<p>Total pitcher WPA: +18.2% WPA</p>\n<p>Total batter WPA: +31.8% WPA</p>\n<p>Teh aw3s0mest play: Brandon Nimmo’s 2-run single, +16.2% WPA</p>\n<p>Teh sux0rest play: Sean Murphy’s first inning single, -1.2% WPA</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Mitchell Layton/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The Orioles handed another loss to the Astros, this time 6-0.</p> <p>The Oriole Park at Camden Yards is turning into a nightmare place for the Astros. On Friday night, they were shut out for the second consecutive game, something that has happened only six times in the last 10 years. This time, Houston lost 6-0 and was limited to only four hits by opponent starter Dean Kremer, who went the distance for the first time in his career.</p>\n<p>Kremer absolutely outpitched José Urquidy. The latter, whose record is now at 13-8, allowed three hits and one earned run over 5 1/3 innings but it was actually Kremer’s night. The 26-year-old righty threw 70 of his 106 pitches for strikes and surrendered only four hits (three singles) while giving up two walks and striking out six hitters.</p>\n<p>The Astros, who registered two hits on Thursday’s scoreless loss, had José Altuve as the only hitter to record two basehits (2-for-4, with a double). Yordan Álvarez and Chas McCormick were the other two with a knock. Álvarez reached base thrice, thanks also to drawing two walks.</p>\n<p>According to Stathead, this is only the third time since 2012 that the Astros have gone scoreless in a two-game span and have registered six or fewer hits combined. That also happened back in 2013 (vs Rays) and 2021 (vs Yankees).</p>\n<p>Urquidy and Kremer found themselves in a beautiful pitcher’s duel with a scoreless scoreboard until the fourth, when the Astros starter gave up a solo shot to youngster Adley Rutschman. The game remained 1-0 until the bottom of the seventh inning, when they hit three run-scoring singles and an RBI double to make it 6-0.</p>\n<p>The Astros, looking for their 100th win of the year (99), still have a chance not to lose the four-game series. On Saturday, both teams will play the third one. Framber Valdez will try to keep going his historic streak of quality starts while rookie Mike Baumann is announced to make his second career start in the Majors.</p>\n<p>VIDEOS AND BOX SCORE HERE.</p>",

        "description": "John Leyba-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Alan Trejo’s game-winner made sure Ezequiel Tovar’s impressive debut ended on a high note</p> <p>Ezequiel Tovar was very impressive in his MLB debut, and Colorado’s pitching staff was able to keep San Diego’s lineup at bay for most of Friday’s contest. It seemed they may be in danger of a late loss, but Alan Trejo was the extra-innings hero and made sure Rockies fans would celebrate Fireworks Night with a win.</p>\nDon’t leave me hangin...\n<p>The Rockies seemed to have a good sense for Sean Manaea’s pitches as they put ball after ball into play early on. For instance, the bottom of the first inning started with the promise of a quick lead as singles by Yonathan Daza and Randal Grichuk preceded Elehuris Montero’s walk, loading the bases with no outs yet recorded. Unfortunately, Elías Díaz flew out to shallow right field and Michael Toglia ground into a double play to end the threat. </p>\n<p>It was much the same in the second. Sean Bouchard came up with two on and one out, but he flew out and Daza grounded out to keep Colorado off the board again. </p>\n<p>San Diego would therefore take advantage, scoring two runs in the top of the third inning by way of an run-scoring groundout by Juan Soto and RBI single from Manny Machado (of course it was those two) to take a 2-0 lead. </p>\nGrichuk gets the Rox going\n<p>That 2-0 lead wouldn’t last long. In the bottom half of the third, Randal Grichuk took Manaea’s first pitch and cranked it out to left field for his 16th home run of the season. </p>\n\n\n<p>Going. Gone. Grichuk. pic.twitter.com/Wy79df7FmA</p>— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The blast got Colorado on the board and seemed to give the home team’s offense a shot in the arm as they finally broke through in the fourth frame. </p>\n#tovartime\n<p>Ezequiel Tovar... there probably isn’t anyone reading this article that doesn’t know that name by now. Friday night was his chance to finally shine on the big stage, and he wasted no time making an impact. </p>\n<p>His first at-bat came in the bottom of the second, where he took the very first pitch he saw back up the middle for his first MLB hit.</p>\n\n\n<p>✅First at-bat<br />✅First pitch<br />✅First Major League hit<br /><br />Congrats, Ezequiel Tovar‼️ pic.twitter.com/cYRzjWh7Rv</p>— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Then, with two outs in the bottom of the fourth, he struck again - also on the very first pitch. That’s right, two pitches for two hits. No other Rockie has done that to start their career...ever.</p>\n<p>After Tovar’s second knock, Sean Bouchard walked to once again put men on for Daza once again. He would not be denied again as he laced a triple into center field, scoring two runs and giving Colorado a 3-2 lead. </p>\n\n\n<p>The @Rockies take a 3-2 lead on a @Yonathandaza_ triple in the 4th. Tovar tallies his first big league run. pic.twitter.com/RWWJ4MqASH</p>— AT&amp;T SportsNet™ | RM (@ATTSportsNetRM) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>With the momentum firmly in their grasp, Colorado’s pitching staff would need to shut down San Diego for the rest of the game to send the crowd home happy.</p>\nSoto is explosive\n<p>Ryan Feltner did a solid job in his start, limiting the damage after that third inning and throwing five total innings of two-run ball on five hits and a walk while striking out three. Jake Bird then entered and threw two excellent innings, allowing no base runners as the Padres went down in order. Things were going swimmingly.</p>\n<p>That was, until the top of the eighth. Carlos Estévez entered the game and recorded a quick fly out before facing Soto. The star outfielder showed why he’s considered one of the faces of the game as he cranked a high fastball deep to center field, tying things at 3 apiece. Soto’s 26th of the season reset the contest as we headed into the late innings. </p>\nTrejo’s tenth inning tally\n<p>After Daniel Bard pitched two scoreless innings of relief in the ninth and tenth frames, the Rockies had a chance to finish things in the bottom half. Garrett Hampson started at second base and was itching to run as he saw Charlie Blackmon take first base on an intentional walk. That meant that it fell to Alan Trejo, with two on base and one out, to win the game for the home crowd. With the count 1-0, reliever Adrian Morejon delivered his pitch, and fireworks followed.</p>\n\n\n<p>Baseball is FUN  pic.twitter.com/NzMkHSCHFM</p>— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\nUp Next\n<p>The Rockies and Padres run it back with their second game tomorrow. San Diego’s Yu Darvish (15-7, 3.05 ERA) will duke it out with Colorado’s Chad Kuhl (6-9, 5.48 ERA) as the Rockies try to play spoiler to the Padres playoff aspirations.</p>\n<p>First pitch is at 6:10pm MDT. See you then!</p>\n<p>Also, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the incredible achievement that Albert Pujols reached this evening. 700 home runs is a mark that few have ever reached, and in all likelihood no one ever will again. Congratulations to the living legend Albert Pujols!</p>",

        "description": "<p>Even if Friday’s game didn’t have much bearing on the Rockies’ lost season, it mattered to the Padres, which meant it mattered to manager Bud Black.</p>\n<p>Before the Rockies spoiled the Padres’ evening with a gripping 4-3 walk-off win in the 10th, when Alan Trejo singled home Garrett Hampson to seize the victory, Black talked to his players about maintaining the “integrity” of the season, whether they were in the playoff picture or not. The Padres, still jostling with the Phillies and Brewers in the Wild Card race, needed Friday’s game to maintain their slight cushion.</p>\n<p>“We talked about that,” Black reiterated after the win. “… The league is watching, and these guys were aware of that.”</p>\n<p>The Rockies handed the Padres nothing. Not in front of a raucous, sold-out crowd at Coors Field that was begging its team to snap their four-game losing streak. If you hadn’t seen the rest of their underwhelming season, for one night, you might’ve thought the Rockies were still making a playoff push in September like their opponent.</p>\n<p>“(Black) wants us to get ready for those kind of situations, to get ready to play teams like this,” Trejo said.</p>\n<p>Yes, they were still the Rockies, leaving guys stranded in scoring position in aggravating fashion, but there were also fundamentally sound plays, quality defense and solid pitching. Now 65-86 on the season, those pillars weren’t always a given.</p>\n<p>But on a perfect Friday night, the Rockies got the win. In the scorebooks, it went to closer Daniel Bard. Starter Ryan Feltner gave Colorado five quality innings in the start.</p>\n<p>Not only did the Rockies hold up their end of the bargain, but the start of their three-game series against the Padres also marked the much anticipated MLB debut of shortstop Ezequiel Tovar, one of the highest-rated prospects in Colorado’s farm system. In Tovar, Black said he noticed a unique comfort in his abilities. That he got to play in a competitive, meaningful environment was an added bonus.</p>\n<p>Tovar, as Black advertised, flashed his trademark confidence early. When he came up in the second inning for his first at-bat, he jumped on the first pitch he saw and lashed a single to center. In the fourth, he saw one more pitch and whipped another single to left. He advanced to second when the next batter walked, and cruised home when Yonathan Daza laced a triple off the wall to plate two and give the Rockies a 3-2 lead.</p>\n<p>Speaking through a translator, Tovar said he never imagined his debut would’ve been as dramatic as it was.</p>\n<p>Padres starter Sean Manaea was ousted after Daza’s timely knock, and Colorado’s lead held until the eighth inning, when newly acquired slugger Juan Soto blasted a solo homerun 440 feet to center.</p>",

        "description": "Lucas Giolito goes six innings, but once again the Chicago offense couldn’t get it done. | Matt Marton-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Nothing seems to be left in the tank, White Sox drop opener to Tigers, 5-3</p> <p>After being swept by the Cleveland Guardians, the last two weeks of baseball on the South Side have little to no meaning. The White Sox seemed to take this to heart tonight, as they extended their losing streak to four games by dropping the first of a three-game set to Detroit, 5-3.</p>\n<p>Lucas Giolito took the mound for the first time in seven days. He faced a similar lineup last week at Comerica Park, and his outing started out looking eerily similar. It took Gio 28 pitches to get through the first inning, which resulted in two runs for the Tigers. </p>\n<p>Those runs were obtained after Lucas ran an 0-2 count full to leadoff batter Riley Greene, then walked him. Javy Báez continued to rake against Giolito, ripping a double to right field to put runners on second and third with nobody out. This set Miguel Cabrera up to ground out to score Greene. Baez scored the second run on a single from Eric Haase. </p>\n<p>Johnathon Schoop wasted no time in the top of the second inning and hit a first-pitch solo home run into the left-field bullpen. The White Sox were in a 3-0 hole early. </p>\n<p>Detroit had no problem getting traffic on the bases early, but it took the South Siders a couple of innings to get the car warmed up. Adam Engel and Elvis Andrus knocked a pair of singles in the third to get things going, and José Abreu came through with yet another two-out single to score Engel. AJ Pollock had a shot to get more with the bases loaded and two outs, but, alas, he grounded out to end the ally.</p>\n<p>Andrew Vaughn has not had a great season in the outfield, but the lifelong first baseman would get his time to shine in the top of the fifth, robbing Baez of his 15th home run of the year with a grab off the top of the right-field wall. Instead, Lucas Giolito would tip his hat to Vaughn in thanks for helping his ERA.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><br />AJ Pollock made up for his ground out in the third inning by tying the game up in the bottom of the sixth. The line drive over the right-center fence would give AJ his 14th of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><br />Lucas Giolito’s night was done after 90 pitches. He gave up three runs, walked one, and stuck out nine in his six innings of work. </p>\n<p>The last two runs for Detroit were painful to watch. Akil Baddoo started the seventh with a single off of Reynaldo López. Yasmani Grandal made a throwing error while trying to catch Baddoo stealing second, and the ball deposited into center field pushed the runner to third. Baddoo would later score the go-ahead and eventual winning run on a sacrifice fly.</p>\n<p>The last run of the night for the Tigers came after Jimmy Lambert walked Cabrera to lead off the eighth inning. Willi Castro came in to pinch-run. Detroit took advantage of the White Sox green light for running games, as Castro stole second and got to third on a wild pitch by Lambert. Castro would score on a ground-rule double by Spencer Torkelson.</p>\n<p>The White Sox would load the bases in the bottom of the eighth but would fail to capitalize. Like a balloon with no air, the White Sox are deflated. </p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "Tennessee Smokies\n    \n\n  <p>The Smokies stun the Trash Pandas to advance to the title series. Iowa gets taken down by Omaha.</p> <p>Some pretty awesome news down in Alabama tonight. </p>\n<p>Tennessee Smokies</p>\n<p>The Tennessee Smokies trashed the Rocket City Trash Pandas (Angels), 3-1. The win clinched the Southern League North Division playoff, two games to one.</p>\n<p>Just like the South Bend Cubs in their title series, the Smokies lost game one at home and then came back to win games two and three on the road. </p>\n<p>The Smokies handed the ball to right-hander Chris Clarke for this deciding game three. Neither team scored before Smokies catcher Harrison Wenson hit a solo home run off of Trash Pandas starter Mason Erla in the top of the third inning.</p>\n<p>But Clarke gave the run back in the bottom of that inning. After a leadoff single and a fielder’s choice, Clarke loaded the bases with another single and a hit batsman. Next, with one out, Clarke walked in a run when Preston Palmeiro worked him for an RBI eight-pitch walk.</p>\n<p>But Clarke dug in after that and got Logan O’Hoppe to pop out and Aaron Whitefield to fly to right. That lost opportunity in the third inning was the only one the Trash Pandas would get tonight. Rocket City never got a runner past second base after the third inning.</p>\n<p>The Smokies retook the lead in the fifth. Wenson led off the inning with a walk. After an error on a sacrifice bunt put runners on first and second, third baseman Jake Slaughter singled home Wenson to make it 2-1. The Smokies had a chance for more after Nelson Maldonado walked to load the bases with two outs, but Cole Roederer struck out to end the rally.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Wenson tormented the organization that released him. In the eighth inning, he tacked on an insurance run with a solo homer, his second of the night. Wenson had hit five home runs all summer before tonight. </p>\n<p>The Smokies bullpen struggled badly down the stretch, but they came up big in this playoff series. After Clarke left after six innings, Samuel Reyes went the rest of the way for a three-inning save. Reyes gave up two hits, but no runs. He struck out five, walked one and hit one batter.</p>\n<p>In his winning effort, Clarke allowed one run on five hits over six innings. Clarke struck out seven and walked one. He also hit one batter.</p>\n<p>Wenson scored all three Smokies runs tonight. He went 2 for 3 with a walk and the two home runs. He also threw out the only runner trying to steal. </p>\n<p>Slaughter was 3 for 5 with the RBI single. He also stole a base. </p>\n<p>The Smokies only had seven hits tonight and went 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position. But the two solo home runs and the excellent pitching were enough.</p>\n<p>Here’s Wenson’s 2nd home run.</p>\n\n\n<p>Harrison Wenson puts Tennessee on his shoulders. 2nd HR on a 101mph FB! pic.twitter.com/f6rAX0JeOy</p>— Itsacon (@thats_so_cub) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the celebration at the end of the game.</p>\n\n\n<p>.@smokiesbaseball is headed to the Southern League Finals for the first time since 2011!@Cubs prospect Harrison Wenson leaves the yard twice in the decisive Game 3. pic.twitter.com/bCGxpEnU7u</p>— Minor League Baseball (@MiLB) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The Smokies move on to the Southern League Championship Series, where they will take on the Pensacola Blue Wahoos, a Marlins affiliate. Game one is in Pensacola on Sunday, September 25. Games two and three (if necessary) will take place at Smokies Stadium on Tuesday and Wednesday. </p>\n<p>The Tennessee franchise is shooting for their first outright Southern League title since 1978 when they were the Knoxville Sox. If you want to know how long ago that was, their manager that year was Tony La Russa. It’s the second-longest title drought in Minor League Baseball. (The Syracuse Mets have not won an outright title since 1976.) The Smokies were named co-champions of the Southern League in 2004 after Hurricane Ivan canceled that year’s title series, but they have not won an individual title since 1978. </p>\n<p>Iowa Cubs</p>\n<p>The Iowa Cubs had the heavens open up on them by the Omaha Storm Chasers (Royals), 10-2.</p>\n<p>Starter Caleb Kilian still seems to have control issues, which was a big reason he got the loss tonight. Kilian allowed four runs on four hits over 4.1 innings. He struck out four, but he walked five. Only 42 of his 88 pitches were strikes.</p>\n<p>In his second-straight rehab appearance, Steven Brault failed to retire a batter. Brault allowed four runs on three hits and a walk. One of those hits was a home run.</p>\n<p>Second baseman Christian Donahue hit a solo home run in the fourth inning, his first of the season. Donahue was 1 for 4.</p>\n<p>Shortstop Scott McKeon went 2 for 4. He scored a run with two outs in the top of the ninth to see that the I-Cubs only lost by eight instead of nine.</p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "We were here to \"Make friends, not art!\"  Well, that sounds fun. But what if your friends' art sucks? Documenta was always a pacesetter — and this year's edition certainly put its finger on a larger shift, seen too in our museums, our art schools and our magazines, away from aesthetic ambition and intellectual seriousness and toward the easier comforts of togetherness, advocacy and fun. If your friends' art sucks, that's actually no big deal — because being together matters more than doing something well. And if the German press say your friends' art sucks, that's OK, too — reassuring, actually, as evidence that this rotten colonizers' world has no place for us.<br /><br /> Twice a decade, for exactly 100 days, the world of culture turns its eyes to this midsize German city for Documenta, a giant exhibition whose intellectual ambitions and hefty budgets have ensured its reputation as the world's most prestigious show of contemporary art. This year's edition got off to a dreadful start in June, when its most prominent artwork, an agitprop mural incorporating unmistakable antisemitic caricatures, had to be withdrawn amid national outcry. The 15th Documenta now comes to a close on Sunday — not before another controversy that has seen artists, scholars and politicians trade accusations of antisemitism and racism, harassment and incompetence.<br />\n<br />\nnon-paywall link",

        "description": "LOS ANGELES, CA - SEPTEMBER 23: St. Louis Cardinals designated hitter Albert Pujols (5) gives former MLB player Adrian Beltre a high five after his career home run number 700 as a three run home run in the 4th inning of the MLB game between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 23, 2022 at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, CA. | Photo by Brian Rothmuller/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Pujols hit No. 699 off Andrew Heaney, then No. 700 off Phil Bickford</p> <p>Albert Pujols has long had a spot secured in the pantheon of all-time great baseball players, but on Friday he showed he still has plenty left in the tank. Pujols smashed two home runs to become the fourth member of the 700-homer club, keying the Cardinals’ 11-0 rout of the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium.</p>\n<p>Before the game, Pujols and fellow Cardinals retiree Yadier Molina were presented golf clubs from the Dodgers in a pregame ceremony. Pujols addressed the crowd over the public address system.</p>\n<p>“You guys brought me the joy,” Pujols said of his time with the Dodgers in 2021. “As a boy at five years old when I started playing baseball came back to me last year in that five and a half months I spent with a great organization.”</p>\n<p>That joy has continued and then some this season in his farewell tour with the Cardinals, for whom he played his first 11 seasons. He’s hitting .265/.338/.530 this year, with a 143 wRC+ and 21 home runs at age 42, in his 22nd and final season.</p>\n<p>Andrew Heaney, the Dodgers’ most homer-prone starting pitcher, started this game, and struck out Pujols in the first inning. But in the third inning, after a one-out walk to Tommy Edman, Pujols hit a ball well up the pavilion in left field for home run No. 699.</p>\n<p>Edman singled with two outs in the fourth ended Heaney’s night at 86 pitches to get only 11 outs. Dave Roberts wasn’t about to let Pujols face the left-handed Heaney again. So instead he brought in the right-handed Phil Bickford, the team’s most homer-prone reliever.</p>\n<p>On a 1-1 slider, Pujols made history.</p>\n\n\n<p>7️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ #Pujols700 pic.twitter.com/XyddSFPpcQ</p>— MLB (@MLB) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Pujols joins select company with his 700 only home runs, joining Barry Bonds (762 home runs), Henry Aaron (755), and Babe Ruth (714). Pujols, from the Dominican Republic, is the first member of the 700 club born outside the United States. Pujols and Aaron are the only players in MLB history with both 700 home runs and 3,000 hits.</p>\n<p>It was a magical moment for baseball, one completed by Pujols making a beeline after touching home to give a high-five through netting to Adrían Beltré, who was sitting in the first row.</p>\n<p>But in the game, Pujols’ second homer was a three-run shot that gave St. Louis a 5-0 lead. Three more runs off Bickford in the fifth, including a home run by Lars Nootbaar blew the game open. Bickford has allowed 12 home runs in 61 innings, tied for eighth-most allowed in relief by a Dodgers pitcher in one season.</p>\n<p>One loss doesn’t affect much in terms of the Dodgers’ playoff standing, nor their chances of home field advantage through the NLCS and World Series. But Friday night did do a good job of highlighting that the Dodgers still have a lot to sort out at the bottom third or so of any potential postseason roster.</p>\n<p>Heaney has allowed 13 home runs in 64⅔ innings this season. He also has a 3.06 ERA and a 35-percent strikeout rate, but over his last seven starts the ERA is 4.82 with 11 home runs. Couple that with Dustin May’s shakiness and Tony Gonsolin’s forearm strain, and the Dodgers’ options for a fourth starter in October aren’t all that attractive at the moment.</p>\n<p>Craig Kimbrel, demoted from the closer role earlier Friday, saw his first appearance come in the lowest of leverage, down eight runs in the sixth. He pitched a 1-2-3 inning.</p>\n<p>Hanser Alberto, who started at second base Friday, made his ninth pitching appearance of the season, and pitched the final two innings. He allowed a home run to rookie Alec Burleson, who pinch-hit for Pujols in the eighth.</p>\n<p>Five home runs hit by the Cardinals were one shy of the Dodgers’ record for most given up at Dodger Stadium. The Reds hit six home runs on August 2, 2001, and Arizona hit six (four by JD Martinez) on September 4, 2017.</p>\nFriday particulars\n<p>Home runs: Albert Pujols 2 (21), Lars Nootbaar (14), Juan Yepez (12), Alec Burleson (1)</p>\n<p>WP — José Quintana (6-6): 6⅔ IP, 5 hits, 6 strikeouts</p>\n<p>LP — Andrew Heaney (3-3): 3⅔ IP, 4 hits, 4 runs, 2 walks, 5 strikeouts</p>\nUp next\n<p>Clayton Kershaw is on the mound on Saturday night (6:10 p.m., SportsNet LA), with the first of either two or three regular season starts remaining. Kershaw is 25th all-time with 2,787 strikeouts, and the next slot ahead of him is Cy Young with 2,803. Fellow southpaw Jordan Montgomery, with a 2.35 ERA in nine starts since getting acquired from the Yankees at the trade deadline, starts for St. Louis.</p>",

        "description": "Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>We now join your Dbacks game, already in progress...<br /><br />The score is 0-0 going to the top of the second inning. Neither team had a hit in the first inning it seems, so nothing was missed.<br /><br />Second inning</p>\n<p><br />With two outs, Brandon Crawford is batting. He hits a home run to RF, 1-0 San Francisco. David Villar now batting for the Giants, and he will strike out. </p>\n<p><br />Christian Walker to lead things off, 2-2 fouls off what would have been ball 3 high, full count, another foul, takes strike 3 but is unhappy about it. I was on another tab so I didnt see it. Carson Kelly pops up to 1B. Luplow tries his best, but the pitcher works the count full, he walked. I may have just seen a pig flying past my window. Sergio Alcantara now, he  will strikeout on 8 pitches.<br /><br />Third inning<br /><br />Austin Wynns homers on the first offering from Henry. Their Luis Gonzalez singles to Ketel, couldnt find a handle on it so didnt try a throw. Slater grounded into a 4-6-3 double play. Flores walked. Yas strikes out swinging to end it.<br /><br />Our Gonzo played over 500 games in LF at Chase, this is theirs’ first game out there. <br /><br />Carroll will pop up to Crawford by the 3B bag. Perdomo full count gets called out on strikes on a pitch up and away. It was not in the strike zone. Perdomo couldnt believe it. #roboumpsnow 3-1  to Marte he walks on a pitch that was in the same spot. Stone Garrett hits a HR to the triangle in LF-CF and we are tied! Rivera will fly out to CF to end it. <br /><br />Fourth inning<br /><br />Longoria singles past Perdomo. Bit of a weird play, JD Davis hits one in front of Luplow, but Longoria couldnt advance because he had to see if it would be caught thus getting thrown out, 9-4. Crawford struck out. David Villar hits a 2 run shot, the 3rd homer allowed by Tommy Henry today. 4-2 Giants. Wynns walked and then Gonzo pops up to Perdomo for the final out. <br /><br />Made a microwave pizza. With 2 out, Luplow walked. I am sure he is disappointed he didnt make the final out. Alcantara on a full count singles past a diving Davis at 1B. Runners on the corners. Carroll strikes out on 3 pitches.<br /><br />Fifth inning<br /><br />Slater struck out. Flores walks on a full count. Yas bunts it to 3B, but gets thrown out. Goes as a sacrifice, but that was a bunt base hit attempt. Henry at 80 pitches and Widener is throwing in our pen. Longoria singles to RF, Stone’s throw home is offline and it is 5-2 SF. Torrey comes out and Henry’s night is done. Widener is on. Davis flies out to Carroll. <br /><br />Perdomo leads things off with a single to LF.  Marte pops it up to 2B. Stone Garrett doubles, Perdomo to 3B. Junior Marte on to pitch for the Giants. Rivera dumps one to RF, Yas dives for it and cant come up with it. Both runners score and Rivera to 2B. Walker walked. Carson Kelly strikes out on a full count. Luplow singles to RF, Rivera scores and Walker to 3B. We are tied at 5. Alcantara flies out to CF to end it<br /><br />Sixth inning<br /><br />Crawford GO 6-3. Villar will strike out. Wynns with a groundball up the middle, but Marte cant throw him out. Joc Pederson will pinch hit for their Gonzo, he struck out. <br /><br />Shell-me Miller on for the Giants. Carroll flies out to CF. Perdomo singled. Marte stuck out. Varsho pinch hit for Garrett, he strikes out.<br /><br />Seventh inning<br /><br />Luis Frias on for the Dbacks. Wade walked. Yas flies out to Carroll. Longoria singles to shallow CF. Davis walks on a full count, and the Giants have the bases loaded with 2 out. Crawford strikes out and Frias is pumped up.<br /><br />Shell-me still out there. Pavin Smith pinch hits for Rivera, and he singles. Pavin’s first appearance for the Dbacks since June 28. Walker and Kelly both struck out. Luplow singled to LF. Alcantara strikes out. <br /><br />Eight inning<br /><br />Ginkel on to pitch for the Dbacks. Villar GO 6-3. Jason Vosler will pinch hit for Wynn.<br /><br />Getting ready for bed. Didnt miss anything. Shell-me still out there. Marte just doubled with 2 out. Alex Young comes in to pitch to Varsho.  Varsho lines out.<br /><br />Ninth inning<br /><br />Caleb Smith on to pitch. Wade popped up to 3B. Flores flies out to Luplow. Yas singles. Longoria grounds to 3B, and Alcantara throws it away. Runners on the corners, with 2 out for the Giants. JD Davis singles to LF. Yas scores, Longoria gets thrown out at a close play at home trying to score.<br /><br />Camilo Doval to pitch for the Giants. We will have Pavin, Kelly and Walker due up. Pavin grounds out to Crawford. Walker strikes out. Rojas pinch hits for Carson Kelly, who singles and we have something going with 2 out. Alek Thomas pinch hitting for Luplow, he grounds out to 1B to end it.  </p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>https://www.fangraphs.com/livewins.aspx?date=2022-09-23&amp;team=Diamondbacks&amp;dh=0&amp;season=2022<br /><br />Only one sedona red comment tonight, so COTN goes to kilborn.

        "description": "<p>From a difficult childhood to the absurdities of pop celebrity, the Lush singer’s story breaks the mould of music memoir</p><p>When Miki Berenyi was eight years old, her father, Ivan, would take her out on the town. At local nightclubs, he would buy her vodka and orange and the pair would hit the dancefloor. Soon it would be time for her to fulfil her main purpose, which was to act as bait for an “appropriately attractive woman”. Once Ivan had selected his target, his daughter would be dispatched to chat to her. A few minutes later, Ivan would apologetically retrieve her and engage the woman in conversation. “While I’m pleased to have been an accomplice – part of Dad’s dynamic duo – it’s a self-defeating skill because I am from that moment sidelined,” Berenyi recalls. “No longer the centre of Dad’s attention, I become bored and begin yawning, and he has the perfect excuse to usher his catch home.”</p><p>Music memoirs tend to race through their author’s childhoods to get to the meatier business of rock’n’roll stardom, but Fingers Crossed is not like most music memoirs. Fiercely honest and emotionally acute, it is evenly divided between Berenyi’s early life and her nine-year stint as the singer in British dream-pop outfit, Lush. While the band, who toured the world and enjoyed a handful of Top 40 singles in the 1980s and 90s, had their dissolute moments, they had nothing on Berenyi’s family life, which was characterised by extreme chaos and dysfunction.</p> Continue reading...",

The tarte tatin, meanwhile, is ideal at this time of the year, using seasonal pears, which, when cooked with the star anise caramel, absorb the warmth of the spice. Dark chocolate and hazelnuts add drama, as do lashings of fresh cream or ice-cream.</p><p>Recipes extracted from Chetna’s Easy Baking: With a Twist of Spice, published by Octopus at £20.

        "description": "<p>Today, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and Representative Elise Stefanik (R-NY), who took over as the chair of the House Republican Conference after the party rejected Representative Liz Cheney (R-WY) for her refusal to back the January 6 insurrection, released the House Republicans’ plan for the country. <br /><br />Covering just a single page, it presents vague aspirations—many of which Biden has already put in place—but focuses on the radical extremes of the MAGA party while trying to make those extremes sound mild. <br /><br />The so-called “Commitment to America” calls for a strong economy, a safe nation, a free future, and an accountable government. So far, so good.<br /><br />But the first topic—making the economy strong—is a paraphrase of what the Biden administration has been doing. The Republicans call for fighting inflation and lowering the cost of living, making America energy independent, bringing down gas prices, strengthening the supply chain, and ending the country’s dependence on China. <br /><br />This is quite literally the platform of the Democrats, but while the Republicans offer no actual proposals to contribute to these goals, Biden has taken concrete steps to address inflation by taking on the shipping monopolies that hiked transportation costs, for example, while Democrats in Congress have passed legislation capping the cost of certain prescription medications. Biden has released reserves to help combat high gas prices, which have now fallen close to their cost last March—a barrel of oil is now under $80—while expanding our nation’s pool of truck drivers and just last week averting a train strike that would have endangered supply chains. The incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act are designed specifically to make America energy independent while addressing climate change, and Biden’s extraordinary efforts to support economic development in the Indo-Pacific region, along with the CHIPS and Science Act, were explicitly designed to reduce U.S. dependence on China.<br /><br />It feels rather as if the Republicans recognize that Biden’s policies are popular, and are hoping that voters haven’t noticed that he is actually putting them in place. <br /><br />Then the document gets to the heart of its argument, recycling MAGA talking points in language that makes it very attractive. Who doesn’t want national safety, for example? <br /><br />But national safety is described here as securing the border and combatting illegal immigration (something already in place), adding 200,000 police officers through recruiting bonuses, cracking down on prosecutors and district attorneys who refuse to prosecute crimes (this is likely directed at those who say they will not prosecute women for obtaining abortions), criminalizing all fentanyl, and supporting our troops and exercising peace through strength (which likely means reversing Biden’s emphasis on multilateral diplomacy to return to using the U.S. military as a global enforcer)— all MAGA demands.<br /><br />“A Future That’s Built on Freedom” is a similar sleight of hand, meaning something far from the freedom of the recent past. Here it means giving parents control over their childrens’ education (more book banning and laws that prohibit teaching subjects that make students “uncomfortable”), “defend[ing] fairness by ensuring that only women can compete in women’s sports” (there’s the anti-trans statement), achieving “longer, healthier lives for Americans” by what appears to be getting rid of the Affordable Care Act, and what appears to be a defense of the use of ivermectin and other quack cures popular on the right (“lower prices through transparency, choice, and competition,” “invest in lifesaving cures,” and “improve access to telemedicine”). It also demands confronting “Big Tech” to make it fair, which is likely a reference to the right wing’s conviction that social media discriminates against it by banning hate speech. <br /><br />The section about accountable government calls for preserving constitutional freedoms, which they interpret as an apparent national ban on abortion—a constitutional right until this past June—saying they will “protect the lives of unborn children and their mothers.” They defend “religious freedom,” which the right wing, including the Supreme Court, has interpreted as freedom for Christian schools to receive public tax money and for Christian coaches to pray with students. The document also calls for safeguarding the Second Amendment, which the right wing has increasingly interpreted since the 1970s to mean that the government cannot regulate gun ownership. <br /><br />This section of the document calls for rigorous oversight of the government “to rein in government abuse of power and corruption,” providing “real transparency,” and requiring the White House “to answer for its incompetence at home and abroad.” It also says Republicans will “save and strengthen Social Security and Medicare.” <br /><br />While the part of this section that calls for stopping government abuse and incompetence seems rich coming from the MAGA Republicans, the statement that they intend to protect Social Security and Medicare strikes me as I felt when hearing Trump tell voters in 2020 that he would protect Obamacare at the very time his lawyers were in court trying to overturn the law. Now, in this moment, leading Republicans have vowed to get rid of Social Security and Medicare, which is an interesting way to “save and strengthen” them.<br /><br />Similarly, the section promising to “restore the people’s voice” calls for voting restrictions.<br /><br />In short, the document feels like the doublespeak from George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984. To defend the indefensible, Orwell wrote in an essay titled “Politics and the English Language,” “political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness…. The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns, as it were, instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish spurting out ink.” <br /><br />Former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA), who focused on the power of language to alter reality and who helped to write the 1994 Contract with America that enabled the Republicans to take control of the House for the first time since 1954, worked on this document. The Contract with America, which party leaders called a contract as a promise that it would be binding, led the Republicans to shut down the government for 28 days between November 1995 and January 1996 to get their way before they entirely abandoned the “contract.”<br /><br />To sell today’s document to voters, Republicans used a slick video, but Jennifer Bendery of HuffPost noted that the film uses stock videos from Russia and Ukraine in its “Commitment to America.” When Bendery reached out to McCarthy for comment, his spokesperson Mark Bednar responded: “Interesting how you guys aren’t remotely interested in the issues facing the American people in the video.” <br /><br />But will it work? The document tries to win Trump voters without actually mentioning Trump, who now alienates all but his fervent supporters. But he continues to dominate the Republican Party and to grab the headlines. Tonight, 60 Minutes teased a story that will broadcast on Sunday and is already raising eyebrows. In it, Denver Riggleman, former senior tech advisor for the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol, said that the White House switchboard connected a call to a rioter’s phone while the Capitol was under siege on January 6, 2021.</p><p>—</p><p>Notes:</p><p>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/house-republicans-commitment-to-america-stock-footage-russia-ukraine_n_632dc7afe4b0d12b5404bab1</p>60 Minutes @60MinutesThe White House switchboard connected a call to a rioter while the Capitol was under siege on January 6, 2021, according to former January 6 committee staffer Denver Riggleman.\n\n“I only know one end of that call,” Riggleman said.\ncbsn.ws/3BDxkop <p>September 23rd 2022</p>13,260 Retweets32,088 Likes<p>https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/gop-leaders-roll-out-commitment-to-america-midterm-election-agenda-but-challenges-remain</p>Ronald Klain @WHCOSOil has fallen below $80/barrel today.

At local nightclubs, he would buy her vodka and orange and the pair would hit the dancefloor. Soon it would be time for her to fulfil her main purpose, which was to act as bait for an “appropriately attractive woman”. Once Ivan had selected his target, his daughter would be dispatched to chat to her. A few minutes later, Ivan would apologetically retrieve her and engage the woman in conversation. “While I’m pleased to have been an accomplice – part of Dad’s dynamic duo – it’s a self-defeating skill because I am from that moment sidelined,” Berenyi recalls. “No longer the centre of Dad’s attention, I become bored and begin yawning, and he has the perfect excuse to usher his catch home.”</p><p>Music memoirs tend to race through their author’s childhoods to get to the meatier business of rock’n’roll stardom, but Fingers Crossed is not like most music memoirs. Fiercely honest and emotionally acute, it is evenly divided between Berenyi’s early life and her nine-year stint as the singer in British dream-pop outfit, Lush. While the band, who toured the world and enjoyed a handful of Top 40 singles in the 1980s and 90s, had their dissolute moments, they had nothing on Berenyi’s family life, which was characterised by extreme chaos and dysfunction.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Albert Cesare/The Enquirer / USA TODAY NETWORK\n    \n\n  <p>The Brewers gain a half game in the Wild Card standings.</p> <p>Box Score</p>\n<p>The Brewers continue to fight in the Wild Card race, with 12 games remaining in the season. They took care of business again on Friday night, using a balanced effort led by Andrew McCutchen for a 5-3 win over the Reds.</p>\n<p>The Reds took the lead early, as their first three batters all reached base, capped by a Kyle Farmer double for a 2-0 lead. From there, Eric Lauer continued to struggle, issuing two more outs before escaping the inning with the bases loaded. He needed 39 pitches to get out of the inning, though.</p>\n<p>The Brewers responded in the top of the second. Andrew McCutchen drew a one out walk and Luis Urias singled. Victor Caratini followed them with a double, driving them both in and tying the game at 2-2. Eric Lauer followed that with a scoreless second, needing 17 pitches to get out of the inning.</p>\n<p>The third went by scoreless, though it also was the end of Lauer’s day. He recorded two outs in the bottom of the third before Luis Perdomo entered in relief. Lauer finished with 66 pitches, two runs allowed, five hits, three walks, and three strikeouts. Perdomo provided some strong innings in relief for the Brewers, allowing just one hit in 3.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>While the bullpen kept the Reds offense in check, the Brewers were able to pull ahead. In the top of the fifth, Rowdy Tellez and Hunter Renfroe led off the inning with back-to-back singles, and Tellez moved up to third with Renfroe out on a Kolten Wong groundout. Andrew McCutchen then hit a ground ball to the right side of the infield with one out, and the Reds tried to turn the double play to end the inning but the throw to first was off. That allowed Tellez to score and Andrew McCutchen picked up his 1,000th career RBI. Initially both runners were ruled safe, but the Reds challenged the play, both on the force out at second and on slide interference by Wong. The ruling on the force out was overturned and Wong was out, but the call on no slide interference by Wong was upheld.</p>\n\n\n<p>Top 5th - @Reds challenge call that Kolten Wong is safe at 2B and call of no violation of the slide rule; the force play at 2B is overturned, runner is out. Additionally, there was no violation of the slide rule. Powered by @Mitel. pic.twitter.com/EzARXKA9sj</p>— MLB Replays (@MLBReplays) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The Brewers tacked on in the top of the seventh, with two more baserunners, this time with one out (Renfroe walk, Wong single). McCutchen added to his RBI total from there, with an RBI double that scored both Renfroe and Wong and gave the Brewers a 5-2 cushion.</p>\n\n\n<p>Cutch drove in his 1,000th RBI and then immediately added more to his resume.<br /><br />MLB x @loanDepot pic.twitter.com/FkzcOkdOIq</p>— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The bullpen continued to keep the Reds offense in check, but they did break through in the eighth. After Brad Boxberger pitched a scoreless seventh, Matt Bush took the eighth. The Reds got two baserunners with an Aristides Aquino walk and a Stuart Fairchild single. Alejo Lopez then grounded into what should have been an inning-ending double play, but Wong had a bad throw that allowed Aquino to score. The run was unearned to Bush, but the Reds closed the gap to 5-3.</p>\n<p>However, they would get no closer from there. Craig Counsell went to Devin Williams to finish the eighth, and then Williams added a scoreless ninth to finish the game.</p>\n<p>Every starter on the Brewers offense recorded a hit, with Kolten Wong and Garrett Mitchell having two-hit days. The offense had 11 hits and 6 walks in total, but a 2-for-15 day with runners in scoring position stopped them from blowing the game wide open. The Brewers had a runner in scoring position in every inning except the first and third, but left 12 runners on base as a team.</p>\n<p>In the Wild Card race, the Phillies blew out the Braves 9-1 to remain 2.5 games ahead of the Brewers. However, the Padres lost to the Rockies 4-3, and the Brewers are now just 2 games behind the Padres for the second Wild Card spot.</p>\n<p>Game three of the series takes place tomorrow, and the ace is back on the mound. Corbin Burnes will face Graham Ashcraft in Saturday’s game. First pitch is at 5:40 PM on Bally Sports Wisconsin and the Brewers Radio Network.</p>\n<p></p>",

        "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/24/steve-case-plan-starting/",
        "description": "<p>Steve Case, the cofounder of America Online, the investment firm Revolution, and its offshoot seed-stage arm Rise of the Rest, has a new book out called Rise of the Rest: How Entrepreneurs in Surprising Places are Building the New American Dream. In it, Case argues that Covid was a “shake the globe” moment for entrepreneurship, and that power will never again reside as it once did in cities like San Francisco and New York and Boston.</p>\n<p>We spoke earlier today with Case about the book; we also chatted with him about the mentality of coastal investors, whether he harbors any political aspirations, and the status of his relationship with Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance, who worked closely with Case at one point (they appeared together at our TechCrunch Disrupt event in 2018).</p>\n<p>Case also talked up a number of his bets, which have, perhaps to the surprise of skeptics, taken off since he began investing across the country. He relatedly suggested that one major piece of advice that he tries to impart when speaking with founders is the art of storytelling itself. (A powerful narrative can go a long way, particularly when you’re out of the sightline of some of the most powerful investors in the country.)</p>\n<p>More from our conversation follows. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity. (You can hear the longer conversation here.)</p>\n<p>TC: You’ve been on a mission dating back to 2014 to bring more attention to founders around the country,  traveling something like 11,000 miles across 33 cities. With Covid fading away, are you back on the road now or have you bookended that chapter?</p>\n<p>SC: It [that national tour] came out of some effort a little over 10 years ago; I was asked by President Obama to chair an initiative called Startup America Partnership. And that got me focused on regional entrepreneurship and this imbalance that we’ve talked about before in terms of how 75% of venture capital dollars [were] going to just three states. And the more we visited cities, the more cities we wanted to visit. We did obviously have to stop when the pandemic hit and we have not yet restarted in terms of physical tours. But we are spending a lot of time traveling around the country. The Rise of the Rest team, which is now about a dozen people, has visited dozens of cities over the last six months.</p>\n<p>Chris Olsen of Drive Capital in Columbus, Ohio told us a few weeks ago that though his firm had laid the groundwork for more VCs to come to the area, the opposite happened post Covid, that they’ve retreated back to the coasts. Are you seeing the same thing?</p>\n<p>[I think] while some may hunker down in a more difficult environment and focus more on their existing investments, I do believe we hit a tipping point during the pandemic, and that will result in an acceleration of more capital flowing to more cities and more entrepreneurs in those cities.</p>\n<p>Most people in most parts of the country, if they wanted to be part of the innovation economy, they felt they had to leave where they were to go to the coast. That started slowing over the last five years and picked up in terms of people relocating during the pandemic, [which] ended up being kind of a shake-the-snow-globe moment for society, and also for a lot of families. They kind of reassessed how they want to live and work and where they want to live and work, and that likely will result in a permanent, dynamic.</p>\n<p>Where has Rise of the Rest invested the most dollars?</p>\n<p>We have made 200 investments in 100 different cities, so it’s fairly broad. And we’re seeing momentum in many, many cities. Indianapolis is an example of a city that most people don’t really know what’s happening there [and one of the reasons is a] tentpole company that’s there, ExactTarget. It was acquired [in 2013] by Salesforce for $2.5 billion and, at the time, had 1,000 employees. Now Salesforce has 2,000 employees in Indianapolis, and [it’s] the second-largest Salesforce office outside of San Francisco, and the founder of that company and many of the early employees of that company have gone on to start new companies.</p>\n<p>We also have seen interest in places like Richmond, Virginia; we backed a company called TemperPack that focuses on sustainable packaging. They actually started in New York City but decided to move to Richmond to build out their manufacturing capabilities, and they’ve gone on to raise $140 million in a round led by Goldman Sachs. We backed [online farmland investment company] AcreTrader whose founder, Carter Malloy, was in San Francisco and decided to move to Arkansas to get the close to where the farmers are. We invested in Chattanooga in a company called Freightwaves that’s focused on building a Bloomberg data platform for the trucking and logistics industry.</p>\n<p>Have you had any exits?</p>\n<p>One of our seed companies, [Kentucky-based] AppHarvest, went public about a year ago [via a SPAC]. In July, another company based in the D.C. area, FiscalNote went public [via SPAC]. There’s another company out of Kansas City called Backlotcars that was acquired with a pretty significant exit .</p>\n<p>I think we’ve seen [the portfolio] get to seven unicorns so far, so it really bodes well for what’s happening in these places.</p>\n<p>How does one go into business with you?</p>\n<p>For the Rise of the Rest fund, we’ve invested with over 300 different regional venture capitalists. They lead the rounds [and] they take the board seat, because of the velocity of investments we were making. We play more of a role of connecting these entrepreneurs and connecting these investors to build essentially a Rise of the Rest network.</p>\n<p>Do you fund these venture firms as a limited partner?</p>\n<p>We did some of that early on, but because we’ve co-invested now with over 300 of them, we were getting a lot of requests to be investors in those funds, and we decided to back off on that because we wanted to build the broadest possible network.</p>\n<p>At the very same time that people are moving back to their home towns or other more affordable places, the political landscape is changing in dramatic ways that some are sure to find off-putting. Abortion bans are so divisive. </p>\n<p>Historically, cities were competing to get companies to move. Now they’re competing to get people to move. And everybody will have a different set of criteria that they prioritize. Maybe they move for family reasons, or cost of living reasons, or because there’s industry expertise in an area that you want to build on, or [it could tie to] lifestyle choices like biking or skiing. With some states, taxes make it more attractive.</p>\n<p>I do think people will factor in some of these social issues, including the recent Dobbs ruling, and take a step back, and I think people making these decisions– whether it be local and state leaders or others in the community, even the media — should be thinking about and being aware [of this issue]. I think we want to avoid hyper partisanship in the country. We have enough issues that divide the country; we want to avoid a sort of entrepreneurial culture war.</p>\n<p>As someone who has run an international business and probably been under pressure yourself to be political, do you think companies should take a stance on social issues?</p>\n<p>I think every CEO has to decide, and some [of that] depends on which issues they want to weigh in on and which issues they think are most important to their key constituents, whether it be their employees or their customers or others. But [some of why people move to certain places will tie] to what the mayors and governors and politicians do. But some of it also will be what the entrepreneurs and the CEOs of the big companies decide to do.</p>\n<p>I’m curious about your relationship with JD Vance. He managed the Rise of the Rest fund at the outset. What is your current relationship with him and what do you think of some of the positions that he has taken?</p>\n<p>JD joined us probably four or five years ago, right after he came out with the Hillbilly Elegy book. Part of the reason for that is his wife Usha was going to be working in the Supreme Court as a clerk there for a year in Washington, DC, and we’re headquartered in Washington, DC. So he really helped launch the first Rise of the Rest fund. But after they were in DC for a year, they decided to move to Ohio, and he continued in the role for another maybe six months or so but ultimately decided he wanted to launch his own fund, which he did in Cincinnati.</p>\n<p>I have not talked to him since he announced last year that he was running for Senate and I’ve not supported that campaign. Frankly, I’ve been surprised by some of the things he has said, which are, by his own admission, inconsistent with some of the positions he took several years ago.</p>\n<p>Do you have any ambitions to become a politician? You have that beloved CEO thing going for you.</p>\n<p>I appreciate you saying that, but part of the reason I think I’ve been successful on policy, including even a decade ago, working on the JOBS Act — the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act — and more recently, some of the work around regional hubs is because I’m not political. When we’re traveling around, we invite Democrats and Republicans to join us on the bus and everything we’re doing is trying to make innovation, make entrepreneurship, make startups, and make job creation a nonpartisan issue.</p>\n<p>Steve Case is trying to make money with founders outside Silicon Valley; his plan is starting to work by Connie Loizos originally published on TechCrunch</p>",

        "description": "<p>U.S. Intelligence officials have resumed their national security risk review of top-secret documents that were seized at former President Donald Trump’s Florida estate, according to a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The resumption, which has not been previously reported, comes after a federal appeals court delivered the Justice Department a decisive win, unanimously blocking elements of a lower-court ruling that forced federal prosecutors to seek a pause in the highly anticipated intelligence review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In consultation with the Department of Justice, ODNI is resuming the classification review of relevant materials and assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of the relevant documents,” an ODNI spokesperson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both reviews ramped back up this week after a three-judge panel on Wednesday reversed major elements of a previous ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her decision granting Trump’s request for a special master to sift through the classified documents and separate potentially privileged materials, Cannon barred the Department of Justice (DOJ) from using that set of documents to advance its criminal investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She later clarified that her prior order should not prevent the national security reviews from moving forward, but DOJ said that wasn’t sufficient because the two actions are “inextricably linked.” In a recent court filing, prosecutors said “the criminal investigation is itself essential to the government’s effort to identify and mitigate potential national-security risks.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prosecutors also argued Cannon’s order was unworkable because the FBI — which executed the search warrant on Trump’s estate and is an integral part of the criminal probe — is also a key member of the intelligence community and could be roped into the damage assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 11th Circuit’s Wednesday ruling blocked parts of Cannon’s order, allowing prosecutors to use documents with classification markings as part of the criminal probe. The panel sharply rejected Cannon’s reasoning and embraced DOJ’s assertions that the criminal review of the records was a crucial element of assessing national security damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“No party has offered anything beyond speculation to undermine [DOJ’s] representation — supported by sworn testimony — that findings from the criminal investigation may be critical to its national-security review,” the judges wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citing consultations with the Justice Department in the wake of Cannon’s initial ruling, ODNI said earlier this month that it had paused “the classification review of relevant materials and assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of the relevant documents,” according to a spokesperson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An intelligence briefing for congressional leaders on the documents found at Mar-a-Lago was put on hold after Cannon’s ruling, too, but it’s unclear when that might occur. The intelligence community’s work is of paramount importance to members of Congress, especially the select few who have intelligence oversight responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We haven’t heard anything,” Senate Intelligence Vice Chair Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said in a brief interview this week. “I don’t know why they’ve been so unresponsive. I don’t see the rationale for it. At some point, we’ll have to increase the scrutiny.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, members of Congress have not yet been briefed about what was recovered at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate — or anything else about the Justice Department’s investigation. A highly redacted document outlining the department’s rationale for seeking a search warrant for Trump’s home revealed that prosecutors are investigating possible violations of the Espionage Act, the Presidential Records Act, and obstruction of justice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The predominant concern that we have is getting to the bottom of whether any sources or methods have been compromised, and now need to be mitigated,” House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nicholas Wu and Kyle Cheney contributed to this report.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The U.S. Department of Treasury announced Friday it was updating guidance to expand internet service to Iranians, most of whom have been cut off from the internet by their own government amid its violent crackdown on peaceful protests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“While Iran’s government is cutting off its people’s access to the global internet, the United States is taking action to support the free flow of information and access to fact-based information to the Iranian people,” the Treasury said in a press release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The police’s violent clashes with protesters continued Friday, with State TV suggesting on Thursday that the death toll from the unrest could be as high as 26 people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Treasury Department said Friday it was issuing Iran General License D-2 — an updated license that will expand internet services to people in Iran “by bringing U.S. sanctions guidance in line with the changes in modern technology since its initial issuance.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new guidance will offer more options of secure internet platforms and services. The new license addresses a range of internet freedom issues, such as adding covered categories of software and services including social media platforms and video conferencing, as well as providing additional authorization for communication tools “to assist ordinary Iranians in resisting repressive internet censorship.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“With these changes, we are helping the Iranian people be better equipped to counter the government’s efforts to surveil and censor them,” Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in the press release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A senior Treasury official said on a call with reporters on Friday that the department will endeavor in the coming weeks to issue additional guidance to help businesses and NGOs take advantage of the new authorizations under the updated license.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The U.S. government will continue to identify those opportunities to support the Iranian people’s right and ability to communicate freely and without fear of government reprisal,” the Treasury official said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A senior State Department official on the call clarified that while the action is meant to support the free flow of information to the Iranian people, it does not erase the tools Iran’s government has to hinder its people’s ability to communicate with the outside world. But the official said the updated license will make it “much easier” for the Iranian people to confront the government’s repressive communications tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This general license does not remove every tool of communications repression that the government of Iran has to direct at its own people,” the State Department official said. “It will over time give the Iranian people more tools to address those efforts from the Iranian government.”</p>",

In one incident, a woman armed with a toy gun staged a bank hold-up to pay family medical bills. Although the authorities have condemned the raids, they have drawn widespread public support. Since the 2019 collapse of Lebanon's financial system, 80% of the population is struggling for money. There are water shortages and frequent power cuts. We speak to Ghida who backs the bank raids because, she says, people are desperate. We hear from Elize, a cancer patient who shares her experiences of trying to get the drugs she needs to stay alive. Her doctor, professor Fadi Nasr, reminds us how hospitals in Lebanon used to be the best in the Middle East but they have now run out of basic supplies.",

        "description": "Upon the release of the second-generation AirPods Pro, the AirPods Max became the oldest current-generation AirPods product still in Apple's lineup. Introducing several new features like Adaptive Transparency and the H2 chip, the second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ may provide some of the best indications yet of what to expect from the second-generation ‌AirPods Max‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlmost two years later, rumors about a successor to the original ‌AirPods Max‌ are thin on the ground. The last we heard about the next-generation ‌AirPods Max‌ was a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in May 2021, which explained that Apple was considering launching new color options for the device. In addition to new color options and revised audio hardware, there are at least ten potential ‌AirPods Pro‌ features that could make their way to the second version of the ‌AirPods Max‌. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nH2 Chips\r<br />\nThe second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ are the first device to contain the H2 chip, Apple's custom silicon chip designed specifically for earbuds and headphones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe H2 chip enables improved computational audio to enhance sound quality on the ‌AirPods Pro‌ and improves battery life with better energy efficiency. As the ‌AirPods Max‌ are Apple's most high-end AirPods, it seems almost certain that the next version will contain an H2 chip in each earcup. The chips will likely be at the heart of any improvements to the device's audio hardware. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nBluetooth 5.3 Connectivity\r<br />\nAlongside the H2 chip, the new ‌AirPods Pro‌ feature Bluetooth 5.3, a specification that has also come to the entire iPhone 14 lineup as well as the Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 8, and Apple Watch Ultra. As such, it is inevitable that the second-generation ‌AirPods Max‌ will similarly feature the latest Bluetooth standard. Bluetooth 5.3 offers features important enhancements to reliability, connection performance, and power consumption.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nImproved Active Noise Cancellation\r<br />\nThanks to the H2 chip, the second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ feature improved Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) that is up to two times more effective at blocking out unwanted noise.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe outward-facing microphones detect external sound so the AirPods can analyze environmental noise, while the inward-facing microphone listens to the sound coming toward the ear. The new ‌AirPods Pro‌ then adapts the sound signal reaching the ears 48,000 times per second to eliminate external noise.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ are also equipped with a new driver and improved acoustic algorithms to reduce additional unwanted noise. As the only other AirPods to offer ANC, it seems inevitable that with the H2 chip, the second-generation ‌AirPods Max‌ will also offer enhanced ANC.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAdaptive Transparency\r<br />\nThe second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ feature an all-new Adaptive Transparency mode that allows important environmental noise like speech in, while heavily reducing unwanted environmental noise like a passing vehicle siren, construction tools, or even loud speakers at a concert. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe feature is designed for \"for more comfortable everyday listening,\" according to Apple. Along with improvements to ANC facilitated by the H2 chip, it seems highly likely that the second-generation ‌AirPods Max‌ will also feature Adaptive Transparency. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nConversation Boost\r<br />\nIt is also possible that the ‌AirPods Max‌ could also gain Conversation Boost, a feature that has thus far been exclusive to the ‌AirPods Pro‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDesigned to help people with mild hearing challenges hear conversations better, Conversation Boost uses the beam-forming microphones on the ‌‌AirPods Pro‌‌ to boost the volume of a person talking directly in front of you, making it easier to hear what they are saying.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSkin-Detect Sensors\r<br />\nApple's skin-detect sensor technology was first introduced on the third-generation AirPods and recently expanded to the ‌AirPods Pro‌, leaving the ‌AirPods Max‌ as the only current-generation AirPods product without the feature. The current ‌AirPods Max‌ still use optical IR sensors to detect when they are placed over a user's ears.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile skin-detect sensors would not be quite as useful on the ‌AirPods Max‌ since playback is unlikely to be triggered on a surface or in a pocket, they could help playback pause and resume more quickly and accurately. The skin-detect sensors are also more efficient and deliver better battery life – something that the ‌AirPods Max‌ could also take advantage of.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLonger Battery Life\r<br />\nApple touts improved battery life for both the third-generation AirPods and the second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌. The second-generation ‌AirPods Max‌ could gain a similar battery life boost using the efficiency gains of the H2 chip, Bluetooth 5.3, and skin-detect sensors, providing Apple does not shrink the size of the internal battery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSweat and Water Resistance\r<br />\nThe third-generation AirPods and second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ feature IPX4-rated sweat and water resistant earbuds and charging cases. This is an area that Apple has improved over time on its various earbuds, but the first-generation ‌AirPods Max‌ do not feature any sweat or water resistance rating.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome sort of sweat and water resistance rating for the second-generation model seems plausible, especially given Apple's growing focus on health and fitness. Apple Fitness+ launched just a day before the release of the first-generation ‌AirPods Max‌ in 2020, so it is not out of the question for the second-generation model to have more of a focus on fitness by being sweat-resistant.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nU1 Chip and Precision Finding\r<br />\nThe second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌'s MagSafe Charging Case features an Apple U1 chip for Precision Finding in the Find My app, much like AirTag item trackers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current ‌AirPods Max‌ feature basic support for ‌Find My‌, but a U1 chip in the second-generation version could enable a much more precise way to locate the headphones when they are nearby.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCharging\r<br />\nThe second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌'s case added the ability to charge using an Apple Watch charger, adding to the plethora of charging options that already included ‌MagSafe‌, Qi wireless charging, and Lightning.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is too early to say if the second-generation ‌AirPods Max‌ will feature a new way to charge, such as via ‌MagSafe‌, but such a change would necessitate deeper changes to the ‌AirPods Max‌'s design. Nevertheless, the fact that Apple now provides four different ways to charge the ‌AirPods Pro‌ could indicate that it is aware of the benefits of multiple ways to charge and could want to expand this to its highest-end headphones in some way.

        "description": "<p>The Booker-shortlisted author on the enduring popularity of Olive Kitteridge, cancel culture and why she couldn’t avoid US politics in her latest Lucy Barton novel</p><p>Elizabeth Strout had just finished writing her Booker-shortlisted novel Oh William!, revisiting her much loved character Lucy Barton, when the pandemic struck. Now, barely a year later, we have Lucy by the Sea, another in the series, which follows Lucy and her former husband William as they flee New York for a damp house in New England, to sit out the pandemic. “Lucy and William were just so much in my head. I thought: OK, let’s have him take her up to the coast of Maine, and stick them on this cliff and see what happens,” Strout says from her house in Brunswick, Maine, which she and her husband have made their permanent home since lockdown. The two novels “work together”, she says. “I see them as a continuation of each other.”</p><p>Since My Name Is Lucy Barton in 2016, which introduced us to Lucy and her estranged mother, and the extreme poverty of her childhood, Strout has written another four books – quite a sprint for a writer who published her first novel, Amy and Isabelle, when she was 43, waiting another eight years before a follow-up, Abide With Me. While both were critically acclaimed, it was with her third novel, Olive Kitteridge, about a retired school teacher in Maine, that her career really took off. Her prickly, no-nonsense heroine with a fondness for proclaiming “Hell’s bells!” became an unlikely hit and byword for a kind of New England melancholy orneriness. The novel won a Pulitzer prize in 2009 and resulted in a devoted readership, helped along by an Emmy-winning HBO series starring Frances McDormand. Olive’s many fans will be delighted to know she pops up in this new novel (she’s now in a retirement home) inspiring another shoe-stealing stunt.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>DJ LeMahieu is not close to returning; the flack over Apple airing Friday’s game; Oswaldo Cabrera wants to play left in the playoffs; a history of one of the best Aaron Judge moments this year</p> <p>New York Daily News | Kristie Ackert: The Yankees offense has looked better as of late, especially the crucial non-Aaron Judge players. Unfortunately, one of their key players in DJ LeMahieu is still not close to his return from the IL. The toe injury that threw his season off the rails is not gone — while he recently took batting practice on the field, he reported afterwards that he can’t play with how his foot felt during it. He’s simply still participating in baseball activities so that, if he can ramp back up, he isn’t starting from zero. With how he hit with the injury, rushing him back even for the playoffs doesn't seem like a viable option.</p>\n<p>NJ.com | Bridget Hyland: The kerfuffle over Apple TV+ holding the exclusive rights to Friday’s night game while Judge chased history reached as high as the New York Attorney General’s office. Michael Kay was blessed by MLB and the YES Network to call the game, but he declined out of respect for the existing crew. Apple’s crews and broadcasts haven’t exactly gotten rave reviews, an aspect of their deal with MLB put deeper in the spotlight with their chance to air history.</p>\n<p>NJ.com | Brendan Kuty: Oswaldo Cabrera has dipped his toes into the left field waters this season, after already showing some real skills in right. The injury to Andrew Benintendi and the struggles of Aaron Hicks means the spot is glaringly open to patrol the outfield alongside Harrison Bader and Judge. Cabrera, for his part, thinks he’ll be fine playing left in the playoffs. He admits it’s not an easy transition, but that he and the coaching staff have been working hard to get him used to it.</p>\n<p>ESPN | Ryan Hockensmith: One amazing aspect of Judge’s amazing season that you may have forgotten during the home run record chase is his experience with young Yankee fan Derek Rodriguez. A Blue Jays fan caught a Judge home run during a game in Toronto and, seeing the young fan, gave him the ball, making the kid emotional in what turned into a viral moment. ESPN gets into the longer story of the people involved, and it might get you choked up all over again. </p>",

Cycling to Iceland is a complex business: ferry to Amsterdam from Newcastle, trains to Aarhus, cycle up through Jutland to the port of Hirtshals, close to the northern tip of Denmark, ferries onward to the Faroe Islands, which I will explore by bicycle before embarking for more cycling around the east of Iceland.

One small sacrifice for the climate emergency, but also a chance to alert everyone to the wonderful adventures that can be had without flying.</p><p>But four days before departure, I find myself in hospital staring at a very sick person who cannot be left. Weeks of planning and preparation are in jeopardy. Departure day passes, but then the miracle of intravenous antibiotics happens and I realise I can still travel, catching up with my own itinerary if I make a few changes.</p> Continue reading...",

Cycling to Iceland is a complex business: ferry to Amsterdam from Newcastle, trains to Aarhus, cycle up through Jutland to the port of Hirtshals, close to the northern tip of Denmark, ferries onward to the Faroe Islands, which I will explore by bicycle before embarking for more cycling around the east of Iceland.

One small sacrifice for the climate emergency, but also a chance to alert everyone to the wonderful adventures that can be had without flying.</p><p>But four days before departure, I find myself in hospital staring at a very sick person who cannot be left. Weeks of planning and preparation are in jeopardy. Departure day passes, but then the miracle of intravenous antibiotics happens and I realise I can still travel, catching up with my own itinerary if I make a few changes.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photo by Elsa/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>After two closely contested wins, the Yankees look for a series win on top of history.</p> <p>Much was made about how the Red Sox were going to attack Aaron Judge in this series, and while it didn’t materialize in the first game Rich Hill and company did give him some opportunities to play out his at-bats. Judge wasn’t able to get the better of them for once, earning a single in his last at-bat of the night but otherwise staying quiet, but fortunately the rest of the offense was alive and did enough to secure the win. The team is quietly on a roll again, winning five straight and 13 of 19 in September after their truly terrible August — perhaps peaking at just the right time to enter the postseason red-hot again.</p>\n<p>Whether that’s the case or not will be determined in a few weeks, but until then the Yankees have to handle what’s right in front of them, and a series win is on the table this afternoon. Before the game kicks off, Andrew will catch you up on the rest of the AL action and I’ll provide the latest Judge home run pace. John shares some of his thoughts on the potential for history today as he prepares to be in the Stadium to witness it, Esteban praises Harrison Bader’s immediately noticeable defensive prowess, and Estevão goes over the latest MLB poll. Afterwards, Kevin reflects on Judge’s 2018 injury and the trajectory he’s been on ever since. </p>\nToday’s Matchup:\n<p>New York Yankees vs. Boston Red Sox</p>\n<p>Time: 1:05 p.m. ET</p>\n<p>AD</p>\n<p>TV: YES Network, NESN, MLB Network (out-of-market, only)</p>\n<p>Radio: 1280 WADO, 660/101.9 FM WFAN</p>\n<p>Venue: Yankee Stadium</p>\nFun Questions/Prompts:\n<p>  1.

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeat pumps operate similarly to refrigeration systems such as air conditioners (ACs), with the only difference of producing hot instead of chilled water, and offering both heating and cooling options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeat pumps consume a lot less energy and are at least three times more energy efficient compared to conventional heating and air conditioning systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeat pumps cost a bit more upfront but do save money on utility bills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Heat pumps have long been heralded as a vital solution to electrification yet they only account for less than 10 percent of global building heating demand, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IEA’s Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario would require the installation of 600 million heat pumps globally by 2030, up from 177.3 million in 2020.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, with energy security being top of mind in response to rising geopolitical tensions and continued supply chain disruptions, the IEA also highlighted the deployment of heat pumps as part of its 10-point plan to reduce dependence on Russian natural gas.  </p>\n\n\n\nThe climate benefits of heat pumps \n\n\n\n<p>Heat pumps operate similarly to refrigeration systems such as air conditioners (ACs), with the only difference of producing hot instead of chilled water, and offering both heating and cooling options.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During winter months, heat pumps transfer heat from the cold outdoors to heat up your home, while during summer, they remove heat from the air inside and push cool air back. Because they transfer heat from the air, water or ground instead of generating it by burning oil or gas such as boilers or furnaces, heat pumps consume a lot less energy and are at least three times more energy efficient compared to conventional heating and air conditioning systems. As heat pumps run on electricity, if that electricity is sourced from renewable energy, they can make a substantial contribution to building decarbonization.   </p>\n\n\n\nChallenges to adoption \n\n\n\n<p>Despite their proven benefits in terms of greater energy efficiency and reduced carbon emissions, heat pumps have not yet seen the same market growth as solar, wind or batteries, due to challenges related to costs, shortage in qualified installers and insufficient manufacturing and policy support.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems typically last 15 to 20 years so households would realistically only consider replacement every one to two decades if their existing equipment breaks down. In such emergency cases, families will opt for the cheapest equipment that’s readily available on the shelves, with heat pumps often not the most accessible or affordable option.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A few things need to align to make sure people get a heat pump under those conditions. Contractors need to be familiar with the technology, so they'll recommend it. Heat pumps need to be in stock at the local distributor, so people don't need to wait too long. The price needs to be low enough, so families can afford the upfront cost. And any subsidy program needs to be simple enough to navigate, so people can actually get the money,” says Alexander Gard-Murray, a political economist at Brown University’s Climate Solutions Lab.  </p>\n\n\n\nThe costs and cost savings from switching to heat pumps \n\n\n\n<p>All HVAC systems, and not just heat pumps, are expensive to install, and although heat pumps offer savings on utility bills over the long run, switching to them might require higher upfront costs including home upgrades besides the installation itself.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The average cost of a heat pump varies from country to country, and will depend on labor costs, the local climate, the size of your building, installation complexity and equipment type.  In the UK, for example, a heat pump would cost around $12,000 compared to approximately $8,500 in Poland, according to Jan Rosenow, Director of European Programmes at the Regulatory Assistance Project (RAP), an energy non-profit.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.S., climate research platform Carbon Switch estimates installation costs to range between $3,500 and $20,000, with an average cost of approximately $14,000 after rebates. The installation of a higher-end heat pump that’s better suited for colder climates could go up to $18,000-25,000, shares Nate Adams, CEO of HVAC 2.0, which focuses on building more cost- and energy-efficient homes, in comparison to $9,000-12,000 for a basic HVAC system.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, once installed, households could save between 12 and 55 percent on their annual electricity bills, according to a study by CLASP, a non-profit advocating for more sustainable and energy efficient appliances. The exact amount of savings would again depend on the same factors that determine heat pump costs in addition to your current heating and insulation system.    </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operating costs vary by climate and energy costs, but as natural gas prices soar and renewable energy production increases, “heat pumps are very likely to be the cheapest heat source in all but the coldest climates,” adds Adams who aims to make electrification accessible to all homeowners through practical solutions such as “The Electrify Everything Course”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, Carbon Switch has shown that switching to heat pumps could help households cut carbon emissions by 1.1 to 7.6 tons – more than going vegan, which would reduce your carbon footprint by approximately one ton a year, and 10 times more compared to installing LED lighting.  </p>\n\n\n\nConsumer incentives and policy support  \n\n\n\n<p>Creating the right financial support mechanisms which could reduce the upfront costs of installing heat pumps and policy changes that would encourage an increase in heat pump manufacturing are vital to drive greater adoption, experts say.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reforming energy taxes could be one policy lever to lower the running costs of heat pumps compared to heating with oil or gas, shares Rosenow. Some countries have also announced a gradual ban on fossil fuel heating systems, including Germany which set a target of installing heating systems which use a minimum of 65 percent renewable energy by 2025. Under its Boiler Upgrade Scheme, the UK offers grants to reduce the cost of installing air or ground source heat pumps.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) put in place a slew of incentives, including a 30 percent tax credit of up to $2,000, but it only applies to heat pumps which achieved the Consortium for Energy Efficiency (CEE)’s highest tier for efficiency, clarifies Adams. The bill also introduced additional rebates for low- and moderate-income households, but these will be managed by individual states who have up to two years to implement the program.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There's still a risk that despite the generous subsidies, there could still be a gap between the money a low-income family gets and the cost of a new, high-efficiency heat pump,” says Gard-Murray.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adams also warns that new refrigerants and higher efficiency requirements are expected next year which would make heat pumps more expensive and likely offset the incentives.  </p>\n\n\n\nIncentivizing manufacturers and distributors \n\n\n\n<p>Instead of focusing on consumers alone, Adams and Gard-Murray, together with CLASP, have last year published a proposal for Hybrid Heat Homes (3H), an incentive program that would target manufacturers and distributors. An incentive of $400 to $500 would be offered to those who make a complete switch from producing and selling one-way ACs to two-way heat pumps.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Adams, since the manufacturing and installation process for ACs and heat pumps are almost the same, upgrading from an AC to a heat pump of the same model would only cost around $300-600. “Fundamentally ACs and heat pumps are identical, think of two identical cars but one has a reverse gear and the other does not.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The authors estimate that for around $10 billion in incentives, the program would save consumers $27 billion in utility bills over a ten-year period, in addition to $80 billion or more in additional societal benefits thanks to reduced air pollution and improved health.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parts of the 3H proposal have since been included in the Heating Efficiency and Affordability Tax Relief (HEATR) Act, although it also proposes subsidies that are not conditional on the switch from ACs to heat pumps. HEATR has been introduced in the Senate but is yet to be passed.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the UK is preparing a quota that would require manufacturers to sell an increasing share of heat pumps over time.   </p>\n\n\n\nIndustry and energy storage applications \n\n\n\n<p>Heat pumps can also be applied in a number of industrial processes, such as drying, boiling, distillation, preheating or pasteurization in the food, paper or chemical industries, from refining sugar to repurposing waste heat into useful energy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the solution is still in the early stages, heat pumps could likewise help to address the intermittency issues associated with wind and solar, by storing energy and effectively turning houses into giant batteries.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Heat pumps have a load profile that matches well with wind generation as previous research shows. Combining onsite solar with heat pumps can lower the running costs of heat pumps and reduce the amount of grid-imported electricity,” says Rosenow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the IEA, heat pumps together with energy storage could enable 40 percent of electricity to be produced by solar PV and wind power by 2030.  </p>\n\n\n\nLimited adoption in emerging markets  \n\n\n\n<p>Most heat pump installations are concentrated in developed countries and China, while the rest of developing nations account for only 4.3 percent of total heat pump adoption globally. Driving greater adoption of heat pumps in developing countries, which continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels for their energy needs, will be equally critical to global decarbonization efforts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As demand for air conditioning increases, introducing policy that would ensure that new AC units are two-way heat pumps could be one way to increase deployment, advises Adams.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Improving labeling standards to educate consumers on how much they can save with a heat pump, and helping developing countries build more clean energy infrastructure through aid and technology transfer will also be key to making sure that electricity is cheap enough to power the heat pump transition, adds Gard-Murray.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Rosenow concludes, “not all buildings will have a heat pump and other technologies such as district heating and solar thermal will also play an important role. However, most analyses identify heat pumps as the most important heating technology in order to meet the climate goals.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trang Chu Minh previously wrote about tiger conservation.</p>",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo openly gay candidates next month will go head-to-head in a federal general election for the first time in U.S. history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould either Robert Zimmerman, a Democrat, or George Santos, a Republican, win in November, they will become the first openly LGBTQ+ person to represent the district and the fourth out LGBTQ+ person elected to Congress from New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 1,000 openly LGBTQ+ people this year ran for public office in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In a first, two openly gay candidates next month will go head-to-head in a federal general election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert Zimmerman, a Democrat, and George Santos, a Republican, are vying for a seat in New York’s 3rd congressional district left open by Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.), who last year launched a bid for governor of New York and said he would not seek reelection in Congress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The district leans Democratic – President Biden won it by 10 points in 2020 – but the race is still considered competitive by the Cook Political Report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should either Zimmerman or Santos win in November, they would be the first openly LGBTQ+ person to lead the district, which represents Long Island and Queens, N.Y. The congressman-elect would join two other out gay members of Congress from New York – Rep. Ritchie Torres (D) and Rep. Sean Maloney (D). Rep. Mondaire Jones (D), the first openly gay Black person to serve in Congress, lost his bid for a second term in August’s primary election.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>America is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>“We all bring our personal stories into public life,” Zimmerman told Changing America in a recent interview. “The question is, do they prompt us to help others?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Growing up in Nassau County in the 1960s and 70s wasn’t easy for Zimmerman, 67, who knew he was gay at an early age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“At that time, it was a very isolating place for those of us that were gay,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a teenager, on nights when his friends took girls to school dances, Zimmerman sat alone at a table at the Seven Seas Diner in Great Neck, N.Y., watching the clock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I didn’t want to admit to my folks I didn’t have a date,” he said. “It’s just what you did.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once, after confiding in one of his school teachers that he thought he might be gay, Zimmerman was referred to conversion therapy – a discredited practice that aims to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. It’s since been outlawed in 20 states, including New York, and the District of Columbia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I wasn’t gonna go there,” Zimmerman said, “but when you're young, it's kind of hard to shake the idea that maybe you're not well.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After decades of feeling voiceless, Zimmerman as a young adult decided to speak up for himself and his community, spending years on Capitol Hill working for Democratic congressmen. It’s a mission he carries with him today, as renewed threats to LGBTQ+ rights like marriage equality and privacy are introduced by state and federal officials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I have fought those fights, and I'm not going to let another generation of LGBTQ+ young people be shoved back in the closet,” Zimmerman said. “It's not going to happen on my watch.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zimmerman and Santos are two of 101 openly LGBTQ+ candidates to seek a seat in Congress this election cycle, the most in U.S. history, according to the LGBTQ Victory Fund, which has endorsed Zimmerman in the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“LGBT candidates are more electable than ever before,” Cesar Toledo, the group’s political director, told Changing America in an interview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toledo said more races between openly LGBTQ+ candidates are expected to happen moving forward as the number of out LGBTQ+ people running for public office continues to spike. More than 1,000 ran for office this year, according to the LGBTQ Victory Fund, which advocates for equitable representation in government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is a new, beautiful problem we have,” Toledo said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, just 17 out LGBTQ+ people have won seats in the House in Congress’ 232-year history, and only two have been elected to the Senate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among openly LGBTQ+ Republicans who launched congressional bids this year, Santos is the only one to make it to a general election. All current members of Congress that openly identify as LGBTQ+ are Democrats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Santos did not respond to multiple interview requests from Changing America, but told NBC News this week that he sees no contradiction between his sexual orientation and the politics of his party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As a lifelong Republican, I have never experienced discrimination in the Republican Party,” Santos said. “I am an openly gay candidate. I am not shy.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July, House Republicans overwhelmingly voted against passing the Respect for Marriage Act, which would enshrine marriage equality in federal law. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), one of the lead negotiators on the measure in the Senate and the chamber’s first openly gay member, announced last week that action on the bill would be delayed until after the midterm elections, with Senate Republicans seeking stronger religious liberty protections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Santos has also been an ardent supporter of measures largely unpopular among his LGBTQ+ peers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an Instagram post in April, Santos praised Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for protecting traditional values and the “innocence of children” by signing the state’s controversial Parental Rights in Education bill into law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The legislation has been dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” law by its critics for its heavy restrictions on talk of sexual orientation and gender identity in K-12 classrooms, which the measure’s proponents – including Santos – have equated to “grooming” and child abuse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Zimmerman, the two men’s shared sexual orientation is “the beginning and end of our similarities.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zimmerman said he’s prepared to work collaboratively with far-right congresspeople if he is elected next month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Part of the challenge of governance is that you sit at the table with people who don't believe you're entitled to the same rights they have,” he said. “But we have to come together, in a bipartisan way, to get things done.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of August, Santos had out-raised Zimmerman by about $600,000 and had $790,000 in cash on hand compared to Zimmerman’s $478,000.</p>",

        "title": "US quietly pursues Middle East breakthrough with Israel-Lebanon deal",
        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3658930-us-quietly-pursues-middle-east-breakthrough-with-israel-lebanon-deal/",
        "description": "<p>The Biden administration is on the verge of a significant breakthrough in Middle East relations as it quietly pursues an agreement between Israel and Lebanon on territorial maritime borders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The negotiations appear to be closing in on the finish line amid intensive negotiations between U.S., Israeli and Lebanese officials that took place this week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The administration has taken pains to downplay the significance of the potential agreement — concerned that anything that appears to look like normalization between Israel and Lebanon would set off a catastrophic fight with Hezbollah, which has an estimated 150,000 missiles positioned on Israel’s northern border.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if successful, an agreement between Lebanon and Israel — with Beirut implicitly recognizing Israel’s legitimacy while the two sides are at war — would mark a tremendous victory for the Biden administration’s use of diplomacy to advance Middle East stability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It would be a very significant win for the Biden administration, and frankly it would be a significant win for regional stability and de-escalation of tensions,” said Mona Yacoubian, a senior adviser in the Middle East and North Africa Center at the U.S. Institute of Peace. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The negotiations are being led by ​​Amos Hochstein, special presidential coordinator for international energy. He launched mediations between Israel and Lebanon in mid-October, following up on talks that were initiated during the former Trump administration in 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The talks have gained little attention, in part because of greater world crises such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But this also reflects an effort on the part of the administration to maintain a low profile. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think this is being managed quite well on the part of the administration and Amos Hochstein in particular,” Yacoubian said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He’s really been very diligent in his shuttle diplomacy. I think he’s demonstrating, really, and he’s embodying what the hard work of diplomacy looks like and, if there is a deal, what it can yield.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The agreement is expected to draw a border between Israel and Lebanon in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and demarcate claims that both Beirut and Jerusalem identify as their exclusive economic zone. It would sort out how the two nations could benefit from exploration of the Karish natural gas field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lebanese officials are signaling major progress in reaching a deal. Lebanese Prime Minister-designate Najib Mikati said during his speech at the General Assembly that “we have achieved tangible progress which we hope will reach its aspired conclusions soon.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the progress is a consensus between Israel and Lebanon on the benefits of resolving the maritime boundary. Israel wants to avoid conflict with Lebanon and generally advance its relations in the region, and Lebanon is in dire need of any economic benefit that would come from being able to explore gas extraction in this part of the Mediterranean Sea. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the agreement on the maritime boundary is unlikely to yield immediate economic benefits for Lebanon, which is viewed as being in a crisis economic state, it is viewed as a positive development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A potential agreement is under a time crunch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Energean, the Greek-British energy company that holds a license to develop the Karish gas field, said in a September press release it “remains on track to deliver first gas from the Karish development project within weeks.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development of the fields could help European countries wean themselves off Russian natural gas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As Europeans seek substitutes for Russian energy sources, the eastern Mediterranean is becoming increasingly important in that regard,” Yacoubian said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Hezbollah, the U.S.-designated terrorist group that controls southern Lebanon and holds immense power in the country, has over the last few weeks increased the number of its threatening statements against Israel over the border negotiations and gas extraction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah said last week that “we are following up on the negotiations and all our eyes are on Karish and our missiles are locked on Karish.” He warned Israel against extracting gas absent an agreement with Lebanon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The red line to us is that there should not be extraction from Karish,” he said, in televised remarks reported by the Naharnet news site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid responded in a statement Monday that gas extraction is not connected to the U.S.-mediated negotiations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Israel believes that it is both possible and necessary to reach an agreement on a maritime line between Lebanon and Israel. … The production of gas from the Karish rig is not connected to these negotiations, and the production of gas from the rig will commence without delay, as soon as it is possible,\" the statement read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in a briefing with reporters on Wednesday in New York, Lapid said that “Israel is strong and knows how to defend itself” if an agreement is not reached with Lebanon addressing Israel’s “security, diplomatic and economic needs,” Axios reported. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yacoubian, of the Institute of Peace, said that Nasrallah’s threats appear to be “theater.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s a lot of saber rattling, but that might be because it’s a prelude to a negotiated agreement,” she said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In other words, saber rattling as a way of Hezbollah establishing itself as an actor working towards Lebanon’s benefit — so that when this deal comes, they shape their role in that way, that it was partly their pressure, their strong line on defending Lebanon’s interests that helped get Lebanon a deal.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hawkish regional watchers believe Nasrallah’s threats are laying the groundwork for an outbreak of conflict. Israel views Hezbollah as one of its greatest security threats and an arm of Iran’s greater ambitions to attack the Jewish state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Iranians, in their stomach, are trying to [take] revenge against Israel,” said Eitan Dangot, president of the Association of Oil and Gas Exploration Industries in Israel and former chief of the Israel Home Front Command. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Hezbollah is not working for the defense of Lebanon, Iran is giving it the green light to open its [missile] storage on Israel.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hezbollah’s determined threats against Israel is a point the Israel Defense Forces constantly reinforce to the world. The IDF has destroyed, but preserved, at least half a dozen Hezbollah tunnels dug under Israel’s northern border.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They regularly bring international visitors to tour the tunnels, marching them 80 meters, or more than 260 feet, underground to view the sophisticated engineering needed to burrow through solid bedrock and demonstrate what they say is Hezbollah’s determination to wage war on Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield visited the tunnels in November, and the IDF tweeted a photo of a delegation of ambassadors and diplomats visiting the tunnels in March.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‏”Seeing the tunnel with your own eyes changes your perception completely. Only then can you truly understand the lengths Hezbollah goes to in order to harm Israeli civilians,” Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, IDF international spokesperson, told The Hill. </p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3658893-five-things-republicans-would-do-in-a-house-majority/",
        "description": "<p>MONONGAHELA, Pa. — The sprint to Election Day is fully underway, but House Republicans are looking past November and eyeing what they’ll do in the likely event of winning a majority in the upper chamber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’ve hinted at parts of their agenda for months, but this week Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and other members of House GOP leadership formally unveiled a package of proposed policy and messaging priorities for the next Congress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarthy was joined by more than two dozen House GOP colleagues, with ideologies ranging from firebrand Freedom Caucus Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) to moderate Republican Governance Group Chairman David Joyce (R-Ohio), at the rollout event at warehouse for an HVAC company about 45 minutes outside Pittsburgh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Members answered friendly questions from some in the audience of around 150 parents, business owners, law enforcement officials and activists — with many news cameras and reporters watching. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dubbed the “Commitment to America,” much of the written plan is vague, vowing to \"curb wasteful government spending” and making a passing reference to abortion by saying the GOP will “protect the lives of unborn children and their mothers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the plan broadly lays out Republican priorities less than seven weeks before voters go to the polls. Republicans have also proposed some specifics and say other details would be worked out in committees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans need a net gain of just six seats to win control of the House in the Nov. 8 midterm elections, an outcome election analysts say is likely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are five things Republicans say they would do with that control:</p>\n\n\n\nTake aim at the IRS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The exterior of the Internal Revenue Service building in Washington is shown in this March 22, 2013 file photo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>House Republicans’ first bill, McCarthy announced at Friday’s rollout event, will aim to reverse the portion of the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law this summer, that provides $80 billion to the IRS and significantly boosts staff. The additional funds are largely to target high-income earner compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“On our very first bill, we're going to repeal 87,000 IRS agents,” McCarthy said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans have repeatedly, and falsely, claimed the 87,000 new IRS employees, which would be added over the course of a decade, will be “agents” and raised the specter of an enforcement army banging on voters’ doors. In fact, many will work as support staff, auditors and replacements for those who leave the agency.</p>\n\n\n\nLaunch a flood of investigations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>FILE - Evacuees wait to board a plane at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, Monday, Aug. 30. 2021. (Staff Sgt. Victor Mancilla/U.S. Marine Corps via AP, File)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the biggest tool for a GOP-led House with a Democratic president able to veto Republican bills would be the power to direct hearings and demand information and documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans promise to “conduct rigorous oversight to rein in government abuse of power and corruption” and flaunted that they have already sent more than 500 requests for information and documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They plan to investigate the Biden administration’s handling of the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, the origins of the COVID-19 virus — with several House Republicans pledging to specifically investigate Anthony Fauci, the chief medical adviser to Biden and longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — and policies on the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We will give [Homeland Security] Secretary Mayorkas a reserved parking spot, he will be testifying so much about this,” House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) also said that he would look into the Department of Justice (DOJ) as chair of the House Judiciary Committee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The No. 1 thing is this weaponization of the DOJ against the American people,” Jordan said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those actions could also affect the DOJ’s investigation of former President Trump. After the FBI executed a search warrant at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence and seized classified documents, Republicans told Attorney General Merrick Garland to preserve his documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans are also planning to probe the business activities of Hunter Biden, President Biden’s son, but lawmakers at the rollout event did not put focus on that.</p>\n\n\n\nWade into school culture war issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>People gather to protest against HB1041, a bill to ban transgender women and girls from participating in school sports that match their gender identity, during a rally at the Statehouse in Indianapolis, Wednesday, Feb. 9, 2022. (Associated Press)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarthy’s plan calls to \"defend fairness by ensuring that only women can compete in women’s sports,” and he has specifically said he would bring up the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That bill would to define sex “solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth” for purposes of Title IX in athletics. Support for the legislation ticked up as coverage of transgender athletes succeeding in women's sports competitions, such as former University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas, increased.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans also promise to “advance the Parents’ Bill of Rights,” legislation that was released last year in part as a response to frustrations about “woke” curriculum and COVID-19–related school closures that spilled over into heated school board meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill would require school districts to post curriculum publicly, have teachers offer two in-person meetings with parents a year, have parents give consent before any medical exam at school and provide notice of any violence at school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is unlikely that either bill could pass in the Senate, or that Biden would sign it.</p>\n\n\n\nPush domestic energy and gas production\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Domestic gas production has been a prominent issue for Republicans and one they are likely to continue to advocate for through legislation in a GOP-led House. (iStock)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans put a large focus on increasing domestic energy as a means of lowering fuel prices and increasing the number of well-paying jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform calls to “cut the permitting process time in half to reduce reliance on foreign countries.” House Republicans unveiled an energy and climate strategy earlier this year that promotes oil and gas, mining for critical minerals and hydropower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a GOP bill on climate makes it to Biden’s desk and he vetoes it, that would be future campaign fodder for Republicans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What kind of message does it send if it does get through to his desk and he has to veto it?” Rep. David Joyce (R-Ohio) told The Hill. “If that's a choice he wants to make, well then he won't win another term either.”</p>\n\n\n\nScrutinize local crime policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>House Republicans have vowed to introduce legislation that supports police departments across the country if they take the House. (Associated Press)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>High crime rates have been a major midterm campaign topic, and an NBC News poll released this week found the GOP with a 23-point edge over Democrats when voters were asked who could better handle the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans promise to bring up legislation to give recruiting and retention bonuses to police departments in hopes of combating national police staffing shortages. They also plan to probe policies of local district attorneys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“House Republicans will immediately ensure that we hire 200,000 more police officers across this country to make sure that our communities are safe,” said House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (N.Y.). “We will go after the radical leftist prosecutors, DAs, who are refusing to abide by the rule of law, and are prioritizing criminals rather than the law-abiding citizens.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The House passed four bills on Thursday that addressed policing, despite Democratic division.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Former President Trump has had one of his worst weeks on the legal front — and it is causing unease even among Republicans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most dramatic news was the suit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James that accuses Trump, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization of huge fraud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The case is civil, not criminal, but James is seeking a judgment of $250 million against the defendants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later the same day, a federal appeals court ruled against Trump in the dispute over sensitive documents seized by the FBI from his Mar-a-Lago estate in August. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The appellate court’s verdict gives investigators immediate access to around 100 documents that were marked as classified, rather than having to wait for a separate ruling from a court-appointed special master.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, a probe in Georgia is still not getting the level of national attention that its gravity merits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has told 17 people that they are targets of her investigation into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election result in the state. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among those facing the possibility of indictment is Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and Trump attorney.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Willis recently told The Washington Post that, if and when indictments are eventually issued, “people are facing prison sentences.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The political ramifications have begun to worry some Republicans — and not only those within the strident but thin anti-Trump ranks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The legal issues are motivating Trump’s base, who believe he’s being targeted by Democrats. But it’s not playing well with swing voters,” Dan Eberhart, a significant GOP donor, told this column.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eberhart, who donated around $100,000 to Trump’s 2020 reelection effort but has become more critical in the years since, added that the former president’s legal woes are complicating the midterm calculus for GOP candidates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Any candidate that tries to distance themselves from him over the legal stuff risks him attacking them and costing them base voters. It’s a mess,” Eberhart complained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sam Nunberg, who worked on the early stages of Trump’s 2016 campaign but has had a checkered relationship with him in the years since, viewed the recent developments through the prism of a possible 2024 bid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nunberg said Trump appeared to get a “bump” of sympathetic support among some Republicans in the wake of the Mar-a-Lago raid but it appears to have subsided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I just can’t see the Republican Party nominating someone who lost the previous election, could only serve one term, and is under multiple investigations and possible indictments — especially when there is an obvious alternative,” Nunberg said, referring to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump also deepened GOP dismay when he made the bizarre claim, during a Wednesday evening interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News, that a president could declassify secret documents by “thinking about it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least four GOP senators, including Senate Republican Whip John Thune (S.D.) dissented from that view in separate comments to CNN reporter Manu Raju.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has responded to his various legal setbacks with rage — often a sign that the former president is feeling the pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reacting to the suit filed in New York, Trump described James, who is Black, as a “racist” and a “fraud.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In relation to Georgia, the former president took aim at Willis soon after her comments about “jail sentences.” He complained that Willis was trying to “prosecute a very popular president” and was engaged in “a strictly political Witch Hunt!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no good time for the kind of grim legal news Trump has received this week — but right now is particularly bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former president is edging closer to declaring his 2024 candidacy, holding rallies in recent weeks in Pennsylvania and Ohio. The events were ostensibly to help GOP candidates in those states but, in practice, looked like rallies for a coming Trump campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump’s primacy within the GOP is also coming under new challenge, especially from DeSantis. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Florida governor has been holding public events far from his native state in recent weeks. And the flights of migrants he organized from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts have proven popular with the right-wing populist base that dominates today's GOP, even though DeSantis's gambit is deeply contentious with the general public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In tandem, there is nervousness in Republican circles about the state of the midterms campaign. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months back, the GOP was confident of sweeping gains in both chambers of Congress. Now, the battle for the Senate tilts slightly toward Democrats, while expectations for GOP gains in the House have become more modest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) recent observation about the importance of “candidate quality,” was widely seen as a jab at Trump-endorsed Senate nominees such as Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania and Herschel Walker in Georgia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump’s poll ratings rarely shift but they have eroded slightly in some polls amid the blizzard of bad news. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An NBC News survey released last Sunday found just 34 percent of registered voters holding a favorable view of the former president. It was his lowest rating in that poll since April 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democrats, for their part, can hardly contain their delight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Nobody in any sort of swing state is embracing Donald Trump as they would have 12 months ago,” said Dick Harpootlian, a prominent Democrat and state senator in South Carolina who also served on President Biden’s fundraising committee during the 2020 campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It is not just the legal difficulties, it is the election-denying. Beyond the My Pillow guy, that is not seen as a normal or rational position,” he added, referring to fervent Trump ally Mike Lindell. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Trump lost the election. He can’t get past that, his people can’t get past that. But the American public has got past that,” Harpootlian said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Leaders of the G7 condemned the “sham” Russian referendums being carried out in occupied Ukraine as a “phony” pretext to illegally grab territory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement on Friday evening, the group of the wealthiest nations said that the votes organized by Moscow were in breach of the U.N. Charter and international law and had no legitimacy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia started on Friday asking people in the regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia if they wanted to join Russia, in an attempt to formalize the annexation of the four areas. The self-styled referendums will take place over five days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. called out Russia’s “blatant intimidation of local populations” who have “consistently resisted Russian efforts to change borders by force.” Armed soldiers have been going door-to-door to gather votes, according to media reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday denounced the Moscow-initiated votes as a “farce.” He also asked residents of the occupied regions to hide from Russia’s mobilization “by any means,” after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced this week that 300,000 reservists would be called up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia is likely to use the referendums to claim that Russian territory is being attacked with NATO weaponry. “That’s exactly what we need to be prepared for, that Russia will use these sham votes to further escalate the war in Ukraine,” he told CNN on Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“NATO’s answer is to step up support,”Stoltenberg said. “The best way to end this war is to strengthen Ukrainians on the battlefield further, so they can at some stage sit down and reach a solution which is acceptable for Ukraine and preserves Ukraine as a sovereign independent nation in Europe.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The referendums come as the U.N. said on Friday that Russia had committed war crimes in Ukraine including the bombings of civil areas, summary executions, torture and sexual violence including against children. Investigators visited 27 Ukrainian towns and settlements and interviewed over 150 victims and witnesses, it said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We were struck by a large number of executions and other violations by Russian forces, and the Commission received consistent accounts of torture and ill-treatment,” the investigators said in the report. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Oil, the State, and War: The Foreign Policies of Petrostates, by Emma Ashford, Georgetown University Press, 365 pages, $34.95</p>\n<p>It doesn't take a Ph.D. to see that oil drives conflict. Just looking at the recent history of America's interventions in the Middle East will do.</p>\n<p>During the Tanker War of the 1980s, the U.S. Navy fought Iran to protect Iraq's oil. Then, during the first Gulf War, the U.S. military fought Iraq to protect Kuwait and Saudi Arabia's oil. After three decades of war in Iraq, the United States came full circle, with the Trump administration threatening Iran while Iran threatened Saudi Arabia's oil.</p>\n<p>Less understood is how oil drives conflict. The popular view, espoused both by many anti-war critics and by violence enthusiasts like former President Donald Trump, is that larger countries go to war to steal the oil wealth of smaller ones. Strong consumers take what they can; weak producers provide what they must.</p>\n<p>Emma Ashford, a foreign policy scholar at the Stimson Center, makes the opposite claim in Oil, the State, and War. It isn't the need for cheap energy that drives foreign policy, she argues; it's the economics of energy production that make petrostates more trigger-happy. On one hand, control over energy markets removes constraints on warmaking. On the other hand, the \"resource curse\" warps political institutions. And of course, oil money helps governments buy fancy weapons.</p>\n<p>Oil is unique in how it influences state behavior. Like many other natural resources, petroleum is scarce and expensive. Unlike those other resources, oil is necessary for the world economy to keep running. And all oil is bought and sold on the same global market, priced in U.S. dollars, meaning a change anywhere affects prices everywhere.</p>\n<p>But not every petrostate is created equal. Oil plays a very different role in Saudi, Norwegian, Iranian, and Mexican societies. While most countries have put their oil resources under government control since the mid-20th century, the United States—the world's largest oil producer—has a private and competitive oil industry.</p>\n<p>Rather than discussing petrostates as one bloc, Ashford draws three overlapping categories of oil producers. In oil-dependent states, a large chunk of government revenue is tied up in the petroleum sector. Oil-wealthy states earn a significant amount of income, whether or not they depend on it, from oil production. Finally, super-producers and super-exporters control a substantial percentage of the global oil market.</p>\n<p>An oil-dependent nation is the classic image of a petrostate. Rather than providing services to earn the trust of taxpayers, leaders manage a firehose of unearned income, which they use to buy loyalty or pay for the tools of repression. Many scholars have theorized how the \"resource curse\" damages a country's political culture. Ashford skillfully illustrates those theories with specific, detailed examples of Saudi and pre-2003 Iraqi government dysfunction.</p>\n<p>Timothy Mitchell's 2011 book Carbon Democracy contrasts coal-based labor unions' successes in Europe with worker power's failure in societies that are dependent on oil income. In the latter societies, he argues, it is hard for ordinary people to inflict pain on elites, which slows democratic development. Ashford makes a similar argument about the private sector, suggesting that the lack of a business lobby in oil-dependent countries quashes dissent within the ranks of the elite.</p>\n<p>Ashford also delves into how great powers use military aid and protection for dictators as a form of \"indirect control\" over oil-producing states. Yet her book does not ask an obvious follow-up question: Does foreign intervention have an effect on the \"resource curse\"? The history of U.S.- and U.K.-sponsored coups in the Middle East certainly suggests that it does. When powerful outsiders are interested in local political disputes, it tends to inflame those disputes.</p>\n<p>Where Ashford excels is linking the effects of the oil curse to producers' foreign policy processes. Oil dependency concentrates power in the hands of small cliques or single dictators. It discourages the development of diplomatic institutions or intelligence agencies that can provide those leaders with good advice.</p>\n<p>Unlike politicians in democratic republics or even well-developed one-party states, petro-tyrants like Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman or Iraq's Saddam Hussein have been free to act on their wildest impulses. And oil-rich states, dependent or not, have a glut of free money they can spend on large militaries. In fact, Ashford found that high oil prices correlate to increased levels of military spending on a global level. She suggests they have a similar impact on proxy warfare, when states like Iran fund foreign militants or allied countries to do their bidding.</p>\n<p>Saudi Arabia's purchases of American-made arms and support for militant groups might be the most infamous example. (Iran was also a major customer for American weapons before an anti-American government took power in 1979.) Russia dumped so much cash into military \"modernization\" during the last decade, Ashford observes, that \"it was near-impossible for Russia's defense sector to absorb the spending.\" In Carbon Democracy, Mitchell argues that Britain, the Soviet Union, and, above all, the United States were willing to feed petrostates' weapon addiction as a way to keep them using pounds sterling, rubles, or dollars.</p>\n<p>Powerful military capabilities are a dangerous temptation for trigger-happy leaders. Iraq and Libya, for example, repeatedly attacked their neighbors. Americans themselves are quite familiar with how a large army makes politicians more eager to go to war.</p>\n<p>Armies bloated by oil money also become a source of fear for non-oil-rich neighbors, who build up their own forces in an attempt to keep up. Although neither Israel or Turkey export oil, the cold war between oil-rich Saudi Arabia and Iran has sucked them in all the same.</p>\n<p>The combination of oil wealth and oil dependence is especially toxic. Petrostates buy flashy new toys when oil markets are booming, then end up in debt when oil prices fall. The same effect applies to oil-funded social spending, as Venezuela demonstrates. As Ashford puts it, any government spending in an oil-wealthy or oil-dependent state is \"a bet on the future price of oil.\"</p>\n<p>The resource curse is not \"solely responsible for poor foreign policy decisions,\" Ashford writes. But in many cases, it clearly contributes to \"a chaotic and generally poor foreign policy process.\"</p>\n<p>Oil is most directly linked to foreign policy when it comes to super-producers and super-exporters. Again, because all oil is sold on the same market, changes in supply anywhere affect prices everywhere.</p>\n<p>Turning market effects into political leverage is harder than it seems. The one big historical example of the \"oil weapon\" is the 1973 oil embargo, when Arab states decided to punish international supporters of Israel by cutting oil supplies. While American consumers suffered shortages, which were severely exacerbated by the U.S. government's attempts at price controls, the embargo failed to force Israel or its supporters to make any policy changes. Arab leaders gave up after they realized they were hurting their own economic interests more than anything else.</p>\n<p>Russia has been more successful at coercing its neighbors using natural gas, because Soviet-era pipe infrastructure and the fragmented nature of gas markets give Moscow power over supply chains. Even so, this blackmail has undermined Russia's economic power by encouraging Europe to look for alternative energy suppliers.</p>\n<p>Beyond their practical impact, the 1973 crisis and the Russian threats have had a psychological effect, making politicians in rich countries obsessed with energy security. While the \"oil weapon\" is ineffective in reality, Ashford argues, politicians' belief in the danger of oil embargos has given energy producers much more clout—an effect she calls \"soft oil power\"—and driven international powers to offer their protection to oil producers.</p>\n<p>In the 1980s, the small petrostate of Kuwait backed an Iraqi invasion of Iran by opening its ports (and a financial lifeline) to Iraq. When Iran retaliated by attacking Kuwaiti shipping, Kuwait extracted promises of protection from both the Soviet Union and the United States. Thus began a four-decade stretch of U.S. military intervention in the Persian Gulf.</p>\n<p>The world may have passed what Ashford calls its \"peak petrostate\" era. Technological advances such as fracking have opened up new petroleum sources outside of traditional oil-producing regions. At the same time, the fight against climate change has prompted industrialized countries to move toward less carbon-intensive energy sources.</p>\n<p>So the trend is toward an economy that does not value or rely on petroleum products as much. But the damage done by oil-fueled rulers may last much longer.</p>\n<p>The post Are We Past 'Peak Petrostate'? appeared first on Reason.com.</p>",

Two decades on, the stories still have the power to astonish</p><p>I can say precisely where and when I first read Black England because I made a note of it on the flyleaf: Zadie Smith NW2 ’99. <br />I was in the habit back then of using the books I bought as a record of the places and times of my life. Can’t remember what I hoped to gain by it – but I am grateful now to recall that I must have been back in my mum’s flat in Willesden Green, north-west London, and finishing my first novel. And if I was doing that, I must have bought Black England in Willesden Bookshop (now defunct) with a song in my heart. In order to write White Teeth, I was having to try to convince myself day after day, in what felt like a vacuum, that such an entity as “Black England” or “Black and Brown England” actually existed – and was worth writing a comic novel about. It’s incredible to think of now, but by 1999 I’d gone through 15 years of formal education, including a three-year English degree, without ever being given a book to study that made any reference whatsoever to the presence of individuals like me in the country in which I was born. Not a novel, not a history book. Nothing. Anything I read in that direction I had to either find myself, or rely on my enterprising mother to find. It was usually easier for both of us to work by analogy, and read things about our American diaspora cousins. So we generally did that. But here it was: Black England! And not a novel! History!</p><p>Into my perfect ignorance poured all these remarkable facts. Some were just delicious because I could hardly believe they were true: “By 1596 there were so many black people in England that Queen Elizabeth I issued an edict demanding that they leave.”</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Dan Brink\n    \n\n  <p>A second try at No. 61 fell short for Judge.</p> <p>Welcome back to the Aaron Judge Home Run Record Tracker! We’re taking a daily look at where Aaron Judge’s monster season tracks compared to some of the other historic single-season home run leaders in anticipation of Judge potentially joining their ranks. We’ll be going by Team Game because not every player’s seasons were in sync with the calendar days and everyone didn’t play all of the team’s games, which makes this our universal standard. Let’s run through Game 150:</p>\nAaron Judge through Game 150 of 2022: 60 HR\n<p>Team Game 150: 9/23 — 1-for-4, 2 K</p>\n<p>Not every day can be a smashing success, even when you’re hitting better than anyone else on the planet. Judge was tested in this game more than in the series opener, but the Sox managed to avoid any major damage from the MVP favorite. He did launch a ball up in the air out to left field, but just like his fly out from yesterday the baseball decided that 100+ mph was not enough to get it to leave the park. Instead, it landed harmlessly in Tommy Pham’s glove on the warning track and Judge had to settle for a late single to preserve his batting average lead in pursuit of the Triple Crown.</p>\nRoger Maris through Game 150 of 1961: 56 HR\n<p>Team Game 150: 9/15 (2) — 1-for-4, 1 R</p>\n<p>Not much to report on from Maris in this one, as he got on base with a single in the eighth and later scored on an error that cut the Yankees’ deficit to two. Unfortunately, Maris wasn’t able to get aboard in any of his other three at-bats and the Yankees couldn’t push across any more runs after they were gifted that second one.</p>\nBabe Ruth through Game 150 of 1927: 56 HR\n<p>Team Game 150: 9/24 — 2-for-4, 1 BB, 2 K, 1 SB</p>\n<p>We’re nearing the end of Ruth’s time on our tracker, and he’s still a few home runs short of his eventual total. That means he’s due for a run on bombs, but he didn’t get any in this outing — instead, he slapped a couple singles off of a pitcher who unironically was called Lil Stoner, worked a walk late in the game, and even managed to swipe a bag.</p>\nBarry Bonds through Game 150 of 2001: 66 HR\n<p>Team Game 150: 9/23 — 2-for-4, 2 HR, 2 RBI, 3 R, 1 BB, 1 SB</p>\n<p>Bonds had a fantastic start to this day, working a walk as part of a first inning where the Giants sent their entire lineup to the plate before stepping up in the second and fourth innings to hit a pair of dingers. The two-homer night further cemented his lead on McGwire’s pace and pushed him into striking distance of the all-time record.</p>\n\nMark McGwire through Game 150 of 1998: 62 HR\n<p>Team Game 150: 9/13 — 0-for-2</p>\n<p>McGwire’s leap to 62 was a week ago by this point, but the slugger was still plateaued on this mark when he played against the Astros. Big Mac’s historic push past Maris left him a little deflated, and it didn’t help that he left this game after just two at-bats in the fifth inning when the Cardinals made some defensive swaps. McGwire’s cold streak would last a couple more games, but that left the door open for a certain someone ...</p>\nSammy Sosa through Game 150 of 1998: 62 HR\n<p>Team Game 150: 9/13 — 2-for-4, 2 HR, 3 RBI, 3 R, 1 BB, 1 K</p>\n<p>When McGwire opened up a four-homer lead after Game 145 of the season, even though there was some time left in the year it seemed like this was the burst that would finally separate these two in what had been an extraordinary race. Fast forward just a few days later, and Sosa brought himself right back into the running with a double-homer day to cap off his third straight game with a long ball.</p>\n<p>Just like in the team’s previous game, this was a barn burner, only this time the Cubs were the ones with the big lead trying to hold on. Sosa was a big part of getting that lead, thanks to his first blast coming in the fifth inning to push the Cubs up 8-2. The Brewers would proceed to score eight runs by the ninth inning to claim the lead though, adding at least one run in each of the next four frames. Sosa kept his team alive with a mammoth solo shot to bring it to 7-8, and his teammates managed to scratch across another to push it to extras and ultimately win the game in 10 innings.</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, those are some major bombs — and they announced that he was very much still in the race. The two were so neck and neck throughout the year that this isn’t even the penultimate time that they would tie each other, and there was only 12 games left at this point! 1998 was truly a wild year for baseball.</p>",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/how-to-remove-yourself-from-google-messages-group-chats",
        "description": "<p>Recently, I’ve been added to several group chats that I did ask to be a part of but have since changed my mind on. Another chat I’m somehow in I most certainly did not ask to be included, yet I am anyway. Google Messages is a wonderful app, but it does have a lot of things it needs to work out. While it’s gaining new features each month, it still lacks in some basics like removing yourself from group chats effectively. Today, I’m going to show you how to stop all of these unwanted communications.</p>\n\n\n\nMuting group chat notifications\n\n\n\n<p>Oddly enough, Messages by Google simply does not have a “leave group chat” button for MMS chats (it does for standard RCS chats!), so we’re going to have to use a workaround here. Actually, we’re going to have to abuse the tools a little bit, and you’ll soon see why. The first thing you’ll want to do to stop being pinged incessantly is to open the group chat you want to make vanish and tap the three vertical dots at the top-right corner of the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will pop open a context menu full of choices. Tap “Mute notifications”. You’ll be taken to a screen where it shows that notifications are currently set to “Default”. Tap “Silent” instead. You can also scroll down and toggle the “Pop on screen”, “Show notification dot”, and “Vibration” options. Additionally, there’s a “Not a conversation” button at the bottom that will remove it from the conversation section. I would recommend simply archiving the group chat after this process instead of tapping this last one though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pro Tip: You can also find these options by simple pressing and holding the group chat from the main messages list!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbusing Google’s tools for lack of a better option\n\n\n\n<p>Tap the back button at the top-left of the screen and you’ll be taken back to the group message in question. From here, simply tap the vertical three dots once more and tap “Group details”. Remember when I said we’re going to abuse the system a little bit? Well, we’re at that part and it’s Google’s fault for not providing a simpler out for you. Tap “Report spam” and then tap the same thing again on the dialogue box that pops up. This will force the chat to go to the “Spam &amp; blocked” section of the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pro Tip: Archiving the group chat without reporting it as spam – even if you’ve disabled all notifications – will sometimes cause it to return to your messages list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, just like that, the group chat has been banished to the shadow realm! You may now carry on with your day and enjoy the peace and quiet. I find it appalling that Google doesn’t simply have the aforementioned “Leave group chat” button and Support threads have complained about it since 2019 or earlier. If the company wants others to adopt RCS (even though Apple won’t) then it’s going to need to step up its game a whole lot.</p>\n\n\n\nI just want the instructions!\n\n\n\n<p>1. Tap the group chat you want to banish to the shadow realm</p><p>2. Tap the vertical three dots at the top-right<br />3. Choose “Group details” and then “Notifications”<br />4. Select “Silent”, and toggle “Show notification dot” and other options below<br />5. Tap the back arrow at the top-left of the screen and go back to the group details<br />6. Go to “Report spam” and confirm the dialogue box<br />7. Sleep easy!</p>\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Lina, second from right.\n<p>By Lina Zinecker</p>\n<p>In 2015 I decided to move to New York from Hamburg, Germany to study acting at The American Musical and Dramatic Academy (AMDA), located on the Upper West Side.</p>\n<p>I knew pretty early on that I wanted to study acting in New York, since it’s the art capital of the world and I grew up watching American movies and tv series. After taking part in an acting summer workshop at The New York Film Academy in 2014, I noticed how much more hands on the training was over here, and decided to apply to different acting schools in the United States.</p>\n<p>What I like about the UWS is that it’s home to so many acting, dance, and music schools. Plus, we have the MET opera and Lincoln Center here. You’re surrounded by art wherever you go, and I constantly run into fellow performers!</p>\n<p>One of my favorite things about the Upper West Side, New York City, and the acting community has been that I get to meet fellow artists from all over the world and bond over our love for this city and the arts. There hasn’t been a show, since I started working here, where I was the only foreigner in the cast. I love being able to be creative and learn from other performers and come together to create a play or film.</p>\n<p>Being from a different country doesn’t only give me the opportunity to share my culture, but also to get to know so many others.</p>\n<p>It’s very interesting to be shown foreign music and films and see what is popular somewhere else. Although most of the time I don’t understand the language, if the acting is done well you still get a good idea of what the scene is about. Art in some ways doesn’t even need to be translated — the tonality, facial expressions, and gestures carry emotions way more than one might think.</p>\n<p>What I’ve noticed is that there is an unspoken and immediate bond between foreign performers/people whenever we meet each other. We instantly understand what it’s like to be thousands of miles away from home, to not be able to talk to friends and family whenever we feel like it due to time differences, and to create a new friend group for ourselves in a new country.</p>\n“You can have lots of fun, while still being professional.”\n<p>Working in the arts in New York has also taught me that you can have lots of fun, while still being professional. Whenever I’ve worked in Germany everyone on set/at the theater was very stern — even a bit intimidating and cold at times. Over here I’ve noticed that directors and producers are much more open and engaging, but that attitude doesn’t take anything away from their professionalism. That’s something that I truly value.</p>\n<p>Having the luxury of living in this one-of-a kind city has also provided me with the opportunity to consume art weekly. Broadway shows, off-off Broadway plays, sketch comedy and improv shows are happening daily all throughout the boroughs. If you feel like it, you can literally show hop nightly. That’s not something we have where I’m from. Going to see a show is something you only do once in a while in Hamburg. We don’t have anything comparable to Broadway, where you can find one theater next to the other. We usually have three or four musicals and those stay for a long time, so there isn’t much variety compared to over here. To have the chance to see a different show whenever I want to is extremely exciting. Plus, there are so many pop-up art events happening all of the time in the city that there is no time to ever feel uninspired, or bored.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>I also like that there are a lot of ways to further your craft here. The amount of acting, improv, dance, and singing classes that regularly take place blew my mind when I first moved to New York. I consider myself fortunate to have met so many incredibly talented people not only on stage, but also while taking classes. The adrenaline rush you feel while performing together and sharing that experience really makes you bond in a different way.</p>\n<p>I genuinely consider New York City my home. The way that I have grown here as a performer and human would not have been possible anywhere else. This city means the world to me, and anybody who’s ever lived here knows that no other place can compare!</p>\nImprov performance at The People‘s Improv Theater Loft.",

Republican small-dollar fund-raising has dried up in the face of soaring inflation. Former President Donald Trump’s relentless appeals for his own committees have siphoned cash that would typically go to candidates or party committees. And the party’s novice Senate nominees lack the sort of wealthy donor networks that more experienced candidates have nurtured for years.”</p>",

Plus a word on Weir and MacMillan</p><p>Self-belief, urgent and impassioned, burst forth from Welsh National Opera’s new staging of Leoš Janáček’s The Makropulos Affair (1926), directed by Olivia Fuchs and conducted by Tomáš Hanus. Confidence is the elusive key to any performance, the magnet that draws you in. We may expect it from a professional opera company, but Janáček’s penultimate opera lays every obstacle in its path, from complications with the source material, to the text-heavy Czech libretto, to the nature of the opera itself.</p><p>WNO, however, is a company immersed in this composer, through recent exposure – lately, Jenůfa and The Cunning Little Vixen – and through history. The Janáček pioneer Charles Mackerras was a one-time WNO music director. The current holder of the post, Hanus, was born in Brno in the Czech Republic, the town where Janáček spent most of his life.

Eddie Cicotte got the win. Shoeless Joe Jackson’s double in the ninth drove in the game- and pennant-clinching run. The Sox would beat out Cleveland by 3 1⁄2 games for the title, and finish with a record of 88-52 in the war-shortened season.  </p>\n\n1961\n<p>White Sox star pitcher Billy Pierce won his 186th and final game with the team, as he threw 6 2⁄3 innings in relief in an 8-7 win over Baltimore.

He represented the Sox in seven All-Star games and started three of them for the American League — a White Sox record for pitchers.</p>\n\n1969\n<p>White Sox owner Art Allyn sold the club to his brother John Allyn, thwarting moves made by Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt and Milwaukee’s Bud Selig to buy the team. Hunt wanted to move the White Sox to Dallas, Selig to Milwaukee.</p>\n\n1977\n<p>White Sox infielder Jack Brohamer had the game of his life, as he became just the second player in franchise history to hit for the cycle in a game.

He homered in the first, doubled in the third, doubled in the fifth, singled in the sixth and tripled in the ninth inning.</p>\n<p>The only other cycle in White Sox history had come from Ray Schalk in 1922.</p>\n\n2000\n<p>Despite losing to the Twins at the Metrodome, the White Sox clinched the AL Central when Cleveland lost to the Royals, 9-0.

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/logi-cloud-overpriced-but-not-thoughtless",
        "description": "<p>Recently, a new gaming handheld from Logitech leaked online, and since then, it’s become public knowledge that the company has put together a fairly decent package for those looking to play AAA-quality cloud games. The device also plays Google Play Games, meaning that anyone who goes this route will have plenty of great stuff to play (as soon as Google helps users determine which games are controller friendly!)</p>\n\n\n\nI’m not saying this thing isn’t expensive\n\n\n\n<p>Another tidbit has become public knowledge, and you’re probably already aware that the Logi Cloud, as it’s being called, is being priced at a whopping $349 USD upon launch! For those keeping track, that’s exactly fifty bucks cheaper than the base model Steam Deck – a device that’s much more locally capable of on-device gaming with much more impressive specs. Where does Logitech get off thinking they can charge Valve pricing for what is essentially a handheld that relies almost entirely on the cloud for its value proposition? The internet is in a tizzy over this, and I don’t blame them. However, I have a controversial take today (and no, this is not sponsored) – I don’t think that Logi’s pricing for this thing is entirely wild when you consider the future of gaming. It’s just insensitive to the current state of it and consumer perception. Let’s be honest though, someone was eventually going to take that step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that the Logi Cloud isn’t expensive. Most people only buy a $350 game console once every seven years when the new PlayStation or Xbox comes out, and even then, the price-to-value ratio has to be extremely high. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, my thoughts on game console generations aside, I still don’t believe that this thing is for everyone. In fact, I believe that it’s a halo product – just like Google’s Pixelbook was. Most people didn’t buy it, it was considered a commercial failure compared to competing Chromebooks, and its price tag was a gate to make sure that only those interested in exploring what the future had to offer would make the investment. It was simply created to light the way for other hardware creators, set the standard for what the future should look like, and unlock the possibilities.</p>\n\n\n\nRemember when everyone laughed at Chromebooks?\n\n\n\n<p>I remember back when Chromebooks first came out and people were up in a rage that someone would even pay for a piece of hardware that essentially didn’t even count as a local computer. Some people would even tell me that Chromebooks were essentially just empty shells with a web browser. With that being said, they couldn’t understand why they would even cost more than the hardware took to make in the factory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Times have certainly changed, and local computing isn’t the only kid on the block anymore. ChromeOS has since proven the naysayers wrong, stolen a huge laptop market share percentage, and is the only category that continued to grow during the pandemic. Downloadable software is no longer the only means to getting work done, and in many cases, is valued less than websites and web applications – Adobe Suite, game engines, and proprietary legacy software aside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re entering a new era of computing, and the cloud is widely accepted as having a better value proposition than it used to. Most people simply consider Chrome and other browsers along with their web apps the way of life. We’re even beginning to come to a place where premium Chromebook pricing is acceptable, and many users are willing to pay that premium for a good piece of hardware that runs nothing but cloud software – wild, huh?</p>\n\n\n\nMainstream value in ownership will change, even if we fight it\n\n\n\n<p>Logitech’s Cloud gaming handheld certainly is overpriced for the current state of gaming where most people still value local storage and game ownership. However, as I consider the journey that Chromebooks have been on for the past decade and as cloud gaming becomes more accepted into the mainstream, more reliable, and permeates culture on a grander scale, I do believe that people will eventually be willing to pay $350 for a Steam Deck-like handheld that plays PC or console-quality titles. Games are just going through the same metamorphosis that non-gaming software has over the past ten years. I also believe that for the average consumer (like it or not), it will become the status quo and a way of life for gamers. It will be accepted as “just the way it is”, even if those of us who are passionate about gaming will fight until our dying breath for the opposite (Besides, this thing will be great for retro emulation!)</p>\n\n\n\nCloud gaming just has a dedicated body now\n\n\n\n<p>For this very reason, I don’t see local hardware-powered gaming disappearing in the immediate future, and cloud gaming will become and remain a mainstream thing that lives alongside good old-fashioned game consoles. The only difference is that cloud gaming now has a dedicated hardware body, which yes, seems contradictory, but inevitable. Let me know if you agree or disagree in the comments. I’m fully aware that this is a spicy take, but I’m a futurist and a forward thinker, despite the fact that it often pisses people off.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogi Cloud specs\n\n\n\nSoC: Qualcomm Snapdragon 720GDisplay: 7″ 1920 x 1080 IPS display with a 60Hz refresh rateRAM: 4GBBattery: 12+ hoursWeight: 1.02 lbsPorts: 3.5 mm headphone jack, USB-C 3.1Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.1, 5GHz Wi-Fi ACOther features: Stereo speaker and haptic feedbackPrice: $349.99 USD ($299 USD during pre-order)Release date: October 2022\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "As usual, September has been a very busy month for Apple. The company released the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple Watch Series 8, and a new Apple Watch SE last week, followed by the Apple Watch Ultra and new AirPods Pro this week. On the software side, Apple released iOS 16, watchOS 9, and tvOS 16.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll attention now turns to October and beyond, with rumors suggesting that Apple still has a lot on its schedule through the end of 2022. Below, we have put together a list of some of the bigger announcements to expect from Apple later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 14 Plus Launch\r<br />\nWhile the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max launched on September 16, the iPhone 14 Plus is available starting October 7. Apple did not provide a reason for the staggered release, but the iPhone 14 Plus is a brand new option in the lineup and will become the first non-Pro model with a large 6.7-inch display ever sold.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKey new features of the iPhone 14 Plus include car crash detection, upcoming support for emergency texting via satellite in the U.S. and Canada, longer battery life, improved cameras, and a more repairable design with a removable back glass panel. The device is powered by the same A15 Bionic chip with a five-core GPU as in the iPhone 13 Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe only differences between the iPhone 14 Plus and the smaller 6.1-inch iPhone 14 relate to display size, battery life, weight, and price.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 16.1 With Live Activities and More\r<br />\nApple said iOS 16.1 will be released later this year. The software update will include several new features for the iPhone, such as Live Activities support in third-party apps, a Clean Energy Charging option in the United States, support for Matter accessories in the Home app, Apple Fitness+ workouts without an Apple Watch, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's not yet clear if iOS 16.1 will include features like iCloud Shared Photo Library and the new Freeform digital whiteboard app that Apple says will be available later this year. iOS 16.2 will likely be released in December with any remaining features promised.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Event in October\r<br />\nApple often holds an October event to announce new iPad and Mac models, and this year will likely be no exception. Given how early the September event was this year, the next event could be held in early October, but timing remains to be seen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor the October event, rumors suggest that Apple plans to announce new iPad Pro models with the M2 chip, a redesigned 10th-generation entry-level iPad, and at least a few more Macs powered by the M2 series of chips. A new Mac Pro is almost certain by the end of 2022, while new MacBook Pro and Mac mini models are also possible.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPadOS 16 and macOS Ventura Release Dates\r<br />\nApple says iPadOS 16 and macOS Ventura will be released to the general public in October. Apple will likely announce exact release dates for the software updates either during its October event or immediately afterwards.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPadOS 16 was expected to be released in September alongside iOS 16, but Apple delayed the software update until October, likely to focus on making improvements to Stage Manager after some users criticized the feature's various shortcomings. Apple said the software update will be labeled iPadOS 16.1 instead of iPadOS 16.0.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Music Classical\r<br />\nIn August 2021, Apple announced the acquisition of classical music service Primephonic. At the time, Apple said it planned to launch a dedicated classical music app in 2022 that combined Primephonic's user interface with additional features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFew details are known about the dedicated Apple Music Classical app or when it might launch, but it should be coming soon as 2022 draws to a close.<br />This article, \"Here's What Else to Expect From Apple Later This Year\" first appeared on MacRumors.com<br /><br />Discuss this article in our forums<br /><br />",

Shaw/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Braves Franchise History\n<p>1939 - Boston Bees outfielder Johnny Cooney hits his first home run after 15 years as a major league player. Cooney will homer again the next day which will be his final home run in his 20-year career. </p>\n<p>1965 - Tony Cloninger throws a four-hitter to give the Braves an 8-2 win over the Giants. </p>\n<p>1968 - Hank and Tommie Aaron pull off a double steal for the Braves. The two combine for seven hits in a 7-3 win over the Mets. New York manager Gil Hodges suffered a heart attack during the game and is hospitalized. Rube Walker will serve as manager for the remainder of the season. </p>\n<p>1980 - The Braves beat the Astros 4-2 at Fulton County Stadium and go over the one million mark in attendance for the season. It is the first season ever in which all of the teams in one league have drawn at least one million in attendance. </p>\n<p>1983 - Dale Murphy becomes the sixth player in major league history to join the 30/30 club when he walks, steals second and then scores the winning run on a Rafael Ramirez single in a 3-2 win over the Dodgers. </p>\nMLB History\n<p>1911 - The Cardinals score a run in the sixth inning to snap a 41 scoreless inning streak by Grover Alexander. </p>\n<p>1920 - Babe Ruth hits his 50th home run of the season in the first inning of a twinbill against the Senators. Ruth adds his 51st in the second game and goes 4-for-4 while helping the Yankees to a 2-1 win. </p>\n<p>1921 - Ty Cobb challenges umpire Billy Evans to a fight. George Hildebrand, who was the second umpire assigned to the game, reports the incident to American League president Ban Johnson. After Johnson fails to act, Commissioner Landis suspends Cobb, but allows him to continue as a non-playing manager. </p>\n<p>1932 - Jimmie Foxx hits his second grand slam in three days, giving him 57 home runs for the season but the A’s fall to Washington, 8-7. </p>\n<p>1975 - Chicago’s Joe Wallis hits a two-out single in the ninth inning to break up a no-hit bid by Tom Seaver. Seaver retires the next hitter and the game headed to extra innings scoreless. The Cubs will win the game in the 11th. </p>\n\n<p>Information for this article was found via Baseball Reference, NationalPastime.com and Today in Baseball History.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "Photo by Matthew Stockman/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Colorado Rockies news and links for Saturday, September 24, 2022 </p> <p>Mired in their fourth straight losing season, the Colorado Rockies have tested the patience of their fans in recent years. A huge payday to Kris Bryant in the off-season has kicked-off to a truly terrible start, they’re pacing for one of the worst road records in franchise history and the offense has been generally anemic, especially by Coors Field standards. </p>\n<p>But while the product on the field of 20th and Blake has shown little to no improvement, there has been progress behind the scenes. </p>\n<p>It started with the Fresno Grizzlies’ 2021 roster, featuring top prospects Drew Romo, Ezequiel Tovar and Zac Veen. While Romo and Veen stuck around for playoff-push in Fresno that season, Tovar jumped up to High-A Spokane in August despite being nearly four years younger than the league average and has been rising ever since.</p>\n<p>A new core has started to form, and with each passing game the Colorado Rockies’ dreams have gotten closer to becoming reality. José Iglesias was already signed-on as a place-holder at shortstop — a position that has been filled by homegrown products for a very long time — but the plan was clear: Tovar was the future of the position and the front office wasn’t afraid to admit it. </p>\n<p>Becoming the next great homegrown shortstop are lofty expectations being placed on “Tovi”, but so far he seems confident in his abilities to handle it: “Oh no, no pressure at all. I just want to go out there and be the best version of myself and go out there and play as best as I can.”</p>\n<p>He isn’t the only farmhand General Manager Bill Schmidt has sung praise of this year. Former first-round pick Michael Toglia had been discussed at length as he climbed through the upper-levels of the minors. Schmidt even went so far as to mention him in the same breath as Colorado legend Todd Helton. </p>\n<p>Toglia got the call and made his debut at the end of August. And now, so has Tovar, going 2-for-4 in his first taste of the big leagues on Friday.</p>\n\n\n<p>Ezequiel Tovar<br />First Major League AB<br />First Major League hit pic.twitter.com/EsBrq2eRJ8</p>— RoxGifsVids (@RoxGifsVids) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Tovar’s arrival is important for a number of reasons, most notable being the opportunity earned in his development. </p>\n<p>While there is still refinement needed in his game – mainly in his plate discipline and pitch selection – his defense has been big-league ready for some time now and the progress he has made with the bat is truly remarkable. So remarkable, in fact, that he is now the youngest position player in franchise history.</p>\n<p>“Every baseball player’s dream is to be a big leaguer. So that’s definitely a dream achieved and accomplished. But it’s a lot to take in, at the moment.” said Tovar when asked about his first taste of the majors. </p>\n<p>His arrival also signifies a change in expectations. There will be bumps in the road for Tovar the player, and he will be given a chance to learn on the job as any late-season prospect call-up should. But those learning experiences are being done in low-leverage situations, free of major consequences when the hiccups occur.</p>\n<p>This safety net, for both he and Toglia, is to help prepare them for success when the opportunity for the winning moments arrives. And that’s what the Rockies brand has been selling in recent seasons; the promise of better days ahead.</p>\n<p>The organization has floundered in their attempts to dig out of a deeply-rooted apathy in the fan base ever since the Nolan Arenado trade became official. And, no matter how tired you may be of hearing about it, that saga is what still defines the organization.</p>\n<p>But now there is Toglia and Tovar, present and accounted for. Behind them are Veen and Romo with Benny Montgomery and the Fresno Grizzlies core riding up from the horizon. It’s a legitimate crop of prospects that has earned the franchise a noticeable bump in prospect circles and started to generate genuine enthusiasm again from the fan base.</p>\n<p>They are still years away from truly competing, though. Likely not until 2024, at the earliest. And the front office still has work to do padding this emerging core with better surrounding talent, the playoff years of 2018 and 2019 were lesson in that. But seeing Ezequiel Tovar and Michael Toglia take the field is a start…a pretty good start for a franchise that has shown little progress in recent years.</p>\n<p>★ ★ ★</p>\nPujols joins 700 home run club with pair of HRs | MLB\n<p>It was a historic night in Los Angeles as Albert Pujols hit two home runs to become the fourth player in baseball history to hit 700 home runs, joining Barry Bonds (762), Hank Aaron (755) and Babe Ruth (714).

        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/09/mrna-covid-vaccine-booster-lymphoma-cancer/671308/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "<p>O</p><p>n September 22 of last year, Michel Goldman, a Belgian immunologist and one of Europe’s best-known champions of medical research, walked into a clinic near his house, rolled up his sleeve, and had a booster shot delivered to his arm. He knew he’d need it more than most.</p><p>Just a few weeks earlier, Michel, 67, had been to see his younger brother, Serge, the head of nuclear medicine at the hospital of the Université Libre de Bruxelles, where both men are professors. Michel was having night sweats, and he could feel swollen lymph nodes in his neck, so his brother brought him in for a full-body CT scan. When the images came through to Serge’s computer they revealed a smattering of inky spots, bunched near Michel’s left armpit and running up along his neck. It was cancer of the immune system—lymphoma.</p><p>Given his own area of expertise, Michel understood this meant he’d soon be immunocompromised by chemotherapy. With another winter on the way—and perhaps another wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections—that meant he had just a narrow window of opportunity in which his body would respond in full to COVID vaccination. Having received two doses of Pfizer the prior spring, Michel quickly went to get his third. If he was about to spend months absorbing poison as he tried to beat a deadly cancer, at least he’d have the most protection possible from the pandemic.</p><p>Within a few days, though, Michel was somehow feeling even worse. His night sweats got much more intense, and he found himself—quite out of character—taking afternoon naps. Most worryingly, his lymph nodes were even more swollen than before. He conferred with Serge again, and they set up another body scan for September 30, six days before Michel was scheduled to start his cancer treatment. Once again he sat in the radiology waiting room while his brother waited for the pictures to appear on his computer.</p><p>Serge’s bushy eyebrows furrowed when he spoke with Michel after having seen the scans. (“I will always remember his face, it was just incredible,” Michel told me.) The pictures showed a brand-new barrage of cancer lesions—so many spots that it looked like someone had set off fireworks inside Michel’s body. More than that, the lesions were now prominent on both sides of the body, with new clusters blooming in Michel’s right armpit in particular, and along the right side of his neck.</p><p>When Michel’s hematologist saw the scan, she told him to report directly to the nearest hospital pharmacy. He’d have to start on steroid pills right away, she told him. Such a swift progression for lymphoma in just three weeks was highly unusual, and he could not risk waiting a single day longer.</p><p>As he followed these instructions, Michel felt a gnawing worry that his COVID booster shot had somehow made him sicker. His brother was harboring a similar concern. The asymmetrical cluster of cancerous nodes around Michel’s left armpit on the initial scan had already seemed “a bit disturbing,” as his brother said; especially given that Michel’s first two doses of vaccine had been delivered on that side. Now he’d had a booster shot in the other arm, and the cancer’s asymmetry was flipped.</p><p>The brothers knew this might be just an eerie coincidence. But they couldn’t shake the feeling that Michel had experienced what would be a very rare yet life-threatening side effect of COVID vaccination. For a doctor who had spent four decades studying and advocating for new medicines, that feeling would unfold into many months of deliberation and self-doubt. Michel used to run an institute for vaccine-technology research, and he’s spoken out to reassure the public about the safety of the COVID vaccines, and of the mRNA vaccines in particular. In December 2020, he told an interviewer that “if there was a real problem with the technology, we’d have seen it before now for sure.” His “main concern,” he continued, was that people would use the mere possibility of side effects “as an argument not to be vaccinated.”</p><p>But now that possibility appeared to be splattered all across his medical charts. Michel Goldman, champion of the mRNA vaccines, suspected that he was their unlucky victim.</p><p>I happened to speak with Michel by phone in April 2021, months before his cancer diagnosis. I’d called him to discuss another potential side effect of COVID vaccination, one associated in particular with the shot made by AstraZeneca. By that point, 220 people who’d received that vaccine had developed an unusual—and very dangerous—blood-clotting syndrome, which was characterized by an atypical low platelet count. At least seven people in the U.K. alone had died of the complication. Michel patiently laid out the different mechanisms that might explain this strange condition. But he was quick to add that the mRNA COVID vaccines were built in a way that could mitigate the risk of this particular problem.</p><p>Michel currently leads the I3h institute, a university hub aimed at assisting in drug-design projects; in an earlier posting, he headed a $2 billion European endeavor to accelerate the research of new medicines. As such, he’s spent many years attending to the possible risks—even tiny ones—of novel medical treatments. He has raised awareness about the iron overload that used to afflict dialysis patients before the advent of a drug known as erythropoietin, for example; and looked for signs of “cytokine storms” in kidney-transplant recipients who received monoclonal-antibody treatments. So when a plethora of new vaccines for COVID emerged in the first year of the pandemic, he was watching very closely.</p><p>When we talked about the potential side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine last year, Michel made it clear that, in the big picture, any chance of serious complications from the shots would be orders of magnitude smaller than the chance of complications from the pandemic illness itself. If COVID vaccines caused clotting disorders or myocarditis in a tiny percentage of those who received them, he assured me, COVID would lead to stroke or heart inflammation in a much larger group.</p><p>The risks and benefits for each vaccine should be weighed against each other, he continued. If AstraZeneca were the only option, then its protection might be worth the very small risk of developing a rare blood disorder. But given the availability of Pfizer, Moderna, and other COVID vaccines, many people could opt for a safer alternative.</p><p>Now that risk-benefit calculation has been thrust upon him in a personal and terrifying way. By the time we spoke again, he’d become a cancer patient who suspected that his mRNA vaccine might have made things worse. Michel is reserved by nature, prone to making matter-of-fact remarks rather than emotive musings. In this case, I found him more guarded than ever, and I could tell he’d struggled over how he should describe his own experience—or, indeed, whether he should even be describing it at all. Perhaps his hypothesis was wrong, and the course of his cancer had had nothing to do with the shots. Or maybe the cancer and the mRNA vaccine were connected, but the risk of getting immunized was still just a tiny speck beside the benefits. Applying the same logic that he’d used before, he decided it made sense to go public with this theory. If other people with the same lymphoma felt the need to hedge their bets, they might consider holding off on the Pfizer and Moderna shots.</p><p>Michel knew that by speaking out about another potential rare effect—especially without hard proof—he’d be introducing a different kind of risk. Recent years had already seen a rise in anti-vaccine disinformation, and protesters have thrown menstrual blood at state legislators and issued death threats to public-health officials. Fearmongers have made the problem worse by citing scary-sounding data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a U.S. government database of possible side effects from immunizations, with insufficient context. In Europe, French police used tear gas to disperse anti-vaccine protesters who were aiming fireworks at officers in July of 2021; a vaccination center was set ablaze in Poland a few weeks later. Michel was well aware of all this trend; in fact, he’d been sounding the alarm about the spread of vaccine misinformation online before the pandemic even started. If he shared his own experience of cancer, might that make the problem worse?</p><p>This was not a reason to remain silent, Michel eventually decided. It was a reason to speak carefully.</p><p>First things first: Before Michel could tackle the conundrum of going public with this theory, he’d need to get his cancer under control. On October 6, he sat in a hospital room in Brussels, feeling quite afraid while nurses hooked up an infusion line to the catheter that had been surgically embedded near his collarbone. After so many years spent working as a doctor, he was suddenly a patient. People with his kind of lymphoma have only about a 30 percent chance of surviving longer than five years, and the aggressiveness of his disease meant that the medications would have to be intense. The drug that Michel was getting for his first infusion, called brentuximab vedotin, would be the newest and potentially riskiest in his regimen. Side effects can include breathing difficulties, blistering skin, and even permanent nerve damage.</p><p>Michel didn’t end up having any of those symptoms, but he did feel very weak. He convalesced at home, and for several days felt unable to do much of anything. But as soon as a bit of his strength came back, he started going through the cancer-research literature. He had several weeks until the next infusion, which meant he had several weeks to figure out whether the vaccine really had quickened his lymphoma, and whether other cancer patients might be in danger from the shots. He was used to reading stacks of science papers for his work; now he did so at an even faster pace.</p><p>Michel’s cancer was the kind that attacks the body’s T cells, which coordinate the immune response to invading pathogens. T-cell lymphomas come in roughly 30 different subtypes; Michel’s, known as angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, affects what are called follicular helper T cells, which hang out in the tonsils and the lymph nodes, among other tissues. Follicular helper T cells serve a crucial role in the cascade of events to protect the body after dangerous invaders have arrived. That process begins with dendritic cells, which identify a virus or other pathogen and present examples of it to the rest of the immune system. The helper T cells do just as their name suggests: They help pass that message along to B cells, which end up making protective antibodies against the virus.</p><p>Michel had recently learned that mRNA vaccines, such as the Pfizer shots he had received, are especially effective at generating that message, and spurring its passage through the helper T cells. Some researchers argue that the COVID vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been more protective than others for exactly this reason: They rev up those cells with extra oomph. Now Michel began to wonder whether that oomph could, in ultrarare cases, turn out to be a liability. Perhaps the shots gave such a jolt to his helper T cells that they went berserk. If they were prone to forming tumors, or if they were already cancerous, then overstimulation could have made the problem even worse.</p><p>As the days went by, Michel found other clues suggesting that the link was real, and that the mRNA vaccines might be risky for a specific subset of the population. He learned that body scans of some of those who get vaccines, including cancer patients, have shown heightened activity in the lymph nodes near the armpit on the side where the shot was received. He also came across another, very important clue. In 2018, a team of researchers based at Columbia University’s Institute for Cancer Genetics had published an intriguing study using mice with a pair of gene mutations that, when they co-occur, predispose T cells to go rogue. (Michel’s tumor, which had been sequenced by this point, showed the same two mutations.) When these mice were injected with sheep red-blood cells—as an experimental stand-in for invading microbes—the animals developed the subtype of lymphoma that was diagnosed in Michel.</p><p>Now Michel had a theory to explain the bleak coincidence that had befallen him. Serge agreed that it made sense. The brothers had co-written research papers in the past, including ones on the use of stem cells for heart repair and dendritic-cell vaccines for cancer. It was time for them to write another.</p><p>On October 20 of last year, Hans-Georg Eichler, a clinical pharmacologist and former senior medical officer for the European Medicines Agency, opened up his email to find a message from Michel. The two have known each other for more than a decade. “I hope that you are well,” the message started, “which is not really my case ...” Michel had pasted in a link to a medical report, not yet published. “I am curious to hear your thoughts,” he wrote.</p><p>The paper, titled “Rapid Progression of Angioimmunoblastic T Cell Lymphoma Following BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine Booster Shot” and credited to Serge Goldman, Michel Goldman, and six of their Belgian colleagues, would run in the journal Frontiers in Medicine a few weeks later. (Michel is that journal’s editor in chief; he recused himself from the process of editing and peer review.) It begins by describing “a 66-year-old man with no significant medical history” who had been diagnosed with lymphoma that worsened following a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine. The Goldmans’ unusual connection to the data—the fact that the 66-year-old man in question was Michel—comes across obliquely in the text. An ethics statement, printed at the end of the case report, includes the line: “Being one of the authors, the patient consented to the publication.”</p><p>[Read: A prominent vaccine skeptic returns to Twitter]</p><p>Eichler, who had closely followed the furor over vaccine-associated blood-clot disorders the previous spring, replied that evening: “I have read the paper and am very impressed … It is the most responsible and courageous thing you could do under the worst possible circumstances.”</p><p>“I would say that 95 percent of the reactions were extremely friendly,” Michel told me later. But as he’d feared, anti-vaccine activists picked up on the story. “The lymph nodes of those who have taken these shots are exploding, burgeoning, and bulging with this toxic bioweapon,” a right-wing influencer named Jane Ruby wrote on Telegram beneath a screenshot of Michel’s CT scans, which had appeared in his published paper (and are reproduced in this article). “LYMPHOMA - That’s right… Cancer of the lymphatic system … STOP THIS FROM GETTING INTO BABIES AND CHILDREN!!!!!” Ruby’s claims were amplified on Natural News, among other anti-vaccination sites where, again, the very images that Michel’s brother had used to diagnose his illness were presented as shocking evidence of vaccination’s dangers. “PHOTOS: LYMPHOMA CANCER EXPLODING IN THE BOOSTED,” one website said.</p>\r\nMichel Goldman’s CT scan (Courtesy Michel Goldman)\r\n<p>When I told Michel about these online posts, he shook his head in disappointment. “They’re looking for anything to support their crazy vision,” he said. “It makes me sad about the world in which we are living.” That’s not to say he was surprised. Michel knew, for instance, that medical experts have dispelled false rumors about vaccines infecting people with COVID-19. He told me that he’d obsessed over getting the tone of the manuscript exactly right, so as not to fuel vaccine skepticism. He was careful, for example, to describe the vaccine as possibly “inducing” the “progression” of his cancer—rather than “causing” it to surface. “I spent hours and hours,” he said. “I’ve never spent so much time on details in a paper.”</p><p>Extremely rare cases like Michel’s create a tricky terrain for science communication. Even a clinical trial with thousands of participants might never turn up a single case of someone's cancer worsening after vaccination. In that context, experts can't assign a statistical estimate of the risk across the wider population. Science journalists may be wary of reporting on the story for that reason. In fact, when Michel first told me about his cancer and about the paper he’d written with his brother, I said that I couldn’t write about it. I was worried that some readers would misinterpret my article, and mistakenly see it as a reason not to get vaccinated. As I write this, I’m still concerned that you might do exactly that.</p><p>But the scientific literature is sprinkled with odd cases like Michel’s that have puzzled doctors. The Goldmans’ paper follows earlier isolated reports suggesting a possible link between COVID-19 vaccination and lymphoma. Aaron Mangold, who heads the division of clinical dermatology at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, co-authored a paper published in May 2021 about a patient whose rare skin lymphoma recurred after his initial Pfizer shot. The tumorous ulcer appeared in the armpit of the same arm in which the man had received the injection, and then regressed spontaneously. A second shot of the vaccine, delivered three weeks later, produced no further lesions, Mangold told me, and the whole ordeal could have simply been a coincidence. He felt that he’d been “threading the needle” to go public with the case report given that uncertainty.</p><p>[Read: The differences between the vaccines matter]</p><p>Ladan Zand, a nephrologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, faced the same conundrum when she co-authored a paper last year detailing five patients who had a relapse of kidney disease following mRNA COVID vaccination. Her team also documented eight patients who were newly diagnosed with the disease, known as glomerulonephritis, after receiving the shot. But Zand cautions that those patients might have had underlying kidney disease and not been aware of it. People infected with the novel coronavirus also show higher rates of kidney-function decline over time. “I spend half of my visits now asking patients to get vaccinated,” she said. “If you were to compare the risks and benefits, the benefits of the vaccine way outweigh the risk of rare entities that, for the most part, seem to be self-limiting.”</p><p>William Murphy, an immunologist at UC Davis, told me that Michel’s before-and-after CT scans were fascinating in the context of the mouse study from Columbia. The cancer’s behavior certainly appeared to be related to the vaccine, he said, “given the huge difference in the scans of the tumor progression in a very short period of time.” But one can’t be certain, however striking the data. It’s just a case report, he added—one patient.</p><p>The Goldmans’ paper, for its part, notes that it would be “premature” to extrapolate the findings from Michel to other patients with the same kind of cancer, and that the link, even if it were proved, should not discourage general uptake of “much-needed vaccines.” An unusual paragraph tacked onto the bottom of the article underscores the point. Marked “Patient Perspective,” and written in the third person, it notes that Michel himself “remains convinced that mRNA vaccines represent very efficient products with a favorable benefit-risk ratio,” and that he hopes the report will encourage further research.</p><p>In mid-February, Michel spiked a sudden fever. COVID had finally caught up with him.</p><p>Given that he was immunocompromised by six rounds of cancer chemotherapy, Michel knew that his doctors would need to act quickly. He soon received an infusion of the monoclonal-antibody drug sotrovimab, and managed to recover without incident; his lymph nodes stayed blessedly quiet, and there was no resurgence of his cancer. Now he’s eligible for a second booster shot, but he’s not sure whether he should take it. “I don't know what I will do,” he said.</p><p>Would another dose of the vaccine cause another round of cancer lesions? Michel and the scientists who have been in touch with him are still mulling the evidence about whether his original cancer flare was simply a fluke. Steven Horwitz, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering who focuses on the care of patients with lymphoma, has looked more closely at vaccine side effects since hearing about Michel’s case, and feels reassured by what he’s found. “Of our patients who received mRNA COVID vaccines, we have not seen any clearly related and documented relapses or progressions,” he told me via email. Meanwhile, lymphomas and the treatments given for them can weaken the immune system, putting affected patients at higher risk of severe COVID-19 if infected. “Vaccination remains the most effective way to mitigate that risk,” he said.</p><p>I reached out to the makers of the mRNA COVID vaccines to ask about Michel’s case. A representative for Pfizer noted that the company takes such reports “very seriously” but that, “to date, there has been no identified correlation between the vaccine and cancer.” Moderna’s chief medical officer, Paul Burton, told me that the company keeps careful track of safety data and has not found any relationship between vaccination and lymphoma. He also pointed to the case of a 61-year-old woman with cancer of the salivary gland whose tumor shrank to about one-quarter of its original size in the month after she received a second dose of the Moderna vaccine. “Now, did it really regress because the person got a messenger RNA vaccine?” he asked. “I don't know. I think biology is truly a remarkable thing.\"</p><p>While Michel remains unsure about his fourth shot, he has continued to be outspoken on the benefits of vaccination overall, and often speaks to Belgian media on the topic. At the same time, he has become a stronger advocate for broader tracking of adverse events from vaccines—an endeavor he and others in drug development call “pharmacovigilance.” “We need to make sure that some pharmacovigilance programs are powered to detect very, very rare side effects,” Michel told me. Eichler, who was involved in drug regulation for the European Medicines Agency, said that while some doctors may be “aficionados” of randomized controlled trials as the only valid source of medical evidence, other types of information are needed. Michel’s case shows why: You’ve got a patient “who is a professor of medicine, who experiences the side effects and says, ‘Okay, this must be a side effect,’” Eichler said. That “rings the bells. Could Michel have ever come up in an RCT? My answer is probably not.”</p><p>Just a few days before Michel got COVID, he had gone back to Serge’s office for yet another set of full-body CT images, to check the status of his cancer. He sat in his brother’s waiting room, as he had last September, while Serge examined the results. This time, though, Serge’s expression was relaxed. The scans were clear.</p><p>Michel still has to watch out for a recurrence. And as a longtime immunologist and medical innovator, he’s still considering the question of whether a vaccine that is saving tens of millions of lives each year might have put his own in jeopardy. He remains adamant that COVID-19 vaccines are necessary and useful for the vast majority of people. But he wants the discussion about vaccines to be transparent.</p><p>Around the time of his February follow-up, Michel received a message from a doctor who had read his self-referential case report. The doctor’s mother had been diagnosed with the same subtype of lymphoma that Michel has following a COVID booster shot. More recently, he got an email from a woman whose sister had been vaccinated and received that diagnosis the following month. Again, these could be coincidences. Or maybe they are the second and third data points in a growing set. The possible connection between Michel’s lymphoma flare and his COVID-19 vaccination occupies much of his thinking these days. “If it exists, it must be very rare,” he said. But he doesn’t regret going public with his case. “I’m still convinced it was the right thing to do.”</p>",

        "link": "https://reason.com/2022/09/24/in-purported-global-first-dutch-city-bans-meat-ads/",
        "description": "<p>Earlier this month, reports indicated that Haarlem, The Netherlands, had become the first city in the world to ban advertisements for meat and meat products from appearing in public spaces such as buses. The city says it adopted the ban, which will take effect in 2024, to reduce meat consumption and combat climate change.</p>\n<p>The ban made news around the world, with some outlets suggesting this global first could or should herald similar bans in other countries.</p>\n<p>Councilor Ziggy Klazes, the local councilmember who drafted the ban, acknowledged stern opposition. \"Of course, there are a lot of people who find the decision outrageous and patronising, but there are also a lot of people who think it's fine,\" Klazes said in remarks reported by The Guardian.  \"It is a signal–if it is picked up nationally, that would only be very nice. There are many groups… who think it is a good idea and want to try it.\" </p>\n<p>While Haarlem's ban could herald similar bans, that's not because it should. It's a lousy idea.</p>\n<p>The ban is problematic for reasons beyond its attack on free speech—starting with the premise that meat makes some sort of outsized contribution to climate change, a claim that's been challenged. As an NBC News op-ed explained last year, \"only about 15 to 18 percent of carbon emissions come from livestock. And that number includes all livestock on the planet as well as the entire process of raising, slaughtering, transporting and eating meat—including the carbon you yourself make while eating and digesting it…. Notably, only a portion of that process involves actual animals. The rest of it is transportation and processes that also produce carbon when growing and consuming vegetables, wheat and practically everything else we eat.\"</p>\n<p>Even if eating meat contributes to climate change and that was somehow a good reason to ban eating or marketing meat—it's not—bans still ignore the fact not all meat has the same carbon footprint. For example, this producer in Manitoba says it's been carbon neutral since 2019. Others—including big American producers—could join that producer if they choose. A white paper published last year by UC-Davis researchers outlined steps the U.S. beef and dairy producers could take to become carbon neutral by 2050. </p>\n<p>If the ban itself is dubious, the claim it's the first ban of its type may be as well. In 2017, Australian ad censors reversed course and banned an ad depicting a host of godly figures (including Zeus, Jesus, and L. Ron Hubbard) eating lamb after Hindu protestors complained about the ad's portrayal of Ganesha, a Hindu god (and vegetarian) received \"less favourable treatment\" in the ad than did the other religious figures. </p>\n<p>Some governments have gone beyond banning the marketing of meat and just banned meat itself. For example, some cities in the Indian state of Gujarat last year banned the \"preparation and display of non-vegetarian food in public,\" based on claims that displays of meat led to \"traffic jams…. and had a negative impact on people, particularly children.\"</p>\n<p>Calls to ban fast-food marketing—always heavy on meat-centric foods—as here and here, have been around for years and have even become law in places such as Australia. In the United States, ads for meat or any other food are protected by the First Amendment. But even that didn't stop Missouri lawmakers, in 2018, from banning the use of the word \"meat\" from appearing on any food not made from the flesh of animals. </p>\n<p>While I oppose any government prohibitions on meat advertising, I am a staunch supporter of ending government-supported advertising of meat. In the United States, the USDA's beef checkoff program, as I explained in a column last year, is a mandatory, wasteful marketing program that forces farmers and ranchers to participate. I noted the \"antiquated, mandatory, collectivist… expensive, pointless, and unconstitutional\" marketing scheme forces American farmers and ranchers to spend around $750 million each year on government-approved marketing that may not benefit them (and which many farmers oppose) while raising costs for consumers.</p>\n<p>Governments should not be in the business of promoting or restricting meat or any particular diets—including the marketing of such diets—any more than they should be involved in promoting or restricting any religion, hairstyle, or consensual adult relationships. Haarlem's meat-ad ban, despite its supporters claiming it's well-intentioned, is—as its author suggested—both \"outrageous and patronising.\"</p>\n<p>The post In Purported Global First, Dutch City Bans Meat Ads appeared first on Reason.com.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Keith Birmingham/MediaNews Group/Pasadena Star-News via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The big news before Friday’s game was the Dodgers removing Craig Kimbrel from the closer role. Read more about it from Bill Plunkett of the Orange County Register, Fabian Ardaya at The Athletic, and Juan Toribio at MLB.com. </p>\n<p>And since this is a morning links post, I’d be remiss without sharing this photo from Friday’s pregame ceremony honoring retiring Cardinals Albert Pujols and Yadier Molina.</p>\n\n\n<p>A little something for retirement. Best of luck, @PujolsFive and @Yadimolina04! pic.twitter.com/YuaEDKIVDi</p>— Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\nLinks\n<p>Clayton Kershaw shared in great detail his between-starts routine with Lindsay Berra at Mustard, including this incredibly specific detail: “I’ll go out to the field at 6:23 for a 7:10 game. I do my normal stretch, which takes 13 minutes, from 6:23 to 6:36.”</p>\n<p>I missed this from Thursday night, but how Cody Bellinger’s leadoff double in the ninth inning — which he hit from roughly his shoe tops — off Reyes Moronta was described by D-backs manager Torey Lovullo was interesting, from Beth Harris at the Associated Press: “He was ahead of Bellinger 0-2 and then it ended up being a 3-2 pitch kind of down in the bottom of the zone, right in his honey hole.”</p>\n<p>Miguel Vargas was named the Dodgers minor league player of the year by Baseball America earlier in September. The accompanying article, written by Bill Plunkett, was put in front of the paywall for the rest of the month. In the article, Dave Roberts says of Vargas, “He does everything. He hunts pitches. He values the walk. He does everything a young hitter is supposed to do. He’ll be special for a long time.”</p>\n<p>With no more Games 163 to break ties, Team Entropy gets a fond farewell from its greatest champion, Jay Jaffe at FanGraphs.</p>\n<p>With Shohei reaching 200 strikeouts on the season Friday night, this MLB graphic is incredible, and includes Hall of Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, too:</p>\n\n\n<p>There's only ONE Shohei Ohtani!   pic.twitter.com/sSFkVaF7m7</p>— MLB (@MLB) September 24, 2022",

        "description": "Photo by Julio Aguilar/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Recapping how the Yankees’ top AL opponents fared on September 23rd.</p> <p>The Yankees continued their resurgent September and march toward the AL East crown last night with a 5-4 victory keyed by Aaron Hicks, Jose Trevino, and Jonathan Loáisiga. No, it did not have any Aaron Judge heroics, but that’s okay! A win is a win, and it’s also probably a win for our collective psyches that No. 61 didn’t come on Apple TV+.</p>\n<p>That was just the Bronx though; other notable games occurred around baseball (not just the Albert Pujols 700 Show), and some had ramifications on the pennant run. Here’s what happened.</p>\n\nBaltimore Orioles 6 (79-71), Houston Astros 0 (99-53)\n\n<p>The only thing I love more than the fact that the Orioles refuse to completely die in AL Wild Card race is the fact that they’re successfully fighting for their lives against the dumb Astros. For the second consecutive night, they blanked Houston, and while Kyle Bradish was pulled after 8.2 innings yesterday, Dean Kremer went straight through that finish line. After holding the Astros to one run in 7.2 innings on August 27th, Kremer topped that with a four-hit shutout, walking just two and striking out six during his first career complete game.</p>\n\n<p>On the offensive side of the ball, Rookie of the Year contender Adley Rutschman put Baltimore up in the fourth with a solo shot against José Urquidy, and after RBI hits from Terrin Vavra and Cedric Mullins off Hector Neris in the seventh, Rutschman delivered again with another run-scoring hit. It was his 32nd two-bagger of 2022, tying a franchise rookie doubles record held by no less a luminary than Cal Ripken Jr.</p>\n<p>Even better for the O’s? The Mariners lost to Kansas City, so Baltimore cut its Wild Card deficit to three games.</p>\n\nTampa Bay Rays 10 (84-67), Toronto Blue Jays 6 (84-67)\n\n<p>The Rays did the Yankees another solid on Friday night by lighting up the tiring Blue Jays. After jumping out to a 3-0 lead on Mitch White, Toronto actually came back to score four times in the fifth, putting the Rays into a bit of trouble. But when seemingly no one in the bullpen can actually get a game under control, it’s going to be a tough time, especially on the road.</p>\n<p>Randy Arozarena was the catalyst, cracking an opposite-field blast for three off Anthony Bass, putting the Rays ahead by a 6-4 score.</p>\n\n<p>Since Tampa reliever Colin Poche didn’t exactly have a good day either, Toronto tied it again at 6-6 on an Arozarena error and sacrifice fly by George Springer. Those were the last runs surrendered by the Rays bullpen though, and on the other side, Yimi Garcia coughed up four in the eighth — with no help at all from Bo Bichette.</p>\n\n<p>That is a brutal error in an already-tough situation. The Rays’ double-digit runs put this game away and helped them tie the Blue Jays at the top of the Wild Card race (1.5 up on Seattle). The Blue Jays’ loss benefitted the victorious Yankees, who cut their magic number for the AL East down to four. Since Toronto and Tampa Bay are still playing each other, the earliest the Yankees could clinch the division title is north of the border on Monday.</p>\n\nCleveland Guardians 6 (84-67), Texas Rangers 3 (65-85)\n\n<p>One wild thing that’s happened in September is that suddenly, the AL Central champion might not be so puny after all. For much of the season, it felt like whichever middling team between the White Sox, Twins, and Guardians won the division, they would be the worst AL team in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>However, Cleveland has won 16 of its past 19 games to absolutely ice the division title and also to even its record with Wild Card-leading Toronto and Tampa Bay. It’s just semantics, but the Mariners would also be a game and a half behind the Guardians. Perhaps the top three AL teams will be the division winners after all. How about that?</p>\n<p>As for the game on Friday night, the Guardians overcame a two-run error by Myles Straw in the second to plate five runs in the sixth against poor Rangers reliever Taylor Hearn.</p>\n\n<p>Josh Naylor started the scoring with a double to tie the game, and RBI hits from Oscar Gonzalez, Andrés Giménez, and Will Brennan made it 6-2, Cleveland. Sam Hentges, James Karnichak, and Emmanuel Clase combined for three shutout innings to finish the ballgame. The Guardians’ magic number for the AL Central now sits at three.</p>\n\nKansas City Royals 5 (62-89), Seattle Mariners 1 (82-68)\n\n<p>Even with a Mariners win, it probably wouldn’t have been a satisfying Friday night for their fans, as they had to deal with the loss of star rookie Julio Rodríguez, who hit the 10-day IL with a lower back strain. They’re hoping to have him back for the final series of the regular season against the Tigers, but they’re surely going to miss him in the meantime as they try to lock down a Wild Card spot over Baltimore.</p>\n<p>What doesn’t bode well is that despite getting to play the dismal Angels, A’s, Royals, Rangers, and Tigers over their final 20 games of 2022, they’re off to an awful start in that cushy stretch. They lost three of four in Anaheim and two of three in Oakland, and they dropped their series opener in Kansas City, too.</p>\n<p>The Royals moved to 3-0 in the J.J. Picollo Era, shaking off a second-inning homer from Cal Raleigh to score five unanswered runs against Marco Gonzales and the M’s bullpen. Brady Singer twirled seven frames of one-run ball, allowing just five hits.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The email came from a stranger. “Dear Mr. Temple,” it said. “My name is Andrea Paiss, and I live in Budapest, Hungary. I do not know whether I write to the right person. I just hope so.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt reached me in San Francisco on January 1, 2020, and told of a “Granny,” then 92, who wanted to know what had happened to her cousin Lorant Stein. Andrea had found a document online about Lorant in the Central Database of Shoah Victims at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem. It had been submitted by someone named John Temple. Could I be that same John Temple, she asked, the one who had filled out the form by hand 20 years earlier? “I would be happy if you could tell me how you [are] related to Lorant, as we have no information about relatives in America.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt first my wife, Judith, and I were mistrustful. Could this be an attempt to get money, a scam of some kind? I had filled out the form, but I had no information about relatives still living in Hungary. The last, I thought, had been two sisters of my grandfather who died years ago.  </p><p>When I was a boy, my family was small: my parents, my mother’s parents, and my older brother. That was it. My father’s mother lived alone in Vienna, and died when I was 10. His father had died in 1945. Growing up in Vancouver, British Columbia, in the 1950s and ’60s, we were different from my friends’ families. Unlike their parents, mine were immigrants, from Austria and Hungary, who spoke English with heavy accents. They also spoke Hungarian and German. They ate chicken paprikash and goulash, not hamburgers and hot dogs. All the same, they wanted us to fit in, starting with the vanilla names they gave us: Chris and John.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe were to be of the New World, not the Old.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore receiving the email, I couldn’t recall ever meeting anyone other than my parents and grandparents who had known my uncle, Lorant, my mother’s brother.</p><p>Andi, as Andrea calls herself, told me that her Granny, Magda Gardonyi, remembered Lorant fondly. She still recalled vividly the last day they had arranged to meet. It was December 6, 1944, during the worst period of World War II in Budapest for Jews. Lorant never showed up. After that, she said, she never heard from him again. Now, more than 75 years later, she had asked Andi to try to find out what had happened to him. Magda didn’t know that Lorant had been arrested by the Germans two days later. That, along with almost 2,000 other Jewish men, he had been transported from Budapest to Buchenwald, the concentration camp in Germany where, on December 25, 1944, he became Prisoner No. 32317.</p>\r\nLorant Stein, photographed on an unknown date in the early 1940s. (Courtesy John Temple)\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhen I filed the form at Yad Vashem, I didn’t know those facts either. My parents always told me they had tried everything to learn his fate, to no avail. But the internet has made many records more easily discoverable, and as a journalist, when I had some time on my hands I would occasionally search for him. In 2013, a year before my mother died, I discovered his fate.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn our first video call, Magda’s long face and deep smile seemed familiar to me. I told myself she looked like family. She had shelves stacked with books behind her, just as I did. She told me things I had never heard about Lorant. She recalled how he would visit her family with my grandfather every year after his bar mitzvah, during the High Holidays. High Holidays? I didn’t know they had been part of the rhythm of my family’s prewar life. Bar mitzvah? I didn’t know that Lorant had even had one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI felt I had to explain why I couldn’t speak Hungarian. It would have been so much easier to talk with each other if Andi didn’t have to translate for each of us. I told them that when my parents had come to Canada, they’d wanted their children to be free of the past, that they had wanted to start new lives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat must have sounded strange to Magda. She still lived in the same apartment where her cousin and his father—my uncle and my grandfather—used to visit her 80 years before.</p><p>My parents never told me we were Jewish. I discovered it as a teenager. A psychiatrist born in Vienna hit me with it one day when I sat down in his office in my hometown in Canada. He said, “You are Jewish.” I was stunned. Although why, I’m not sure, given all the signs around me.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI went home and confronted my mother and father. We talked in the kitchen. Argued. They didn’t see themselves as Jewish. They saw “Jewish” as a label that others—the Nazis—had branded them with, not who they actually were. I didn’t understand. I was confused. It would take me more than 40 years to confirm that the psychiatrist was right.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy mother, Eva, had gone to a renowned Protestant school in Budapest, the same one the heroic Zionist Hannah Szenes attended, a year or two behind my mom. My mother’s parents sent her there because they wanted her to get the best education. They didn’t practice any religion, to my knowledge. My mother deeply mistrusted any group identity. My father, René, was anti-religious. He grew up in Vienna, and witnessed the city embrace the Nazis in 1938, something that wouldn’t happen in Budapest until six years later. His father moved the family to Hungary because he thought it would be safer for his wife and son. In Budapest, my mother told me, she never wore the yellow star when Jews were required to do so. She never joined her parents in what was known as the city’s International Ghetto, where they and many other Jews were forced to live in overcrowded apartments. Instead, she resisted, joining an underground cell using false identity papers, under the name Fazekas Erzsebet. With her blue eyes and blond hair, she pretended she was from Transylvania and rented apartments that were used to hide people from the Nazis.  </p><p>My parents had longed for a better world than the one they had known under Nazi occupation. But the reality under a corrupt Communist government after the war was so miserable, they couldn’t stand it. In 1946, seeking personal and political freedom, they fled to Vienna, hidden in an oil barrel on a Russian army truck. (Under Soviet rule, they weren’t permitted to leave legally.) In 1948, they went on to Canada, and kept going as far as they could. To the end of the line: Vancouver, the last stop on the country’s transcontinental railway.</p><p>They knew they never wanted their children to experience the same nightmare, and the one sure way to do that, they thought, was to put an end to anyone being able to label them Jewish. My father knew his wife was Jewish but she didn’t see herself that way. My mother told me she didn’t even know my father was Jewish until years after arriving in Canada, when they visited an aunt in the United States. He had hidden his mother’s Jewish family from his own wife. He hid them from me, too.  </p><p>Before I visited Vienna for the first time, in 1978, he told me about the tomb of his Catholic father’s family, in the city’s central cemetery. But he spoke of no other graves I should visit. He proudly encouraged me to see the bust of the most famous member of his family at the university in Vienna. But he didn’t mention where that person and many other ancestors were buried—the Jewish section of the central cemetery.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe past. Forgotten. Or at least a key part of it. That’s the way they wanted it.</p><p>My engagement to Judith, in 1983, was when things came to a head. We asked a Conservative rabbi to officiate our wedding. He congratulated us and asked for our mothers’ Hebrew names. Judith could answer. I couldn’t.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\nAll I knew, I told him, was that my grandmother, when I had shown her a picture of the Dohany Street Synagogue after my first visit to Budapest, in 1978, had exclaimed, “That’s where we got married!”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI had been shocked. She had never given any indication of having participated in Jewish life, except as a very young girl, when she lived with her father’s mother. She recalled the prayers she’d heard in the house. The Iron Curtain was still up when my grandmother cracked the wall of secrecy—I could find no way to verify what she had told me. As a result, the rabbi said he couldn’t marry us in a Jewish ceremony. I was taken aback.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA couple of years after being told of my origins by the psychiatrist, right after I graduated from high school, I had worked to save money, then went to Israel on my own. I spent six months studying Hebrew and working on a kibbutz in the Galilee. I saw myself as Jewish. But I understood the rabbi’s perspective. Under the Jewish law of matrilineal descent, I couldn’t be considered Jewish, because I had no proof that my mother was Jewish. The rabbi told me I could convert. And that’s what I chose to do. Why not affirm it, make it official? In the spring of 1984, I formally converted to Judaism.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen we were married that summer, my grandmother still hid that she was Jewish. My grandfather was already gone. My father, who had hoped to end the cycle of persecution against our family, cried under the chuppah. I’m not sure whether from sorrow over my decision to embrace our Jewish identity or from joy. I like to think the latter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen, nearly 40 years later, Zsofia Heeger, a Budapest genealogist who helped Andi find me for her grandmother, quickly pierced the wall. Less than two weeks after I received Andi’s email, Zsofia found my grandmother’s 1900 birth record; as was the practice at the time, it noted the religion and age of the mother: “Jewish—23 years old.” Not only that. She found that the name I knew my great-grandmother by was not her given name. It was not Margit Fenyvesi. It was Maria Fleischer, the daughter of Juda Fleischer and Katalin Garfunkel, from Jarosław, now in Poland.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe picture was starting to become much more clear. But I still couldn’t answer the Vancouver rabbi’s question: What was my mother’s Hebrew name?</p><p>This past June, I went to Budapest seeking answers—two and a half years after receiving Andi’s first email. By then, we had lost Magda to COVID. She died before I could ever meet her in person. But we had found at least 36 relatives for a family reunion, cousins from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Hungary. The oldest was 85; the youngest, 5. The small family I had known as a boy had suddenly grown.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy memories of the city from 1978 were gray, dark. I remembered a friend of my grandmother’s closing her curtains when I visited. She didn’t want her neighbors to see that a foreigner was there, because it would raise questions. I remembered the bullet holes in the walls of buildings. And I remembered the sorrow of my grandfather’s sisters, the tears over a son with my same name who hadn’t come back from a labor camp.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis time I arrived not in a cold train station that had filled me with dread, thinking of the railcars hauling Jews out of the city to their destruction. No, this time I arrived in a bright and airy modern airport, where a massive video screen at baggage claim promised nighttime carousing in a vast pool at one of the city’s many spas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI was greeted warmly by Andi, a striking, tall, blond woman wearing a necklace with Jewish charms—a Star of David and Hebrew letters spelling the word life—and her ebullient young daughter. That day I kept pulling a leather-bound notepad out of my back pocket to scratch impressions. “Thinking a lot of my parents and grandparents. Wish they could be here with me,” I would write this simple sentiment many times over the coming days. There was so much I wanted to ask them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat night we saw a city I had never seen. Lively tree-lined streets, with outdoor restaurants overflowing with people. Not the cold gray of winter and empty shop shelves I had experienced years before. After dinner, we walked past Lorant’s last known residence, St. Istvan Park 4. The apartment building had been in the International Ghetto, where the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg had designated a number of buildings as under his protection. Jews there thought that they would be safer, with papers from Sweden and other neutral states. This proved to be only partially true. Anti-Semitic Hungarian fascists brazenly seized Jews from the International Ghetto, dragged them to the nearby Danube, ordered them to remove their shoes, then shot them to death.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter Judith and I said goodbye to Andi and her family, we headed home along the riverbank. It was the kind of summer night when couples and small groups of friends linger, carefree. We were walking and talking, sharing our impressions, when suddenly we stumbled on some small objects next to the river. They were shoes. We realized that we were standing among the bronze shoes of the memorial to the thousands of Jews shot here, a reminder of why so many like my parents had chosen to get as far away as possible from this place. But while I was in Budapest, I still had work to do.</p><p>It’s hard to overstate the size of the Kozma Street Jewish Cemetery. Imagine a place the size of 200 soccer fields, with several hundred thousand graves, dating back to the 1890s. Budapest before the war was a major Jewish center, with hundreds of thousands of Jewish residents. Today the community is a fraction of that size, but the cemetery is still used.</p><p>It was here, in green fields overgrown with vines and other foliage, that I first went to search for my family’s past, together with Judith, my son Ira, Andi, Zsofia, and her husband, Bence. First we visited the grave of Andi’s Granny, Magda, the source of our newfound family ties. Hers was still an earthen mound, fresh, with no stone yet marking it, near the graves of Andi’s father and grandfather. We held tight to each other.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s one thing to look at images of old records online, and another to be standing in the quiet calm of a cemetery, the stones serving as reminders of a community mostly long gone. They have a stubborn presence, even covered in vines. Each, a story. After Andi left us, we ventured deeper. The burrs and thorns from the underbrush wouldn’t be removed from our shoes and clothing for weeks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMap in hand, Zsofia guided us in the sticky heat to the grave of Katalin Fleischer (née Garfunkel), the furthest back I could go on my mother’s matrilineal path. Wrapped in ivy, but still in good condition, the stone rose from the fertile forest floor. Zsofia worked her magic to make the letters carved into the stone emerge, scraping shaving cream across its surface. And there it was, from 1915, more than 100 years ago, still clear as day: her Hebrew name, Gitel bat Rachel. It was impossible to look away. The proof I had been seeking was etched in stone.</p><p>We had lost Magda, but her family still had her apartment, the apartment where she had grown up with her grandfather. This was the apartment where she had first Skyped with me. The apartment where she said my uncle, Lorant, and grandfather Sandor had visited during the High Holidays.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe building seemed like many others in Budapest, with its solid door onto the street. Except for one thing: a small black swastika newly spray-painted next to the door, under the list of names of people who lived in the building. A sick feeling came over me. But I didn’t want to spoil the moment. Andi just shrugged.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe apartment still felt lived-in, even though it had been many months since Magda’s death. Books still filled the shelves. Pictures of loved ones in happy times were posted near her computer. We felt her absence, and expressed our wish that she could have been with us, our sadness that we were too late. And finally, we took pictures of ourselves together in the one place we knew with certainty that my uncle and grandfather had visited more than 80 years ago.</p>\r\nThe author with Andi's mother Lili, center, and Andi in Granny Magda's apartment in 2022. (Judith Cohn)\r\n<p>There were no traces of Lorant in the apartment, but Andi’s mother knew where we could find them. She works for the Federation of Hungarian Jewish Communities in Budapest and had arranged for us to visit its archive and view his original birth record, along with other family records.</p><p>Remarkably, in 1978, I had walked by this building where the truth of my family history was stored. But I had not known what was inside, and I had not tried to enter. Now, 44 years later, I had returned. The archivist had found the correct page for each record and marked it with a sheet of paper. In this room, the facts were plain. There was no denying them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn my grandfather’s birth record from 1887, what stood out to me was that under his name, Sandor, was his Hebrew name, in Hebrew script, a name I had never heard before: Yehoshua. I had thought his father, Lipot, a printer by trade, had left religion behind. This was to be the first of many surprises. Then we saw the 1920 marriage record of my mother’s parents, and the place of their wedding: Dohany Templom, or Dohany Synagogue, just as my grandmother had told me all those years ago.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen came my mother’s 1921 birth record: Eva Palma. I hadn’t known that for her middle name she carried her own mother’s unusual name. But what was more startling was the field in the document to the right of her name. Here was her Hebrew name. The answer to the question the Vancouver rabbi had asked me 40 years before: Malka Shindel bat Yehoshua ve Perel. She had a Hebrew name. If only I had known. I could have asked her whether she knew she had a Hebrew name. Whether she had ever used it. Whether she knew where it came from.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI knew my grandfather Sandor was not a religious man. But here, at the birth of his first child, he had given her a Hebrew name. Not all the other children’s birth records on the same page included a Hebrew name. But for Eva Palma, there it was. With tears in my eyes, I explained to the archivist that I had converted to Judaism because I hadn’t known, or at least hadn’t been able to prove, my mother’s Jewish identity. And yet here it was, in black and white, in a building I had stood near 40 years earlier, before my wedding, long before my mother died. Now I could no longer ask her questions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe archivist was unmoved. In Hungarian, she told Andi, “All the Americans say stuff like that.” Hers is a room where, apparently, mysteries are often revealed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI wrote to Rabbi William Lebeau, who’d overseen my conversion and with whom I had stayed in touch, to tell him about my discoveries. “As I think I must have said to you, one becomes Jewish by being born of a Jewish mother or by conversion,” he responded. “The status of a person via either path is a Jew with equal status one to the other. Your Jewishness was always equal to my own … Your having gone through an unnecessary conversion is a great opening to your Jewish story, but the revelation of the conclusive proof of your birth origin takes the story to a wonderful conclusion.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat was how I felt. No regrets about the conversion. It had set Judith and me on a shared path and strengthened our bond. But now I was no longer the son of Abraham and Sarah, the name all who go through conversion are given. So who was I? What was my Hebrew name?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe answer came in my exchange with the rabbi, in response to my question about whether I could now use my Hebrew name to tie myself to my own family. “You can/should,” he replied.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the time I was a teenager, I had felt that something had been lost because my family’s Jewish past remained hidden from me. Here, in Budapest, I understood better that it may have been done with the best of intentions: to prevent my brother and me from suffering anything like what my family had experienced and witnessed in Hungary. I believe that the best way to respond to our history, to honor those who have been lost, is to connect the generations, not to allow the chain of generations to be broken.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow I would do so with my own Hebrew name.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“When called to the Torah and for any other time [that] using the Hebrew name is required, you are to be known as Yonatan ben Reuven ve Malka Shindel,” Rabbi Lebeau told me. The stories of Jewish families and individuals are complex, he wrote. The Shoah, or the Holocaust, and the anti-Semitism that endured before and after the war shaped those stories and how we understand ourselves today. Mine is just one story, and it is not unique. Jewish history is filled with stories like mine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt turned out that of the 29 Steins who attended the reunion, only one cousin, his four children, and my oldest child, Ira, had been raised Jewish from birth. Being Jewish had been a secret for many of us. The secret for some. Known, and to be kept private, for others. At best, little discussed. Until Andi’s email, it had been easiest to keep it that way.</p><p>By the end of the trip, we had much cause for celebration. A family cast asunder by the Second World War had reunited. Some whose direct ancestors had left Europe long before the war and believed those who remained had been lost. Some who’d left after the Shoah to start new lives in new worlds and had lost touch with those who remained. And some who’d stayed and never knew about the lives of family members in distant lands. We had been lost to one another. And now it felt like we had been found. “I don’t think this is the end,” my new American cousin Lisa Stein told the group, gathered at a hotel in Budapest for our final dinner. “I think this is the beginning.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Next year in Jerusalem!” one of her sisters responded. Many in the group emphatically repeated those words, just as we do at the end of the Passover seder. I could never have imagined, when Andi’s email arrived asking about my uncle, Lorant, that it would result in this.</p><p>But there was one more step I had to take.</p><p>A journey that started with a question about Lorant’s life needed to end where he’d died. No one from my family had been to Buchenwald since the war. The camp is only five miles from Weimar, a cultural capital of Germany, home of the writers Goethe and Schiller, home of the Bauhaus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was there, in a charming city of large trees and stately houses, that I first saw the name Buchenwald. It was on a bus sign, announcing its destination, just like any other bus sign does. I was shocked by how ordinary it seemed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe arrived at the camp on a gray weekday. The sprawling parking lot was almost empty. Few visitors were in sight. On the surface, it seemed much like many other tourist sites: a cafeteria, restrooms, and a bookstore. But I wasn’t prepared for what I would find. There’s no way a person can be.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot for its sheer scale. Not for its emptiness. Not for the birdsong or the grass waving in the wind or the trees, the trees everywhere. Not for how peaceful it seemed. Or for the grim facts presented so starkly. We were met by Jan Malecha, a guide deeply knowledgeable about Buchenwald who had done research into Lorant’s two and a half months there. The Nazis kept detailed records of each prisoner. Some things we can know. Some we can only imagine. We knew this was where his life had ended. We could only imagine, with the help of Jan, what he and others had experienced.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe walked to where the train carrying Lorant would likely have arrived. Followed the path he and the other 1,912 Jewish men from Budapest on his transport would have tread. We saw the brick crematorium etched against the gray sky. Jan told us about the German company in the nearby town of Erfurt, a place where Jews had lived for at least 1,000 years, that designed and built the crematorium ovens for Buchenwald, capable of consuming 300 bodies in a day. The firm had done the same for Auschwitz and Dachau.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuchenwald was good business for many. It was a place for profit. The forested hilltop was visible from a great distance, and its subcamps were spread around the region. Prisoners sometimes marched through the streets of Weimar from its train station to Buchenwald even after the Germans forced the prisoners to build a rail line to the camp. The camp was no secret to the local residents.</p>\r\nThe author stands on the train platform with a guide at Buchenwald in 2022. (Judith Cohn)\r\n<p>Lorant was initially confined in a tent in the infamous “Little Camp,” of which almost nothing remains, except traces of the latrine and fruit trees probably planted by the Nazis to supply food for the SS. The language that present-day Buchenwald uses to describe the Little Camp, also known as the Jewish Camp, is unflinching: “Conditions were barbaric. Windowless stables with dirt floors intended to house 50 horses at times contained nearly 2,000 people. There was no running water, no sanitation, and virtually no heat in the stables.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA cold wind whipped across the grass as we walked. The Little Camp—out of sight of Weimar—was where the conditions were the harshest, the coldest, Jan told us. In the first 100 days of 1945 alone, 6,000 inmates died there of starvation. Over that same period, the Nazis deliberately killed sick, weak, and dying inmates in Block 61 of the Little Camp, according to one of the signs. The camp was “the place of deepest despair” at Buchenwald, as it is described there today. After the war it was “totally obliterated and allowed to be overgrown with trees and brush.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJan told us that on December 30, 1944, Lorant had been taken to one of the subcamps, Berga/Elster, about 60 miles away. He was held there until the end of February 1945. By then, Budapest, his home city, had already been liberated. His family was already safe. At Berga/Elster, Jews were forced to do the heavy, dirty work of removing rubble after explosions blasted tunnels into the mountain. The Nazis’ plan was to build a synthetic-oil plant that would be protected from Allied bombers. Eventually Lorant was transported back from Berga/Elster back to the Little Camp; why and how is not known.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe know Block 61 was where Lorant died, on March 14, 1945. We know that this was the site of mass murder, where Nazis injected Jews with phenol and then lied about their deaths. We’ll never know whether Lorant died of dysentery, as his death report says, or whether he was injected with poison. We do know he was 21 years old.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe also know that accountability after the war for the crimes committed at Buchenwald was almost nonexistent. Nine thousand people worked there. Only 79 were ever convicted for what they had done. Fifty-six thousand prisoners died.</p><p>Lorant’s body, we were told, was buried in one of several mass graves—one of thousands of prisoners buried there. Standing so close to where he was buried, so close for the first time, I felt I could talk with Lorant. You are not forgotten, I said. I wanted him to know that his name alone had brought strangers together as family. The Steins. From the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Hungary. Even 80 years later, even with all who knew you gone, I told him, you live on.</p>",

        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/09/mrna-covid-vaccine-booster-lymphoma-cancer/671308/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "<p>O</p><p>n September 22 of last year, Michel Goldman, a Belgian immunologist and one of Europe’s best-known champions of medical research, walked into a clinic near his house, rolled up his sleeve, and had a booster shot delivered to his arm. He knew he’d need it more than most.</p><p>Just a few weeks earlier, Michel, 67, had been to see his younger brother, Serge, the head of nuclear medicine at the hospital of the Université Libre de Bruxelles, where both men are professors. Michel was having night sweats, and he could feel swollen lymph nodes in his neck, so his brother brought him in for a full-body CT scan. When the images came through to Serge’s computer they revealed a smattering of inky spots, bunched near Michel’s left armpit and running up along his neck. It was cancer of the immune system—lymphoma.</p><p>Given his own area of expertise, Michel understood this meant he’d soon be immunocompromised by chemotherapy. With another winter on the way—and perhaps another wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections—that meant he had just a narrow window of opportunity in which his body would respond in full to COVID vaccination. Having received two doses of Pfizer the prior spring, Michel quickly went to get his third. If he was about to spend months absorbing poison as he tried to beat a deadly cancer, at least he’d have the most protection possible from the pandemic.</p><p>Within a few days, though, Michel was somehow feeling even worse. His night sweats got much more intense, and he found himself—quite out of character—taking afternoon naps. Most worryingly, his lymph nodes were even more swollen than before. He conferred with Serge again, and they set up another body scan for September 30, six days before Michel was scheduled to start his cancer treatment. Once again he sat in the radiology waiting room while his brother waited for the pictures to appear on his computer.</p><p>Serge’s bushy eyebrows furrowed when he spoke with Michel after having seen the scans. (“I will always remember his face, it was just incredible,” Michel told me.) The pictures showed a brand-new barrage of cancer lesions—so many spots that it looked like someone had set off fireworks inside Michel’s body. More than that, the lesions were now prominent on both sides of the body, with new clusters blooming in Michel’s right armpit in particular, and along the right side of his neck.</p><p>When Michel’s hematologist saw the scan, she told him to report directly to the nearest hospital pharmacy. He’d have to start on steroid pills right away, she told him. Such a swift progression for lymphoma in just three weeks was highly unusual, and he could not risk waiting a single day longer.</p><p>As he followed these instructions, Michel felt a gnawing worry that his COVID booster shot had somehow made him sicker. His brother was harboring a similar concern. The asymmetrical cluster of cancerous nodes around Michel’s left armpit on the initial scan had already seemed “a bit disturbing,” as his brother said; especially given that Michel’s first two doses of vaccine had been delivered on that side. Now he’d had a booster shot in the other arm, and the cancer’s asymmetry was flipped.</p><p>The brothers knew this might be just an eerie coincidence. But they couldn’t shake the feeling that Michel had experienced what would be a very rare yet life-threatening side effect of COVID vaccination. For a doctor who had spent four decades studying and advocating for new medicines, that feeling would unfold into many months of deliberation and self-doubt. Michel used to run an institute for vaccine-technology research, and he’s spoken out to reassure the public about the safety of the COVID vaccines, and of the mRNA vaccines in particular. In December 2020, he told an interviewer that “if there was a real problem with the technology, we’d have seen it before now for sure.” His “main concern,” he continued, was that people would use the mere possibility of side effects “as an argument not to be vaccinated.”</p><p>But now that possibility appeared to be splattered all across his medical charts. Michel Goldman, champion of the mRNA vaccines, suspected that he was their unlucky victim.</p><p>I happened to speak with Michel by phone in April 2021, months before his cancer diagnosis. I’d called him to discuss another potential side effect of COVID vaccination, one associated in particular with the shot made by AstraZeneca. By that point, 220 people who’d received that vaccine had developed an unusual—and very dangerous—blood-clotting syndrome, which was characterized by an atypical low platelet count. At least seven people in the U.K. alone had died of the complication. Michel patiently laid out the different mechanisms that might explain this strange condition. But he was quick to add that the mRNA COVID vaccines were built in a way that could mitigate the risk of this particular problem.</p><p>Michel currently leads the I3h institute, a university hub aimed at assisting in drug-design projects; in an earlier posting, he headed a $2 billion European endeavor to accelerate the research of new medicines. As such, he’s spent many years attending to the possible risks—even tiny ones—of novel medical treatments. He has raised awareness about the iron overload that used to afflict dialysis patients before the advent of a drug known as erythropoietin, for example; and looked for signs of “cytokine storms” in kidney-transplant recipients who received monoclonal-antibody treatments. So when a plethora of new vaccines for COVID emerged in the first year of the pandemic, he was watching very closely.</p><p>When we talked about the potential side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine last year, Michel made it clear that, in the big picture, any chance of serious complications from the shots would be orders of magnitude smaller than the chance of complications from the pandemic illness itself. If COVID vaccines caused clotting disorders or myocarditis in a tiny percentage of those who received them, he assured me, COVID would lead to stroke or heart inflammation in a much larger group.</p><p>The risks and benefits for each vaccine should be weighed against each other, he continued. If AstraZeneca were the only option, then its protection might be worth the very small risk of developing a rare blood disorder. But given the availability of Pfizer, Moderna, and other COVID vaccines, many people could opt for a safer alternative.</p><p>Now that risk-benefit calculation has been thrust upon him in a personal and terrifying way. By the time we spoke again, he’d become a cancer patient who suspected that his mRNA vaccine might have made things worse. Michel is reserved by nature, prone to making matter-of-fact remarks rather than emotive musings. In this case, I found him more guarded than ever, and I could tell he’d struggled over how he should describe his own experience—or, indeed, whether he should even be describing it at all. Perhaps his hypothesis was wrong, and the course of his cancer had had nothing to do with the shots. Or maybe the cancer and the mRNA vaccine were connected, but the risk of getting immunized was still just a tiny speck beside the benefits. Applying the same logic that he’d used before, he decided it made sense to go public with this theory. If other people with the same lymphoma felt the need to hedge their bets, they might consider holding off on the Pfizer and Moderna shots.</p><p>Michel knew that by speaking out about another potential rare effect—especially without hard proof—he’d be introducing a different kind of risk. Recent years had already seen a rise in anti-vaccine disinformation, and protesters have thrown menstrual blood at state legislators and issued death threats to public-health officials. Fearmongers have made the problem worse by citing scary-sounding data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a U.S. government database of possible side effects from immunizations, with insufficient context. In Europe, French police used tear gas to disperse anti-vaccine protesters who were aiming fireworks at officers in July of 2021; a vaccination center was set ablaze in Poland a few weeks later. Michel was well aware of all this trend; in fact, he’d been sounding the alarm about the spread of vaccine misinformation online before the pandemic even started. If he shared his own experience of cancer, might that make the problem worse?</p><p>This was not a reason to remain silent, Michel eventually decided. It was a reason to speak carefully.</p><p>First things first: Before Michel could tackle the conundrum of going public with this theory, he’d need to get his cancer under control. On October 6, he sat in a hospital room in Brussels, feeling quite afraid while nurses hooked up an infusion line to the catheter that had been surgically embedded near his collarbone. After so many years spent working as a doctor, he was suddenly a patient. People with his kind of lymphoma have only about a 30 percent chance of surviving longer than five years, and the aggressiveness of his disease meant that the medications would have to be intense. The drug that Michel was getting for his first infusion, called brentuximab vedotin, would be the newest and potentially riskiest in his regimen. Side effects can include breathing difficulties, blistering skin, and even permanent nerve damage.</p><p>Michel didn’t end up having any of those symptoms, but he did feel very weak. He convalesced at home, and for several days felt unable to do much of anything. But as soon as a bit of his strength came back, he started going through the cancer-research literature. He had several weeks until the next infusion, which meant he had several weeks to figure out whether the vaccine really had quickened his lymphoma, and whether other cancer patients might be in danger from the shots. He was used to reading stacks of science papers for his work; now he did so at an even faster pace.</p><p>Michel’s cancer was the kind that attacks the body’s T cells, which coordinate the immune response to invading pathogens. T-cell lymphomas come in roughly 30 different subtypes; Michel’s, known as angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, affects what are called follicular helper T cells, which hang out in the tonsils and the lymph nodes, among other tissues. Follicular helper T cells serve a crucial role in the cascade of events to protect the body after dangerous invaders have arrived. That process begins with dendritic cells, which identify a virus or other pathogen and present examples of it to the rest of the immune system. The helper T cells do just as their name suggests: They help pass that message along to B cells, which end up making protective antibodies against the virus.</p><p>Michel had recently learned that mRNA vaccines, such as the Pfizer shots he had received, are especially effective at generating that message, and spurring its passage through the helper T cells. Some researchers argue that the COVID vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been more protective than others for exactly this reason: They rev up those cells with extra oomph. Now Michel began to wonder whether that oomph could, in ultrarare cases, turn out to be a liability. Perhaps the shots gave such a jolt to his helper T cells that they went berserk. If they were prone to forming tumors, or if they were already cancerous, then overstimulation could have made the problem even worse.</p><p>As the days went by, Michel found other clues suggesting that the link was real, and that the mRNA vaccines might be risky for a specific subset of the population. He learned that body scans of some of those who get vaccines, including cancer patients, have shown heightened activity in the lymph nodes near the armpit on the side where the shot was received. He also came across another, very important clue. In 2018, a team of researchers based at Columbia University’s Institute for Cancer Genetics had published an intriguing study using mice with a pair of gene mutations that, when they co-occur, predispose T cells to go rogue. (Michel’s tumor, which had been sequenced by this point, showed the same two mutations.) When these mice were injected with sheep red-blood cells—as an experimental stand-in for invading microbes—the animals developed the subtype of lymphoma that was diagnosed in Michel.</p><p>Now Michel had a theory to explain the bleak coincidence that had befallen him. Serge agreed that it made sense. The brothers had co-written research papers in the past, including ones on the use of stem cells for heart repair and dendritic-cell vaccines for cancer. It was time for them to write another.</p><p>On October 20 of last year, Hans-Georg Eichler, a clinical pharmacologist and former senior medical officer for the European Medicines Agency, opened up his email to find a message from Michel. The two have known each other for more than a decade. “I hope that you are well,” the message started, “which is not really my case ...” Michel had pasted in a link to a medical report, not yet published. “I am curious to hear your thoughts,” he wrote.</p><p>The paper, titled “Rapid Progression of Angioimmunoblastic T Cell Lymphoma Following BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine Booster Shot” and credited to Serge Goldman, Michel Goldman, and six of their Belgian colleagues, would run in the journal Frontiers in Medicine a few weeks later. (Michel is that journal’s editor in chief; he recused himself from the process of editing and peer review.) It begins by describing “a 66-year-old man with no significant medical history” who had been diagnosed with lymphoma that worsened following a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine. The Goldmans’ unusual connection to the data—the fact that the 66-year-old man in question was Michel—comes across obliquely in the text. An ethics statement, printed at the end of the case report, includes the line: “Being one of the authors, the patient consented to the publication.”</p><p>[Read: A prominent vaccine skeptic returns to Twitter]</p><p>Eichler, who had closely followed the furor over vaccine-associated blood-clot disorders the previous spring, replied that evening: “I have read the paper and am very impressed … It is the most responsible and courageous thing you could do under the worst possible circumstances.”</p><p>“I would say that 95 percent of the reactions were extremely friendly,” Michel told me later. But as he’d feared, anti-vaccine activists picked up on the story. “The lymph nodes of those who have taken these shots are exploding, burgeoning, and bulging with this toxic bioweapon,” a right-wing influencer named Jane Ruby wrote on Telegram beneath a screenshot of Michel’s CT scans, which had appeared in his published paper (and are reproduced in this article). “LYMPHOMA - That’s right… Cancer of the lymphatic system … STOP THIS FROM GETTING INTO BABIES AND CHILDREN!!!!!” Ruby’s claims were amplified on Natural News, among other anti-vaccination sites where, again, the very images that Michel’s brother had used to diagnose his illness were presented as shocking evidence of vaccination’s dangers. “PHOTOS: LYMPHOMA CANCER EXPLODING IN THE BOOSTED,” one website said.</p>\r\nMichel Goldman’s CT scan (Courtesy Michel Goldman)\r\n<p>When I told Michel about these online posts, he shook his head in disappointment. “They’re looking for anything to support their crazy vision,” he said. “It makes me sad about the world in which we are living.” That’s not to say he was surprised. Michel knew, for instance, that medical experts have dispelled false rumors about vaccines infecting people with COVID-19. He told me that he’d obsessed over getting the tone of the manuscript exactly right, so as not to fuel vaccine skepticism. He was careful, for example, to describe the vaccine as possibly “inducing” the “progression” of his cancer—rather than “causing” it to surface. “I spent hours and hours,” he said. “I’ve never spent so much time on details in a paper.”</p><p>Extremely rare cases like Michel’s create a tricky terrain for science communication. Even a clinical trial with thousands of participants might never turn up a single case of someone's cancer worsening after vaccination. In that context, experts can't assign a statistical estimate of the risk across the wider population. Science journalists may be wary of reporting on the story for that reason. In fact, when Michel first told me about his cancer and about the paper he’d written with his brother, I said that I couldn’t write about it. I was worried that some readers would misinterpret my article, and mistakenly see it as a reason not to get vaccinated. As I write this, I’m still concerned that you might do exactly that.</p><p>But the scientific literature is sprinkled with odd cases like Michel’s that have puzzled doctors. The Goldmans’ paper follows earlier isolated reports suggesting a possible link between COVID-19 vaccination and lymphoma. Aaron Mangold, who heads the division of clinical dermatology at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, co-authored a paper published in May 2021 about a patient whose rare skin lymphoma recurred after his initial Pfizer shot. The tumorous ulcer appeared in the armpit of the same arm in which the man had received the injection, and then regressed spontaneously. A second shot of the vaccine, delivered three weeks later, produced no further lesions, Mangold told me, and the whole ordeal could have simply been a coincidence. He felt that he’d been “threading the needle” to go public with the case report given that uncertainty.</p><p>[Read: The differences between the vaccines matter]</p><p>Ladan Zand, a nephrologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, faced the same conundrum when she co-authored a paper last year detailing five patients who had a relapse of kidney disease following mRNA COVID vaccination. Her team also documented eight patients who were newly diagnosed with the disease, known as glomerulonephritis, after receiving the shot. But Zand cautions that those patients might have had underlying kidney disease and not been aware of it. People infected with the novel coronavirus also show higher rates of kidney-function decline over time. “I spend half of my visits now asking patients to get vaccinated,” she said. “If you were to compare the risks and benefits, the benefits of the vaccine way outweigh the risk of rare entities that, for the most part, seem to be self-limiting.”</p><p>William Murphy, an immunologist at UC Davis, told me that Michel’s before-and-after CT scans were fascinating in the context of the mouse study from Columbia. The cancer’s behavior certainly appeared to be related to the vaccine, he said, “given the huge difference in the scans of the tumor progression in a very short period of time.” But one can’t be certain, however striking the data. It’s just a case report, he added—one patient.</p><p>The Goldmans’ paper, for its part, notes that it would be “premature” to extrapolate the findings from Michel to other patients with the same kind of cancer, and that the link, even if it were proved, should not discourage general uptake of “much-needed vaccines.” An unusual paragraph tacked onto the bottom of the article underscores the point. Marked “Patient Perspective,” and written in the third person, it notes that Michel himself “remains convinced that mRNA vaccines represent very efficient products with a favorable benefit-risk ratio,” and that he hopes the report will encourage further research.</p><p>In mid-February, Michel spiked a sudden fever. COVID had finally caught up with him.</p><p>Given that he was immunocompromised by six rounds of cancer chemotherapy, Michel knew that his doctors would need to act quickly. He soon received an infusion of the monoclonal-antibody drug sotrovimab, and managed to recover without incident; his lymph nodes stayed blessedly quiet, and there was no resurgence of his cancer. Now he’s eligible for a second booster shot, but he’s not sure whether he should take it. “I don't know what I will do,” he said.</p><p>Would another dose of the vaccine cause another round of cancer lesions? Michel and the scientists who have been in touch with him are still mulling the evidence about whether his original cancer flare was simply a fluke. Steven Horwitz, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering who focuses on the care of patients with lymphoma, has looked more closely at vaccine side effects since hearing about Michel’s case, and feels reassured by what he’s found. “Of our patients who received mRNA COVID vaccines, we have not seen any clearly related and documented relapses or progressions,” he told me via email. Meanwhile, lymphomas and the treatments given for them can weaken the immune system, putting affected patients at higher risk of severe COVID-19 if infected. “Vaccination remains the most effective way to mitigate that risk,” he said.</p><p>I reached out to the makers of the mRNA COVID vaccines to ask about Michel’s case. A representative for Pfizer noted that the company takes such reports “very seriously” but that, “to date, there has been no identified correlation between the vaccine and cancer.” Moderna’s chief medical officer, Paul Burton, told me that the company keeps careful track of safety data and has not found any relationship between vaccination and lymphoma. He also pointed to the case of a 61-year-old woman with cancer of the salivary gland whose tumor shrank to about one-quarter of its original size in the month after she received a second dose of the Moderna vaccine. “Now, did it really regress because the person got a messenger RNA vaccine?” he asked. “I don't know. I think biology is truly a remarkable thing.\"</p><p>While Michel remains unsure about his fourth shot, he has continued to be outspoken on the benefits of vaccination overall, and often speaks to Belgian media on the topic. At the same time, he has become a stronger advocate for broader tracking of adverse events from vaccines—an endeavor he and others in drug development call “pharmacovigilance.” “We need to make sure that some pharmacovigilance programs are powered to detect very, very rare side effects,” Michel told me. Eichler, who was involved in drug regulation for the European Medicines Agency, said that while some doctors may be “aficionados” of randomized controlled trials as the only valid source of medical evidence, other types of information are needed. Michel’s case shows why: You’ve got a patient “who is a professor of medicine, who experiences the side effects and says, ‘Okay, this must be a side effect,’” Eichler said. That “rings the bells. Could Michel have ever come up in an RCT? My answer is probably not.”</p><p>Just a few days before Michel got COVID, he had gone back to Serge’s office for yet another set of full-body CT images, to check the status of his cancer. He sat in his brother’s waiting room, as he had last September, while Serge examined the results. This time, though, Serge’s expression was relaxed. The scans were clear.</p><p>Michel still has to watch out for a recurrence. And as a longtime immunologist and medical innovator, he’s still considering the question of whether a vaccine that is saving tens of millions of lives each year might have put his own in jeopardy. He remains adamant that COVID-19 vaccines are necessary and useful for the vast majority of people. But he wants the discussion about vaccines to be transparent.</p><p>Around the time of his February follow-up, Michel received a message from a doctor who had read his self-referential case report. The doctor’s mother had been diagnosed with the same subtype of lymphoma that Michel has following a COVID booster shot. More recently, he got an email from a woman whose sister had been vaccinated and received that diagnosis the following month. Again, these could be coincidences. Or maybe they are the second and third data points in a growing set. The possible connection between Michel’s lymphoma flare and his COVID-19 vaccination occupies much of his thinking these days. “If it exists, it must be very rare,” he said. But he doesn’t regret going public with his case. “I’m still convinced it was the right thing to do.”</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3659235-what-divergent-crude-oil-and-natural-gas-prices-portend-for-the-eu-and-us/",
        "description": "<p>When Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, forecasters were quick to revise their projections of prices for energy considerably higher in anticipation of supply shortages for both crude oil and natural gas. Europe was widely perceived to be vulnerable to cutbacks in supplies of natural gas from Russia, which accounted for about 40 percent of its energy needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, some forecasts called for the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to double to between $125 -$150 per barrel in response to sanctions that were imposed on Russia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developments since then suggest the European Union (EU) may experience the worst scenario that was envisioned. But the fallout for the U.S. has been better than expected, as the price of WTI has dipped below $90 a barrel. According to a Wall Street Journal report, prices of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Europe have nearly quadrupled over a year ago, and they are eight times higher than their U.S. (Henry Hub) equivalent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the long-term correlation between prices for crude oil and natural gas is fairly low at about 0.25, the magnitude of the price divergence today is unusually high.  Consequently, many people are wondering why it is happening and what it spells for the respective economies and financial markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a previous commentary, I examined the fallout from Russia’s squeeze on natural gas shipments to Europe and the European policy response. The problem is that while the EU agreed on plans in May to reduce its reliance on Russian fuel, they will take years to implement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, European policymakers are scrambling to lessen the burden consumers will face if the squeeze is maintained through the winter. The most urgent need is to curb price increases for electricity and heating fuel. A New York Times article reports that manufacturers are furloughing workers and shutting down production and face spikes in energy bills when contracts expire in October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, the European Commission outlined a plan to redistribute $140 billion of windfall profits from energy companies to consumers and businesses to soften the blow. The plan calls for a cap of 180 euro per megawatt hour on revenue earned by lower-cost non-gas producers of electricity. It would also require coordination with EU member governments that are implementing their own plans. Consequently, it is unclear how effective these measures will be and whether they will lessen inflation that currently stands at 9 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By comparison, the energy picture in the U.S. has improved considerably in the past three months: Gasoline prices at the pump have fallen for 13 weeks in a row, from more than $5 a gallon in June to about $3.70 recently. This, in turn, has contributed to declines in headline inflation and boosted consumer confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what’s behind these price declines and are they likely to continue or be reversed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A commonly held view is they are linked to the decision by the U.S. and 30 other IEA member countries in March to release 60 million barrels of oil strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) to address supply disruptions from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there has been an ongoing debate about the effectiveness of using the SPR in emergencies, a report published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in 2019 concluded that such measures could lower oil prices temporarily. The big unknown, however, is whether the price declines would have occurred if the action was not taken, because higher prices would have resulted in faster inventory accumulation.  Furthermore, prices could rebound once the selling program has ended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond this, a recent report by Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts titled “Finding the Floor” helps to shed light on the structural and cyclical forces at play in the global oil market.  The principal conclusion is that the decline in both Brent and WTI prices is mainly the result of a reduction in demand for oil linked to global economic weakness. “Spot prices have fallen, forward curves have flattened, physical differentials have come in, and refining margins have weakened,” the analysts write. The slowdown in demand has occurred among all the main economic blocs, and the report cites China as a particularly important contributor, with its crude oil imports down by about 2 mb/d from two years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With respect to gasoline prices, the MS report notes that there has been an unprecedented decline in crack (refining) spreads from a peak of $45/bbl in early summer to zero recently, which is very unusual. Another oddity is that crude oil has fallen below the price of coal, which raises the issue of whether it can fall much further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morgan Stanley’s assessment is that the oil market’s structural outlook is one of tightness, but for the time being it is being offset by cyclical weakness. Its base case is that oil prices will stay around current levels into mid-2023. With WTI prices having fallen by about $40/bbl from its peak of $130, the downside risks are limited. But a price surge is unlikely until there is a global economic recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weighing these considerations, my take is that the direct impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is not as bad for the U.S. as was originally believed. One reason is the fallout on Europe has been more severe than expected and will likely result in a European recession as the ECB feels compelled to tighten monetary policy to curb inflation.  Another reason is China’s economy has also slowed more than expected due to weakness in the property sector and the government’s strict COVID-19 policy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main implication for financial markets is that the U.S. dollar is likely to remain strong. First, with core inflation still elevated, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it will continue to raise rates aggressively for a while longer. Second, the U.S. benefits from being energy independent, whereas the EU and China are heavily dependent on imported energy. Thus, the U.S. is likely to experience a favorable shift in the terms of trade (price of exports relative imports) compared to the EU and China. In this respect, the U.S. has been shielded from some of the negative impacts of Russia’s invasion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nicholas Sargen, Ph.D., is an economic consultant for Fort Washington Investment Advisors and is affiliated with the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business.  He has written three books, including “Global Shocks: An Investment Guide for Turbulent Markets.”</p>",

Several men have amputated genitalia,” wrote Synyehubov on Telegram.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 30 bodies found to “have traces of torture” include those of military members and civilians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the remainder of the 436 bodies buried in the mass grave showed “signs of violent death,” according to officials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United Nations released a report the same day confirming evidence of torture in Izyum, in addition to sexual violence and “cruel and inhuman treatment.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry into Ukraine found that the Russian army forced family members to watch as they committed crimes against their fellow Ukrainians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Synyehubov claimed that there are other burial sites around the Kharkiv region, including three more that officials have discovered since the territory has been liberated from Russian troops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Izyum was recaptured by the Ukrainian military earlier this month as its troops launched a successful counteroffensive that pushed the Russians out of multiple key cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Each of the bodies found is a separate story,” Synyehubov said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And we will find out the circumstances of each person's death, so that their relatives and friends will learn the truth, and the murderers will be punished.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commented on the “torture chamber” in Izyum in an address last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Russia has repeated in Izyum what it did in Bucha,” Zelensky said, referring to the mass burial sites found in the latter city after Russian withdrawal earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And now we have just begun to learn the full truth about what was happening in Kharkiv region at that time.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>A Ramsey County judge is disputing the way the news media and Gov. Tim Walz are representing his actions in a 2021 court case involving Feeding Our Future, the group at the center of fraud allegations tied to hundreds of millions of dollars of federal money meant to pay for meals for Minnesota school children.</p><p>In a statement issued by the Minnesota Judicial Branch late Friday, Judge John H. Guthmann said Walz made “inaccurate statements“ and that he never ordered the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) to resume payments to the group after officials suspended the payments in March of 2021. As a result of that suspension, Feeding Our Future filed a motion asking Guthmann to resume payments and order the state to pay sanctions. </p><p>Guthmann’s statement says the education department voluntarily resumed payments.</p><p>Federal prosecutors this week announced charges against 48 people involved in what they said was a $250 million embezzlement scheme run through Feeding Our Future. Some of those involved are alleged to have used the child nutrition money on jewelry, property and travel.</p><p>On Thursday, Walz said he was “speechless” when Guthmann ruled in favor of Feeding Our Future in April of 2021.</p><p>“I would hope there would be an investigation into that,” Walz said when asked if Guthmann should resign.  </p><p>On Friday night the governor’s office issued a statement responding to Guthmann.</p><p>“Feeding Our Future demanded that MDE make payments, and the court made it clear that if MDE were to continue the legal fight to withhold payments, MDE would incur sanctions and legal penalties,” the statement said. “The court held MDE in contempt for not processing Feeding Our Future applications.”</p><p>In June of 2021, Guthmann said in an order that the department was in contempt of court and ordered MDE to pay a sanction of $35,750 to Feeding Our Future.</p><p>\"MDE cannot divide the application process into pieces and take as long as it wishes at every stage of the process except the last,\" Guthmann wrote in that order.</p><p>Walz has said when the education department was unsuccessful in court, it went to the FBI, which began the process that ultimately led to the criminal charges. </p><p>“We caught this fraud. We caught it very early. We alerted the right people. We were taken to court. We were sued. We were threatened with going to jail. We stuck with it,” Walz said on Thursday. “We got the FBI out there, and we have 48 people under indictment. And that's the way it's supposed to work.”</p><p>Republicans were quick to point to Guthmann’s statement as evidence that Walz was derelict in responding to the fraud.</p><p>The governor’s Republican opponent Scott Jensen said Guthmann “put his career on the line in the defense of truth, justice, and Minnesota children” by calling out what Jensen said were lies.</p><p>“While I’ve called for Tim Walz to either fire his Education Commissioner or ask for her resignation, we have moved beyond that,” Jensen said in a statement. “The lies need to stop, and Tim Walz needs to come clean to not only the local media, but every Minnesota child who had to go hungry due to his administration’s incompetence. At this point in time, we need to know: what did Tim Walz know and when did he know it?”</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Justin Berl/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>... and the Cubs recorded their fourth straight one-run win.</p> <p>Well, that was... something, all right.</p>\n<p>The Cubs defeated the Pirates 6-5 Friday evening, their fourth consecutive victory, all by one run. And they did it with a bit of power, a bit of small ball and a couple bits of relief pitching that nearly blew up, but in the end finished things off.</p>\n<p>The game ran three hours, 33 minutes, included 356 pitches (171 by Cubs pitchers and 185 by Pirates hurlers), which is about 100 more than an average nine-inning game. Sixteen walks (nine by Pirates pitchers, seven by Cubs pitchers) extended this game late into the Pittsburgh evening, but eventually the result was in the Cubs’ favor.</p>\n<p>Let’s rewind to the start of this game, which had three lead changes and was tied two other times.</p>\n<p>The Pirates scored first, in the bottom of the first, and as has been the case for Javier Assad too many times in his brief MLB career to date, a walk started things off. Oneil Cruz drew the walk, stole second and scored on a single by Bryan Reynolds.</p>\n<p>But the Cubs got that run back and one more in the top of the second. Ian Happ doubled to lead off the inning. That was his 40th, and so he became the first Cub to have 40 doubles in a season since Javier Báez did it in 2018. The last Cub to have more than 40 doubles in a season was Anthony Rizzo, who had 43 in 2016.</p>\n<p>Patrick Wisdom followed the double with this colossal home run, his 24th [VIDEO].</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Did I mention that ball was crushed?</p>\n\n\n<p>#Cubs 2 @ #Pirates 1 [T2-0o]:<br /><br />Patrick Wisdom homers (24): fly ball to LF (2-run)<br /><br />Hit: 422ft, 109.9mph, 37° <br /><br />Pitch: 82.6mph Slider (RHP Bryse Wilson, 20)</p>— Home Run Tracker (@DingerTracker) September 23, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>That lead lasted only a few minutes, as the Pirates tied the game on a home run from Chicago-area native Jack Suwinski, his 17th. It might have been worse in that second inning if not for this nice diving catch by Zach McKinstry [VIDEO].</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The Pirates took the lead in the third. A throwing error by Esteban Quiroz (which the Cubs challenged, and I don’t know why, the runner was pretty obviously safe) that allowed Reynolds to reach was followed, one out later, by a pair of run-scoring doubles off Assad.</p>\n<p>I want to like Assad’s chances to stick in the big leagues, really I do, but he’s just not throwing enough strikes and when he does, they’re being hit hard. He threw 91 pitches (only 56 strikes) and left the game after the fourth inning. </p>\n<p>Michael Rucker threw a scoreless fifth and then the Cubs got to work on small ball in the sixth. Wisdom led off with a walk and was wild-pitched to second. One out later, P.J. Higgins also drew a walk, and a single by Jared Young loaded the bases.</p>\n<p>Franmil Reyes was sent up to bat for Michael Hermosillo, because why not see if he can open up things to a big lead with a grand slam?</p>\n<p>Instead, this happened [VIDEO].</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Yes, another walk, making it 4-3 Pirates. The Bucs changed pitchers and brought in Manny Banuelos, but it didn’t matter, because the next hitter, McKinstry, also walked. The highlights folks apparently got tired of posting bases-loaded walk videos, because I can’t show you that one. The game is now tied 4-4, and then Quiroz hit a ball... well, watch [VIDEO].</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Statcast says that ball had an exit velocity of 72.8 miles per hour. Only five Cubs who put a ball in play in this game had a lower exit velocity. Statcast also says that high bounce was a launch angle of -65.8, which is just plain silly. It went far enough for an RBI single and the Cubs had the lead.</p>\n<p>The bases are still loaded, and David Bote struck out for the second out. While Ian Happ was batting, Banuelos uncorked a wild pitch — but it bounced right back to him and Christopher Morel, who had run for Reyes, was tagged out. Here’s a better description, plus video:</p>\n\n\n<p>In one of the oddest plays you'll ever see, @Pirates P Manny Bañuelos throws a 'wild pitch' which the catcher can't find, so #Cubs CF Christopher Morel tries to score from 3rd, however the ball had popped straight up, then Bañuelos caught it and tagged Morel out.@Cubs #GoCubsGo pic.twitter.com/zSTWzVXfCg</p>— Billy Krumb (@ClubhouseCancer) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Rucker threw another scoreless inning — real nice outing for him — and then we had some more silly season in the seventh. With one out, Wisdom swung and missed to strike out. Somehow, that resulted in plate umpire Ryan Wills tossing Wisdom. I didn’t get it and neither did Ryan Dempster on the Marquee broadcast. Dempster said that Wills has to have a thicker skin in that situation, and he’s right. Here are Wisdom’s postgame comments, which clear things up, a little:</p>\n\n\n<p>Patrick Wisdom was \"absolutely\" surprised by ejection tonight. After striking out he told home plate ump he didn't like his call on first pitch of AB as he walked away: \"Given the circumstances, I feel like I'm allowed to voice my opinion on a call. He obviously didn't like it.\"</p>— Meghan Montemurro (@M_Montemurro) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the pitch sequence — looks like pitch 1 was a strike, though borderline:</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>Manuel Rodriguez relieved Rucker to start the eighth, and with one out Reynolds homered off him, his 25th. It seems like Reynolds has hit 25 career homers against the Cubs, but in reality, that’s just seven in 55 games.</p>\n<p>So it’s tied heading to the eighth, and then the Cubs took the lead back with more small ball. Higgins singled and Young walked, and Morel laid down a nice sac bunt to move both runners into scoring position.</p>\n<p>As noted on Marquee’s broadcast:</p>\n<p>Cubs sacrifice bunts, April-August 2022: 10<br />Cubs sacrifice bunts, September 2022: 9</p>\n<p>It is, I suppose, a useful skill to hone in games like this, in case you need it later. This was a good situation to do it; the Cubs are now tied for fourth in MLB with 19 sac bunts this year. (The league average is 12 and one team, the Braves, still has none.)</p>\n<p>McKinstry followed with an infield grounder but Higgins was thrown out at the plate. With runners thus on first and third, Quiroz drove in the lead run [VIDEO].</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Rodriguez retired the Pirates in order in the eighth and the Cubs didn’t score in the ninth, so it was left up to Erich Uelmen to nail down the save. It was his first MLB ninth-inning save opportunity.</p>\n<p>This one would not be easy. Ji Hwan Bae, making his MLB debut in this game, singled with one out, his first MLB hit. Uelmen retired Oneil Cruz on a long fly to left. One out to go, but Bae had stolen second during that at-bat, putting the tying run in scoring position.</p>\n<p>This game still did not want to let go. Uelmen ran a 3-1 count on Reynolds and then, wisely, he was intentionally walked — I say “wisely” even though that was the winning run, because Reynolds already had two hits in this game, including a home run. Unfortunately, then Rodolfo Castro was unintentionally walked to load the bases.</p>\n<p>Uelmen, at last, put the game to bed [VIDEO].</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Congrats to Erich Uelmen on his first MLB save, and to the Cubs for their fourth straight one-run win on the road. The last time a Cubs team did that was June 17-20, 1989, over the Expos and Pirates. The franchise record for consecutive one-run road wins is five, set from April 27-30, 1907, which included a doubleheader sweep, both wins by one run. (NOTE: The streaks indicated here are when all the games were consecutive. The Cubs had a six-game streak of one-run road wins in 1975, but there were other road games in the interim that weren’t one-run games.) </p>\n<p>Other notes: The win also improved the Cubs’ overall record in one-run games to 24-26, evened up their September mark at 10-10 and pushed them ahead of the still-contending Brewers post-All-Star break (Cubs, 31-28; Brewers, 30-28 since the break). It also means the Cubs can finish with fewer than 90 losses by going 7-4 the rest of the way, a mark that’s certainly possible.</p>\n<p>Saturday, the Cubs will go for five wins in a row and the series win over the Pirates. Wade Miley will take the mound for the Cubs and Johan Oviedo will get the call for Pittsburgh. Game time is again 5:35 p.m. CT and TV coverage will be via Marquee Sports Network. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

        "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-russia-war-invasion-crimea/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication",
        "description": "<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy charged Russia with deliberately targeting Ukrainians in occupied parts of Ukraine in Moscow’s call-up of more soldiers for its invasion of the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zelenskyy said that in Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, as well as “other parts of Ukraine, which they so far control,” Russians and separatist loyalists are seeking to carry out a “criminal mobilization” of local men into the Russian army. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In Crimea, in areas with dense populations of qırımlılar [Crimean Tatars], they are trying to find and mobilize as many men as possible,” the president said in his televised address on Friday night. “This is a deliberate attempt by Russia to destroy the Crimean Tatar people, this is a deliberate attempt by the aggressor state to take the lives of as many residents of the territory the Russian troops invaded as possible.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zelenskyy urged Ukrainians to resist.<br /> <br />“I have a simple request to all our people in the temporarily occupied territories: Do the most important thing – save your own lives, and help us weaken and destroy the occupiers,” Zelenskyy said. “Hide from the Russian mobilization by any means. Avoid conscription letters. Try to get to the free territory of Ukraine.” <br /> <br />He said that anyone who does get drafted into the Russian army should sabotage the enemy’s activities and provide the Ukrainian side with any important information about the Russian forces, such as the location of their bases, headquarters and munitions warehouses. <br /> <br />“And at the first available opportunity, switch to our positions,” Zelenskyy said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyiv is far from panicking about Russia’s mobilization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, tweeted earlier this week that Ukraine “will destroy anyone who comes with weapons to our land, whether voluntarily or by mobilization.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former adviser to Zelenskyy who was Ukrainian defense minister in 2019-2020, believes that newly recruited troops to the Russian army are unlikely to have proper training and therefore “will not fight qualitatively.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’ve seen that before. Time is necessary to prepare a serviceman well. No one will spend it,” Zagorodnyuk said in an interview with POLITICO. “If they [Russians] train servicemen for two weeks and throw them into battle after that, nothing good will come of it for them.”<br /><br />Another problem for Moscow is that many Russian servicemen “don’t understand what they’re doing in Ukraine,” Zagorodnyuk said. “We’ve seen this many times. When they encounter the brutality of war, when they realize that they are being forced to kill civilians, to bomb peaceful cities, … they get confused, they fight with absolutely no motivation,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zelenskyy’s statement on Friday echoed his message to potential Russian conscripts earlier this week. Russian citizens who want to avoid going to war should protest against the mobilization and Putin’s regime — “fight back,” “run away,” he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine’s military command said on Saturday that over 53,000 Russian troops have been killed since the start of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, when Russia deployed around 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Estimates by Western intelligence are significantly lower. In July, CIA Director William Burns said the U.S. estimated that 15,000 Russian troops had been killed in the war, and about 45,000 wounded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the draft in Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine, four Ukrainian regions, currently partly controlled by Moscow, have started voting in disputed referendums on the issue of formally joining Russia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The referendums are illegal, according to Ukrainian law, and were branded by Zelenskyy as “sham” votes. “The world will react absolutely justly to the sham referenda — they will be unequivocally condemned,” he said on Friday night. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Kremlin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the Russian leadership plans to swiftly incorporate the four regions — Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia — after the results of the vote are officially proclaimed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peskov added that once these territories are incorporated, Ukraine’s attempts to retake them will “definitely” be considered by Moscow as an attack on Russia itself. This could potentially provoke the Kremlin to use tactical nuclear weapons, as Putin warned in his address on Wednesday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Donetsk region’s port city of Mariupol, reduced to rubble during heavy fighting over many weeks earlier this year, residents “are being stopped right on the streets and forced to vote,” according to Petro Andryushchenko, an aide with the exiled Mariupol government. <br /> <br />“It would be possible to call this all a circus, if not for the active involvement of people with rifles,” he said. <br /> <br />Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said in a Facebook post that “the occupiers have closed the cities and people are not allowed to leave, in order to not lose [their] votes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If people don’t open the doors to their apartments — they threaten to knock them down,” Gaidai added in a separate post. <br /> <br />The governor said he is convinced that the tactic of collecting votes through door-to-door visits is also an attempt to detect men who could be conscripted to fight against Kyiv. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mykhailo Podoliak, an adviser to Zelenskyy’s office, called the referendums a “propaganda show” for conscription. <br /> </p>",

        "description": "<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin’s threats to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine are serious, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an interview with the BBC on Saturday, Borrell said the Russian war in Ukraine had reached a “dangerous moment” as the Russian army struggles in the seventh month of its invasion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Certainly it’s a dangerous moment because the Russian army has been pushed into a corner, and Putin’s reaction —  threatening using nuclear arms — it’s very bad,” Borrell said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Russian military has faced serious setbacks in recent weeks as Ukrainian forces mounted a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region. The U.K. Ministry of Defense said on Saturday that Russian commanders have become “increasingly concerned” about difficulties on the battlefield. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moscow has called for the mobilization of 300,000 reservists and Putin raised the specter of using nuclear weapons during an address on state TV on Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“To defend Russia and our people, we doubtlessly will use all weapons resources at our disposal,” Putin said. “This is not a bluff.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When people say it is not a bluff, you have to take them seriously,” Borrell told the BBC on Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Moscow knows there will be “severe consequences” if nuclear weapons are used in Ukraine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The likelihood of any use of nuclear weapons is still low, but the potential consequences are so big, so therefore we have to take this seriously,” Stoltenberg said on CNN. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia is estimated to have nearly 5,977 nuclear warheads — the most in the world after the U.S. — according to the Federation of American Scientists.</p>",

Jack Suwisnki hit his 17th homer of the year, while both Cal Mitchell and Kevin Newman had RBI doubles to make it a 4-2 game in Pittsburgh’s favor after three innings.</p>\n\n\n<p>Captain Jack! pic.twitter.com/K96LXxjcdv</p>— Pittsburgh Pirates (@Pirates) September 23, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>That lead would hold until the sixth, when Wil Crowe blew another one for the Buccos by walking home two runs. He would give up a total of three runs in just one third of an inning, walking three batters total and also giving up a hit. Crowe was good for a big chunk of the year out of the bullpen, but he seems pretty cooked at this point in the season.</p>\n<p>With the Bucs now down a run, Reynold came to the rescue, smacking his 25th homer of the year to tie the game back up. B-Rey’s been pretty hot of late, and it’s been fun to watch. He finished the night 2-for-4 with two runs scored and two RBIs.</p>\n\n\n<p>BRYAN REYNOLDS IS THAT GUY!!! pic.twitter.com/QSrH9SRTSd</p>— Pittsburgh Pirates (@Pirates) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The tie would last only an inning, however, as the Cubbies snagged a run off of Yohan Ramirez in the eighth to take the lead, and though the Pirates would threaten in the ninth, getting two runners on, Cal Mitchell would strike out to end the game, handing Ramirez the loss. </p>\n<p>The Bucs have two more games against Chicago this weekend, but with the end of the season careening towards more and more losses, does anyone have faith they’ll snag one?</p>",

        "description": "Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Dean Kremer was great, the O’s are for sale (sort of), and Mancini is enjoying his Baltimore visit.</p> <p>Good morning, Birdland!</p>\n<p>They’re going to toy with my emotions, aren’t they? The Orioles won again last night, a 6-0 victory over the Houston Astros. It’s their third straight win, and thanks to another loss by the Seattle Mariners, the O’s are now just three games back of the final AL Wild Card spot.</p>\n<p>A tall task remains, and since the Mariners already took the season series from the Orioles it actually needs to be treated more like a four-game gap. With only 12 games remaining on the schedule the odds are long. But it’s possible.</p>\n<p>The last three days do have implications beyond the 2022 playoffs. The Orioles are now 11-10 in September, inching them closer to a fourth consecutive winning month. They are also back in the black for run differential, outscoring opponents by four runs on the season. And how about these pitchers?</p>\n<p>Jordan Lyles, Kyle Bradish, and Dean Kremer have combined to throw 26.2 innings over the last three games. It’s a remarkable run that would be tough for any team to accomplish, let alone one with lack of depth that the Orioles starting staff possesses. </p>\n<p>The front office will need to address the starting rotation in one way or another after the season. John Means won’t be back until midseason, and immediate success for rookie Grayson Rodriguez cannot be expected. But even if they go out and sign a veteran like Carlos Rodon, there will be significant carry over from this year’s unit. </p>\n<p>That brings about questions on what that looks like in practice. Lyles has an $11 million option. Do they pick it up? Kremer and Bradish have been great in the second half. Is it for real? Tyler Wells was quite good before the injury. Does he fit better in the rotation or the bullpen long term? DL Hall is still a starter long term, right?</p>\n<p>The point is that there is a lot to figure out. Performance like those seen this week make those decisions even harder. But that is a good problem to have, one that the Orioles haven’t had in quite some time.</p>\n<p>For now, all attention will be on the next game. Mike Baumann is on the mound tonight with a fully rested bullpen behind him as the O’s look to earn the series win against the visiting Astros.</p>\n<p>Links</p>\n<p>Latest On Orioles’ Ownership Situation | MLB Trade Rumors<br />The update here seems to be that there isn’t actually an update. The franchise is semi-for sale, and has been for months, but nothing is imminent. It remains to be seen if this situation has any impact on the Orioles’ plans for the offseason, when GM Mike Elias has said he expects the team to “liftoff.”</p>\n<p>Three more reflections as Orioles play out their last 12 games | Roch Kubatko<br />What the Orioles do with Jorge Mateo this winter will be worth watching. He has been great, and there is no guarantee that whomever would replace him could do the same. But the team has a load of intriguing young infielders on the way.</p>\n<p>In return to Baltimore, Trey Mancini, fiancee Sara Perlman celebrate the past while embracing the future: ‘He’s so happy where he is’ | The Baltimore Sun<br />I hope that as soon as this series with the Astros wraps up that Trey Mancini can turn things around at the plate. It’s been a rough month-and-a-half for him in Houston, owning an 85 OPS+. </p>\n<p>Orioles birthdays</p>\n<p>Is it your birthday? Happy birthday!</p>\n\nTravis Ishikawa turns 39 today. The first baseman was an Oriole for just six games in 2013.\nJesse Garcia celebrates his 49th birthday. A utility man in the league for seven seasons, Garcia began his career with two years in Baltimore from 1999-2000.\nKevin Millar is 51. The current host of Intentional Talk on MLB Network spent three seasons with the dark ages O’s from 2006 through 2008, posting a 2.3 bWAR in that time.\nRafael Palmeiro is 58 today. His time with Baltimore was split up into two stints, first from 1994 through 1998 and then again from 2004 through 2005. Palmeiro is one of just seven players in MLB history with at least 500 home runs and 3,000 hits, but his ties to steroids will keep him out of the Hall of Fame for the foreseeable future.\nThe late Curt Motton (b. 1940, d. 2010) was born on this day. Motton spent parts of seven seasons with the O’s, split between 1967-71 and then ‘73-74. \n\n<p>This day in O’s history</p>\n<p>1955 - The Orioles deliver the first 100-loss season to the nearby Washington Senators, taking both halves of a doubleheader, 1-0 and 8-5.</p>\n<p>1971 - A pair of Orioles hurlers nab their 20th wins of the season, first Mike Cuellar and then Pat Dobson in victories over Cleveland to clinch the division title.</p>\n<p>1997 - The Orioles clinch the AL East title, becoming the sixth major league team to hold first place for every single day of the regular season.</p>",

Ever since Roe v Wade was overturned earlier this year, however, getting fertility treatments in the US has become exponentially more stressful; the end of Roe triggered a spate of new personhood bills in Republican states which define a fertilized egg or embryo as a legal human entity. If you know anything about in vitro fertilization (IVF), which I’m not sure any of the men drafting these personhood bills do, you’ll immediately know that makes IVF hugely complex. Numerous embryos are usually created during the IVF process as not all will be genetically viable. Unviable embryos, along with embryos that aren’t donated or frozen for later use, will be disposed. If these collections of cells are considered people then, according to the personhood laws, you’ve committed a crime by disposing of them.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>With just 11 games remaining, things are still up for grabs in the National League’s playoff picture. </p> <p>The gap in the NL East race widened again Friday night as the Atlanta Braves lost to the Philadelphia Phillies while the New York Mets won in Oakland. Friday’s results brought a shakeup in the Wild Card standings. Here is how everything looks heading into play Saturday. </p>\nThe Division Race\n<p>The Braves fell behind early and were again unable to generate any offense in a 9-1 loss to the Phillies. Atlanta has now lost three straight games and are 2.5 games behind the Mets in the NL East standings. New York reduced its magic number to clinch the division to just nine with a 9-2 win in Oakland. </p>\n<p>The Braves will send Kyle Wright to the mound Saturday in hopes of avoiding their first four-game losing streak of the season. Philadelphia will counter with left-hander Bailey Falter. The Mets will continue their series in Oakland with Jacob deGrom matching up against rookie Ken Waldichuk. </p>\n<p>The Cardinals beat the Dodgers 11-0 Friday night and reduced their magic number to clinch the NL Central to four. </p>\nThe Wild Card\n<p>Despite their recent struggles, the Braves still have a 10 game advantage over the Phillies in the Wild Card standings. Friday’s win however moved the Phillies past the Padres and into the second Wild Card spot. The Padres dropped their second straight game Friday night losing to the Rockies 4-3. </p>\n<p>Philadelphia now has a half game lead over San Diego. The Padres are two games up on the Brewers, who defeated the Reds 5-3 Friday night, for the final Wild Card spot. Milwaukee has now won three straight games. </p>\nPlayoff Picture\n<p>So things now look a little different for the National League’s postseason picture. If the playoffs started today, the Dodgers and Mets would still receive first round byes. </p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>The Cardinals would now matchup against the Padres while Atlanta would host the Phillies in the best-of-three Wild Card round which would get under way on October 7. The winner of the Cardinals/Padres series would advance to take on the Mets while the Braves/Phillies winner would head to Los Angeles to face the Dodgers in a best-of-five series. </p>",

The hypno-hen soon went viral, and now the late broadcaster's family have set up a website in his honour.<br /><br /> You can find other On the Air clips on YouTube, but the family site conveniently gathers them on one page. There's also a DVD release of all three series of the show. Fans of Aardman's Creature Comforts, Mid-Morning Matters with Alan Partridge and Peter Serafinowicz's impressions of the late Terry Wogan will love it.",

Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>After a blowout loss to St. Louis in the series opener on Friday night, the Dodgers suffered their 47th loss of the season, so we can officially end any thoughts of Los Angeles matching the major league record for wins in a season.</p>\n<p>The 1906 Chicago Cubs and 2001 Mariners can rest easy, knowing their 116 victories remain as the high-water mark for MLB.</p>\n<p>But though their play on Friday didn’t show it, the Dodgers are well within range to set a few franchise records.</p>\nDodgers wins record\n<p>Now at 104-47, the Dodgers could set a franchise wins record by Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The team high is 106 wins, accomplished by both the 2019 and 2021 teams. This year’s team needs only a 3-8 finish to break that record.</p>\n<p>In terms of winning percentage, the team record was set by the 1899 Brooklyn Superbas at 101-47 (.6824), then nearly matched by the 1953 Brooklyn Dodgers (105-49, .6818). The 2020 team had a better record than both at 43-17 (.717) but that was over a 60-game campaign.</p>\n<p>Looking at this year’s Dodgers, they already beat the 1899 Superbas through the 148 games that Brooklyn played, starting 103-45. They would need to win two of their next three games to beat the 1953 team on their schedule terms. But to keep up a winning percentage over this full season that would beat those two Brooklyn teams, the Dodgers need 111 wins this year, which requires a 7-4 finish.</p>\nNational League history\n<p>If the Dodgers win five of their final nine games, they’d be the first National League team in over a century to win more than 108 games.</p>\n<p>These are the highest win totals by a National League team:</p>\n\n1906 Cubs: 116-36\n1909 Pirates: 110-42\n1975 Reds: 108-54\n1986 Mets: 108-54\n\n<p>At the moment, only 11 teams in National League history have won 106 games in a season. The Dodgers are two wins away from having three of the 12 teams to do so, all in their last three full seasons.</p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "Who's ready for a breather? A flurry of hardware and software releases following Apple's \"Far Out\" event earlier this month is finally on a bit of a pause, with the Apple Watch Ultra and second-generation AirPods Pro now making their way into customers' hands while we have a couple of weeks before the iPhone 14 Plus launches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis week saw the two major hardware releases, but also an important iOS update addressing some bugs with the latest iPhone models and iOS 16 in general, while the more significant iOS 16.1 update continues through beta testing. Be sure to read on below for details on these stories and more as we continue to explore everything new in Apple's latest releases.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Releases iOS 16.0.2 With Bug Fixes for iPhone 14 Pro and More\r<br />\nApple has released iOS 16.0.2 with several bug fixes. Notably, the update addresses an issue with the rear camera shaking and vibrating uncontrollably on the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe software update also addresses an issue with excessive copy and paste permission prompts on all iPhones running iOS 16, an issue where touch input was unresponsive on some iPhone X, iPhone XR, and iPhone 11 displays following hardware service, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, Apple continues to test iOS 16.1, which will include support for Live Activities in third-party apps, a new Clean Energy Charging feature in the United States, availability of Apple Fitness+ without an Apple Watch, support for Matter accessories in the Home app, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHands-On With the New AirPods Pro 2\r<br />\nApple's second-generation AirPods Pro have begun arriving to customers, and we've had a chance to go hands-on with the upgraded earbuds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe've also rounded up both written and video reviews of the new AirPods Pro from select media and YouTube channels that had early access for more thorough looks. The reviews tested out sound quality, active noise cancellation, battery life, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Watch Ultra Unboxing and Hands-On\r<br />\nLike the new AirPods Pro, the all-new Apple Watch Ultra is now officially available as the first pre-orders have started arriving.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe've gone hands-on for an early unboxing and initial impressions, and we've rounded up both written and video reviews of the Apple Watch Ultra, which is bigger and better than any other Apple Watch model but isn't considered to be a \"Garmin killer\" yet due to a lack of certain features, such as offline maps and recovery metrics for workouts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEverything New for iPhone in iOS 16.1 Beta 2\r<br />\nApple this week seeded the second beta of iOS 16.1 to developers and public beta testers. As usual, the latest beta contains a handful of new features, changes, and improvements for the iPhone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe've rounded up everything new in iOS 16.1 beta 2, including a design tweak to the battery percentage icon in the status bar and more, so be sure to check out the list if you install the beta on your iPhone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYouTuber Actually Tests iPhone 14's Crash Detection Feature\r<br />\nThe new car crash detection feature on all iPhone 14 models is hard to test given that reviewers don't want to risk physical injuries, but one YouTuber has managed to test the feature in a driverless car.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that the video does not serve as a scientific test of the feature and is in a controlled environment, so it should be considered purely entertainment, but at least we finally have a closer look at the feature out in the wild.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe MacRumors Show: Sara Dietschy Talks iPhone 14 Features\r<br />\nYouTuber and content creator Sara Dietschy joined us this week on The MacRumors Show podcast to talk through our experiences of all of the iPhone 14 and 14 Pro lineup's new features and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\r<br />\nListen to The MacRumors Show via apps like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Castro, Google Podcasts, or subscribe by copying our RSS feed directly into your podcast player. You can also watch a video version of the podcast on our YouTube channel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMacRumors Newsletter\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have top stories like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, subscribe to our newsletter!Tag: Top Stories<br />This article, \"Top Stories: iOS 16.0.2 Bug Fixes, Apple Watch Ultra and AirPods Pro 2 Launch, and More\" first appeared on MacRumors.com<br /><br />Discuss this article in our forums<br /><br />",

        "description": "Photo by Tim Clayton/Corbis via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>When I bought these tickets, history wasn’t even on my mind. Now, it’s all I can think about.</p> <p>Six years ago in August, I decided that I wanted to get one more Yankee game in that summer before heading back to college for the start of my junior year. Looking at my calendar, I saw that there was only one day where I was free that the team was in the Bronx: August 12th. I bought the tickets, eager to see the Yankees take on the Tampa Bay Rays, and intrigued by the giveaway: a replica of the 1996 championship trophy, celebrating the team that sparked a dynasty just months after I was born.</p>\n<p>Three days later, the Yankees made a stunning announcement — longtime third baseman Alex Rodriguez would be playing his final game as a member of the New York Yankees on August 12th. Without meaning to, I stumbled into the chance to see history, and while I ended up missing Aaron Judge’s major league debut by a day, I will never forget watching one of the greatest players of my childhood walk off the field for the last time.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, after attending a brutal Yankees loss in the middle of their horrific August, I decided that I wanted to go to at least one more game. Looking at the calendar, there was just one day in September that this teacher had free: Saturday, September 24th, against the Boston Red Sox.</p>\n<p>I had no way of knowing. At the time, Aaron Judge had 46 home runs, and nobody else in the lineup showed even a hint of life at the plate. 60 seemed in reach, but on like October 5th or 6th; it was going to happen in Texas, most likely, in the four-game set against the Rangers to end the season.</p>\n<p>And then Aaron Judge hit nine home runs in 14 games — in the metaphorical blink of an eye, 46 became 55. A pair of two-homer games later, plus a comeback-sparking bomb on Tuesday, and suddenly, 60 wasn’t just a dream, it was real. And now, again, I stumble into the chance to see history.</p>\n<p>History is my life. During the mornings, I teach history, and in the afternoons, Latin, a language consigned to history. I spend my days pondering things I’ve never seen, places I’ve never visited, people I’ve never met (and will never have the chance of meeting). Here at Pinstripe Alley, I’ve written my fair share of history pieces, investigating among other things New York’s pre-baseball rivalry with Boston, the evolution of the bat and ball games that evolved into the sport we know and love, and the backdoor dealings that led to the league organization we tolerate. History is one of the pillars that makes up “John Griffin,” along with baseball, Villanova basketball, and theatre.</p>\n<p>And yet, faced with the prospect of seeing history this afternoon, I can’t help but fumble over my words trying to put my thoughts into prose. Like all of you, I’ve heard about the Yankees legends my entire life, listened to tales about Ron Guidry’s 18-strikeout masterpiece, Babe Ruth’s called shot, Lou Gehrig’s incredible streak, and of course, Roger Maris’ and Mickey Mantle’s chase for 61. Of course, I have counted myself lucky that I had a chance to see many all-time greats that have donned the pinstripes, from Hall of Famers who cameo’d in the Bronx at the ends of their careers like Ichiro Suzuki to the greatest relief pitcher to ever walk the Earth, Mariano Rivera, and I’ve been fortunate enough to see some epic games in person. But this ... this is different. This time, it’s personal.</p>\n<p>The 2013 draft in which the Yankees took Aaron Judge was the first MLB Draft that I really paid attention to. Up until that point, minor leaguers really didn’t become “real” to me until they were in Triple-A and were on the verge of being called up. While I had gone to some minor league games, they seemed so far from the majors, too far to really think about. And yet, faced with the knowledge that the Yankees had three first-round picks and were, in truth, a terrible team for the first time in my lifetime, I followed the draft, booting up the school computers after exams to see the latest updates. And their second first-round pick, an outfielder built like Giancarlo Stanton, the Marlins outfielder who hit 37 home runs the year prior, looked exciting. And so, Judge became the first player I truly followed from the moment the Yankees drafted him until he became a major league star.</p>\n<p>And, if Roger Maris and Babe Ruth are smiling down upon us today, the first player I followed from the time he was drafted until the time he made history.</p>",

It would be more accurate to peg Hot Chip, now on their eighth album, as a perpetual motion machine, rarely faltering – a particularly fine example of British engineering. It’s a surprise, then, when this theoretically urbane electronic outfit come to an abrupt halt because their beast of a drummer has burst the skin on his kick drum. And yet here is Hot Chip percussionist Leo Taylor, greeting the news that he’s been playing too hard by leaping up and doing some double devil’s horns to howls of approval.</p><p>Hot Chip have maintained a metronomic pulse at the heart of British song-making for more than 20 years, pairing Alexis Taylor’s sweet vocals with a kaleidoscopic range of percolating sounds. Over and Over was their first hit, in 2006. It remains not just a reworked live staple, faster and harder than the original, but something of a tenet for the band to live by. Hot Chip called their 2010 album One Life Stand, in part to explore the beauty of committed relationships as distinct from fraught one-night stands: another title-as-creed. They’ve never split up, directing any non-Chip energies into solo albums and record labels such as Greco-Roman, co-frontman Joe Goddard’s side gig. Both Taylor and Goddard have recently put out standalone works: Taylor’s touching lockdown meditation, Silence, in 2021, and Goddard’s disco- and house- fuelled outing with Amy Douglas, Hard Feelings, earlier this year.</p> Continue reading...",

The Beths, from Auckland, are the latest musical export to follow in the footsteps of the Clean, the Chills, the Verlaines et al, with a sound succinctly, and accurately, described by singer Elizabeth Stokes as “sweetly sung melodies and super-depressing lyrics”. That love of contradiction is also apparent in the video accompanying recent single Knees Deep (from their newly released third album, the excellent Expert in a Dying Field), a song about Stokes’s cowardice that features the four-piece band (completed by guitarist Jonathan Pearce, bassist Benjamin Sinclair and drummer Tristan Deck) bungee jumping.</p><p>Currently on tour in Australia and their homeland in support of the new album, they’re relishing the contrast with the more muted, pandemic-affected response to its predecessor, 2020’s Jump Rope Gazers. Stokes recently told Our Culture magazine that back then, “it was kind of weird putting a song out and then sitting at home, twiddling your thumbs being like, I wonder if anybody likes it”. This time around, “it’s been really nice seeing a song come out and then playing it the next day and there’s people who already know the words”.</p><p>Expert in a Dying Field is out now on Carpark.

        "description": "<p>Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) criticized a near-total abortion ban that a judge upheld in her state, saying Saturday that it removes the “basic rights” of women. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sinema tweeted that Arizona women should not be forced to travel outside the state to receive health care services and doctors should not face criminal penalties for taking care of women in need. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A woman’s health care decisions should be between her, her family, and her doctor,” she said. “Today’s decision removes basic rights Arizona women have relied upon for over a century and endangers their health, safety, and well-being.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sinema’s comments come after an Arizona judge ruled Friday that the state can enforce a ban that has been blocked for nearly 50 years, since the Supreme Court’s ruling in Roe v. Wade protected abortion access nationwide. The ban was enacted in the 1800s before Arizona became a state, but its enforcement was halted after the Roe ruling in 1973. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>State Attorney General Mark Brnovich (R) had urged the judge to allow the state to enforce the ban. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The judge ruled that the injunction that prevented enforcement of the law was only issued because of Roe v. Wade, so it must be lifted completely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ban will prevent the procedure in all cases except for when the pregnant person's life is at risk. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than a dozen states either had trigger bans go into effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe in June or passed legislation banning it since then. Many bans do not include exceptions for rape or incest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sinema said she will continue to work to advance “commonsense proposals” to ensure women in Arizona and across the country can access the health care they need and make their own decisions about their futures. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arizona’s other senator, Mark Kelly (D), also criticized the ruling, saying that overturning Roe set women’s rights back \"decades.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I won’t stop until we restore abortion rights so my granddaughter can have the same freedoms my grandmother did,” he said.</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3659420-putins-final-goal-in-ukraine-has-demonstrably-shifted-as-has-his-escalation-calculus/",
        "description": "<p>Vladimir Putin’s Sept. 21 speech — alongside Russian mobilization and sham referenda in Ukraine’s occupied east and south — demonstrates that the Russian leader’s immediate war aims have shifted. As always, Putin seeks to let the context shift, grab what he can, and await a better set of circumstances. Putin’s goal is now a stalled conflict, not a frozen one. The West must deny him this victory by assisting Ukraine in another counteroffensive before winter, while preparing a series of responses to Putin’s threat of nuclear escalation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two weeks ago, the Ukrainian military, with only a limited force — around a division’s worth of soldiers — employed tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, and anti-aircraft systems to push deeply into Russian-held territory. By manipulating Russian expectations and trumpeting a counteroffensive in Kherson Oblast, Ukraine prompted Russia to leave only light forces covering its positions between Izyum and Kupyansk. Ukrainian units ripped through the Russian lines, captured Russia’s primary logistics artery running from Belgorod to Izyum, and thereby compelled a Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine’s counteroffensive changed the course of the war in three ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, by eliminating Russia’s Belgorod-Izyum supply route, it undermined any favorable operational geometry in the Donbas. Russian advances stemmed from favorable geometry: The Severodonetsk salient was at the end of a long, vulnerable neck that the Russians could slowly choke. The Slovyansk pocket is far wider and lies behind a robust defensive line between Siversk and Bakhmut. Russia had abandoned immediate advances from Izyum, but as long as it maintained that position, it could have once again reduced a Ukrainian pocket. Now that Russia has withdrawn from Kharkiv Oblast, the Donbas is far more secure: Absent a massive influx of trained manpower, a renewed Donbas offensive is highly unlikely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, the counteroffensive demonstrated that Ukraine could retake territory using Western-supplied armor. Throughout summer, analysts and national governments alike worried that Ukraine had left a counteroffensive in the south too late and that Russian redeployments had locked in the so-called war of attrition indefinitely. The counteroffensive has given Kyiv valuable credibility heading into winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, and most crucial, Ukraine’s counteroffensive demonstrated that, absent drastic action, the Russian military could not sustain its “Special Military Operation” (SMO). It was not simply an issue of reserves and materiel stocks, although Russia did lack the military equipment to sustain its grinding offensive pace and respond to Ukrainian counterstrokes. More fundamentally, the Russian command structure was entirely inadequate vis-a-vis the task at hand. The shadowy Russian mercenary/paramilitary organization, the Wagner Group, and its private military companies (PMC’s) reported, through owner Yevgeny Prigozhin, to Putin directly; Russian Rosgvardia likely had an independent command structure; the L/DNR militsyia had their own warlords who nominally reported to Russian commanders, and the Russian regular military, which began the war without a clear command structure, may still lack an overall command-staff apparatus to fight the war from the field, rather than through Moscow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vladimir Putin had to respond to survive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia has taken three clear steps, expressed through its post-Sept. 10 actions, Putin’s Sept. 21 speech, and its Sept. 23 sham annexations. In general, Russian choices indicate a revision of Russia’s immediate war aims, and an intensification of escalatory threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin’s Sept. 21 speech indicates strategic changes that were almost certainly agreed to during his discussion with China’s Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. Initially, Putin’s aims were maximalist: His “SMO” was meant to demilitarize and “denazify” Ukraine, per his Feb. 24 war speech. Russia’s goals were identical when Putin expressed them on May 9, although he was unwilling to commit to a mobilization that would stress the Russian state. Now, however, the “denazification” and demilitarization rhetoric is gone: “Novorossiya,” the Russian imperial term for Ukraine’s non-Crimean south, has returned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin’s Sept. 21 speech was meant to square the political-ideological circle. He explained, with limited logical success, why the Donbas-focused “special military operation” — which also involved a strike towards Kyiv — now required the annexation of Ukraine’s south. The south, nevertheless, is the war’s strategic prize. By controlling Ukraine’s coastline, Putin can secure a land bridge to Crimea, thereby remedying a previously untenable long-term strategic position, and force Ukraine to route exports at scale through Russia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This does not indicate Putin seeks an “off-ramp.” In the long-term, Russia’s goals likely remain unchanged. Putin likely hopes to stall the conflict, prevent a Ukrainian counterstroke, and — in time — let the context shift, awaiting a collapse in Western cohesion or perhaps even a Chinese attack on Taiwan. In the short-term, however, Russia will look to hold its gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobilization and annexation are efforts, in the immediate future, to increase Russian combat power and deterrence credibility. The Russian military lacks the men and materiel to produce trained, equipped units, considering its officer casualties and the damage sanctions have done to Russia’s military-industrial base. Nor is the Russian reserve system a reserve in the Western or Soviet sense. The overwhelming majority of Russian reservists have not trained since their conscript terms ended, while only a handful, perhaps just several thousand, have drilled consistently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Russia’s mobilization decree eliminates the legal procedures Russian soldiers can use to avoid combat. This will provide a manpower boost. And Russia’s new soldiers will provide some manpower, especially if used on the defensive to hold fixed positions against an attacking Ukrainian force.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, Putin is playing for time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has opened a window on the top story: The Russian state was wholly unprepared for mobilization; the West has yet to crack, and China has not acted decisively to split Western attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of stress, the Russian state will react, and the security services are organized effectively enough internally to prevent large-scale dissent — unless the army stages a putsch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But from now until early spring 2023, Russia’s growing pains and combat weaknesses will create clear risks. A successful Ukrainian offensive, one that jeopardizes Russia’s position in the south and squeezes Crimea — most likely by a drive through Zaporizhzhia Oblast towards Melitopol, Russia’s most obvious supply artery at this point — could cause a large enough morale shock to collapse the Russian military. At minimum, it would isolate between 70,000 and 200,000 Russians, depending on the Kremlin’s reserve deployments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence the nuclear threats the Kremlin makes today must be taken seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin’s risk calculation is that, given Russia’s military position, holding the south will be difficult if not impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet nuclear use, even in a demonstrative manner, would violate the limited war’s boundaries and enable far greater NATO intervention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine’s response, of course, will be gradual. It will slowly but surely wrap its coils around the enemy, target the Russian bridgehead on the Dnipro River’s north bank, an area from which Russia may very well withdraw, and will continue its interdiction campaign, a campaign even more effective with new Russian soldiers that must be armed and fed at ever-growing rates. Much as Ukraine struck Crimea without a major Russian reaction, Ukraine can do the same after annexation in the south and east.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, Ukraine must stage a counteroffensive at some point, and again, likely before the winter — and if not then, before the early spring, once the Russian state and military have several months to adapt to the new situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turn, Russia is likely to multiply its strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure. The Enerhodar Reactor could be sabotaged; the Kakhovka Dam or the Dnipro’s other dams could be hit with long-range missiles, and other power stations and relevant civilian infrastructure could be destroyed. This will not break Ukrainian will, nor would it significantly reduce combat capacity. But it might kill tens of thousands more Ukrainians and restrict Ukraine’s operational freedom of movement along the Dnipro, perhaps giving Russia a local advantage in parts of the south.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>American and Western policy must account for this new set of circumstances. Four steps are necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, NATO should stage a major combined-arms exercise in Poland and Romania, demonstrating its ability to generate forces rapidly and at scale. This would indicate to Putin that, if the nuclear threshold is crossed, the U.S. could stage a large enough conventional response to jeopardize Russian combat capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, the U.S. and its allies should step up their cyber and electronic pressure on Russia. Ukraine has no ability to respond to Russian strikes on critical infrastructure in relative kind — indeed, providing Ukraine with this capability may be undesirable for the West; yet, the U.S. can increase its jamming and spoofing efforts against Russian targeting systems, particularly if it increases aerial presence in the Black Sea, which will open up greater avenues of pressure for Ukraine’s long-range fires. Similarly, cyber and electronic pressure can disrupt Russian communications between field headquarters and combat units, complicate the mobilization process, and undermine the Kremlin’s picture of the war. Inducing friction throughout Russian command structures will erode Russian capacity. The sooner Ukraine mounts its next major offensive, the sooner this war is terminated on favorable terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />Third, the U.S. must accelerate its transfer of air defenses to Ukraine. Russia must be denied the ability to degrade Ukrainian critical infrastructure as an escalatory outlet. Only air defenses can even the balance in this respect, ranging from Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Systems (NASAMS) to perhaps spare PATRIOT batteries and remaining Soviet-era air-defense equipment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fourth, and most important, the U.S. must credibly demonstrate its counterforce nuclear capacity. This requires the most robust and visible nuclear deployments the U.S. and NATO have made since the Cold War, including heavy bombers equipped with variable-yield weapons, missile deployments, and intense submarine coverage throughout Russian naval bastions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All wars must end. The U.S. cannot allow this one to end on Putin’s terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not that nuclear threats are a bluff, or that Russia is a paper tiger. The U.S. must do the hard work of ensuring escalation dominance and managing a nuclear crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seth Cropsey is founder and president of Yorktown Institute.

        "description": "<p>Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore said on Friday that he believes there will be a “massive” turnout of women during the 2022 midterm elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think that there’s going to be such a massive turnout of women,” Moore said on HBO’s “Real Time with Bill Maher.” The \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" director said that women are energized to vote following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark case that determined the right to abortion was constitutional. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I want to thank the Supreme Court for reminding women that they are in fact second-class citizens and taking their rights away like this,” he said sarcastically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moore also referenced a ballot measure that was voted down in Kansas that would have allowed the state legislature to ban abortion, the first major post-Roe referendum on the Supreme Court's decision. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moore said that an overwhelming number newly registered voters (70 percent) in Kansas are women. A data analysis from The New York Times showed that 70 percent of newly registered voters are women. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also said Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are bringing in higher percentages of new female voters than male voters by double digits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maher agreed with Moore that there is “very high enthusiasm” for the upcoming elections, saying: “For the first time I can remember, the midterms are sexy.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You and I are two well-known pessimists, I think, and I have never felt this optimistic,” Moore responded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filmmaker, who predicted former President Trump’s unexpected presidential victory on Maher’s show in 2016, said that he foresees this year’s elections as turning out to be the “opposite” of six years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think the opposite’s going to happen this time,” said Moore. “I think there’s going to be such a landslide against the traitors, especially the 147 Republicans who just hours after the insurrection voted to not certify the elected president of the United States, Joe Biden.”</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/3658778-why-black-leaders-stand-against-invest-to-protect-act/",
        "description": "<p>Two years ago, people took to the streets calling for justice in light of the murder of George Floyd at the hands of the police. And yet, despite the massive protests and large-scale media attention that led to shows of solidarity from national and local political leaders, influencers, and even major corporations, Black people continue to struggle against the constant threat of police violence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last month alone, our communities lost Jason Owens, who was killed while serving as a pallbearer at his father’s funeral; Jayland Walker, who was shot four dozen times during a traffic stop and Donovan Lewis, who was killed while lying in bed. And we know that unless the Biden administration changes course, we will lose many more lives to policing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why more than 65 national organizations serving Black communities have urged the House and Congressional Black Caucus to take a stand against the Invest to Protect Act, the COPS on the Beat Program Reauthorization and Parity Act, as well as any other proposal that invests in policing. The Black-led organizations have joined an open letter opposing these bills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Invest to Protect Act was passed by the House as part of a policing package this week, it still needs the Senate’s approval. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make no mistake — while the intent of these bills may be to maintain law and order in local communities, these measures in reality fund and encourage militarized policing and lead to harassment, incarceration and even death of Black people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that this proposed legislation comes on the heels of President Biden’s Safer America Act shows an appalling disregard of what Black communities actually need and want — to defund police and policing, while investing in community resources like quality education, mental health and health care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police budgets are already bloated, and despite their ample resources, all evidence points to the fact that policing does not decrease crime. In fact, state and local police departments have received more than $14 billion in Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) funding in the past 25 years — not including the $100 million received merely a month ago through the Safer Communities Act, which was intended to be used for COVID-19 relief and recovery. Yet, time and time again, we have seen how  local police departments are unable to prevent harm or increase the overall safety of a city, often escalating violent situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s how traffic stops, one of the most common interactions with the police, become deadly encounters. Over 400 unarmed people have been killed by police in traffic stops over the past five years and that number likely only continues to climb. Many of the drivers and passengers struck down and killed by police were Black. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it’s been said that no one is above the law, police officers usually are. Most police officers are almost never convicted for their actions, even when they face criminal charges. The “use of force standard” has given police the liberty to arrest, beat and kill if they claim to have feared for their lives. Meanwhile, qualified immunity allows police officers to walk if their exact misconduct has never been ruled unlawful in another case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the reality of policing. It is a model that is inherently dangerous for Black, brown, LGBTQ+ and poor people, lacking in all accountability to communities that police are said to be sworn to protect. This is not a system that needs more funding, but rather needs serious reimagining. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all want to be safe in our neighborhoods and schools and communities. But in order to get there, we need to rethink what public safety looks like. Our people should be able to live in a world that is free and safe from the violence and racism of policing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judith Browne Dianis is executive director of Advancement Project. </p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3659410-denver-riggleman-white-house-switchboard-connected-to-rioters-phone-on-day-of-jan-6/",
        "description": "<p>Former Rep. Denver Riggleman (R-Va.), who staffed the Jan. 6 Committee until April, said on Friday that the White House switchboard connected with the phone of a rioter at the U.S. Capitol during the insurrection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You get a real ‘a-ha’ moment when you see that the White House switchboard had connected to a rioter's phone while it's happening,” said Riggleman, former senior technical adviser for the committee, according to a clip from CBS’s upcoming episode of \"60 Minutes.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked by host Bill Whitaker to confirm that someone in the White House was calling an insurrectionist during the riot, Riggleman said: “On January sixth, absolutely.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riggleman, author of upcoming book “The Breach,” said that the call raised a red flag from his perspective as a former military intelligence officer working in counterterrorism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I only know one end of that call. I don't know the White House end, which I believe is more important,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“But the thing is, the American people need to know that there are link connections that need to be explored more.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whitaker inquired whether there is a “simple, innocent explanation” for the call, to which Riggleman responded: “Was it an accidental call?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When the White House just happened to call numbers, that somebody misdialed a rioter that day, on January sixth? Probably not,” he continued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riggleman was ousted from his congressional seat in 2020 after outrage from members of his party that he officiated a same-sex wedding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former representative elaborated on his role as an adviser to the House select committee investigating the attack on the Capitol, where he led a digital investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We were able to do things, I think, in a way that had never been done before with millions of lines of data. And to actually create a graph that shows how these groups actually intermingled,” Riggleman told “60 Minutes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Communications have been highly scrutinized following the Capitol riot, including text messages from the phones of top Trump administration officials.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In August, a watchdog group reported that the Department of Defense failed to retain texts from a number of its top officials on Jan. 6. In addition, numerous officials from the Department of Homeland Security also had their messages erased during the transition, including former acting Secretary Chad Wolf and Ken Cuccinelli. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full episode of \"60 Minutes\" is set to air Sunday. </p>",

        "description": "Patrick Oehler/Poughkeepsie Journal, Poughkeepsie Journal via Imagn Content Services, LLC\n    \n\n  <p>The Houston Astros had 316 players appear in a game somewhere from their system in 2022. </p> The current offseason will see Crawfish Boxes review each of the 316 players to appear at some level of the Astros system in 2022. \n<p>Although the regular season doesn’t end for another two weeks, I was set on starting early because even profiling two players per day, I would still not have them all done by the start of spring training. I compromised by starting as late as I could and still guarantee finishing, and by only profiling players who appeared only below the Double-A level through October 1. Today is the 13th day of this project. There will be 145 more. </p>\nEurys Martich\n<p>Eurys Martich is a six-foot-three, 206 lb. right-handed pitcher from San Cristobal, DR. Born on August 20, 2002, Martich signed his first professional contract with Houston on July 2, 2019. </p>\n<p>Although Martich has technically been a part of the Astros organization for three-plus years now, he wasn’t assigned to an affiliate until nearly two years after he signed. He joined the DSL Astros in July, 2021, and put up a 2.734 WHIP in 26 1⁄3 innings. You read that right. Martich did strike out 43 batters over that span, but also surrendered 44 runs (42 earned) on 18 wild pitches, 20 hits, and 52 walks. That’s almost two walks per inning, and Martich was blessed with a 14.35 ERA. </p>\n\n      \n\n\n \n View this post on Instagram\n\n \n   \n\n  \n\n   \n\n   \n<p>A post shared by Euris Valentin Mateo (@eurys_martich)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martich joined the FCL Astros Blue Squad for the 2022 campaign, and fared only slightly better. In 17 2⁄3 frames, he struck out 17 batters but walked 28, allowing 14 runs (nine earned) on 16 hits and eight wild pitches. Despite his WHIP improving slightly to 2.491, his ERA improved by triple, all the way down to 4.58. </p>\n<p>Martich has a very long and uphill climb if he wants to someday reach the major league level. I find it doubtful that he’ll remain with the club into 2023. </p>\nLuis Encarnacion\n<p>Luis Encarnacion is a five-foot-eight, 170 lb. first baseman and catcher from Santo Domingo, DR. Born on September 25, 2022, Encarnacion turns 20-years-old tomorrow. On July 2, 2019, he signed his first official contract with the Houston Astros organization. Like Martich, Encarnacion didn’t appear in a game-setting until the 2021 campaign. Unlike Martich, Encarnacion looked passable right away. </p>\n<p>In his first season as a pro, Encarnacion led the DSL Astros with 56 appearances and with 72 total bases. He slashed .320/.401/.426 with 25 RBI and 15 stolen bases in 18 attempts. Also notable was his lower-than-expected 11.5 percent whiff-rate. Defensively, he racked up a .960 fielding percentage in 210 innings at first base. As a catcher, he threw out two-of-15 baserunners and put up a 1.000 fielding percentage through 56 innings, although he was guilty of five passed balls. Fourteen times he put up multiple hits in a game, including on July 17, when he went three-for-four with three singles and three RBI in the DSL Astros first win of the season, a 15-5 victory over the DSL Twins. </p>\n<p>The 2022 campaign would see Encarnacion start the season with the FCL Astros, a lateral promotion of sorts. In 40 games with the Orange squad, he hit .264/.324/.436 with five homers, 29 RBI, and a very low whiff rate of just 12 percent. </p>\n<p>Defensively this season, the Astros wanted to try Encarnacion in a variety of places. He played 71 innings at first base (1.000), 61 innings at second (.967), 41 innings at third (.923), 21 innings in left field (1.000), and 67 frames behind the plate (1.000). As a catcher he passed zero balls and threw out four-of-19 runners trying to steal. </p>\n<p>Encarnacion’s modularity no doubt makes him an easy decision to retain. I consider it a good bet that he starts next year at the Low-A level with the Fayetteville Woodpeckers. A conservative estimate would see him making an impact on a major league field of play sometime in 2027 or 2028. </p>",

        "description": "<p>But what then?</p> <p>SSS duty geezer Leigh Allan and his son and west coast correspondent, Will, took a pass on maintaining hope for the 1/1,000 chance computer algorithms give the White Sox to win the AAAL Central (maybe we shouldn’t call it that any more, since Cleveland appears to be an actual major league team), did some of the mandatory lamenting about the horrible quality of baseball and spirit the White Sox showed not just in being swept by the Guardians but the entire season — except right after the HOFBP flew off to get his pacemaker jiggered (a small number of players excepted). And then, they looked toward the future.</p>\n<p>It not being polite to harp on the need for the death of you-know-who, they called for the immediate firing of Ken Williams, followed by the sequential firings of the entire front office on down to field level, including the coaches (except Ethan Katz, of course).</p>\n<p>That is what’s known in journalism as a #*%)@$ fantasy.</p>\n<p>On the field, they considered what to do with a team that currently puts as many as five players in the lineup who should only be designated hitters, promote the idea of having Tim Anderson come and finish the season — at second base — and once again suggest maybe it’s not a terrific idea to have your starters throw more pitches per inning than anyone else.</p>\n<p>Looking at what could theoretically be instead of what actually is got so exciting they kept going until Mr. Zoom ended the discussion as abruptly and assuredly as Cleveland ended the White Sox season.</p>\n\n<p>Listen below, on our built-in Megaphone player:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>or follow along with every episode at Apple Podcasts or Spotify, or wherever you consume your podcasts.

HarperCollins Publishers<p>“A Spoonful of Frogs” was written by Casey Lyall and illustrated by Caldecott Honor artist Vera Brosgol. Angela Whited says she’s already read this book at story time at Red Balloon Bookshop in St. Paul, and the book was a hit with listeners of all ages. </p><p>The story is about a witch who is hosting a cooking show called “Bewitching Kitchen,” and today, she’s teaching everyone to make every witch’s favorite recipe: frog soup. Unfortunately, one of the key ingredients simply will not cooperate when she tries to put it in the pot. </p><p>Whited calls the book “comedy gold” that is fun to read any time of year. The witch’s big emotions and the vivid, high-contrast illustrations make this a great read-aloud book.  </p>",

Not that the Tides did any damage against Glasnow specifically; the rehabbing Rays ace pitched 2.2 brilliant innings, striking out six, with a walk as his only blemish.</p>\n\n\n<p>Tyler Glasnow struck out the side in order on 15 pitches in his 1st frame tonight<br /><br />lol just look at these pitches pic.twitter.com/zq5EsOZCeZ</p>— Durham Bulls (@DurhamBulls) September 23, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Once Glasnow left the game, though, the Tides were able to get the offense going. They erased a 3-0 deficit by scoring three runs in the sixth, Connor Norby — who else? — got the rally started with a leadoff double. Norby is off to an 8-for-19 (.421) start in his first week at Triple-A, and has reached base in 15 straight games dating back to his stint at Bowie. Jordan Westburg also singled in the inning, part of a 3-for-5 night that raised his OPS to .893. An error and a passed ball plated two runs before Tyler Nevin tied the game with an RBI single.</p>\n<p>Westburg delivered again with a go-ahead single in the seventh, and Colton Cowser added insurance with a home run in the eighth, his fourth for Norfolk. After a slow start at Triple-A, Cowser certainly seems to be getting acclimated to the level. He has hits in 11 of his last 12 games, batting .327 in that stretch. Joey Ortiz had a pair of hits as well and is now slashing .345/.404/.560. The top of the Tides’ lineup has an embarrassment of riches in prospects.</p>\n<p>On the mound, Chris Vallimont gave a valiant effort (Valli-ant effort?) with 6.2 innings, giving up three early runs but settling down after that. Ryan Watson followed with 1.1 hitless frames, and relief ace Nick Vespi retired the side in order in the ninth for his eighth save. With just five games remaining in the season, Vespi still carries a perfect 0.00 ERA in 25 games for Norfolk, stretching across 27.1 innings.</p>\n<p>Box score</p>\nSaturday’s scheduled game:\n<p>Norfolk: at Durham, 6:35 PM.

        "link": "https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/09/what-i-learned-in-my-second-year-on-substack/",
        "description": "<p>Two years ago, I quit my job to start Platformer. Last year I told you all how it was going, and to my surprise, it became one of the most popular posts of the year. With that in mind, today I want to reflect on what I learned in year two, and tell you about some of the changes I’m making in response.</p>\n<p>When I announced Platformer, I described my reasoning this way: “By going independent I hope to demonstrate that reader-funded reporters can survive and even thrive, breathing new life into a profession that is bleeding out in no small part due to the platforms I cover.”</p>\n<p>Two years later, I’m happy to tell you that — thanks entirely to you — Platformer is a growing and sustainable business. When I left my full-time job at The Verge, there were about 24,000 of you reading every free edition. Last year, that number grew to 49,000. Today, there are just under 75,000 of you. And of that group, thousands have become paid subscribers, funding the growing ambitions I’ll share more about below.</p>\n<p>I think all this speaks to the need for independent, reader-supported journalism about some of the biggest questions of our age: about the relationship between social networks and the world around them; about how technology ought to be built and governed; and about some of the seismic changes that result from innovation.</p>\n<p>I also think it underscores the appeal of this newsletter’s design: one big idea a day, delivered straight to your inbox at a reliable time, without any ads, affiliate links, pop-ups, SEO bait, or any of the other now-familiar features of our digital landscape. Platformer shows up, tells you a few things, and ends. I think the value of this is still somewhat underrated.</p>\n<p>But it only works because you show up every day to read, share, and support me. Whether you’re a free or paid subscriber, thank you for making Platformer the best job of my life. Together, I truly believe we’re helping to prove out a new model for independent journalism, and my hope is that many more will take similar approaches in the future. I hope you feel good about that.</p>\n<p>Anyway!</p>\nWhat I learned\n<p>It’s still a hits business. As was the case last year, most of the moments that drove large numbers of free and paid subscriptions came when I broke news or wrote a piece of analysis that really resonated with you.</p>\n<p>Some of the journalism you funded last year:</p>\n\nI broke the news that Instagram was walking back controversial changes to the app.\nAlong with Zoe Schiffer, I revealed how Twitter’s plans to build an OnlyFans competitor were foiled by its struggles to find and remove illegal content on the platform.\nI brought you one of the first on-the-record interviews with a former TikTok policy manager to explain what working for ByteDance is really like.\n\n<p>I’ve also regularly delivered news from inside Twitter as Elon Musk attempted to buy — and then get out of buying — the company, explored the fascinating case of the man who got fired by his DAO, and became one of the first writers to regularly illustrate my newsletter with DALL-E. These pieces really struck a chord with you, and the business grew accordingly.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that most growth is driven by hits, though, medium-performing posts help the business grow as well. They attract enough subscribers to offset churn — I averaged around 3% churn over the past three months — and often inspire some reader to reach out to me with some new idea or scoop that turns into the next hit.</p>\n<p>That’s the basic flywheel that powers subscription growth, and it continued to work well in year two.</p>\n<p>People will pay you to tell them it’s complicated. Sometimes when I feel like it’s been too long since I’ve had a scoop, a bit of existential dread can creep up on me: Is the work I’m doing here really valuable enough to charge for? (In a related story, I started therapy for the first time this year.)</p>\n<p>What I am forgetting in those moments is that people are generally underserved by the commentary and analysis they find online. Most takes (and many reported articles) are still tuned to perform well on Twitter, and as such they tend to emphasize fear and outrage above all else. Most people experience a broader range of human emotion than these, and so browsing the Twitter timeline, or the stories produced in order to appease it, often leave us feeling empty: We know there is nuance and complexity there that has been sacrificed in hopes of getting retweeted.</p>\n<p>One reason that some newsletters have become successful during this period, I think, is that they are built with different incentives. I write my newsletter assuming you’ll open it whatever it happens to be about that day; I pride myself on writing headlines that, if not exactly boring, at the very least do not over-promise.</p>\n<p>On Twitter, each story competes against every other, warping coverage in ways that can undermine trust. But Platformer competes mostly with the other emails in your inbox — a competition that ought to be much easier to win, if only because there are funnier tweets in Platformer than you will find in most emails.</p>\n<p>Moreover, because I write several times a week, the newsletter has an episodic format that makes it resistant to the more obnoxious forms of punditry. I don’t have to tell you absolutely everything I think about a particular subject, because I’m almost certainly going to talk about it again in the future. This lets me focus on nuances and trade-offs that folks in the hot-take business might not. (I sometimes joke that the two most common phrases in Platformer are “on one hand” and “on the other,” only at this point I’m not really sure it’s a joke.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, let me give you a concrete example of how this works.</p>\n<p>Last month I wrote about a tricky case involving a man who said he had wrongfully been accused of sharing child abuse materials. The case had been well covered by The New York Times. But I wanted to add some context, and underline some aspects of the case that I felt were getting lost in the discussion. In the next 24 hours, 29 of you became paid subscribers — effectively giving me a $2,900 raise (before taxes and platform fees) for a day’s work of walking through some subtle questions about tech policy.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t happen every day. And some of those folks will churn before the year is over. But I truly wish every reporter could have the experience of getting a raise on the same day they produced something of value to their readers. It’s a powerful signal about the kind of work you want me to do, and helps to guide me to cover subjects that I might have otherwise set aside.</p>\n<p>The Biden era is different. I knew Platformer would be a different publication after President Trump was dislodged from office. Trump was a walking catastrophe for both social networks and democracy, and his election had set in motion the series of events that led me to start writing a newsletter in the first place. (The events of 2016 were particularly difficult for one of my beat companies, which at the time was called Facebook.)</p>\n<p>It took one failed coup and another year, but we’re firmly in the Biden era now. And while we still have no shortage of national crises, they’re not breaking out at the same chaotic frequency as they were during the Trump years. From 2017 to the start of 2021, I almost never struggled to decide what to write about on a given day. By 2022, though, it started to happen with some regularity.</p>\n<p>That led me to explore subjects adjacent to my core focus on social networks: crypto and AI in particular. For the most part, you all came along, even when I was way too credulous (as I was with Axie Infinity). But because I had wedded myself to four columns a week, I often couldn’t manage to do as much reporting as I wanted to.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I think the coming years will bring us chaotic news cycles more reminiscent of the Trump years than the ones we are living in today. In the meantime, though, I think the moment probably calls for less analysis and more reporting overall. There are moments when you want someone to help you to understand what you already read, and there are moments when you want someone to give you some interesting new things to read about. I feel like we’re in a latter such moment right now, and I need to move Platformer in that direction.</p>\n<p>And to that end …</p>\n<p>A four-times-a-week cadence has started to feel like a drag on newsletter quality. The most common question I get about Platformer is how I do it four times a week. The answer is that I rely heavily on the reporting of all the amazing journalists out there illuminating various aspects of tech platforms every day. And when the job is mostly making sense of stories you’re already reading about, I find it enjoyable to show up once a day and try.</p>\n<p>But in a moment that calls for more original reporting, four times a week can feel oppressive. It doesn’t give me enough time to talk to platform employees, read upcoming books, chase newsmakers for Q&amp;As, and wander down blind alleys.</p>\n<p>I want to be clear that what I am describing here is not “burnout.” I love what I do, and if it seemed appropriate for the news cycle, I think four times a week would be the right way to go. But given where we are, I have some other ideas, which I’ll get to below.</p>\n<p>You did not really want Platformer to be a jobs board. I was excited to give that one a shot, and it made a little money, but for the most part you were not clicking on job ads and companies were not buying them. I did like highlighting jobs at nonprofits for free, though; I might want to experiment with some other approaches to this in the future.</p>\n<p>You do like the Discord, though. Sidechannel never quite lived up to the expectations I had for it as a kind of collaborative newsroom of independent journalists. But a solid group of you show up there every day to drop links, share commentary, and analyze events with me in real time. It has been an incredible resource for me this year, in sometimes unexpected ways — such as when some lawyers who had previously argued in Delaware Chancery Court helped us pick apart Elon Musk’s Twitter lawsuit.</p>\n<p>I still think I’ve realized only about 1% of the value of having a Discord server, but this year convinced me that it’s worth investing in.</p>\n<p>Substack figured out some new ways to get newsletters to grow. Last year I wrote here that the only way my newsletter grows is when people tweet about it. As of 2022, though, that’s no longer really the case. Substack did two things that were very helpful here.</p>\n<p>One, Substacks can now recommend each other, and when you sign up for one newsletter, you’ll be asked if you want to subscribe to another publication that the newsletter recommends. I’m grateful to the dozens of Substacks who recommend Platformer; thanks largely to them, I’ve added 9,000 free subscribers since August 1. At the current trajectory, Platformer should easily hit 100,000 free subscribers within the next year. (Also, you can see all my recommendations here.)</p>\n<p>Two, Substack now lets me send paywalled previews to free subscribers. I love having a model that lets me do journalism and send it out for free to anyone who wants it once a week. But sometimes I write something else during the week that I think might cause you all to consider becoming paid subscribers. Paywall previews let me do just that, sending you the top of a story and inviting you to pay to read the rest. I try not to do this too often, but whenever I have I’ve seen great results.</p>\n<p>Substack is also experimenting with a referral program: Some paid subscribers of Platformer will soon be able to give away one-month free subscriptions to their friends and co-workers, in hopes that they will stick around longer.</p>\n<p>So far, none of these have been a game-changer in the way that, say, launching a Discord server for paid subscribers was for me last year. But they’re steps in the right direction.</p>\nWhat’s changing\n<p>So what am I doing with what I learned?</p>\n<p>Last year, I told you that I had two goals for year two: to launch a podcast, and to hire someone to help me. Like any good journalist, I blew right past my deadline. But I’m happy to say that both are happening soon.</p>\n<p>So:</p>\n<p>The podcast is coming October 7. Since February, I’ve been working with The New York Times on a new weekly chat show that will cover tech, business, and our weird future. My co-host is the great Times journalist Kevin Roose, and we’ve spent the past few months exploring ideas and developing something we’re proud of.</p>\n<p>Collaborating with the Times and its incredible producers, artists, composers, and other teams has been a career highlight. I could say a lot more about the show, but I’d rather you just listen to it. To that end, the trailer drops next week — that’s when we’ll share the name of the show, by the way — and the first episode will premiere a week later.</p>\n<p>I’m moving from four guaranteed text posts a week to three. For the podcast to be as good as it can be, I need to set aside a day during the week to focus on it. The timing feels right to make this change: the news cycle is a beat slower than it was during the Trump era, and moving to three posts a week will give me more time to do the additional reporting I want to do.</p>\n<p>The way I’m thinking about this is that my output will basically be the same, but the fourth “post” of the week will be a podcast — one whose editorial interests align closely with what we talk about around here. And that podcast is going to contain original journalism, by the way: we’ll be interviewing newsmakers, Times journalists, and anyone else who can help explain the moment to us.</p>\n<p>And so, with that in mind, this week Platformer moves to its new schedule: you can expect posts from me Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, with the podcast arriving Friday morning. As always, I may write more depending on the news. But I won’t regularly be writing on Wednesdays any more.</p>\n<p>I hired someone. For some time now I’ve been looking for someone who can help me summarize the links in each day’s post, to edit my typos and to catch my broken links. I’ve also been seeking someone to help me on the operational side, working to grow the newsletter and business overall.</p>\n<p>I’m excited to tell you that I’ve found just such a person — and, as a bonus, this person also does incredible journalism in their own right. I can’t say who it is just yet, But I’m excited to do that very soon — and to share their work with you here over the coming year.</p>\nIn conclusion\n<p>The day I announced Platformer, I said I wanted to create a “tiny media company.” As of this week, that company is now a bit less tiny: paid subscribers are now funding not one but two jobs in journalism, and in time there could be an opportunity grow even further.</p>\n<p>From the bottom of my heart, thank you for supporting me these past two years. I truly believe that year three is set to the best yet: more newsy; more multimedia; more curious. If that sounds fun to you, and you haven’t become a paid subscriber, now’s the time.

        "description": "<p>Building on earlier work that showed how former U.S. president Donald Trump could set the political agenda using Twitter, we conducted a systematic examination of the accuracy of the tweets of politicians in three countries: the U.S., the U.K., and Germany.</p>\n<p>Along with colleagues David Garcia, Fabio Carrella, Almog Simchon, and Segun Aroyehun, we collected all available tweets from former and current members of the U.S. Congress, the German parliament, and the British parliament. Combined, we collected more than 3 million tweets posted from 2016 to 2022.</p>\n<p>Politicians from mainstream parties in the U.K. and Germany post few links to untrustworthy websites on Twitter, and this has remained constant since 2016, according to our new research. By contrast, U.S. politicians post a much higher percentage of untrustworthy content in their tweets, and that share has been increasing steeply since 2020.</p>\n\n<p>What is unique about the situation in the US is that there is a very clear temporal trend: sharing of untrustworthy news sources by Republican Congress Members has doubled between 2016-18 and 2020-22 while the proportion of untrustworthy links for Democrats stays stable: </p>\n<p>6/12 pic.twitter.com/gDqVyKbv2R</p>\n<p>— Dr. Jana Lasser (@janalasser) September 22, 2022</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We also found systematic differences between the parties in the U.S., where Republican politicians were found to share untrustworthy websites more than nine times as often as Democratic politicians.</p>\n<p>For Republican politicians, overall around 4% (one in 25) links came from untrustworthy sites, compared with around 0.4% (one in 250) among Democratic politicians. That gap has widened in the last few years. Since 2020, more than 5% of tweets from Republican members of Congress contained links to untrustworthy information. Democratic politicians predominantly share information that is trustworthy, we found.</p>\n<p>Over the five-year period we studied, mainstream elected U.K. members of parliament shared only 74 links to misinformation (0.01% of all their tweets), compared with 4,789 (1.8%) from elected mainstream U.S. politicians and 812 (1.3%) from German politicians.</p>\n<p>To determine the trustworthiness of information shared by the politicians, we extracted all links to external websites contained in the tweets and then used the NewsGuard database to assess the trustworthiness of the domain being linked to. NewsGuard curates a large number of sites in numerous different countries and languages and evaluates them along nine criteria that characterize responsible journalism — for example, whether a site publishes corrections and whether it differentiates between opinion and news.</p>\n\n<p>We then used @NewsGuardRating ratings to assess the trustworthiness of the links they shared. Here is the proportion of untrustworthy domains (score &lt;60) colored by party for the US (on a log scale!):</p>\n<p>4/12 pic.twitter.com/6cCPYj5yDq</p>\n<p>— Dr. Jana Lasser (@janalasser) September 22, 2022</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Our team looked at members of parliament from the U.K.’s Conservative and Labour parties and from Germany (Greens, SPD, FDP, CDU/CSU), as well as U.S. members of Congress.</p>\n<p>Members of the conservative parties in Germany (CDU/CSU) and the U.K. (Conservatives) shared links to untrustworthy websites more frequently than their counterparts in the center or center-left. However, even conservative parliamentarians in Europe were more accurate than U.S. Democrats, with only around 0.2% (one in 500) links from European conservatives being untrustworthy.</p>\n\n<p>What is unique about the situation in the US is that there is a very clear temporal trend: sharing of untrustworthy news sources by Republican Congress Members has doubled between 2016-18 and 2020-22 while the proportion of untrustworthy links for Democrats stays stable: </p>\n<p>6/12 pic.twitter.com/gDqVyKbv2R</p>\n<p>— Dr. Jana Lasser (@janalasser) September 22, 2022</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We repeated our analyses using a second database of news website trustworthiness instead of NewsGuard. This robustness check was important to minimize the risk of possible partisan bias in what is considered “untrustworthy.”</p>\n<p>The second database was compiled by academics and fact checkers such as Media Bias/Fact Check. Reassuringly, the results matched our primary analyses and we found the same trends.</p>\n<p>The world has been awash with concern about the state of our political discourse for many years now. There is ample justification for this concern, given that 30% to 40% of Americans believe the baseless claim that the presidential election of 2020 was “stolen” by President Biden, and that around 10% of the British public believes in at least one conspiracy theory surrounding Covid-19.</p>\n<p>Much of the discussion of the misinformation problem — and much of the blame — has focused on social media, and in particular the algorithms that curate our news feeds and that may nudge us toward more extreme and outrage-provoking content. There is now considerable evidence that social media has been harmful to democracy in at least some countries.</p>\n<p>However, social media is not the only source of the misinformation problem. Donald Trump made more than 30,000 false or misleading claims during his presidency and there are political leaders in Europe who have a poor track record.</p>\n<p>However, compared with the plethora of research that has focused on the role of social media, and the relationship between technology and democracy more generally, there have been few attempts to systematically characterize the role of political leaders in the dissemination of low-quality information.</p>\n<p>Our results are interesting in light of several recent analyses of the American public’s news diet, which have repeatedly shown that conservatives are more likely to encounter and share untrustworthy information than liberals. To date, the origins of that difference have remained disputed.</p>\n<p>Our results contribute to a potential explanation if we assume that what politicians say sets the agenda and resonates with members of the public. By sharing misinformation, Republican members of Congress not only directly provide misinformation to their followers, but also legitimize the sharing of untrustworthy information more generally.</p>\n<p></p><p>Stephan Lewandowsky is chair of cognitive psychology at the University of Bristol in the U.K. Jana Lasser is a postdoc researcher at Graz University of Technology in Austria.

        "description": "<p>In 2019, after BuzzFeed and Verizon Media announced a combined 1,000 layoffs on the same day, many people who had shared their layoffs on Twitter were inundated with replies telling them to “learn to code.”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t just ill-timed career advice. It was a targeted harassment campaign against media workers that was organized on 4chan by people on the right who hate the mainstream media.</p>\n<p>Memes have been used to target marginalized groups for at least a decade now. A new book by researchers at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy documents how memes and the online communities that produce them sow disinformation and erode trust in the government and the mainstream media. Meme Wars: The Untold Story of the Online Battles Upending Democracy in America explains how the “Stop the Steal” movement — the false idea that the 2020 election was “stolen” from former president Donald Trump — started online and resulted in the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, and used examples from Gamergate, the Occupy Wall Street movement, and Donald Trump’s rise to the presidency to develop its playbook.</p>\n<p>Meme wars are culture wars, the authors write — “accelerated and intensified because of the infrastructure and incentives of the internet, which trades outrage and extremity as currency, rewards speed and scale, and flatten the experience of the world into a never-ending scroll of images and words.”</p>\n<p>In April 2020, co-authors Joan Donovan, the research director at Shorenstein, and Brian Friedberg, a Harvard ethnographer studying online fringe communities, launched a newsletter, “Meme War Weekly,” “that got really grim very quickly,” they told me. It was impossible to write about the political impact of memes on a week-by-week basis without noticing their significant social and political impacts over time. Their Media Manipulation Casebook, a series of case studies published in October 2020, was a precursor to their new book.</p>\n<p>I caught up with Donovan, Friedberg, and Emily Dreyfuss, a technology journalist and 2018 Nieman Fellow, to talk about their book and what journalists can learn from the last 10 years of memes to inform their future coverage of American democracy. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>\n<p></p><p></p>\n<p></p>Hanaa’ Tameez: At what point in your research did you realize you had a book on your hands?<p></p>\n<p></p>Joan Donovan: It was the night of January 6. Brian, Emily, and I were hosting an open Zoom room where journalists were coming in and out and we were talking about the significance of Stop the Steal, these kinds of hashtag movements that had been popping up, and the role that right wing media had played in fomenting such an attack on the U.S. Capitol. We all decided that there was a book here.<p></p>\n<p>In 2016, I had written an article in MIT Tech Review about meme wars in the 2016 election. We had a lot of interesting data lying around and wanted to put it into an internet history. We realized very quickly that our starting point would be the Occupy Wall Street movement and the use of memes to mobilize people in that moment in 2011. Many of the books and writings about the Occupy movement didn’t attend to the fact that it was just as mobilizing for the right as it was for the left. And so we wanted to begin with our understanding of where Andrew Breitbart, Steve Bannon, and Alex Jones got their foothold in social media and meme wars.</p><p></p>\n<p></p>Emily Dreyfuss: [On] January 6, people were asking questions like “How could this be happening?” We were seeing the memes that we had been tracing through Meme Wars Weekly appear on people’s clothing and in the livestream comments. We were also getting so many questions directly from journalists and people who wanted to know Joan and our team’s take — questions like, “How could this event happen? This seems to be coming out of nowhere.”<p></p>\n<p>It wasn’t out of nowhere, but hearing people ask how it could be happening really clarified for me that we actually do know, [whereas many] other people don’t know. Joan and Brian’s research about meme wars had been ongoing for years, but it struck us that this was the perfect vehicle to explain something that other people thought was unexplainable. That night, we wrote the outline for the book.</p><p></p>\n<p></p>Tameez: After writing this, what are your takeaways about where we stand as a society, as a democracy? <p></p>\n<p></p>Brian Friedberg: In these last few months leading up to the midterms, political communication and messaging are clearly trending toward polarization. But then you get big media institutions like CNN signaling a change in tone and focus over where they might have been in the last four years under Trump. There’s also a lot of fatigue within parts of the right with Trump himself, and an understanding that there’s not just a battle for the Republican Party but a battle for the future of MAGA playing out [among] different factions of broadcasters, influencers, and political candidates.<p></p>\n<p>What are the comparable big movements within [the Democratic Party’s political communication]? You have the much discussed adoption of the Dark Brandon meme by more mainstream Democratic figures, potentially signaling an entrance into the meme wars. We have yet to see if that’s actually going to impact the midterms. But there is definitely [increasing] adoption of “us versus them” messaging among most political factions in the U.S. I think we saw the foundation for that in the 10 years leading up to the book.</p><p></p>\n<p></p>Dreyfuss: As the normie on the team, one of the things I learned through while researching this book was just how many communities have lost faith in the power and credibility of institutions in general.<p></p>\n<p>The media itself is a proxy for all types of institutions, including academia and government. I was awakened to that through the course of researching this book, and then I couldn’t unsee it. With Roe v. Wade and what’s going on with the Supreme Court in the U.S. right now, I think we’re watching that lack of trust in the system increasing on the left, as well as the right. Our book focuses a lot on the right, and there are a lot of people who feel that way on the right, but in the U.S., a lot of people feel that way on the left as well.</p><p></p>\n<p></p>Tameez: Where do you think the press first went wrong?<p></p>\n<p></p>Donovan: In the book we talk about significant moments of meme warfare occurring around Obama, particularly the way in which he was caricatured using Joker memes, [and] the conspiracy theories, particularly birtherism, that plagued his tenure as president.<p></p>\n<p>One of the things that is important to understand here is that memes don’t just come in the form of an image with some quippy text. They’re viral slogans, too. They’re the activation of people’s confirmation bias and stereotypes. As we watched political opponents begin to memeify one another and push these tropes — some with the intention of sowing disinformation, others with the intention of spreading propaganda — I think many journalists were initially very dismissive.</p>\n<p>One big example is the way in which the alt-right arrived in the media landscape. It’s not that journalists were unable to understand the rise of a white supremacist movement, but they refused to call it what it was. Instead, they used the branding and memes that had been drudged up by these groups that were specifically seeking to rebrand themselves…they didn’t know they were being played.</p>\n<p>So you saw the rise, not just of the alt-right, but of a key figure in the alt-right with Richard Spencer, who was able to use all of that media attention to garner and recruit people into this movement, which then manifested and moved [into the real world] at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, where many people were injured and a woman died.</p>\n<p>When we’re trying to understand where the media is culpable in meme wars, it’s not just that they dropped the ball, but also that some in the mainstream media thought use of the term “alt-right” wasn’t something that they needed to concern themselves with. In doing so, they spread the meme very far.</p><p></p>\n<p></p>Dreyfuss: During those periods of time, I was a reporter and an editor at Wired. Internet culture was treated, for a very long time, like its own side beat. If it was happening online, it would go into the tech section of a newspaper and not be treated with the gravitas that, perhaps, [it might get] if someone was making those statements on television or in other legacy formats. And then the press became very attuned to Twitter trends.<p></p>\n<p>The media treating Twitter like an assignment editor is one of the fundamental errors that enabled meme warriors to play everyone. It showed that if they could get [something] to trend enough, then they’d get a story about it. In the era of social media taking all the ad sales out of journalism, it became even more important for journalists to write more, have a lot of content, and be covering the thing that everyone was talking about, which then created a snowball effect.</p>\n<p>If something trended and someone covered it, a million other people covered it as well. It really reinforced things like the term “alt-right,” and if you then asked where the term “alt-right” even came from, it was very hard to find the origin because of all that content that used the term without questioning it. At Wired, we used “alt-right” for a very long time until it occurred to us: “Whoa, wait, is this a problematic phrase?” But at that point, we’d already written a million articles adding to the problem.</p><p></p>\n<p></p>Tameez: In the book, you write about “hate facts,” or misrepresented statistics and pseudoscience that often come up in these communities and target marginalized people. What role does the press play in perpetuating those?<p></p>\n<p></p>Friedberg: Things like crime statistics — real or fudged — or statistics about genomics and IQ keep resurfacing. It’s old stuff. Contemporary, blatantly racialized social science is not acceptable anymore, which is why they keep going back to the past, despite it being debunked by so many informal and formal sources. Things like scientific racism and gender essentialism keep coming up because we haven’t empowered the folks that they hurt systemically.<p></p>\n<p>One of the concurrent problems with the media coverage is that there will often be stand-ins, particularly in the right-wing press. Instead of saying “Black people” are doing something, they’ll say “inner city” or “Chicago.” While they might not be directly quoting these [hate facts], they all line up with the comment sections and the Facebook shares. There’s a lot of informal knowledge-making that happens underneath the mainstream news stories that the outlets aren’t necessarily responsible for. One of the things that we’ve talked about is how the alt-right comment bombed and raided the comment sections of the conservative press, which is why a lot of comments sections on websites disappeared.</p>\n<p>So there are placeholder words and frames that are being accepted, and a lot of uncritical adoption of official statements and statements by police that further criminalize marginalized communities. I think that’s the next frontier that needs to be addressed [and understood]: That this stuff feeds into narratives that keep people impoverished and oppressed.</p><p></p>\n<p></p>Dreyfuss: These narratives get into the mindsets and brains of editors and reporters, so one other thing to look at is which stories get written and which don’t. That’s one of the main ways that the press can and does perpetuate many of these narratives. There was a ton of coverage of Antifa and violence during the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020. In fact, violence at those protests was extremely rare; it was an outlier, but the press is trained to report on outliers. That is a major problem. We write the story that’s odd — and if everyone writes about the odd story, it seems common.<p></p>\n<p></p>Tameez: What do you think are the major takeaways for journalists from Meme Wars?<p></p>\n<p></p>Donovan: Reporting on the meme wars is hard because you don’t know which side is playing you, in the moment. A lot of times, it only becomes apparent after the fact. Journalists might see something come up and think it’s interesting. But they don’t understand is that it might be part of a manipulation campaign, targeting them directly as journalists.<p></p>\n<p>[Journalists need to ask]: Is calling attention to these memes going to improve the audience’s understanding? And then, is covering this going to be damaging in some way? Is it going to give oxygen to those who are trying to wage culture wars?</p>\n<p>The point at which journalists should pay attention to these things is always a tough call, unfortunately. But we’ve noticed over the years that the far right is going to lie to you about who they are. They’re going to lie to you about their intentions are, because their views are fringe, unethical, and antisocial. Journalists are going to have to learn the methods of digital internet forensics and become much more adept at internet sleuthing if they’re going to survive writing about these meme wars. We caution journalists not to get into things that they don’t quite understand.</p>\n<p>My broad advice to journalists is to get to know your beat, and to stay on top of those who are using media manipulation, disinformation, and meme wars to carry out their politics or to make a profit.</p><p></p>\n<p></p>Tameez: Some people say that there’s no difference between “culture” and “internet culture” anymore because the internet is a driving part of our lives and society. Does that logic apply to meme wars, too?<p></p>\n<p></p>Dreyfuss: We find that meme wars are an evolution of culture wars. But the creation of and mass scaling of social media, the infrastructure of the social internet, and the way those things put the power to reach billions of people in everyone’s hands has changed the nature of the way those culture wars can be fought online. They amplified the role that memes can play because of the format.<p></p>\n<p>The impact of meme wars, central to the book, is Joan’s theory that meme wars drive something online to happen in the real world. The meme wars fail if something doesn’t happen in the real world, because the point of them is not to just be online, but to actually influence culture.</p><p></p>\n<p></p>Donovan: I would add that there’s no more “offline.” If you’re a child of the early internet days of AOL, it was very clear when you were online, because you literally were plugged into a phone line that was plugged into the wall. We started the book with the Occupy Wall Street movement because it was the first huge instance in the U.S. of social media moving into public spaces and promoting civil disobedience.<p></p>\n<p></p>Tameez: What is your tech stack? How do you protect yourselves online and mentally?<p></p>\n<p></p> Donovan: I’d rather not reveal it. We use a mishmash of corporate products that delete content from the internet or make it difficult to collect our phone records, email addresses, and whatnot. We also have physical security protocols that make it more difficult for people to access us. Then we have some friendly people who monitor these spaces and keep an eye out for our names and information about people on our teams. That’s about all I’m willing to say about that publicly.<p></p>\n<p>The work is rewarding when you see things getting done that are outside of your purview. As researchers, we know the work that we do is of global importance. When journalists give us feedback saying that they were able to write better stories because of our research, when technologists say they were able to create better software because of our work, when civil society actors say they were able to influence culture or policy in certain directions, when members of Congress say thank you for the research that we do — that, to me, is a really important protective element.</p>\n<p>If we were doing this work and sort of screaming into the void and watching as democracies fail, it would be hard to keep doing it. But we know the work that we’re doing is getting taken up by important decision-makers and stakeholders, and is protecting other people from going through some of these very damaging campaigns. There’s a sense of justice in the work that you don’t get from many other jobs.</p><p></p>\n<p></p>Dreyfuss: There is power in explaining something that is happening in the world and figuring it out. The existence of this book, and a lot of the work that we do as a team, is about recognizing that something is happening and figuring out why. Life is full of unknowable things and unknown things. There is some power and calmness that comes from [the recognition] that this is not an unknowable problem.<p></p>\n<p></p>Friedberg: I almost exclusively consume some kind of indie media. At this point, the far right is just one of the many voices I listen to on a daily basis. I would rather triangulate between a real Nazi podcast and a real lefty podcast than between CNN and Fox News. I prefer this side of the media world.<p></p>\n<p></p>Tameez: Is there anything else you want to add?<p></p>\n<p></p>Donovan: We conclude the book by thinking about what memes have to do with people’s nationalistic identities. Right now U.S. politics is fracturing around who gets to define it means to be American. Who gets to claim that status? Under what conditions do we consider someone “patriotic” versus “nationalistic”?<p></p>\n<p>The people who have most been marginalized by our political system use the tools of new media to be seen and be heard. But that doesn’t necessarily make social media good for a society. Social media is now overrun with very powerful politicians and very powerful rich men who have a very particular political agenda.</p>\n<p>Even though social media as a technology hasn’t really changed that much over the last decade, its users have, and it’s become much more ubiquitous. It’s become much more of a tool of the powerful to oppress, rather than a weapon of the weak to liberate. As journalists are thinking about what stories they should be telling, they should turn their eye to the groups of people who are the most marginalized, who are struggling for recognition. They should not assume that just because a few accounts on social media are being loud that that means the whole multiplicity of that identity is represented.</p>\n<p>The way in which social media is structured is almost like a distorted mirror of our society. It’s imperative that journalists understand that they are on the front lines of the meme wars, and that they can really shift the balance if they shift who they spotlight and what stories they choose to tell. </p><p></p>",

        "link": "https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/09/adnan-syed-is-released-and-so-is-a-new-episode-of-the-first-season-of-serial/",
        "description": "<p>The first two episodes of Serial were released just about eight years ago today, on October 3, 2014. A couple of weeks before the launch, on September 19, 2014, executive producer and host Sarah Koenig wrote on the Serial blog:</p>\n<p>This murder story we’ve been working on, it’s captivated all of us at Serial for a year. Once we started looking into it, we realized the story was so much messier and more complicated — and more interesting — than what the jury got to hear. We hope you’ll get sucked in the way we have.</p>\n<p>Serial launched as a spinoff of This American Life, and its first episode aired in that show’s radio slot. “For us, that it’s a podcast is so liberating,” Koenig told Nieman Lab at the time. “We can tell it as long as we need to tell it, and we don’t have to worry about it.”</p>\n<p>They also expected the audience for Serial to be small. “It will be interesting, once we start podcasting more, if the audience feels different than the audience we have for This American Life right now,” executive producer Julie Snyder told us back then. “I’m not sure — it will certainly be much smaller.”</p>\n<p>It was not much smaller. Serial topped the iTunes charts even before its launch. On November 23, 2014, David Carr wrote in The New York Times:</p>\n<p>To call something the most popular podcast might seem a little like identifying the tallest leprechaun, but the numbers are impressive for any media platform. “Serial” has been downloaded or streamed on iTunes more than five million times — at a cost of nothing — and averages over 1.5 million listeners an episode. That is as many people as watch an episode of “Louie,” the buzzed-about comedy on FX. Ira Glass, the host of “This American Life,” told me his show took four years to reach one million listeners. “Serial” raced past that in a month.</p>\n<p>Serial spawned a Saturday Night Live skit, a bestselling book and four-part HBO documentary series, and a wave of true crime podcasts that still hasn’t abated. “Only Murders in the Building,” which just wrapped up its second season on Hulu, follows three Upper West Side neighbors who start a true crime podcast after their neighbor is murdered.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The show also came in for criticism, especially from those who argued that Koenig overlooked major elements of the story involving racial prejudice, Islamophobia, social justice, and the failure of the criminal justice system. “What happens when a white journalist stomps around in a cold case involving people from two distinctly separate immigrant communities? Does she get it right? (Spoilers ahead.),” Jay Caspian King wrote in The Awl in December 2014, in a post entitled “White Reporter Privilege.” Rabia Chaudry — Adnan Syed’s childhood friend, who first brought the story to Sarah Koenig and who went on to write that bestselling book, produce that HBO series, and launch a criminal justice podcast — told King:</p>\n<p>“You have an urban jury in Baltimore city, mostly African American, maybe people who identify with Jay [an African-American friend of Syed’s who is the state’s seemingly unreliable star witness] more than Adnan, who is represented by a community in headscarves and men in beards. The visuals of the courtroom itself leaves an impression and there’s no escaping the racial implications there. […]</p>\n<p>I don’t know to what extent someone who hasn’t grown up in a culture can really understand that culture. I think Sarah tried to get it, but I don’t know if she ever really did. I explained to her that anti-Muslim sentiment was involved in framing the motive in this case, and that Muslims can pick up on it, whereas someone like her, who hasn’t experienced this kind of bigotry, doesn’t quite get it. Until you’ve experienced it, you don’t really know it or pick up on it.”</p>\n<p>In 2015, Ira Glass acquired full control of This American Life. Later that year, the show’s second season, about the disappearance of U.S. solder Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in Afghanistan, was released. A wildly successful spinoff podcast, S-Town, came out in March 2017. In 2020, The New York Times acquired Serial Productions: “For the people who love Serial — and there are millions of them,” the Times’ Sam Dolnick told Nick Quah, “the idea here is to have more Serials.”</p>\n<p>Through the years, Adnan Syed’s case continued to wind through the courts. He maintained that he was innocent. This month, prosecutors asked a judge to overturn overturn the 2000 murder conviction and release Syed, which Baltimore judge on Monday did on Monday. Prosecutors have 30 days to proceed with a new trial or drop his conviction.</p>\n<p>The murder of Hae Min Lee remains unsolved. “This is not a podcast for me. It’s real life that will never end — it’s been 20-plus years,” her brother, Young Lee, told the judge via Zoom call on Monday. </p>\n<p>Sarah Koenig told The New York Times on Tuesday that she was “shocked” to hear that prosecutors wanted Syed released and that it was “like the city prosecutor’s office suddenly pulled off a rubber mask and underneath was a scowling defense attorney.” Serial was once again the top show on Apple Podcasts on Tuesday, with the release of a new episode: S01E13, “Adnan Is Out.” The intro music is the same as it was in 2014, but there are no Mailkimp ads this time around (Update: One of our readers did hear a Mailkimp ad when streaming the episode on Serial’s website!)</p>\n<p>“The prosecutors today are not saying Adnan is innocent. They stopped short of exonerating him,” Koenig says in the episode. “Instead they’re saying that ‘Back in 1999, we didn’t investigate this case thoroughly enough. We relied on evidence we shouldn’t have. And we broke the rules when we prosecuted. This wasn’t an honest conviction.’ According to the prosecutor’s office, they didn’t set out to pick apart Adnan’s case — their own case, mind you. They say it just kind of crumpled once they took a hard look. [pause] I know.”</p>\n\n<p>Fascinating to hear a Serial update on Adnan Syed’s release that’s so bare-bones, similar to the rundowns that other media are offering. It’s not like I expected them to produce a season of reflection on their own role in a day, but there’s probably a season of reflecting to do.</p>\n<p>— Linda Holmes (@lindaholmes) September 20, 2022</p>\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Today’s episode of Serial is…fine.

        "description": "<p>Do you like scary movies?</p>\n<p>Did you stand in line for a midnight viewing of “The Blair Witch Project“? Does “Heeeeere’s Johnny!” evoke late-night nostalgia or hatchet-wielding terror? Clowns: for or against?</p>\n<p>Horror movies are one of the few consumer goods that people buy specifically to feel anxious and scared — normally considered negative emotions. (See also: roller coasters.) No one would want to walk around feeling terrified all day, but the adrenaline spike of a good controlled scare can be exhilarating to someone with the right amygdala.</p>\n<p>Still, one of the defining characteristics of scary movies (and roller coasters) is that many people don’t like them. Those people run a cost-benefit analysis — lots of thrills! but also lots of fear! — and don’t see a tradeoff worth making. Invite them out for the latest Jordan Peele movie and watch them nope-nope-nope their way home.</p>\n<p>While the news on any given day is only metaphorically a horror show, many people treat headlines less as information than as scary stimuli. They’d rather not be regularly reminded of all that’s broken in the world, with all-new horrors added by the hour. They’ve got plenty of other stuff to do, so why spend time doing something that will make them anxious?</p>\n<p>This phenomenon can seem foreign to some journalists — who, after all, are people who’ve chosen to spend most of their waking hours swimming in the latest news. But news avoidance is a very real phenomenon and, frankly, a deeply rational one for many people who see news as high risk, low reward.</p>\n<p>That’s the subject of a new paper out from our old friends Benjamin Toff and Rasmus Kleis Nielsen in the journal Political Communication. It’s titled “How News Feels: Anticipated Anxiety as a Factor in News Avoidance and a Barrier to Political Engagement,” and here’s the abstract (emphases, as always, mine):</p>\n<p></p>This study uses an inductive, qualitative approach to examine the perspectives of lower- and middle-class people in the United Kingdom who regularly access little or no professionally-produced news. <p></p>\n<p>Findings suggest that people’s preexisting perspectives about what news is (anxiety-inducing) and offers for them (little practical value) play an important role in shaping attitudes toward news and subsequent behavior. These perspectives highlight the importance of emotional dimensions of news use beyond its presumed value as a source of information. </p>\n<p>While political communication scholarship has often treated news consumption as the cornerstone of good citizenship, we find avoiders hold uneven, weakly internalized norms about a perceived duty to stay informed, in part because they anticipate news will make them anxious without being relevant to their lives, resulting in limited engagement with news, and by extension, civic and political affairs. Promoting more informed societies requires grappling with these entrenched perspectives.</p><p></p>\n<p>Nielsen and (especially) Toff have been digging into news avoidance for years. (See here, here, here, here, here, or here.) And it’s a growing problem. The latest Digital News Report tracks the increase across countries. The proportion of people who say they “sometimes” or “often” actively avoid the news in:</p>\n<p>Brazil: 2017: 27% → 2022: 54%<br />\nU.K.: 2017: 24% → 2022: 46%<br />\nAustralia: 2017: 30% → 2022: 41%<br />\nIreland: 2017: 30% → 2022: 41%<br />\nU.S.: 2017: 38% → 2022: 42%</p>\n<p>Why do people check out of news? Among the reasons they give: They feel worn out; it’s too confusing; it makes them feel depressed; it leads to argument; it makes them feel powerless.</p>\n<p>This new paper draws from in-depth, hour-long interviews with 43 U.K. residents who say they avoid news. And I mean avoid: These are people who say they consume professionally-produced news “less than once a month” or “never,” ranking them in the bottom 7% of the U.K. in terms of their news habits. (In other words, these aren’t people who rail against the “mainstream media” but spend their days hoovering up news that fits their political beliefs. These people say they consume no or next-to-no news at all.)</p>\n<p>The group interviewed tended to be somewhat poorer and less educated than the U.K. as a whole; most came from lower-middle-class backgrounds and there were more women than men.</p>\n<p>(It’s also important to note these interviews were conducted between November 2016 and March 2017, for two reasons. First: That was an extraordinary period in the news. In the U.S., it covers Donald Trump’s shock election through his first two months in office. In the U.K., it’s between the June 2016 Brexit referendum and the formal start of the withdrawal process on March 29, 2017. Avoiding the news then would seem to require an iron will. Second, 2017 was a while back in news avoidance terms, so the interviews are snapshots of the recent past.)</p>\n<p>What’d they find?</p>\n<p></p>We find that (1) many perceive the actual content of news as intensely negative and largely devoid of information relevant to their lives; and (2) many expressed deep ambivalence about the civic importance of staying informed, documenting that more abstract norms encouraging news use were weakly and unevenly internalized. <p></p>\n<p>Many conceptions about news and news use are captured in these exchanges, but the way in which preconceived perspectives generate anticipated anxiety and shape encounters with news are particularly notable. News is seen as emotionally taxing — a source of uncertainty and lack of control — making it an obstacle to deeper political engagement in a complex and upsetting world.</p><p></p>\n<p>Some of the most common complaints (the interviewees are identified using pseudonyms):</p>\nThe news is all about crime and war and terrorism.\n<p></p>Perceptions that news was dominated by such [crime] stories often generated visceral reactions among study participants; “I genuinely got sick,” Robert explained, when he read about “sex offenders and stuff like that and how a sex offender would get free and they’d only serve one year and stuff like that.”<p></p>\n<p>For parents of young children, crime stories hit particularly hard. Chelsea said the last news story she could recall concerned a 16-year-old boy who was stabbed “walking home from school.” She said, “It was very close to our house, and it was on the radio, I think my mum had heard it on [the TV news program] ‘Calendar,’ the kids had heard it all over the computer.” Because the victim was a similar age as her son, “it’s quite close to the bone.”</p><p></p>\n<p></p>“We had the London bombings and everything like that and that just brings it home that it will come to us. And when the London bombings, the train and the bus, that highlighted the fact that nobody is safe, it doesn’t matter where on the planet you are, you’re not safe. And I think reading things where people are like, ‘Oh we’ve got a bit of knowledge that something is going to happen,’ it upsets you and you worry and then nowt happens, so you’re worrying yourself unjustly.” (Andrea)<p></p>\n<p></p>Kate, who works in customer service for a travel agency, described how a terrorist incident in Tunisia had a particular effect on her “even though we’re obviously nowhere near Tunisia.” She said, “It still was scary, because it was kind of like the…It wasn’t the first one, but it was very big, wasn’t it? And very unexpected. I think that’s kind of when I was at the point where I was, ‘It can actually happen anywhere.’” She said she could not bring herself to pay attention to the news because “in general, I’m just a nervous person when it comes to crime and death and stuff like that. Anything like that scares me.”<p></p>\nThe news is depressing.\n<p></p>Olivia recalled a conversation with her mother about news involving vivid details about a priest who “got his head beheaded in France and it’s like…with a knife…it’s not a clean thing, is it?” She recounted telling her mother, “I’m going to have nightmares now, thanks for that. I don’t even know. After that I was like no, I don’t want to know anything. Why are you telling me that?”<p></p>\n<p></p>[Megan] said she briefly used a news app on her phone years ago in an effort to stay better informed but found it to be “so depressing so I just got rid of it.”<p></p>\n<p></p>Haylie, a lawyer and also a self-professed anxious person, offered the same view: “I don’t want to pick up newspapers and things like that because of the bad news, the things that I can’t do anything about.” She attributed her news avoidance in part to advice she read in a self-help guide, “I never really enjoyed the news on TV, so that wasn’t any hardship.”<p></p>\nThe news isn’t useful to me, and I don’t care about politics.\n<p></p>Some viewed news as mostly substance free (“mindless, celebrity reporting about rubbish” as Jodie put it) while others perceived news to be synonymous with politics which they saw as “boring” arguments between partisans. Few study participants had a stake in such debates; nearly two-thirds said they did not identify with or even lean toward any established political party. As Emily put it: “I just always think it’s the same kind of thing. There’s always somebody arguing for, and somebody always arguing against. And then they just do what they want anyway, don’t they?”<p></p>\n<p></p>When considering news about the “political and financial,” [Jodie] said “it just doesn’t mean anything to me, so I just switch off.” Others expressed similar sentiments: “I don’t really understand like the different parties and stuff,” Brenna said when asked about conversations she recalled involving news.<p></p>\n<p></p>When asked a standard survey question about placement on a left-right ideological scale, several participants asked for clarification, and a majority responded “don’t know.” Ryan, for example, said he felt he was too uninformed: “I’m like a sheep,” he said. “I couldn’t tell you one policy, I couldn’t tell you one difference between Labour and Conservative.” Amelia felt the same, asking, “Do you know like with the political party thing…? I’ve got my views on like what I think about the government, but I don’t understand what both parties have.”<p></p>\nThe news is too confusing, and it doesn’t matter, anyway.\n<p></p>“Like personally for me, I thought we should stay in the EU because I believe in community and even on a global scale I think it’s a good thing. But if I read the newspaper it breaks it all down into these tiny little things. And I think there’s so much for me to catch up on. I spent 30 years not really paying much attention to the news. There’s so much to catch up on that it blows my mind, that I don’t understand what’s going on. So I sort of gave up really.” (Gracie)<p></p>\n<p></p>Uncertainty about political matters was difficult to disentangle from a persistent cynicism about civic affairs, a view that ordinary citizens were unlikely to have any agency or impact on the world’s problems. This lack of political efficacy echoed across interviews: “My vote is not going to count, if I did vote…it’s just another one” (Ryan); “I don’t really feel like I’ve got much control over what’s going on in the world; I’m just one person” (Jane); “I can’t worry about it too much. Because I can’t change it. Especially reading the newspaper. That’s not gonna get you anywhere” (Gracie); “Nobody is going to listen to me” (Chelsea); “I really don’t think anything makes a difference what anyone says because it all goes on what the people at the top say, and I think that’s all that matters, I really do” (Amelia).<p></p>\n<p></p>As Chelsea explained, “Obviously, I could be a little bit more into what’s going on and look myself,” but given her views about how politics works, she did not see the point. “Knowing more about it doesn’t do anything about it, does it?”<p></p>\n<p></p>Between the uncertainty and stasis of politics, and the barrage of “images at night of just wars going on, just gunshots” and other “terrifying” topics, as Lilia summed up her perceptions of news, many viewed tuning out as a survival skill. Lilia called avoiding the news her “self-defense mechanism,” a way of focusing on more manageable tasks within her control. “What can I do? I can’t change that.”<p></p>\nI’m not obliged to follow the news (but I feel a little bad about it sometimes).\n<p></p>Emily, for example, who had shielded herself from even incidental exposure online and offline as a strategy for coping with anxiety strongly rejected the view that it was important to stay informed: “Not at all. No. Again, if it doesn’t affect [you], then it’s pointless.” But as she continued, she began to second guess herself. “Maybe that’s naïve, maybe it’s wrong. Maybe I should pay more attention, but…I don’t think there’s a right or wrong answer.” She concluded, “It’s not against the law not to watch the news.”<p></p>\n<p></p>Lilia said her father “used to tell me off for not watching the news.” She thought perhaps her own lack of interest stemmed from that feeling of obligation: “You know when your parents tell you to do something and you just don’t because they’ve told you to? Maybe it’s something to do with that. I was always like, ‘No, I’m not interested!’”<p></p>\n<p></p>Study participants often made similar self-deprecating comments about their own lack of interest in the news, as though their failure to take an interest in news reflected poorly on their character — or at least that they should feel that way. Jane, for example, reflecting on her limited news exposure, exclaimed, “Bloody hell, I’m like living in some little bubble, aren’t I?” Jennifer said talking about her lack of interest made her feel “a bit stupid now.” Jodie, a middle-class mother of three, worried it reflected poorly on her as a parent. She recounted her son’s English teacher chastising her, explaining, “We don’t buy any newspapers at all, which I think is really bad.” <p></p>\n<p>In another example, Lilia said she wanted to be “one of those people who just bought a Guardian every weekend and just sat and read the whole thing.” When asked why, she said, “I feel a bit stupid sometimes because people will be talking about, ‘Oh, this is happening,’ and I’m like, ‘I don’t know what you’re on about,’ and just shy away from the conversation.”</p><p></p>\n<p>Underlying all these responses is anxiety — either the experience of it or the anticipation of it. Reading the news is like entering a lottery with only bad prizes: You’ll probably emerge unscathed — but why even play if you’re not going to get anything valuable out of it? Sure, the roller coaster is probably safe — but why get on it at all if you’re going to hate every minute?</p>\n<p>If you work in news, these ideas might seem downright foreign. But after all the insanity of the past decade or so, I suspect even journalists understand where these people are coming from. We’ve all had some moment where the news has been so overwhelming that we wanted to step back, close Twitter, and ignore the outside world for a while. News avoiders have the same reaction — they just have a much lower threshold for triggering it. </p>\n<p>Instead of FOMO, they’ve got ROMO — the relief of missing out. </p>\n<p>Nielsen and Toff:</p>\n<p></p>As Coleman (2013, p. 4) has argued, “the sustainability of any social practice depends to a large measure on how it feels to participate in it.” Our analysis of how news avoiders — people who say they use little or no professionally-produced news — feel about news underlines the importance of anticipated anxiety in contributing to disengagement with news.<p></p>\n<p>Those we interviewed all had access to an abundant supply of news and were capable individuals navigating sometimes challenging and always demanding lives. Some of them also had an abstract sense that they ought to follow the news. Nonetheless, they consumed little of it, associating news with anxiety and believing it offered little to make them feel more in control or certain about how to navigate their lives. </p>\n<p>Balancing often weakly and unevenly internalized norms of citizenship against the perspective that news is mainly “doom and gloom” and useless “rubbish,” which only reinforces already limited efficacy, our interviewees mostly turn their backs on what some scholars have called the “primary sense-making practice of modernity” (Hartley, 1996). Many do this with ambivalence, a sense that perhaps they should engage more, but their sense of civic duty is overshadowed by considerations such as self-care. </p>\n<p>Through the lens of the specific perspectives we have identified here, news avoidance is cast as a reasonable choice. It feels better than the alternative, and there is no strong sense of missing out.</p><p></p>",

        "link": "https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/09/kqed-started-tracking-sources-heres-exactly-how-they-did-it/",
        "description": "<p>There are many reasons to track your newsroom’s sources, and many ways to do so. At KQED, creating our own source tracker allowed us to discuss newsroom priorities, involve hesitant staff, and hold ourselves accountable for who we feature in our stories.</p>\n<p>When journalists talk about source tracking and the challenges of culture change in a newsroom to embrace this key task, we often focus on buy-in and accountability. What can sometimes be lost is the nitty-gritty of how, what demographic data we’re collecting, and why. </p>\n<p>When it comes to collecting demographic data, there’s no shortage of information a reporter can ask of their source: age, gender, profession, location and more. The list can be expansive, and when a journalist is on a tight deadline — and concerned about burdening a source who’s already answered several questions about a subject — it’s important to develop a questionnaire that works for your newsroom staff, while meeting the goals of the organization. </p>\n<p>KQED is the largest public media organization in California and has one of the largest newsrooms in Northern California. In our coverage we strive to identify structural inequities and are aware of how we in the media might replicate those injustices by relying on the same sources over and over in our news coverage. There are several ways to improve our coverage through staffing and story framing, but we can also try to address inequities by being conscientious about who we feature in our coverage over a period of time. This is why we co-created a source tracking questionnaire with our staff.</p>\n<p>Below we explain how we developed our questionnaire, how a lack of participation among staff created problems in mapping an accurate snapshot, and how we developed solutions to address compliance. We also examine the responsibility managers have in implementing change in the newsroom. </p>\nPhase 1: The road to a retrospective source audit\n<p>At KQED, we had been mulling the benefits of a source audit for years, and finally in 2019 got buy-in from organizational leadership to work with an outside organization to conduct a retrospective audit of radio segments, web articles, and podcast episodes to set a baseline for our future work. The goal of the audit, launched in July 2020, was to determine whose voices were heard and seen by our audiences. Many journalists think they’re talking to a variety of sources, but we decided to truly test out those assumptions by gathering data on gender, race and ethnicity, geography, and job titles. (Note: A source audit is a retrospective view of past work, while source tracking is present-day work.)</p>\n<p>The one-time 2020 source audit allowed us to establish a baseline. We outsourced that work to Impact Architects, which specializes in source audits for newsrooms. You can read the results here.</p>\n<p>However, we did not have a dedicated budget to continue that third-party work. We needed — and wanted — our journalists to take over the responsibility of tracking sources in KQED News’s stories. </p>\n<p>We had reviewed several source-tracking questionnaires, but every newsroom is different. We tried to create a questionnaire that aligned with the retrospective results to track year-over-year information on race, gender, location, and profession. However, once we started testing that questionnaire with staff, we received a ton of questions, and that presented an opportunity: We needed to create our own form. </p>\n<p>Guided by KQED News department’s editorial North Star and our focus on systems, solutions, and equity, we wanted to create a questionnaire that worked for our culture and aligned with reporters’ busy schedules.</p>\nPhase 2: Growing pains of a new workflow\n<p>In order to create a questionnaire, first, you need a team. It’s easy to think of tasks as single-person assignments because you don’t want to tie up more resources. However, working in teams is critical for stress-testing assumptions and creating support systems in times of challenging work. </p>\n<p>Team roles. We settled on three roles: Data specialist, facilitator, and enforcer. In newsrooms across the country, data journalists have played a significant role in source tracking work by providing guidance on tools and data sets and,  often, cleaning the source data and creating reports for internal staff. Data specialists play a critical role in making the source tracking data achievable and manageable. Facilitators can guide staff through difficult conversations and help groups make choices. Enforcers are the ones in top management ranks with the power to tell staff that a new initiative is now a job requirement. These three roles work together because you don’t want to enforce an inadequate tool, nor do you want a great tool without proper enforcement. And neither is very useful without staff buy-in. (You’ll note this article is authored by three people — these were our roles.)</p>\n<p>Staff participation. When the team received pushback from staff over the initial questionnaire, we decided to change tactics by including staff in developing the next version of the form. Who else would be better qualified to create the questions than the people who would be asking them? In March 2021, we embarked on a series of five meetings to make the form work. Each newsroom team associated with a beat, program, or platform was required to appoint one representative who would then become the go-to expert on their team for any questions about the form. We had more than a dozen representatives. </p>\n<p>Asynchronous participation. We made all discussions asynchronous and accessible by working on Slack and making meeting notes always available on a Google doc; these two tools helped mitigate bottlenecks. For example, if a reporter has a question on Slack about how to classify a source, you now have at least a dozen colleagues who can help answer that question. Not everyone works 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in a newsroom and we wanted people to have opportunities to participate regardless of whether staff work on weekend teams, time-shifted, or have caregiving responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Another large benefit of asynchronous participation is that your working documents become a searchable record. This creates transparency about how decisions were made. Also, it allows people to find previous decisions, making your Slack or Google document a living FAQ. </p>\n<p>Conversation. We made time to have deep discussions. We developed our form over five weeks during weekly one-hour meetings with clear ways for people to participate asynchronously. In between those meetings, our representatives solicited feedback from their individual teams. For example, our colleagues felt dissatisfied with using job titles for sources. Several source-tracking projects identify individuals based on their jobs: professor, business person, lawyer. But people in those jobs have varying degrees of power in society, and how they are represented in a story does not automatically reflect the job they have. One can be a professor, but be in a news story as a worker striking for better pay. One can have a business interest without being paid for that work. One can be a lawyer, but speak as a first-person witness to a wildfire. This is where we decided to classify people into the roles they serve in the story and identify what structural power they hold.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Compromise. We had to make the form work, both for the daily workflow of journalists and for the larger goals of the data specialist. Journalists, in their commitment to accuracy, did not like the broad racial and ethnic categorizations that would miss someone’s deep heritage. However, in order to see trends and to have some consistency with existing data sets (such as the Census) and to have a baseline for comparison with our communities, we used the broader racial categories used by the Census and other federal agencies. There is a notes section that reporters can use for anything that is not reported in the broad categories. </p>\n<p>Our colleagues became the best stress testers of this process. For example, in an earlier version of the questionnaire on gender pronouns, we had “other” as a response for someone whose gender pronouns were not listed. Correspondent-producer Suzie Racho tested the form with a guest who informed her that “other” felt like it was marginalizing that person’s gender pronoun, so we updated the form to say “Pronouns not listed; put the pronouns in the notes field at the bottom.” In order to align the information with what a reporter would find useful for their story, we chose pronouns instead of sex. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Workflow. Ultimately, it’s up to our colleagues to develop a workflow, which is why we had a representative from every team to help facilitate the process. Each team is unique. For instance, who should fill out the source questionnaire for a daily talk show — the host who speaks to the source or the producer who books them? What happens to sources that don’t make it into the published story? What about breaking news situations? Having our full staff represented allowed each team to come up with its own workflow. Some teams fill out the form every Friday, some people do it at the end of the month, and others as their stories air or publish. The workflow is different for each team, and reporters learned about one another’s differences on Slack as questions and comments rolled in and were answered by about a dozen qualified representatives.</p>\nOfficial launch: April 1, 2021\n<p>Once we had this staff-developed form, the newsroom felt confident in launching the source tracking form. </p>\n<p>For anyone who’s been through this process, we assume they will have heard the same two most asked and answered questions: </p>\n<p>Q: Is this mandatory?<br />\nA: Yes.</p>\n<p>Q: Can I email my source this form?<br />\nA: No.  \t</p>\n<p>We wanted our reporters to have conversations and ask sources directly to collect the answers, and we knew that emailing the form to sources would remove that 1:1 interaction. The entire purpose of the questionnaire is to have the conversation about race, gender, and identity, which we know even more clearly is at the root of system inequities. We felt good about having a path forward.</p>\n<p>As with many new initiatives, the first month was rocky. Not everyone was filling out the form. But gradually, more and more people started completing the forms. And then, participation began to wane. </p>\n<p>Were journalists not talking to a lot of sources or were they not completing their source tracking forms? Both were problematic. </p>\n<p>Even though the mandatory nature of the source tracking was communicated repeatedly over email, Slack, and Zoom meetings, the participation was lackluster. When comparing Phase 2 completed forms to the sample of stories Impact Architects analyzed in 2020, we realized our staff was lagging far behind where they should be. Staff had been told repeatedly that the form was mandatory. What went wrong? </p>\n<p>We turned to our managers for answers. Our editors are the ones who know their content best. They have the best idea of how many sources their direct reports are speaking with every month. They are most in tune with how many sources appear on a program, segment or platform each month. This is where it’s important to have an enforcer, at the highest level of management, deeply involved with source tracking. </p>\n<p>Our news director and facilitator spent several months’ worth of meetings working with editors to come up with a base number of sources interviewed each month by members of their team. This became the “Denominator Project,” which helped us understand whether staff were completing source tracking forms. </p>\n<p>This fact-finding mission also helped clarify use of the form and helped us to, again, tackle those commonly asked questions. By the end of September 2021, managers were able to unearth gaps in completion, answer questions about whose responsibility it is to complete the form, and get more clarity on who should be involved in a source form. </p>\n<p>The Denominator Project helped teams set targets and know whether their staff were completing their forms. It allowed us to establish a baseline that senior editors were well-positioned to determine once they had some data and deliverables.</p>\nPhase 3: The path to accuracy\n<p>With a baseline in place developed by editors, KQED News reset its course last October to get more accurate source tracking. </p>\n<p>For example, our supervising senior editor of news and newscasts, Ted Goldberg, determined that approximately 200 sources appear in one month’s worth of weekday newscasts. He can look at the source tracking data and can get a better idea of  whether his team is completing them or not. It’s worth noting that during Phase 2, newscasts outperformed all other programs in source tracking completion with at least 100 sources each month, some of it attributed to the sheer volume of newscasts that are produced every day. However, the Denominator Project revealed that the number is closer to 200 sources. Through constant vigilance and making source tracking a part of the daily work conversation, the newscast team maintained its 200-plus sources every month throughout the spring. Once we do a thorough analysis of the sources, we’ll know how the entire newsroom fared in getting an accurate count of its sources. </p>\n<p>We still have a lot of work ahead of us. Tracking our sources is just one of many parts needed to have a more equitable newsroom. But by identifying our shortcomings and creating pathways for improvement, we can continually do better to better serve our audiences.</p>\n<p></p><p>Ki Sung (the facilitator) is managing editor of digital news at KQED.

        "description": "<p>As the midterm elections loom, there’s a lot of talk about threats to democracy, and what to do about it. One recent poll even showed this as the issue of most concern to voters. News organizations have created teams to cover democracy as a beat. Possible stories abound, from the January 6 investigation, to gerrymandering and voter suppression, to struggles over the administration of the election machinery itself.</p>\n<p>I want to talk about something more prosaic, but in many local communities perhaps likely to have greater impact: ways newsrooms can directly aid voters in making the critical choices they face. I hope this may be of practical use, even over the next seven weeks.</p>\nA look at eight major cities\n<p>Earlier this year, I did some research for my consulting clients at the Lenfest Institute for Journalism in Philadelphia on what might be learned from such efforts in the closely contested mayoral elections in other large cities over the last three years, including Atlanta, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Nashville, New York, and Pittsburgh, as well as selected efforts elsewhere. This column draws heavily on that research. In the practical spirit, it contains quite a few links.</p>\n<p>It turns out that sophisticated, interactive voter guides — digital turns on the work long performed by organizations like the League of Women Voters — are among the most effective techniques adopted by newer news organizations, as well as more established players seeking to engage voters and potential voters. Among the most successful of these appear to have been those published recently by The City in New York, the Texas Tribune and a consortium of Chicago newsrooms.</p>\n<p>At the local level, the best work has almost certainly been done by The City, with its Meet Your Mayor. This was a weekly set of issue guides, structured as a quiz that enabled voters to choose the candidate whose views most closely matched their own. Elsewhere, here is a great guide to campaign coverage overall from the Texas Tribune, as well as two recent examples of other offerings from them: A guide to the state’s March 2022 primary ballots, and a look-up tool for checking on your representatives after redistricting.</p>\n<p>Here’s a reminder from Injustice Watch that guides can particularly help voters with races for more obscure offices, including local judges. And here’s another overall guide to coverage, from another smaller organization, the Chatham [North Carolina] News-Record.</p>\n<p>These more recent efforts draw on previous ones from around the country, notably the Human Voter Guide from KPCC Los Angeles in 2017, and the ChiVote consortium in Chicago in 2019, which included 10 news organizations coordinated by the Better Government Association.</p>\n<p>Another time-honored technique, fact-checking, was the focus of a clever initiative by WLPN, Nashville’s public radio station. It combed through almost the entirety of the major mayoral candidates’ websites and then effectively updated the work throughout the new mayor’s first year in office, comparing governing results with website promises.</p>\nBeyond text and graphics\n<p>There have been a number of successes — at least in terms of garnering audience and driving conversations — in the use of new forms of media in and around elections. </p>\n<p>In Cleveland, Ideastream (public media) launched an 18-episode podcast called After Jackson on the race to succeed four-term incumbent Mayor Frank Jackson. Most installments were 30 minutes long. Perhaps ironically, while the medium was unusual for current elections reporting, the substantive coverage, deep and nuanced, was highly traditional in its focus on candidates and issues, with a great deal of attention to the horserace. But the enduring value of this approach is that it capitalizes on the notion of the campaign as an evolving narrative — a very familiar approach for political reporters — and naturally translates this to podcasting.</p>\n<p>After local controversies surrounding coverage of protests in Pittsburgh following the murder of George Floyd, local political reporter Alexis Johnson left the Post-Gazette newspaper and produced a documentary on the mayoral campaign for Vice, her new employer.</p>\n<p>Newsletters are another key engagement tool. A number were deployed for the 2020 campaign, including Mass. Election Prep from WBUR, a seven-day series of on-demand newsletters, as well as ProPublica’s User’s Guide to Democracy series. Both offerings were made available in both English and Spanish.</p>\n<p>Finally, another product from Pittsburgh — not strictly tied to campaigns or elections per se — is worth spotlighting: an online course on the history of the city, “Know Pittsburgh. For Real,” produced by PublicSource. The learning is delivered in a series of a dozen emails. Knowledge of local history is almost surely a way of deepening ties to community, and initiatives like this one seem promising for enhancing civic engagement generally, perhaps particularly among new arrivals and younger voters. It would likely make sense to enable text delivery as well as email.</p>\nWhat happens after “community listening”?\n<p>There have been a number of efforts in recent years to shape coverage of mayoral and other campaigns in light of the results of “community listening” about the genuine concerns of voters. I am concerned, however, that the listening seems in a number of cases to have outweighed efforts afterward to re-shape coverage.</p>\n<p>One exception of effective (even if limited) coverage as a result of community listening came from Canopy Atlanta in last year’s mayoral campaign there. It seems especially noteworthy because the focus of the listening was in historically underserved communities. Canopy secured the responses of both runoff candidates to five questions in which these neighborhoods said they were particularly interested.</p>\nThinking about politics more like a political operative\n<p>Jim Friedlich, executive director and CEO of Lenfest, recently recommended that news organizations “pivot funding and revenue messaging from ‘saving journalism’ to ‘supporting democracy.’ If that is so, one possible approach — while not expressly yet a part of any major news organization’s playbook for engaging campaign coverage — might be structuring engagement efforts more nearly in line with how political operatives think about getting out the vote. (There are clear analogies also to how community organizers, going back to Saul Alinsky, think about their work.)</p>\n<p>Modern engagement journalism has its own roots in the digital campaign innovations of the presidential campaigns of Howard Dean in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2008. Newsrooms should look again at what channels well-run campaigns use for communication today. Texting, for instance, is increasingly important, albeit expensive, but also crucial are analysis of internet searches as indicative of public concerns, leafleting, in-person public meetings, and even something of a renaissance in door-knocking. In short, if an important objective of our journalism is to involve more people, and a more diverse group of them, in campaigns, there may be more to learn from those who do this as the heart of their own jobs.</p>\n<p></p><p>Richard Tofel was founding general manager (and first employee) of ProPublica, and was its president from 2013 until January 2022.

        "description": "<p>This summer, CNN’s new CEO, Chris Licht, wrote in a note to employees: “We are truth-tellers, focused on informing, not alarming our viewers.” Since he came on board in May, Licht has spoken about the importance of “objectivity” at the network. In August, he ended “Reliable Sources with Brian Stelter,” laying off Stelter and his production staff. Stelter was the “closest thing to a CNN ombudsman there was,” S. Mitra Kalita tweeted.</p>\n<p>Licht acknowledged to CNN staffers that some of them might find Stelter’s firing “unsettling” and told them, “There will be more changes and you might not understand it or like it all.” On Friday, another change rolled out: CNN is revamping its morning show, in what Licht called a “mass appeal play.”</p>\n<p>Can this work? Justin Peters in Slate last month:</p>\n<p>For decades, CNN stood for objective, down-the-middle news reporting in the mind of the American media consumer. The network’s pioneering coverage of the Gulf War lent it a certain stature, and it quickly grew a reputation for neutral, credible reporting, becoming uniquely authoritative in the American media sphere. With Reliable Sources, the network aimed to leverage its reportorial credibility into honest, authoritative criticism and analysis of the rest of the media. If you trusted the network’s reporting on the nation and the world, then why wouldn’t you trust its reporting on the media?</p>\n<p>The flaw here is that over the past several years, more and more people have come to distrust CNN’s reporting and analysis — a phenomenon that is at least partially attributable to the continuous attacks Donald Trump and his allies have launched at the network in order to blunt the impact of its reporting on and analysis of his incompetent, dishonest presidency.</p>\n<p>A new report from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism on how 18- to 30-year-olds engage with news refers to the paradox that CNN and other mainstream media outlets face now:</p>\n<p>A suspicious, skeptical approach to information [means] news brands are judged by, but not inherently valued for, their impartiality — except in times of crisis, when their professionalism, reach, and resources come into their own…</p>\n<p>Mainstream media therefore finds itself in a paradoxical position. It is judged more harshly than other types of news media, because it is held to a higher (impossible?) standard. It is expected to be impartial, objective, and cold-blooded by a group of people who seriously question whether that can ever be truly achieved and who don’t always value the tonal execution of impartial, objective, cold-blooded news.</p>\n<p>The report builds on research published by Reuters earlier this year. Its authors spoke with 72 people ages 18-30 in the U.S., U.K., and Brazil. (In each country, a third of the people were ages 18 to 21, a third ages 22 to 24, and a third ages 25 to 30.) Some of their responses highlight the uphill battle that CNN may face as it shifts.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the time, mainstream news can be very biased or politically-motivated. This makes it hard to decipher its credibility,” one 28-year-old in the U.S. said. “In turn, I oftentimes have to spend additional time seeking out information and facts.”</p>\n<p>That attitude is common. “One of the great commonalities in this study is that almost all young people believe that all information is put in the public realm for a reason, and is not to be trusted or taken at face value,” the authors write, adding, “They are highly skeptical of most information, to greater or lesser degrees — they don’t necessarily judge a source’s value by its impartiality.” They identify three types of skepticism:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can read the full report here.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Tech news site The Verge debuted a radically redesigned website this week. One of the first things editor-in-chief Nilay Patel remembers telling the designers when they started the process back in 2020? “We just want to be able to tweet onto our own website.”</p>\n<p>“Dieter [Bohn, former executive editor of The Verge] and I were routinely frustrated that we weren’t on our own homepage enough. We’re both busy. We were running the site, we’re making podcasts, we were off shooting videos,” Patel explained in an episode of The Vergecast. “The barrier to entry to our own homepage was a 500-word article. It was too high. We weren’t publishing enough and we were driving ourselves crazy — and we found ourselves using Twitter, which is someone else’s platform.”</p>\n<p>He added, “I’m looking at the gigantic website we run and saying, ‘Why am I finding it easier to publish on someone else’s platform instead of my own?'”</p>\n<p>The Verge was founded in 2011, making the Vox-owned publication something of an elder among tech news sites. The site launched with an adventurous homepage design and has made bold overhauls in the years since, but the redesign debuted on Tuesday “represents the biggest reinvention of The Verge since we started the whole thing,” Patel said.</p>\n<p>The most consequential change isn’t the new typefaces or color palette (featuring “Blurple,” “Pernod,” and “Hot Brick”), but transforming The Verge’s homepage into what the site is calling the Storystream. Vox Media has played with the phrase StoryStream — and the idea of giving its journalists an outlet to post short content — in the past, but that was typically to group similar stories together from its own content. This Storystream pulls together full Verge articles with original reporting, tweets, external links (to press releases and other news orgs), YouTube links, quick voicey blurbs, TikToks, and more into one newsy feed.</p>\n\n<p>Mentioned this in the post but @backlon and I really did make one of the first prototypes of our feed in Google Docs last year. We just had fun blogging into a doc for most of an afternoon, to figure out what we needed.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you have to just start, somewhere. Anywhere. pic.twitter.com/gKrZdPpW00</p>\n<p>— nilay patel (@reckless) September 13, 2022</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Six years ago, The Verge had revamped the site to create distinctive design elements — think: neon pink pull quotes and “laser lines” in videos — so that the site’s content would be recognizable even “as the media unbundled itself into article pages individually distributed by social media and search algorithms,” Patel wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“But,” Patel continued, “publishing across other people’s platforms can only take you so far. And the more we lived with that decision, the more we felt strongly that our own platform should be an antidote to algorithmic news feeds, an editorial product made by actual people with intent and expertise.”</p>\n<p>The new site looks a lot more like Twitter than a front page. And that’s kind of the point. Patel has said The Verge’s competition is not Wired or The New York Times but Twitter “and other aggregators of audience.” As other news outlets shift resources toward building communities where readers are already spending lots of time — YouTube, Reddit, TikTok, Instagram, Discord, etc. — The Verge wanted to be sure it was investing closer to home, too. Ultimately, the “big hope” is that The Verge homepage reads like “a better, cooler, funner feed than social media feeds.”</p>\n<p>The redesign was built first for mobile — 90% of The Verge’s audience visits on their phones — and the team has acknowledged the desktop version is something of an afterthought. With the addition of several widgets, the reading experience can be a bit chaotic and some are questioning how accessible the new site is. Others really hate the white-on-black text, which many people find hard to read.</p>\n<p>The idea, though, is to bring the most important and interesting tech news — including the many conversations, reporting, and bite-sized tidbits found elsewhere on the internet — to one place. As Patel explained in the post:</p>\n<p>Our plan is to bring the best of old-school blogging to a modern news feed experience and to have our editors and senior reporters constantly updating the site with the best of tech and science news from around the entire internet. If that means linking out to Wired or Bloomberg or some other news source, that’s great — we’re happy to send people to excellent work elsewhere, and we trust that our feed will be useful enough to have you come back later. If that means we just need to embed the viral TikTok or wacky CEO tweet and move on, so be it — we can do that. We can embed anything, actually: I’m particularly excited that we can directly point people to interesting threads on Reddit and other forums.</p>\n<p>The Storystream also appears at the end of article pages, though it’s unclear how often readers will reach it there. (After article text, readers are confronted with a large ad, a link to the comments section, a “featured video” ad, related links section, another large ad, a sponsored content banner, and then the Storystream.) Overall, the redesign is a major investment in The Verge’s homepage, already the single most popular page at Vox Media, said publisher Helen Havlak.</p>\n<p>“With the new site, we are making a big bet that we can grow our direct, loyal audience by curating the best tech and science destination on the web,” Havlak said. She also told Axios, “If I can just get people…to refresh our site one more time a day, that is a huge lift to my business.”</p>\n<p>The new format will free up editorial bandwidth by eliminating aggregation posts and debates over whether “one dude’s tweets” deserve an entire story, Patel said. He estimated the changes will save the newsroom 20 hours per day and said the extra time will be redirected toward publishing more original reporting and analysis.</p>\n\n<p>About a dozen times a day, the Verge newsroom will vet a story that doesn’t quite hit our bar for a full news post. In the past that was the end of it, but what’s fun with the new site is that we can now cover them in super short Quick Posts (aka “Quipis”) https://t.co/3OM2WGyeWw</p>\n<p>— jon.porter (@JonPorty) September 14, 2022</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Verge also announced that it’s moving to the commenting platform Coral, with the intention of fostering more quality conversations on its site. (The Verge was one of many news outlets that turned off comments on some or all articles in recent years.) Under the new protocol, chief of moderation Eric Berggren will oversee community contributions, though any Verge reporter can choose to “feature” a worthwhile comment.</p>\n<p>“We also hope to spotlight our best comments in the new Storystream newsfeed on our homepage and create a positive feedback loop that way,” publisher Havlak added.</p>\n<p>On the Vergecast episode, Patel also revealed a somewhat unusual goal for a news organization: how much traffic it can send to other outlets. He said he thinks The Verge can “very quickly” send publishers more traffic than Twitter, for example.</p>\n<p>“One of my biggest goals — the big number that I’m looking at — is how much traffic we send out. I think we will be a huge success if we are sending a meaningful amount of traffic to other people,” Patel said. “Because that relationship between publishers and platforms has gotten totally out of whack.”</p>\n<p>“If we can just get back in the game where we’re like, hey, you can build your own communities, on your own platforms, once again, in a format that feels both very modern — because it’s a news feed — but inherits the best parts of what people loved about blogging, and you’re a good citizen of the internet because you’re sharing the wealth,” Patel added, “I think that lets you reset that whole relationship and then potentially build whatever the next things are, without constantly scrambling against whatever algorithm update, whatever a platform is going to roll out to up- or down-rank content.”</p>\n<p>(Some of you will want to listen to the second half of the episode, where editor-at-large David Pierce goes nitty gritty on the site redesign with senior product manager Tara Kalmanson and senior engineer Matt Crider. They discuss why TikTok embeds are so terrible and how they balanced speed, content, and design in the redesign.)</p>\n<p>The Verge said the typical number of visitors to its homepage doubled on the day the redesign debuted. Here’s what some of those visitors thought:</p>\n\n<p>My general rule is to be skeptical of tech site redesigns. Most of the time they are born out of a need for better page view and engagement metrics.</p>\n<p>The Verge’s redesign is more of a business model shift with an accompanying (rough) redesign. pic.twitter.com/imQiZGrewy</p>\n<p>— Neil Cybart (@neilcybart) September 13, 2022</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Check out the storystream on this site.

        "description": "<p>Obituaries have long been a reliable revenue stream for newspapers both in print and online. But at the news site Richland Source in Ohio, senior ad and marketing manager David Yoder and director of client coaching and strategy Audrey Longstreth wanted to fix the publication’s obituary section.</p>\n<p>Richland Source had been charging $50 per obituary, which is relatively low (costs at larger papers rise into the hundreds of dollars). The obituaries section was one of the most-visited parts of the website, and, in 2021, it brought in over $12,000. But platform director Zac Hiser didn’t want to charge more. He had heard from readers that payment was a hurdle. And so instead of optimizing for revenue, Hiser, Yoder, and Longstreth — who all grew up and went to high school in the area — decided to make obituaries free to publish.</p>\n<p>“Effective Aug. 1, funeral homes and readers alike will be able to directly publish an obituary to Richland Source, Ashland Source, and Knox Pages for free using a short web form,” Source told readers in an announcement in July. “Changes in the local media landscape in recent years have resulted in a clear message from local readers: They want a convenient and inviting space where they can find all the recent obituaries.”</p>\n<p>Source Media includes the Richland Source, Ashland Source, and Knox Pages, which cover their respective counties in northern central Ohio. They all receive funding through a mixture of individual and corporate memberships, advertising, in-house marketing, and grants. (The Richland Source also developed LedeAI, a system to automate high school sports stories.)</p>\n<p>The reaction to making obituaries free was immediate and positive, Yoder said. The post on Facebook, for example, had 178 reactions and 25 shares (Richland Source’s Facebook page has a total of 34,000 likes). Yoder believes that in rural communities like Richland County — where 20% of the population is 65 or older — people want to know what’s going on in other people’s lives and to be able to support each other.</p>\n<p>“The payoff of this work is when we do it right,” Yoder said. “When somebody writes a thoughtful obituary, it’s a reminder that our publication is a platform for people to grieve in a healthy way, and to say something meaningful to the larger community about somebody they love very much.”</p>\n<p>On the website, one reader wrote:</p>\n<p>“Thank you!! This is so much more than a small gesture. This says that your readers and the communities in which you serve, DO matter to you. When grieving the loss of a loved one, the last thing someone wants to do is worry about the cost of a public announcement. Unfortunately, I have first hand experience and we chose not to spend thousands of dollars to publish in the news sources in the larger cities, where he once lived. I felt bad that we couldn’t possibly reach more people, but we could not justify the expense for just a picture and one sentence. So, from the bottom of my heart, I thank you for making life a little easier, for those going through a very difficult time.”</p>\n<p>Yoder said Richland Source published 38 obituaries. That number jumped to 105 in August when publishing them became free. Knox Pages, which is for a smaller county and is a newer publication, published eight obituaries in July and 22 in August. Ashland Source published five in July and three in August.</p>\n<p>Because the new obituaries system now publishes automatically, the staffer who previously worked on obits daily can now check in and make updates or corrections as needed and move on to other tasks. So far, no major issues have come up. (“The risk of auto-publish is something we’re willing to live with,” Yoder said.)</p>\n<p>There was also a 40% increase in pageviews of the obituaries pages across the three properties, Yoder said, boosting overall traffic while freeing up an employee’s schedule.</p>\n<p>It’s too soon to say, though, whether free obituaries and the resulting traffic have led to an uptick in memberships on the site. The three publications have a total of 1,185 paying members. Around 45% of those pay $70 a year, the lowest tier (the highest is $1,000 per year).</p>\n<p>Yoder said the sites plan to add include direct membership asks in the obituaries sections to encourage people to support the publications. For now, though, he’s glad to see that people have responded to the change.</p>\n<p>“Paying to place obituaries is a proven revenue model,” Yoder said. “We gave up very real dollars…The faucet turned off and the revenue ceased from that particular line. But 30 days later, when we see 40% growth [in obituary pageviews], we believe our hunch is proving correct.”</p>\n<p></p> Photo by CA Creative on Unsplash <p></p>",

        "link": "https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/09/when-tragedy-becomes-banal-why-news-consumers-experience-crisis-fatigue/",
        "description": "<p>When Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine by land, air and sea on Feb. 24, 2022, the images of war were conveyed to dismayed onlookers around the world. Far from the action, many of us became aware of the unprovoked aggression by reading online coverage or watching TV to see explosions and people running from danger and crowding into underground bunkers. </p>\n<p>Half a year later, the violence continues. But for those who have not been directly affected by the events, this ongoing war and its casualties have been shifting to the periphery of many people’s attention. </p>\n<p>This turning away makes sense. </p>\n<p>Being attentive to realities like war is often painful, and people are not well-equipped to keep a sustained focus on ongoing or traumatic occurrences. </p>\n<p>In addition, since the war in Ukraine began, many other events have arisen to occupy the world’s attention. These include droughts, wildfires, storms tied to global warming, mass shootings and the reversal of Roe v. Wade. </p>\n<p>As the philosopher-psychologist William James asked, “Does not every sudden shock, appearance of a new object, or change in a sensation, create a real interruption?”</p>\n<p>Ongoing tragic events, like the assault on Ukraine, can recede from people’s attention because many may feel overwhelmed, helpless or drawn to other urgent issues. This phenomenon is called “crisis fatigue.” </p>\nRoots of crisis fatigue\n<p>Malevolent actors and authoritarians like Putin are aware of public fatigue and use it to their advantage. “War fatigue is kicking in,” the Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said. “Russia is playing on us getting tired. We must not fall into the trap.” </p>\n<p>In a speech to marketing professionals in Cannes, France, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, asked them to keep the world focused on his country’s plight. “I’ll be honest with you — the end of this war and its circumstances depend on the world’s attention…,” he said. “Don’t let the world switch to something else!” </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, many of us have already changed the channel. The tragic has become banal. </p>\n<p>I became interested in the phenomenon of fatigue as a result of my scholarly research into moral attentiveness. This idea was articulated by the 20th-century French philosopher and social activist Simone Weil. </p>\n<p>According to Weil, moral attention is the capacity to open ourselves up fully — intellectually, emotionally and even physically — to the realities that we encounter. She described such attention as vigilance, a suspension of our ego-driven frameworks and personal desires in favor of a Buddhist-like emptiness of mind. This mindset receives, raw and unfiltered, whatever is presented without avoidance or projection. </p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, Weil found attention to be inseparable from compassion, or “suffering with” the other. There is no avoiding pain and anguish when one attends to the afflicted; hence, she wrote that “thought flies from affliction as promptly and irresistibly as an animal flies from death.” </p>\n<p>The sensitivity involved in attending to crises can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, attention can put people in touch with the unvarnished lives of others so the afflicted are truly seen and heard. On the other, such openness can overwhelm many of us through vicarious trauma, as psychologists Lisa McCann and Laurie Pearlman have noted. </p>\n<p>The difficulty of sustained focus on events like the war is due not only to the inherent fragility of moral attention, however. As cultural critics like Neil Postman, James Williams and Maggie Jackson have noted, the 24/7 news cycle is one of many pressures clamoring for our attention. Our smartphones and other technology with incessant communications — from trivial to apocalyptic — engineer environments to keep us perpetually distracted and disoriented.</p>\nWhy audiences tune out\n<p>Aside from the threats to people’s attention posed by our distracting technologies and information overload, there is also the fact of crisis fatigue leading readers to consume less news. </p>\n<p>This year, a Reuters Institute analysis showed that interest in news has decreased sharply across all markets, from 63% in 2017 to 51% in 2022, while a full 15% of Americans have disconnected from news coverage altogether. </p>\n<p>According to the Reuters report, the reasons for this differ, in part, with political affiliation. Conservative voters tend to avoid the news because they deem it untrustworthy or biased, while liberal voters avoid news because of feelings of powerlessness and fatigue. Online news, with its perpetual drive to keep eyes trained on screens, is unwittingly undermining its own goals: to provide news and keep the public informed.</p>\nTaking a new tack\n<p>How might we recover a capacity for meaningful attention and responses amid incessant, disjointed and overwhelming news? Scholars have made a variety of recommendations, usually focused on reining in digital device usage. Beyond this, readers and journalists might consider the following:</p>\n\nLimiting the daily intake of news can help people become more attentive to particular issues of concern without feeling overwhelmed. Cultural theorist Yves Citton, in his book The Ecology of Attention, urges readers to “extract” themselves “from the hold of the alertness media regime.” According to him, the current media creates a state of “permanent alertness” through “crisis discourses, images of catastrophes, political scandals, and violent news items.” At the same time, reading long-form articles and essays can actually be a practice that helps with cultivating attentiveness. \nJournalists can include more solutions-based stories that capture the possibility of change. Avenues for action can be offered to readers to counteract paralysis in the face of tragedy. Amanda Ripley, a former Time magazine journalist, notes that “stories that offer hope, agency, and dignity feel like breaking news right now, because we are so overwhelmed with the opposite.” \n\n<p>Weil, who was committed to the responsibility of moral attentiveness but did not romanticize tragedy, wrote, “Nothing is so beautiful and wonderful, nothing is so continually fresh and surprising, so full of sweet and perpetual ecstasy, as the good.”</p>\n<p></p><p>Rebecca Rozelle-Stone is a professor of philosophy at the University of North Dakota.

        "description": "<p>The budget passed in California this week includes $25 million worth of help for local news, which will be distributed via UC Berkeley’s Graduate School of Journalism starting next year.</p>\n<p>This isn’t the first time that a state has budgeted money to help local journalism — New Jersey’s Civic Information Consortium gets $3 million from the state’s latest budget, for instance — but the amount in California is especially large:</p>\n<p>What is believed to be the largest state allocation ever made in California and in the U.S. to support local journalism, the new Berkeley fellowship program will award up to 40 fellows per year for at least three years with a $50,000 annual stipend to supplement their salaries while they work in California newsrooms covering communities in dire need of strong local journalism. </p>\n<p>The fellowships will last three years. Berkeley Journalism students and graduates, and graduates of other programs elsewhere, will be able to apply for the first fellowship cohort as early as May 2023. Chancellor Carol Christ said the fellowship program reflects the campus’s values and priorities, and demonstrates the innovative leader that Berkeley Journalism has become in higher education.</p>\n<p>When fellows are chosen, a “particular focus will be put on newsrooms that provide local coverage for underserved and historically underrepresented communities,” UC Berkeley said. The university is currently working to recruit a project director and organize an advisory committee “that reflects the diversity of the state of California, and that also brings others experiences, expertise, and perspectives to the table,” Steve Katz, assistant dean of advancement at the journalism school, told me in an email.</p>",

        "link": "https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/09/doxxed-threatened-and-arrested-russias-war-on-wikipedia-editors/",
        "description": "<p>One Friday in March, not long after Russia invaded Ukraine, Mikhail, a Russia-based Wikipedia editor, opened the Telegram app to discover that he had been doxxed. His personal information, including his name and social media accounts, had been posted in a channel run by a group of Russian online vigilantes targeting Wikipedians writing about the war. Below the text was an image with a single word: “Retribution.” The post had been viewed more than 110,000 times.</p>\n<p>Soon after, Mikhail, who was granted anonymity for this story for his safety, started receiving threats on social media.</p>\n<p>“I began to act more cautiously,” he said. “I closed off the social networks from outsiders and became even more careful to monitor [Wikipedia] edits that could be linked to my name and brought up as [legal] violations.”</p>\n<p>That month, at least four other Wikipedia editors were also doxxed, and accused of smearing Russia’s war efforts, by the group, which called itself Mrakoborec — a reference to the Aurors, or wizarding police, in Harry Potter. Among them was Mark Bernstein, an editor based in Belarus, Russia’s ally in the war in Ukraine. After Bernstein’s name appeared in the Mrakoborec group on March 10, he was arrested, and detained in Minsk’s notorious Okrestina detention center. In June, he received a sentence of three years of restricted freedom for “organizing and preparing activities that disrupt social order.”</p>\n<p>“Before this event, nothing like this ever happened in the Russian [Wikipedia] community,” Sergey Leschina, another Russian Wikipedia editor, said. Like many other editors, Leschina left Russia after the war started. He now lives in Lithuania, and says many editors are hesitant to work on pages about the war. “I think almost everybody who edits from Russia or Belarus does it with different accounts,” he said.</p>\n<p>Bernstein’s arrest and the threats to individual Wikipedia editors are part of a broader campaign to stifle the platform as the Russian government pushes a pro-war propaganda drive, including banning Western social media platforms and cracking down on independent reporting. Although local media has linked the Mrakoborec group to the Russian government, observers say that the connection is difficult to prove, as groups such as these are created to provide the government with plausible deniability.</p>\n<p>The organization that runs Wikipedia has also found itself targeted by Russia’s propaganda drive. In March, Russia passed a law that criminalized the publishing of any information about the military that the state considers to be false information. Under the new law, a Russian court fined the Wikimedia Foundation, which owns Wikipedia, 5 million rubles (USD $88,000) for failing to remove what a Russian court claimed was disinformation about the war in Ukraine. The organization launched an appeal in June.</p>\n<p>“I am quite sad to see how the idea of the free flow of information, which has always been at the core of Wikipedia, is being suppressed in my home country with all its might, giving way to government censorship,” said Mikhail, who continues to work on Wikipedia from an anonymous account.</p>\n<p>Wikipedia, which has more than 1,800 Russian-speaking volunteer editors, has long been a thorn in the Russian government’s side. The country blocked the site in 2015, over a page about drugs, but quickly reversed its decision. “It is fortunate that Wikipedia is too serious a player to be so easily blocked, as Facebook, Instagram, and all kinds of opposition sites have already been blocked,” Mikhail said.</p>\n<p>Since February, Wikipedia editors have regularly updated content on the Ukraine war in Russian, including articles such as “2022 Invasion of Ukraine,” which is viewed more than 40,000 times daily on average. Anton Protsiuk, programs coordinator at Wikimedia Ukraine, said that the Russian authorities have been fairly unsuccessful in promoting their point of view on Wikipedia, and that Russian-language Wikipedia has been largely neutral in terms of describing the war.</p>\n<p>In March, Russian communications agency Roskomnadzor threatened to block the site over the article describing the invasion of Ukraine, leading to mass downloads of offline copies of the encyclopedia. The agency ordered Wikipedia to remove several articles on the Ukrainian war. Wikipedia did not comply. Meanwhile, local officials trashed the encyclopedia as a “weapon of informational war.” In July, Roskomnadzor ordered Russian search engines to start marking Wikipedia as being in violation of Russian laws on search result pages.</p>\n<p>Russian media has also targeted Wikipedia with accusations of hosting child pornography material over what the unofficial local Wikipedia group describes as pictures of anime girls.</p>\n<p>“This is an old smear tactic,” Victoria Doronina, a member of the Wikimedia Foundation’s board of trustees and a molecular biologist originally from Belarus, said.</p>\n<p>As an organization based in San Francisco that adheres to U.S. laws, the Wikimedia Foundation has been able to fend off Russian authorities’ requests to remove content. But, as it has with Google, Twitter, and other Western tech companies, Russia has demanded that the Wikimedia Foundation open an official representative office that would be liable to Russian law — including official requests for censorship. While some companies have taken steps towards complying with the local hiring law, sometimes referred to as a “hostage-taking law,” other online platforms have been reluctant as it opens up risks that authorities may arrest local staff or request user data.</p>\n<p>“The Russian government would like to have all the information so it can punish Wikipedia editors and maybe even the readers,” said Doronina.</p>\n<p>Going after the editors may be another way that the Russian state is trying to exert control over Wikipedia. In 2021, an investigation by Russian media outlet Daily Storm linked the Mrakoborec Telegram group with Russia’s notorious troll factories connected to the Internet Research Agency, the online influence organization accused of interfering with the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. Proving a direct connection with the government, however, is tricky, said Roman Osadchuk, a research associate in the digital forensics research lab at Washington-based think tank Atlantic Council.</p>\n<p>But, regardless of who is behind the group, “the whole reason for [Mrakoborec]’s existence is to silence voices that are in contrast with the Russian state’s position,” said Osadchuk. He said that Mrakoborec has been trying to stifle narratives contradicting the Russian state’s position by unfairly flagging news on Russian atrocities in Ukraine that appears on social media platforms. The tactic is less effective on Wikipedia, where the platform’s community plays a greater role in editing articles. As a result, Osadchuk said, Mrakoborec is turning to doxxing.</p>\n<p>Telegram shut down the original Mrakoborec group in March, but the group has reappeared on the platform under a different account.</p>\n<p>Mrakoborec claimed in a Telegram post that it has collected information on more than 1,000 Wikipedia editors who have participated in editing articles on the war in Ukraine. Doronina of the Wikimedia Foundation’s board of trustees said that Russia’s state agencies could target one of those editors any day. “You cannot predict who is going to attack. It’s not a bear, it’s a pack of bears,” she said.</p>\n<p>Not all Russian Wikipedia editors are under threat of the crackdowns. The local Wikimedia organization includes members with diametrically opposed views on the war, with some supporting the country’s president, Vladimir Putin. This has made discussing the war like “walking in a minefield,” another Russian editor, Konstantin, said. Konstantin, who asked that his name be changed for his safety, said, “Any careless word spoken publicly can lead to real reprisals.”</p>\n<p>Konstantin said that many editors in Russia are now participating in Wikipedia less, with some having quit the project altogether. As a result, he is concerned that the neutrality of Wikipedia’s coverage of the war in Ukraine may suffer, with articles on the topic left to Russian-speaking editors who either live beyond the reach of Russian and Belarusian authorities, or who support Russia’s war effort.</p>\n<p>The editors who remain are still trying to do what they can, said Konstantin, but he characterized their efforts as resembling those of an orchestra playing on a sinking Titanic.</p>\n<p>“Our aim is to create an encyclopedia which is as neutral and comprehensive as possible, and as accessible to all as possible. And, in this sense, Russian Wikipedians do not differ from, say, Polish, Croatian, American, English — or Ukrainian [Wikipedians],” he said. “Despite the fact that our countries have entered into such a tragic interaction, this allows us to still do something together on this platform.”</p>\n<p></p><p>Masha Borak is a journalist covering the intersection of technology with politics, business, and society.

        "description": "<p>Semafor won’t launch until October but we’re getting a clearer picture of what the news startup with global ambitions has planned.</p>\n<p>The media company hosted the second forum in a series on “the future of news” sponsored by the Knight Foundation on Wednesday morning. (The first event featured, among others, Tucker Carlson.)</p>\n<p>Justin Smith and his fellow co-founder Ben Smith — no relation, though there’s jokes about getting a 23andMe test to confirm — were joined by Semafor executive editor Gina Chua, The Washington Post’s investigative political reporter Josh Dawsey, AP White House reporter Seung Min Kim, and others who report from Washington, D.C. About an hour into the event, 25 people were viewing the Twitter live feed and another 80 were streaming via YouTube. A few hours after the event concluded, the total number of viewers had climbed to nearly 2,000.</p>\n<p>There were panels on the 2024 elections, an “offshore view” of U.S. politics, and covering Congress after the violence of January 6th. And about halfway through the schedule, Justin Smith gave a pretty straightforward pitch about the “meaning and purpose of Semafor.”</p>\n<p>As CEO of Bloomberg Media, Smith said he became obsessed with the “precipitous decline in trust levels across the global news industry” and “the lack of innovation being directed at solving this existential crisis.”</p>\n<p>His assessment of the situation is “relatively simple,” he explained:</p>\n<p>Intelligent news consumers, if you just stop and listen, are unhappy and are screaming from the rooftops. They’re overwhelmed by too much news and too many sources. They no longer know which sources to trust, if any, but at the same time they feel a deep responsibility to be extremely well-informed and, in fact, are searching for ways to make sense of the second-by-second blizzard of news and commentary that we’re all experiencing every day.</p>\n<p>Each of us has been there, I’m sure, as news consumers in 2022. You read the latest piece about the Ukraine war in a major U.S. publication. You think you understand, but then you start to wonder — who’s this journalist and what’s their background? What’s their story? What’s the European or the Russian perspective? Am I only getting the view from the U.S. liberal establishment? And then, of course, you plunge into Twitter or onto the web, to spend 10 to 15 minutes that you definitely don’t have, trying to triangulate the news. This pattern repeats itself over and over and over again, on international as well as domestic issues. The Mar-a-Lago classified documents scandal, the Inflation Reduction Act, China’s zero Covid policy, rinse and repeat.</p>\n<p>Smith said Semafor would be a global news organization dedicated to solving these frustrations for news consumers. How? Their efforts will include “reimagining” the traditional article form to distinguish facts from opinion and including “curation and distillation” of outside sources on its news site.</p>\n<p>Here’s how Smith tried to sum up Semafor in one (albeit lengthy) sentence.</p>\n<p>What we’re gonna bring to you in just a couple of weeks this fall is a global news brand dedicated to helping you manage this complexity through, on the one hand, quality original news from leading trusted journalists presented in new, more transparent article forms alongside intelligent, comprehensive curation of other sources across the ideological and geographic spectrums resulting in more profound, deeper insight in less time.</p>\n<p>Whew!</p>\n<p>Here’s a couple of other things that stood out:</p>\n<p>Semafor isn’t ready to give up “bothsidesism”</p>\n<p>Pew Research Center has found journalists have different views on “bothsidesism” than the general public. A conversation between co-founder and editor-in-chief Ben Smith and Mehdi Hasan, a host at MSNBC, showed reporters have different ideas about presenting “both sides” to every issue.</p>\n<p>“There are two words we need to remove from our media vocabulary right now and that is ‘both sides,'” Hasan said. He said the idea could be “lazy” and, at worst, “deeply dangerous,” before adding: “There are a bunch of major issues on which there are not both sides. There are not both sides on climate change. There are not both sides on white supremacy. There are not both sides on democracy. There are not both sides on the Holocaust.”</p>\n<p>Smith agreed the example from Southlake, Texas was “offensive and stupid.”</p>\n<p>“But,” he added, “I think that there’s also a lot of pressure on us to say ‘there are not both sides’ at all times. You saw all last summer people saying there aren’t both sides on whether Joe Manchin is a corrupt fool.”</p>\n<p>Becoming less U.S.-centric could be an uphill battle</p>\n<p>“News that can deliver global perspective and viewpoints is pretty crucial to our mission at Semafor,” said Meera Pattni, head of communications for Semafor. “That means news that doesn’t ask, ‘What does this all mean for America?’ at the end of every story. I’m calling this panel the geopolitical reality check that no one asked for on a Wednesday morning.”</p>\n<p>Still, much of the “offshore view” panel focused on how Americans perceive news media, whether Americans are interested in news from other countries, how the U.S. is perceived overseas, etc.</p>\n<p>At one point, Yinka Adegoke, Semafor’s Africa editor, said “I want to touch on something that [fellow panelist, Pablo Pardo, the U.S. bureau chief of El Mundo] said about Americans having very little interest in Europe.” He laughed, “I think Americans have almost no interest in Africa.”</p>\n<p>Semafor editor-at-large Steve Clemons jumped in, “We’re depending on you to change that.”</p>\n<p>Adegoke added, “I do think it’s changing. Americans have been told this story of poverty, war, all these cliches you’ve heard for so long, that’s actually not interesting to them anymore. They want to hear different stories.”</p>\n<p>You can watch the full event here.</p>",

        "description": "<p>As statewide primaries continue through the summer, many Americans are beginning to think about which candidates they will support in the 2022 general election.  This decision-making process is fraught with difficulties, especially for inexperienced voters. </p>\n<p>Voters must navigate angry, emotion-laden conversations about politics when trying to sort out whom to vote for. Americans are more likely than ever to view politics in moral terms, meaning their political conversations sometimes feel like epic battles between good and evil.</p>\n<p>But political conversations are also shaped by, obviously, what Americans know — and, less obviously, what they think they know — about politics. </p>\n<p>In recent research, I studied how Americans’ perceptions of their own political knowledge shape their political attitudes. My results show that many Americans think they know much more about politics than they really do.</p>\nKnowledge deficit, confidence surplus\n<p>Over the past five years, I have studied the phenomenon of what I call “political overconfidence.” My work, in tandem with other researchers’ studies, reveals the ways it thwarts democratic politics.</p>\n<p>Political overconfidence can make people more defensive of factually wrong beliefs about politics. It also causes Americans to underestimate the political skill of their peers. And those who believe themselves to be political experts often dismiss the guidance of real experts.</p>\n<p>Political overconfidence also interacts with political partisanship, making partisans less willing to listen to peers across the aisle. </p>\n<p>The result is a breakdown in the ability to learn from one another about political issues and events.</p>\n<p>In my most recent study on the subject, I tried to find out what would happen when politically overconfident people found out they were mistaken about political facts. </p>\n<p>To do this, I recruited a sample of Americans to participate in a survey experiment via the Lucid recruitment platform. In the experiment, some respondents were shown a series of statements that taught them to avoid common political falsehoods. For instance, one statement explained that while many people believe that Social Security will soon run out of money, the reality is less dire than it seems.</p>\n<p>My hypothesis was that most people would learn from the statements, and become more wary of repeating common political falsehoods. However, as I have found in my previous studies, a problem quickly emerged. </p>\n<p>First, I asked respondents a series of basic questions about American politics. This quiz included topics like which party controls the House of Representatives — the Democrats — and who the current Secretary of Energy is — Jennifer Granholm. Then, I asked them how well they thought they did on the quiz.</p>\n<p>Many respondents who believed they were top performers were actually among those who scored the worst. Much akin to the results of a famous study by Dunning and Kruger, the poorest performers did not generally realize that they lagged behind their peers.</p>\n<p>Of the 1,209 people who participated, around 70% were overconfident about their knowledge of politics. But this basic pattern was not the most worrying part of the results. </p>\n<p>The overconfident respondents failed to change their attitudes in response to my warnings about political falsehoods. My investigation showed that they did read the statements, and could report details about what they said. But their attitudes toward falsehoods remained inflexible, likely because they — wrongly — considered themselves political experts.</p>\n<p>But if I could make overconfident respondents more humble, would they actually take my warnings about political falsehoods to heart?</p>\nPoor self-assessment\n<p>My experiment sought to examine what happens when overconfident people are told their political knowledge is lacking. To do this, I randomly assigned respondents to receive one of three experimental treatments after taking the political knowledge quiz. These were as follows:</p>\n\nRespondents received statements teaching them to avoid political falsehoods.\nRespondents did not receive the statements.\nRespondents received both the statements and a “reality check” treatment. The reality check showed how respondents fared on the political quiz they took at the beginning of the survey. Along with their raw score, the report showed how respondents ranked among 1,000 of their peers. \n\n<p>For example, respondents who thought they had aced the quiz might have learned that they got one out of five questions right, and that they scored worse than 82% of their peers. For many overconfident respondents, this “reality check” treatment brought them down to earth. They reported much less overconfidence on average when I followed up with them.</p>\n<p>Finally, I asked all the respondents in the study to report their levels of skepticism toward five statements. These statements are all common political falsehoods. One statement, for example, asserted that violent crime had risen over the prior decade — it hadn’t. Another claimed the U.S. spent 18% of the federal budget on foreign aid — the real number was less than 1%.</p>\n<p>I expected most respondents who had received my cautionary statements to become more skeptical of these misinformed statements. On average, they did. But did overconfident respondents learn this lesson too?</p>\n<p>The results of the study showed that overconfident respondents began to take political falsehoods seriously only if they had experienced my “reality check” treatment first. </p>\n<p>While overconfident respondents in other conditions showed no reaction, the humbling nature of the “reality check,” when they realized how wrong they had been, led overconfident participants in that condition to revise their beliefs. They increased their skepticism of political falsehoods by a statistically significant margin.</p>\n<p>Overall, this “reality check” experiment was a success. But it reveals that outside of the experiment, political overconfidence stands in the way of many Americans’ ability to accurately perceive political reality.</p>\n<p>What, if anything, can be done about the widespread phenomenon of political overconfidence?</p>\n<p>While my research cannot determine whether political overconfidence is increasing over time, it makes intuitive sense that this problem would be growing in importance in an era of online political discourse. In the online realm, it is often difficult to appraise the credibility of anonymous users. This means that false claims are easily spread by uninformed people who merely sound confident.</p>\n<p>To combat this problem, social media companies and opinion leaders could seek ways to promote discourse that emphasizes humility and self-correction. Because confident, mistaken self-expression can easily drown out more credible voices in the online realm, social media apps could consider promoting humility by reminding posters to reconsider the “stance,” or assertiveness, of their posts.</p>\n<p>While this may seem farfetched, recent developments show that small nudges can lead to powerful shifts in social media users’ online behavior. </p>\n<p>For example, Twitter’s recent inclusion of a pop-up message that asks would-be posters of news articles to “read before tweeting” caused users to rethink their willingness to share potentially misleading content. </p>\n<p>A gentle reminder to avoid posting bold claims without evidence is just one possible way that social media companies could encourage good online behavior. With another election season soon upon us, such a corrective is urgently needed.</p>\n<p></p><p>Ian Anson is associate professor of political science at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County.

        "link": "https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/09/we-cant-just-cover-the-same-old-shit-how-worker-owned-hell-gate-is-bringing-the-alt-weekly-voice-back-to-new-york-city/",
        "description": "<p>If you read The New York Times’ profile of Hell Gate NYC — the new worker-owned local news outlet covering New York City — you likely noticed the staff portraits in the story taken inside its spacious-looking office in the East Village.</p>\n<p>The founders wanted me to manage your expectations. They can’t afford to pay rent.</p>\n<p>“It’s actually an old Capital One bank branch on Avenue C that’s been vacant for some time,” co-publisher, editor, and writer Christopher Robbins said. “We are in it by the grace of the landlord and the Reverend Billy and the Stop Shopping Choir, who has somehow finagled it a way [for us] to be in that space. I wouldn’t want any readers to get the impression that we have, like, millions of dollars in venture capital that we’re [spending on] sushi Thursdays.”</p>\n<p>Hell Gate — named after the steel arch bridge over the East River that connects Queens and Randalls and Wards Islands — first started publishing in May 2022. Frustrated by the instability and cycles of layoffs in New York City media, Robbins and founding members Max Rivlin-Nadler, Esther Wang, Nick Pinto, and Sydney Pereira gathered 50 freelance journalists in January 2022 (outdoors, in 15-degree weather, with the promise of pizza and beer) to brainstorm what a worker-owned local news outlet could look like.</p>\n<p>“Every journalist-slash-blogger talks about starting something themselves. The thing that we wanted to start was something that centered the journalists and the writers,” Robbins said. “We wanted to see if we could start from scratch and have the journalists control the stories, the business model, and the brand. The thing that’s most important to us is making good journalism that people want to read.”</p>\n<p>Though NYC has more journalists than anywhere else in the U.S. — 12% of all newsroom employees in the country live in the city, Pew found in 2019 — some feel the five boroughs themselves are under covered. The New York Times long refocused on national and international news as it set its sights on selling subscriptions to “every curious, English-speaking person” on the planet. There are many local newsrooms, including The City, WNYC/Gothamist, and City Limits, hyperlocal neighborhood publications, along with a rich ecosystem of community media.</p>\n<p>But Hell Gate sees an opportunity for a publication, as the About page puts it, that’s “trenchant, playful, outraged, irreverent, and useful to readers.” (“And never a chore to read.”)</p>\n<p>Esther Wang — who covers state politics and fishing in the city’s polluted waters, among other topics, for Hell Gate — was previously the senior politics reporter at Jezebel and was working at the Gawker Media sister site when the newsroom came under the new ownership of G/O Media in 2019. The ordeal made her interested in trying something new.</p>\n<p>“It was exciting to [look at] all these new kinds of independent newsrooms that are opening up, and think we could do it for New York City. It’s a place where there’s a lot of news and there’s a lot of outlets, but something felt missing — something that was critical and fun,” Wang said. “I think that’s what we’re trying to do with Hell Gate.”</p>\n<p>Hell Gate reads a little like a local news version of Defector, the worker-owned sports and culture publication founded by former Deadspin staffers. (Hell Gate and Defector use the same company to manage their websites, and Hell Gate lists Defector, along with Discourse Blog, Racket, and the Colorado Sun, as inspiration.)</p>\n<p>The site’s overall voice and tone are reminiscent of the heyday of Gothamist, where Robbins, Rivlin-Nadler, Pinto, and Pereira all previously worked. In the early- to mid-2010s, it ran stories like “Soda Ban Has Burped Its Last: NYC Loses Final Appeal,” “The NY Times Is ON IT (Pubic Hair),“The MTA’s Making Up For Lost Time With Changes On The 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, A, C, E, F, J, L, M, N, Q &amp; R Trains This Weekend,” and “Why Emma Watson Should Skip Buying, Go Straight To Living With Me &amp; My Parents In Queens” alongside more straightforward stories on crime and local politics. But writers were allegedly underpaid and overworked. Billionaire Joe Ricketts, who also owned DNAinfo, bought the site in 2016, and in 2017, Gothamist and DNAinfo were both abruptly shut down a week after the staffs announced plans to unionize, effectively laying off all of their employees. In 2018, WNYC acquired Gothamist and relaunched it, and the pubic hair headlines of yesteryear are gone. (In the straightforward Gothamist of 2022, recent headlines included “Hudson River tunnel project will cost $2 billion more, take longer to complete, following further delay,” “NYC leaders will use pension funds to push Mastercard, AmEx to help flag gun sales.”)</p>\n<p>“[We’re] writing from a perspective where certain things are givens, like [that] housing and health care are human rights,” Robbins said. “The Village Voice used to be full of columns with a perspective and a sense of righteousness and also a sense of wonder about New York City. That sort of writing and reporting had bite and perspective and was compelling. We felt that was being crowded out by a lot of the important work being done by nonprofits across New York City. But it’s not the same thing. They can’t write the same way.”</p>\n<p>Hell Gate initially launched with $25,000 and $50,000 from The Harnisch Foundation and the Vital Projects Fund respectively, two New York-based organizations that support the arts. In July, Hell Gate launched a paywall with tiered subscriptions and recently gave readers a “peek behind the curtain” to explain that it’s counting on subscriber support. In the update, the co-owners told readers that their operating costs are about $20,000 per month and that they’re aiming to pay the staff of five $4,000 per month per person. (“And since we live in a corner of the world where health care is not a right but a prohibitively priced privilege, we would also like — if it’s possible, no worries if not! — to have a little health insurance,” they wrote.)</p>\n<p>“Our target audience is people who really care about the city,” Wang said. “A lot of our current readers are city employees, teachers, public defenders, people who are already very much enmeshed in the functioning of the city in their day-to-day lives. Our broader audience is really people who just love New York City — people who know it can be much better than it is now and care very much about that future, and care very much about maintaining the animating spirit of the city.”</p>\n<p>A basic annual subscription to Hell Gate is $70 and provides access to all published stories. The Supporter tier ($100 for one year) comes with the ability to comment on stories and a sticker. For $200 a year, readers get all of the above along with entry to “exclusive events” and “swag,” like a Hell Gate baseball cap. (For comparison, The City NY’s lowest membership tier is $120 annually while the highest costs $1,250 per year. Gothamist and WNYC’s Monthly Sustainers donation program starts at $10 per month and goes up to $100 per month. All three publications are free to read and don’t have paywalls.)</p>\n<p>Roughly a month after launching the paywall, Hell Gate has around 1,000 paying subscribers, Rivlin-Nadler said. About 10,000 people subscribe to the newsletter. Given that not-insignificant email list, they’re looking into adding advertising as a revenue stream down the line.</p>\n<p>To serve the most populous and diverse city in the country is a tall order. When asked about how Hell Gate thinks about diversity, Robbins and Wang said they knew firsthand that inclusion efforts in other newsrooms can be a form of lip service. As worker-owners at the helm, they’re in a unique position to define what Hell Gate’s values are and how those play into coverage. Robbins said that means they’ve spent hours deliberating decisions that often slow down Hell Gate’s production process, but knowing that in this growth stage, each choice can influence the next.</p>\n<p>“There has been a growing awareness at a lot of media outlets that we can’t just cover the same old shit,” Wang said. “We have to broaden our perspectives and cover the entire city and all of its residents. Just to give an example, one of my fishing columns focused on the question of whether the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation is unfairly targeting Chinese-American fishers in this city. For me it’s about what is an unexpected way to do this kind of coverage. I think it’s hard because we are a very small newsroom, but that’s how I’m trying to think about it.”</p>\n<p>As worker-owners, they’re wearing “different hats every hour,” Rivlin-Nadler said. For the first time, they’re the reporters, editors, human resources, accounting, sales, and customer service, all at once. Their decisions are colored and informed by the often traumatic reality of working in New York media.</p>\n<p>“One ‘luxury’ we have is that when venture capital or large investments or even large institutional partners enter into local news reporting, there’s a real pressure on return on investment in a place that is not very profitable,” Rivlin-Nadler said. “We are building it one brick at a time. We are working on getting this to be sustainable for a small newsroom, and we have the time to do that. So now we’ve got to figure out what is a good mix of stories for the amount of subscribers we have and the people that want to read the site and then the people who want to subscribe, as opposed to how can we grow the fastest and the quickest and monetize this as quickly as possible.”</p>\n<p></p>Photo of men playing cricket under the Hell Gate Bridge in New York by Rob Zand used under a Creative Commons license.<p></p>",

        "link": "https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/09/how-serena-williams-forced-sports-journalists-to-cover-tennis-as-more-than-a-game/",
        "description": "<p>Of the many outstanding components of her game, Serena Williams may best be known for her commanding serve.</p>\n<p>Those serves, unleashed over the course of a 27-year professional career, arguably heightened the power and intensity of the women’s game, forcing her opponents to game plan for each wicked volley.</p>\n<p>To those chronicling her exploits as one of the world’s best tennis players, Williams served up a different challenge.</p>\n<p>As a scholar of sports journalism, I have observed how its practitioners have struggled to find their footing when it comes to establishing consensus about what exactly constitutes good sports journalism.</p>\n<p>Williams’ presence as a Black woman in a historically white, patriarchal sport, her commitment to activism, and her willingness to bare her personal challenges to the public forced sports journalists to reevaluate professional norms that urged them to focus only on what happened between the lines.</p>\nApolitical origins\n<p>Sports journalism emerged in the late 19th century and fully established itself as a distinct journalism genre when newspaper publishers, in an effort to attract wider audiences, moved away from being partisan party organs. Sports quickly became a lucrative way to sell newspapers.</p>\n<p>Those apolitical origins shaped sports journalism’s future trajectory. Success often depended on access to players and front-office personnel, as well as cozy relationships with league officials. Chief among the outcomes of that arrangement was the general reluctance among sports journalists to cast a critical eye toward the role sports plays in our communities and greater society.</p>\n<p>In general, Americans often imagine sports as aligned with the values they hold dear. Journalists and public officials regularly talk about sports as the embodiment of a meritocracy and a reflection of the power of the individual to overcome any biases or challenges.</p>\n<p>Such media narratives fail to address how sports, despite all their feel-good moments, play a role in contributing to forms of discrimination and alienation.</p>\nReporters play in the toy box\n<p>By the late 20th century — just when Williams was emerging as a tennis star — the industry had turned into an enormous multimedia profit-making enterprise at a time when newspapers’ ad revenue was starting to crumble.</p>\n<p>Sports journalists had come to be seen by their news peers as playing in a proverbial “toy box” within the wider newsroom. That is to say, their colleagues saw them as frivolous, lacking in a serious approach. They weren’t there to serve as watchdogs or contribute solutions, through their reporting, to issues affecting the nation or local communities.</p>\n<p>Instead, sports journalists simply became known as sports gurus adept at parsing the finer points of a football receiver’s routes or debating the merits of a basketball team’s zone defense.</p>\n<p>And so when Williams turned professional in 1995 at the age of 14, early coverage sidestepped conversations about the unique kinds of gendered racism that a Black girl from a working-class California neighborhood might face on the professional tour.</p>\n<p>As sociologist Delia Douglas has explained, tennis has a history of being accessible only to people who can afford to play at resorts, country clubs and tennis academies. It is also a sport with different rules for men and women, a practice that contributes to stereotypes about women athletes as weak, or less interesting, than their male peers.</p>\n<p>But the context of Williams’ entry into professional tennis often went unacknowledged. Coverage instead focused on the efforts of her father to train his daughters, the passing of the baton from Venus to Serena, and the sisters’ style of play. Moreover, woven through that coverage was an underlying suggestion that Serena Williams did not fit within the definition of respectable tennis, as reporters commented on her fashion choices or wondered if her style of play was damaging the women’s game.</p>\nSports don’t happen in a vacuum\n<p>Practicing sports journalism by “sticking to sports” leaves reporters ill-equipped to cover news events that demand a wider lens.</p>\n<p>Such was the case in 2001 when fans at the Indian Wells tennis tournament subjected the Williams sisters to traumatizing racist insults, an experience that led the duo to boycott the event for 14 years.</p>\n<p>Researchers who studied the event found that most of the ensuing media coverage focused solely on the incident itself and provided little insight to address the forms of whiteness and patriarchy ingrained in pro tennis.</p>\n<p>This type of journalism is often described as episodic, in that it casts a light solely on the singular event, divorcing it from the forces that contributed to the specific situation. This framing technique is not uncommon in sports journalism. Coverage of the U.S. women’s gymnastics coach Larry Nassar, who was convicted of abusing dozens of athletes under his care, tended to focus on individual victim stories, while framing Nassar as “one bad apple.” And stories chronicling intimate partner violence committed by NFL players have a history of being framed similarly — a crime carried out by a singular individual, separate from a system that may foster violence toward women.</p>\n<p>But Williams demanded sports journalists do more than analyze her serve. She has spoken publicly from her own experiences about the tragedy of subpar maternal care for Black women. She asked journalists assembled at her post-championship match news conference at the U.S. Open in 2018 — where she had argued with the judge and been deducted a point — whether a man would be so acutely penalized for doing the same thing.</p>\n<p>She has pushed the boundaries of women’s tennis, and in doing so, has insisted that women be treated better by journalists and event organizers, calling for an end to the pay disparities between men and women on the professional tours.</p>\n<p>Scholarship on sports journalism suggests the boundaries of the genre are rapidly changing. And the field is shedding its stick-to-sports ethos, in part, due to activist-minded athletes like Serena Williams.</p>\n<p></p><p>Erin Whiteside is an associate professor of journalism and electronic media at the University of Tennessee.

        "description": "<p>My first move in the online game Harmony Square is to transform myself into a fake-news mastermind. “We hired you to sow discord and chaos,” my fictional boss informs me in a text box that pops up on a stark blue background. “We’ve been looking for a cartoonishly evil information operative. You seemed like a good fit.”</p>\n<p>Through a series of text-box prompts, the game goads me to inflame my pretend social media audience as much as possible. I stoke an online firestorm with a ginned-up takedown article about a fictitious local politician: “PLOOG LIED ABOUT PAST—SUPPORTED ANIMAL ABUSE IN COLLEGE!” At management’s behest, I unleash an army of bots to comment approvingly on my story, driving more traffic to it. As I escalate my crusade against Ploog, the game cheers me on.</p>\n<p>Harmony Square is one of several games University of Cambridge researchers have developed to bolster people’s resistance to disinformation. “What we thought would be interesting was having people make their own fake news in a safe environment,” says Cambridge psychologist Jon Roozenbeek, a lead researcher on the games project with fellow psychologist Sander van der Linden. “The goal is to prevent unwanted persuasion.”</p>\n<p>These games rest on a single, overarching premise: You can inoculate people against fake news by exposing them to small amounts of such content — much as low doses of live virus can vaccinate people against a disease — if you catch them before they are fully infected by conspiratorial belief. So far, games like Harmony Square are among the best-developed vehicles for disinformation inoculation. Researchers are also proposing and testing other, related strategies, including inoculating students in classroom settings, having people cook up their own conspiracy theories, and creating online classes that teach how to identify common fake-news tactics.</p>\n<p>Reaching enough people to achieve something akin to herd immunity against disinformation is a significant challenge, however. In addition to bolstering people’s BS detection skills, a broad immunity-building campaign would need to neutralize fake news’s strong emotional pull. “Even as this approach of science and inoculation takes off, the problem has to be solved at the cultural level,” says Subramaniam Vincent, director of journalism and media ethics at Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center. “So many efforts have to come together.”</p>\n<p>Mentally vaccinating people against fake news goes back to the 1960s, when psychologist William McGuire proposed making people resistant to propaganda using a strategy he called a “vaccine for brainwash.” Much as weakened viruses can teach the immune system to recognize and fight off disease, alerting people to false arguments — and refuting those arguments — might keep them from succumbing to deception, McGuire reasoned.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, the public-health recommendation that everyone visit a doctor every year. In an experiment, McGuire gave people counterarguments against going to the doctor annually (say, that regular visits promote health anxiety and actually lead people to avoid the doctor). Then he poked holes in those counterarguments (in reality, regular doctor visits reduce undue health anxiety). In McGuire’s studies, people became better at resisting false arguments after their beliefs were challenged.</p>\n<p>The inoculation messages warned people of impending attempts to persuade them, causing them to recognize that they might be vulnerable. The brain is wired to mount a defense against apparent threats, even cognitive ones; when challenged, people therefore seek fresh ways to protect their beliefs, much as they’d fight back if someone attacked them in a bar. Threat is a critical component of inoculation, says Josh Compton, a Dartmouth speech professor who specializes in inoculation theory. “Once we experience threat, we are motivated to think up counterarguments folks might raise and how we’ll respond,” he says.</p>\n<p>In the 1980s and 90s, experts put inoculation theory into practice with fairly limited goals, like preventing teenage smoking, and limited but promising outcomes. It wasn’t until the mid-2010s, as fake news gained traction online, that Cambridge’s Van der Linden was inspired to take the inoculation concept to a higher level. Like McGuire, he was convinced that “prebunking,” or sensitizing people to falsehoods before they encountered them, was better than debunking fake stories after the fact. Multiple studies show that once someone has internalized a nugget of false information, it’s very hard to get that person to disavow it, even if the original creator posts a correction.</p>\n<p>Van der Linden found that focusing on a single issue, as McGuire had done, has its limits. Warning people about lies on a particular subject like smoking may help them fend off falsehoods about that one topic, but it doesn’t help them resist fake news more broadly. So Van der Linden started focusing on building people’s general immunity by cluing them in to the persuasion techniques in every fake-news creator’s toolbox.</p>\n<p>In a series of mostly online studies, Van der Linden gave people general warnings about bad actors’ methods. For instance, he told them that politically motivated groups were using misleading tactics, like circulating a petition signed by fake scientists, to convince the public that there was lots of scientific disagreement about climate change. When Van der Linden revealed such fake-news tactics, people readily understood the threat and, as a result, got better at sniffing out and resisting disinformation.</p>\n<p>The idea of turning fake-news inoculation into something fun was conceived in 2016 at a bar in the Netherlands. Over beers with friends, Roozenbeek batted around the possibility of using a game to combat false information online. He created a prototype, which he called Bad News. As he researched the idea further, Roozenbeek came across Van der Linden’s studies, and the two agreed to work together on more advanced online inoculation games. Their collaboration expanded on Bad News, then added Harmony Square, which is now freely available at harmonysquare.game.</p>\n<p>In tongue-in-cheek fashion, the games introduce players to a host of common fake-news tactics. As I type a fake headline about a local politician in Harmony Square, my boss stresses the importance of stoking people’s fear with inflammatory language. “You missed some. Do better,” she scolds when I don’t include enough incendiary words like “corrupt” or “lie” in my headline. “Remember: Use words that upset people.” The game also goads me to create a website that claims to be a legitimate news outlet, sucking people in by projecting the appearance of credibility.</p>\n<p>The argument against these dishonest tactics is embedded in the game play. The more disinformation you spread, the more unrest you sow in the fictional town of Harmony Square. By the end of the game, normally placid townspeople are screaming at one another. As I play, I get caught up in the narrative of how fake-news tactics undermine community from within.</p>\n<p>To evaluate whether the games are truly effective, Roozenbeek and Van der Linden surveyed about 14,000 people before and after they played Bad News. After playing the game to the end, people were better overall at spotting falsehoods, rating the reliability of fake tweets and news reports about 20 percent lower than they had before. The effects lasted for more than two months. These results are in line with those of other anti-disinformation tactics such as correcting or fact-checking suspect content, according to a meta-analysis of such interventions by researchers from the University of Southern California.</p>\n<p>Social scientists see promise in the Cambridge team’s efforts to inoculate people against fake news. “Walking in the perpetrators’ shoes, so to speak, can be very effective for understanding how disinformation can be produced and some reasons why,” says Robert Futrell, a sociologist and extremism researcher at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, although he has not reviewed specific data from Bad News or Harmony Square.</p>\n<p>Even if they work well, games alone will not be enough to inoculate whole populations against online disinformation. Several million people have played the Cambridge team’s offerings so far, according to Roozenbeek, a tiny fraction of the global population. Daniel Jolley, a psychologist at the University of Nottingham, notes that large-scale inoculation will have to be implemented in a wide range of settings, from classrooms to community centers. Ideally, such programs should reach students during their school years, before they have been extensively exposed to fake news, Stanford education professor Sam Wineburg has argued.</p>\n<p>Finland is the first country to try inoculating people against fake news on a national scale. As Russian fake news began making its way across the border into Finland in 2014, the Finnish government developed a digital literacy course for state-run elementary and high schools. The curriculum, still in use, asks students to become disinformation czars, writing their own off-the-wall fake-news stories. As they learn how fake news is produced, students also learn to recognize and be skeptical of similar content in the real world.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, researchers and organizations are experimenting with inoculation efforts on a smaller scale. In Australia, communications professor John Cook designed an online course in 2015 to teach people how to detect common disinformation tactics used by climate deniers. So far, more than 40,000 people have enrolled in Cook’s course.</p>\n<p>In the United States, nonprofits like the News Literacy Project teach middle and high school students how to distinguish between fact and fiction in the media. NLP has developed a series of 14 interactive lessons, some of which walk students through fake-news creation and give examples of bogus stories likely to spread like wildfire (“Fireman Suspended &amp; Jailed by Atheist Mayor for Praying at Scene of Fire”). More than 40,000 U.S. educators have signed up to work with NLP so far. (The Science Literacy Foundation, which supports OpenMind, where this piece originally ran, is also a financial supporter of the News Literacy Project.)</p>\n<p>Adding to the challenge of fake-news inoculation, a serious literacy campaign must do more than train people to ferret out falsehoods. It must also counter the emotional pull of those falsehoods. People tend to wade into conspiracies and false narratives when they feel scared and vulnerable, according to Jolley. When their brains flood with stress hormones, their working memory capacity takes a hit, which can affect their critical thinking. “You’ve got the skills” to mentally counter conspiracy theories, Jolley says, “but you may not be able to use them.” Research shows that people who feel socially isolated are also more likely to believe in conspiracies.</p>\n<p>By contrast, the more fulfilled and capable people feel, the less vulnerable they are to disinformation. Jolley suggests that community-building ventures in which people feel part of a larger whole, like mentoring programs or clubs, could help individuals grow psychologically secure enough to resist the pull of a conspiracy theory. Making it easier to access mental health services, he adds, might also support people’s well-being in ways that improve their immunity to common fake-news tactics.</p>\n<p>As the disinformation-vaccine movement grows, one crucial unknown is just how much inoculation is enough. “What’s the equivalent of herd immunity for human society?” Vincent asks. “Do we have to have inoculation for, let’s say, 80% of a country in order for the spread of misinformation to be mitigated?” Calculating that percentage, he notes, is a complex undertaking that would have to account for different ways of reaching people online and the multiple strategies used to counter fake news.</p>\n<p>Given how challenging it will be to defang disinformation, it seems fitting that the Cambridge team’s Harmony Square game builds to an open-ended finish. When I complete the game’s final chapter, everyone in town is still fighting over the content my fake news empire churns out, and it’s unclear whether the destruction I’ve caused can be reversed. Surveying the damage, my boss applauds me. “They’re all at each other’s throats now.”</p>\n<p></p><p>Elizabeth Svoboda is a science writer in San Jose, Calif., and the author of What Makes a Hero?: The Surprising Science of Selflessness.

        "link": "https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/08/mediums-new-ceo-on-the-companys-journalism-mistakes-bundle-economics-and-life-after-ev-williams/",
        "description": "<p>Sometimes as a reporter you write a piece that is critical of a company and the company decides not to talk to you again for a long while, or ever again. Other times you write a critical piece and the CEO sends you a note that says hey, we should talk. And you hop on the phone and see whether you can find any common ground.</p>\n<p>I had the latter, more pleasant experience recently with Tony Stubblebine, who last month became the second CEO in Medium’s history. The publishing platform is no longer as buzzy as it was in the early 2010s, when its clean design and beautiful text editor helped it emerge as a kind of longform cousin to Twitter, with whom it shared a cofounder in Ev Williams.</p>\n<p>But it has been an occasional subject of interest for Platformer (where this piece originally appeared) as I report on changes to our information environment. Last year I wrote about the company’s move to hire and then suddenly lay off dozens of journalists for the second time in its history; in July I wrote about the company’s long history of business pivots amid Williams’ decision to step down.</p>\n<p>The fate of a blogging platform may have somewhat lower stakes than some of the subjects we usually discuss around here. But a key question at the intersection of tech and democracy is what sort of publishing models the internet will support. How many journalists and other writers will be able to make a living? How will their work find an audience? And will the platforms they operate on ever find long-term stability?</p>\n<p>In a phone call phone, the genial Stubblebine projected confidence as he talked me through his plans for the company. (He was funny, too: when I asked what we should expect from Medium over the next few quarters, he deadpanned: “I’m hoping to pivot every three months.”)</p>\n<p>Stubblebine may lack the high profile that his predecessor had in Silicon Valley as a cofounder of Blogger and Twitter. But the two men go way back — Stubblebine spent a year as vice president of engineering at Odeo, the company that would later evolve into Twitter. And he was one of Medium’s biggest fans from the start, as an original beta tester who shared office space with the team in its early days.</p>\n<p>Around that time, Stubblebine was working on a habit-building app called Lift; later he transitioned to build the online coaching service Coach.me. He began posting self-help content on Medium, which eventually turned into a big publication on the platform called Better Humans. (On his LinkedIn, Stubblebine says that Better Humans and its sister publications are responsible for 1% of all Medium traffic.)</p>\n<p>That gives Stubblebine a unique vantage point as he works to build a durable business around a company that raised $132 million. Medium reported last year that it has 725,000 paid subscribers for its $5-a-month, $50-a-year membership program; Stubblebine declined to give me an update on those numbers.</p>\n<p>Medium turned 10 this month, and celebrated with a blog post that recaps some of the most famous stories to appear on the platform, along with the product changes and business pivots it made along the way. I asked Stubblebine what he thinks Medium is 10 years later — and what he’d like it to be after he’s finished.</p>\n<p>Medium’s first role is a place for subject matter experts to share their knowledge, he told me. Most people don’t want to set up a blog or a newsletter; Medium fills a niche for people who have something to say only once in a while. The value the service provides lies in helping people find a broader audience than they might otherwise on their own, and enhancing the reputations of the people who publish there, Stubblebine said.</p>\n<p>“Medium is a place to write if you don’t already have an audience and you’re not trying to build an audience,” he said. Subject matter experts “are more interested in reach than they are in money, because they make their money somewhere else. So distribution is the first pitch.</p>\n<p>“But paired with that is ease — simple publishing tools. You don’t need to set up a WordPress hosted account. You don’t have to pay anything to publish here. The editor’s still very good. So it’s an easy way to get something out there.”</p>\n<p>The future of Medium lies more in people sharing-first hand experiences, he said — not paying journalists to go interview those people.</p>\n<p>“For me, fundamentally, the mistake was thinking that journalism was where Medium was going to shine,” he said. “We have the source material that feeds journalism. In a lot of ways that’s unique and special. And Medium exists to do something unique. It’s not supposed to reinvent the wheel.”</p>\n<p>Of course, all those volunteer subject-matter experts have another useful quality for Medium: they write on the platform for free. Stubblebine argues that the exposure can create opportunities — he cited Julie Zhuo, a former Facebook VP of design, who got a book deal after building a following on Medium. But that feels like weak tea in a world where top writers on Substack are making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. (See my ethics disclosure about Substack.)</p>\n<p>Medium does allow writers to make money through its partner program, which distributes funds from its subscription revenues based on an arcane formula related to how much time they spend reading each writer in relation to other writers in the program. Writers can also earn money by referring readers into the subscription plan. But if any writers are making a full-time living on Medium, they’ve been awfully quiet.</p>\n<p>And the current revenue share model means for every new writer that comes in, there’s less money to go around — something that the company has begun to acknowledge.</p>\n<p>“Our partners are more in competition with each other,” Stubblebine said. “Each new author comes in and they’re splitting the same pie.”</p>\n<p>Stubblebine said the economics of Medium’s offering to writers need to be improved. Specifically, writers who generate subscriptions need to be better compensated for them.</p>\n<p>“The issue right now is that we’re not paying enough for the subscribers you bring in yourself,” he said. “That’s basically, fundamentally, why it doesn’t work. And I think that’s crazy, right?”</p>\n<p>I do think that in a world where a writer can make $10 a month from thousands of people just by asking for it, Medium’s model does look like a relic. The company also faces a challenge from Twitter, which is testing a longform writing product of its own called Notes. Medium took off in part because Twitter users needed a place to write longer than 140 characters; soon they won’t have to leave the platform at all to do so.</p>\n<p>At the same time, it seems inevitable that some digital media upstart will succeed in offering a premium bundle of writers for some relatively low monthly price. The New York Times bought one such effort, sports-focused network The Athletic, for $550 million in January. (Another ethics disclosure: I’m making a podcast with the Times.)</p>\n<p>What The Athletic had, though, was premium journalism: some of the country’s top sportswriters, doing original reporting and analysis, on a regular cadence. Medium used to have that, too, and attracted hundreds of thousands of paying subscribers with it.</p>\n<p>But those journalists have been gone for more than a year now. And even at $50 a year, Medium’s grab-bag of first-person essays, self-help, and business analysis may struggle to compete against more professional offerings. Stubblebine told me he wants to get clearer on the bundle’s value proposition: right now Medium’s pitch is “unlimited reading,” he noted — not something most people are looking for.</p>\n<p>I’d like Medium to figure it out, if only because I like seeing writers get paid. Medium may never again be a destination for original journalism, but there’s no reason the company couldn’t make it easier for independent journalists and other writers to build businesses there, and improve its own prospects along the way.</p>\n<p>Stubblebine says he’s determined to take Medium public someday. After laying off another 29 employees this month, the team now numbers 78 people: a lean organization that will focus on quickly shipping changes to the core product, he told me.</p>\n<p>My fear, though, is that Medium continues to try to do it all on the cheap. Extracting the maximum amount of value out of the least expensive writers you can find isn’t a new approach in digital publishing, exactly, but it does feel somewhat out of step with the times.</p>\n<p>Because for all the hype about the creator economy, it has created avenues for a (too-small) group of independents to earn massive amounts of money by cultivating their niches. If the biggest opportunity Medium can offer its users is getting famous enough to make money in some other way, it’s hard to imagine the company putting together a roster of writers that will sustain hundreds of thousands of annual subscriptions or attract many new ones.</p>\n<p>For now, though, Stubblebine gives the company a fresh start — and a leader who, after 10 years actively using the product, sounds as excited about it as ever.</p>\n<p>“This is a really persistent company,” he said. “We don’t always make the right decision, but we’ve been really persistent.”</p>\n<p></p><p>Casey Newton is the editor-in-chief of Platformer, where this piece originally appeared.

        "description": "<p>Local election officials are trying to share voting information with the public on social media but may be missing some key platforms — and the voters who use them.</p>\n<p>In early July 2022, for instance, young voters in Boone County, Missouri, complained that they had missed the registration deadline to vote in the county’s Aug. 2 primary election. They claimed no one “spread the word on social media.” The local election office in that county actually has a social media presence on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok. But its accounts don’t have many followers and aren’t as active as, say, celebrity or teenage accounts are. As a result, election officials’ messages may never reach their audience.</p>\n<p>The Boone County example raises important questions about how prospective voters can get informed about elections, starting with whether or not local election officials are active on social media and whether they use these platforms effectively to “spread the word.”</p>\n<p>In our research as scholars of voter participation and electoral processes, we find that when local election officials not only have social media accounts but use them to distribute information about voting, voters of all ages — but particularly young voters — are more likely to register to vote, to cast ballots, and to have their ballots counted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, during the 2020 election, Florida voters who lived in counties where the county supervisor of elections shared information about how to register to vote on Facebook, and included a link to Florida’s online voter registration system, were more likely to complete the voter registration process and use online voter registration.</p>\n<p>In North Carolina, we found that voters whose county board of elections used Facebook to share clear information about voting by mail were more likely to have their mailed ballots accepted than mail voters whose county boards did not share instructions on social media.</p>\nYoung people face distinct voting challenges\n<p>Voter participation among young voters, those between the ages of 18 and 24, has increased in recent elections, but still lags behind that of older voters. One reason is that younger voters have not yet established a habit of voting.</p>\n<p>Even when they do try to vote, young voters face more barriers to participation than more experienced voters. They are more likely than older people to make errors or omissions on their voter registration applications and therefore not be successfully registered.</p>\n<p>When they do successfully complete the registration process, they have more trouble casting a vote that will count, especially when it comes to following all the steps required for voting by mail. When they try to vote in person, evidence from recent elections shows high provisional voting rates in college towns, suggesting college students may also experience trouble in casting a regular ballot owing to confusion about finding their polling place, or because they are not registered to vote because their voter registration application was not successfully processed.</p>\n<p>Some of these problems exist because voters, especially young ones, don’t know what they need to do to meet the voter eligibility requirements set by state election laws. Those laws often require registering weeks or months in advance of Election Day, or changing their registration information even if they move within a community.</p>\nSocial media as a tool to spread the word\n<p>Social media can be a way to get this important information out to a wider audience, including to the young voters who are more likely to need it.</p>\n<p>Younger people use social media more than older voters, with a strong preference for platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, and Snapchat.</p>\n<p>News outlets and political campaigns use social media heavily. But our analysis finds that the vast majority of local election officials don’t even have social media accounts beyond Facebook. And, when they do, it is likely that they are not effectively reaching their audience.</p>\nGaps in how local election officials use social media\n<p>We have found that during the 2020 U.S. presidential election, 33% of county election offices had Facebook accounts. Facebook is the most commonly used social media platform among Americans of all ages. But two-thirds of county election offices didn’t even have a Facebook account.</p>\n<p>Just 9% of county election offices had Twitter accounts, and fewer than 2% had accounts on Instagram or TikTok, which are more popular with young voters than Twitter or Facebook.</p>\nUsing social media for voter education\n<p>Local election officials are charged with sharing information about the voting process — including the mechanics of registering and voting, as well as official lists of candidates and ballot questions.</p>\n<p>Their default method of making this information available is often to share it on their own government websites. But young voters’ regular use of social media presents an opportunity for officials to be more active and engaged on those sites.</p>\n<p>While many election officials around the country face budget and staffing pressures, as well as threats to their safety, our research confirms that when officials do get involved on social media, young voters benefit – as does democracy itself.</p>\n<p></p><p>Thessalia Merivaki is an assistant professor of American Politics at Mississippi State University.

        "description": "<p>This is a true story: The summer after 7th grade, I wrote a letter, on looseleaf paper, to then NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, making what I considered a very logical argument: that Lafayette, Louisiana — the nearest city of any size to the town I lived in — should have an NFL team. Deserved an NFL team, actually.1</p>\n<p>My supporting data was concise and direct. In the 1980 census, The World Almanac &amp; Book of Facts told me, Lafayette had a population of 80,584 people. Meanwhile, Green Bay, Wisconsin — home of the 11-time world champion Packers — was barely bigger, at 87,947. By 1988, when I was writing, Lafayette was probably even a bit bigger than the burg with the frozen tundra. Just thinking logically, the fact that Green Bay could support a big-league football team proved that the home of the Ragin’ Cajuns could too.2</p>\n<p>I did not get a reply from the commish, which I still consider a personal affront. </p>\n<p>The Green Bay Packers are the NFL’s great exception. A century ago, there were plenty of small cities with big-league football teams — the Tonawanda Kardex Lumbermen, the Dayton Triangles, the Oorang Indians. But almost none could survive the 1920s, as larger markets beckoned. The Packers were the exception, the one team that never scrambled off to the big city. That’s because of its unique ownership structure: It’s owned by community shareholders, not a rapacious billionaire chasing whichever ambitious mayor he thinks will build him a stadium next.</p>\n<p>Their unusual success has inspired imitators — in the news business, of all places.3 The community-ownership ideal is appealing to many who see local news as a valuable civic service. And the Packers are metaphorically appealing as a highly successful point of comparison. (Most business models haven’t won a Super Bowl!)</p>\n<p>Here’s the L.A. Times in 2006:</p>\n<p></p>Another sports ownership example worth contemplating is community ownership, like that of the Green Bay Packers football team. Article I of its bylaws states, “This association shall be a community project, intended to promote community welfare … its purposes shall be exclusively charitable.” Sound appealing? If 20% of Times readers invest $1,000, it could work. I’ll write the first check for the Los Angeles Times Community Owners LLC.<p></p>\n<p>The Seattle Times in 2009:</p>\n<p></p>Meanwhile, another group of former P-I journalists, calling itself Seattle Post Globe, is working to put together an online local-news outlet that might be owned by community members, along the lines of the National Football League’s Green Bay Packers.<p></p>\n<p>CJR in 2015:</p>\n<p></p>Modeled on the publicly-owned Green Bay Packers of the NFL, where community members own shares but can’t sell them for a profit, the idea is that shareholders will be “part of the team,” Platt says.<p></p>\n<p>Poynter in 2017:</p>\n<p></p>This model was pioneered by the Green Bay Packers — one of the most successful NFL franchises, and gives readers a financial stake in the news organization’s success.<p></p>\n<p>Or, er, some site named Nieman Lab:</p>\n<p></p>Based solely on the numbers, the Green Bay Packers shouldn’t exist. Its stadium, Lambeau Field, has a max capacity of 81,435 people, almost large enough to seat every single person in 105,000-resident Green Bay…The team owes its longevity and succes…in part to its unique ownership structure: It’s the only community-owned nonprofit team in the NFL.<p></p>\n<p>The most recent iteration of this theme came a month ago, when we learned about “a Green Bay Packers-style approach to rescue [a] Colorado newspaper”:</p>\n<p></p>An intriguing new approach to saving local newspapers is percolating in Aurora, Colorado.<p></p>\n<p>The Sentinel, a strong weekly with daily email newsletters, was acquired this month by a holding company that’s pursuing a Green Bay Packers-style model of community ownership, with shares sold to residents and supporters.</p>\n<p>The goal is to have local owners save an essential local news source, and perhaps create an approach other communities can use to save their newspapers.</p>\n<p>Dave Perry, The Sentinel’s longtime editor, said the Packers model “is perfect for Aurora.”</p><p></p>\n<p>I wish the Sentinel nothing but the best, and am always happy to see different models being tested. But as the NFL preps for its opening kickoff this week, I feel the need to point out that the Packers are, in many ways, a uniquely bad metaphor for a local news business. (That feudalism worked great for Charlemagne doesn’t mean it’ll work for your tech startup.) Running a local news site is quite different from running a multi-billion-dollar football team! And before this model gets out of hand, let’s look at a few of the most important reasons why.</p>\n1st Down: Packers stock is worthless beyond fandom.\n<p>You know how there are people who will “sell” you a tract of land on the moon or a planet? Or even ownership of some star billions of light years away? Extraterrestrial real estate lies somewhere between entertainment and scam, given that the people “selling” the land don’t “own” it themselves, and your “ownership” will be accepted by no court of law, earthly or otherwise. But if you send in your money, you’ll get a certificate you can slap on your wall, as well as the ambient sense of status that comes with “owning” a corner lot in Mare Cognitum.</p>\n<p>Owning a share of the Green Bay Packers isn’t a scam, to be clear — but it’s a lot closer to lunar real estate than what you’d normally associate with owning stock. </p>\n<p>If you buy a share of Apple, you own a financial asset. If someone wants to buy it from you, you can sell it to them. If you want to buy more, you can buy more. If Apple does well, it’ll probably grow in value. Every quarter, Apple will take some portion of its profits and pay it directly to you in the form of a dividend. </p>\n<p>If you want to buy a share of the Green Bay Packers, you mostly own…a certificate you can slap on your wall. Oh, and the right to buy a t-shirt or a garden stone proclaiming you a Green Bay Packers “owner.” </p>\n<p>One Packers share costs a round $300 (“plus a handling fee of $35 for each certificate”); it grants you no equity in the team and no dividends, ever. You can’t sell it to anyone, ever; you can only give it “to immediate family or any lineal descendants,” and then only by paying an additional $25 “transfer fee” to the Packers. If the team catches you trying to give or sell it to anyone else, it has the unilateral right to buy back your $300 shares of stock at 2½ cents each — which is not usually how property rights work.</p>\n<p>As the Packers’ most recent stock offering put it, in all caps: “COMMON STOCK DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVESTMENT IN ‘STOCK’ IN THE COMMON SENSE OF THE TERM. PURCHASERS SHOULD NOT PURCHASE COMMON STOCK WITH THE PURPOSE OF MAKING A PROFIT. IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO REALIZE A PROFIT ON A PURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK OR EVEN TO RECOUP THE AMOUNT INITIALLY PAID TO ACQUIRE SUCH COMMON STOCK.” The offering document is studded with headers like “Not an Investment,” “No Securities Law Protection,” and “No Profits or Dividends.”</p>\n<p>Oh, and if you want to buy one tomorrow…too bad. Packers shares have only been sold six times in the past century (1923, 1935, 1950, 1997, 2011, 2021). The most recent sales have been done to fund stadium projects.</p>\n<p>So what do you get as a Packers shareholder? Again, there’s the certificate, and the chance to buy that garden stone. You get to attend the team’s annual shareholder meeting, which seems like a nice afternoon at Lambeau. What about governance? You get to vote on any new members of the board of directors — but the only nominees are the ones put forward by the team itself. Corporate democracy this ain’t. There is no shareholder quorum large enough to bench Aaron Rodgers or fire Matt LaFleur.</p>\n<p>(Shareholders even get some fun new financial liability with their certificate! Packers shareholders are strictly prohibited from “publicly criticizing any NFL member club or its management, employees or coaches or any football official employed by the NFL.” Commissioner Roger Goodell “has the authority to fine such shareholder up to $500,000.” Luckily, no self-respecting football fan has ever criticized the refs, so no such enforcement has ever been required.)</p>\n<p>This isn’t “community ownership” in any significant sense. Local cooperatives can be a real pain to organize — just ask the people who’ve tried to do it with local news sites, or grocery buyers in Brooklyn — but they can achieve something approximating community control. Buying a share of the Packers is more like buying a game-worn Brett Favre jersey at the Lambeau Field pro shop — an expensive but effective way to demonstrate your fandom, to yourself and to others.</p>\n<p>The one thing the Packers’ ownership structure does (functionally) guarantee is that it’ll never load up the Mayflower trucks and become the London Cockneys or the Montreal Emballeurs. Local control self-perpetuates through a board that selects its new members. But how often is relocation a problem for local news organizations? Are all the county-seat weeklies in Indiana moving to Chicago or something?</p>\n2nd Down: The NFL is socialism. Local news is not.\n<p>The late Cleveland Browns (and Baltimore Ravens, ugh) owner Art Modell once described NFL owners as “a bunch of fat-cat Republicans who vote socialist on football.” While teams are independently owned, the revenues their games generate are shared out equally to an extraordinary extent. </p>\n<p>Individual teams get to keep 60% of their home-stadium ticket sales, most of game-day concessions, and whatever local corporate sponsorships they can arrange. But the really big money — the league’s multi-billion-dollar TV deals, league-wide licensing deals, merchandising, the NFL Network, the other 40% of ticket sales — are distributed equally among the league’s 32 teams, whether they’re in New York and L.A. or Green Bay and Buffalo. That shared revenue amounts to around $11 billion a year. Whether you’re the best team or the worst — in the biggest market or the smallest — that money gets shared equally.4</p>\n<p>That’s great for comparative parity between teams. Every team has (roughly) the same amount of money to spend on players, and they’re all governed by the same salary cap — which means the NFL doesn’t get dominated by a few megarich teams in the biggest cities. Small markets can compete for the best players on a nearly equal basis; a team in the No. 36 media market can go from worst-in-the-league to the Super Bowl in two years.</p>\n<p>Contrast that with what has historically been America’s least socialist sport: Major League Baseball. MLB teams negotiate their own local TV deals, which include the majority of their games. Those rights are a lot more valuable in L.A. or Chicago than in Cincinnati or Cleveland. As of 2020, the Los Angeles Dodgers were earning $239 million a year from their local deal — nearly 10 times the Milwaukee Brewers’ $28 million. </p>\n<p>MLB does have a (not well designed) revenue-sharing model — but it still allows teams to spend wildly different amounts of money trying to win. This season, the three biggest-spending teams are L.A.’s Dodgers and New York’s Yankees and Mets. Together, their player payrolls add up to more than $778 million. That’s about as much as the bottom 10 teams combined. When a star player hits free agency, the default assumption among fans is that he’ll probably end up on the Yankees, Dodgers, or one of a few other big-market teams. </p>\n<p>How does the NFL’s socialism compare to the economics of the local news business? There’s no revenue sharing in newspapers. The New York Times doesn’t have to hand over 60% of its revenues to be redistributed to papers in Peoria, Tucson, and Shreveport. The dailies in Boston and Omaha aren’t guaranteed the same newsroom budgets.</p>\n<p>There’s no “league” of 32 local news sites serving as an effective cartel, blocking new competition from their playing field. And if a star reporter is looking for a new gig, can the Hometown Gazette realistically compete for her services at the same level as the Times, the Post, CNN, or ProPublica? If someone like David Fahrenthold wants to leave the Post, is his next job likely to be at the Green Bay Press-Gazette? Nah — he’s going to sign with the Yankees.</p>\n3rd Down: A local team doesn’t mean local ownership — or a local audience.\n<p>At the Packers’ most recent stock offering, in 2021, the team sold about 198,000 new shares at $300 a pop. Did they all go to local cheesemakers, “Laverne &amp; Shirley” cosplayers, or other stereotypical denizens of the Badger State? No — only about 17 percent of the new shares were bought by Wisconsinites. </p>\n<p>Green Bay may be the smallest market for an NFL team, but it also has, by many measures, the largest fan base. YouGov’s most recent polling says the Packers, despite being in the 69th-largest media market, is currently the No. 1 NFL team in popularity.</p>\n<p>In sports, the relationship between population and popularity isn’t as tight as you might imagine. The Steelers, Saints, and Chiefs play in media markets No. 26, 50, and 34 — but in popularity, they rank No. 2, 3, and 6. Meanwhile, the Jets, Eagles, Falcons, and Texans play in markets No. 1, 4, 7, and 8 — but in popularity, they’re No. 15, 17, 24, and 26.</p>\n<p>The National Football League is national. There are Packers fans in Idaho, Saints fans in Alaska. An NFL fan only gets to watch their local team once a week, but there’ll be almost a dozen other teams on TV during that span. Into fantasy football? You’re watching individual players across the league. How many Tom Brady fans switched loyalties from the Pats to the Bucs without moving to Florida?</p>\n<p>Does any of that apply to a local news site? Are only 17 percent of your paying subscribers going to be from your city? Will millions of people track the byline counts of your reporters because they’ve got $200 on the line if they have a productive week?</p>\n4th Down: The Packers only work because they’re the exception.\n<p>The Packers’ setup is a nice story — a useful counterpoint to every Dan Snyder anecdote. But the truth is that what makes the Packers a successful enterprise is that they are a team in the National Football League, an attention-dominating powerhouse that produced 75 of the 100 highest-rated TV shows of 2021.5 Even the NFL teams with terrible owners are still worth billions. A majority of team owners inherited the team from their dad or grandpa, not because they climbed the ranks of business, and many hold onto control into their 90s.</p>\n<p>The Packers’ ownership structure does minimize the chances of team control falling to some family’s Fredo or Buster. But the league’s Fredos and Busters (and they exist!) still make bank.</p>\n<p>You couldn’t have a league with teams based in 32 Green Bays — for the simple reason that someone else would start a league with teams in New York, L.A., etc. and make a lot more money. But the NFL is foolproof enough to let one tiny market live among the giants without a hitch.</p>\n<p></p><p></p>\n<p>None of this is to say that community ownership isn’t an interesting option for local news outlets. It’s proven to be a difficult one, time and time again, but in the right place with the right audience, it can work. Maybe, in your community, an “ownership” metaphor will be more fruitful in appealing to your biggest fans than “membership” or “subscriber benefits” would be.</p>\n<p>But the prerequisite for a community ownership model is an engaged, loyal fan base. If you don’t have that, well, you’re out of luck — turning yourself into a penny stock won’t help. But if you do have that fan base, a Packers-style ownership model is only one of the ways you can convert that into a sustainable business.6</p>\n<p>And the success of the Green Bay Packers is not evidence that community ownership (or “ownership”) is a uniquely potent solution. The Packers could be run by military junta, constitutional monarchy, or anarchist collective — so long as the NFL lets it play 17 games a season, it’ll be a moneymaker. The biggest problem that community ownership solves — the temptation to relocate to a bigger city — is one local news outlets don’t really have. </p>\n<p>The business takeaway from the Packers should be something like: If you get the chance to be one of a 32-member socialist cartel in your country’s favorite sport, you should do it — you’ll get rich. Not: The key to their success is the shareholder-only garden stones.</p>\n<p></p>Image created with Midjourney: “the Green Bay Packers playing a football game while each player reads a newspaper, in the style of LeRoy Neiman –ar 16:9.”<p></p>\nThis would’ve been 1988.

        "description": "<p>Have you noticed that some news article cards on Twitter are looking a little different lately? The social media company rolled out Tweet Tiles — “a new, customizable way to expand the creative surface area of a Tweet” — to three news publishers last week, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed.</p>\n<p>The change is one of the biggest tweaks to article preview cards since summary cards appeared on the scene back in 2015. The customizable image, format, and interactive elements could help news orgs distinguish themselves in feeds and, ultimately, drive more engagement.</p>\n<p>For the experiment, Twitter partnered with The New York Times, The Guardian, and The Wall Street Journal. (The three news publishers were selected for their “highly engaged and trusted audiences,” according to Twitter.) Tweet Tiles will be visible to half of people on iOS and Web, with the other half seeing standard summary cards.</p>\n\n<p>Today we’re beginning to test Tweet Tiles with @nytimes, @wsj and @guardian.

        "description": "<p>From the COVID-19 pandemic to the war in Ukraine, misinformation is rife worldwide. Many tools have been designed to help people spot misinformation. The problem with most of them is how hard they are to deliver at scale.</p>\n<p>But we may have found a solution. In our new study we designed and tested five short videos that “prebunk” viewers, in order to inoculate them from the deceptive and manipulative techniques often used online to mislead people. Our study is the largest of its kind and the first to test this kind of intervention on YouTube. Five million people were shown the videos, of which one million watched them.</p>\n<p>We found that not only do these videos help people spot misinformation in controlled experiments, but also in the real world. Watching one of our videos via a YouTube ad boosted YouTube users’ ability to recognize misinformation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As opposed to prebunking, debunking (or fact-checking) misinformation has several problems. It’s often difficult to establish what the truth is. Fact-checks also frequently fail to reach the people who are most likely to believe the misinformation, and getting people to accept fact-checks can be challenging, especially if people have a strong political identity.</p>\n<p>Studies show that publishing fact-checks online does not fully reverse the effects of misinformation, a phenomenon known as the continued influence effect. So far, researchers have struggled to find a solution that can rapidly reach millions of people.</p>\nThe big idea\n<p>Inoculation theory is the notion that you can forge psychological resistance against attempts to manipulate you, much like a medical vaccine is a weakened version of a pathogen that prompts your immune system to create antibodies. Prebunking interventions are mostly based on this theory.</p>\n<p>Most models have focused on counteracting individual examples of misinformation, such as posts about climate change. However, in recent years researchers including ourselves have explored ways to inoculate people against the techniques and tropes that underlie much of the misinformation we see online. Such techniques include the use of emotive language to trigger outrage and fear, or the scapegoating of people and groups for an issue they have little-to-no control over.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>An example of a social media post (which we used as one of the stimuli in our study) that makes use of a false dichotomy (or false dilemma), a commonly used manipulation technique.</p>\n\n<p>Online games such as Cranky Uncle and Bad News were among the first attempts to try this prebunking method. There are several advantages to this approach. You don’t have to act as the arbiter of truth as you don’t have to fact-check specific claims you see online. It allows you to side-step emotive discussions about the credibility of news sources. And perhaps most importantly, you do not need to know what piece of misinformation will go viral next.</p>\nA scalable approach\n<p>But not everyone has the time or motivation to play a game — so we collaborated with Jigsaw (Google’s research unit) on a solution to reach more of these people. Our team developed five prebunking videos, each lasting less than two minutes, which aimed to immunize viewers against a different manipulation technique or logical fallacy. As part of the project, we launched a website where people can watch and download these videos.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Screenshots from one of the videos.</p>\n\n<p>We first tested their impact in the lab. We ran six experiments (with about 6,400 participants in total) in which people watched one of our videos or an unrelated control video about freezer burn. Afterward, within 24 hours of viewing the video, they were asked to evaluate a series of (unpublished) social media content examples that either did or did not make use of misinformation techniques. We found that people who saw our prebunking videos were significantly less liable to manipulation than the control participants.</p>\n<p>But findings from lab studies do not necessarily translate to the real world. So we also ran a field study on YouTube, the world’s second-most visited website (owned by Google), to test the effectiveness of the video interventions there.</p>\n<p>For this study, we focused on U.S. YouTube users over 18 years old who had previously watched political content on the platform. We ran an ad campaign with two of our videos, showing them to around 1 million YouTube users. Next, we used YouTube’s BrandLift engagement tool to ask people who saw a prebunking video to answer one multiple-choice question. The question assessed their ability to identify a manipulation technique in a news headline. We also had a control group, which answered the same survey question but didn’t see the prebunking video. We found the prebunking group was 5-10% better than the control group at correctly identifying misinformation, showing that this approach improves resilience even in a distracting environment like YouTube.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the prebunking videos (“false dichotomies”).</p>\n\n<p>Our videos would cost less than 5¢ per video view (this would cover YouTube advertising fees). As a result of this study, Google is going to run an ad campaign using similar videos in September 2022. This campaign will be run in Poland and the Czech Republic to counter disinformation about refugees within the context of the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>\n<p>When you are trying to build resilience, it is useful to avoid being too direct in telling people what to believe, because that might trigger something called psychological reactance. Reactance means that people feel their freedom to make decisions is being threatened, leading to them digging their heels in and rejecting new information. Inoculation theory is about empowering people to make their own decisions about what to believe.</p>\n<p>At times, the spread of conspiracy theories and false information online can be overwhelming. But our study has shown it is possible to turn the tide. The more that social media platforms work together with independent scientists to design, test, and implement scalable, evidence-based solutions, the better our chances of making society immune to the onslaught of misinformation.</p>\n<p></p><p>Jon Roozenbeek is a postdoctoral fellow in psychology at the University of Cambridge.

        "link": "https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/08/how-the-ap-usa-today-and-northeastern-built-a-database-of-mass-killings-that-tracks-more-than-shootings/",
        "description": "<p>Public mass shootings — ones that unfold in elementary schools, supermarkets, and parades — tend to receive the most media attention but a new database compiled by the Associated Press, USA Today, and Northeastern University reveals mass killings are far more likely to take place in private homes than in public spaces.</p>\n<p>“A guy who kills his wife and children and sometimes kills himself is the most common type of mass killing,” said James Fox, a professor of criminology, law, and public policy at Northeastern University who worked on the database. But “although it is relatively easy to acquire information about the most high profile cases given the amount of press coverage, press briefings by law enforcement, and sometimes even reports from ad hoc investigations, most mass killings receive rather little coverage.” </p>\n<p>The newly public Mass Killings Database is one of the most comprehensive datasets assembled on the topic. It tracks all U.S. homicides since 2006 where four or more people — not including the offender – were killed. Each incident has dozens of data fields including location and detailed information about the offender (name, age, race, sex, and any previous criminal record), victims (including cause of death and relationship to the assailant), and weapon (including, if applicable, gun type, model, manufacturer, and caliber). The collaborative project has been underway since 2018 and revives an earlier iteration of the database launched by USA Today in 2012.</p>\n<p>The architects of the dataset — including Fox and Josh Hoffner, director of U.S. news at the Associated Press — say they hope journalists will use the information to find local angles, add context to important stories, and spot trends. As one example, Hoffner noted that AP journalists used the database after 11 people were murdered at a Virginia Beach government building in 2019.</p>\n<p>“We were able to look at the data and identify the frequency of workplace mass killings from the data and tell a more complete story of workplace violence,” Hoffner said. “The data told us that there had been 11 such mass killings since 2006. We hope that type of coverage will repeat itself time and time again by journalists around the U.S. because of the project.”</p>\n<p>The dataset is continually updated. (The last update was less than 14 hours before this article published.) That means reporters can get real-time insight into the trend lines of mass killings. </p>\n<p>“During the Uvalde breaking news coverage, we were able to immediately add context to the urgent story to say: This was the 14th mass killing at a school since the 1990s and 12th mass killing overall this year,” Hoffner said. “Reporters can now do the same on their stories and break them down in various ways.”</p>\n<p>A team of data scientists, reporters, and researchers worked to create the dataset. They began with the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), which Fox described as having “a rather high error rate” when it comes to mass killings. (The entire state of Florida is missing from the dataset as well as major incidents like the Sutherland Springs church shooting.) In addition, the SHR relies on police records that often list victims injured alongside ones who ultimately died in a single file. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, Fox noted the FBI reports proved helpful for identifying cases that did not attract news coverage, including family massacres and gang and drug-related incidents. </p>\n<p>The team sought to corroborate each data point with multiple sources and filled in the blanks in the SHR files with extensive searches using internet search engines, Lexis-Nexis, and Newspapers.com. Researchers also regularly contacted AP reporters on the ground for information in their notebooks or to ask them to access relevant court files. </p>\n<p>“There are also lots of mass killings (domestic incidents in isolated regions for example) that don’t garner much attention,” Hoffner said. “Those cases require us to do more digging to obtain the relevant data.”</p>\n<p>In the days and months following a mass killing, more information becomes publicly available and, ultimately, reflected in the database. Fox said he believes the AP-USA Today-Northeastern database is the only one to include court and sentencing data.</p>\n<p>There are other databases that track mass shootings — including ones compiled by The Violence Project and Mother Jones — but the Mass Killings Database includes deaths from the 20% of mass killings that do not involve a firearm.</p>\n<p>“Those who are killed with a knife, a blunt object, strangulation, a vehicle ramming, or fire are just as dead,” Fox said. “And even though they do not invoke the debate over gun control, these crimes matter no less just because a gun wasn’t involved.”</p>",

        "link": "https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/08/this-group-helps-product-people-realize-theyre-product-people/",
        "description": "<p>In February 2020, after an SRCCON session for product thinkers proved unexpectedly popular, it was clear to organizers there was an appetite for a product-focused community in the news industry. Though product roles have existed in legacy news outlets for years, bringing product thinking — which centers the needs of news consumers and prioritizes testing during development — into a newsroom for the first time can be an uphill battle for those hoping to usher in the change.</p>\n<p>The News Product Alliance — which officially launched in September 2020 — believes product thinkers are “the missing link to creating sustainable journalism in the digital age.” On its site, the group defines product roles as those “with the ability to strategically align business, audience and technology goals while integrating journalism ethics.” About a third of news product workers have titles or departments with “product” in them. The rest are doing news product work in less obvious “bridge” roles, under titles like audience editor, news applications developer, or head of analytics.</p>\n<p>“Some of our community members were actually doing product work without knowing they were doing product work,” said executive director Feli Carrique. “A lot of our community members have told us that NPA helped them put a name to what they were doing and helped them gain confidence in that.”</p>\n<p>According to a 2021 report, product teams are still relatively new, with 40% of responding news organizations saying they’d formed a product team in the past four years. But research suggests merely establishing a product team isn’t enough. The Reuters Institute’s 2022 Journalism, Media, and Trends report found that 41% of surveyed news publishers find a lack of alignment between different departments — editorial, marketing, commercial, and technology — to be a major roadblock to innovation.</p>\n<p>“We have previously highlighted how the vertically siloed nature of many media companies makes it particularly difficult to deliver innovation that needs cross-functional teams to work in a common process,” the Reuters report noted. Even publishers with “mature” product departments are still working to “find the right balance between the rigor of product methodologies and processes and the specific editorial expertise” of their newsroom, according to the report.</p>\n<p>Carrique said product teams in media organizations can vary wildly in how they function, what skills are considered standard, and where they sit within the company’s structure. For people looking to get into news product work for the first time, the lack of consensus can make the process more difficult.</p>\n<p>With the state of news product work seeming to range across the industry, the News Product Alliance helps identify what product work even is and get it named as such in participating newsrooms. In short? They help product people realize they’re product people.</p>\n<p>Going into its third year, NPA is a mostly, if not fully, virtual community that mainly operates in its own growing Slack channel, with more than 1,400 members. (NPA membership has just about tripled since launch, Carrique said.) Roughly half of its members are based in North America while 16% are in Europe and 15% are in Central and South America. Outside the United States, countries with the most members include Brazil, Argentina, Germany, the United Kingdom, and India. NPA members are news product managers, journalists, developers, technologists, data scientists, and other media and tech professionals.</p>\n<p>NPA’s Slack is free to join and the resources on its website are publicly available. Its Product Kit, as one example, has been translated by NPA volunteers into Spanish and Portuguese with additional editions in Italian and Arabic on the way. The resources and programming address what Carrique identified as some of the common challenges news product workers face, from implementing new strategies to transitioning into a product-focused role to developing workflows and planning projects.</p>\n<p>The organization has held two annual, virtual summits where ticket costs ranged from $150 to $450. (The NPA is sponsored by the nonprofit Miami Foundation and has received funding from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Google News Initiative, The University of Missouri School of Journalism, the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY, and News Catalyst.) The 2022 summit drew 482 attendees, including 169 first-time participants. Sponsorship from the Google News Initiative allowed NPA to award 120 scholarships to attendees. According to Carrique, more than 50% of scholarship recipients are people of color and 60% live outside the U.S.</p>\n<p>The NPA has touted its work helping people move into product and product-adjacent roles in news organizations. Members have shared more than 500 job postings in the Slack’s jobs channel in the last 18 months, Carrique said. Of the nearly 200 summit attendees who reported a job title or job change toward product work in the past year, about 70% said joining and participating in NPA had “some level of direct impact” on their career shifts.</p>\n<p>NPA has moved to get product thinking into more newsrooms by partnering with the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY to co-host the Product Immersion for Small Newsrooms program, a crash course in news product development, and the Product Expansion program, a followup for alumni of the immersion program. NPA’s creative director Tony Elkins also hosts a newsletter-turned-live-event series called “How I” where he interviews news product people about their career paths.</p>\n<p>Still, many members report that the community’s biggest benefit has been access to other product thinkers and workers through the Slack’s public channels and the direct messaging feature. They’ve been able to find mentors in other newsrooms, get help on job applications and interviews, ask for advice on projects, and more.</p>\n<p>Some of the most active channels are #intros (for new members to introduce themselves), #ask-and-give (to ask and give help), #shop-talk (to discuss best practices in news product management), and #show-and-tell (for sharing guides, trainings, and other resources). According to Carrique, roughly 40% of members participate at least weekly in the Slack with additional spikes of activity around events like the News Product Summit.</p>\n<p>Khalil Cassimally is the audience project manager for The Conversation and based in Mauritius. He joined NPA’s Slack in 2021 and felt he’d finally found his “people.” Through Donut, a Slack app that pairs members up and nudges them to get to know each other one-on-one, Cassimally said he met “some really smart people” he’s gone on to contact when he needed feedback or work-related advice.</p>\n<p>“E-meeting people from different parts of the world, though mostly from the U.S., generates a lot of ideas and can also provide affirmation about tactics or strategies I’ve been contemplating,” he said. “Since joining the NPA Slack community, I’ve been able to come up with more ideas and have become more confident proposing those ideas to leadership as well. I’ve also been able to fill gaps in knowledge by actively reaching out to certain people in the community.”</p>\n<p>For Sydney Lewis, a student at the University of Missouri, joining NPA filled a gap in her education that she didn’t know she had.</p>\n<p>“Through NPA, I was able to meet news product allies at my own university which led me to fantastic mentors and programs that I never would’ve found otherwise,” Lewis said. “NPA’s connections and mentorship have exposed me to a side of journalism I didn’t know existed a year ago, and to a new way of thinking that I’ve now introduced into the student newsrooms I oversee at the University of Missouri.”</p>\n<p>NPA wants to practice what it preaches and tries to apply product thinking to the way it runs its own community, Carrique said. NPA asks members what they want, the members tell them, NPA tries to provide it, and the feedback loop continues. Given widespread interest in mentorship, NPA has focused its resources on building the Mentor Network Program, which will launch on September 12. Its goal is to provide guidance and support to emerging news product thinkers in their professional development. So far, 50 mentors from around the world have agreed to participate, Carrique said.</p>\n<p>“What we’ve learned is that there’s a lot of people who would want more formal mentorship and coaching spaces so we are working towards creating this product-mentorship structure,” Carrique said. “We are also creating resources about product and we’re starting to aggregate news product resources that can help professionals evangelize in their own newsrooms, but also that can help educators to share and start planting the seed of product thinking for the leaders of tomorrow.”</p>",

        "title": "Which news audiences are underserved?",
        "link": "https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/08/which-news-audiences-are-underserved/",
        "description": "<p>The authors write: “Findings indicate that Philadelphia’s news media system underserves communities with lower levels of income and education and that this structural gap generates a measurable gap in the provision of news content meeting the critical information needs of these communities.”</p>\n<p>The researchers point to a few caveats: their findings are limited to a subset of news outlets in greater Philadelphia, and they could not measure some demographic variables for the city’s major TV affiliates. But the general finding is still highly significant: the data “paint a multi-dimensional portrait of Philadelphia’s media system that strongly suggests that differences in audience size and staffing levels, ownership structures (commercial vs. noncommercial), and format (print vs. television vs. digital-only) together work to underserve socioeconomically marginalized populations.”</p>\n<p>What’s more, their results point to a possible concern — one warranting further research — about what they call “digital news deserts.” These are situations where “online-only outlets devote their already small staffs to reaching the same higher socioeconomic audiences served by large, legacy outlets and online-only outlets reaching lower socioeconomic audiences lack the capacity to significantly change this broader trend.”</p>\n<p>As for the news content provided, the researchers found that more affluent and older audiences tended to receive proportionally more Covid-19 coverage, while less affluent, less educated, and younger audiences encountered a stronger emphasis on breaking-news crime coverage.</p>\n<p>Finally, on the question of whether ownership has an impact on critical information needs, the study finds that “public-funded and nonprofit media produce more COVID-19 coverage relative to crime stories than their commercial counterparts.” In particular, the authors point out that hedge fund ownership, which has been criticized for a “vulture capitalism” approach that drains journalism resources for profit rather than public service, and other forms of private investment are associated with low ratios of pandemic vs. crime coverage.</p>\n<p>In all, these findings may not be all that surprising — and yet they provide important empirical weight to arguments that there are concerning inequalities in news provision that need attention. More concerning still, these results suggest that such gaps and disparities can emerge even in metropolitan areas with “robust and thriving” media systems like Philadelphia’s.</p>\n<p></p><p></p>\nResearch roundup\n<p>“Journalism as historical repair work: addressing present injustice through the second draft of history” by Nikki Usher and Matt Carlson in Journal of Communication.</p>\n<p>American journalism’s history of racism and exclusion is a long and ugly one, and against the backdrop of recent racial justice protests and reforms, many publications have apologized for and revisited the injustices done by their historical coverage (or sometimes lack thereof). Some Southern newspapers began interrogating their own racist pasts in the 2000s, but the number and depth of these apologies has accelerated in recent years.</p>\n<p>Usher and Carlson take a deep dive into these re-interrogations, dubbing them “second draft of history” journalism and examining three prominent cases at The New York Times (The 1619 Project), the Los Angeles Times, and The Kansas City Star. Second draft of history journalism, they argue, is set apart from other journalistic attempts to revisit the past and shape collective memory by being “deliberate and explicit in its effort to address past harms in the public record” — a more advocacy-oriented approach that challenges journalism’s dominant mode of presentism and neutrality.</p>\n<p>Usher and Carlson identify four components of second draft of history journalism: discursive consciousness (a belief that discourses have power to shape reality), moral consciousness (a belief that ideas and practices that were once considered acceptable now aren’t), institutional consciousness (a sense of collective responsibility for these moral failings as an organization), and past-orientation. They show how each of their three case studies embody these characteristics while ranging in approach from active (re-reporting the past) to reflective (looking inward at the organization’s failings).</p>\n<p>They find places where these kinds of components of second draft of history journalism clash with journalistic norms of objectivity and smoothing over past oversights rather than highlighting them. But on the whole, they find that this emergent practice is aiming to accomplish one of the same primary tasks that virtually all of journalism is doing — casting itself (in this case, by “repairing” the past) as a legitimate authority to help society define reality.</p>\n<p>“Questioning fact-checking in the fight against disinformation: An audience perspective” by Maria Kyriakidou, Stephen Cushion, Ceri Hughes, and Marina Morani in Journalism Practice.</p>\n<p>Journalistic fact-checking has waxed and waned in popularity over the past decade, alternatively being celebrated as a check on political obfuscation and pilloried as an ineffectual default to moderatism. Researchers have published dozens of studies aiming to determine precisely how useful fact-checking is, with mixed and nuanced results. The upshot: Fact-checking can help correct mistaken political beliefs, but with a lot of limiting factors — audiences’ pre-existing beliefs, ideology, and knowledge; and fact-checkers’ truth scales, equivocal rulings, and reliance on campaign claims. In particular, conservatives tend to be more resistant to fact-checking than liberals and progressives.</p>\n<p>But there are a couple of key limitations in many of the existing studies on fact-checking, which Kyriakidou and her colleagues at Wales’ Cardiff University identified. They’re heavy on the U.S. context, with its low media trust and highly politicized opinions about the media. And they overwhelmingly rely on experiments, which rarely take into account how people encounter fact-checking in their daily lives.</p>\n<p>Kyriakidou &amp; Co. sought to fill in these gaps with a study of U.K. news consumers through 14 focus groups and two qualitative surveys, gauging their attitudes toward, and practical use of, fact-checking operations. First, the bad news: Participants rarely used — and were seldom even familiar with — the fact-checking operations of major U.K. news organizations like the BBC and Channel 4. They saw fact-checking as something they did themselves — “independent research” that only came into play on occasional issues that greatly interested them. For many, professional fact-checking just wasn’t on the radar.</p>\n<p>But there was good news, too. Participants were quite amenable to idea of fact-checking, especially in broadcast television. There was little partisan gap in these attitudes, as many consumers saw it as a necessary check against lying politicians. And when focus groups were shown examples of fact-checking, they clearly preferred it to a non-fact-checked version of the same claim. The researchers concluded that in this (non-American) media environment, one key may simply be greater awareness: “for fact-checking to play the revolutionary role imparted to it by practitioners and academics alike, it needs greater visibility.”</p>\n<p>“Protesting the protest paradigm: TikTok as a space for media criticism” by Ioana Literat, Lillian Boxman-Shabtai, and Neta Kligler-Vilenchik in The International Journal of Press/Politics.</p>\n<p>We’ve looked in a couple of past issues at some of the fascinating recent research on the protest paradigm — the notion that journalists often delegitimize protests and marginalize protesters by emphasizing conflict and relying on official sources. But of course, in a media environment defined by the ability to post and critique media content for oneself and connect with like-minded audiences, mainstream journalists don’t get the ability to unilaterally define protests in the public’s mind.</p>\n<p>That kind of remixing and interrogating news coverage is happening continually on TikTok, especially in the wake of prominent protests. Literat and her colleagues wanted to see how TikTok is used as a space for this kind of personal media criticism of protest coverage by comparing videos around 2020’s Black Lives Matter protests and the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.</p>\n<p>The authors were clear that they didn’t consider these equivalent events — one a protest of racial injustice and the other an insurrection aimed at undermining democracy. But they provided a useful contrast to note how a platform’s tools, styles, and logic could be used to critique media protest coverage in both pro-social and anti-democratic ways.</p>\n<p>In a qualitative analysis of 115 top TikTok videos (plus the thousands of comments on them), Literat and her colleagues found some particular TikTok-based practices, including annotating news coverage with TikTok’s editing features and distinct visual grammar, and providing footage from among protesters and positioning it as a challenge to media narratives. They concluded that TikTok does provide users new ways to counter established media narratives of protests, but not always for socially beneficial purposes. “TikTok may be democratizing the act of media criticism,” they wrote, “but it does so for both democratic and non-democratic ends.”</p>\n<p>“The role of news media knowledge for how people use social media for news in five countries” by Anne Schulz, Richard Fletcher, and Rasmus Kleis Nielsen in New Media &amp; Society.</p>\n<p>If you’ve spent much time reading about and discussing misinformation and disinformation over the past several years, you’ve heard (or talked about) news literacy as a key tool for fighting it. There’s been some research indicating that, indeed, news literacy can be effective in helping people identify and resist disinformation and conspiracy theories.</p>\n<p>But beyond disinformation, our knowledge of the influence of news literacy on people’s actual news consumption is rather thin. Schulz and her colleagues helped elaborate one dimension of this relationship with their study on its role in how people use social media as a news source.</p>\n<p>Schulz and her co-authors focused on news media knowledge, which is the “head-knowledge” element of news literacy (the other being the ability to assert control over one’s relationship with news). Using a large international 2018 survey, they looked at how social media fit in with other dimensions of news consumption and how people determined what news was worth their time on social media.</p>\n<p>The results were quite similar across the five countries they examined (the U.K., Spain, Germany, Sweden, and the U.S.). People with greater news media knowledge were more likely to use social media for news, but less likely to use it as their main source. They also were more likely to use a variety of cues in determining news’ importance on social media, such as photos, headlines, news brands, or the person who shared the story. They were less likely, though, to be influenced by the number likes, comments, or shares a story had.</p>\n<p>The takeaway: Contrary to prevailing public opinion, people who know more about how the news is made understand that social media actually can be a useful news source, but they’re more careful to combine with other sources of information and diligently evaluate the news they see there.</p>\n<p>“Attacking the gatekeepers: A survey experiment on the effects of elite criticism on the media” by Patrick F.A. Van Erkel and Karolin Soontjens in International Journal of Communication.</p>\n<p>Criticizing the news media has been a central part of the communication strategy of politicians for about a half-century at this point. It typically has two intended targets: the news media itself, as a way to pressure journalists into friendlier coverage (what media critic Jay Rosen has called “working the refs”), and the public, as a way to inoculate audiences against negative coverage.</p>\n<p>Politicians and scholars have tended to assume that such attacks are quite effective — politicians, in continuing to use them, and scholars, in flagging them as democratically dangerous. But Van Erkel and Soontjens posed a question that hasn’t been tested as often as you might think: Do those attacks actually work?</p>\n<p>Their answer: Yes, sort of. They used a survey experiment in Belgium (a country with relatively high trust in media) to test the effect of hypothetical tweets by political leaders criticizing a public-service broadcaster’s news item. Tweets calling the broadcaster biased did lead audiences to perceive it as more biased, if the politician was in the participant’s favored party.</p>\n<p>Which makes sense, of course. But those tweets didn’t affect people’s trust in the outlet, nor did they lead people to see the news media as a whole as biased. When politicians criticized the broadcaster as inaccurate, it had no effect at all. So, Van Erkel and Soontjens concluded, politicians can feed like-minded citizens’ perception of a media outlet as hostile, but trust, as well as people’s perceptions of the news media as a whole, take more than just a few tweets to dislodge. (Though a massive, years-long campaign may exert rather more force.)</p>\n<p></p>Photo of a gap in Chahkouh Canyon by Farnoosh Abdollahi used under a Creative Commons license.<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>Back in February, I wrote about some remarkable twists and turns in Australian media law, which is weirdly where much of the Western world has been looking for ideas lately. One of those was particularly threatening to news organizations and other online publishers because it threatened the fundamental atomic unit of the internet: the link.</p>\n<p>A lawsuit named Defteros v. Google argued that a website could defame someone without writing anything about them — or even knowing who they are. It was enough simply to link to another web page that contains defamatory content.</p>\n<p>As a principle, that’s pretty terrifying for an open internet. Every URL you link to becomes a potential liability timebomb. So it was a little stunning when the Supreme Court of Victoria endorsed it last summer, ruling that Google owed a Melbourne lawyer $40,000 for including an Australian newspaper’s article in its search results.</p>\n<p>Well, we have good news: Australia’s High Court — its SCOTUS — just reversed that decision, saying that the “provision of a hyperlink in the Search Result merely facilitated access to the…article and was not an act of participation in the bilateral process of communicating the contents of that article to a third party.” </p>\n<p>But linkers aren’t out of the woods yet.</p>\n<p></p><p></p>\n<p>This dispute all began, oddly enough, in the world of Melbourne organized crime. Between 1998 and 2010, there were 32 murders of underworld figures in Melbourne, the product of internecine warfare between groups with names like “The Honoured Society” and “The Sunshine Crew.” A lawyer named George Defteros had long represented underground figures, and in 2004, he was arrested and charged, alongside one of his clients, with conspiring to murder a rival gang leader.</p>\n<p>The day after his arrest, Melbourne daily The Age ran a story headlined “Underworld loses valued friend at court,” which, as a court later put it, “implied that Defteros crossed a line from professional lawyer for, to confidant and friend of, criminal elements.” (You can read the article in this court ruling. We can still link to court rulings, can’t we?)</p>\n<p>A year later, the charges against Defteros were dropped, and he restarted his legal career. In 2007, he complained to The Age about the article still being up, but the paper didn’t agree that it was defamatory, and Defteros didn’t sue them. He did, however, sue the author of the article and a colleague who had turned it into a chapter in their book on the Melbourne underworld — but they settled that case out of court in 2010. </p>\n<p>So no court had ever ruled that the article was defamatory. And it had never been taken down.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2016 — almost 12 years after The Age’s article was published. A lawyer working for Defteros formally asked Google to remove the story from its search results, writing:</p>\n<p></p>In 2007 the subject of this article, Mr George Defteros, sued the publisher in defamation in the Victorian (Australia) Law Courts. The article was found to be defamatory and the publisher settled the matter, paying a confidential settlement sum. It was a term of the settlement that the article be removed from the internet.<p></p>\n<p>(There are a lot of problems with all that. Defteros had not sued the publisher, The Age. The article had not been found to be defamatory “in the Victorian (Australia) Law Courts.” And The Age had not agreed to remove the article from the internet; indeed, that’s why it was still online more than a decade later.)</p>\n<p>Google responded to the request by asking for a copy of the court order that had declared it defamatory. Defteros’ lawyer replied that there was no such court order, because of the confidential settlement, but that The Age had conceded the article was defamatory and agreed to have it taken down. (The Age had, in fact, done neither of things.) Google said, essentially, that this wasn’t their problem to deal with: If you think an article in The Age is defaming you, you should try to get The Age to take it down. If The Age decides to take it down — or if a court orders them to — Google can remove it from its search results. </p>\n<p>Defteros did go back to The Age, but the newspaper still kept the story online. After a few more months, Defteros sued Google — not only for The Age’s article, but also for other content on the web Defteros objected to, including a Wikipedia article. And three weeks later, The Age finally took the story down.</p>\n<p></p><p></p>\n<p>There’s a lot there, so let’s bring it back to general principles. A Publisher made a web page about a Prominent Person on the Internet. Someone else — we’ll call them the Linker — made a link to that web page. Twelve years later, the Prominent Person tells the Linker that the Publisher’s web page is defamatory, even though no court has so ruled. The Prominent Person then sues the Linker because it didn’t immediately take down the web page on the Prominent Person’s word that it was defamatory. And a court says, yes, the Linker owes the Prominent Person $40,000 because linking to a web page “amounted to publication of the webpage.”</p>\n<p>That the Linker here is Google is a distraction. The Linker could be anyone — a random Facebook user, a news organization, a politician. Every Australian who shared a link to The Age article on social media is just as liable, under this theory, as Google here — if anything, even more so, since their sharing it was an active choice, not a list of links generated by a search engine. Can you imagine being held legally liable not just for your own words, but also for the complete contents of every web page you’ve ever linked to, anywhere online?</p>\n<p>The High Court of Australia’s decision, then, is a welcome relief. It ruled 5–2 that holding Google liable for the content of every web page on the internet is…a stretch. You can find the decision here; some highlights (emphases mine) follow. First, from the majority decision, co-written by Chief Justice Susan Kiefel and Justice Jacqueline Gleeson:</p>\n<p></p>The question of whether the appellant could be said to participate comes down to the assistance provided by the hyperlink to move to another webpage. This is not a strong basis for liability and it finds no support in existing authority in Australia or recent cases elsewhere. As observed in Crookes v Newton, a hyperlink is content-neutral. A search result is fundamentally a reference to something, somewhere else. Facilitating a person’s access to the contents of another’s webpage is not participating in the bilateral process of communicating its contents to that person. <p></p>\n<p></p>The aim or purpose of the appellant in making information universally accessible should not be confused with whether it is motivated to and does produce income by providing hyperlinks, conducting a business in that sense. Neither factor is relevant to whether there is a publication. That question focuses upon what the appellant in fact does.<p></p>\n<p>From Justice Stephen Gageler’s concurring opinion:</p>\n<p></p>The conclusion of the primary judge that Google was a publisher, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal, was instead based on the broad proposition — necessarily applicable to the results of all Google searches — that the inclusion of a hyperlink in a search result is enough for the provision of the search result to amount to active and voluntary participation by Google in the process by which the matter referenced in the hyperlink is published to a user of the Google search engine. Her Honour said that “provision of a hyperlinked search result is instrumental to the communication of the content of the webpage to the user”, that “[t]he Google search engine lends assistance to the publication of the content of a webpage on the user’s device, by enabling the user to enter a search query and, a few clicks later, to view content that is relevant to the user’s search”, and that “[t]he inclusion of a hyperlink within a search result naturally invites the user to click on the link in order to reach the webpage referenced by the search result.” I cannot accept a proposition of that breadth.<p></p>\n<p>Gageler also quotes Australian media lawyer Matthew Collins in his opinion:</p>\n<p></p>Hyperlinks are the synapses connecting different parts of the world wide web. Without hyperlinks, the web would be like a library without a catalogue: full of information, but with no sure means of finding it. Almost every web page contains hyperlinked information, so that content is endlessly connected to other content.<p></p>\n<p>Justices James Edelman and Simon Steward also co-authored a concurrence. They’re quite harsh (appropriately, to my mind) on Defteros’ lawyer’s initial statements to Google (“Each matter z above was false”; “The solicitor responded with more falsehoods”; “Again, none of that was true.”)</p>\n<p></p>Given that the appellant’s search engine must traverse trillions of webpages on billions of occasions each month, inferentially the appellant will have no actual knowledge of the content of those pages, save in exceptional circumstances. It will also, inferentially, and subject to exceptional circumstances, know nothing about: the authors of those webpages; why the webpages have been created; and whether the information they convey is accurate. Again, inferentially, and subject to exceptions, the appellant will know few specifics about the users of its search engine or their motivations for making particular searches.<p></p>\n<p>…it has been established for more than a century that in every instance a person must have an intention to communicate before they can be a publisher. The concept of intention in the tort of defamation is not a unique idea dreamed up by ingenious defamation lawyers. It has exactly the same meaning as the intention in other torts of strict liability such as trespass to land, trespass to goods, or false imprisonment. To “intend something is to intervene in the world to bring about a chosen consequence”…</p>\n<p>The Underworld article was not written by any employee or agent of the appellant; it was written by a reporter with no connection to the appellant, and published by an independent newspaper over which the appellant had no control or influence. The appellant did not in any way authorise the article to be written or published. And there was no submission that the appellant had ratified the communication of the article. Indeed, it was not suggested that the appellant had any prior knowledge of the existence of the article until February 2016, some 11 years after it first appeared in The Age. </p><p></p>\n<p>But there were also opinions from the two justices who ruled against Google, Patrick Keane and Michelle Gordon. They both argue that Google, legally speaking, “published” the article in The Age by including it in its search engine, and are thus liable for its contents. Keane:</p>\n<p></p>Google provided search results in response to users’ search queries. Those search results directed its users to The Age’s webpage containing the Underworld article. Through the hyperlinks provided by Google, users were thereby enabled to have direct and nearly instantaneous access to the Underworld article. All this occurred as Google intended by the operation of its search engine in accordance with its design and in the ordinary conduct of Google’s business. Google thereby participated in the publication of the Underworld article to a user of its search engine for the purposes of the law of defamation in Australia…<p></p>\n<p>Google’s search engine, and its component programs, are both designed by humans. They operate as they are intended to do in accordance with that design. That is so, even though the component processes of a Google search are fully automated and completed without human intervention. Further, while the Google search engine is not capable of evaluating the meanings conveyed by the words or images displayed on a webpage, including whether they are true, false or defamatory, human intervention can, and does, occur at the point of Google’s “legal removal” process.</p><p></p>\n<p>So if Google indexes everything on the web, he seems to be arguing, it should be held legally liable for, well, everything on the web. And so would any search engine — watch out, DuckDuckGo.</p>\n<p></p>…Google’s search engine generates results ranked in a specific order through the use of Google’s confidential and proprietary algorithms and methodology as the intended response to a query by Google’s users. Success for Google in its business of operating its search engine consists of its users clicking on a hyperlink because they are satisfied with Google’s response. This is as Google intends. To satisfy its users, Google ensures that its search engine is constantly learning from the large volumes of query data that it accumulates and processes: over 100 billion searches are made by its users every month, and of those more than 500 million each day have never been made before.<p></p>\n<p>…it cannot sensibly be denied that a person who aids another to comprehend defamatory matter does participate in the publication of that matter to that person. There is nothing novel in this: a person who reads a defamatory writing to a blind or illiterate person publishes that writing, just as a person who reads a newspaper article aloud over the radio publishes the article</p><p></p>\n<p>And here’s Gordon’s opinion, which to me seems to come from an alternate universe:</p>\n<p></p>The ranking algorithm uses various signals or clues to determine the order in which to display results to users. Those clues include another important rank called PageRank, which evaluates how often other webpages link to that webpage, and the “importance” of those linking webpages. Creation and continuous operation of that system is the antithesis of passivity.<p></p>\n<p>Google published the Underworld Article…Google intended to publish the Underworld Article in the sense that its conduct was active and voluntary. Google intentionally participated in, lent its assistance to, was instrumental in and contributed to the communication of the Underworld Article by identifying, indexing, ranking and hyperlinking it within the search result. It matters not that Google was unaware of the alleged defamatory content of the Underworld Article.</p>\n<p>…Google’s attempt to portray itself as passive has an air of unreality. Having taken action to obtain a commercial benefit by creating and operating a search engine that facilitates access to news articles, it cannot deny that it is involved in the publication of those news articles.</p><p></p>\n<p>Gordon also finds, astonishingly, that as soon as Google received that first takedown request from Defteros’ lawyer — the one, remember, where “each matter represented…was false” — “Google was therefore aware of the defamatory character of the Underworld Article.” (Wait — so as soon as someone tells you something is defamatory — even if no court has agreed! — you’re legally aware that it is defamatory?)</p>\n<p>She also — perhaps just to enrage me — finds that Google is legally liable for The Age’s article because Australia’s awful News Media Bargaining Code “underlines the objective common intention of Google and news outlets.” It’s an Aussie bad-idea twofer!</p>\n<p>Nothing in Keane or Gordon’s opinions, to my reading at least, does anything to differentiate this specific case from the broader universe of Things That Happen On The Internet. They don’t say anything like: Well, of course, making every search engine liable for the content of every web page ever published would be absurd — but this case is different because [x, y, and z]. They don’t argue that this liability is limited to search engines, as opposed to any random social media user who links to a news story. Gordon, in particular, rejects a string of Google defenses — that “its users had a ‘legitimate’ interest in” the story; the story’s subject “was of ‘considerable public interest'”; that it “was ‘published by a reputable news source'” — completely out of hand.</p>\n<p>Luckily, Keane and Gordon were the 2 in a 5–2 decision. And Australian libel and defamation law derives from the notoriously weak-for-publishers British system; I have a hard time imagining a U.S. court finding The Age liable for defamation in this case, much less a search engine that linked to an article. </p>\n<p>But this dodged bullet in Australia is a useful reminder of all the people who are eager to “open up” American libel law to make it easier to shut down critical press. It sometimes seems that reining-in-Big-Tech is the one bipartisan issue left in American politics. But if you want to make it easier to sue Big Tech over someone else’s speech, you’ve got to make sure you’re not also making it easier to sue everyone else.</p>\n<p></p>Photo of the High Court of Australia at night by Photoma* used under a Creative Commons license.<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>Most news outlets don’t organize basketball park takeovers. The Kansas City Defender is not like most outlets. </p>\n<p>Established in July 2021 by Ryan Sorrell, 27, who grew up in the greater Kansas City area, The Kansas City Defender team prides itself on doing more than just covering the community straddling the Kansas-Missouri state line. The Defender, a news and culture platform consciously rooted in the tradition of both the Black and the abolitionist press, also reaches an under-served audience of predominantly Black teenagers and young adults, across the greater Midwest, on social media.</p>\n<p>Sorrell is the Defender’s sole full-time staffer. He’s assisted by a part-time staff writer, a part-time senior cultural strategist, five interns, and four freelance contributors. Coordinating via digital communications in lieu of a physical newsroom, the close-knit team at The Defender publishes content about every day on at least one platform — whether it’s their website, email newsletter, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Facebook page, or YouTube channel. (Currently, the publication’s largest social platform is Instagram, where it has around 15,000 followers.)</p>\n<p>“There is a lot about traditional journalism that we are strongly against” — including insidious values of “objectivity” precluding community-engaged, liberatory journalism, Sorrell said. “Learning how to balance our radical rejection of many journalistic norms with our commitment to truth, accuracy, and accountability to our community is something that will be a continual learning process for us.”</p>\n<p>The site has seven sections: Business, politics, arts and culture, justice, Kansas City, world, and Propaganda Observer. A sampling of recent headlines: “The Future of Food: This KC Nonprofit’s Innovative Model is Bringing Fresh Food to Black Neighborhoods,” “Nelson Atkins Museum Under Fire for Displaying Stolen African Art,” “Missouri Waterpark Goes Viral for Racist Denial of Black Teenagers,” and “Kansas City Joins Nationwide Vigil For Rezwan Kohistani, Afghan Refugee Found Hung at Missouri High School.”</p>\n\n @kansascitydefender <p></p>\n<p>Summit Waves in Lee's Summit, Missouri under fire for \"Jim Crow era\" rxcism.</p>\n<p> ♬ original sound – kcdefender </p>\n\n<p> </p>\nAn abolitionist approach to media making and community building\n<p>Staff began organizing the basketball park run in June, about a month after The Defender received racist hate mail. It marked the organization’s first major community event.</p>\n<p>“It was a lot of people’s first time hearing about our organization,” Sorrell said.</p>\n<p>A basketball park run is a coordinated gathering at a basketball court, enabling large numbers of people to play or spectate as hoopers show off handles and sharpshooting abilities in competitive full-court contests. This one took place at Ryan Stokes Memorial Court. Ryan Stokes, an unarmed 24-year-old Black man, was killed by a Kansas City police officer in 2013. </p>\n<p>“We had his mom bless the court and say a few words about Ryan before the takeover started,” Sorrell said. For the event, The Defender partnered with Operation Liberation, an abolitionist Kansas City nonprofit that works to bail Black people out of jail and coordinates mutual aid.</p>\n\n  <p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p><p></p>\n<p>A post shared by KC Defender (@kansascitydefender)</p>\n\n\n<p> </p>\n<p>“We had absolutely no police or security presence, and had zero incidents of violence,” The Defender noted in its own coverage of the event. “This reinforced our belief as an Abolitionist news outlet that police are not necessary to keep our communities safe, and that abolition is about the presence of community and life affirming services to create safety, rather than relying on police overseers.”</p>\n<p>Sorrell sees The Defender as working in and retrofitting the traditions of the 19th-century abolitionist press and the Black press — lineages steeped in movement journalism and community media that the Gen Z-filled crew in Kansas City seeks to carry forward.</p>\n<p>“To us, as abolitionist Ruth Wilson Gilmore says, abolition is about presence, not absence,” Sorrell said. “We do advocate against the racist function of policing, [but] we focus equally on being present in the community, doing poetry nights, basketball park takeovers, and other community-building, life-affirming activities.” For instance, The Defender did a piece on the top 10 artists in Kansas City this year. “The cultural side of our work is very important to us,” Sorrell said. “A lot of people are far more interested in the cultural side than they are things like hard news.”</p>\nCommunity organizing en route to Black-centered digital news and culture\n<p>Joshua Taylor, 27, the senior cultural producer at The Defender, helped make the basketball park takeover happen. </p>\n<p>Taylor grew up with Sorrell. Prior to their collaboration on the startup, they co-founded a community organization called Black Rainbow after the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020.</p>\n<p>“We started to see how important it was to control the narrative of a lot of the things that we were doing on the ground with the Black Rainbow organization,” Taylor said.</p>\n<p>“The Black press was a tool for survival, and a radical tool for resistance,” Sorrell told me. “Unlike white media, it never purported to exist in an objective vacuum or to adhere to some theoretical values and principals that mostly non-Black people created. It existed to communicate essential information to the Black community and to create collective identity, such as when Ida B. Wells reported on local lynchings, and denounced the state response and complicity in them. Or when the Chicago Defender said ‘When the white fiends come to the door to kill you, shoot them down. When the white mob comes, take at least one with you.’ Our editorials have not been quite as incendiary, but they are in similar spirit.”</p>\nGrant funding and ambition get the Defender going\n<p>Sorrell had no professional journalism experience prior to launching The Defender, but as a student at Loyola University, he ran a publication called The Black Tribune, focused on social advocacy; after graduation, at the Fleishman Hillard PR firm in Chicago, Sorrell said he learned more about shaping story angles and targeting audiences.</p>\n<p>For awhile at the Defender, he flew solo — writing articles, producing social media-oriented content, building the publication’s profile online, and popularizing the platform among Black adolescents and young adults in the area. This year, The Defender received a $25,000 grant from Indiegraf.</p>\n<p>The Defender also has interns this year. “I was an editor for my school newspaper, and there [were] plenty of times in which I wanted to speak on certain topics that were, literally, directly affecting our school — racism, xenophobia, all types of stuff,” Christjin Bell, 17, who graduated high school and began an internship at The Defender this year, said. “I couldn’t do it, wasn’t able to — not because it was a school publication, but because they felt it was too taboo, or it was too controversial, to speak upon.”</p>\n<p>In response to a slew of racist events that took place at her school this past year — including the circulation of a petition to reinstate slavery — Bell and her best friend, who is now also a Defender intern, organized a walkout. The students’ direct action put them in contact with Sorrell, who covered the story for The Defender.</p>\n<p>In addition to making videos for the outlet’s TikTok and Instagram pages, Bell contributed to The Defender piece, “This is what students are saying about white-washed history and censorship in schools.” Bell wrote about the way Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy is now used to demonize radical politics despite King’s own radicalism. She also recorded an interview with a school board candidate.</p>\n<p>“The thing I’m most proud of is our education coverage,” Sorrell said. “We’ve had at least four or five education stories that have [become] national stories.” CNN, for instance, picked up the story on the petition to reinstate slavery. “At least five Black student unions formed as a result of our coverage, and our coverage has also led to student sit-ins,” Sorrell said.</p>\n<p>Bell recorded an Instagram video report in February interrogating the local law enforcement narrative about the suspicious death of Asia Maynard, a young Black woman from Kansas City, and The Defender published an article about what transpired a few days later; The Grio, Complex, and Yahoo News picked up the story and credited The Defender with obtaining an original quote from Maynard’s cousin.</p>\n\n  <p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p><p></p>\n<p>A post shared by KC Defender (@kansascitydefender)</p>\n\n\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sorrell said he and his team use “a fluid set of criteria” to decide what qualifies as newsworthy, “but ultimately what matters is whether or not a story is of significance to Black people….Our coverage is often actionable, and tells people how to take action or who to get connected with.”</p>\n<p>They also avoid bombarding readers and viewers with primarily distressing stories, which Sorrell called “a form of psychological warfare against Black people.” He added, “That’s why integrating positive stories is so important to us. That’s why we do things like Black Student of the Month, and highlight Black athletes who are doing good things in the community.”</p>\n\n  <p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p><p></p>\n<p>A post shared by KC Defender (@kansascitydefender)</p>\n\n\n<p> </p>\n<p>And they’re not opposed to making the news instead of just reporting on it, or to contributing to the culture instead of simply covering it. </p>\n<p>Bringing people together to play basketball and inviting a hooper boasting a big online presence and a sizable following on social media was one way to do that. Taylor invited Slim, otherwise known as Slim Reaper, an influencer with game who came from Florida for the park run. Taylor pitched Slim’s manager and shared some numbers suggesting the event would offer exposure while benefiting the Kansas City community. </p>\n<p>“He hit me back — I think the same day, pretty much immediately — and we kind of started planning the whole thing out,” Taylor said.</p>\n<p>Despite injuring his ankle a few days before, he felt compelled to take the court during the takeover too, embodying The Defender’s mission of immersion and direct engagement with the people the outlet serves the best he could on a compromised leg.</p>\n<p>“I was really happy, and I still played the second day just because I’m just like, ‘I’m a basketball player. I got to play.’ But, I mean, I found a couple threes,” he said. Slim later posted video from the event and thanked The Defender for hosting it.</p>\n<p>Sorrell said he studies reports on media trends. “I got the Nieman predictions last year, and I was just like, ‘Wow, looks like we’re actually doing a lot of these things already,'” he said.</p>\n<p>“I think that from our very beginning, we’ve had a radical innovative vision, and I think people should continue to watch us,” Sorrel said. “There’s a lot more that we want to do and that we plan on doing, too.”</p>\n<p></p><p>James Anderson is from Illinois but now lives in Riverside, California.

        "description": "<p>The past two election cycles have seen an explosion of attention given to “echo chambers,” or communities where a narrow set of views makes people less likely to challenge their own opinions. Much of this concern has focused on the rise of social media, which has radically transformed the information ecosystem.</p>\n<p>However, when scientists investigated social media echo chambers, they found surprisingly little evidence of them on a large scale — or at least none on a scale large enough to warrant the growing concerns. And yet, selective exposure to news does increase polarization. This suggested that these studies missed part of the picture of Americans’ news consumption patterns. Crucially, they did not factor in a major component of the average American’s experience of news: television.</p>\n<p>To fill in this gap, I and a group of researchers from Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania and Microsoft Research tracked the TV news consumption habits of tens of thousands of American adults each month from 2016 through 2019. We discovered four aspects of news consumption that, when taken together, paint an unsettling picture of the TV news ecosystem.</p>\nTV trumps online\n<p>We first measured just how politically siloed American news consumers really are across TV and the web. Averaging over the four years of our observations, we found that roughly 17% of Americans are politically polarized — 8.7% to the left and 8.4% to the right —  based on their TV news consumption. That’s three to four times higher than the average percentage of Americans polarized by online news.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the percentage of Americans polarized via TV ranged as high as 23% at its peak in November 2016, the month in which Donald Trump was elected president. A second spike occurred in the months leading into December 2018, following the “blue wave” midterm elections in which a record number of Democratic campaign ads were aired on TV. The timing of these two spikes suggests a clear connection between content choices and events in the political arena.</p>\nStaying in TV echo chambers\n<p>Besides being more politically siloed on average, our research found that TV news consumers are much more likely than web consumers to maintain the same partisan news diets over time: After six months, left-leaning TV audiences are 10 times more likely to remain segregated than left-leaning online audiences, and right-leaning audiences are 4.5 times more likely than their online counterparts.</p>\n<p>While these figures may seem intimidating, it is important to keep in mind that even among TV viewers, about 70% of right-leaning viewers and about 80% of left-leaning viewers do switch their news diets within six months. To the extent that long-lasting echo chambers do exist, then, they include only about 4% of the population.</p>\nNarrow TV diets\n<p>Partisan segregation among TV audiences goes even further than left- and right-leaning sources, we found. We identified seven broad buckets of TV news sources, then used these archetypes to determine what a typical unvaried TV news diet really looks like.</p>\n<p>We found that, compared to online audiences, partisan TV news consumers tend not to stray too far from their narrow sets of preferred news sources. For example, most Americans who consume mostly MSNBC rarely consume news from any other source besides CNN. Similarly, most Americans who consume mostly Fox News do not venture beyond that network at all. This finding contrasts with data from online news consumers, who still receive sizable amounts of news from outside their main archetype.</p>\nDistilling partisanship\n<p>Finally, we found an imbalance between partisan TV news channels and the broader TV news environment. Our observations revealed that Americans are turning away from national TV news generally in substantial numbers — and crucially, this exodus is more from centrist news buckets than from left- or right-leaning ones. Within the remaining TV news audience, we found movement from broadcast news to cable news, trending toward MSNBC and Fox News.</p>\n<p>Together, these trends reveal a counterintuitive finding: Although the overall TV news audience is shrinking, the partisan TV news audience is growing. This means that the audience as a whole is in the process of being “distilled” — remaining TV viewers are growing increasingly partisan, and the partisan proportion of TV news consumers is on the rise.</p>\nWhy it matters\n<p>Exposure to opposing views is critical for functional democratic processes. It allows for self-reflection and tempers hostility toward political outgroups, whereas only interacting with similar views in political echo chambers makes people more entrenched in their own opinions. If echo chambers truly are as widespread as recent attention has made them out to be, it can have major consequences for the health of democracy.</p>\n<p>Our findings suggest that television — not the web — is the top driver of partisan audience segregation among Americans. It is important to note that the vast majority of Americans still consume relatively balanced news diets.</p>\n<p>However, given that the partisan TV news audience alone consumes more minutes of news than the entire online news audience, it may be worth devoting more attention to this huge and increasingly politicized part of the information ecosystem.</p>\n<p></p><p>Homa Hosseinmardi is an associate research scientist in computational social science at the University of Pennsylvania.

        "description": "<p>So, every morning, I turn to the puzzles. First, I solve Wordle. Then, I open up the Spelling Bee. My goal is to find the pangram and every possible word I can before I open up the New York Times app and read the daily Spelling Bee article for the hints. I go through the hints listed in the article, counting how many I’ve found and comparing them to how many I have yet to find. This is when I start guessing at words I might not know, based on the alphabetical order the hints are listed in. This has led to many mornings on my porch muttering the alphabet song as my coffee gets cold. It’s a tiny treasure hunt and the gems are words. And finding a hidden word in that circle of letters is a jolt of jouissance. And then, my brain exhausted, I open up the comments at the bottom of the daily Spelling Bee article, where commenters list their own hints.</p>\n<p>The comments of the New York Times Spelling Bee are a world unto themselves. They are often pedantic and sometimes exuberant and very often bitchy. “Why isn’t tittilate a word?” someone asks. “Try spelling it correctly,” another replies.</p>\n<p>But the conversation is all about words — a fastidious melodrama of the lowest stakes. I imagine them as lonely retirees in Arizona, disaffected teens, exhausted mothers sipping coffee at 4 a.m. with a baby in a bouncy seat. I imagine two people, one widower, one divorcée, meeting in the comments after fighting about whether “adit” should be accepted as a word in the puzzle and then falling in love. A community of people looking for order in a world spinning out of control.</p>\n<p>Last week in the comments, someone with the user name “Aha Delayed” thanked the Spelling Bee community. “Nine months ago,” they wrote, “my wife was diagnosed with cancer and suddenly our lives became very small and very simple, her fighting a great fight and me nursing here while giving our son as much normalcy as possible. And within that hibernation, I discovered this bee and its hive, a gentle daily distraction at a large and harrowing time. Now, despite feeling weaker than ever, she has proven stronger than ever and (fingers firmly crossed) beaten it. And with antipodean springtime afoot, and health returned, and our doors opening to the world again, I’ll set this game aside and return to past patterns. But before I do, a very large and sincere thanks to all those excellent erudite regulars (Liz and Carol and Steve and Michael and many more besides) who’ve proven to be so nice a continuity in a time of uncertainties. Wishing you all well and with the nene-finding and clue-offering and wisdom (both wordy and worldly) sharing, and cheers again. It really has meant a lot.”</p>\n<p>“Continuity in a time of uncertainties.” Of course, a person drawn to word puzzles would so perfectly express their power and meaning.</p>\n<p>In his book Vermeer in Bosnia, Lawrence Weschler writes of a judge at The Hague who, day after day, listened to accounts of the horrific atrocities perpetrated in Bosnia. When Weschler asks the judge how he copes, the judge replies that as often as he could, he would go to the Mauritshuis museum and look at the Vermeers. </p>\n<p>Born in 1632, Johannes Vermeer lived in the Netherlands during a war-torn era. He died in 1675, deeply in debt and mostly unknown. He began his career painting vast biblical scenes but eventually painted pictures only of placid domestic life, made alive through the contrast of light and shadow. He depicted mostly women in what would have otherwise been unattended moments. Weschler writes, “For, of course, when Vermeer was painting those images, which for us have become the very emblem of peacefulness and serenity, all Europe was Bosnia (or had only just been): awash in incredibly vicious wars of religious persecution and proto-nationalist formation.”</p>\n<p>I learned about Weschler through Rebecca Solnit’s beautiful book Orwell’s Roses, which is about the author George Orwell’s preoccupation with his garden. She writes of Weschler and Vermeers and war that “human beings need reinforcement and refuge, that pleasure does not necessarily seduce us from the tasks at hand but can fortify us. The pleasure that is beauty, the beauty that is meaning, order, calm.”</p>\n<p>Solnit connects this to Orwell’s penchant for retreat into domestic spaces, where a disorderly world can be set right by pruning and weeding and washing.</p>\n<p>I know a woman who used to be a politician. She, like Orwell, has turned to roses. At first during a fraught re-election campaign, which she lost. And then, during a bitter primary. She lost again. They were frustrating losses, the kind that comes from the scorched-earth politics of our era. Losses that felt inevitable and are somehow more devastating because of that. Because you know, no matter how good you are, how perfectly you perform, you will still fail. And in women, perfection is faulty and imperfection is unforgivable. I know this truth deep in my soul. But the natural world is more forgiving. Her roses are beautiful. Elegantly cultivated, meticulously cared for. She knows all their names and varieties and how to propagate them. </p>\n<p>I once sent her Alexander Chee’s essay on roses, and she had a quote from it inscribed on two small plaques — one for her and one for me. </p>\n<p>“Roses…the more they are cut back, the faster they grow, and the stronger they are. I understand, as I read this, that I have found my role models.”</p>\n<p>Last month, my sister left the country. Because of a medical complication that arose from receiving the wrong blood type during emergency surgery, my sister isn’t sure if she can have children. It’s likely her body will reject the baby, the new blood in her body turning against the blood type of the fetus. A war within her that could kill her. She’s had an abortion. When she called to tell me about the abortion, I was relieved. I want my sister to live. And not just live, I want her to thrive. I don’t just want minimal survival for her. I want everything for her. I think about how this country is not a place she can thrive. Where her body is at risk. She left the country last month, and now she’s drinking wine in Rome and sending me updates about her exploits. </p>\n<p>I think that’s what this fight is all about. Not just about eking out a minimal existence, but how we all deserve wine in Rome. Anarchist and political activist Emma Goldman once said, “I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody’s right to beautiful radiant things.”</p>\n<p>Some days, I feel as if I am living and working so desperately. The world seems so perilous and fraught, and I’m meat and flesh and nerve endings trying to find a way through it all. And life, if it is worth living, isn’t all tirades and rage against the machine. It’s wine in Rome, it’s roses, it’s puzzles.</p>\n<p>And so, when I wake up, I make coffee and I sit on my porch, my dogs at my feet, and for a moment, I do my little word puzzles and stare into a world where there is order, and where, just for a moment, I can find the words to make everything right.</p>\n<p></p><p>Lyz Lenz is a former columnist for The Cedar Rapids Gazette and the author of Belabored: A Vindication of the Rights of Pregnant Women and God Land: A Story of Faith, Loss and Renewal in Middle America.

        "description": "Atlanta Braves 2020 first round pick and top pitching prospect Jared Shuster delivers a pitch for the Rome Braves | Image Credits: Mills Fitzner\n    \n\n  <p>Jared Shuster blew past his previous Triple-A best with his first double digit strikeout game at the level</p> <p>The Gwinnett Stripers are again the lone representative on the Atlanta Braves system in action, but they gave us a lot to cheer for in lieu of the recent struggles of the big league club. Jared Shuster put up one of the best outings of his career to lead Gwinnett to victory and Victor Vodnik rounded that out by continuing his strong work out of the bullpen. </p>\n(67-76) Gwinnett Stripers 4, (71-74) Memphis Redbirds 3\n<p>Box Score</p>\n\nTaylor Motter, 2B: 1-4, 2B, .261/.355/.592\nRyan Casteel, C: 1-4, HR, 4 RBI, .216/.305/.489\nGreyson Jenista, RF 2-4, 2B, .207/.272/.382\nJared Shuster, SP: 7 IP, 2 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 1 BB, 10 K, 3.74 ERA\nVictor Vodnik, RP: 1 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 3 K, 3.04 ERA\n\n<p>The Stripers weren’t spectacular with the bats on Friday evening, but came through when it mattered and scored a close win over the Redbirds. Unfortunately for all of us (mostly me), Justyn-Henry Malloy was taking a breather tonight, so there wasn’t anything to speak of prospect-wise on the offensive end. Fortunately, Jared Shuster made up for that and more, but we’ll get to him in a bit. Gwinnett was no hit through four innings in this one before Tyler White broke through first with a single to lead off the fifth inning. Greyson Jenista also had one of his two hits in this inning, but both runners were stranded and Gwinnett fell behind when Memphis scored two runs in the bottom of the fifth. </p>\n<p>The third time through the order the Stripers finally turned it on, but it took until there were two outs in the sixth inning for them to step up. Taylor Motter ringed a two out double to get a rally started and two walks followed to bring up the powerful Ryan Casteel with the bases loaded. Casteel continued his fantastic season by ripping a line drive home run high off of the berm in left field for a go ahead grand slam. This was Casteel’s team-leading 17th home run this season, which he has done in just 67 games played. Greyson Jenista doubled behind Casteel, but the scoring was over and he was stranded when Joe Dunand struck out to end the inning. Those five hits in the fifth and sixth innings were the only ones Gwinnett managed in the game and it was up to the pitching staff to hold the Redbirds offense to fewer than four runs. </p>\n<p>Jared Shuster has been solid if a bit underwhelming since his promotion to Gwinnett, but all of that changed Friday night when he blew past his level-bests to put up a career night. Coming into this past start Shuster had only pitched into the sixth inning twice in nine Triple-A games and maxed out at four strikeouts. After a first inning that featured a ground out, a walk, and a double play it seemed like business as usual, but over the final six innings of his start he started piling up the strikeouts. Following that one out walk in the first inning Shuster retired ten straight batters and with five of them coming on strikeouts already had his best strikeout total in a Stripers uniform. Home runs have been Shuster’s plague and he couldn’t escape it in this outing, but the two-run shot in the fifth inning only temporarily marred his night. Following that home run Shuster retired another nine batters in a row with another five coming on strikeouts to give him his first double-digit strikeout night in a Gwinnett uniform. In addition to the strikeouts Shuster was a ground ball machine, recording nine more ground ball outs in the game. Only three balls in the game went in the air: a third inning pop out to the shortstop, a soft line drive single to lead off the fifth inning, and that home run. Hard contact was hard to come by against him and unfortunately the one time Memphis did square him up they made him pay. Shuster perhaps didn’t even use his full tank, leaving after a full seven innings at just 85 pitches.</p>\n<p>After Shuster’s brilliant night the Stripers bullpen had to protect a two-run lead for two innings, and Jay Jackson began that journey by allowing a solo home run to cut their advantage in half. Jackson then allowed a hit and a walk to put the go-ahead run on base before he managed to get it together and get a fly out and strike out to close out the ninth inning. Gwinnett turned to Victor Vodnik to close out the game in the ninth inning, and they had good reason to make that decision. Over his last six outings following his trip to the injured list Vodnik pitched 6 2⁄3 innings, struck out ten batters, and allowed only one run. Vodnik struck out the first batter of the inning looking, but Nolan Gorman netted a double against him that put the tying run in scoring position with one out. Vodnik responded by striking out the next two batters to close out a tight Friday night win. </p>\n<p>Next Game: 9/23 @ (71-74) Memphis RedBirds @ 3:05 PM ET</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>Every weekend when I sit down to write these, I cast my mind back over the previous week’s events, and it seems that there’s always something dramatic that’s happened. This week, in order or drama: I had a suspected minor heart attack, helped talked a man down from jumping off a bridge, and accidentally set off all of the smoke alarms in our three-storey house at 1am. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First things first: my hospital visit. I’ve written about it here, so I’ll just say that on Tuesday I ended up spending six hours having tests which revealed I had slightly elevated levels of Troponin. This is a protein released by the heart when it’s damaged. It can be impacted by intense exercise as well as other factors. It seems I’m OK, and have been told I can exercise as usual, but I’m taking it easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn’t far into a gentle run on Friday when I went past a man who was acting strangely on a bridge I was running over. Over the last few months, Zoë Rose has been sharing on LinkedIn what she’s learned from doing suicide prevention training, including asking a very direct question. So I stopped, and said, “you’re not thinking of jumping off there, are you?” The man, in his twenties, didn’t say “no”, so I stayed and talked to him for a good 20 minutes. His life story was horrific and he was very drunk, especially for 11 o’ clock in the morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked someone who happened to be taking a photo from the bridge to phone the police, and when they arrived, from both sides of the bridge, it turns out he was well known to them. I’m not sure whether he would have jumped without me being there, and I’m not sure if the drop would have done him much damage, but I’m glad that what Zoë shared meant I could help in a small way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The smoke alarm mini-drama just increased my tiredness levels. My son was a bit freaked out by a weird ‘chirping’ sound coming from downstairs. I’m not sure what he thought it was, but it was just our mains-powered dining room smoke alarm chirping to let us know that the backup battery was running out. I’m not sure whether it was because it was 1am but it seemed to take me a long time to figure out how to take the unit apart. I’m just pleased we happened to have a spare 9v battery in the cupboard. I’m changing the other seven during the daytime this week to prevent that happening again!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t believe in monarchy, and no-one was paying me to take the day off, so I worked through the extra Bank Holiday due to the Queen’s funeral. That being said, work has kind of taken a bit of a back seat due to the events recounted above. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I am glad we’ve managed to get sorted is to book accommodation for our first WAO in-person meetup just north of Amsterdam in January 2023. It will be the first time since before the pandemic, although I did see Laura and Anne IRL at The Badge Summit in Colorado last month!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than that I’ve been working across various WAO client projects, as well as helping out the Bonfire team. The latter have released a significant update to the Playground instance; I’ve recorded a Loom video giving a quick overview of how it’s going beyond microblogging to become a real federated app toolkit.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than that, I’ve been collaborating on a new email course called How to Unf*ck Your Organisation which brings together some of WAO’s tools and approaches to help with organisational strategy and architecture.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a significant birthday for Laura this weekend, and there’s a good chance she’ll read this, so Happy Birthday! 🥳</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next week, I’m working on WAO client work, some content design for the Bonfire website, responding to questions from NLnet around a bid we submitted, having a flu jab, and getting an MRI scan. And, of course, bracing myself for whatever drama life decides to throw at me…</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Header image: my Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga laptop, covered in stickers!</p>The post Weeknote 38/2022 first appeared on Open Thinkering.",

        "description": "<p>“Once the queen’s head is severed, he walks away. A sharp pang of appetite reminds him that it is time for a second breakfast, or perhaps an early dinner.”</p><p>These are the first two sentences of T​he Mirror and ​the Light, the third volume of Hilary Mantel’s ​trilogy about the life of Thomas Cromwell and the last book she published before she died on Thursday at the lamentably young age of 70. With masterly dispatch, she thrusts us into the middle of the action, tells us exactly where we are, and makes us gasp at a conjunction of things that we would never have thought could occupy the same moral universe—that is, decapitation and a second breakfast. But she makes them make sense together. Cutting off heads and a second morning meal are both prerogatives of the powerful in late-medieval England. I could have plucked just about any two lines out of her novels and shown that they do the same amount of work. That’s how efficient this writer was. That’s what we’ve lost.</p><p>We are inside the head of Cromwell, street urchin elevated to manager of, well, everything in the land, on behalf of the bloated, childish King Henry VIII. “Lord Cromwell is the government, and the church as well,” someone observes. He is also the satisfier of Henry’s lusts—his procurer, if you like. Cromwell has made a queen for Henry and killed that queen for Henry. Everyone knows how Anne Boleyn ended up. But only readers of the first two novels in the series know that Mantel invented an improbably tender, courteous Cromwell with a capacity for ethical reasoning unimaginable in the royals he moves among. But now blood spurts out of the queen’s neck, we are in the third act of the tragedy, and Mantel has added to the list of Cromwell’s powers the ability to turn his back on horror and think about food, as callow as a king.</p><p>How do you animate history like this? Historians can’t do it. Very few historical novelists can do it. In her memoir, Giving Up the Ghost, Mantel reveals the mystery of her method: “Eat meat. Drink blood,” she writes. “Rise in the quiet hours of the night and prick your fingertips and use the blood for ink.” You may be tempted to dismiss as hackneyed the notion of draining one’s veins for art, but then you discover that blood was the defining substance, the governing catastrophe, of Mantel’s life.</p><p>[Read: Hilary Mantel takes Thomas Cromwell down]</p><p>In her 20s, she developed a case of endometriosis severe enough to make her vomit and have so much pain in her limbs and organs that she couldn’t walk. But it went undiagnosed, and because no one understood what was wrong with her, she entered a psychiatric clinic. She was told not to write. Endometriosis is what used to be called a female complaint. One might call it menstruation run amok. The cells in the lining of the womb that usually bleed out during a period instead grow in other parts of the body—the pelvis, the bladder, the bowel—and bleed there, creating scar tissue and unbearable pain. “Infertility is a distinct possibility,” writes Mantel, and indeed, she would never have children. A hormonal condition associated with endometriosis induces migraines and, in her case, “the migraine aura that made my words come out wrong” and “morbid visions, like visitations, premonitions of dissolution.” Once Mantel received a proper diagnosis, she was put on medication that made her balloon. Thereafter, she recalls, she dwelled  in the shadow land of “fat-lady shops,” unable to shake off the “perception of most of the population, who know that overweight people are lazy, undisciplined slobs.”</p><p>What does endometriosis have to do with art? For Mantel, everything. She worked her experience until it became the corporeal substrate of her fiction. Her magnum opus is made of blood and female bodies. Whether a man’s blood is noble or base determines his identity and fate. The behavior of a woman’s reproductive organs may be the difference between life and death. There are many reasons Thomas Cromwell towers above contemporary literature, a demiurgic character on par with Hamlet, but one source of his authority is his uncommon (and admittedly anachronistic) attentiveness to the female condition.</p><p>He would appear to be alone among monarchists of his age in being repulsed by a social order that reduces queens—one of whom he loved before Henry swooped in and took her—to  sperm receptacles in the king’s service. It is through his visits to Catherine of Aragon, who never gave birth to a male heir who lived past infancy, that we observe just what it means ​for a queen to fail at her reproductive duties​. Replaced by Anne and confined to a remote castle, Catherine literally rots away from the inside, devoured by what seems to be some sort of abdominal cancer. Though Cromwell destroys Anne Boleyn, first he pities her when her body rejects the only princeling she ever produced and blood from the miscarriage forms a slick trail on the palace floor. Henry just wants to be rid of her.</p><p>“When women apes have their wombs removed, and are returned by keepers to the community, their mates sense it, and desert them,” writes Mantel in her memoir. “It is a fact of base biology; there is little kindness in the animal kingdom, and I had been down there with the animals, grunting and bleeding on the porter’s trolley. There would be no daughter.” No. But there would be what Hilary Mantel fashioned from her body instead, which was more than anyone could have asked for.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",

        "description": "Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>In his first week as a Yankee, Bader has put on a defensive clinic. </p> <p>It’s not too often that I get this excited about watching a Yankee play defense. Don’t get me wrong, it’s been a privilege watching Aaron Judge patrol right field for the last six seasons in pinstripes, but this is another level that not even Judge can rival. Harrison Bader may be the best outfield defender I’ve seen in my two decades of watching Yankees baseball. </p>\n<p>There was much talk about Bader’s defense upon the trade being announced. The numbers and eye test matched up for him too, leaving little room for any doubt about Bader’s knack for catching just about everything. After just a few games of watching him, I’m truly in awe of his level of understanding for how to attack any given fly ball, and how each baserunner’s speed plays a role in the decisions he makes. Typically it’s hard to say that defense from any player can be that big of a difference maker in the long run, but my goodness, there is no doubt in my mind that Bader’s defense is intangibly valuable. He’s that special and I’ll prove it to you by recapping some of the great plays he has already made.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t something you see every day. Bader ranged all the way from enter field to cut this ball off from hitting the wall. There is no doubt in my mind that this should have been Oswaldo Cabrera’s ball, but Bader was well aware of the fact that Cabrera is getting used to the position, and may not get a beat on it like he can. Yes, he let the ball carry a little far and wasn’t able to make an out per se, but if this ball gets to the wall it is without a doubt a triple. Also, if it wasn’t for Oneil Cruz’s blazing speed, it’s possible there could have been a play at the plate. </p>\n\n<p>There isn’t much to say here beyond that you can’t take a better route to this ball. If you’ve ever played the outfield before, you know this lone drive and the one right at you are the two hardest to read. You have to read the spin off the bat and know the hitter at the plate on top of relying on instincts. Bader has probably caught hundreds of line drives off the bat of Pham in batting practice back during their Cardinals days. Even though it was hit at 105 mph on a straight line, Bader had no problems running back, switching his feet while keeping his eye on the ball, and camping perfectly under it. </p>\n\n<p>As Yankee fans, we’ve been lucky witnessing Judge throw dots from any spot in right field, but you have to know it’s not a very common skill. It takes the proper foot work, read off the bat, and last few steps at the end right before you catch the ball to stay behind it and make the throw with balance. Devers made it easy by hitting it right at Bader, but what you do in these plays matter.</p>\n\n<p>This is in the ninth inning of a blowout game folks! This is how you make fans fall in love with you instantly. His ability to change direction with his feet is truly incredible. He knows when to spring, when to decelerate, and how to stay perfectly behind the ball. Most center fielders are drifting to this ball and throwing it with a pirouette. Not Bader. He takes a perfect route to it giving the runner no chance to advance.</p>\n\n<p>I’m genuinely giggling in happiness watching this clip back. Just sit back and enjoy. This is what we’ll get to see for the rest of the season, playoffs, and next year. Outside of early career Brett Gardner, I don’t think there is a valid comparison to Bader’s defense in the last 20 seasons, and even Gardy may not be in the same league as Bader. The combination of speed, reads, routes, footwork, and arm accuracy is something I will never get used to. There are great defenders, then there are the Harrison Bader’s of the world. </p>",

The firing surprised him, too. Expectations there were unrealistic. Moore always joked he was the only GM from Garden City Community College (he also graduated George Mason); the trend is toward Ivy Leaguers. Manager Mike Matheny, who doesn’t seem favored by players, would seem to be in peril now.</p>\n<p>Alex Duvall at Royals Farm Report is impressed with MJ Melendez’s walk rate.</p>\n<p>MJ’s walk rate is particularly important because his swing will probably never allow him to be a high batting average guy. He’s a big, powerful kid with a lot of loft in his swing. That’s exactly the way he should be. It’s just never going to lend itself towards a bunch of singles and thus a higher batting average. Melendez’ on-base value is going to come from his ability to draw a ton of walks, something he’s shown a knack for early in his big league career. Even if he only ever hits .240 on a regular basis, a 12% BB% should keep his OBP around .340 which can make him a 130+ wRC+ hitter when he starts hitting more home runs. That would put him up there with Vinnie Pasquantino as the best pure hitters on the team.</p>\n<p>Kevin O’Brien at Royals Reporter writes about some position storylines to watch for the Royals, like whether Michael A. Taylor or Drew Waters will be patrolling centerfield.d</p>\n\n<p>Taylor is certainly not a long-term piece for the Royals, but he does bring something positive to this organization. The former Washington National is posting a 1.6 fWAR this year, which is certainly valuable. In fact, Taylor’s fWAR is the third-best mark of Royals players with 200 or more plate appearances, according to Fangraphs.</p>\n<p>That being said, Waters does provide an interesting profile on both an offensive and defensive end, and that has carried over from Omaha to Kansas City, even if it is still a work in progress.</p>\n\n<p>Darin Watson at UL’s Toothpick looks at Moore’s complicated legacy.</p>\n<p>Inside the Royals gathers the writers for a roundtable to discuss the dismissal of Dayton Moore.</p>\n<p>Kayden Rhodes was given 24 hours to live, but 15 years later he threw out the first pitch at Kauffman Stadium, writes Vahe Gregorian.</p>\n<p>How the Guardians took control of the Central Division.</p>\n<p>Carlos Correa is finishing this season on a tear.</p>\n<p>Cardinals pitcher Ryan Helsley unleashes a 104 mph fastball, the fastest pitch of the year.</p>\n<p>Are quarterback wins a relevant stat?</p>\n<p>The U.S. Men’s National Team did not look good in a loss to Japan in a friendly this week.</p>\n<p>The dark secret behind those cute AI-generated animal images.</p>\n<p>Is swimming in ice water good for you?</p>\n<p>Would the 007 series be better if they changed James Bond with each film?</p>\n<p>Your song of the day is The Kinks with A Well Respected Man.</p>",

        "description": "<p>\"A blessing in disguise.\" Those words from a Democratic political consultant refer to the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, which he described as giving \"Democrats a renewed optimism about this year.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the court returned the question to the citizenry to determine whether there is a right to abortion in any given state. What happened next, though, is a bit curious: Most Democratic politicians, including President Joe Biden, are declaring that a woman alone should make any decision in consultation with her doctor — an absolute interpretation of the right that was not supported in Roe and that runs counter to the view of most voters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For that reason, when pressed, most candidates are steadfastly avoiding questions on any restrictions, including questions about late-term abortions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senate candidate Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) has adopted an absolute position that there should be no limits on a woman's right to abortion — far beyond anything in Roe or Casey — and has refused to address whether this would mean that a fully formed baby in the ninth month of pregnancy could be aborted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly (D) has been accused by her opponent, Attorney General Derek Schmidt (R), of opposing any restrictions on the right. But when asked by the media, Kelly has replied: “You know, I have never said that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question is what politicians on both sides have to say about specific restrictions and not just about the right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler on Thursday swatted down questions about late-term abortions as being \"disingenuous.\" Instead, he insisted these are questions involving \"painful, emotional and even moral decisions.\" They are. But they also involve the very legal questions addressed in past Supreme Court cases, including Gonzales v. Carhart, upholding Congress' right to ban late-term abortion techniques.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Kessler focused on whether late-term abortions are \"common,\" the issue is whether a woman has a constitutional right to late-term abortions. The answer to that question can help understand the meaning of this right and any balancing of interests recognized in cases like Roe. (While states could adopt a more permissive approach under Roe, it stressed that the state had a powerful interest later in a pregnancy to protect the life of the baby.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Late-term abortionsare rare, but they do occur — for a variety of medical and personal reasons. Kessler admits that \"in 2021, state records show, about 1.8 percent of 11,580 abortions in Colorado took place after 21 weeks, but just 60 took place at 25 weeks or later.\" That is 268 late-term abortions in Colorado in one year, a small percentage but not inconsequential. More importantly, the question is whether a woman has an absolute right to demand such an abortion and, if not, why? Even if statistically rare, the answer is legally significant in understanding the meaning of this right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact is that Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to a claimed right to late-term abortions. Indeed, a majority support limits on abortion after 15 weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polls show most Americans reject extreme or absolute positions on either side of the abortion issue. Polls also show that 65 percent of Americans would make most abortions illegal in the second trimester, and 80 percent would make most abortions illegal in the third.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United States is one of only 12 among the world’s 198 countries that allow abortions for any reason after 20 weeks; 47 out of 50 European countries ban abortions at 15 weeks or before. Such bans are found in countries like France, Germany, Belgium, Denmark and Spain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than address the legal and policy questions of when a right to abortion is limited or extinguished, many politicians repeat the mantra that the decision rests entirely with the woman. There is a preference to discuss anything other than restrictions of the right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was evident in a recent interview with Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running for Georgia’s governorship. Abrams was discussing abortion as an issue in the upcoming election and declared that \"there is no such thing as a heartbeat at six weeks. It is a manufactured sound designed to convince people that men have the right to take control of a woman's body.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abrams voiced a position put forward by Planned Parenthood, which changed its prior position of a “very basic beating heart” at 5 to 6 weeks of pregnancy. Now, it maintains that a \"part of the embryo starts to show cardiac activity. It sounds like a heartbeat on an ultrasound, but it’s not a fully-formed heart.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point is that people do not have to think of this as a heartbeat but rather as \"cardiac activity [that] sounds like a heartbeat.\" AlthoughAbrams put it in the more sensational terms of a male conspiracy against women, it is a distinction drawn by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), which says that, since the chambers of the heart are not fully formed, it is “clinically inaccurate” to call it a heartbeat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognizing a heartbeat no more concedes abortion as a right than it supports the right. The question is, first, whether such a right exists under state or federal law (as most Americans believe it does) and then whether that right is absolute or diminishes with the term of a pregnancy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is why late-term abortions are relevant in this debate if we are to understand a candidate's view of this right. When pressed, there has been backtracking or evasion on both sides of the abortion issues, including by some Republicans who are taking back earlier, more extreme positions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of Abrams, she previously rejected limits and said it should be left up to a mother and her doctor, which means legally leaving it up to the mother. Recently, Abrams declared she would support a right \"until a physician determines the fetus is viable outside of the body, except in the case of protecting the woman’s life or health.” The question is the scope or meaning of the health exception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There should be clarity on precisely how far this right extends, even in the relatively rare cases of late abortions. Those extremes not only define the scope but the right itself. They may also determine the support of the public, which is far more moderate than their leaders on this issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the \"blessing\" of Dobbs proves to be in this election, the absolute, unlimited right to abortion finds little support in either Roe or the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University. Follow him on Twitter @JonathanTurley.</p>",

For context, Amazon is selling it for about $300 more at the time of publishing. </p>\n<p>The B2 is LG’s midrange model; it has more features than the A-series OLED, but not as many as the C2 Evo model. Even so, movie, TV show, and gaming enthusiasts should find nearly everything they’re after with the B2, including a virtually infinite contrast ratio, the deepest of black color presentation, and a 120Hz refresh rate panel.

The arrests came after a vehicle with a Dutch number plate and containing a Kalashnikov, other firearms and two bottles of gasoline was found near the minister’s house in the Flemish town of Kortrijk, VRT and other Belgian media reported. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Belgium’s federal prosecutor’s office was informed last week of the threats, which were considered serious upon a preliminary investigation. According to Belgian media, the threats could have involved kidnapping by drug criminals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Quickenborne has been placed under strict security and will not participate in planned activities in the coming days, the minister said on Facebook Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Belgium has ramped up its fight against organized crime including drug traffickers in recent weeks after an unprecedented flare-up of drug-related violence this summer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We won’t be intimidated by anyone,” said De Croo on Saturday on Twitter. “Work continues.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Belgium and the Netherlands have become the main hubs in Europe for cocaine trafficking, according to the EU’s law enforcement agency Europol. The booming drug trade has led to an increase in assassinations, kidnappings and shootings, according to the agency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Belgian city of Antwerp, one of the world’s largest ports, has struggled to quell drug trafficking violence between gangs for several years. Ninety tons of cocaine were seized in the city in 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The people behind this are achieving the opposite of what they are aiming for,” Van Quickenborne said. “We will continue to fight organized crime, with more manpower and resources than before.”</p>",

        "description": "Dark horse for Cy Young voters? Don’t @ me I know it’s Verlander’s to lose. | Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>A third attempt at 100 wins.</p> I advise the Houston Astros fanbase to not do anything rash.\n<p>For the second time in the first two games of their four-game set against the Baltimore Orioles, the Astros were shut out on Friday night. Despite that, my advice to Astros fans is to just keep calm. The Orioles are desperate and now only three games behind the Seattle Mariners for the final wildcard spot. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, both the New York Yankees and the Cleveland Guardians are getting hot right now, each with five-game winning streaks. Houston’s lead for home-field advantage through the American League half of the postseason has shrunk to six with 10 games left on the schedule for both teams.</p>\n<p>It’s statistically negligible that Houston will fail to earn 100 wins this year. Even coin flip odds place that probability at 1-in-2048. When that happens, it’ll be the fifth time that Houston gets to that mark, and the fourth time in the past five full seasons (discounting the Dodgers asterisk-laden 2020 World Series “Championship”).</p>\nAstros News\n<p>Alex Bregman’s seven-week-old son loves baseball. </p>\n<p>Who’s favored to land Justin Verlander next season? (subscription required)</p>\n<p>Is applauding together really that hard? Pam Soper had an idea.</p>\n<p>50 Cent is slowly taking over Houston.</p>\n<p>Could Houston be a contender for another five years?</p>\nAround the MLB\n<p>So was there really any question that Albert Pujols would reach 700? </p>\n<p>The Texas Rangers could be Jacob deGrom’s favored landing spot. </p>\n<p>Which players are maybe going to retire after the season?</p>\n<p>How old is too old to take a glove into a ballpark?</p>\n<p>Is the MLB planning to expand to 32 teams? Raleigh has the inside track. </p>\nRandom Astros Player\n<p>I select a “random” Astros player by randomizing a year from 1962 through 2022, a game number (115-of-153 for the year 1972), and a plate appearance within that game (PA number 36-of-75). I came up with Roger Metzger.</p>\n<p>Roger Metzger was a six-foot, 165 lb. shortstop from Fredericksburg, TX. Born on October 10, 1947, Metzger was a first-round pick of the Chicago Cubs (16th overall) in 1969 out of St. Edward’s University. Working his way up through the minors quickly, he made his major league debut with the Cubbies on June 16, 1970, going 0-for-2. He didn’t appear with the Cubs again at the top level. Just after the end of the season, Chicago traded Metzger to Houston for Héctor Torres. </p>\n<p>Metzger joined the Astros at the major league level, and did not appear in another minor league game through the rest of his eventual 10-season major league career. Although not a huge hitting threat, Metzger did twice lead the major leagues in triples, with 11 in 1971 and with 14 in 1973. He was also the National League Gold Glove winner at shortstop for his efforts in 1973. </p>\n<p>Metzger’s +.300 WPA appearances with Houston</p>\n<p>On September 7, 1972, Metzger went four-for-five, including a 13th-inning three-run home run for Houston in an eventual 5-1 win over the San Francisco Giants. On June 3, 1975, trailing 4-3, he led off the eighth inning against the New York Mets with a triple on a two-for-three night. The Astros lost that one by the same margin after stranding Metzger on third. </p>\n<p>Here’s the only footage I could find of Metzger, in a 1977 Astros vs. Reds broadcast:</p>\n\n<p>Defensively, Metzger played a total of 8734 1/3 innings at shortstop for Houston, of 10,001 overall. Although he only took home the one Gold Glove, he was in yearly discussions for the honor. On June 15, 1978, in the middle of the season, Metzger was sold to the Giants. </p>\n<p>Metzger played in 1,021 games for Houston in total, slashing .229/.291/.291 with five homers and 206 RBI. He drew 317 walks vs. 399 whiffs in 4,100 career plate appearances, and stole 64 bases in 96 attempts. His WAR while with the Astros has him slightly above replacement level, with a career-total of 4.2. He totaled 3.4 overall, but that includes some substandard seasons with the Giants at the end of his career. </p>\n<p>Just a reminder, next first-pitch will be at 6:05PM CST, tonight in Baltimore against the Orioles. As always, thanks for reading. </p>",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/braves-place-spencer-strider-on-il-with-oblique-strain.html",
        "description": "<p>The Atlanta Braves announced they have placed starting pitcher Spencer Strider on the 15-day IL with a strained left oblique muscle, backdated to September 21st. RHP Alan Rangel will be recalled in a corresponding move. The Braves have also reinstated Ehire Adrianza from the 10-day IL and have optioned infielder Rylan Bannon to Triple-A Gwinnett.</p>\n<p>Strider has been nothing short of sensational for Atlanta in 2022. Slotted as a bullpen arm to start the season, Strider dominated in relief, posting a 2.22 ERA in 24 1/3 innings out of the ’pen. The Braves transitioned the rookie to the rotation in May 30, where he has been one of the most effective starters in baseball. In 107 1/3 innings over 20 starts, Strider has held opponents to a .183 BA and a minuscule .274 slugging. He was named NL Rookie of the Month in July and has amassed 202 strikeouts between his work in the bullpen and the rotation, good for fourth in the senior circuit.</p>\n<p>Strider’s move to the IL follows a brilliant outing on September 18th against the Phillies, in which he struck out 10 batters and gave up one run over six innings. He left the game with a tender left oblique, which prompted the Braves to preemptively push back his next start as a precaution. Strider will remain on the IL until the final day of the regular season, calling his readiness for the postseason into question should he suffer any setbacks. For the time being, it seems likely that right-hander Bryce Elder will continue to fill Strider’s spot in the rotation, as he did when Strider was initially pushed back. Alan Rangel will be recalled to account for the Braves’ hole in their pitching matrix. Rangel has started 26 games in 2022 for Double-A Mississippi and has accumulated a 5.26 ERA.</p>\n<p>It will be a massive loss for Atlanta if Strider is unable to pitch in the postseason. This will hold especially true if the Braves are unable to win the NL East and are forced to compete in one of the NL Wild Card Series, where a 1-2 punch of Strider and Max Fried would be particularly formidable. Should Strider not be available for the Wild Card Series, the Braves rotation figures to be Fried in Game 1, Kyle Wright in Game 2, and Charlie Morton in the decider. There is also the scenario in which Strider, without the luxury of a traditional minor league rehab process, comes out of the bullpen for Atlanta for one or more postseason series. Regardless of what transpires, Brian Snitker and his staff will have their hands full as they balance the Braves’ immediate postseason aspirations with the future health of their budding ace.</p>\n<p>Adrianza will return to Atlanta’s bench after being placed on the 10-day IL with a left quad strain. The 33-year old utility infielder began 2022 with the Nationals before being returning to the Braves via a trade deadline swap. Adrianza has only logged eight at-bats for the Braves since his arrival in August, collecting a singular hit. Adrianza takes the place of infielder Rylan Bannon, who the Braves claimed off waivers in August. Bannon only played in one game during his time with the Braves and made no plate-appearances.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Research in the field of machine learning and AI, now a key technology in practically every industry and company, is far too voluminous for anyone to read it all. This column, Perceptron, aims to collect some of the most relevant recent discoveries and papers — particularly in, but not limited to, artificial intelligence — and explain why they matter.</p>\n<p>Over the past few weeks, researchers at Google have demoed an AI system, PaLI, that can perform many tasks in over 100 languages. Elsewhere, a Berlin-based group launched a project called Source+ that’s designed as a way of allowing artists, including visual artists, musicians and writers, to opt into — and out of — allowing their work being used as training data for AI.</p>\n<p>AI systems like OpenAI’s GPT-3 can generate fairly sensical text, or summarize existing text from the web, ebooks and other sources of information. But they’re historically been limited to a single language, limiting both their usefulness and reach.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, in recent months, research into multilingual systems has accelerated — driven partly by community efforts like Hugging Face’s Bloom. In an attempt to leverage these advances in multilinguality, a Google team created PaLI, which was trained on both images and text to perform tasks like image captioning, object detection and optical character recognition.</p>\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: Google</p><p></p>\n<p>Google claims that PaLI can understand 109 languages and the relationships between words in those languages and images, enabling it to — for example — caption a picture of a postcard in French. While the work remains firmly in the research phases, the creators say that it illustrates the important interplay between language and images — and could establish a foundation for a commercial product down the line.</p>\n<p>Speech is another aspect of language that AI is constantly improving in. Play.ht recently showed off a new text-to-speech model that puts a remarkable amount of emotion and range into its results. The clips it posted last week sound fantastic, though they are of course cherry-picked.</p>\n<p>We generated a clip of our own using the intro to this article, and the results are still solid:</p>\n<p>\nhttps://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/perceptron-peregrine.wav</p>\n<p>Exactly what this type of voice generation will be most useful for is still unclear. We’re not quite at the stage where they do whole books — or rather, they can, but it may not be anyone’s first choice yet. But as the quality rises, the applications multiply.</p>\n<p>Mat Dryhurst and Holly Herndon — an academic and musician, respectively — have partnered with the organization Spawning to launch Source+, a standard they hope will bring attention to the issue of photo-generating AI systems created using artwork from artists who weren’t informed or asked permission. Source+, which doesn’t cost anything, aims to allow artists to disallow their work to be used for AI training purposes if they choose.</p>\n<p>Image-generating systems like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2 were trained on billions of images scraped from the web to “learn” how to translate text prompts into art. Some of these images came from public art communities like ArtStation and DeviantArt — not necessarily with artists’ knowledge — and imbued the systems with the ability to mimic particular creators, including artists like Greg Rutowski.</p>\n<p></p><p>Samples from Stable Diffusion.</p><p></p>\n<p>Because of the systems’ knack for imitating art styles, some creators fear that they could threaten livelihoods. Source+ — while voluntary — could be a step toward giving artists greater say in how their art’s used, Dryhurst and Herndon say — assuming it’s adopted at scale (a big if).</p>\n<p>Over at DeepMind, a research team is attempting to solve another longstanding problematic aspect of AI: its tendency to spew toxic and misleading information. Focusing on text, the team developed a chatbot called Sparrow that can answer common questions by searching the web using Google. Other cutting-edge systems like Google’s LaMDA can do the same, but DeepMind claims that Sparrow provides plausible, non-toxic answers to questions more often than its counterparts.</p>\n<p>The trick was aligning the system with people’s expectations of it. DeepMind recruited people to use Sparrow and then had them provide feedback to train a model of how useful the answers were, showing participants multiple answers to the same question and asking them which answer they liked the most. The researchers also defined rules for Sparrow such as “don’t make threatening statements” and “don’t make hateful or insulting comments,” which they had participants impose on the system by trying to trick it into breaking the rules.</p>\n<p></p><p>Example of DeepMind’s sparrow having a conversation.</p><p></p>\n<p>DeepMind acknowledges that Sparrow has room for improvement. But in a study, the team found the chatbot provided a “plausible” answer supported with evidence 78% of the time when asked a factual question and only broke the aforementioned rules 8% of the time. That’s better than DeepMind’s original dialogue system, the researchers note, which broke the rules roughly three times more often when tricked into doing so.</p>\n<p>A separate team at DeepMind tackled a very different domain recently: video games that historically have been tough for AI to master quickly. Their system, cheekily called MEME, reportedly achieved “human-level” performance on 57 different Atari games 200 times faster than the previous best system.</p>\n<p>According to DeepMind’s paper detailing MEME, the system can learn to play games by observing roughly 390 million frames — “frames” referring to the still images that refresh very quickly to give the impression of motion. That might sound like a lot, but the previous state-of-the-art technique required 80 billion frames across the same number of Atari games.</p>\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: DeepMind</p><p></p>\n<p>Deftly playing Atari might not sound like a desirable skill. And indeed, some critics argue games are a flawed AI benchmark because of their abstractness and relative simplicity. But research labs like DeepMind believe the approaches could be applied to other, more useful areas in the future, like robots that more efficiently learn to perform tasks by watching videos or self-improving, self-driving cars.</p>\n<p>Nvidia had a field day on the 20th announcing dozens of products and services, among them several interesting AI efforts. Self-driving cars are one of the company’s foci, both powering the AI and training it. For the latter, simulators are crucial and it is likewise important that the virtual roads resemble real ones. They describe a new, improved content flow that accelerates bringing data collected by cameras and sensors on real cars into the digital realm.</p>\n<p></p><p>A simulation environment built on real-world data.</p><p></p>\n<p>Things like real-world vehicles and irregularities in the road or tree cover can be accurately reproduced, so the self-driving AI doesn’t learn in a sanitized version of the street. And it makes it possible to create larger and more variable simulation settings in general, which aids robustness. (Another image of it is up top.)</p>\n<p>Nvidia also introduced its IGX system for autonomous platforms in industrial situations — human-machine collaboration like you might find on a factory floor. There’s no shortage of these, of course, but as the complexity of tasks and operating environments increases, the old methods don’t cut it any more and companies looking to improve their automation are looking at future-proofing.</p>\n<p></p><p>Example of computer vision classifying objects and people on a factory floor.</p><p></p>\n<p>“Proactive” and “predictive” safety are what IGX is intended to help with, which is to say catching safety issues before they cause outages or injuries. A bot may have its own emergency stop mechanism, but if a camera monitoring the area could tell it to divert before a forklift gets in its way, everything goes a little more smoothly. Exactly what company or software accomplishes this (and on what hardware, and how it all gets paid for) is still a work in progress, with the likes of Nvidia and startups like Veo Robotics feeling their way through.</p>\n\n<p>Harmonizing human-robot interactions for a ‘new and weird’ world of work</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another interesting step forward was taken in Nvidia’s home turf of gaming. The company’s latest and greatest GPUs are built not just to push triangles and shaders, but to quickly accomplish AI-powered tasks like its own DLSS tech for uprezzing and adding frames.</p>\n<p>The issue they’re trying to solve is that gaming engines are so demanding that generating more than 120 frames per second (to keep up with the latest monitors) while maintaining visual fidelity is a Herculean task even powerful GPUs can barely do. But DLSS is sort of like an intelligent frame blender that can increase the resolution of the source frame without aliasing or artifacts, so the game doesn’t have to push quite so many pixels.</p>\n<p>In DLSS 3, Nvidia claims it can generate entire additional frames at a 1:1 ratio, so you could be rendering 60 frames naturally and the other 60 via AI. I can think of several reasons that might make things weird in a high performance gaming environment, but Nvidia is probably well aware of those. At any rate you’ll need to pay about a grand for the privilege of using the new system, since it will only run on RTX 40 series cards. But if graphical fidelity is your top priority, have at it.</p>\n<p></p><p>Illustration of drones building in a remote area.</p><p></p>\n<p>Last thing today is a drone-based 3D printing technique from Imperial College London that could be used for autonomous building processes sometime in the deep future. For now it’s definitely not practical for creating anything bigger than a trash can, but it’s still early days. Eventually they hope to make it more like the above, and it does look cool, but watch the video below to get your expectations straight.</p>\n\n<p>Perceptron: Multilingual, laughing, Pitfall-playing and streetwise AI by Kyle Wiggers originally published on TechCrunch</p>",

        "description": "<p>Two people were injured in a shooting Friday night outside a high school homecoming football game in Richfield.</p><p>The sound of gunfire sent players and fans running to evacuate the stadium at Richfield High School. The two people wounded — an 18-year-old male and 21-year-old male — suffered what authorities said were non-life-threatening injuries.</p><p>The Richfield school district has canceled all weekend activities \"to help ensure student safety and to allow us all a little room to breathe, reflect and heal.\"</p><p>“I am heartbroken by the violence that broke out at the homecoming game, which has deeply impacted our entire community,” Richfield High School Principal Stacy Theien-Collins said in a statement posted on the district's website. “What was supposed to be a weekend of celebration and school pride is now a time when we must come together in support and solidarity.”</p><p>The district said counselors and social workers will be on-site at the school to talk with students.</p><p>Richfield police said the shooting happened at about 8:45 p.m. Friday in the fourth quarter of the high school’s homecoming football game against Bloomington Kennedy. </p><p>“A school staff member advised an on-site police officer that school officials had turned away a number of individuals from game entry that appeared to be waiting for the game to end. The individuals were gathered a short distance northeast of the football field,” a police news release stated.</p><p>The officer drove to that area, heard two gunshots and saw people running from the scene. KARE 11 reported a livestream of the game showed players running off the field after the shots were fired. </p><p>Authorities evacuated the stadium.</p><p>At last report, police said investigators had not yet identified a suspect or made any arrests in the case.</p>",

        "description": "In Part 2 of our interview with the mother and sister of Phillip Pannell, the 16-year-old Black boy fatally shot in the back in 1990 by a white police officer, we discuss how the officer was acquitted and whether the case could be reopened in the wake of officer convictions for the murder of George Floyd and the growing movement for police accountability. Pannell is the subject of “Model America,” a new four-part series airing on MSNBC. We speak with Pannell’s sister, Natacha Pannell; his mother, Thelma Pannell-Dantzler; and the series’s co-director, Dani Goffstein, who was raised in Teaneck, where Pannell was killed.",

        "description": "<p>A new series examines how protests that erupted over a police killing three decades ago offer important lessons for the Black Lives Matter movement today. We speak to the family of Phillip Pannell, a 16-year-old Black boy who was fatally shot in the back in 1990 by a white police officer later acquitted for the killing. Pannell is the subject of “Model America,” a new four-part series by MSNBC that looks at the racial divide in the U.S. through the lens of the small town of Teaneck, New Jersey, where the shooting took place. “Here we are 32 years later, and it’s still happening,” says his sister, Natacha Pannell. His mother Thelma Pannell-Dantzler says the police officer, Gary Spath, lied on the stand about the shooting and “should be prosecuted” for perjury. We also speak with the series’s co-director, Dani Goffstein, who was raised in Teaneck and says he became interested in the story after noticing parallels with the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014.</p>",

Over 1,300 protesters have been arrested at antiwar demonstrations, with one prominent rights group saying some protesters are being forced to enlist or face heavy jail time. We go to Moscow for an update with Anna Dobrovolskaya, the former executive director of the Memorial Human Rights Center in Moscow, which was shut down by the government last year. She says some people who are drafted without any military experience are publishing their stories, and thousands more have fled Russia to avoid being forced to enlist. “People will be trying to save their lives with any tools they can,” says Dobrovolskaya.</p>",

He also discusses Cuba’s abstentions in U.N. votes critical of Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, saying that while Cuba “cannot and does not support” a violation of another country’s sovereignty, the U.S. still bears “huge responsibility” for the conflict because of its push to expand NATO into Eastern Europe.</p>",

If the lawsuit is successful, the Trump Organization could be barred from conducting business in the state of New York. “He’s gotten away with this for decades. Now he’s going to have to answer in civil court,” says award-winning reporter David Cay Johnston, who has covered Trump for years.

He has not been declared legally innocent, and prosecutors could decide to retry the case, but that appears unlikely. We speak with Syed’s first attorney, Doug Colbert, who says Brady violations, in which prosecutors fail to disclose evidence to the defense, happen “much too often.” He argues, “There are many other people innocent of their crimes who should not have been convicted.”</p>",

Mwalim Peters, English and Black studies professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, recounts the little-known story of the Reverse Freedom Rides and says the strategy to humiliate liberals is “basically identical to what’s happening now in Martha’s Vineyard” and other sanctuary cities, where Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Texas Governor Greg Abbott are sending asylum seekers under false pretenses of free housing and jobs.

        "description": "<p>President Biden declared that “the pandemic is over” during an interview on “60 Minutes” Sunday, despite data collected by Johns Hopkins showing COVID-19 killed 13,000 people across the U.S. over the past month as 2.2 million new infections were reported. “I think it’s very premature to say that we see the end is in sight with this pandemic,” says Steven Thrasher, author of “The Viral Underclass: The Human Toll When Inequality and Disease Collide.” He adds that the sentiment from the nation’s leader is dangerous because it discourages people from wearing masks and seeking booster vaccinations, which are still vital to prevent the virus’s spread.</p>",

It just needs to go. And this is the perfect time to discuss when it should end,” says Andrews.</p>",

He says rising global temperatures have worsened the effects of storms like these, and more aggressive climate legislation from Congress is needed. “We are experiencing devastating consequences of past climate inaction, and it really drives home the importance of taking action now,” says Mann.</p>",

Maté also discusses how the healthcare system has harmfully promoted the “mechanization of birth,” how the lack of social services for parents has led to “a massive abandonment of infants,” and how capitalism has fueled addiction and the rise of youth suicide rates.</p>",

Locomotive engineer Ron Kaminkow, the organizer for Railroad Workers United, says the railway crisis is “30 years in the making,” and describes how resentment has grown among workers as rail company executives slash resources for their employees while raking in record profits.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The geopolitical rivalry between the United States and China is reshaping life in the U.S. territory of Guam, where the already-massive military presence is set to expand as the Pentagon builds up its capabilities in the Pacific. “We are directly in the line of fire,” says Julian Aguon, a CHamoru writer and human rights lawyer, who describes the build-up of U.S. troops and military infrastructure on Guam as “nothing less than cataclysmic” for the Indigenous people. Aguon also talks about the ongoing fight for independence in Guam, which he says the U.S. has thwarted for more than a century. “The U.S. is a country that prefers, routinely, power over strength and living over letting live.” Aguon is the author of several acclaimed books, including, “The Fire This Time: Stories of Life Under U.S. Occupation” and “What We Bury at Night: Disposable Humanity.” His most recent book, released Tuesday, is titled “No Country for Eight-Spot Butterflies.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>We look at how the Ukraine war is contributing to an energy crisis across Europe with Greek politician and economist Yanis Varoufakis. Last week Russia announced it would not resume sending natural gas to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, blaming Western sanctions for supposed maintenance delays keeping the gas shut off. Prior to the war, Russia supplied Europe with 40% of its natural gas, but now European nations must find ways to cope with fuel shortages and soaring energy prices as winter approaches. Varoufakis says a history of market liberalization and reliance on cheap Russian gas has left the continent scrambling, in turn pushing up energy costs in the Global South as richer European countries buy up other sources of energy. “Yet again, Europe is exporting misery to the rest of the world,” says Varoufakis, a member of the Greek Parliament and former finance minister. His latest piece for Project Syndicate is “Time to Blow Up Electricity Markets.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>We look at how the death of Queen Elizabeth II is prompting former British colonies in the Caribbean to replace the British monarch as their head of state. Antigua and Barbuda’s prime minister has vowed to hold a referendum soon on whether to become a republic, and Jamaica’s ruling Labour Party also plans a vote. The Caribbean at one point formed the heart of England’s first colonial empire in North America, with millions of enslaved Africans taken to the islands, where many were worked to death. Dorbrene O’Marde, chair of the Antigua and Barbuda Reparations Commission, says he is not personally mourning Queen Elizabeth’s death because her reign helped to “cloak the historical brutality of empire in this veneer of grandeur and pomp and pageantry.” We also speak with renowned Jamaican poet and musician Mutabaruka, who says the British monarchy “represents criminal activity” and that the British state needs to make reparations to former colonies like Jamaica to redress the history of abuses. “Actions speak louder than words,” he says.</p>",

        "link": "http://www.democracynow.org/2022/9/12/jackson_mississippi_water_crisis_flood_treatment",
        "description": "<p>We look at how corporate involvement in Jackson, Mississippi’s infrastructure helped set the stage for its water crisis, as tens of thousands of residents of the majority-Black city remain under a boil water advisory. The main water treatment plant was damaged after a flood in late August, and while water pressure has been restored to most homes, viral videos show undrinkable brown liquid coming out of many taps. Mississippi’s Governor Tate Reeves has said “privatization is on the table” for the state capital. This could lead to a repeat of problems stemming from a $90 million contract Jackson signed in 2010 with the German multinational conglomerate Siemens to overhaul the city’s water infrastructure and install new water meters meant to raise extra revenue and help the city reinvest in the system. “This contract ended up being a disaster,” says Judd Legum, who wrote about the Siemens deal for his independent political newsletter Popular Information. “There was essentially a lost decade where the system deteriorated further and there were really no substantial investments made, and that’s part of the reason why we see what’s going on today.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>Just after midnight on New Year’s Day of 2021, Newark police officer Rod Simpkins shot 39-year-old Carl Dorsey dead. Simpkins was in an unmarked police minivan and in plainclothes when he arrived at the scene after reportedly hearing gunshots. Within seconds of exiting his car, Simpkins fired his gun at Dorsey. It is unclear if he announced himself as a police officer. The family of the unarmed Black man killed that night is now suing the police and the city of Newark, frustrated that the investigation by the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office has dragged on for 20 months with no findings so far. “We’re demanding justice for my brother, and we need people to be accountable for what happened to him,” says Madinah Person, Dorsey’s sister. Larry Hamm, chair of the People’s Organization for Progress, says New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin owes the family and the wider community answers. “Two years is too long not to hear anything from the attorney general about this case,” says Hamm.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The death of Queen Elizabeth II has focused global attention on the British royal family and renewed criticism of the monarchy both inside the U.K. and abroad, especially among peoples colonized by Britain. “There’s a degree of psychosis that you can go to another people’s land, colonize them, and then expect them to honor you at the same time,” says Kenyan American author Mukoma Wa Ngugi, who teaches literature at Cornell University and whose own family was deeply impacted by the bloody British suppression of the Mau Mau revolution. He says that with Queen Elizabeth’s death, there needs to be a “dismantling” of the Commonwealth and a real reckoning with colonial abuses. We also speak with Harvard historian Caroline Elkins, a leading scholar of British colonialism, who says that while it’s unclear how much Queen Elizabeth personally knew about concentration camps, torture and other abuses in Kenya during her early reign, the monarchy must reckon with that legacy. “Serious crimes happened on the queen’s imperial watch. In fact, her picture hung in every detention camp in Kenya as detainees were beaten in order to exact their loyalty to the British crown,” says Elkins.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by David J. Griffin/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Spencer Strider won’t be able to face the Mets in Atlanta as a result of this move</p> <p>A few days ago, when the Braves reshuffled their rotation, it looked like they were giving Spencer Strider a breather and lining him up to face the Mets in Atlanta.</p>\n<p>Now, all of that appears to have been thrown into disarray, as Strider is hitting the Injured List and appears likely to miss the rest of the regular season:</p>\n\n\n<p>The #Braves today reinstated INF Ehire Adrianza from the 10-day injured list, recalled RHP Alan Rangel to Atlanta, placed RHP Spencer Strider on the 15-day injured list, backdated to Sept. 21, with a strained left oblique muscle, &amp; optioned INF Rylan Bannon to Triple-A Gwinnett.</p>— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>At the time that Bryce Elder was announced to be the starter for last Wednesday’s game against Washington, Strider’s oblique ailment was downplayed. For whatever reason, as we await further reporting or comment on this roster move, it has now been termed serious enough to warrant an IL stint. Given that you can only backdate such stints three days, Strider will be ineligible to appear for the remainder of the regular season. The Braves will have to figure something else out for one of the remaining three games against the Mets.</p>\n<p>Bundled with this unfortunate news is that Alan Rangel is being promoted to the majors for the first time. Rangel was added to the 40-man roster last offseason and spent the year repeating Double-A, where he had an uninspiring 4.30 FIP and 4.52 xFIP, showing issues with both walks and homers.</p>\n<p>The Braves also activated Ehire Adrianza from the Injured List and optioned Rylan Bannon. The latter made his first appearance in a Braves uniform as a defensive replacement during last night’s shellacking in Philadelphia, but didn’t get a PA. Adrianza returns to a line featuring a 39 wRC+ and -0.5 fWAR in 105 PAs; he’s gotten 11 PAs in five games with the Braves since being acquired ahead of the Trade Deadline. </p>\n<p>The Braves’ division odds dipped below 15 percent with last night’s loss and the Mets’ win. They’ve likely tumbled a bit more now, as Strider will have to be replaced in the rotation. The Braves can still win the NL East —all they have to do is what they’ve done most of the season: win games.</p>",

He posted a maximum exit velocity of 103.3 miles per hour with the Hammerheads. Shortstop is still his primary defensive position.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of room on his frame to add weight. Cappé will try to find that delicate balance between getting stronger while maintaining as much speed and flexibility as possible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pitcher of the Year: Eury Pérez </p>\n\n<p></p>\n\nSigned with Marlins as international free agent on July 2, 2019\n2022 stats (AA/A): 3.97 ERA, 1.14 WHIP, .221 BAA, 25 BB, 110 K in 77.0 IP\nTurned 19 years old on April 15\n\n<p>The door cracked open in August for another MiLB arm to steal this award from Pérez when he went on the injured list. Even before his fantastic playoff performance, I though lefty Dax Fulton had a solid case based on the disparity in their workload (3.80 ERA, 1.31 WHIP, .252 BAA, 42 BB, 150 K in 118.1 IP). I suppose it helped Pérez’s candidacy that he excelled in his Futures Game appearance.</p>\n<p>Pérez distinguished himself as the best overall prospect in the Marlins org and the second-most important pitcher for the franchise moving forward (behind only Sandy Alcantara).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Triple-A Jacksonville MVP: Charles Leblanc </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nSelected by Marlins in minor league phase of 2021 Rule 5 Draft\n2022 Jacksonville stats: .302/.381/.503, 134 wRC+, 14 HR, 6 SB in 318 PA (87 G)\nTurned 26 years old on June 3\n\n<p>Leblanc was completely off the prospect grid entering 2022. There comes a point, though, when results should supersede scouting reports. He made a huge year-to-year improvement to his strikeout rate while continuing to generate loud contact and contribute with his glove all over the field. And unlike most of his Jumbo Shrimp teammates, Leblanc has had immediate success in the majors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Double-A Pensacola MVP: Troy Johnston </p>\n\n\n<p>TROY JOHNSTON IS UNSTOPPABLE!<br /><br />ANOTHER WALK-OFF WINNER! pic.twitter.com/0pHX9nnmDM</p>— Pensacola Blue Wahoos (@BlueWahoosBBall) June 16, 2022\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nSelected by Marlins in 17th round of 2019 MLB Draft\n2022 Pensacola stats: .292/.360/.450, 113 wRC+, 10 HR, 3 SB in 376 PA (85 G)\nTurned 25 years old on June 22\n\n<p>During the club’s late May/early June homestand, Johnston was as dominant as any Marlins minor league hitter in recent memory in terms of both overall production and high-leverage success. Just when it seemed like the ship had sailed on him playing multiple positions, the regular first baseman picked up occasional reps in left field leading up to his promotion to Triple-A.</p>\n<p>Drafted out of Gonzaga back in 2019, Johnston will be Rule 5 Draft-eligible this offseason unless the Marlins squeeze him onto their 40-man roster. I suspect they will protect him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>High-A Beloit MVP: Nasim Nunez </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nSelected by Marlins in second round of 2019 MLB Draft\n2022 Beloit stats: .247/.390/.323, 112 wRC+, 2 HR, 49 SB in 378 PA (85 G)\nTurned 22 years old on August 18\n\n<p>A big question for me entering this season was whether Nunez’s elite walk rate in the low minors would be sustainable as he moved up the minor league ranks and faced pitchers with better control. The answer is yes! The switch-hitter is disciplined from both sides of the plate, which is so valuable considering his impact on the basepaths. Nunez topped all of Minor League Baseball’s High-A players with 7.3 Base Running Runs, according to Baseball Prospectus.</p>\n<p>So what if he has limited over-the-fence power? I loved watching Nunez this season—especially defensively—and view him as one of this organization’s very best position player prospects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Low-A Jupiter MVP: José Salas </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nSigned with Marlins as international free agent on July 2, 2019\n2022 Jupiter stats: .267/.355/.421, 123 wRC+, 5 HR, 15 SB in 257 PA (61 G)\nTurned 19 years old on April 26\n\n<p>There is a theme here. Like Johnston and Nunez, Salas struggled during the opening weeks of the regular season, then found his groove. He has similarities to Cappé too as the biggest name/most expensive member of his respective international signing class. Salas scorched a ball with a 108 mph exit velo and unsurprisingly moved up to High-A soon after that.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>FCL Marlins MVP: Javier Sanoja </p>\n\nSigned with Marlins as international free agent on July 2, 2019\n2022 FCL stats: .318/.382/.514, 143 wRC+, 3 HR, 9 SB in 124 PA (28 G)\nTurned 20 years old on September 3\n\n<p>Sanoja is the rare modern player with a sub-10% strikeout rate. Listed at 5-foot-9, he might be even tinier than that.</p>\n<p>The Marlins are experimenting with him as a center fielder in addition to the infield positions. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>DSL Marlins MVP: José Gerardo </p>\n\nSigned with Marlins as international free agent on January 15, 2022\n2022 DSL stats: .284/.417/.551, 156 wRC+, 11 HR, 18 SB in 218 PA (50 G)\nTurned 17 years old on June 12\n\n<p>In addition to stuffing the box score, Gerardo reportedly has 80-grade arm strength.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>DSL Miami MVP: Marco Vargas </p>\n\nSigned with Marlins as international free agent on January 15, 2022\n2022 DSL stats: .319/.421/.456, 139 wRC+, 2 HR, 14 SB in 221 PA (53 G)\nTurned 17 years old on May 14\n\n<p>Vargas is the only qualified player in the Marlins org who had more walks (35) than strikeouts (32) this season.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Service Members of the Year: Jordan McCants and Noah Williamson </p>\n\nMcCants—selected by Marlins in third round of 2021 MLB Draft; played this season with FCL Marlins; turned 20 years old on May 21\nWilliamson—selected by Marlins in 19th round of 2021 MLB Draft; played this season with FCL Marlins; turned 22 years old on August 23\n\n\n\n<p>.@JessBlaylock is joined by a couple of Marlins prospects during the 6th -- Jupiter MVP Jose Salas and Service Member of the Year Noah Williamson!<br /><br />               → https://t.co/K7Q2PKkRkX@Marlins | #MakeItMiami pic.twitter.com/Cb5J2QPRAM</p>— Bally Sports Florida: Marlins (@BallyMarlins) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Student of the Year: Ronald Hernández </p>\n\nSigned with Marlins as international free agent on January 15, 2021\nPlayed this season with FCL Marlins\nTurns 19 years old on October 23\n\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>This story first appeared at ProPublica. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The property management subsidiary of Jared Kushner’s family real estate company has agreed to pay a $3.25 million fine to the state of Maryland and to reimburse many of the tens of thousands of tenants in the Kushners’ Baltimore-area apartment complexes for excessive fees and for rent they were forced to pay over the past decade despite serious maintenance problems in the units.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The agreement represents the settlement of a 2019 lawsuit brought against the subsidiary, Westminster Management, by the Maryland attorney general. The state alleged that the company’s “unfair or deceptive” rental practices violated Maryland’s consumer protection laws and “victimized” people, “many of whom are financially vulnerable, at all stages of offering and leasing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is a case in which landlords deceived and cheated tenants and subjected them to miserable living conditions,” said Attorney General Brian Frosh, a Democrat, at a press conference announcing the settlement Friday morning in Baltimore. “These were not wealthy people. Many struggled to pay the rent, to put food on the table, to take care of their kids, to keep everybody healthy, and Westminster used its vastly superior economic power to take advantage of them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kushner Companies, which has since sold off most of the complexes, did not respond to requests for comment, but in a statement to the Baltimore Banner, it said: “Westminster is pleased to have settled this litigation with no admission of liability or wrongdoing. We look forward to moving past this matter so that we can focus on our ever-expanding real estate portfolio.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frosh took issue with that characterization. “You don’t pay three million two hundred and fifty thousand bucks if you’re not liable,” he said. “They may not have formally signed a piece of paper saying that they did it, but they did.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state lawsuit followed on the heels of a May 2017 article co-published by ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine describing the Kushner Companies’ highly litigious treatment of tenants at the apartment complexes it started buying in the Baltimore suburbs in 2012. The 17 complexes contained a total of about 9,000 units and provided a strong cash-flow ballast for a real estate company better known for trophy properties in New York.</p>\n\n\n\nThe Dutch Village apartment complex is seen on July 30, 2019 in Baltimore, Maryland.

(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n<p>The article reported that the company had brought hundreds of cases against current and former tenants over unpaid rent and broken leases, including people who had moved out of the complexes before the Kushner Companies even purchased them. The company also pursued tenants who possessed evidence that they did not owe the money claimed, with all manner of court and late fees piling on top of the original claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article also described the shoddy conditions that many tenants had to contend with at the complexes, including mice, leaky roofs and rampant mold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Friday’s press conference, Frosh and two former tenants elaborated on the deplorable conditions. Frosh showed images from squalid units, including one of a large cluster of mushrooms growing beside a toilet. Tiffany Dixon described the floor and wall damage in her family’s unit at a Kushner complex called Commons of White Marsh that she said was caused by a large hole under the kitchen sink of an adjacent unit. Dixon recounted the horrifying discovery, after her kitchen stove stopped working, of mice remains inside the oven. Vaughn Phillips described living in a unit in another complex, Fontana Village, that had water pouring out of the kitchen wall for months “to the point where there was a small pond in my kitchen and living area.” Phillips also said that gas leaked from the unit’s kitchen stove and that “mice that would come out and watch TV with me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frosh displayed one of the many internal company emails that his office obtained during its investigation, showing that officials were well aware of the problems. “We desperately need your help at the Commons of White Marsh with the number of roof leaks that are still occurring due to the damage of the storm that was caused from the storm back in March,” the community manager at the complex wrote to the director of construction at Kushner Companies, in September 2018. “I am receiving at least 30 complaints per day and residents coming [in] and screaming in office. We have a large amount of drywall damage and potential for mold is becoming an issue.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the state’s lawsuit in 2019, a group of tenants filed a class-action lawsuit in late 2017, alleging that the company was improperly inflating payments owed by tenants by charging them late fees that are often unfounded and court fees that are not actually approved by any court. That case made its way to the state Court of Special Appeals in early 2021, but a ruling has not yet been issued. (The Kushner entities have denied wrongdoing in that suit.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state case against the company won a major victory in April 2021, when an administrative law judge found that Westminster violated consumer laws in several areas, including by not showing tenants the actual units they were going to be assigned to before signing a lease, and by assessing them a range of “spurious” fees. The ruling came after a 31-day hearing in which about 100 current and former tenants testified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company had initially downplayed the lawsuit as a politically motivated stunt to embarrass Kushner, the highly influential son-in-law of then-President Donald Trump. But after the ruling by the administrative law judge, the company entered into negotiations with the state. “It became very clear that they had done wrong and we were not going to let them off the hook,” Frosh said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frosh said that the state was looking into whether other large landlords in Maryland have been engaging in practices similar to those employed by Westminster. The Baltimore Banner recently reported that Maryland landlords are far more aggressive in using the courts to threaten eviction as a routine practice for collecting rent than are landlords in other states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the terms of the settlement, Westminster must make an effort to reach all of the estimated 30,000 tenants who resided in its Baltimore-area complexes to alert them that they may submit claims of restitution for rent they were forced to pay despite substandard conditions. Former tenants will be able to start submitting claims in three months and will then have a year to do so. The claims will then be assessed by a special master selected by the company with the approval of the state. Separately, the company will automatically reimburse former tenants for excessive court fees and late fees, based on its records; former tenants will not need to file claims for that restitution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Westminster may end up paying considerably more than $3.25 million, since there is no limit on the amount of restitution the special master can order. (Of the $3.25 million fine, $800,000 will be treated as a down payment on the restitution.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former tenants at the press conference expressed satisfaction with the settlement. “I wasn’t looking for financial gain,” Dixon said. “I was just looking for justice. I was looking for someone to acknowledge the negligence so that other people didn’t have to endure what we did.”</p>",

        "title": "How Roberto Clemente Harnessed Celebrity To Change America",
        "link": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/how-roberto-clemente-harnessed-celebrity-to-change-america",
        "description": "<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>This article is part of TPM Cafe, TPM’s home for opinion and news analysis. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>September 15 was not only the beginning of Hispanic Heritage Month but also Roberto Clemente Day. To honor the great Latino ballplayer, major league players wore his jersey number: 21. But the Tampa Bay Rays went further. On that day, for the first time in major league history, the Rays’ entire starting lineup was comprised of Latin American players – three from the Dominican Republic, two each from Venezuela and Cuba, and one each from Colombia and Mexico.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente was not the first Latino to play major league baseball, but he was the first Latino superstar. He saw that as both a responsibility and an opportunity. Like Jackie Robinson, he used his athletic celebrity to speak out on behalf of social and racial justice. And like Robinson, he faced racism and pushback from owners, fans, sportswriters, and even some fellow players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente had an impressive 18-year major league career (1955-72), during which he played solely for the Pittsburgh Pirates. He played in 15 All-Star games, won four batting titles, was named the National League’s Most Valuable Player in 1966, lead the Pirates to World Series championships in 1960 and 1971, reached 3,000 hits in his next-to-last game in 1972 (a feat surpassed by only 10 other major leaguers at the time), and had a lifetime batting average of .317, with 240 home runs, 1,305 RBIs, and 12 Gold Glove awards as best fielding outfielder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in 1934 in Carolina, Puerto Rico, Clemente starred as an all-around athlete in high school. His arm was so strong that he became an Olympic prospect throwing the javelin. But he loved baseball and signed with the Dodgers in 1954, at a time when there were few Black and few Latino players on major league rosters. After one year in the minors, the Dodgers sold Clemente to the Pirates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente fought constantly against negative stereotypes, prevalent at the time, of emotional and lackadaisical Latinos. He bristled over the racist way that sportswriters covered him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sportswriters and baseball card companies called him Bobby or Bob, instead of his preferred name, Roberto, while white players were always asked what they wanted to be called. Writers made fun of his accent, quoted him in broken English, and paid little attention to his powerful intellect and social conscience. He knew little English when he joined the majors, and naturally spoke with a Spanish accent. After winning the 1961 All-Star Game for the National League, for example, Clemente was quoted as: “I get heet. … When I come to plate in lass eening … I say I ’ope that Weelhelm [Hoyt Wilhelm] peetch me outside. …”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, reporters routinely corrected grammatical mistakes in English for white players. Clemente refused to remain silent. He pushed back when a reporter called him a “chocolate-covered islander.” “You writers are all the same,” he shouted at one critical reporter. “You don’t know a damn thing about me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente was frequently hurt and sometimes required surgery. He suffered damaged discs, bone chips, pulled muscles, a strained instep, a thigh hematoma, tonsillitis, malaria, stomach problems, and insomnia. Even so, between 1955 and 1972 he played more games than anyone in Pirates history. Yet some sportswriters, teammates, and managers repeatedly accused him of being lazy or faking injuries if he missed a game. To the contrary, Clemente repeatedly played through pain, and excelled nevertheless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente was a proud Black man, Puerto Rican, and American. From 1958 to 1964 he served in the Marine Corps Reserve. Coming from Puerto Rico, a more racially integrated island, he was shocked by the segregation he encountered in mainland America, especially during spring training in the Jim Crow South. Black players on the Pirates during Florida spring training in the late 1950s and early 1960s couldn’t stay in the same hotels or eat in the same restaurants as their white teammates. While on the road, white teammates had to bring Black players’ food out to the team bus. Clemente refused to sit and wait on the bus. He demanded that the Pirates provide Black players with another vehicle so they could drive to Black restaurants where they would be served. He and other Black players were also excluded from the Pirates’ annual spring golf tournament at a local country club, while their white teammates participated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even some of his teammates used racial slurs when referring to Clemente and other Latino players. Clemente pushed the Pirates to hire more players of color. By the early 1970s, half the team’s roster was Black, Latino, or Spanish-speaking, and in 1971, for the first time in major league history, the Pirates fielded an all-Black and Latino lineup, thanks largely to Clemente.</p>\n\n\n\nRoberto Clemente smiles as he sits in the dugout during an MLB Spring Training game on March 7, 1957 at Terry Park in Fort Myers, Florida.  (Photo by Hy Peskin/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente played during the peak of civil-rights activism. He closely followed the movement and identified with its struggles. He witnessed a speech Martin Luther King Jr. gave at a Puerto Rican university in 1962. They later became friends and met often, including a long visit on Clemente’s farm in Puerto Rico, where they discussed King’s philosophy of nonviolence and racial integration. Clemente voiced these ideas both inside and outside the clubhouse. As teammate Al Oliver recalled: “Our conversations always stemmed around people from all walks of life being able to get along. He had a problem with people who treated you differently because of where you were from, your nationality, your color. Also, poor people, how they were treated.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After King was assassinated in Memphis on Thursday, April 4, 1968, Baseball Commissioner William Eckert announced that each team could decide for itself whether it would play games scheduled for the day of King’s funeral. On Friday, the next to last day of spring training, the Pirates’ 11 Black players (six of them also Latino) met at their hotel and agreed that they would refuse to play on Opening Day and the following day, when America would be watching or listening to King’s funeral. The following day, all 25 Pirates met at the ballpark and, after Clemente spoke, agreed to boycott their first two games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente and Dave Wickersham, a white pitcher, contacted Pirates general manager Joe Brown and asked him to postpone the season’s first two games or else the players would refuse to play. Then they wrote a public statement on behalf of their teammates that was published in the Pittsburgh Press the next day. They wrote: “We are doing this because we (white and black players) respect what Dr. King has done for mankind. Dr. King was not only concerned with Negroes or whites but also poor people. We owe this gesture to his memory and his ideals.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea spread and players on other teams followed their lead. Commissioner Eckert, his back against the wall, reluctantly moved all Opening Day games to April 10. No sportswriter at the time described the players’ action as a strike. But that’s what it was – a two-day walkout or wildcat strike, not over salaries and pensions, but over social justice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1969, Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood asked the Mayor League Baseball Players Association to support his lawsuit challenging the reserve clause, baseball’s version of indentured servitude, which made players properties of their teams. They could be traded to another team against their will, which is what happened to Flood. At Clemente’s urging, the players union held its annual executive committee meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Some players were skeptical about Flood’s lawsuit, but the tide turned after Clemente spoke out on Flood’s behalf. He declared that Flood was the only player with the courage to take on the owners and the reserve clause. “So far, no one is doing anything,” he said. The players voted unanimously to back Flood’s lawsuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente’s activism went beyond fighting against racism and for players’ rights. Besides sponsoring philanthropies to distribute food, medical supplies, and baseball equipment, Clemente routinely visited sick kids in hospitals and held frequent baseball clinics for low-income children. He campaigned to use sports to counter drug problems in Puerto Rico and elsewhere. Most ambitiously, he began building a Sports City in Puerto Rico, seeking to replicate it throughout the United States to provide athletics and counseling but also intercity and interracial exchanges to challenge all forms of discrimination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the 1963-64 offseason, Clemente developed a lasting bond with the Nicaraguan people when he played winter ball for the Senadores de San Juan, who represented Puerto Rico in the International Series in Managua, the country’s capital. Clemente became a fan favorite during the series, making many friends and pledging to return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 23, 1972, a massive earthquake devastated Managua. Over 7,000 people died, and thousands of others were injured. More than 250,000 people were left homeless. Back home in Puerto Rico, Clemente decided to help the recovery, using the media to organize a massive campaign of food, clothing, and medical assistance. Funded by Clemente, two cargo planes and a freighter began delivering the aid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Clemente found out that the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Jr. was siphoning off the international aid flowing into Managua (including $30 million from the United States) and stockpiling it for his corrupt government. For example, when a private American medical team arrived in Managua, it had to fight local Somoza officials from confiscating the supplies it brought. President Richard Nixon dispatched a battalion of US paratroopers to Managua, which only further helped Somoza loot the country. Nixon claimed he didn’t want the earthquake to provide opportunities for communists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente vowed to personally deliver the relief he had gathered. He believed that his presence would ensure that the aid would get to the people who needed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 31, 1972, the 38-year-old ballplayer boarded a broken-down and overloaded plane. Some warned him against making the trip, but he said, “Babies are dying. They need these supplies.” Several minutes after takeoff, the plane exploded and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing Clemente and four others.</p>\n\n\n\nRoberto Clemente takes a breather on the field during the 1960s. (Photo by Focus on Sport via Getty Images)\n\n\n\n<p>The Pirates retired Clemente’s number in 1973 and the Baseball Writers Association of America waived the normal five-year waiting period to elect Clemente to the Baseball Hall of Fame that year; he became the first Latino player ever inducted. MLB established an annual Roberto Clemente Award (for community service) and Roberto Clemente Day. In 2002, President George W. Bush posthumously awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1974 the Roberto Clemente Sports City opened in Puerto Rico and has since served hundreds of thousands of kids, including future major league stars Juan González, Bernie Williams, and Iván Rodríguez. Clemente has been honored by dozens of schools, hospitals, coins, stamps, post offices, bridges, parks, housing developments, ballparks, streets, and museums in his name in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Nicaragua.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Opening Day this year, Latinos (including U.S. players and those from Latin America) represented 28.5% of all players on major league rosters and 13% (four out of 30) of all big league managers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps if Clemente were still alive, he’d be drawing attention to the Costa Rican factory that is partly owned by Major League Baseball and where workers toil under sweatshop conditions to manufacture all 1.2 million baseballs used during a major league seasons</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Jackie Robinson, Clemente was an outstanding athlete and fierce competitor who used his celebrity to challenge baseball’s, and America’s, racism and to fight for better living and working conditions for everyone, regardless of race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente once observed: “If you have a chance to help others and fail to do so, you are wasting your time on this earth.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Peter Dreier is professor of politics at Occidental College and co-author of the forthcoming Baseball Rebels: The Reformers and Radicals Who Shook Up the Game and Changed America.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Elsa/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Recapping Friday’s game using Win Probability Added (WPA)</p> <p>As the Red Sox played at Great American Ball Park in front of just over 13,000 fans on Wednesday evening to see the lowly Reds improve to 59-91, there was another AL East vs NL Central matchup finishing up on MLB TV. A crowd of 46,175 stood for every pitch thrown by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the bottom of the eighth, as they willed the bottom of the Yankee order to turn that lineup over one more time with the hopes of seeing Aaron Judge stroll to the plate for another chance at history. Judge walked on four pitches while the crowd booed mercilessly, stuck on 60 home runs for the night, and the Yankees won 14-2.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t help but wonder if this mediocre-at-best Red Sox roster, playing out the string, would be prepared for the madhouse they’d be walking into for a four-game weekend series. With three of those four games on national television, the majority of that national audience isn’t tuning in to see you, but rather that 6’7’’, 282 lb., free-agent-to-be, gentle giant in the other dugout. The hope would be to see some positive signs out of the young guys with some experience playing in big games in September to be prepared for 2023 and beyond while seeing some pride out of the veteran pitchers against Judge to break that record somewhere else.</p>\n<p>On Thursday night, the Red Sox went down to the Yankees in the fifth inning, crawled back from three runs down, before losing 5 to 4 in extra innings. On Friday night, the Red Sox went down again in the fifth inning, crawled back again from three runs down, and lost again 5 to 4. This time, it was an eighth-inning single off the bat of Jose Trevino to hand Matt Strahm the loss and give New York their second straight win to open the series, and fifth straight win overall. Neither Michael Wacha nor Rich Hill allowed a hit to Aaron Judge, who is 1-for-6 (a single) with three walks in the series thus far, but the Red Sox have now lost three straight and sit at 72-78 with 12 games to play. </p>\n<p>The good news is there have been a few positive signs from the kids over these two nights. On Thursday night, Triston Casas hit his third home run of the season and Reese McGuire stepped up with a pinch-hit three-run, go-ahead home run a few batters later. On Friday, it was Casas again who looked like a polished hitter under the bright lights. He worked a seven-pitch leadoff walk against Gerrit Cole in the fifth inning, led off the seventh with another walk, and then stepped up and ripped a single into right field with one out in the ninth inning to get the tying run into scoring position. Rookie reliever Zack Kelly continued his hot start with a shutout inning and fellow rookie Kaleb Ort bounced back after suffering the loss the previous night also to throw a shutout inning in relief of Hill. </p>\n<p>As we test out a new idea in some of the game recaps at Over The Monster, we will be looking at Fangraphs’ Win Probability Added (WPA) metric, outlined in detail here. In short, WPA keeps a running tally throughout each plate appearance of how each player contributes to their team’s odds of winning, both positively and negatively. A clutch hit that increases a team’s probability of winning will add to the batter’s WPA while subtracting from the pitcher’s WPA. </p>\n<p>WPA is not subjective in any way, so I’ll give my Three Stars of the game to start and see how it compares to the algorithm. The First Star has to be Alex Verdugo for his three-run, two-out home run to tie the game in the 6th inning. After taking a two-strike pitch that was a millimeter out of the strike zone, Verdugo homered, and Gerrit Cole and Aaron Boone were both ejected moments later. I didn’t blame Cole for getting run; he was probably done for the night anyways and, “I gotta have it.” For the Second Star, I’ll roll with Tristan Casas who, as mentioned, was on base in three of his four key plate appearances. The Third Star might have gone to Tommy Pham for his first-inning solo home run but he gave that back with two of the worst throws from the outfield in modern baseball history in the 5th inning. I’ll instead go with Kaleb Ort who struck out both Aaron Hicks (2-for-3, HR, 2 RBI, 2 Runs) and Giancarlo Stanton in his shutout 7th inning while keeping Judge in the yard. </p>\n<p>Let’s see how WPA saw it. (Fangraphs Link)</p>\n<p>Game 150, September 23: Yankees 5, Red Sox 4</p>\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs\n  \n<p>Three Stars:</p>\n<p>1)     Alex Verdugo (.253 WPA). 2-4, HR, 3 RBI</p>\n<p>2)     Triston Casas (.197). 1-2, 2 BB, K</p>\n<p>3)     Kaleb Ort (.085). 1 IP, 1 H, 2 K. </p>\n<p>Three Duds:</p>\n<p>1)     Reese McGuire (-.262 WPA): 0-4, 1 K.</p>\n<p>2)     Matt Strahm (-.243): 1 IP, 1 H, 1 ER, 2 BB, 2 K. </p>\n<p>3)     Rich Hill (-.224):5 IP. 5 H, 4 ER, 4 BB, 2 K </p>\n<p>WPA Play of the Game: With two outs and two runners on in the top of the sixth and the Red Sox down 4-1, Alex Verdugo hit a three-run home run off of Gerrit Cole to tie the game.

        "description": "<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>This story first appeared at ProPublica. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The property management subsidiary of Jared Kushner’s family real estate company has agreed to pay a $3.25 million fine to the state of Maryland and to reimburse many of the tens of thousands of tenants in the Kushners’ Baltimore-area apartment complexes for excessive fees and for rent they were forced to pay over the past decade despite serious maintenance problems in the units.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The agreement represents the settlement of a 2019 lawsuit brought against the subsidiary, Westminster Management, by the Maryland attorney general. The state alleged that the company’s “unfair or deceptive” rental practices violated Maryland’s consumer protection laws and “victimized” people, “many of whom are financially vulnerable, at all stages of offering and leasing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is a case in which landlords deceived and cheated tenants and subjected them to miserable living conditions,” said Attorney General Brian Frosh, a Democrat, at a press conference announcing the settlement Friday morning in Baltimore. “These were not wealthy people. Many struggled to pay the rent, to put food on the table, to take care of their kids, to keep everybody healthy, and Westminster used its vastly superior economic power to take advantage of them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kushner Companies, which has since sold off most of the complexes, did not respond to requests for comment, but in a statement to the Baltimore Banner, it said: “Westminster is pleased to have settled this litigation with no admission of liability or wrongdoing. We look forward to moving past this matter so that we can focus on our ever-expanding real estate portfolio.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frosh took issue with that characterization. “You don’t pay three million two hundred and fifty thousand bucks if you’re not liable,” he said. “They may not have formally signed a piece of paper saying that they did it, but they did.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state lawsuit followed on the heels of a May 2017 article co-published by ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine describing the Kushner Companies’ highly litigious treatment of tenants at the apartment complexes it started buying in the Baltimore suburbs in 2012. The 17 complexes contained a total of about 9,000 units and provided a strong cash-flow ballast for a real estate company better known for trophy properties in New York.</p>\n\n\n\nThe Dutch Village apartment complex is seen on July 30, 2019 in Baltimore, Maryland. Dutch Village is one of several apartment complexes in the Baltimore area owned by President Donald Trump’s son in law and senior White House advisor Jared Kushner’s real estate company.  (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n<p>The article reported that the company had brought hundreds of cases against current and former tenants over unpaid rent and broken leases, including people who had moved out of the complexes before the Kushner Companies even purchased them. The company also pursued tenants who possessed evidence that they did not owe the money claimed, with all manner of court and late fees piling on top of the original claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article also described the shoddy conditions that many tenants had to contend with at the complexes, including mice, leaky roofs and rampant mold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Friday’s press conference, Frosh and two former tenants elaborated on the deplorable conditions. Frosh showed images from squalid units, including one of a large cluster of mushrooms growing beside a toilet. Tiffany Dixon described the floor and wall damage in her family’s unit at a Kushner complex called Commons of White Marsh that she said was caused by a large hole under the kitchen sink of an adjacent unit. Dixon recounted the horrifying discovery, after her kitchen stove stopped working, of mice remains inside the oven. Vaughn Phillips described living in a unit in another complex, Fontana Village, that had water pouring out of the kitchen wall for months “to the point where there was a small pond in my kitchen and living area.” Phillips also said that gas leaked from the unit’s kitchen stove and that “mice that would come out and watch TV with me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frosh displayed one of the many internal company emails that his office obtained during its investigation, showing that officials were well aware of the problems. “We desperately need your help at the Commons of White Marsh with the number of roof leaks that are still occurring due to the damage of the storm that was caused from the storm back in March,” the community manager at the complex wrote to the director of construction at Kushner Companies, in September 2018. “I am receiving at least 30 complaints per day and residents coming [in] and screaming in office. We have a large amount of drywall damage and potential for mold is becoming an issue.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the state’s lawsuit in 2019, a group of tenants filed a class-action lawsuit in late 2017, alleging that the company was improperly inflating payments owed by tenants by charging them late fees that are often unfounded and court fees that are not actually approved by any court. That case made its way to the state Court of Special Appeals in early 2021, but a ruling has not yet been issued. (The Kushner entities have denied wrongdoing in that suit.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state case against the company won a major victory in April 2021, when an administrative law judge found that Westminster violated consumer laws in several areas, including by not showing tenants the actual units they were going to be assigned to before signing a lease, and by assessing them a range of “spurious” fees. The ruling came after a 31-day hearing in which about 100 current and former tenants testified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company had initially downplayed the lawsuit as a politically motivated stunt to embarrass Kushner, the highly influential son-in-law of then-President Donald Trump. But after the ruling by the administrative law judge, the company entered into negotiations with the state. “It became very clear that they had done wrong and we were not going to let them off the hook,” Frosh said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frosh said that the state was looking into whether other large landlords in Maryland have been engaging in practices similar to those employed by Westminster. The Baltimore Banner recently reported that Maryland landlords are far more aggressive in using the courts to threaten eviction as a routine practice for collecting rent than are landlords in other states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the terms of the settlement, Westminster must make an effort to reach all of the estimated 30,000 tenants who resided in its Baltimore-area complexes to alert them that they may submit claims of restitution for rent they were forced to pay despite substandard conditions. Former tenants will be able to start submitting claims in three months and will then have a year to do so. The claims will then be assessed by a special master selected by the company with the approval of the state. Separately, the company will automatically reimburse former tenants for excessive court fees and late fees, based on its records; former tenants will not need to file claims for that restitution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Westminster may end up paying considerably more than $3.25 million, since there is no limit on the amount of restitution the special master can order. (Of the $3.25 million fine, $800,000 will be treated as a down payment on the restitution.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former tenants at the press conference expressed satisfaction with the settlement. “I wasn’t looking for financial gain,” Dixon said. “I was just looking for justice. I was looking for someone to acknowledge the negligence so that other people didn’t have to endure what we did.”</p>",

        "link": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/how-roberto-clemente-harnessed-celebrity-to-change-america",
        "description": "<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>This article is part of TPM Cafe, TPM’s home for opinion and news analysis. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>September 15 was not only the beginning of Hispanic Heritage Month but also Roberto Clemente Day. To honor the great Latino ballplayer, major league players wore his jersey number: 21. But the Tampa Bay Rays went further. On that day, for the first time in major league history, the Rays’ entire starting lineup was comprised of Latin American players – three from the Dominican Republic, two each from Venezuela and Cuba, and one each from Colombia and Mexico.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente was not the first Latino to play major league baseball, but he was the first Latino superstar. He saw that as both a responsibility and an opportunity. Like Jackie Robinson, he used his athletic celebrity to speak out on behalf of social and racial justice. And like Robinson, he faced racism and pushback from owners, fans, sportswriters, and even some fellow players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente had an impressive 18-year major league career (1955-72), during which he played solely for the Pittsburgh Pirates. He played in 15 All-Star games, won four batting titles, was named the National League’s Most Valuable Player in 1966, lead the Pirates to World Series championships in 1960 and 1971, reached 3,000 hits in his next-to-last game in 1972 (a feat surpassed by only 10 other major leaguers at the time), and had a lifetime batting average of .317, with 240 home runs, 1,305 RBIs, and 12 Gold Glove awards as best fielding outfielder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in 1934 in Carolina, Puerto Rico, Clemente starred as an all-around athlete in high school. His arm was so strong that he became an Olympic prospect throwing the javelin. But he loved baseball and signed with the Dodgers in 1954, at a time when there were few Black and few Latino players on major league rosters. After one year in the minors, the Dodgers sold Clemente to the Pirates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente fought constantly against negative stereotypes, prevalent at the time, of emotional and lackadaisical Latinos. He bristled over the racist way that sportswriters covered him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sportswriters and baseball card companies called him Bobby or Bob, instead of his preferred name, Roberto, while white players were always asked what they wanted to be called. Writers made fun of his accent, quoted him in broken English, and paid little attention to his powerful intellect and social conscience. He knew little English when he joined the majors, and naturally spoke with a Spanish accent. After winning the 1961 All-Star Game for the National League, for example, Clemente was quoted as: “I get heet. … When I come to plate in lass eening … I say I ’ope that Weelhelm [Hoyt Wilhelm] peetch me outside. …”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, reporters routinely corrected grammatical mistakes in English for white players. Clemente refused to remain silent. He pushed back when a reporter called him a “chocolate-covered islander.” “You writers are all the same,” he shouted at one critical reporter. “You don’t know a damn thing about me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente was frequently hurt and sometimes required surgery. He suffered damaged discs, bone chips, pulled muscles, a strained instep, a thigh hematoma, tonsillitis, malaria, stomach problems, and insomnia. Even so, between 1955 and 1972 he played more games than anyone in Pirates history. Yet some sportswriters, teammates, and managers repeatedly accused him of being lazy or faking injuries if he missed a game. To the contrary, Clemente repeatedly played through pain, and excelled nevertheless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente was a proud Black man, Puerto Rican, and American. From 1958 to 1964 he served in the Marine Corps Reserve. Coming from Puerto Rico, a more racially integrated island, he was shocked by the segregation he encountered in mainland America, especially during spring training in the Jim Crow South. Black players on the Pirates during Florida spring training in the late 1950s and early 1960s couldn’t stay in the same hotels or eat in the same restaurants as their white teammates. While on the road, white teammates had to bring Black players’ food out to the team bus. Clemente refused to sit and wait on the bus. He demanded that the Pirates provide Black players with another vehicle so they could drive to Black restaurants where they would be served. He and other Black players were also excluded from the Pirates’ annual spring golf tournament at a local country club, while their white teammates participated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even some of his teammates used racial slurs when referring to Clemente and other Latino players. Clemente pushed the Pirates to hire more players of color. By the early 1970s, half the team’s roster was Black, Latino, or Spanish-speaking, and in 1971, for the first time in major league history, the Pirates fielded an all-Black and Latino lineup, thanks largely to Clemente.</p>\n\n\n\nRoberto Clemente smiles as he sits in the dugout during an MLB Spring Training game on March 7, 1957 at Terry Park in Fort Myers, Florida.  (Photo by Hy Peskin/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente played during the peak of civil-rights activism. He closely followed the movement and identified with its struggles. He witnessed a speech Martin Luther King Jr. gave at a Puerto Rican university in 1962. They later became friends and met often, including a long visit on Clemente’s farm in Puerto Rico, where they discussed King’s philosophy of nonviolence and racial integration. Clemente voiced these ideas both inside and outside the clubhouse. As teammate Al Oliver recalled: “Our conversations always stemmed around people from all walks of life being able to get along. He had a problem with people who treated you differently because of where you were from, your nationality, your color. Also, poor people, how they were treated.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After King was assassinated in Memphis on Thursday, April 4, 1968, Baseball Commissioner William Eckert announced that each team could decide for itself whether it would play games scheduled for the day of King’s funeral. On Friday, the next to last day of spring training, the Pirates’ 11 Black players (six of them also Latino) met at their hotel and agreed that they would refuse to play on Opening Day and the following day, when America would be watching or listening to King’s funeral. The following day, all 25 Pirates met at the ballpark and, after Clemente spoke, agreed to boycott their first two games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente and Dave Wickersham, a white pitcher, contacted Pirates general manager Joe Brown and asked him to postpone the season’s first two games or else the players would refuse to play. Then they wrote a public statement on behalf of their teammates that was published in the Pittsburgh Press the next day. They wrote: “We are doing this because we (white and black players) respect what Dr. King has done for mankind. Dr. King was not only concerned with Negroes or whites but also poor people. We owe this gesture to his memory and his ideals.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea spread and players on other teams followed their lead. Commissioner Eckert, his back against the wall, reluctantly moved all Opening Day games to April 10. No sportswriter at the time described the players’ action as a strike. But that’s what it was – a two-day walkout or wildcat strike, not over salaries and pensions, but over social justice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1969, Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood asked the Mayor League Baseball Players Association to support his lawsuit challenging the reserve clause, baseball’s version of indentured servitude, which made players properties of their teams. They could be traded to another team against their will, which is what happened to Flood. At Clemente’s urging, the players union held its annual executive committee meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Some players were skeptical about Flood’s lawsuit, but the tide turned after Clemente spoke out on Flood’s behalf. He declared that Flood was the only player with the courage to take on the owners and the reserve clause. “So far, no one is doing anything,” he said. The players voted unanimously to back Flood’s lawsuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente’s activism went beyond fighting against racism and for players’ rights. Besides sponsoring philanthropies to distribute food, medical supplies, and baseball equipment, Clemente routinely visited sick kids in hospitals and held frequent baseball clinics for low-income children. He campaigned to use sports to counter drug problems in Puerto Rico and elsewhere. Most ambitiously, he began building a Sports City in Puerto Rico, seeking to replicate it throughout the United States to provide athletics and counseling but also intercity and interracial exchanges to challenge all forms of discrimination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the 1963-64 offseason, Clemente developed a lasting bond with the Nicaraguan people when he played winter ball for the Senadores de San Juan, who represented Puerto Rico in the International Series in Managua, the country’s capital. Clemente became a fan favorite during the series, making many friends and pledging to return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 23, 1972, a massive earthquake devastated Managua. Over 7,000 people died, and thousands of others were injured. More than 250,000 people were left homeless. Back home in Puerto Rico, Clemente decided to help the recovery, using the media to organize a massive campaign of food, clothing, and medical assistance. Funded by Clemente, two cargo planes and a freighter began delivering the aid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Clemente found out that the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Jr. was siphoning off the international aid flowing into Managua (including $30 million from the United States) and stockpiling it for his corrupt government. For example, when a private American medical team arrived in Managua, it had to fight local Somoza officials from confiscating the supplies it brought. President Richard Nixon dispatched a battalion of US paratroopers to Managua, which only further helped Somoza loot the country. Nixon claimed he didn’t want the earthquake to provide opportunities for communists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente vowed to personally deliver the relief he had gathered. He believed that his presence would ensure that the aid would get to the people who needed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 31, 1972, the 38-year-old ballplayer boarded a broken-down and overloaded plane. Some warned him against making the trip, but he said, “Babies are dying. They need these supplies.” Several minutes after takeoff, the plane exploded and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing Clemente and four others.</p>\n\n\n\nRoberto Clemente takes a breather on the field during the 1960s. (Photo by Focus on Sport via Getty Images)\n\n\n\n<p>The Pirates retired Clemente’s number in 1973 and the Baseball Writers Association of America waived the normal five-year waiting period to elect Clemente to the Baseball Hall of Fame that year; he became the first Latino player ever inducted. MLB established an annual Roberto Clemente Award (for community service) and Roberto Clemente Day. In 2002, President George W. Bush posthumously awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1974 the Roberto Clemente Sports City opened in Puerto Rico and has since served hundreds of thousands of kids, including future major league stars Juan González, Bernie Williams, and Iván Rodríguez. Clemente has been honored by dozens of schools, hospitals, coins, stamps, post offices, bridges, parks, housing developments, ballparks, streets, and museums in his name in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Nicaragua.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Opening Day this year, Latinos (including U.S. players and those from Latin America) represented 28.5% of all players on major league rosters and 13% (four out of 30) of all big league managers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps if Clemente were still alive, he’d be drawing attention to the Costa Rican factory that is partly owned by Major League Baseball and where workers toil under sweatshop conditions to manufacture all 1.2 million baseballs used during a major league seasons</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Jackie Robinson, Clemente was an outstanding athlete and fierce competitor who used his celebrity to challenge baseball’s, and America’s, racism and to fight for better living and working conditions for everyone, regardless of race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clemente once observed: “If you have a chance to help others and fail to do so, you are wasting your time on this earth.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Peter Dreier is professor of politics at Occidental College and co-author of the forthcoming Baseball Rebels: The Reformers and Radicals Who Shook Up the Game and Changed America.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Republican gubernatorial nominee Tudor Dixon (Mich.) joked on Friday at two separate events about the foiled kidnapping plot against her opponent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For someone so worried about getting kidnapped, Gretchen Whitmer sure is good at taking business hostage and holding it for ransom,” Dixon said at a campaign event in Troy, Mich., according to video posted by an Associated Press reporter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The sad thing is that Gretchen will tie your hands, put a gun to your head and ask if you are ready to talk.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two men were convicted last month for kidnapping conspiracy and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction in the plot to kidnap Whitmer. The men now face maximum sentences of life in prison, CNN reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr., along with two other individuals who pleaded guilty, allegedly arranged the plot in retaliation against the governor’s COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a second event on Friday, Dixon laughing alongside Donald Trump Jr. at one of Whitmer’s facial expressions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The look on her face was like, ‘Oh, my gosh, this is happening. I’d rather be kidnapped by the FBI,’” Dixon said, referring to an appearance Whitmer made with President Biden at the Detroit Auto Show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conservative political commentator, who was endorsed by former President Trump in the gubernatorial primary, denied that her first comments about the kidnapping plot were “a joke” after criticism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m like, ‘No, that wasn’t a joke.’ If you were afraid of that, you should know what it is to have your life ripped away from you,” she told her audience at the second campaign event, according to CNN.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michigan Democrats condemned Dixon’s comments about the kidnapping, with Whitmer’s spokesperson calling the Republican “absolutely unfit to serve in public office.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Threats of violence and dangerous rhetoric undermine our democracy and discourage good people on both sides of the aisle at every level from entering public service,” spokesperson Maeve Coyle told CNN.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Threats of violence — whether to Governor Whitmer or to candidates and elected officials on the other side of the aisle — are no laughing matter, and the fact that Tudor Dixon thinks it’s a joke shows that she is absolutely unfit to serve in public office.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democratic Governors Association spokesman Sam Newton called on the DeVos family, political giants in Michigan who are backing Dixon for governor, and the Republican Governors Association to “condemn her dangerous extremism.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Multiple people were convicted in a domestic terrorist plot to kidnap the Governor and Tudor Dixon thinks it's a laughing matter,” he wrote. “Dixon is too dangerous and completely unfit for office.”</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3658549-financial-inclusion-for-the-unbanked-could-ease-us-economic-woes/",
        "description": "<p>Across rural America and in urban centers throughout the country, there is a little-known roadblock to economic growth and personal prosperity that is keeping millions of people from achieving financial independence and building personal prosperity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people are “unbanked” and lack a bank account, while others are “underbanked” and need to use alternative financial services such as money orders, check-cashing services and payday loans rather than traditional loans and credit cards to manage their finances and fund purchases. Both situations block millions of people across the nation from personal financial stability and hurt our overall economic growth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite significant progress in the last decade toward reducing the number of underbanked and unbanked people in the United States, there is a growing bipartisan consensus that now is the time to redouble our efforts toward true financial inclusion. Financial inclusion must go beyond banking to have a tangible impact on the financial lives of people in America. Financial inclusion means that individuals and businesses have equitable access to affordable financial products and services to meet their payments, savings, credit and insurance needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is why over 110 companies, trade groups, and consumer groups have joined with the Aspen Institute Financial Security Program, calling for establishing a National Financial Inclusion Strategy to deliver better financial outcomes for all people, whatever their zip code. This unprecedented coalition brings together a large number of diverse entities advocating for a national financial inclusion strategy. It represents the comprehensive array of sectors and policies that must be addressed in a cohesive approach. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For too long, the U.S. has taken a fragmented approach to financial inclusion. Federal agencies, financial institutions, community organizations and advocacy groups have led important individual initiatives to address the lack of inclusive financial systems in the United States, but there has been no cohesive, strategic effort to address this very complex problem.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Biden administration’s executive order making support for racial equity within underserved communities a top priority for federal agencies was a good first step, but the data show that more action is needed.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, more than 7 million households across the U.S. remain unbanked and are disproportionately Black, Hispanic, American Indian, or Alaska Native. Nearly 10 percent of rural Americans lived in “banking deserts” compared to 1.7 percent of urban Americans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just rural Americans who are left behind. In a 2020 report conducted by McKinsey, data reveals that exclusionary policies and strategies — from limited access to federal mortgage lending to geographic barriers to physical bank branches — have hindered Black economic wellbeing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, recent research finds Black and Latino households account for over half of interest and fees on payday loans (22 and 29 percent, respectively), despite comprising less than a third of the population. A report from New America found that financial institutions charge Latino consumers $262 more to open a checking account than their white counterparts.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research from the International Monetary Fund shows a 2-3 percentage point GDP growth difference over the long term between financially inclusive countries and their peers. The United States trails other countries because it lacks a comprehensive financial inclusion strategy, but a Presidential Commission can set joint goals for federal agencies and the private sector to expand financial inclusion policies, develop ongoing means of coordinating action between leading agencies and organizations, and track progress toward building an inclusive financial system in the U.S.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizations across the political and philosophical spectrum have realized that our national failure to create a coordinated strategy to promote financial inclusion hurts the individuals impacted and limits our financial growth. A recent analysis of multiple sources by McKinsey &amp; Company estimates that promoting financial inclusion could translate into 4 to 6 percent higher growth in real GDP by 2028.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solving this intractable program requires bold leadership across all sectors to establish a shared vision for how policies, products and business models can create the inclusive financial systems required to generate an equitable and sustainable economy.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This recommendation is the culmination of several years of research and dialogue with the leading voices in the financial services industry and those who have been systematically excluded. It's time to put all people in America on the path toward better outcomes and create greater financial security for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ida Rademacher is vice president of the Aspen Institute and executive director of its Financial Security Program.  </p>",

        "description": "<p>The White House condemned a Friday ruling in Arizona that allowed the state’s abortion ban to be enforced, saying that it will set women in the state back “more than a century.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Saturday that the potential consequences of the ruling are “catastrophic, dangerous, and unacceptable.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ban, which was originally passed in the 1800s before Arizona became a state and has been blocked since the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, forbids abortion in all cases except for when the life of the pregnant person is at risk. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If this decision stands, health care providers would face imprisonment of up to five years for fulfilling their duty of care; survivors of rape and incest would be forced to bear the children of their assaulters; and women with medical conditions would face dire health risks,” Jean-Pierre said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An Arizona judge ruled on Friday that the state could enforce the ban, as it was only blocked because of the court’s ruling in Roe. More than a dozen states have had trigger bans go into effect or passed legislation banning abortion since the court’s June ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned the federal right to abortion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Protecting abortion rights has become a key issue as Democrats vie to keep control of Congress in the November midterm elections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republicans, who have largely focused their attention on the economy and criticizing high inflation, were performing better in the generic congressional ballot and in certain individual races before Roe was overturned, and Democrats have closed the gap since then. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polling has shown abortion access is one of the top issues on voters’ minds, trailing the economy as the top issue, but by a smaller margin than before June. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), have sought to distance themselves from Sen. Lindsey Graham’s (R-S.C.) proposal to ban abortion federally after 15 weeks of pregnancy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Graham said on Tuesday that abortion is “not a states’ rights” issue, but Senate Republicans told The Hill that they support letting the decision be made at the state level. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jean-Pierre said in her Saturday statement in reference to the Arizona ban, “Make no mistake: this backwards decision exemplifies the disturbing trend across the country of Republican officials at the local and national level dead-set on stripping women of their rights, including through Senator Graham’s proposed national abortion ban.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jean-Pierre said President Biden and Vice President Harris will continue to work to pass legislation to codify the abortion rights that Roe protected into federal law.</p>",

        "link": "https://blog.ayjay.org/two-versions-of-covid-skepticism/",
        "description": "<p>From a long, intricate, subtle, and necessary essay by Ari Schulman:</p>\n\n<p>The skeptical type I have targeted here is not the one who believes merely that prolonged school closures were a travesty (which is true), that natural immunity should have counted as equivalent to vaccination (true), that an egalitarian view of the virus meant that too little was done to protect people in nursing homes (true), that with different choices, restrictions could have ended far sooner than they did (true again).</p>\n<p>No, he was the one who gave himself over wholly to Unmasking the Machine. Starting from entirely reasonable frustrations, the skeptical project took its followers to dark places. The unmasker insisted a million of his countrymen would not die and then when they did felt no reckoning. He at one moment cast himself as Churchill waiting to lead us out of our cowering fear of the Blitz (Death is a part of life) and in the next said that actually the Luftwaffe is a hoax (Those death certificates are fake anyway). He feels no reckoning because he has been taken in by a force as totalizing as the Technium’s; he is so given over to it that he too no longer accepts his own agency.</p>\n<p>This skeptic is no aberration. An entire intellectual ecosystem is fueled by his takes. He owns, if not the whole movement of the Right, then certainly its vanguard.</p>\n<p>Yet still, still one can hear the reply: Corrupt powers lied and demanded ritual pieties and put their boot on our necks and tore the country apart, and you want a reckoning from us?</p>\n\n<p>An understandable reply — but the answer is, Yeah, we’d like a reckoning from you skeptics, because in a well-functioning society people don’t demand accountability and responsibility only from their political opponents. </p>\n<p>At the heart of Ari’s essay is a simple yet essential distinction between two phenomena: (a) skepticism about the competence and integrity of our technocratic public health regime and (b) skepticism about the seriousness of the coronavirus. Those who were right about the former all too often allowed themselves to be drawn into the latter. And very few of those who were most dismissive of the dangers posed by Covid have admitted their error — they’re too busy taking a “victory lap” because they think — with, as Ari shows, a good deal of justification — that they were right about the self-serving turf-protecting rigidity of the regime. </p>\n<p>(And if you don’t think National Review can be trusted with regard to the profound shortcomings of that regime, then by all means read Katherine Eban’s many illuminating and distressing reports in Vanity Fair.) </p>\n<p>As I look back on my own scattered writings on this topic, I think I often made the opposite error: because I rightly took seriously the dangers of the coronavirus, I was often too trusting of the regime. </p>",

        "title": "Why the new Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 is worth the money to upgrade versus the original [VIDEO]",
        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/lenovo-chromebook-duet-3-versus-older-version/",
        "description": "<p>With the introduction of a few new ChromeOS tablets in the past year, it can be easy to get a little confused on which one to pick up if you are in the market for a detachable Chromebook. But the brutal truth at this point is the only Chromebook tablets worth considering come from Lenovo, and that means one of the toughest decisions for anyone reading this right now comes down to the differences present in the older Lenovo Chromebook Duet and the newer Duet 3.  They look a lot alike and come with many of the same features; but don’t be fooled by the lower price of that older model.  Instead, let me show you why in every way, you should really consider an upgrade to the newer Duet 3…even if it costs a bit more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, a quick note about the two most-recent Lenovo tablets on the market: the Duet 3 and Duet 5.  Both are great devices that meet different needs, and we’ve fleshed those differences out in a video prior to this one.  They have different strengths and weaknesses and though they are the only two Chromebook tablets I’d fully recommend here in the second half of 2022, there’s a pesky fly in the ointment that has consumers being pulled towards a third option that – in my honest opinion – doesn’t need to even be in consideration in most circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, there’s one caveat to that, but we’ll save it for the end.  Outside of this single factor, there’s simply no reason for anyone to even remotely consider spending money on the original Duet.  Don’t get me wrong: it was a fantastic device back in 2020 and it single-handedly did more for detachable Chromebooks than any device has to date.  It brought together the parts you want in a tablet – like a great display, portable size, solid build, and a keyboard in the box – and kept the price (the MSRP price) in a range that made it such an easy purchase decision right as we rolled head-first into a pandemic.  It handily got my kids through online, at-home school for sure, and I’d bet it did the same for some of you, too.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter in every single way\n\n\n\n<p>But this is tech, and tech moves fast.  As we head into the latter parts of 2022, the playing field has changed a bit, and the newer and better-in-every-way version of that beloved Duet has arrived.  And it’s really fantastic!  We talked about it in our review, but the story is pretty simple, here: if you loved what the original Duet brought to the table, the new one does all of that and more.  And it does it all better!  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t have to meticulously go through every spec and hardware feature to make my point, but I’ll mention a few things that clearly make the Duet 3 a better tablet than its predecessor.  First, the screen is a tad larger at 11-inches, giving you the same portable feel and a better workspace.  The processor is far faster with the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2, making actual work much, much easier to get done.  The keyboard is better spaced and more comfortable, the trackpad is larger with a better click, the kickstand back plate is thinner, the port selection is better, the external monitor support is better, the battery life is better…you get the idea.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In almost every single category, the new Duet 3 trumps the older version.  I called it a perfect update in my review, and I still stand by that.  Lenovo absolutely nailed every part of upgrading this device, addressing all of the concerns most people had with a $300 tablet.  Is it perfect?  Of course not, but it is pretty fantastic if you are looking for a 10-11-inch tablet and want ChromeOS running on it.  </p>\n\n\n\nThe price at the register\n\n\n\n<p>So why would anyone consider buying the older model?  You know the answer before I say it, right?  It comes down to price: and herein lies our caveat.  As an older device, the original Duet can be discounted a bit more aggressively and that makes for some interesting decisions at the time of purchase.  Right now, Best Buy has the original Duet at the full $299 MSRP and the new Duet 3 marked down $50 to $329.  In no realm of reality should you consider the original Duet in this circumstance.</p>\n\n\n\n\nBuy the Lenovo Duet 3 at Best Buy\n\n\n\n\n<p>However, there have been a few times where the original Duet has dipped to half off, and that really muddies the waters a bit.  It doesn’t happen all that often, but if the old Duet was $149 and the new Duet 3 wasn’t on sale and sitting at $379, the conversation shifts quite a bit.  In this scenario, we need to ask: who will be using the tablet?  What will its main use case be?  Are you OK with its processor struggling, with typing being below average and really cramped, with the tablet/keyboard combo being a bit bulky?  If you’re fine with all the trade-offs, go get your deal and enjoy the purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But most times, we find these two devices within $100 of one another, and if you plan on keeping your new tablet around for a few years, you really have to ask yourself if saving $60, $70, or $80 is really worth the trade-offs you’re agreeing to in the moment.  It would be different if we were just talking about a few upgrades here and there, but I’m telling you this new tablet is better in every single way versus the one that came before, and that’s not an exaggeration in the least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when we discuss the two devices at MSRP, the difference in price is $80, and there’s no situation where I’d tell you to save $80 and pick up the older version.  The upgrades are simply too numerous to overlook and you’d regret your decision a few months down the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My recommendation?  Find a way to buy the newer Duet 3 if it is at all possible and if the older model isn’t on some sort of fire sale.  You won’t regret it, I promise.  The difference between the two isn’t iteration: it is near complete overhaul, and all for the better.  We made this post and video to point out that specific fact and to make it very clear that although these tablets do bear a passing resemblance, they couldn’t be more different in actual use.  If you plan on using either for an extended period of time and want to actually get productive at all with it, I can’t urge you enough to go for the Duet 3.  You’ll thank me later.</p>\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>The Cubs win their fourth straight with a 6-5 triumph over the Pirates.</p> <p>I don’t quite know what we are witnessing. I can confirm I’m spelling the name right since photos of Esteban Quiroz populated the search menu when I typed it in. I want to think he’s the most random Cub in my lifetime. But that’s going to be wrong. It works for the back story. Nothing about Quiroz’ journey suggested any meaningful time in the majors. But, as for the actual performance? At least one or two Cubs come through every year who have less memorable stints as a Cub. </p>\n<p>For instance, I open up Baseball Reference and look at these guys: Locke St. John, Conner Menez, Nicholas Padilla, Eric Stout. Who among these Cubs who have appeared in games but didn’t etch their name into Heroes and Goats are you going to remember a year from now? Two? Five? Ten? </p>\n<p>I’ll admit to not following the fine work of Josh Timmers the way I did several years ago. I go into it every time he posts before I do, which is more often than not. But, I’m guilty of skimming for the names I recognize. So I won’t pretend to tell you how many of the names in the previous paragraph are guys who could maybe still see more time on this team in the future. And certainly Quiroz would ordinarily be one of those guys. </p>\n<p>That’s not the story unfolding, though. I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that no player’s first four appearances in H&amp;G were exactly: Kid, Sidekick, Hero, Superhero, in that order. But that’s exactly what Quiroz has now done. He has climbed Mount H&amp;G. I’m not sure I even ever thought if it like that before. Oh, I’ve recognized a guy who makes contributions but never seems to win the Superhero. But this is different. </p>\n<p>It’s the most different because in each instance, I thought, “This is it. This is the pinnacle for him.” First, it was he got into a game and got enough of a leverage opportunity to appear in this space. Then it was a small contribution, then a bigger contribution and now WPA says he’s the player of the game. You’ll all get a chance to weigh in on that opinion a bit later, but me first. </p>\n<p>I go to the box score and who is my first star of the game? I see one pitcher I’m going to recognize. And I see three options among the hitters. P.J. Higgins, I see you. Four times on base and a run scored, I’m not passing completely over that. But, I’m going to do it. I’m giving into Esteban-mania. Two hits, a walk, two runs driven in, one of those was ultimately the game winner, a run scored. Table setters are great, but Quiroz drove in two in key situations. I think he’s the legit top star of this one. </p>\n<p>I can’t pass on P.J. entirely. A pair of singles, a pair of walks and a run scored. I hope Higgins has carved out a bit of a career for himself this year. He has not at any point embarrassed himself. Not by any standards of mine. </p>\n<p>Patrick Wisdom had a nice line too and for all of you who’d have him in your three, I get it. But for my third star, I’m going to recognize the most impressive of the pitching performances. When Michael Rucker took over in the fifth, the Cubs were down two. The wins and losses don’t matter that much at this point, but if he doesn’t hold the line, this one is going to the birds. He threw a perfect fifth and then worked around a leadoff walk to throw another scoreless inning in the sixth after Quiroz had given them the lead the first time. </p>\n<p>Now let’s go to WPA and see how it saw this one. </p>\n<p>Game 151, September 23: Cubs 6 at Pirates 5 (66-85)</p>\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs\n  \n<p>Reminder: Heroes and Goats are determined by WPA scores and are in no way subjective.</p>\n<p>THREE HEROES:</p>\n\n\nSuperhero: Esteban Quiroz (.286). 2-4, 2RBI, BB, CS\n\nHero: Erich Uelmen (.198) IP (6 batters), H, 2BB, K (Sv 1)\n\nSidekick: Patrick Wisdom (.184). 1-3, HR, 2RBI, 2R, BB, 2K\n\n<p>THREE GOATS:</p>\n\n\nBilly Goat: Javier Assad (-.266). 4IP (20 batters), 4H, 3BB, 4R (3ER), 2K\n\nGoat: David Bote (-.158). 0-4, BB, 2K\n\nKid: Alfonso Rivas (-.085). 1-5, K\n\n<p>WPA Play of the Game: Erich Uelmen’s strikeout of Calvin Mitchell with two outs and the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth. Now that’s quite a first MLB save. (.271)</p>\n<p>*Pirates Play of the Game: With one out in the bottom of the seventh, Bryan Reynolds homered off of Manuel Rodriguez to tie the game 5-5. (.240)</p>\n\n<p>Rizzo Award Cumulative Standings: (Top 5/Bottom 5)</p>\n<p>The award is named for Anthony Rizzo, who finished first in this category three of the first four years it was in existence and four times overall. He also recorded the highest season total ever at +65.5. The point scale is three points for a Superhero down to negative three points for a Billy Goat.</p>\n\nDavid Robertson +22.5\nChristopher Morel +18\nNico Hoerner +17.5\nScott Effross +17\nJustin Steele/Willson Contreras/Drew Smyly +10\nRowan Wick -10.5\nNelson Velazquez -11\nRafael Ortega -11.5\nYan Gomes -14\nJason Heyward -15.5\n\n<p>Up Next: Game three of the four-game set. The Cubs will look for a fifth consecutive win. They’ll have Wade Miley (1-1, 3.48) on the mound. Wade is trying to show teams that he can be both healthy and effective as he heads back into free agency. He’ll be opposed by Johan Oviedo (3-2, 3.69). Oviedo’s been effective for the most part when the Pirates have called on him. This will not be a pushover. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>Taylor Ward homered twice and Shohei Ohtani took a no-hitter into the fifth inning, helping the Los Angeles Angels beat the Minnesota Twins 4-2 on a cool, rainy Friday night.</p><p>Ohtani seemed to have trouble adjusting to the weather conditions, tying his career high with six walks. He also hit a batter in the first, when Minnesota scored without a hit, but he managed his way through five-plus innings to earn his fourth straight win.</p><p>Ohtani (14-8) allowed two runs and struck out seven to reach 203 Ks on the season, reaching 200 for the first time in his career. He’s the first player in MLB history to have 200 strikeouts and hit at least eight home runs in the same season.</p><p>“It’s a big milestone for me,” Ohtani said through an interpreter of reaching 200 strikeouts. “It just shows that I’ve been able to consistently take the mound every fifth or sixth day.”</p><p>While Ohtani is in the MVP discussion after winning the award last year, Angels interim manager Phil Nevin believes the Japanese right-hander should also be considered for the Cy Young award.</p><p>“I think he’s right in that talk,” Nevin said. “He’s going to get there with the innings, I think. Personally, there’s nobody better I want. There’s nobody I want on the mound more if I want to win a big game. I certainly think he should be in the discussion.”</p><p>Ohtani added an RBI single in the seventh for Los Angeles. Ryan Tepera got three outs for his fourth save.</p><p>The Twins (73-78) lost for the eighth time in nine games. The team also announced that All-Star outfielder Byron Buxton is done for the season and will have surgery on his troublesome right knee.</p><p>Luis Arraez singled with two outs in the fifth for Minnesota’s first hit of the game.</p><p>“I was actually reasonably pleased that we didn’t just go out there just swinging,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"We actually made him get back in the zone and make some pitches.”</p><p>Rookie Louie Varland (0-2), a Minnesota native making his first MLB start in his home state, gave up three runs in 5 2/3 innings in his third career start for the Twins.</p><p>“It was nerve-wracking, still very exciting,” Varland said, noting he left 41 tickets for family and friends and that there could have been 200 friends and family in attendance. “After everything’s done with, it was a lot of fun. It was unreal.”</p><p>The first-pitch temperature was 53 degrees and rain fell throughout the early innings. The grounds crew had to repair the mound several times but the game was never delayed.</p><p>Ohtani settled down after a shaky first, allowing just three baserunners over the next four innings. At one point, he struck out five batters in a row before Arraez’s hit to the opposite field with the infield shifted.</p><p>“I was having some trouble with my landing spot,” Ohtani said. “I was afraid I might slip a little bit. But this is going to happen in the future, so something I need to get used to and just keep on working on.”</p><p>The first four batters reached in the sixth, and Jake Cave singled in Nick Gordon for Minnesota’s second run. But Aaron Loup relieved Ohtani and got a strikeout and a double play to end the threat.</p><p>Trainer’s room</p><p>President of Baseball Operations Derek Falvey said the team has not closed the door on a return for 2B Jorge Polanco, who is out with left knee inflammation. ... Falvey said he’s also hopeful that OF Max Kepler, out with a right wrist sprain, can return this season. ... OF Trevor Larnach, who was playing rehab games after core muscle surgery, is now dealing with wrist soreness.</p><p>Up next</p><p>LHP Reid Detmers (6-5, 3.71 ERA) starts on Saturday for Los Angeles. RHP Joe Ryan (12-8, 3.61 ERA) takes the mound for Minnesota.</p>",

        "description": "Amsterdam Nursing Home, courtesy of their website.\n<p>By Gretchen Berger</p>\n<p>The New York State Health Department has confirmed four deaths out of eight cases of Legionnaires’ disease in the west wing of the 409-bed Amsterdam Nursing Home, located on Amsterdam Avenue and West 112th Street in Morningside Heights.</p>\n<p>Two deaths from the disease were reported a week ago by the New York Times. Seven of the eight residents diagnosed with Legionnaires’ had developed symptoms between late August and early September. There was a fifth death, but the cause is still under investigation, a Health Department spokesman told the Times. The ages of the eight infected residents range from 69 to 93. The source of the infections in the building has not yet been determined, according to the state.</p>\n<p>Legionnaire’s disease is a severe form of pneumonia caused by the Legionella bacteria.  It spreads primarily through mist, such as from air conditioning units for large buildings; by inhaling contaminated water droplets; or by accidentally swallowing water containing Legionella into the lungs. It is not spread person-to-person. Older adults and people with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Since 2015, NY State has required cooling towers on buildings to be registered, regularly inspected, and tested for Legionella. Regulations require that health-care facilities perform annual Legionella culture sampling and analyses for drinking water systems. Amsterdam Nursing Home’s spokesman Jacomowitz says it has been fully compliant. But, out of five cooling-tower system inspections, the Amsterdam Nursing Home has been cited twice for violations since 2017, according to city data reported in The Times. A 2017 violation was for a new cooling tower that was not adequately cleaned or disinfected before use. In March 2021, they received another violation for failing to collect and analyze a Legionella sample. The most recent inspection in October 2021 showed no violations.</p>\n<p>“Every passing is a tragedy,” Jacomowitz said. “Our hearts go out to the families and all of their loved ones.”</p>\n<p>Amsterdam Nursing Home is managed by Centers Health Care, a Bronx-based long-term care company that operates about 50 skilled nursing and rehab facilities in the Northeast and Midwest.</p>",

        "description": "Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Aaron Judge is making history, simply put.</p> <p>Regardless of what happens between now and the end of the year, history will remember the 2022 season as the year of Aaron Judge. Much was said about the extension offer, the Yankees’ superstar declined before the season, and the gamble he was placing on himself. That type of pressure could’ve derailed a lot of players’ seasons.</p>\n<p>Now, with a couple of weeks left in the regular season, Aaron Judge is very close to establishing the single-season home run record for an American League player, surpassing Roger Maris’ 61 mark.</p>\n<p>However, that’s not the only notable achievement that Judge is in line for in 2022, as he’s currently leading the race for the first Triple Crown since Miguel Cabrera in 2012. Judge has home runs and RBI locked up but finds himself in a fierce battle for the batting average lead in the AL that should go down to the wire, against Xander Bogaerts, and Luis Arraez.</p>\n  \n        \n      Kyle Thele\n  \n<p>Judge’s season is truly remarkable, and whatever final records he ends up setting after game 162 is over, this campaign will be remembered for quite a while.</p>\n<p>The Triple Crown remains firmly up in the air for Judge, because Bogaerts and Arraez are neck-and-neck with the Yankees’ outfielder in the leaderboards for batting average in the American League.</p>\n<p>However, according to the majority of Yankee fans, 60 percent to be exact, to reach 62 home runs — which at this point feels like a very likely outcome for Aaron Judge — would represent a more impressive achievement than to win the triple crown.</p>\n<p>The spirit of this poll is probably to compare Judge’s record-setting season with a more standard Triple Crown campaign. It’s all the more impressive that whether Judge wins the Triple Crown or not, at this point he’s going to come very close to it, one way or another, and likely with those 62 home runs.</p>\n  \n        \n      Kyle Thele\n  \n<p>Aaron Judge’s 10.7 fWAR is the biggest mark in the American League and a remarkable number that you often won’t see on any given season, and to give some perspective, Paul Goldschmidt, right now the favorite for the NL MVP has a 7.1 fWAR. Judge’s gap to Goldy is over 50 percent of his total.</p>\n<p>The mere thought of bringing up a poll about who should win the AL MVP would legitimately feel insane, if not for the workings of the biggest unicorn the baseball world has ever seen.</p>\n<p>Shohei Ohtani is showing that last year was far from a fluke and continues to put up bona fide All-Star numbers as both a starter and a designated hitter. In spite of Ohtani’s marvelous campaign, Judge at least according to our national poll is the likely MVP winner of the AL with 77 percent of the voters saying they think he’ll take home the award, his first, as he finished runner-up to José Altuve in 2017.</p>\n  \n        \n      Kyle Thele\n  \n<p>With the season coming down the stretch, it’s a good time to look at the major awards, and what are the expectations from the fans as far as potential winners.</p>\n<p>The 2022 season has seen a lot of remarkable campaigns, but with still roughly 20 or so games left to be played, there isn’t a lot of intrigue about who will take home the individual trophies, at least not as far as the fans are concerned.</p>\n<p>Both Paul Goldschmidt and Justin Verlander received 64 percent of the votes, believing they’ll win the NL MVP and AL Cy Young, respectively. While Sandy Alcantara will win the NL Cy Young according to 53 percent of voters, there’s no clear No. 2 like Dylan Cease is in the AL (with 29 percent of votes), as Max Fried has 18 percent and Julio Urías 14 percent of votes.</p>\n<p>Adley Rutschman is giving the Orioles everything they’ve dreamed of, and probably some more, but that hasn’t stopped 84 percent of voters from believing that Julio Rodríguez will take home the AL Rookie of the Year trophy.</p>\n<p>The future is bright in Atlanta, as the Braves have the two biggest candidates for the NL Rookie of the Year, with a close race, at least as far as our poll is concerned, with 45 percent believing it will be Spencer Strider, and 37 percent in Michael Harris II.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by David J. Griffin/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Well, perhaps for one organization...</p> <p>If we played a Family Feud type game where a survey of 100 people were asked to name their least favorite day of the week, a good many would likely say “Monday” or “Tuesday”. It is highly possible you might get some to say “Sunday”, especially if that means you are seeing the end of the weekend. What is likely not to be at the top of the list is “Saturday”. Named for the Roman god of time (Saturn), Saturdays are generally a day of rest/non-work for most of the baseball following world. It is part of the Jewish Sabbath (Friday at sundown to Saturday at sundown) and a major day for sporting events (college football, baseball, pro soccer).</p>\n<p>However, there is one group of people out there who would answer the Feud question with no hesitation with “Saturday”. That would be the Houston Astros. In particular, the 2022 variant of the team has no love loss for this particular day of the week. On one hand, it could be hard to see why Houston might feel that way. Saturdays are typically one of the best days for fans to come out and see ball games. The game times can vary from day to night. The more fans attend, the greater exposure, the greater revenue streams, and the greater opportunity to put more money in everyone’s bank accounts. Especially if it is a good matchup, more fans can add to the excitement, making for a great game all across the board. That can be quite the fun occurrence. </p>\n<p>Not for the Houston Astros. For them, Saturday is a day of mourning. For a team that is all but assured to cross the 100 win plateau for the 4th time in 6 years, Saturdays wouldn’t figure to be any better or worse than any other day of the week. Then one just has to look at the schedule:</p>\n<p> 2022 Houston Astros Saturday Results.pdf</p>\n<p>Yep, for a team that is winning over 65% of its games, the Houston Astros somehow find a way to lose 66% of its Saturday contests.</p>\n<p>Why Saturdays? Is there some common factor/thread as to why the Astros struggle on Saturdays? </p>\n\n10 Games against playoff contending teams: 3-7\n12 Games against division rivals: 5-7\n12 Road Games: 3-9\n10 Home Games: 4-6\n\n<p>You can run through the table and extrapolate from the matchups, but no matter how you slice it, the Astros just really don’t seem to play well on Saturdays. Is there a particular reason why Saturdays are back for Houston? None that obviously appear. A number of Saturday games will get primetime/marquee attention from the networks, and there are times when the Astros will struggle in such matchups, but given their post-season successes, the spotlight is not that damaging to the squad. There is a decent mix of playing playoff contenders and also-rans, divisional games, interleague games, night/day games, etc. You name the team, and if they plays the Astros on a Saturday, you would be fine to mark a “W” in Sharpie. </p>\n<p>There is one rather significant exception to the struggles on Saturdays. It might be the signature game for the 2022 Astros. We are talking about the Saturday, June 25 matchup against the vaunted New York Yankees, the team which at the time was on pace to be the greatest team of all time. That day saw Houston deliver its 2nd combined no-hitter against the Yankees in team history.</p>\n  \n        \n      Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n      For Saturday, all was right with the universe (at least for baseball)\n  \n<p>With the regular season winding down, the Astros will finish their 2022 slate well under .500 on Saturdays. Matchups at Baltimore and against Tampa Bay remain in the regular season. Given that both are still fighting for playoff positions/post-season chances, and with the Astros in more of a position to prep for the playoffs vs. regular season achievements, you would not be out of place to bet on the opponents winning (if you are in to that sort of thing). </p>\n<p>As for the playoffs, where the Astros will be heading after Monday’s results, there are 4 Saturday games that could involve Houston:</p>\n\nALDS Game 4 (If Necessary): Oct 15\nALCS Game 3: Oct 22\nWorld Series Game 2: Oct 29\nWorld Series Game 7 (If Necessary): Nov 5\n\n  \n        \n      Photo by Austin McAfee/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n      Saturday World Series games weren’t all that great for Houston the last time either...\n  \n<p>Anyone else who cheers for Houston a tad uncomfortable about seeing two World Series games on Saturday, should the Astros make it that far?</p>\n<p>It could mean nothing, the rather inexplicable reason that the league-leading Astros are bottom-feeders on Saturdays. Maybe they want that to be their day of rest? Maybe other teams are jumping at the chance to play Houston on a Saturday big-matchup? Still, in what has been one of the stronger seasons in Astros’ history, that little footnote about Saturday struggles is quite the outlier. For fans, hopefully it will just remain a strange outlier and signify nothing more.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Atlanta needs to find a way to get the offense going in order to avoid its fourth-straight defeat. </p> <p>Kyle Wright and the Atlanta Braves will try to stop the bleeding Saturday when they continue their series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Atlanta dropped its third straight game Friday night in lopsided fashion falling 9-1. The loss dropped the Braves 2.5 games behind the New York Mets in the NL East standings. </p>\n<p>Atlanta will turn to Wright Saturday in hopes of avoiding its first four-game losing streak of the season. Wright allowed eight hits, two runs and struck out seven in his last start against Washington. He will also be chasing a bit of history Saturday. While pitcher wins don’t carry the same weight as they did in the past, Wright is looking to become Atlanta’s first 20-game winner since Russ Ortiz in 2003. </p>\n<p>The Phillies will counter with left-hander Bailey Falter who will be facing the Braves for the second straight start. He started against Atlanta last weekend and pitched well allowing four hits, two walks and one run before exiting after 4 2⁄3 innings. Falter has allowed three runs or less in seven straight starts. </p>\n<p>The Braves need to find a way to jumpstart a slumping offense that has managed just three runs combined in its last three games. Atlanta has just one extra-base hit, an Austin Riley double Friday night, during that span. The Braves have left 16 men on base and are 0-for-10 with runners in scoring position in the two losses to the Phillies. </p>\n<p>Ronald Acuña Jr missed his second straight game Friday with a sore back. The Braves say that he is day-to-day and his status for Saturday’s game is unknown. </p>\n<p>Saturday’s game is scheduled to get underway at 4:05 p.m. ET and can be seen on Bally Sports South. </p>\nGame Info\n<p>Game Date/Time: Saturday, September 24, 4:05 p.m. ET</p>\n<p>Location: Citizens Bank Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</p>\n<p>TV: Bally Sports South</p>\n<p>Streaming: MLB.tv</p>\n<p>Radio: 680 AM / 93.7 FM The Fan</p>",

        "description": "John Sleezer/Kansas City Star/Tribune News Service via Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>J.J. Picollo’s mentor will no longer be looking over his shoulder. But can he step out from Dayton Moore’s long shadow to become his own GM?</p> <p>The thing I’ve been calling for almost since the day I started writing here in 2016 has finally happened. I take no pleasure in Dayton Moore losing his job, but sometimes people and the roles they are employed in just aren’t good matches and it’s better for everyone to move on. That, at least, was the case here. I’ve long argued that Dayton Moore’s philosophies as General Manager were outdated and not improving. I’ve long argued that the team’s success from 2013-2015 had more to do with luck than good scouting or player development. </p>\n<p>That said, it’s about time I come to terms with the fact that Dayton Moore was almost certainly what Kansas City needed when owner David Glass hired him. As a condition of taking the job he required that the team begin running like a true major league franchise with intentions of competing again. For all I think the team was incredibly lucky in the good years, requiring the owner to spend a comparatively reasonable amount of money on salary, scouting, and player development paved the way for that good luck to happen. His predecessor, Allard Baird, was probably a better judge of talent but was never able to get the team to spend money in a way that supported his efforts. </p>\n<p>All else being equal, a more talented GM might have led the Royals to more winning seasons. However, all else was not equal. Dayton Moore might have been the only GM who could have taken over the team as it was in 2006 and gotten it to the playoffs EVER. So, thanks for that.</p>\n<p>Now, of course, it’s time to move on regardless. J.J. Picollo has inherited the big seat. What can we expect to happen next?</p>\nOther staff changes?\n<p>I went on record on the Royals Review podcast earlier this week that if Dayton Moore did get removed from his position that Cal Eldred and Mike Matheny would lose their jobs. I’m not going to back off of that now. There may be other changes in the front office but those are harder to predict in part because we know even less about what their specific jobs entail than we do a manager and pitching coach.</p>\n<p>I’d also expect the entire pitching development system to see an overhaul. Things have been so awful in that area that J.J. </p>\nPlayer acquisition changes?\n<p>John Sherman made a point during the press conference that was reiterated in Sam McDowell’s piece about the front office changes in the Kansas City Star that the team has gotten better at collecting data but needs drastic improvement in making that data available and using it in decision-making. Picollo is supposedly completely on-board with that idea and that’s the biggest thing that’s supposed to make him different from Moore. Most damning was the remark Sherman made while emphasizing the importance of using data in decision-making that he didn’t want to hear anecdotes anymore. If Dayton Moore was making signings, trades and other roster decisions based primarily on anecdotes things may have been far worse than I had even imagined. That is no way to make an important decision!</p>\n<p>The rumors circulating around the club are that Terry Bradshaw was fired because Picollo said it was time for that change and that the move wouldn’t have happened if Moore had had his way. Other rumors have suggested that the Royals made more trades near the deadline this year because Picollo was starting to get his way more when it comes to player transactions. If those rumors can be believed, we should expect a more transactional GM in J.J. Picollo.</p>\n<p>It now seems far more likely that Hunter Dozier and Ryan O’Hearn will be playing for different franchises come opening day 2023 than had Dayton Moore remained with the club. One report I saw suggested the team might go out and look for two more starting pitchers in free agency. If they do so, I would expect those pitchers to have better peripheral numbers and perhaps weaker obvious counting stats than in previous years. Think fewer signings of Jason Hammels and more signings of Charlie Mortons.</p>\nPhilosophical changes?\n<p>Dayton Moore’s greatest strength was also his greatest weakness. He was loyal to a fault. Whatever else I think of him, I have to respect that at least a little. Sure, his loyalty led him to do things like hang on to Trey Hillman, Cal Eldred, Ryan O’Hearn, and Ian Kennedy when he probably shouldn’t have. But it also led him to give Zack Greinke room to deal with his health issues. It led him to stick with Mike Moustakas even though he struggled mightily in 2014. It led to the Royals being the only team to refuse to furlough any front office staff or cut any minor leaguers during 2020.</p>\n<p>I don’t know how much it helped the team win, but I do know that, in general, I’d rather see people treated humanely than not. In fact, part of my issue with the way the team has handled Ryan O’Hearn is that it doesn’t seem particularly fair to him, either. Everywhere he looks, people are insulting and begging for him to be cut. If he went elsewhere, he might have a chance to rebuild his value and find a fan base that could appreciate him. Instead, the Royals have stubbornly clung to him out of a misguided sense of loyalty and fear that he’ll make them look stupid if he succeeds elsewhere.</p>\n<p>There’s been a lot of talk about how different can J.J. Picollo be after spending so much time working for Dayton Moore. But I do wonder if perhaps working so closely with Moore might have helped Picollo learn some things not to do. I hope J.J. can continue to make positive choices for the people who work under him and show them loyalty when appropriate. I also hope he’s watched how Moore’s version of loyalty has not only held the team back at times but ruined careers at others. Moore was loyal, yes, but he also sometimes made decisions out of fear and called it loyalty.</p>\n<p>John Sherman has made it clear that there are no infinite leashes on his team. Accountability will come for you if you don’t succeed or improve. I fully expect that the team will improve its scouting and development processes under Picollo or Picollo will soon be replaced as well. However, even if the Royals fail to significantly improve their scouting or prospect development under Picollo’s watch, if they can keep making decisions out of loyalty without the fear that characterized so much of Moore’s reign, I think this can still be a hugely positive change for the Royals.</p>",

        "description": "Bernie’s Chalet. American Family Field. May 1, 2021. | Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n    \n\n  <p>The conclusion of the interview with the tour guide of both American Family Field and Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, WI, who happens to work where David Vassegh was injured.</p> A Conversation of the Road\n<p>The Interview Series where I talk to people who spark my curiosity or make me interestingly examine my views.</p>\n\n<p>Holy crap! Holy crap!! Holy crap!!! HOLY CRAP!!!</p>\n<p>-David Vassegh, August 17, 2022.</p>\n\n<p>In the minor miracle that you do not know what I am talking about, on the morning of August 17, after my mother and I had left for Chicago to return to Fresno and San Francisco, respectively, Dodgers reporter David Vassegh had a date with the Bernie’s Chalet Slide at American Family Field. Apparently, he had been quite eager to go undertake the Bernie’s Slide Experience, where one can pay $150-$175 for the opportunity to go down the massive, 175-foot slide at American Family Field (up to five times) on game day.</p>\n<p>The following video pretty much shows what happened next:</p>\n\n\n<p>David Vassegh tried out the Brewers slide.<br /><br />Now he's heading for an IL stint  <br /><br />  @JomboyMediapic.twitter.com/aZYqg3MTnO</p>— The Athletic (@TheAthletic) August 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, comedy ensued, six cracked ribs and a broken wrist that will require surgery ensued. But believe it or not, there is actually more to this story than just the video of Mr. Vassegh injuring himself. </p>\n<p>Before we wrap up the conversation I had with Nick Pesch, two things need to be known for context. First, my initial reaction to Mr. Vassegh’s injury was “of course that happened to Vassegh.” Admittedly, my friends and family have the same reaction to things that I do - “oh, of course, Michael did/said that.” In that instance, game recognizes game. Ever since, Mr. Vassegh came on my radar after losing a footrace with Adrian Gonzalez, which Mr. Vassegh provoked, I admittedly have not been a fan of Mr. Vassegh’s work, which colored my initial response to this event, which I now regret.</p>\n<p>Second, I will applaud the Dodgers players for tending to Mr. Vassegh as if he were a member of the team in the moments directly after his injury. Bill Plaschke of the Los Angeles Times noted what the Dodgers did on the day of the accident on August 29:</p>\n\n<p>Humiliated and hurt, Vassegh was taken by Dodgers director of player relations Juan Dorado to the Dodgers’ training staff, who arranged for him to visit a nearby urgent-care center because the stadium X-ray technician had not yet arrived. Knowing the media rules, Vassegh retreated to a seat outside the Dodgers clubhouse while waiting for a co-worker to give him a ride.</p>\n<p>“There’s still that line where I’m not a player, and there’s no way I was going to wait in that clubhouse,” Vassegh said.</p>\n<p>At which point, Justin Turner, David Price, Cody Bellinger and Austin Barnes showed up and erased that line. They dragged him into the clubhouse. They cared for him until his ride arrived. They looked at him in his moment of crisis and saw more than just a microphone.</p>\n\n<p>Per Mr. Plaschke, Price grabbed a towel to wipe the sweat from Mr. Vassegh’s face, Turner gave Vassegh a chicken sandwich so he wouldn’t have to be medicated on an empty stomach, and Barnes and Alex Torres, the Dodgers’ clubhouse manager, helped Mr. Vassegh take off his shirt and tie and fitted him with a Dodgers T-shirt so that doctors would have easier access to his torso. We often overlook empathy and I will not do so here. </p>\n<p>It is worth noting that the slide video of Mr. Vassegh’s injury was the second time he went down the slide on August 17. As you can see below, he went down the slide a few minutes earlier, before his infamous ride, with no issue.</p>\n\n\n<p>HE WENT DOWN TWICE!!! THIS IS NOT THE SAME RIDE!!!! pic.twitter.com/IG9QXWcbdE</p>— 2022 World Series MVP Clayton Kershaw (@BoyslnBIue) August 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Now with all that background information, let us return to the conversation with Nick Pesch.</p>\n\n<p>Michael J. Elizondo (MJE): Just some ground rules, I am going to be direct in my questions as to this topic because I did personal injury law for two years and some habits are hard to break. I want to be clear that I am not seeking to blame anyone or get anyone in trouble. I only care about what you know and fully acknowledge that you are not an expert. I also fully acknowledge that you are not a spokesman for the Milwaukee Brewers, nor is anyone trying to say that you are. I just want to know what you know. Does that sound fair?</p>\n<p>Nick Pesch (NP): Sure thing.</p>\n<p>MJE: Elephant in the room questions first: were you present the day that David Vassegh went down the slide? Do you have any firsthand knowledge of what happened to David Vassegh?</p>\n<p>NP: No, I was not present when David Vassegh went down the slide. However, I did see videos of him going down the slide.</p>\n  \n        \n      Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n      While in the Media Room. American Family Field. August 16, 2022.\n  \n<p>MJE: Okay, fair enough. Now stepping back a minute, you said that you give regular ballpark tours and run tours at Bernie’s Slide. What does a tour at Bernie’s Slide look like?</p>\n<p>NP: Anyone who wants to go down the slide needs to have already paid for a game ticket and paid the fee for the slide tour, which is $150 on weekdays and $175 on weekends. There is also a waiver that needs to be signed. </p>\n<p>Then, that person shows up a couple of hours before the first pitch and they have the option to go down the slide up to five times and we will take photos of them going down the slide. Usually, people do not go down all five times, but after someone is done with the slide, I can take them on a truncated ballpark tour. Usually, I take people to Bob Uecker’s booth in the press box or the Bob Uecker statute on the upper level. Either way, once Bernie the mascot shows up to the slide, the tour is over.</p>\n<p>MJE: Good to know. Let’s put a pin in the Uecker talk for a second. Have you ever personally gone down the slide at American Family Field?</p>\n<p>NP: Yes, I have gone down about 35 times at this point.</p>\n<p>MJE: Wow. Okay, have you ever been injured going down the slide?</p>\n<p>NP: No. I’ve gotten the occasional friction burn from the slide, but that’s it.</p>\n<p>MJE: Have you ever had someone go down the slide while you running a tour get injured?</p>\n<p>NP: No, but occasionally, someone gets a friction burn at worst. I have never had someone get as injured as Mr. Vassegh while I was running the Slide Tour. </p>\n<p>MJE: That’s good to know. If I understand you correctly, all I have to do to go down the slide is pay my fee, have a ticket to that day’s game, sign the waiver, and show up?</p>\n<p>NP: The slots for the slide tour are limited, but yeah, that sounds about right. All I can add is while on the tour, I will demonstrate how you position yourself to go down the slide safely. I will also give you a burlap mat as protection and a way to increase friction going down the slide.</p>\n<p>MJE: You have met me. Let’s do a hypothetical: imagine we’re at the slide, how would you tell me how to go down it?</p>\n<p>NP: First, I would advise you to wear long sleeves and pants before coming so there’s less risk of a friction burn. Then I would advise you to lie back and cross your arms over the chest and tell you to keep the burlap sack under you. I have noticed that if you sit up, you tend to speed up. The main thing to remember is that you need to use your legs as shock absorbers because you are going to hit that wall at the bottom. If you do everything I have said, you should have a fun time and be ready to go again if you want.</p>\n<p>MJE: Based on what you have seen and your personal experience, do you have a reaction to Mr. Vassegh’s slide where he injured himself?</p>\n<p>NP: Yes, I think you’re being too hard on him. I’m not quite sure how he picked up so much speed. Clearly, his sitting up and his size worked against him, but apart from where he got out of position, he wasn’t necessarily doing anything wrong. Sometimes accidents happen. I think the Brewers were a little hard on [Mr. Vassegh] too, putting that tape on the wall the next day.</p>\n<p>[Author’s note: I pointed out to Nick that the Brewers did not have anything to do with the tape, recounting the tale of Gavin Lux and his encounter with the right field wall at Dodger Stadium last year. I suspected that Justin Turner was the culprit as he had an alternate angle of Mr. Vassegh going down the slide. A subsequent tweet confirmed my hunch.]</p>\n\n\n<p>#HolyCrap #VasseghsChalet @THEREAL_DV   pic.twitter.com/hKrwrAvYQV</p>— Justin Turner (@redturn2) August 18, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>MJE: Is there any reason that David Vassegh should not attempt to go down the slide again if he wants to?</p>\n<p>NP: Not at all. He clearly was able to do it once. You did call him a doofus though, so you two should have a “slide off” next year at the ballpark with Bernie Brewer officiating and judging the slides like a gymnastics competition. [laughs]</p>\n<p>MJE: That genuinely sounds like a truly terrible idea! With our combined luck, we’re probably both ending up in the emergency room. That said before I switch to Bob Uecker, is there anything else about Bernie’s Slide that we have not covered that you feel we should cover?</p>\n<p>[Author’s Note: That truly is a terrible idea, but if the Dodgers want to pay my airfare to Milwaukee in early May 2023, we can probably work something out. Otherwise, I am fairly sure that both David Vassegh and I have better things to do.]</p>\n<p>NP: Just that a lot of people pay the fee to go down the slide but do not actually go through with it. We help folks stage photos to make it look like they have gone down the slide because they did pay for the experience. As I said, I usually take folks to the press box, or to Bob Uecker’s office.</p>\n<p>MJE: Have you had much interaction with Bob Uecker?</p>\n<p>NP: Not personally. He’s our Vin Scully. He’s a great ambassador for the City of Milwaukee and introducing new players to the area. He even can park his car inside the stadium; not even the owner can do that. Plus, he has a statute in Section 422, based on those old Miller Lite Commercials.</p>\n<p>[Author’s Note: Case in point.]</p>\n\n<p>MJE: I do not remember seeing it when I sat up there when I went to American Family Field. I’ll have to look for it when I come back. Thanks for your time, Nick. Anything to add before I close this out?</p>\n<p>NP: Yes, I hope to see folks come out to American Family Field. I enjoy giving tours, both of the ballpark and of Bernie’s Slide. I just hope that the Slide does not become a publicity stunt due to what happened to Mr. Vassegh. Thank you so much for reaching out to me and letting me share my story!</p>\n<p>MJE: My pleasure.</p>\n\n  \n        \n      Michael Elizondo / TrueBlueLA\n      Nick Pesch, Adric, and me. American Family Field. August 16, 2022.\n  \n<p>And thus, we conclude another Conversation of the Road. I hope you enjoyed this one, and please keep an eye out for the next time we stop for a conversation with someone I have met on the road.</p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "Seven expert and unexpected tips for people who have already tried everything<br /><br /><br /><br /><p>As a sleep coach, I regularly meet people who have “tried everything” to get more sleep. They have read every article on the subject and devoured every tip on the internet and then adjusted and readjusted their routines based on the advice they have found. Many of them are doing all the right things – spending time winding down before bed, curbing screen time, meditating – but still they struggle. The problem is that when it comes to sleep, unlike almost every other area of life, effort is not rewarded. In fact, it is actively punished. The more you try, the less you are likely to succeed.</p><p>This is because sleep is a passive process, like breathing or digesting. It cannot be controlled and nothing we can do can force it to happen. If we can stop trying, sleep will naturally follow. But not trying to sleep is extremely hard, especially when you are exhausted and desperate. Instead, I get my clients to shift their attention towards the main causes of sleeplessness: lack of sleep drive and hyperarousal. Tackling these two factors (which happily respond very well to a bit of effort) can then create the right conditions to allow sleep to happen all on its own.</p> Continue reading...",

        "description": "<p>Some Republican senators are privately expressing misgivings over Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R) provocative decision to ship migrants from Texas to liberal enclaves such as Martha’s Vineyard.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>GOP lawmakers acknowledge sending planeloads of migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, where former President Obama recently bought a house, plays well on Fox News and will likely ingratiate the Florida governor with Republican primary voters if he runs for president in 2024.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the idea of shipping migrants thousands of miles across the country to Martha’s Vineyard — an island off of Massachusetts with only 17,000 year-round resident and hardly enough housing even for seasonal summer workers — without any advance notice to local authorities, to make a political point, leaves some GOP lawmakers feeling uncomfortable.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One Senate Republican critic who requested anonymity to comment candidly on DeSantis’s Martha’s Vineyard gambit said it shows how much politics has changed since then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush (R) made his brand “compassionate conservativism” before the 2000 election.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It plays well to the base, but I just think of the humanity of it,” said the GOP senator. “It fires up a certain set of voters, but it turns another set of voters off.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The immediate media focus is on the shipping of people,” added the senator, referring to the critical media coverage of DeSantis and other Republican governors such as Texas Gov. Greg Abbot and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, who have sent migrants to Chicago and Washington, D.C.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Reuters-Ipsos poll published Friday showed that only a third of Americans think it’s appropriate for Republican governors to fly or bus migrants to other states. Half of the Republicans polled and only 1 in 6 Democrats said it was OK. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty-nine percent of Republicans and 55 percent of Democrats say they opposed the practice, according to the survey of 1,005 adults. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.), a leading voice in Congress on immigration issues, said DeSantis’s aggressive tack would wind up turning off middle-of-the-road voters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said laws may have been broken and that he would monitor how Republican governors are treating the migrants.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“More information is coming out. In fact, a lawsuit has been filed against him for alleged misrepresentations to these people. I’m just going to stay tuned and let the facts develop before making any legal conclusion,” he said.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is exploitation at its worse,” he added. “The MAGA Republicans will glory in this kind of outrageous conduct but normal, sensible, independent [people] I’m sure will see through it.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), another leader on immigration issues, said there may be cause for Congress to investigate whether DeSantis improperly used federal COVID-19 relief money to fly migrants around the country.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second Republican senator called DeSantis’s decision to ship migrants from Texas “a little strange” because they were outside his state’s jurisdiction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The senator added that Abbott, the Texas governor, who is also seen as a potential presidential candidate, “has been more cautious,” because he’s only sent migrants from his own state and hasn’t sent them any of them to Martha’s Vineyard, a destination that seemed designed to provoke liberals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discomfort felt by some Senate Republicans was voiced publicly by former Trump White House senior advisor Jared Kushner, the former president’s son-in-law, who said it was “very troubling” to see DeSantis use 48 Venezuelan migrants as “political pawns.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I personally watch what’s happening and it’s very hard to see at the southern border. I also — we have to remember these are human beings, they’re people,” Kushner told Fox News. “So seeing them being used as political pawns one way or the other is very troubling to me.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The growing controversy over whether it’s appropriate to ship migrants to Martha’s Vineyard or to Vice President Harris’s official residence in Northwest Washington, D.C., — as Abbott recently did — is creating some tensions in the Senate Republican Conference.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) praised the gambit last week as “a good idea.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GOP leader seemed pleased that the intense media focus on DeSantis had shifted some public attention to the huge influx of migrants at the southern border, an issue on which Republicans want to focus on ahead of the election, and away from the abortion debate, which has energized Democratic voters.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But other Republicans are stopping short of praising DeSantis, Abbott or Ducey in the same way.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she understands the frustration felt by border-state governors but that she’s proposing to pass legislation to allow migrants seeking asylum to work legally in the United States while their cases make their way through the courts, instead of sending them to states around the country with no clear way of supporting themselves.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I understand the frustration of border state governors because the border is completely out of control. We have 2 million unauthorized crossings in a year’s time. The administration really needs to take control of this issue and figure out how we can appropriately care for those who are crossing because they are fearing in their own country,” she said.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said allowing migrants seeking asylum to work while the legal process plays out would ease the burden on nonprofit groups and communities that are now caring for them. It takes nearly five years, on average, for an asylum case to clear the legal backlog.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A third Senate Republican who requested anonymity to discuss how DeSantis’s entry into the Texas border fray might play out politically and legally predicted the Florida governor would wind up with big legal bills.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Obviously to be in politics today you have to have enough campaign money to pay for lawsuits and lawyers,” the senator noted.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alianza Americas, a Chicago-based advocacy group representing migrants, this past week filed a lawsuit against DeSantis accusing him of organizing “a premeditated, fraudulent and illegal scheme” to advance his own political interests. The group is seeking to elevate the suit to class-action status.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeSantis is also facing a criminal investigation by the sheriff of Bexar County, the home of San Antonio, who says the Florida governor’s allies “lured” Venezuelan migrants onto the plane to Martha’s Vineyard “under false pretenses.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who is eyeing a potential run for president in 2024, defended DeSantis by accusing Sheriff Javier Salazar, a Democrat who was elected to his office in 2016, of playing politics.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think it’s silliness. Sheriffs are elected in Texas. It’s not the first time someone is looking for a headline, but it is not remotely criminal at all for someone to offer a private jet, a flight to fly someone voluntarily to a billionaire’s paradise,” he said, referring to Martha’s Vineyard.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other Senate Republicans are cheering on DeSantis and Abbott for putting Democrats on the political defensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said DeSantis doesn’t face any political risk over his gambit on migrants, even though he is already facing a criminal investigation and a civil suit.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“None, zero,” he said of the chance the politics might backfire on the Florida governor. “There are a bunch of liberals pushing back.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s good for him. The public’s with him. The public finds this, ‘Everybody, come into the country,’ insane,” he added. “I said in December of 2020 that immigration would be a bigger issue in 2022 than it was in 2020. Why? Because these policies are insane. There is no deterrence to coming by the millions now, with no end in sight. What Ron and Abbott are doing is trying to make this real to the most liberal groups in the country.”  </p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3656040-democrats-trump-is-evil-mantra-wont-work-this-november/",
        "description": "<p>Sitting on my patio recently, drinking a coffee to wake up, I opened Google on my phone and was greeted by a breathless headline: \"Trump supported a failed plot to replace Jared Kushner with Steve Bannon to lead 2020 campaign, Navarro book says.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I literally burst out laughing. “A failed plot.” Really?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somehow, a routine campaign consideration — one that many presidential campaigns in both parties have contemplated or initiated — had been turned into something out of “Seven Days in May.\" As someone who worked on three winning presidential campaigns (George H.W. Bush in 1988, George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004.), I’ve always understood that a candidate can hire and fire the campaign manager (and just about anyone else on his or her team) at will. No plots or subterfuge are needed, unless today’s presidential candidates don’t have the power they did back in my campaign days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look, I get it: Countless people on the left hate Donald Trump; many seemingly come unhinged, consumed by negative emotion, just at the thought of the former president. Yet, at what point will they let go and move on, not only for the good of their own lives but so they can help create commonsense solutions to the growing emergencies plaguing tens of millions of Americans?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realize many Democrats have come to believe that a Donald Trump on the loose represents a “clear and present danger” to the nation. One can only assume they were thrilled with the FBI raid on Trump’s Florida residence, a raid which may be the subject of committee investigations in the next Congress if Republicans win control of the House or Senate (or both) in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, with Halloween's approach in mind, their attempts to cast Trump as the political version of a scary movie’s zombie-like unvanquishable villain has become a one-trick-pony strategy — one that is growing old even with many other Democrats who actually hope to win elections in November and in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spoke very recently with a senior Democrat who felt the “fixation on Trump and Trump alone” will cost the party dearly in November and in the next presidential election. Said this person, in part: “Plenty of politicians in my party rightfully can’t stand Trump. But even voters who dislike Trump want to hear the Democratic Party outline how it plans to address the obvious issues negatively impacting everyone. Our national platform can’t just be ‘We hate Trump.’ ”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problems faced by Americans today are not imaginary. Many of us are being affected on a daily basis by quality-of-life-robbing issues that are real. Those within the bubble of entitled wealth fail to realize — or acknowledge — that few Americans can go to a Starbucks, break out their laptops, and get paid over six figures per year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not surprisingly, at least to anyone who is honestly paying attention, many of those Americans who are hurting the most today are, in fact, typically Democraticvoters living paycheck-to-paycheck or on fixed incomes. That is something most politicians — and most members of the media, academia, the corporate ranks of big business, and the upper ranks of the high-tech or entertainment communities — never have to worry about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of late, there have been a great many rhetorical assaults from the left on our founding documents, too. These same documents, of course, give big companies, journalists and celebrities the right to be liberal, far-left or “woke” — or to be singularly focused on vilifying one man at the expense of addressing the right-before-their-eyes issues breaking the will of working-class America.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Martha’s Vineyard wing of the Democratic Party can wall themselves off, evict inconvenient immigrants from their fields of vision, or escape to 5-star resorts. But a serious question for them arises: For how long? Because the circle of wealthy, entrenched entitlement within which they hide, and which protects them from the debilitating forces faced by the less fortunate, is shrinking by the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the vast majority of voters know, the rule of law matters; sovereign, protected borders matter; safe, drug-free streets matter; fossil fuels still matter; the education of our children matters, and the most basic of quality-of-life measurements still matter — even, ultimately, for the elites and their children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every single senior Republican I have spoken with in recent days is hoping against hope that the liberal “sound machine” continues to play only its one-hit wonder — “Trump is Evil.” For if it does, these Republicans (and a growing number of Democrats) believe the GOP will sweep back into power in Congress in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Douglas MacKinnon, a political and communications consultant, was a writer in the White House for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and former special assistant for policy and communications at the Pentagon during the last three years of the Bush administration. His latest book is “The 56: Liberty Lessons From Those Who Risked All to Sign the Declaration of Independence.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>NASA is postponing its scheduled Tuesday launch of its Space Launch System rocket for the Artemis I mission as a tropical storm moves toward the coast of Florida. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The space agency announced the delay in a statement after team members held a meeting Saturday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Officials will continue to watch the weather forecast coming with Tropical Storm Ian, which is expected to hit Florida as a major hurricane next week, and are preparing for a rollback, in which the rocket would be taken off the launch platform to the vehicle assembly building. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The delay is the third for the Artemis I mission that will see an unmanned spacecraft orbit the moon as the first step in a multiyear program through which people return to the moon’s surface for the first time in half a century. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>NASA delayed the launch first in late August and again earlier this month following technical problems. One of the rocket’s engines failed to condition to the correct temperature before the planned Aug. 29 launch, and engineers were unable to resolve a liquid hydrogen leak on Sept. 3. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>NASA said in its statement that engineers will make a final decision about the rollback on Sunday to allow them to receive additional data. The statement said the agency is taking a “step-wise approach” to allow it to protect its employees while also preserving the option to move forward with another launch opportunity if the weather improves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The agency previously announced after the two failed attempts that it would not try again until repairs were completed, which could take until October. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said at a press conference earlier this month, “We’re not going to launch until it’s right.” </p>",

        "description": "<p>The A’s announced that they have designated infielder Sheldon Neuse for assignment in order to open a roster spot for infielder Ernie Clement, who was claimed off waivers from the Guardians yesterday. The move drops Oakland’s 40-man roster count to 39.</p>\n<p>Neuse, 27, began this year in DFA limbo, as the Dodgers cut him loose on December 1, just as the lockout was about to begin. Shortly after the lockout ended in March, he was claimed off waivers by the A’s and has been oscillated between Oakland and Triple-A Las Vegas this year. He’s fared extremely well in Vegas with a .398/.407/.611 line across 25 games, but hasn’t been able to replicate that at the big league level. In 89 games for the A’s this year, he’s hit .214/.273/.288 for a wRC+ of 67.</p>\n<p>This has generally been the story of Neuse in recent years as both 2019 and 2021 also saw him post above-average marks in Triple-A but substandard results when in the show. In 147 career MLB games, he’s hit .212/.262/.296 while striking out in 29.8% of his plate appearances. Since the trade deadline has passed, the A’s will have no choice but to put Neuse on outright waivers or release waivers in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Another team might be tempted to put in a claim based on Neuse’s continued success at Triple-A. He is in his last option year and wouldn’t need an active roster spot for now, though he will be out of options next year. He also brings defensive versatility to the table, having appeared at all four infield positions this year, as well as spending some time in the outfield corners last year. If he finds a new home and clicks in a new jersey, he can be retained well into the future given that he just crossed one year of MLB service time here in 2022.</p>",

Gregor Chisholm of the Toronto Star pointed out in a Thursday opinion piece that in a scenario that sees the Jays go to a third game in the AL Wild Card Series, Berríos could find himself coming out of the bullpen.</p>\n<p>Berríos has not been the pitcher Toronto had hoped he would be since the club gave him the second largest contract in franchise history in terms of total value last offseason. Nearly a season into his seven-year, $131 million extension, the twenty-eight year old right-hander has struggled to turn out quality outings with any consistency. Excluding a rough rookie season, Berríos is posting career worsts in ERA, WHIP, K/9, HR/9, BABIP, and HardHit%. He is also not trending in the right direction, accumulating a 6.92 ERA in the month of August and conceding six earned runs in just two innings to the Rays on Thursday night.</p>\n<p>Alek Manoah and Kevin Gausman are the presumptive choices for the Jays’ first two games of the best-of-three Wild Card Series. If that series goes to a decisive third game, barring injury, manager John Schneider will likely face a choice between starting Ross Stripling, who has had an excellent 2022, or Berríos.</p>\n<p>More on other pitching situations from around the league…</p>\n\nWhite Sox righty Lucas Giolito is another tenured AL ace that has not pitched to his potential in 2022. His 5.05 ERA, 1.477 WHIP, and 9.9 H/9 are his worst since he broke out in 2019. After a September 16th start in which he gutted out 4 2/3 innings of one run ball, Giolito told James Fagan of The Athletic that his stuff was “obviously just like, not really there,” as it has been for most of the season. He continued on to cite a lack of fastball velocity as a chief contributor to his 2022 struggles. Giolito’s four-seam velocity has averaged 92.9 mph this season, a full 1.5 mph slower than his 2019 peak. The Sox can retain him for one more season via arbitration before he is scheduled to reach free agency as a 29-year-old, with Giolito surely hoping to find a way to have a better campaign in his platform year.\nNathan Eovaldi, who will be a free agent this offseason, alluded to his desire to re-sign with the Red Sox in an interview with Chad Jennings of The Athletic. “I love being here,” Eovaldi said. “It’s the front office, it’s the coaching staff, the training staff. Here, they all want to win.” It is unclear whether the 32-year old fits into Boston’s future plans. The Red Sox are on the precipice of a potentially turbulent offseason in which Eovaldi and DH J.D. Martinez are free agents and the contracts of superstars Rafael Devers and Xander Bogaerts have yet to be resolved. Boston’s uncertain future, in addition to the fact that Eovaldi spent so much of his 2018 pact with the Red Sox on the IL, casts some doubt on the notion that Red Sox will share Eovaldi’s interest in a reunion. However, with Rich Hill and Michael Wacha both headed into free agency as well, the club will certainly be looking to fill some rotation holes for 2023.\nReds lefty Mike Minor told Bobby Nightengale of the Cincinnati Enquirer that he is considering retirement at the conclusion of the 2022 season. “I’d have to feel good, and I’d have to want to play and want to be away from my family again,” Minor said. Three years removed from an All-Star nod with the Rangers, Minor battled injuries for the first two months of 2022. In total, he has thrown 98 innings to the tune of a 6.06 ERA for a non-competitive Reds team. Minor will face free agency this offseason should he elect to return to the big-leagues for a 12th year.",

        "description": "<p>Running training jobs across multiple nodes scales really well. A common assumption is that scale inevitably means slowdowns: more GPUs means more synchronization overhead, especially with multiple nodes communicating across a network. But we observed that the performance penalty isn’t as harsh as what you might think. Instead, we found near-linear strong scaling: fixing the global batch size and training on more GPUs led to proportional increases in training throughput. On a 1.3B parameter model, 4 nodes means a 3.9x gain over one node. On 16 nodes, it’s 14.4x. This is largely thanks to the super fast interconnects that major cloud providers have built in: @awscloud EC2 P4d instances provide 400 Gbps networking bandwidth, @Azure provides 1600 Gbps, and @OraclePaaS provides 800 Gbps.</p><p>— Linden Li</p>",

The fire occurred on a barge docked inside the shed that occupies the pier. According to the FDNY, two workers at the facility were transported to Mount Sinai West (Roosevelt) hospital with minor injuries.</p>\n<p>DSNY’s 59th Street Marine Transfer Station is used for loading paper for recycling from sanitation trucks into large open barges. The barges are brought by tugboat to a Pratt Industries recycling plant on the west shore of Staten Island, along the Arthur Kill, and made into cardboard boxes and other products. The West Side Rag wrote about the pier back in 2021.</p>\nFDNY engine at Pier 99 this morning.\n<p>DSNY Assistant Commissioner for Public Affairs Joshua Goodman confirmed there was a small fire at the facility and indicated that a total of five employees are reporting minor injuries. Once the FDNY has given the all-clear, the affected barge will be towed to Staten Island for an investigation to determine the cause.</p>\n<p>This is not the first time a barge has experienced a fire at Pier 99. In December 2021, a seemingly more serious fire resulted in four injuries.  A February 2022 article in Politico attributed that 2021 fire to a lithium battery which somehow wound up mixed in with the paper “creating a tinderbox”.</p>\nFDNY Marine units at Pier 99 after the fire had been extinguished.",

        "description": "<p>The decision is yesterday's West 49th St., LLC v. O'Neill, decided by New York Civil Court Judge Karen May Bacdayan. Scott Anderson and Markyus O'Neill lived together in an apartment; Anderson was on the lease, and O'Neill was not. After Anderson died, O'Neill would have had the right to renew the lease if he were \"a non-traditional family member,\" but Anderson was married to Robert Romano. The apartment building company therefore argued that O'Neill was just a roommate, but the court concluded that there needed to be a hearing about whether Anderson, Romano, and O'Neill were actually in a polyamorous relationship:</p>\n<p>Before gay marriage was legalized in any state, Braschi v Stahl Assocs. Co. (N.Y. 1989) was decided. The New York State Court of Appeals became the first American appellate court to recognize that a non-traditional, two-person, same-sex, committed, family-like relationship is entitled to legal recognition, and that the nontraditional family member is entitled to receive noneviction protections. The Braschi court interpreted the Rent Control Law in effect at a time when there was no legal recognition of same-sex marriage, and broadly construed the law to effectuate its remedial purposes.</p>\n<p>Braschi is widely regarded as a catalyst for the legal challenges and changes that ensued. By the end of 2014, gay marriage was legal in 35 states through either legislation or state court action. Obergefell v Hodges (2015), the seminal Supreme Court decision that established same-sex marriage as a constitutional right, was also heralded as groundbreaking. However, Braschi and its progeny and Obergefell limit their holdings to two-person relationships. The instant case presents the distinct and complex issue of significant multi-person relationships.</p>\n<p>The Braschi court held:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"The determination as to whether an individual is entitled to noneviction protection should be based upon an objective examination of the relationship of the parties. In making this assessment, the lower courts of this State have looked to a number of factors, including the exclusivity and longevity of the relationship, the level of emotional and financial commitment, the manner in which the parties have conducted their everyday lives and held themselves out to society, and the reliance placed upon one another for daily family services … These factors are most helpful, although it should be emphasized that the presence or absence of one or more of them is not dispositive since it is the totality of the relationship as evidenced by the dedication, caring and self-sacrifice of the parties which should, in the final analysis, control.\"</p>\n<p>The plurality, perhaps desiring not to go \"too far,\" concluded that \"the Legislature intended to extend protection to those who reside in households having all of the normal familial characteristics (emphasis added).\" Appellant Braschi should therefore be afforded the opportunity to prove that he and Blanchard had such a household.\" The dissent[ ]took issue with the plurality's legal analysis and suggested that it unreasonably strained reach its ultimate holding. \"… [W]e have no direct evidence of the term's [family] intended scope. The plurality's response to this problem is to turn to the dictionary and select one definition, from the several found there, which gives the regulation the desired expansive construction.\" However, had the Braschi court not extended itself to interpret the statute to provide noneviction protections to an unmarried same-sex couple, that community would have waited for over 20 years, when gay marriage was legalized in New York, to receive an equal opportunity to maintain housing stability after the death of a partner.</p>\n<p>In one of many incremental steps toward the legalization of same-sex marriage, shortly after Braschi was decided the legislature amended the Rent Stabilization Code to add evidentiary factors to be considered when determining whether a person has sufficient emotional and financial commitment to the former tenant of record to qualify for non-eviction protections. These factors, none of which are solely determinative, include, without limitation:</p>\n<p>1) \"longevity of the relationship;</p>\n<p>2) sharing of or relying upon each other for payment of household or family expenses, and/or other common necessities of life;</p>\n<p>3) intermingling of finances as evidenced by, among other things, joint ownership of bank accounts, personal and real property, credit cards, loan obligations, sharing a household budget for purposes of receiving government benefits, etc.;</p>\n<p>4) engaging in family-type activities by jointly attending family functions, holidays and celebrations, social and recreational activities, etc.;</p>\n<p>5) formalizing of legal obligations, intentions, and responsibilities to each other by such means as executing wills naming each other as executor and/or beneficiary, conferring upon each other a power of attorney and/or authority to make health care decisions each for the other, entering into a personal relationship contract, making a domestic partnership declaration, or serving as a representative payee for purposes of public benefits, etc.;</p>\n<p>6) holding themselves out as family members to other family members, friends, members of the community or religious institutions, or society in general, through their words or actions;</p>\n<p>7) regularly performing family functions, such as caring for each other or each other's extended family members, and/or relying upon each other for daily family services;</p>\n<p>8) engaging in any other pattern of behavior, agreement, or other action which evidences the intention of creating a long-term, emotionally committed relationship[.]\"</p>\n<p>This section further states, \"In no event would evidence of a sexual relationship between such persons be required or considered.\"</p>\n<p>Despite the documentary nature of many of the enumerated factors, \"absence of documentary evidence does not undermine a succession claim when the totality of the testimonial evidence … establishes the requisite emotional and financial commitment (emphasis added).\" …</p>\n<p>Why then, except for the very real possibility of implicit majoritarian animus, is the limitation of two persons inserted into the definition of a family-like relationship for the purposes of receiving the same protections from eviction accorded to legally formalized or blood relationships? Is \"two\" a \"code word\" for monogamy? Why does a person have to be committed to one other person in only certain prescribed ways in order to enjoy stability in housing after the departure of a loved one? Why does the relationship have to be characterized by \"exclusivity\"? Why is holding each other out to the community as a family a factor? Perhaps, as in the instant case, the triad has chosen to closet their relationship from others? Perhaps the would-be successor is not \"out\". Maybe they do not believe their \"real\" family is open to alternative kinds of relationships. \"Holding out\" discounts the existence of prejudice and misunderstanding about communities and people that are not \"normie.\" Do all nontraditional relationships have to comprise or include only two primary persons?</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Braschi court's referral to \"normal familial activities\" reveals an intent to limit the application of noneviction protections to someone who can demonstrate a traditional marriage but for their sexual orientation. The Braschi decision, heralded as a radical leap—a discouragingly accurate characterization given the decades that passed before gay marriage was legalized—was still decided in \"a relatively narrow and safe context.\" Paradoxically, the Braschi court's formulation of what comprises a nontraditional relationship is rooted in traditional ideology. {\"The intended protection against sudden eviction should not rest on fictitious legal distinctions or genetic history, but instead should find its foundation in the reality of family life. In the context of eviction, a more realistic, and certainly equally valid, view of a family includes two adult lifetime partners whose relationship is long term and characterized by an emotional and financial commitment and interdependence. This view comports both with our society's traditional concept of 'family' and with the expectations of individuals who live in such nuclear units…\".}</p>\n<p>However, what was \"normal\" or \"nontraditional\" in 1989 is not a barometer for what is normal or nontraditional now. Indeed, the definition of \"family\" has morphed considerably since 1989. Specifically, many articles have been written about multi-person relationships in recent years, revealing a preference that for some has long been known. For example, a recent article from The New Yorker magazine describes the broadening recognition of such relationships and how these relationships are challenging the norm:</p>\n<p>\"In February 2020, the Utah legislature passed a so-called Bigamy Bill, decriminalizing the offense by downgrading it from a felony to a misdemeanor. In June [2020], Somerville, Massachusetts, passed an ordinance allowing groups of three or more people who 'consider themselves to be a family' to be recognized as domestic partners….[T]he neighboring town of Cambridge followed suit, passing a broader ordinance recognizing multi-partner relationships. The law has proceeded even more rapidly in recognizing that it is possible for a child to have more than two legal parents. In 2017, the Uniform Law Commission, an association that enables states to harmonize their laws, drafted a new Uniform Parentage Act, one provision of which facilitates multiple-parent recognition. Versions of the provision have passed in California, Washington, Maine, Vermont, and Delaware, and it is under consideration in several other states. Courts in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Texas, Arizona, and Louisiana have also supported the idea of third parents. American conservatism has long mourned the proliferation of single parents, but, if two parents are better than one, why are three parents worse?\" { The New Yorker magazine, March 22, 2021 issue, How Polyamorists and Polygamists Are Challenging Family Norms. See also Polyamory and the Law, Harvard Law Today, August 3, 2021, available at https://hls.harvard.edu/today/polyamory-and-the-law/.}</p>\n<p>This begs the question: Should a person who would not meet the requirements for succession to a rent stabilized apartment after Braschi was decided in 1989, now, 33 years later, be evicted when they may qualify, as was the concluded in Braschi, under a more inclusive interpretation of a family?</p>\n<p>As stated by the Hon. Jenny Rivera in Green v Esplanade Venture Parthership (N.Y. 2021) [arguing that a person should be able to \"recover for the emotional distress caused by perceiving the serious injury or death of any person with whom they shared a strong personal and loving bond,\" and not just as to a family member -EV], \"Scores of cases decided before and after Braschi prove that New York courts are well-equipped to apply a functional mode of analysis in order to identify strong and caring bonds, when the important remedial purposes of New York law so require.\" Citing to Zimmerman v Burton (N.Y. Civ. Ct. 1980), Judge Rivera notes that \"[t]he law must keep abreast of changing moral standards\" as the Zimmerman court did in recognizing the tenant succession rights of unmarried partners.</p>\n<p>In sum, the problem with Braschi and Obergefell is that they recognize only two-person relationships. Those decisions, while revolutionary, still adhered to the majoritarian, societal view that only two people can have a family-like relationship; that only people who are \"committed\" in a way defined by certain traditional factors qualify for protection from \"one of the harshest decrees known to the law—eviction from one's home.\"</p>\n<p>Those decisions, however, open the door for consideration of other relational constructs; and, perhaps, the time has arrived. As Justice John Roberts foretold in his Obergefell dissent:</p>\n<p>\"Although the majority randomly inserts the adjective 'two' in various places, it offers no reason at all why the two-person element of the core definition of marriage may be preserved while the man-woman element may not.</p>\n<p>It is striking how much of the majority's reasoning would apply with equal force to the claim of a fundamental right to plural marriage…. If not having the opportunity to marry serves to disrespect and subordinate gay and lesbian couples, why wouldn't the same imposition of this disability … serve to disrespect and subordinate people who find fulfillment in polyamorous relationships (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)?\" …</p>\n<p>Here, Mr. Anderson, Mr. Romano, and Mr. O'Neill had a relationship to one another. There was knowledge of all persons about the others and, at least, passive consent, even if they did not all like each other. Was the relationship a \"good\" one? Mr. Romano describes Mr. O'Neill as \"intimidat[ing],\" and Mr. O'Neill describes Mr. Romano as \"abusive.\" It seems equally as unimportant as considering sexual relations to delve into the level of happiness in a relationship. Is one stripped of their rights to \"marital property\" on the basis of having a \"bad\" marriage? Would noneviction protections not devolve to an emotionally abusive spouse?</p>\n<p>Both [O'Neill] and Mr. Romano profess to have loved and cared for Mr. Anderson deeply. Read together, their affidavits imply that Mr. Anderson loved both of them in different ways. The relationship between Mr. O'Neill cannot be dismissed based on the allegations that he did not always contribute to household expenses, or \"did not pay his fair share of the rent or household expenses.\" This may, in fact, indicate a desire on Mr. Anderson's part to provide for Mr. O'Neill. Had Mr. Romano and Mr. Anderson chosen to live together, Mr. Anderson would very likely enjoy noneviction protections. However, they chose to live apart, and [O'Neill] was the one \"at home.\" The existence of a triad should not automatically dismiss [O'Neill]'s claim to noneviction protections. If [O'Neill] could potentially qualify in his own right, it should not be a dispositive factor that another person who does not live in the subject could also qualify if only they lived in the apartment….</p>\n<p>The court recognizes the difficulty and potential implications of not interpreting the Braschi court's interpretation of the word \"family\" as drawing a bright line which must end at what is now considered a traditional dyadic relationship. (The internet is rife with articles bemoaning the estate planning and child custody complications that arise from these new relational constructs.) But, \"[w]e just do not know the answers or implications for an exponential number of varied fact situations, so we should do what courts are in the business of doing—deciding cases as best they fallibly can.\" Accordingly, the court declines to award either party summary judgment….</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I should note that in Same-Sex Marriage and Slippery Slopes (2005), I argued that slippage from recognizing same-sex relationships to recognizing polyamorous relationships was unlikely, and I still tentatively think so; and this particular decision is, after all, the decision of just one judge at a relatively low-level court, who is expressly criticizing in part the decisions of the New York high court and the U.S. Supreme Court. Still, I thought the opinion was worth noting.</p>\n<p>Here's the summary of the parties' factual arguments:</p>\n<p>[The apartment building company] argues that \"[O'Neill and Scott Anderson] never comingled their finances or jointly owned real or personal property, held themselves out as a family unit, executed documents formalizing legal obligations, jointly celebrated most major holidays, or attended important events with each other's families.\" [The company] further states that the deceased tenant of record had a life partner of 25 years and that [O'Neill] is nothing more than a roommate. This statement is supported by the affidavit of Robert Romano …, who avers that he \"loved Scott Anderson.\" They were \"life partners\" who met 25 years ago, and that \"[d]uring the 25 years that [we] shared together, we held ourselves out as a couple, an exclusive couple As support for this, Romano avers that he and the deceased \"traveled frequently together, never with Mr. O'Neill.\" They \"considered each other family and incorporated one another into each other's immediate family.\" Mr. Romano and Mr. Anderson shared cell phone accounts and credit card accounts. Mr. Anderson was the beneficiary of his retirement fund, and he was the beneficiary of Mr. Anderson's retirement fund. \"[We] shared good times and bad times together. During his last few years of life, as he battled liver cirrhosis, I was his caretaker.\" Mr. Romano attaches photographs with a summary sheet detailing \"who, what, where, and when the photos were taken.\" Mr. Romano also attaches a Verizon bill demonstrating a joint account, a bill from a joint TD Bank account, and credit cards under the same account issued to both the deceased and Mr. Romano. They \"formed a life together, yet kept [their] own apartments in order to provide [them] comfort and space.\" Mr. Romano knew about [O'Neill], but they were not friends. \"We all grieve the loss of Scott.\" …</p>\n<p>He also recounts his relationship with the deceased. [O'Neill] states that he met Mr. Anderson in 2011. They \"hit it off immediately.\" \"After hanging out together\" and sharing various activities, they \"became more than friends and more than close despite [Mr. Anderson] being in another relationship.\" When [O'Neill] was searching for a new apartment, Mr. Anderson \"immediately offered [him] a room in the subject premises, a one-bedroom apartment, provided that I agreed to keep [their] relationship quiet and discreet.\" [O'Neill] avers that he \"moved in in 2012.\" [O'Neill] \"know[s] all about Robert Romano and his relationship with Scott, and [he] know[s] [Mr. Romano] does not like me.\" [O'Neill] states that Mr. Anderson spent \"substantially more time\" with him than with Mr. Romano.\" He describes a trip they took together to Boston for [O'Neill]'s birthday, where they shared the cost of the train and Spamalot tickets. Mr. Anderson surprised him with two Spamalot goblets \"which [he] still cherishes and [has] to this day.\" [O'Neill] states he was never invited to visit Mr. Anderson's family in Maine where Mr. Anderson traveled several times a year. He would miss Mr. Anderson whenever he was absent, the \"late night cocktails and banter, or watching old movies together, or sometimes just falling asleep holding each other then getting up and making breakfast since I love to cook and he loved my cooking.\" On one of those trips, Mr. Anderson brought [O'Neill] a candle which he keeps on his nightstand \"to keep his memory and ours alive and loved.\" [O'Neill] states that when Mr. Anderson had problems with Mr. Romano, Mr. Anderson would cry on his shoulder, grateful for his love and support, and said that \"someday [they would] be able to make [their] relationship official.\" [O'Neill] states that he provided a \"loving, understanding, and forgiving heart to come home to.\" \"When [[O'Neill]] contributed to the household expenses,\" including rent, he would make those contributions to Mr. Anderson in cash from his tips as a bartender. He often made deposits into what he later discovered to be a joint bank account that Mr. Anderson held with Mr. Romano. Often, he simply gave Mr. Anderson \"walking around money\" when he asked for it.

Mahsa Amini died after being detained by Iran’s morality police for allegedly breaking headscarf rules. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman was pronounced dead after three days in a coma, prompting thousands of people to flock to the streets of major cities including Tehran in protest. Large demonstrations spread in the following days to most of the country, with women waving and burning their hijabs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police have carried out sweeping arrests of hundreds of protesters and opened fire on crowds in Tehran, according to media reports. Amnesty International warned on Friday of the risk of further bloodshed and denounced the brutality of authorities.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. announced on Friday it will ease internet curbs on Iran after an internet blackout continued to disrupt or block Iranians’ ability to communicate on platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp. </p>",

        "description": "<p>When I launched Broadcom in the early 1990s with the goal of revolutionizing digital connectivity, it was necessary to work closely with governments around the world, starting with cable set-top boxes. This new class of technology that Broadcom and others brought to market over the next 30 years were transformative and complex, presenting policymakers with a steep learning curve that, at times, led to delays in or barriers to innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, some argued that governments can best help technological innovation by getting out of the way, but innovators such as Broadcom know it’s far better when policymakers and regulators keep pace with innovation and help make new life-enhancing technologies possible. When policymakers and innovators collaborate, they can unleash the future of the tech industry, bolster the broader economy, and improve the lives of billions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve seen first-hand how public-private collaboration has accelerated connectivity innovation, and there are compelling opportunities to continue this joint approach that has served the public so well. A great example of this from Broadcom’s early years took place when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) set aside wireless spectrum for unlicensed use. This spectrum became an innovation sandbox for Broadcom, turning Bluetooth and Wi-Fi into two of the most successful wireless technologies of all time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decades later, in April 2020, the FCC made another important policy decision for connectivity when it voted to allocate 1,200 MHz of spectrum in the 6 GHz band for unlicensed use, tapping a crucial spectrum band for making new, faster services publicly available. This groundbreaking act was the culmination of several years of public-private collaboration, with great leadership from then-FCC Chair Ajit Pai and Commissioners Jessica Rosenworcel, Brendan Carr, and Geoffrey Starks, along with bipartisan congressional advocacy spearheaded by Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact of the FCC’s decision dramatically demonstrated the important role Wi-Fi plays in American society. Almost immediately, hundreds of new devices and services entered the U.S. market, including new internet gateways, smartphones, and laptops. Whether in urban or rural areas, Wi-Fi is essential to closing the digital divide, and proved to be one of the global economy’s virtual connective tissues during the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is just the beginning. After shipping more than 1.3 billion Wi-Fi 6 and 6E chips over a two-year period, Broadcom was recently first to release a family of next generation Wi-Fi 7 chipsets, and thanks to advancements brought by unlicensed spectrum, improvements in health care, education, live entertainment, among others, are just around the corner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How much the U.S. economy will benefit from the FCC’s April 2020 decision will partly depend on a more recent milestone of Washington action that kept pace with tech innovation: new bipartisan investments in broadband infrastructure. In addition, as part of the recently enacted CHIPS and Science Act, Congress directed the Government Accountability Office to recommend ways the government can accelerate migration to leading edge technology, starting with broadband. Expediting this migration would allow us to better connect the unconnected and accelerate the introduction of new 5G services. This will ensure America continues to lead the world in advanced technology while achieving greater energy efficiency and climate goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is one constant in the tech industry, it’s that innovation never stops and momentum drives progress. In implementing initiatives on unlicensed spectrum and broadband infrastructure, U.S. policymakers stayed abreast of technological change and unleashed innovation. And there are several ways the public and private sectors can build on those successes. First, the U.S. government can advocate for making unlicensed 6 GHz spectrum available on a global scale. Second, as part of her efforts to close the digital divide through equitable access, FCC Chair Rosenworcel is seeking to deploy Wi-Fi on school buses — a brilliant and timely initiative to help students keep pace with their classroom work. She and her FCC colleagues are also in a position to build on the historic April 2020 decision by completing a current rule designed to enable portable device operations for applications such as augmented and virtual reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, policymakers seeking to look beyond the policy and technology horizon should consider expanding unlicensed spectrum availability into the 7 GHz band. Doing so would create yet another  innovation sandbox for next generation Wi-Fi and other forms of connectivity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During my tenure at Broadcom, including now as its Board Chair, I have been both participant and witness to a generation of the most transformative innovations in our history. The most rewarding of those breakthroughs came alongside or in response to collaborations with policymakers, creating economic opportunity, educational accessibility, and societal equity for billions all over the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best is yet to come, which is why it has never been more important for policymakers and innovators like Broadcom to deepen their partnerships and work in lockstep to futureproof our means for connectivity and close the digital divide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Henry Samueli is founder and chairman at Broadcom.</p>",

Let’s explore. — Anna</p>\nWhat does it mean?\n<p>Nubank is one of Latin America’s preeminent neobanks, so when its parent company, Nu Holdings, decided to go public with a dual listing in New York and São Paulo, the operation was one of the most anticipated exits of 2021 among observers of Brazil and fintech.</p>\n\n<p>The Nubank EC-1</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There have been some bumps on Nubank’s road to IPO — for instance, when it repriced its shares from $11 to $9 ahead of its exit. But the fact that its debut on December 9 went okay and that its market cap, while down, hasn’t plummeted either, could be considered a relative success.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to last week, when surprising news emerged: “Nubank to Delist from Brazil’s B3 Stock Exchange,” a Bloomberg Línea headline read. There’s more nuance to it: As the article detailed, the fintech company will actually “restructure its Brazilian Depositary Receipts (BDRs) program with the conversion from Level III to I.” Confused? You are not alone.</p>\n<p></p><p>For Brazilian shareholders, Nubank’s IPO has a bitter aftertaste by Anna Heim originally published on TechCrunch</p>",

        "description": "<p>The author on his latest ‘whole-life’ novel, the brutal realities of modern publishing and the inspirational influence of Catch-22</p><p>William Boyd, 70, is the author of 26 books, including Any Human Heart (2002) – adapted for television in 2010 with three actors playing the lead role of Logan Mountstuart – and Restless, the Costa novel of the year in 2006. His new book, The Romantic, is set in the 19th century and presents itself as a biographical fiction inspired by the personal papers of one Cashel Greville Ross, a Scots-born Irishman who fought at Waterloo, met Shelley, smuggled Greek antiquities and set out in search of the source of the Nile, among other adventures. Boyd, whom Sebastian Faulks has called “the finest storyteller of his generation”, grew up in Ghana and Nigeria and lives in London and the Dordogne, from where he spoke over Zoom.</p><p>Where did this novel begin?<br />My mid-20s were steeped in Romantic poetry because I spent eight years at Oxford not finishing a PhD on Shelley. I’ve always felt that nothing is wasted, and I was asking myself how I could recycle this material when I read The Life of Henry Brulard, the fantastically modern-feeling autobiography by [the 19th-century French writer] Stendhal, who I don’t think is much read in UK literary circles. He called himself a romantic because he kept falling in love – he felt it was a curse – and I decided that this store of knowledge I had about Romantic poets could gel with writing about someone with that kind of temperament.<br /><br />How does writing a “whole life” novel – this is your fourth – compare with writing your thrillers?<br />It’s more challenging. In a tightly structured spy novel like Restless, the plot machinery is part of the allure. Here, the narrative has to seem like it’s happening randomly, like life, yet it can’t flag: Cashel is 82 when he dies, and you can’t write a 5,000-page novel with every month and every year. My other three whole-life novels are told in the first person, so nothing can happen and it’s still interesting because of the voice. I was conscious that writing The Romantic in the third person meant that things had to keep happening, even at the end of Cashel’s life. What I came to understand was that 19th-century lives were incredibly crowded; Anthony Trollope went to Australia twice and America six times.<br /></p> Continue reading...",

Those words are apocryphally attributed to the Bolshevik revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, referring to the rapid collapse of tsarist Russia just over 100 years ago. If he had actually said those words, Lenin might have added that there are also decades when centuries happen.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The world is in the midst of one such decade. As with other historical hinges, the danger today stems from a sharp decline in world order. But more than at any other recent moment, that decline threatens to become especially steep, owing to a confluence of old and new threats that have begun to intersect at a moment the United States is ill positioned to contend with them.”</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Michael Urakami/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The Yankees can lock up a series win with a Saturday matinee.</p> <p>This series has been closer than I think we’d all like for a first-place team taking on a last-place team, but after back-to-back 5-4 wins over the Red Sox, the Yankees can lock down a series win in this four-game set today. The Sox have clearly taken these games seriously as they attempt to play postseason spoiler, so expect more of that today.</p>\n<p>Domingo Germán gets the ball, looking to continue his solid run of pitching. He’s made nine starts since August 1st, with a 2.34 ERA that will play in any rotation. His FIP over that span is more than a full run higher, but he’s done a good job of controlling contact quality, somewhat mitigating the risks of putting as many men on for free as he does. Germán’s only other start against Boston came at Fenway on August 12th, when he worked six innings of one-run ball, and we’d certainly take that again today.</p>\n<p>Nick Pivetta has battled consistency all year, seeing his strikeout rate decline and walk rate increase over last year, but without the repeatable ability to manage contact that Germán has shown. The two pitchers are actually fairly similar in their approach, with contact quality being the biggest difference in their seasons so far. Pivetta’s 4.35 ERA and 4.21 FIP present a good opportunity for the Yankees to get out ahead early.</p>\n<p>I get the feeling that Aaron Judge is feeling some of the pressure inherent with a 60 home run season, so we’ll just say that we hope he hits 61 today but if he doesn’t, we all still love him.</p>\n<p>How to watch</p>\n<p>Location: Yankee Stadium — Bronx, NY</p>\n<p>First pitch: 1:05 pm ET</p>\n<p>TV broadcast: YES, NESN</p>\n<p>Radio broadcast: WFAN 660/101.9, WADO 1380</p>\n<p>Online stream: MLB.tv</p>\n<p>For updates, follow us on Twitter and Instagram, and like us on Facebook.</p>\n\n\n<p>Saturday starters: pic.twitter.com/mck1mZ8mq8</p>— Red Sox (@RedSox) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Saturday Matinee. #RepBX <br /><br />Presented by @Hilton pic.twitter.com/CBlTa0DoxI</p>— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 24, 2022",

        "description": "The convoluted White Sox roster isn’t José Abreu’s problem. He needs to be back in Chicago. | Nick Cammett/Diamond Images via Getty Images\n    \n\n\n  <p>How better management can improve the White Sox defense — without losing their most productive hitter</p> <p>The White Sox are between many rocks and many hard places.</p>\n<p>The team’s best, most beloved player of the last decade — and the latest in the franchise’s storied history of borderline Hall of Fame first basemen — is a free agent. There might not be room to bring him back.</p>\n<p>I’m the last person to make excuses for this front office, and I’m rarely one to throw up my hands and stop advocating for a $230 million payroll with the knowledge that Jerry Reinsdorf can afford it, particularly after what might be the franchise’s most disastrous season of the century.</p>\n<p>In this case, though? There may be no better option than running it back. </p>\n<p>It might not be as difficult — or as much of a terrible fit — as the 2022 season would have us believe.</p>\n  \n        \n      David Richard-USA TODAY Sports\n  \n<p>A consensus appears to be building in relation to the defensive woes prompting this logjam: There’s simply not room on the roster for all three of José Abreu, Eloy Jiménez, and Andrew Vaughn. Not without continuing to hinder team defense to a critical degree, at least.</p>\n<p>It’s worth asking how true that really is.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to understand why this is a hot topic as we head into the early offseason far earlier than anticipated. Of all the ways that the 2022 White Sox were brutally unwatchable, the Little League-esque outfield defense might sit at the top of the list. Losing one of the slow-footed first basemen that GM Rick Hahn has spent the last five years collecting like Beanie Babies is the simplest way to improve that element heading into 2023. </p>\n<p>Nonetheless, you’ll be hard-pressed to convince me that the 2023 White Sox will be a better team without José Abreu. </p>\n  \n        \n      Brian Sevald-USA TODAY Sports\n  \n<p>The primary argument against returning all three players is that playing either Jiménez or Vaughn in the outfield essentially neutralizes their offensive value. There’s no better example than Vaughn of how ham-handed roster construction can turn what should be a good player into a net negative. It takes a lot of bad defensive play to turn a batter who’s hitting 25% better than league average (124 wRC+) into a replacement-level player, but that’s the unenviable position that the White Sox have forced onto the final top pick of their rebuild: Vaughn is two weeks away from joining Carlos Santana (2011) as the only modern players ever to fail to break even 0.4 fWAR despite hitting at such a level.</p>\n<p>Jiménez’s defensive woes shouldn’t need an explanatory paragraph. Anyone who’s watched since 2019 is plenty familiar with the injuries, brutal metrics, and ongoing ceding-of-outfield-ground to Luis Robert that resonated as perhaps a little bit less playful than the team’s bobblehead giveaway would have us believe. After watching Vaughn’s breakout offensive season be effectively erased by being forced into an unfamiliar defensive position, it’s logical to come to the conclusion that there are simply two spots for three players.</p>\n<p>I’d like to challenge that assessment. The error being made in these discussions — in my view — is equating Vaughn’s generationally dreadful glove with Jiménez’s simply bad one. </p>\n  \n        \n      Brian Sevald-USA TODAY Sports\n  \n<p>It’s an unquestionable fact that a legitimately contending team can’t play a fielder like Vaughn on even a semi-regular basis. However, that’s not necessarily the case with Jiménez. </p>\n<p>It’s true that he was one of the worst outfielders in the game in 2019 by almost any measure, and the manner by which he missed the first four months of the 2021 season did no favors to perceptions of his defense. Since that awful 2019 showing, the numbers still show a poor fielder — but not such a poor fielder that touching the grass will cancel out what he does in the batter’s box. Jiménez has played just less than 1,000 innings in the field since the start of the 2020 season, and on a per-inning basis, his Defensive Runs Saved rank 94th out of 119 players with at least that many outfield innings. By Statcast’s Outs Above Average (generally considered to be the most reliable fielding stat currently available), he ranks 99th.</p>\n<p>That’s bad, to be sure. Looking at some of the names near or below him on that leaderboard, however, tells us that it’s not so bad as to make a full-time move to DH an absolute necessity. The Phillies are in a playoff position with Kyle Schwarber and Nick Castellanos in their corners, making for perhaps the only outfield arrangement more unwatchable than the one on the South Side. Joc Pederson has been a White Sox target for multiple presidential administrations, and there were plenty of Sox fans last winter who were more than ready to stick Kris Bryant in the outfield, defense be damned. Multiple recent pennant winners have done so in spite of deploying virtual statues in left field.</p>\n<p>It’s not an ideal arrangement, but keeping Jiménez in the field at least part-time while re-signing Abreu and finally relieving Vaughn of glove-based duties may be the most feasible route to a 2023 bounce-back for this moribund offense while concretely upgrading their defensive standing. </p>\n  \n        \n      Kamil Krzaczynski-USA TODAY Sports\n  \n<p>The key word in that clause is feasible. If this were MVP Baseball 2005, the front office would thank Abreu for his service and spend that money on Brandon Nimmo or Trea Turner. Or perhaps they’d re-sign Abreu and trade Vaughn or Jiménez for equivalent pitching or infield talent. </p>\n<p>The reality, unfortunately, is a Reinsdorf team is not going to spend near the top of the weakest free agent class in years, and finding a fair match in a trade for either young player is considerably easier said than done, particularly given Hahn’s less-than-stellar trade history. The moves that would be necessary to replace a bat of Abreu, Jiménez, or Vaughn’s caliber have almost no chance of being made under the current regime. </p>\n<p>As much as it pains me to say it, the most reasonable route lies internally. Minor league fielding numbers for Oscar Colás are scant and middling, but scouting reports generally peg his glove as average to slightly above-average alongside an excellent arm. The addition of Colás to a healthy Luis Robert (and boy has he not been healthy this year) should deliver a significant recovery from this season’s worst-in-the-AL outfield defense — even with Jiménez remaining in the fold. </p>\n<p>His presence didn’t stop Sox outfielders from ranking in the top five by most measures during the shortened 2020 season. It’s reasonable to believe he won’t completely hamstring their defensive effort in 2023 as Vaughn has in 2022, if they make the right supplementary additions. More importantly, the sad fact is that an addition in the mold of a Kevin Kiermaier or Michael A. Taylor, or perhaps Adam Duvall — spare outfielders with plus gloves who can actually hit, with all due respect to Adam Engel — is an exponentially more realistic option than spending the money to adequately replace Jiménez, Vaughn, or Abreu.</p>\n<p>Put it another way: if the money that it takes to retain Abreu isn’t spent on Abreu, is anybody under the impression that it’ll be given to a player who can deliver a similar impact in the lineup, much less in the locker room?</p>\n  \n        \n      Kamil Krzaczynski-USA TODAY Sports\n  \n<p>To a degree, we already went through this with Carlos Rodón last winter. Why, many asked, do we need to keep Rodón when Michael Kopech is ready to step into his rotation spot? The answer now, as it was then, is simple: The White Sox do not have the developmental chops of the Astros, Dodgers, Yankees, or other teams that routinely replace departed stars from within. If Sox management thinks they need to let a player go because they already have too much talent at the position, history shows they’re almost certainly wrong — point blank.</p>\n<p>The elephant in the room that you’ve been waiting for me to mention is health. It may very well be that Jiménez is incapable of playing more than perhaps 80 to 100 games in the field without health issues.</p>\n<p>Here’s the crux of this article: If you’ve paid attention to the last few years — and acknowledge the general nature of a 162 game baseball season — there’s little reason to believe there won’t be enough space at DH to accommodate Jiménez’s injury history.</p>\n  \n        \n      Brian Sevald-USA TODAY Sports\n  \n<p>Consider this: If Vaughn remains in the lineup for the next two weeks, it’ll be the first time either he or Jiménez surpasses 130 games played in a season. They’ve combined for seven injured list stints in their brief careers, and they’ve been prohibited from playing more than a few times a week for a not-insignificant chunk of the time they’ve spent not on the IL. If you think there won’t be enough at-bats at DH to go around among the three sluggers in 2023, you’re probably incorrect, just as those who projected that Rodón’s innings wouldn’t be necessary in 2022 were far, far off.</p>\n<p>And if I’m the one who turns out to be wrong, and we get a full 150 games of availability from the trio? No complaints here.</p>\n<p>There’s also the question of making space for Yasmani Grandal when he isn’t catching. But after posting a sub-replacement level 2022 season, there’s no reason to allocate space for Grandal when he’s unable to sit behind the plate. This free agent market is saturated with affordable, platoon-friendly catchers who know how to swing the bat. If Grandal returns to previous levels of production, then the Sox have an excellent problem on their hands. But at age 34 and with 8,000 innings behind the plate on Grandal’s knees, it would be a mistake to bank on it.</p>\n  \n        \n      David Richard-USA TODAY Sports\n  \n<p>Let’s imagine the state of affairs if Abreu does leave and the money isn’t spent on an equally impactful hitter — the most likely outcome, if we’re being frank. Assuming he picks up his no-brainer option, AJ Pollock would handle full-time left field duties while Vaughn heads to first and Jiménez to DH as Colás presumably inherits right field. What happens in the event that Pollock, who has now failed to break 1 WAR in three of four seasons, doesn’t rebound? Pollock missed at least 45 games in five of six seasons prior to 2022, including the bulk of several of those years. If he, Colás, or Robert were to miss any time — and it would be incredibly foolish to plan on them not doing so — the team is stuck with one of two options: Roll with a viable fourth outfielder and possibly sacrifice a large chunk offensive production, or return Jiménez to left field, which only leaves them in same spot as before but with Jake Burger or Gavin Sheets in the space where Abreu used to be.</p>\n<p>If you believe that Vaughn will play 150 games at first base while Jiménez remains healthy all season on top of Pollock doing the same and finding his offensive groove again at age 36, then sure, let Abreu go somewhere else. I’m comfortable in predicting that’s not going to happen. </p>\n<p>As miserable as it’s been to watch the outfield, DH, and first base juggling act among those four, the way to solve that issue isn’t by letting by far the most reliably healthy and productive of those hitters go somewhere else. Rather than repeat the mistakes of last offseason, the priority should simply be to retain the All-Star talent they have in their lap. The rest can be figured out later. </p>",

        "description": "<p>No one can predict how a revolution starts. Nor can anyone know when one injustice will be what causes a people’s fury to overcome their fear. In 2011, in Tunisia, a street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, sparked an uprising by setting himself on fire. In 2022, in Iran, the death in police custody of a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, has brought Iranians onto the streets in every corner of the country.</p><p>Amini and her brother had traveled from Saqqez, a city in Iran’s Kurdistan Province, to visit relatives in the capital, Tehran, when, on September 13, the so-called morality police arrested her for improperly wearing her hijab, or headscarf. Three days later, she was declared dead. The authorities claim she died of cardiac arrest. According to a U.K.-based independent Iranian news site, the CT scans of her skull showed signs of fractures.      </p><p>Each time I see the images of her lying in a coma in a hospital bed, I cannot help thinking that I could have been Mahsa Amini. I was a girl in Iran in 1981, when a law making the hijab a mandatory dress code for women first came into force, two years after the Islamic Revolution. And I was a teenager when the morality police began making the rounds, stopping and arresting people on a whim, sometimes on no more pretext than a few strands of hair peeking out from under one’s scarf.</p><p>One August day in 1984, thickly wrapped under my Islamic uniform and headscarf when the temperature was intolerably high and the water fountains in Tehran had been shut off in observance of Ramadan, I began thinking that I would not mind dying if those who had made our lives so miserable were to die along with me. I left Iran later that year, but today I feel what so many Iranian women feel: We are all Mahsa Amini.</p><p>Since her death, thousands have taken to the streets in a show of rage and solidarity that is rare even for a country that has known many such tumultuous moments. More than some past uprisings against the regime, this one has been remarkably broad-based and inclusive. The affluent residents of north Tehran have come out alongside the poor ones from the city’s south side. The youth are there—and so are their parents, even their grandparents. The metropolitan people are out, and so are the small-town folk.</p><p>The women of Iran are at the forefront—they who have most consistently resisted the regime’s tyranny and persisted in rebutting the myth that the hijab is an Iranian tradition. The sight of all the men at their side is a sign of the near-universal disdain for the regime’s official misogyny. With the risks these citizens are taking and the sacrifices they are making, they are proving that if any tradition needs defending 24 hours a day by armed men who have to beat people to embrace it, then it deserves to perish.</p><p>Even the celebrities who kept silent in the past are speaking up. Movie stars and sports figures are tweeting messages of support for the demonstrators—some even calling on the army to intervene on the people’s behalf. The popular musician Homayoun Shajarian, the son of a beloved master of Persian music, Mohammad-Reza Shajarian, projected an outsized image of Mahsa Amini as the backdrop to his latest concert—an act of defiance that prompted the audience to chant “Death to Khamenei” (Iran’s supreme leader).</p><p>[From the July/August 2006 issue: The Persian version]</p><p>All talk of ethnic or other divisions that once pitted one group against another in Iran is forgotten. For years, rumors about the threat of separatist movements, especially in Iranian Kurdistan, caused bitter debate. But the nationwide grief over the death of this young Kurdish woman, whose loss has been lamented in such unlikely parts of the country as the Turkish-speaking city of Orumiyeh, has overridden the old tensions. In the face of the common injustice that every Iranian experiences, ethnic differences seem insignificant.  </p><p>No one in Iran today is setting fire to effigies of Uncle Sam or the U.S. flag. Instead, women are burning their headscarves in the street, on bonfires that men light for them. They don’t object to the hijab itself; they object to not having the right to choose whether to wear it. Somehow, despite the virtual absence of relations between Iran and the U.S. for more than four decades, those two vital American ideas—about rights and choice—have made their way into the country. People are marching through the streets not with the slogan “Death to America” but with a new one: “Death to the Dictator.” The people who once believed America was the Great Satan, the source of all evil, are now chanting “Our enemy is right here. They lie when they say it’s America.”</p><p>Forty-three years ago, Iran humiliated America before the world by parading in front of cameras the blindfolded U.S. embassy staff it had taken hostage in Tehran. Today, the Iranian people are humiliating their own leaders by defacing the murals of Ali Khamenei and tearing down his image from billboards.</p><p>These demonstrators are asking not for lower fuel prices, or better salaries, or fair elections—the demands of so many previous protests. In fact, they are not asking for anything at all. They simply want the regime to go.</p><p>Iranians’ aspirations for the rule of law date from long before the Islamic Revolution; they began more than a century ago with the country’s Constitutional Revolution. For nearly 20 years, the U.S. State Department has spent tens of millions of dollars to advance the cause of democracy in Iran. This investment is a pittance compared to the trillions America has spent pursuing wars in two of Iran’s neighboring countries, Iraq and Afghanistan, not to mention all of the blood spilled, yet American support for the dream of democracy has been vital—and may at last be yielding results.</p><p>[Graeme Wood: Iran’s knucklehead assassination strategy]</p><p>The question is whether Washington is ready for this moment. Have America’s sponsors of Iranian democracy planned for what to do if they succeed?</p><p>Iran has reached its Ukrainian moment, the time when a people realize that they are willing to pay the price for their freedom. Iranians recognize that this is their fight, and—unarmed as they are—they are on the streets facing the regime’s paramilitary thugs. In social-media posts, some of this movement’s prominent activists have recorded video statements saying that they refuse to leave the country—whatever the future may bring, they’re there to stay.</p><p>The United States, through actions and not simply messages of support, must show that it cares as much about the Iranian people’s aspirations for freedom as about containing the regime’s nuclear ambitions. One step the U.S. could take would be to suspend its participation in the talks to restore the nuclear deal. That would be a signal to the ayatollahs that they have no chance of seeing economic sanctions relaxed as long as their goons are shooting their own people on the streets of Iran.</p><p>Like the Ukrainians, Iranians cannot win their freedom without the support of the U.S. and other Western nations. They are willing to make sacrifices, but that willingness and determination alone cannot win revolutions. Americans have waited four decades for Iranians to reject the regime’s propaganda and stop seeing them as the enemy. This is a historic opportunity for the two nations to forge a new bond if the U.S. chooses to support Iranians in their hour of need. Those who wish to see democracy regain momentum around the world must do their part.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Netflix is adding Oxenfree, the popular supernatural mystery thriller game created by Night School Studio, to its gaming roster. Oxenfree: Netflix Edition is now available for Netflix subscribers to download on iOS and Android devices, the company announced at its Tudum global fan event on Saturday. The launch of the game comes a year after Netflix acquired Night School Studio.</p>\n<p>Oxenfree was originally launched in 2016 and was Night School’s debut title. The Netflix edition of the game includes no ads or in-app purchases, and also adds localization support.</p>\n<p>The game sees players take on the role of Alex, a rebellious teenager who brings her new stepbrother Jonas to an overnight party on Edwards Island, which is an abandoned military island. The night then takes a turn when the group of friends unintentionally open a ghostly rift spawned from the island’s cryptic past. Throughout the game, players choose every aspect of Alex’s story while exploring the island through dialogue choices.</p>\n<p>“Oxenfree is such a special game to so many people and launching on Netflix is a really exciting opportunity for us to introduce Alex’s story to even more people – maybe even someone who never thought they’d love playing a game,” said Sean Krankel, co-founder and studio director at Night School Studio, in a statement. “As a Netflix games studio, we have the best support to bring Oxenfree: Netflix Edition to a global audience. Our community has requested subtitles in additional languages for a long time and this release of Oxenfree: Netflix Edition truly delivers the best narrative experience for players worldwide in their local language. ”</p>\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: Netflix</p><p></p>\n<p>At launch, in-game subtitles are available in over 30 languages, including Arabic, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Spanish (Latam), Spanish (Spain), Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese.</p>\n<p>Although Netflix has released a handful of games on its streaming service over the past couple of months, the addition of Oxenfree: Netflix Edition marks its first in-house launch. The release could also be a way for Netflix to attract more people to its gaming service, which is likely a significant goal for the company, especially given that a recent report revealed that less than 1% of Netflix subscribers are interested in Netflix Games.</p>\n<p>Oxenfree: Netflix Edition is available to download on mobile devices at netflix.com/oxenfree. When playing games on Netflix, users on an iOS or Android mobile phone will see a dedicated games row where they can select any game to download. Subscribers on an Android or iOS tablet will see a dedicated games row or be able to select games from the categories drop-down menu to download and play.</p>\n<p>Netflix plans to have more than 50 games on its platform by the end of the year. The company launched its gaming service in November 2021 and has been adding new games to its catalog every month. The titles are currently free to play and don’t include any in-app purchases.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix acquires its first games studio, “Oxenfree” developer Night School</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Netflix’s edition of Night School’s ‘Oxenfree’ is now available to play on iOS and Android by Aisha Malik originally published on TechCrunch</p>",

        "description": "<p>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here.</p>\n<p>When On Deck had to cut its staff twice within a matter of months, its co-founders Erik Torenberg and David Booth published a memo promising to focus more. Thus marked the company’s reversal to its original customer cohort — founders in need of networks and advice.</p>\n<p>Since that day, I’ve been digging into what happened at On Deck that led to a string of layoffs and the refocusing. We know that producitizing community has its challenges. But what are those challenges and how do they manifest beyond employees losing their jobs.</p>\n<p>One month later, we have some answers. On Deck is spinning out half of its business, focused on career services, into a new startup slated to launch in October. Torenberg, the founder, is stepping back from his co-CEO position after only a year, returning to an executive chairman role. And the vision of an On Deck accelerator has wound down altogether, with the company just launching a fresh fund to invest in startups at market terms. I learned how a plucked Tiger Global term sheet was one of the first dominoes to fall, per sources, forcing the company to prioritize growth over runway.</p>\n<p>Even if you don’t care about the intricacies of this one startup, On Deck’s pivot and challenges offer a window into the complexities of building a business. Especially after last week’s Launch House news, I think it’s fascinating to see two examples of how startups trying to provide a network in exchange for equity and/or money hit growth pains at different points.</p>\n<p>In Launch House’s case, allegations underscored poor leadership. In On Deck’s case, product changes underscored a fragmenting focus. Both, while extremely different stories, have explained how selling something as vague and broad as “community” isn’t that simple to pull off. I’ve spoken a lot about how a community is more than a Slack group where people trade ideas; it’s living, breathing and requires more than just expression. That in and of itself is hard to force but add in the exponential growth needs of a venture-backed startup and the tradeoffs begin.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to get a founder to pay for a network without knowing exactly how that network will benefit the founder. How do you convince founders that your network is far more different than one that they find for free? How do you solve for buy-in or create a space that isn’t just transactional? And how do you ask people to wait for the long-game payoff instead of short-term wins?</p>\n<p>For the full story, read my feature: “On Deck tried to do it all. Now it’s trying to do less, better.” If you like this newsletter, do me a quick favor? Forward it to a friend, share it on Twitter, and tag me so I can thank you for reading it myself!</p>\nThe ideal runway is a myth\n<p>When it comes to advice, tech loves standardization. Startups are often told that there are certain metrics to hit, deadlines to meet and timetables to measure themselves against. But for TechCrunch+ this week, I dug into the idea that having an ideal runway as a startup is a myth.</p>\n<p>Here’s why it’s important: Numbers are nuanced. Sure, 20 years of runway could just mean that the startup is so nearly profitable that it has a limitless runway and that it is confident in its future. But it could also mean that the founder isn’t taking as many risks as they should. Some could argue that 20 years of runway is too much runway. I mean, spend a little, right?</p>\n\n<p>The ‘ideal runway’ is a myth, isn’t it?</p>\n<p></p>\n\nMore money doesn’t mean more growth, and other startup myths\nLooking at 320 pitch decks, here’s what science tells us works best\nSoftBank cuts internal valuation of $10 billion Oyo to $2.7 billion\n\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: Derek Croucher / Getty Images</p><p></p>\nThe Merge didn’t surge\n<p>Last week, Equity and Chain Reaction teamed up to talk about The Merge. It’s a perfect episode for people who, like me, didn’t know the intricacies of the event or really understand its impact or get why it sounded like a crypto-specific version of a lunar eclipse.</p>\n<p>Here’s why it’s important: Once you listen to the episode, TC’s crypto reporter Jacquelyn Melink has a follow up that simply hits different. She reports that Ethereum dropped more than 17% after what some described as a “way overhyped” Merge.</p>\n\nMiners flee to Ethereum Classic as ‘the Merge’ arrives\nEthereum switches to proof-of-stake consensus after completing The Merge\nLido, Coinbase, Kraken and Binance stake majority of ETH.

This week, we’re checking in with the latest and greatest in insurtech.</p>\n<p>Here’s what’s new: Our latest Equity episode gets into why the sector, somewhat dimmed by its public market comps, is still receiving millions from venture capitalists. As my work bestie Mary Ann Azevedo reports, the future of insurtech investing is focused on more niche cases. It’s good to see that specialization, at least in a startup’s early days, helps it stand out.</p>\n\nInsurtech gets more specialized, with products just for e-bikes and factory-built homes\nA Strava co-founder races into a lucrative market – lending against life insurance\nHow a pivot helped HopSkipDrive emerge successful in a sector where many failed \n\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: Getty Images</p><p></p>\nA few notes\n<p>We’re less than one month away from TechCrunch Disrupt, and I’m already emotional.

        "description": "<p>Welcome back to This Week in Apps, the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>\n<p>Global app spending reached $65 billion in the first half of 2022, up only slightly from the $64.4 billion during the same period in 2021, as hypergrowth fueled by the pandemic has slowed down. But overall, the app economy is continuing to grow, having produced a record number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the latest year-end reports. Global spending across iOS and Google Play last year was $133 billion, and consumers downloaded 143.6 billion apps.</p>\n<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and much more.</p>\n<p>Do you want This Week in Apps in your inbox every Saturday?

Last month, we looked at how one of the world’s largest social networks, Facebook, had begun to fade in relevance — and was losing its position in the App Store’s Top Charts, as a result — while young people turned to apps like BeReal and TikTok instead. But there still seems to be this sentiment among a number of app makers that trying to compete in social is a lost cause. That’s not necessarily true anymore. Just as Instagram grew under Facebook’s shadow, there’s room for other apps to grow outside TikTok — an app that is today seen as more of an entertainment platform than a place to connect with close friends (though TikTok is pushing to change that).</p>\n<p>BeReal’s rise is proof that alternative networks that prioritize real-world friendships can still find traction. In fact, younger people are hungry for a place to be themselves and keep up with their friends outside of feeds filled with creator content and targeted ads.</p>\n<p>But BeReal’s long-term success is not a given at this point, even though the app currently has established itself as a leader in the App Store’s Top Five, and is often the No. 1 app, at times, in global markets. That’s a good start, but BeReal has yet to figure out key parts of its business, like monetization, and is struggling to communicate both with its own users and the wider public.</p>\n<p>For instance, when the app went down this week, the company vaguely tweeted a statement — “yup, we’re on it” — that largely left its user base in the dark about what was going on. By comparison, when Instagram experienced a briefer, partial outage the following day, it spelled out that it understood the situation by noting that some people were “having trouble accessing Instagram,” and that it was working to fix things as quickly as possible and to stay tuned. It also added the #instagramdown hashtag to increase the visibility of its post.</p>\n<p>The company is behaving poorly for an app in its position. There are times to be cute and cheeky with social media posts — but those times are not amid outages and other serious platform issues. BeReal’s misstep with users will be forgiven for now. But as the company scales, the team’s inability to communicate with its own users and the media could become a larger problem.</p>\n<p>To date, BeReal has only offered off-the-record briefings with select press. It doesn’t have an in-house comms team. It doesn’t pitch or post to a blog to keep its users updated. It doesn’t even publish useful release notes on the App Store.</p>\n<p></p><p>App Store release notes — so helpful! Image Credits: BeReal</p><p></p>\n<p>And BeReal couldn’t respond to a series of simple questions about its outage — like what caused it or how widespread it was. This begs the question as to how the company will handle a more serious crisis — like a hack, data breach or another incident involving bad actors on its platform. It can get away with this for now — but not forever. Gaining the top spot on the App Store as Gen Z’s favorite social app also comes with responsibilities, and so far, BeReal has been dropping the ball on that front.</p>\n<p>Remember that this is no longer some scrappy app maker, paying college students to download its new toy. The company raised a $30 million Series A, led by Andreessen Horowitz and Accel, followed by a Series B from DST Global, valuing the startup, pre-money at $600+ million. It’s time for BeReal to grow up.</p>\n<p>BeReal’s missteps, however, could open the door to more social app newcomers who offer a service that’s built on more than a gimmick.</p>\n<p>For what it’s worth, TikTok has realized this market still has tons of unclaimed territory. Last weekend, it rolled out its shameless BeReal clone, TikTok Now, as a standalone app in global markets outside the U.S. The new app already found some traction, moving into the Top 100 social apps on iPhone in five markets, and the Top 500 in 38 within roughly a day’s time. A couple of days later, it ranked in the Top 10 social apps in 39 countries and the Top 100 in 24. And it presents almost nothing new to users beyond a TikTok-produced version of the BeReal format with added support for video. (And maybe less horrible-looking selfies?)</p>\n<p>If a complete knock-off like TikTok Now can climb the charts, imagine what a truly unique app could do. (Or even a newcomer that simply revives older social networking concepts for this modern era. Time to bring back Path?) There are few times when it would make sense to build a social app. But as the old guard is inching toward retirement, that time is surely now.</p>\nYouTube takes on TikTok with creator ad share for Shorts\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: YouTube</p><p></p>\n<p>YouTube has stopped messing around. It’s taking on the TikTok threat in a way that not only benefits its competitive position in the short-form video market, but one that allows it to expand its ad load across a new surface. This week, the company announced Shorts creators will now qualify for its revamped YouTube Partner Program, which allows them to earn ad revenue from YouTube.</p>\n<p>The existing Partner Program for long-form video requires YouTubers to have 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours. This won’t change. But starting in early 2023, creators will be able to apply to the program if they meet a new Shorts-specific threshold of 1,000 subscribers and 10 million Shorts views over 90 days. As members of the Partner Program, these creators will earn 45% of ad revenue from their videos. (Ads will run in-between Shorts and the money is pooled. Creators keep 45% of the revenue from the amount allocated to them, not to licensing. Some creators don’t think that’s a great deal, however.)</p>\n<p>The changes are designed to onboard creators gaining traction or going viral on Shorts, whether it’s with original content or clipping from other people’s videos (which is totally okay with YouTube).</p>\n<p>To further sweeten the pot, YouTube also introduced Creator Music — an online service where creators can choose music for their videos by examining the costs associated with licensing specific tunes or they can browse songs they can use without paying upfront. The latter opts them into a rev share with music rights holders.</p>\nSpotify gets into audiobooks\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: Spotify</p><p></p>\n<p>Spotify believes audiobooks could be its next big revenue driver, so on Tuesday, the company launched its debut audiobook catalog in the U.S. with somewhere north of 300,000 titles to start. Initially, the selections in the app will be recommended by Spotify editors. But over time, the company says it plans to expand audiobooks to other markets, grow its selection and begin to use algorithmic recommendations to suggest books to users, as it does now with its other audio formats.</p>\n<p>The company had earlier pointed to research indicating the audiobook industry is expected to grow from $3.3 billion as of 2020 to $15 billion by 2027. It forecast its audiobook sales could reach a gross margin of above 40%.</p>\n<p>The books are found in a new Audiobooks hub in the app and are purchased à la carte at variable pricing — a move Spotify believes will allow lesser-known authors to find an audience. And notably, they’re not being sold via in-app purchases.</p>\n<p>Instead, the app offers previews of the book’s content for free, but users will be directed to Spotify’s website to complete their purchases. Afterward, the purchased audiobook will be unlocked in the app and saved to the user’s library.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting Spotify’s ability to avoid in-app purchases on iOS follows a policy change Apple announced back in March which focused on “reader” apps — meaning those designed to provide access to digital content like music, books, videos or magazines. Apple said these apps could now use external links, if approved. Google, meanwhile, began piloting third-party billing earlier this year, with Spotify as its first customer.</p>\n<p>Spotify didn’t clarify its agreements with the app stores, but says its model is “compliant.”</p>\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: Spotify</p><p></p>\nMeta is sued for tracking users with a workaround to ATT\n<p>A new class action lawsuit claims Meta circumvented Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) privacy protections to track its users, even after those users denied the company permission to do so via the ATT prompt. The plaintiffs allege Meta had followed its users’ online activity by injecting JavaScript into the websites they visited when using Facebook’s in-app web browser. This was effectively a way to work around the protections ATT supposedly puts into place, the suit alleges. Meta has denied the claims, calling the lawsuit “without merit.”</p>\n<p>Users rightly believe that when they opt out of tracking on iOS, they simply won’t be tracked. But that’s not necessarily true. Companies had been looking for workarounds to ATT since it was announced, Meta included.</p>\n<p>This isn’t the first time an app has been suspected of using the browser to track users without their consent. This summer, TikTok was also accused of injecting code to track users’ keystrokes when users visited third-party websites from within the TikTok app. The company denied those claims as well, saying the app’s code was used for debugging, troubleshooting and performance monitoring, and for protecting users against spam and other threats.</p>\n<p>The case will likely be highly technical but will be an interesting one to follow as the extent of ATT’s ability to protect consumers is decided.</p>\nWeekly News\nPlatforms: Apple\n<p></p><p>Image Credits: Matthew Panzarino / TechCrunch</p><p></p>\n\nApple released the first major update to its iOS 16 operating system with fixes that address issues with the camera shaking in some third-party apps on iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max as well as the paste permissions bug which popped up a request to read the clipboard data too often, along with other issues.

General Assembly, stating that international efforts to interfere with Taiwan will be “crushed by the wheels of history.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Any scheme to interfere in China’s internal affairs is bound to meet the strong opposition of all Chinese and any move to obstruct China’s reunification is bound to be crushed by the wheels of history,” Wang said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The speech repeatedly emphasized China's claim to Taiwan, a self-governing island that separated from the mainland in 1949. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We must combat Taiwan independence separatist activities with the firmest resolve and take the most forceful steps to oppose external interference,” Wang continued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The speech follows a trip by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other American lawmakers to Taipei this summer as part of a tour around the Indo-Pacific region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The visit provoked Chinese leadership, who argued that the group’s time in Taipei violated the “One China policy,” under which the U.S. recognizes Beijing as the sole legal government of China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It gravely undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and sends a seriously wrong signal to the separatist forces for ‘Taiwan independence,’” said the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pelosi’s trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wang asserted in his address that China’s “sovereignty and territory integrity has never been severed” and that Taiwan has been a part of that territory “since ancient times.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The minister repeatedly expressed his government’s commitment to reunification with Taiwan following its split from the mainland after the Chinese Civil War.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Only when China is fully reunified can there be true peace across the Taiwan Strait,” Wang said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wang also addressed China’s oft-criticized human rights record, affirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on behalf of the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“China abides by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and has made relentless efforts to protect and strengthen its human rights,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The minister continued: “We stand firmly against attempts to politicize human rights and work to promote healthy development of international human rights cooperation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released a report earlier this month condemning China’s treatment of the Uyghur minority and saying the government may have committed “crimes against humanity” in the Xinjiang province.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chinese government called the OHCHR’s findings “groundless,” accusing the U.N. of interfering in China’s internal affairs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“People of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are living a happy life in peace and contentment,” wrote the government in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>— Updated at 2:42 p.m. </p>",

        "description": "<p>What drives economic growth and job creation, and decreases poverty? This is today’s dominant concern for senior policymakers in our cities, states, and, indeed, the entire country. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam Smith in “The Wealth of Nations” provided an answer much earlier in a related context: “Commerce and manufactures can seldom flourish long in any state which does not enjoy a regular administration of justice, in which the people do not feel themselves secure in the possession of their property.” More generally, human progress is a function of ideas, individuals and institutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Economic growth has three primary determinants: physical capital growth, human capital growth and technological innovation. If individuals are less confident their private property rights will be enforced, they are less likely to invest in physical capital (retail outlets, business facilities, manufacturing plants and equipment). If a city does not enforce respect for private property rights, expropriation can occur in the form of looting and the threat of armed violence against the owners of the physical capital. Businesses will respond by choosing not to operate in such cities; this will lead to the loss of jobs and diminished economic activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Human capital is more difficult to expropriate. The primary reason most individuals invest in human capital (education, trade apprenticeship, professional training) is it enhances their ability to generate income and create wealth. As property crime and violent crime in a city deteriorate, people living in such cities are motivated to leave and move to safer areas. People with higher education and professional training, aka knowledge workers, are more likely to have the economic resources and job opportunities to move to a safer city. In a mirror image of this phenomenon, companies that employ knowledge workers as human capital would be motivated to move from cities with deteriorating crime to safer cities. As these knowledge workers and companies depart cities with growing crime rates, this has a negative multiplier effect on job creation and economic growth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technological innovation, primarily driven by the intellectual and creative efforts of knowledge workers, is a key driver of economic growth. Hence, knowledge workers and companies departing cities due to crime compound the negative multiplier effect. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My colleagues and I constructed two proxies for the rule of law in 199 of the largest U.S. cities: the rate of violent crime per 100,000 people, and the rate of property crime per 100,000 people. Per data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, violent crime is composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Under the program, property crimes include the offenses of burglary, larceny/theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson. We obtained corresponding data on job growth rates and poverty rates from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Decennial Census and the American Community Surveys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 1 highlights that cities with higher current property crime rates experience lower job growth rates in the future. Besides the size of the economic pie, which is related to the job growth rate, senior policymakers and media across the country are increasingly concerned about how this pie is sliced in terms of poverty and income inequality. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 2 highlights that cities that have a higher current property crime rates experience higher poverty rates in the future. Conceptually, as law and order improves in a city, its citizens and businesses have greater confidence that they can enjoy the benefits of their investment in physical and human capital; that increased incentive to invest in physical and human capital leads to more jobs and income for the broader citizenry, resulting in less poverty.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In a more formal analysis, we found that the above results are statistically significant. Also, we found that cities that had higher current violent crime rates experienced lower job growth rates in the future, and cities that had higher current violent crime rates experienced higher poverty rates in the future. Once again, these relationships are statistically significant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of the above results are particularly surprising. In an earlier study, we did a comprehensive analysis of the empirical relationship between economic growth and the rule of law using panel regressions for 134 countries from the period 1984-2019. We documented a significant positive relationship between rule of law and GDP per capita. Also, we documented that countries with greater adherence to rule of law are characterized by less income inequality. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The above analysis leads to the following policy recommendation for political leaders in various cities and states around the country: Focus on ensuring respect for private property rights, effective police forces, prosecutors willing to enforce the rule of law, and fair courts. This will enhance the economic prosperity of your citizens and diminish poverty in your region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sanjai Bhagat is Provost Professor of Finance at the University of Colorado, and author of \"Financial Crisis, Corporate Governance, and Bank Capital,\" published by Cambridge University Press. </p>",

        "description": "<p>The reaction by Russian citizens to President Vladimir Putin’s announcement to call up 300,000 military reservists to fight in Ukraine has been nothing short of remarkable. Protests have erupted across the country and more than 1,300 people have been detained during anti-war demonstrations. An astonishing exodus of conscription-age men has commenced, with flights from Russia selling out at incredibly inflated prices, and miles-long lines of cars forming at multiple exit points along the borders. This follows Ukraine’s stunning successes in the east that saw Russian soldiers deserting their positions and equipment and left some in the Russian media to openly question the war for the first time. Clearly, the Kremlin’s claim to the concept of Russian patriotism are less than credible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At home and on the battlefield, prospects for this call-up are exceedingly suspect. For one, Russian reservists are only former service members who lack the repeated training and readiness that make American military reservists combat deployable within days of being recalled. Additionally, morale and unit cohesion within the ranks of the Russian army in Ukraine are abysmal. Successful integration of new conscripts who lack familiarity with the mission, members and identity of the units to which they will be assigned is certain to be an impossible endeavor.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrast this with America’s all-volunteer force that has been in place for the past five decades. If we only look at today, our total active force strength numbers over 1.3 million, and for nearly every year going back to the end of the draft, it has been higher. Taking one example, the total number of service members who deployed for the Gulf War and after 9/11 tops 5 million. Compared to Putin’s last-ditch demand for reservists, these numbers are almost too big to believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How has this happened?  Simply put, the all-volunteer force has made our military better than those of our adversaries. To recruit and retain such an organization, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) constantly self-evaluates, especially in areas such as mission effectiveness, quality of service, quality of life. Like their civilian counterparts, American service members desire to serve in successful units that value their contributions and offer reasonable incentives. By and large, our military has delivered this to them, and the result has been a global fighting force that has protected our people and partners around the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, troubling trends in American society are eroding the strength of this all-volunteer force. The pool of qualified personnel who have an interest in serving continues to decline from year to year. A perfect storm of physical and mental health decline, drug use and criminal misconduct has combined with the fact that fewer people in the general population have military experience to make the call of duty less appealing to America’s youth. Recent recruiting statistics reveal this all too well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has called for the White House and Congress to address these issues by proposing that they come together to establish a bipartisan commission of leaders, much like President Richard Nixon did in 1969 when he decided to end conscription. Rather than creating the all-volunteer force, the new panel’s mission would be to save it. Such a commission would be charged with eliminating misconceptions about military service, raising awareness of its many benefits and inspiring our youth with the support of key figures in popular culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite superior firepower and numbers, the Russian military’s failure in fighting Ukraine is largely due to the inferior quality, readiness and will of its service members. Putin’s recent draft will only make that worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and coast guardsmen answer the call with their own free will — and because of that, they are second-to-none. Let us use this moment to recognize that we cannot take that for granted and we must ensure America’s all-volunteer force has what it takes to last long into the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rear Admiral (ret.)

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/3658981-why-the-fed-is-pushing-unemployment-higher/",
        "description": "<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday it will be almost impossible for the central bank to beat inflation without hundreds of thousands of Americans losing their jobs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fed officials expect the unemployment rate to rise to 4.4 percent next year, up from 3.7 percent in August, as they jack up borrowing costs and slow the economy, according to projections released Wednesday.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts say such an increase in the jobless rate over the course of a year would likely push more than 1 million workers out of their current jobs and leave millions more unable to find better work or higher wages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We certainly haven't given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest increase in unemployment,” Powell said Wednesday after the Fed delivered another massive rate hike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Nonetheless, we need to complete this task,” he continued.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, the Fed knows its past and future rate hikes will lead to higher unemployment and won’t stop fighting inflation because of it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But higher unemployment isn't just a side effect of the Fed's plans: It's a goal.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Powell and scores of other economists believe the U.S. job market is too strong to allow inflation to fall. The combination of super-low unemployment and record-high job openings have fueled rapid wage growth, they contend, which forces businesses to raise prices to afford higher labor costs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Powell has argued for months that the Fed must bring the labor market into “balance” before inflation could fall back to normal levels. But that means putting people out of work and leaving them with much fewer opportunities to find jobs after nearly two years of rapid inflation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It's going to be extremely painful for those families who are going to be hit with a double whammy. Not only are prices continuing to go up, at this very high inflation rate, they might lose their jobs as well,” said Derek Tang, co-founder and economist at research firm Monetary Policy Analytics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fed is obligated under federal law to keep both unemployment and inflation as low as possible. To do so, the bank cuts interest rates to spur the economy when unemployment is high and raises rates to slow the economy when inflation starts to rise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After cutting rates to near-zero levels during the onset of the pandemic, the Fed waited too long to begin raising them as the economy recovered and inflation rose in 2021 — not unlike a driver keeping their foot on the accelerator as a car soars down a hill. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The question is, are we going to tap or slam on the brakes?” Preston Mui, economist at research nonprofit Employ America, wrote in a Friday email. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Driving the economy into a recession will likely relieve inflation, but it will do so at a tremendously high cost. Those unemployed are not only going to miss out on a job for a year; these workers will likely see depressed employment and incomes for a decade.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Powell and those who support the Fed’s rapid rate hikes say it's a necessary trade off to avert a far worse downturn. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fed failed for decades to quell inflation as it rose throughout the 1960s and '70s, leading to a spiral of ever-climbing prices and wages. The inflationary surge weighed heavily on the economy until the Fed under former Chairman Paul Volcker deliberately induced a recession with a shocking increase in interest rates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Powell has argued for months that a temporary downturn that helps bring inflation down for good is far better for the U.S. than allowing inflation to spiral out of control and lead to a deeper, more painful recession. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If we want to light the way to another period of a very strong labor market, we have got to get inflation behind us. I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn’t,” Powell said Wednesday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts say that pain will come first as a general decline in wage growth, with earnings likely falling further behind prices. Then companies will likely be forced to pull back open jobs before some eventually face the need to cut hours or staff as sales fall in a weaker economy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As the interest rate goes up, it gets more expensive for businesses to do business. So, therefore, I think everybody's worried that they’ll slow down hiring,” said Jane Oates, a former Labor Department official and president of WorkingNation, a research and advocacy nonprofit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oates added that the slowdown will also raise questions about the strength of holiday-season hiring, which is often the point of reentry for workers who have left the labor market. There were still roughly 1.6 million fewer Americans in the labor market in August than in February 2020, and a slower labor market may yield few opportunities for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critics of the Fed’s approach also believe the central bank is overestimating how much it must damage the labor market in order to bring inflation down.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mui, of Employ America, argued the Fed’s focus on the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers is misguided because job openings data “do not really reflect how job search actually happens.” He added that leaning on the Fed to suppress demand will also do little to quash the constraints on supply that are driving prices higher. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The bulk of the current inflation we are seeing are caused by supply issues in particular industries stemming from the pandemic,” he wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Fed's projections show that it is willing to accept over a million more unemployed over the next few years. I think that is a way too costly a path to commit to given the weakness of the evidence that it's necessary.” </p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3658507-the-seven-democrats-most-likely-to-run-for-president-if-biden-bows-out/",
        "description": "<p>President Biden’s statement this week that it “remains to be seen” if he'll run for reelection has prompted more Democratic chatter about whether they'll have a different candidate for the White House in 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Biden doesn't run again, a number of Democrats are expected to wade into the presidential waters. But even Vice President Harris isn't seen as a definitive leading contender in such a situation, Democrats acknowledge privately.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There's not one clear candidate and there’s not a rising star,” said one top Democratic donor.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here's who is generating the most talk and the most confidence.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kamala Harris </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Harris, 57, has seen her own approval ratings fall at times during an up-and-down tenure as vice president, she remains the top non-Biden possibility for 2024.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strategists say it would be difficult to convince Black women — who helped catapult Biden to the White House — to vote for anyone else as the party’s standard-bearer.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as one strategist pointed out, “No one is going to win the nomination without winning in the South.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Harris had a rocky start during the first year of the administration, generating headlines for both gaffes and a string of staff departures, she has settled into the role.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She has also made women’s rights one of her issues out on the trail, an issue that can only help her political prospects with the Democratic base as the Supreme Court decision overturning the Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion rights continues to reverberate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pete Buttigieg </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Transportation secretary has been a popular figure in the Democratic Party since his 2020 presidential run, when he surprised the base with his come-out-of-nowhere ascent.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buttigieg’s current role has sent him around the country to boast about popular infrastructure projects —something that can only help him down the road.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just last month, Buttigieg, 40, appeared in the swing states of Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada and Ohio.  Buttigieg’s stature with voters could have taken a beating with the railway strike earlier this month but after Biden’s late-hour intervention, it never amounted, solidifying his standing with Democratic voters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two Biden administration fixtures are the top two non-Biden Democrats on our list.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most likely alternatives after them are two governors.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is Michigan’s governor, who came closer than many realize to being Biden’s pick for vice president.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Whitmer, 51, is catching the eyes of Democrats as she runs for reelection.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, she opened up a 16-point lead over her Republican opponent Tudor Dixon in a Detroit Free Press poll.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whitmer has made it a point to lean in on abortion rights, in particular. At a recent event she highlighted her role in the fight.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The only reason Michigan continues to be pro-choice state is because of my veto and my lawsuit,” she said, according to CNN. The remarks refer to a lawsuit Whitmer filed to prevent a Michigan abortion ban from happening.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She often points out she filed the lawsuit even before Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court in June, a move that will surely appeal to the base in the coming years.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gov. Gavin Newsom  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a time when Democrats have been craving a leader who would get in the faces of Republicans, Newsom, the California governor, appeared to do battle.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Newsom, 54, made headlines in July when he took the fight directly to Ron DeSantis (R), running an ad in the Sunshine State blasting the Florida governor and the conservative culture there.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Freedom, it’s under attack in your state. Republican leaders, they’re banning books, making it harder to vote, restricting speech in classrooms, even criminalizing women and doctors,” he said in the spot, which ran on Fox News programming throughout the state.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month, he continued his aggressive stance by paying for billboards in some conservative states including Mississippi, Texas, Indiana and Oklahoma. His message? That abortion is still legal in California. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He has still got a lot to prove but he has certainly made Democrats pay attention,” one strategist said.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one-time presidential hopeful has made it clear she has one race on her mind in 2024: her own reelection to the Senate.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Democrats say there would be a place for her if Biden decides not to run again.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warren, 73, has continued to be a top advocate on Capitol Hill for issues important to Democrats including climate change, abortion rights and gun safety.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when she’s asked about the next presidential election, she consistently punts.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’ve got to stop the catnip about 2024,” she told Axios this summer. “If we start getting tangled up on 2024, and fail to pay attention to business in 2022, that is not only going to hurt us in 2022. It is going to bite us on the rear end in 2024.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen.

        "description": "<p>(NEXSTAR) – James Earl Jones is reportedly seeking something akin to an honorable discharge from the never-ending “Star Wars.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 91-year-old actor, who has voiced Darth Vader across multiple entries in the sci-fi franchise since 1977, had reportedly “signed off” on plans to replace Vader’s upcoming dialogue with a blend of archival recordings and A.I. technology after hearing how well the new tech could mimic his trademark voice, according to Vanity Fair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vanity Fair briefly touched on Jones’ decision in an article published Friday, which focused on the Ukrainian start-up tasked by Lucasfilm with replicating the veteran actor’s voice for the Disney+ series “Obi-Wan Kenobi.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat’s in Disney’s $5,000 Star Wars cocktail?\t\n\n\n\n\n<p>The article specifically noted that the Ukrainian company, called Respeecher, was hired to help out with the new dialogue “now that Jones’s voice has altered with age and he has stepped back from the role.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthew Wood, a sound editor at Lucasfilm's Skywalker Sound studios, further told the outlet that Jones “had mentioned he was looking into winding down this particular character.” Not particularly surprising, considering he last voiced Vader in 2019’s “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wood indicated, however, that Jones is still somewhat involved in the franchise, and lends advice to the editors on the character’s future appearances. He also described Jones as a “benevolent grandfather” when asked by Vanity Fair to outline the actor’s contribution to Vader’s most recent turns in “Obi-Wan Kenobi.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s unclear what plans Disney and Lucasfilm have for Darth Vader in upcoming projects, but if history is any indication, he’s not going anywhere anytime soon. More than 45 years after his debut, the character has continued to appear in films, television series, animated programs and video games — all mediums which, seemingly, will soon need to rely on synthesized speech.</p>",

(credit: Samuel Axon)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For the past couple of years, Apple’s annual iOS updates have laser focused on one feature for an overhaul while making smaller tweaks to everything else. Last year, Focus was the, well, focus. The year before that, it was the home screen.</p>\n<p>This time it’s the lock screen. You can now change fonts, add widgets, customize the information displayed, and pick from a wider variety of wallpaper. Apple has also more deeply integrated the lock screen with the Focus modes that were fleshed out in iOS 15. And it has laid the groundwork for something more than just notifications that third-party apps can show you before you unlock your phone.</p>\n<p>Given the increasingly iterative nature of iOS releases today—with many key features not arriving until months after the initial ship date of a new, whole-numbered version—we’re moving to leaner initial iOS reviews, with updates to come in additional articles over time. So today we’re going to look at the main new feature of iOS 16, but we’ll touch on a couple of other key features and changes, too.</p><p>Read 68 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

(credit: Samuel Axon)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For the past couple of years, Apple’s annual iOS updates have laser focused on one feature for an overhaul while making smaller tweaks to everything else. Last year, Focus was the, well, focus. The year before that, it was the home screen.</p>\n<p>This time it’s the lock screen. You can now change fonts, add widgets, customize the information displayed, and pick from a wider variety of wallpaper. Apple has also more deeply integrated the lock screen with the Focus modes that were fleshed out in iOS 15. And it has laid the groundwork for something more than just notifications that third-party apps can show you before you unlock your phone.</p>\n<p>Given the increasingly iterative nature of iOS releases today—with many key features not arriving until months after the initial ship date of a new, whole-numbered version—we’re moving to leaner initial iOS reviews, with updates to come in additional articles over time. So today we’re going to look at the main new feature of iOS 16, but we’ll touch on a couple of other key features and changes, too.</p><p>Read 68 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

The home has since been lost.Rene Roy/Wreckhouse Press via AP<p>Updated September 25, 2022 at 5:14 AM ET</p><p>TORONTO — Canadian troops are being sent to assist the recovery from the devastation of storm Fiona, which swept away houses, stripped off roofs and knocked out power across the country's Atlantic provinces.</p><p>After surging north from the Caribbean as a hurricane, Fiona came ashore before dawn Saturday as a post-tropical cyclone, battering Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Quebec with hurricane-strength winds, heavy rains and huge waves.</p><p>Defense Minister Anita Anand said Saturday that troops would help remove fallen trees and other debris, restore transportation links and do whatever else is required for as long as it takes. She didn't specify how many troops would be deployed.</p><p>Fiona was blamed for at least five deaths in the Caribbean, but there was no confirmation of any fatalities or serious injuries in Canada. Police said a woman who might have been swept away was listed as missing in the town of Channel-Port Aux Basques on the southern coast of Newfoundland.</p><p>Raging surf pounded Port Aux Basques and entire structures were washed into the sea.</p><p>\"I'm seeing homes in the ocean. I'm seeing rubble floating all over the place. It's complete and utter destruction. There's an apartment that is gone,\" René J. Roy, chief editor at Wreckhouse Press and a resident of the twon, said in a phone interview.</p><p>Roy estimated between eight to 12 houses and buildings had washed into the sea. \"It's quite terrifying,\" he said.</p><p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the town of 4,000 people was in a state of emergency with multiple electrical fires and residential flooding.</p><p>As the extent of damage became clear, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau canceled his trip to Japan for the funeral for assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</p><p>\"We are seeing devastating images coming out of Port aux Basques. PEI (Prince Edward Island) has experienced storm damage like they've never seen. Cape Breton is being hit hard, too,\" Trudeau said.</p><p>\"There are people who see their houses destroyed, people who are very worried — we will be there for you,\" Trudeau added.</p><p>Mike Savage, mayor of Halifax, said the roof of an apartment building collapsed in Nova Scotia's biggest city and officials had moved 100 people to an evacuation center. He said no one was seriously hurt.</p><p>Provincial officials said other apartment buildings sustained significant damage.</p><p>More than 415,000 Nova Scotia Power customers — about 80% of the province of almost 1 million people — were affected by outages Saturday. Over 82,000 customers in the province of Prince Edward Island, about 95%, also lost power, while NB Power in New Brunswick reported 44,329 were without electricity.</p>A fallen tree rests on a house early Saturday in Halifax after Fiona's strong rains and winds lashed the Atlantic Canada region.Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press via AP<p>Peter Gregg, president and CEO of Nova Scotia Power, said unprecedented peak winds inflicted severe damage and the bad weather kept repair crews from going out at first. He said about 380,000 customers remained without power Saturday afternoon as a weakening Fiona moved away over the Gulf of St. Lawrence.</p><p>The Canadian Hurricane Centre tweeted that Fiona had the lowest pressure ever recorded for a storm making landfall in Canada. Forecasters had warned it could be the one of the most powerful storms to hit the country.</p><p>\"We're getting more severe storms more frequently,\" Trudeau said.</p><p>He said more resilient infrastructure is needed to withstand extreme weather events, saying that what was once a one-in-100 year storm might now arrive every few years because of climate change.</p><p>\"Things are only getting worse,\" Trudeau said.</p><p>A state of local emergency was declared in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality.</p>Damage is visible in Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador, caused by post Tropical Storm Fiona on Saturday.Rosalyn Roy/Wreckhouse Press via The Canadian Press via AP<p>\"There are homes that have been significantly damaged due to downed trees, big old trees falling down and causing significant damage,\" Mayor Amanda McDougall told The Associated Press. \"We're also seeing houses that their roofs have completely torn off, windows breaking in. There is a huge amount of debris in the roadways.\"</p><p>Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said roads were washed out, including his own, and said an \"incredible\" amount of trees had been blown over.</p><p>\"It is pretty devastating,\" Houston said.</p><p>Prince Edward Island Premier Dennis King said few communities were spared damage, with the devastation looking to be beyond anything they had seen previously in the province.</p><p>Federal Minister of Emergency Preparedness Bill Blair said there was very extensive damage at the airport in Sydney, Nova Scotia. He said other airports also were hit, but that damage at the Halifax facility, Nova Scotia's largest airport, was minor.</p><p>In Sydney, Nova Scotia, the largest city on Cape Breton, about 20 people took refuge at the Centre 200 sports and entertainment facility, said Christina Lamey, a spokeswoman for the region. Lamey said hundreds of people had been displaced in the province.</p><p>Arlene and Robert Grafilo fled to Centre 200 with their children, ages 3 and 10, after a big tree toppled on their duplex apartment.</p><p>\"We were trapped and we couldn't open the doors and the windows, so that's when we decided to call 911,\" Arlene Grafilo said. She said firefighters eventually rescued them.</p><p>Peter MacKay, a former foreign minister and defense minister who lives in Nova Scotia, said he had never seen anything to match Fiona even though he has \"lived through some crazy weather.\"</p><p>He said that he and his family had a long night and that the winds had raged into the afternoon.</p><p>\n\"We had put everything we could out of harm's way, but the house got hammered pretty hard. Lost lots of shingles, heavy water damage in ceilings, walls, our deck is destroyed. A garage that I was building blew away,\" MacKay said in an email to AP.\n</p><p>Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "<p>More than 40 House Democrats on Friday urged the Biden Justice Department to open an investigation into Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ inhumane scheme that transported dozens of migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, alleging the Republican leader and other officials involved may have violated federal law.</p>\n<p>“Harrowing interviews and reports reveal officials in Florida intentionally misled the migrants to believe they would be flown to Boston to receive expedited work papers,” the 44 Democratic lawmakers wrote in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland.</p>\n<p>“Instead, the deceived migrants were packed onto buses, put onto two privately chartered flights, and prohibited from taking photos of the journey that made two unannounced stops before landing in Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts,” the letter continues. “It is alleged that immigration officials knowingly falsified mailing addresses for the migrants by selecting arbitrary homeless shelters across the United States, with the expectation that migrants would be required to attend court proceedings as early as next week in states thousands of miles away or face forced removal.”</p>\n<p>Spearheaded by Reps. Gerry Connolly (Va.), Sylvia Garcia (Texas), Ted Lieu (Calif.), and Mondaire Jones (N.Y.), the letter calls on the Justice Department to “investigate whether any federal funds were used to operate a fraudulent scheme and request the Department of Justice make a determination as to whether officials in Texas and Florida violated federal law.”</p>\n<p>“The actions of the officials in Texas and Florida were not only fundamentally cruel and uniquely un-American; there remains a likelihood that federal laws were violated,” the House Democrats wrote.</p>\n\n<p>NEW: I teamed up with @RepSylviaGarcia, @RepTedLieu, @RepMondaire, and 41 of our colleagues to request a DOJ investigation into the cruel migrant flights organized by Republicans.https://t.co/SzQKRSya61 pic.twitter.com/WFcttS3cri</p>\n<p>— Rep. Gerry Connolly (@GerryConnolly) September 23, 2022</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Dozens of migrants arrived in Massachusetts last week after DeSantis — in partnership with the GOP-aligned aviation firm Vertol Systems — arranged for them to be flown to Martha’s Vineyard from San Antonio, using human beings as props for political messaging. A Texas sheriff on Monday launched a criminal investigation into the ploy, which he said “preyed upon” the vulnerable migrants.</p>\n<p>Texas’ Republican governor, Greg Abbott, who has engaged in similar schemes, insists he wasn’t involved in the flights organized by the Florida government.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, some of the Venezuelan asylum-seekers filed a federal class-action lawsuit alleging that DeSantis and Florida’s transportation secretary “designed and executed a premeditated, fraudulent, and illegal scheme centered on exploiting this vulnerability for the sole purpose of advancing their own personal, financial, and political interests.”</p>\n<p>Numerous state-level officials, including Massachusetts Rep. Dylan Fernandes, have demanded a federal probe, characterizing the Florida governor’s actions as “fraud, kidnapping, deprivation of liberty, and human trafficking.” Members of Massachusetts’ congressional delegation, meanwhile, have pressured the U.S. Treasury Department to investigate the matter, citing possible abuse of federal funds.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Florida state Sen. Jason Pizzo, a Democrat, has filed a lawsuit aiming to bar DeSantis from spending any more taxpayer money on the migrant flights.</p>\n<p>In their letter on Friday, the 44 House Democrats stressed that “the federal government retains jurisdiction over cases that involve interstate travel” and should intervene.</p>\n<p>“The Bexar County, Texas sheriff’s office has already opened a criminal investigation into this scheme,” they wrote. “We urge your department to do the same and conduct a thorough investigation and deliver accountability to those that violated the law.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>Jackson, Mississippi — In mid-September, Howard Sanders bumped down pothole-ridden streets in a white Cadillac weighed down with water bottles on his way to a home in Ward 3, a neglected neighborhood that he called “a war zone.”</p>\n<p>Sanders, director of marketing and outreach for Central Mississippi Health Services, was then greeted at the door by Johnnie Jones. Since Jones’ hip surgery about a month ago, the 74-year-old had used a walker to get around and hadn’t been able to get to any of the city’s water distribution sites.</p>\n<p>Jackson’s routine water woes became so dire in late August that President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency: Flooding and water treatment facility problems had shut down the majority-Black city’s water supply. Although water pressure returned and a boil-water advisory was lifted in mid-September, the problems aren’t over.</p>\n<p>Bottled water is still a way of life. The city’s roughly 150,000 residents must stay alert — making sure they don’t rinse their toothbrushes with tap water, keeping their mouths closed while they shower, rethinking cooking plans, or budgeting for gas so they can drive around looking for water. Many residents purchase bottled water on top of paying water bills, meaning less money for everything else. For Jackson’s poorest and oldest residents, who can’t leave their homes or lift water cases, avoiding dubious water becomes just that much harder.</p>\n<p>“We are shellshocked, we’re traumatized,” Sanders said.</p>\n<p>Jackson’s water woes are a manifestation of a deeper health crisis in Mississippi, whose residents have pervasive chronic diseases. It is the state with the lowest life expectancy and the highest rate of infant mortality.</p>\n<p>“The water is a window into that neglect that many people have experienced for much of their lives,” said Richard Mizelle Jr., a historian of medicine at the University of Houston. “Using bottled water for the rest of your life is not sustainable.”</p>\n<p>But in Jackson an alternative doesn’t exist, said Dr. Robert Smith. He founded Central Mississippi Health Services in 1963 as an outgrowth of his work on civil rights, and the organization now operates four free clinics in the Jackson area. He often sees patients with multiple health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or heart problems. And unsafe water could lead to death for people who do their dialysis at home, immunocompromised individuals, or babies who drink formula, said Smith.</p>\n<p>Residents filed a lawsuit this month against the city and private engineering firms responsible for the city’s water system, claiming they had experienced a host of health problems — dehydration, malnutrition, lead poisoning, E. coli exposure, hair loss, skin rashes, and digestive issues — as a result of contaminated water. The lawsuit alleges that Jackson’s water has elevated lead levels, a finding confirmed by the Mississippi State Department of Health.</p>\n<p>While Jackson’s current water situation is extreme, many communities of color, low-income communities, and those with a large share of non-native English speakers also have unsafe water, said Erik Olson, senior strategic director for health and food at the Natural Resources Defense Council. These communities are more frequently subjected to Safe Drinking Water Act violations, according to a study by the nonprofit advocacy group. And it takes longer for those communities to come back into compliance with the law, Olson said.</p>\n<p>The federal infrastructure bill passed last year includes $50 billion to improve the country’s drinking water and wastewater systems. Although Mississippi is set to receive $429 million of that funding over five years, Jackson must wait — and fight — for its share.</p>\n<p>And communities often spend years with lingering illness and trauma. Five years after the start of the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, about 20% of the city’s adult residents had clinical depression, and nearly a quarter had post-traumatic stress disorder, according to a recent paper published in JAMA.</p>\n<p>Jones, like many locals, hasn’t trusted Jackson’s water in decades. That distrust — and the constant vigilance, extra expenses, and hassle — add a layer of psychological strain.</p>\n<p>“It is very stressful,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>For the city’s poorest communities, the water crisis sits on top of existing stressors, including crime and unstable housing, said Dr. Obie McNair, chief operating officer of Central Mississippi Health Services. “It’s additive.”</p>\n<p>Over time, that effort and adjustment take a toll, said Mauda Monger, chief operating officer at My Brother’s Keeper, a community health equity nonprofit in Jackson. Chronic stress and the inability to access care can exacerbate chronic illnesses and lead to preterm births, all of which are prevalent in Jackson. “Bad health outcomes don’t happen in a short period of time,” she said.</p>\n<p>For Jackson’s health clinics, the water crisis has reshaped their role. To prevent health complications that can come from drinking or bathing in dirty water, they have been supplying the city’s most needy with clean water.</p>\n<p>“We want to be a part of the solution,” McNair said.</p>\n<p>Community health centers in the state have a long history of filling gaps in services for Mississippi’s poorest residents, said Terrence Shirley, CEO of the Community Health Center Association of Mississippi. “Back in the day, there were times when community health centers would actually go out and dig wells for their patients.”</p>\n<p>Central Mississippi Health Services had been holding water giveaways for residents about two times a month since February 2021, when a winter storm left Jackson without water for weeks.</p>\n<p>But in August, things got so bad again that Sanders implored listeners of a local radio show to call the center if they couldn’t get water. Many Jackson residents can’t make it to the city’s distribution sites because of work schedules, lack of transportation, or a physical impairment.</p>\n<p>“Now, all of a sudden, I am the water man,” Sanders said.</p>\n<p>Thelma Kinney Cornelius, 72, first heard about Sanders’ water deliveries from his radio appearances. She hasn’t been able to drive since her treatment for intestinal cancer in 2021. She rarely cooks these days. But she made an exception a few Sundays ago, going through a case of bottled water to make a pot of rice and peas.</p>\n<p>“It’s a lot of adjustment trying to get into that routine,” said Cornelius. “It’s hard.”</p>\n<p>The day that Jackson’s boil-water advisory was lifted, Sanders was diagnosed with a hernia, probably from lifting heavy water cases, he said. Still, the following day, Sanders drove around the Virden Addition neighborhood with other volunteers, knocking on people’s doors and asking whether they needed water.</p>\n<p>He said he has no plans to stop water deliveries as Jackson residents continue to deal with the long-term fallout from the summer’s crisis. Residents are still worried about lead or other harmful contaminants lurking in the water.</p>\n<p>“It’s like a little Third World country over here,” Sanders said. “In all honesty, we will probably be on this for the next year.”</p>\n<p>KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

        "description": "<p>Minneapolis, Minnesota – The Michels Corporation, headed by Trump-endorsed Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels, has contracts with the City of Minneapolis and an exclusive contract with CenterPoint Energy to service gas lines in Minneapolis, which raises concerns for residents. </p>\n<p>In 2015, Minneapolis resident DeCourcy Squire shut off the gas to her Stevens Square condo, stopped paying the Houston based gas conglomerate, CenterPoint Energy (CPE), and began using alternative energy to power her home. She had been a tax resister ever since the Vietnam War, and after becoming involved with the grassroots group MN350 working to oppose the Line 3 Dakota Access Pipeline, she could not in good conscience contribute to the gas company any longer. </p>\n<p>Squire told Unicorn Riot that she first learned about Michels Corporation while protesting Line 3, but didn’t realize they had an exclusive contract with CenterPoint Energy until recently. </p>\n<p>“Pushing for corporate divestment is very important but I think personal divestment is also a small step towards an alternative future,” Squire said, not just referring to alternative energy but also alternative politics free of corporate influence. </p>\n<p>The Michels Corporation, including its subsidiaries Michels Pipeline, Inc, Michels Power, Inc., Michels Construction, Inc., Michels Utility Services, Inc., Michels Trenchless, Inc., Michels Road and Stone, Inc., and Michels Pacific Energy, Inc., has become one of the largest utility contractors in North America. Many Twin Cities activists first became aware of them through the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) construction, as reported by Unicorn Riot. </p>\n<p>Michels currently has three offices in Minnesota, their newest being the Brooklyn Park office which opened in 2017, adding to its Lakeville and Rogers sites. According to Michels website, their goal is to expand service capabilities in the Midwest.</p>\n<p>CenterPoint Energy’s website lists 27 active projects within Minneapolis alone, including Minnehaha, Hiawatha, Fulton, Kenwood, and Jordan neighborhoods, all using Michels Corporation. </p>\nAs Transportation Funds Increase, So Do Michels’ Revenues\n<p>Michels Corp. and Michels Pipeline Construction have involvement in several special interest groups, especially three main lobby associations — Wisconsin Transportation Building Association, Transportation Development Association, and Construction Business Group, all with the primary aim to increase state transportation funds, allowing for more public contract money to flow directly to the Michels Corporation. </p>\n<p>In the 2022 election cycle, individual employees and immediate family members of Michels Corporation have donated an accumulated $46,142 to campaigns, with the Republican National Convention (RNC) being the largest recipient of $20,000, according to the research group OpenSecrets, a national organization that tracks money in elections and its effects on public policy. This amount is far lower than the $134,905 the RNC received from Michels affiliates in the 2020 election cycle. Recent campaign donations to Republican congressional candidate Derrick Van Orden and U.S. Representative Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin has also been tracked to individuals from the Michels Corporation in the amounts of $17,399 and $4,650 respectively. </p>\n<p>Wisconsin Right Now, a conservative news outlet, found that Michels’ involvement in special interest groups, with Michels executives serving in lieu of himself, has helped the company acquire nearly 1.2 billion dollars in contracts with the state of Wisconsin, implying public-private profiteering. The Minneapolis based news site Southwest Voices reported that Michels Corp. has $12.7 million in contracts with the City of Minneapolis since the start of 2020 alone.</p>\n<p>While there is no official tie to Michels personally lobbying for increased gas taxes, higher registration fees, and blocking tax exemptions on gas and diesel fuel sold to school districts, it is clear that special interest groups Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association, which Michels served as Board President, and the Transportation Development Association, where Michels served on the executive board, have contributed financially to groups fighting to increase the gas tax. </p>\n<p>Both the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that if Tim Michels wins the Wisconsin governorship, he said he will divest from the Michels Corporation, leaving his two brothers in charge. Regardless, if Michels becomes Wisconsin’s next governor, his family company and special interest groups will have one of their own at the helm of decisionmaking on government contracts and public utilities spending. </p>\n<p>Michels admittedly said that he wants his family to continue seeking state-wide contracts, despite obvious political conflicts of interest. The company’s contracts in just the last five years from the state of Wisconsin exceed $660 million in payments.</p>\nTim Michels’ Right-Wing Gubernatorial Campaign\n<p>In 2021, Michels announced his candidacy for governor of Wisconsin. But Wisconsin residents have challenged Michels’ residency, pointing to his East Coast homes where he lives much of the year, including his seventeen-million-dollar mansion in Connecticut and luxury penthouse on New York City’s Upper East Side. </p>\n<p>In June 2022, former President Trump endorsed Michels, who has supported the “big lie” that Trump won the 2020 election and has suggested he will work to overturn the state’s 2020 election results if he wins in November. He vowed to abolish the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission which administers and enforces state election laws. Additionally, Michels has doubled down in recent cultural wars committing to fight so-called ‘critical race theory’ (CRT) being taught in public schools, abortion and more. </p>\n<p>Michels has been outspoken about his anti-abortion stance and says he’d ban abortion and emergency contraceptives if elected Wisconsin governor. “I believe God is unhappy with the country that allows for the killing of babies,” he said at an event in Calumet County, WI. </p>\n<p>Polls throughout 2022 consistently had former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch ahead as the favorite in the Wisconsin Republican gubernatorial primary by a comfortable margin. Kleefisch is supported by her former boss, the past GOP rising star, former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. However, Michels won the Republican primary on August 9, the day after the FBI raided Mar-a-Lago, with 47% of the vote, beating Kleefisch by five points.</p>\nResidents React to the Minneapolis–Michels Connection\n<p>Residents in Minnesota and Wisconsin are concerned about Michels Corp.’s ongoing government contracts and its exclusive partnership with CenterPoint Energy, which holds a monopoly on natural gas in the Twin Cities. These concerns are becoming intensified now as they become aware of their unwitting contribution to Michels’ campaign. </p>\n<p>“I wonder if I’m paying for this unnecessary MPD protection &amp; supporting Tim Michels for governor through my CenterPoint bill or directly to MPD with my property taxes?” Nikki Carlson, who uses the handle @M_Nikki_dUrso, tweeted. </p>\n<p>Carlson, who is a North Minneapolis resident, took to Twitter on July 13 to share her encounter with a Michels worker. She observed what she believed was an ineffective use of Minneapolis law enforcement. </p>\n\n<p>“I asked the Michels guy why there are so many police squads there. He said to guard their employees while working in ‘the ghetto.’”</p>\n\n\n<p>Another use of Minneapolis Police Department, 1 block from my house. Gas lines being replaced along 16th from Bryant-Penn in North Mpls this summer. I asked the Michels guy why there are so many police squads there. He said to guard their employees while working in the ghetto. /1 pic.twitter.com/e3Qiv3vJqq</p>\n<p>— Domestic Infant Supply '65 (@M_Nikki_dUrso) July 13, 2022</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>North Minneapolis is the historic Black section of the city that has been over-policed and under-resourced for generations, activists say. </p>\n<p>The Michels’ worker told Carlson that police protection was a condition of their contract. However, Michels has been seen working in other parts of the city by residents without police protection. </p>\n<p>One person tweeted that Michels’ staff vehicles have far-right bumper stickers on them that make residents feel “very uneasy.”</p>\n<p>Minneapolis residents have also raised concerns about Michels’ hiring practices and worry that the company apparently doesn’t hire Black people. “WHY is this co. laying pipe in N. Mpls &amp; putting their workers from Wright County in hotels when we have qualified people right here?” Carlson tweeted. </p>\n<p>Minneapolis City Council President Andrea Jenkins has expressed these same concerns in emails. “I share many of the concerns you’ve identified and have brought these issues up with CenterPoint Energy many times…While it is true that our utilities payments support the Michels company, no taxpayer dollars support this, in fact the utility companies have to pay for permits to the city to do the work.” </p>\n<p>However, Michels Corp. has several contracts with the city’s Public Works Department paid by Minneapolis taxpayers, which was reported last month by Southwest Voices.</p>\n<p>Although Minneapolis police (MPD) are providing security for Michels while they do work in North Minneapolis, cops are being privately paid through its contract with CPE, Council Member Jenkins said. </p>\n<p>MPD is allowed to wear their city uniforms and drive taxpayer-funded squad cars while working off-duty security jobs for private companies. </p>\n<p>However, Fox 9 recently found MPD protecting Target and Michels construction crews during their regular shift. “During those day shifts, Fox 9 cameras found officers stationed around retail stores and construction sites.”</p>\n\n<p>“During those day shifts, Fox 9 cameras found officers stationed around retail stores and construction sites”</p>\n<p>Yup. Not hard to find… https://t.co/X7SwWAY5XQ pic.twitter.com/VZyoEi2vKC</p>\n<p>— Dimitri Drekonja (@Ddrekonja) September 15, 2022</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Carlson tweeted that a drunk cop working security for Michels aggressively confronted her and implied that they are indeed being paid by taxpayers. “Angry intoxicated MPD officer just told me it isn’t about preserving police resources to focus on violent crime, it’s about OVERTIME pay for light duty &amp; I need to STFU. (&amp; everyone but me knows this).” She reacted, “I was naive thinking the objective was public safety.”</p>\n<p>MPD is said to inform contractors in construction when and if they need protection, according to a source. </p>\n<p>Jenkins added, “To be clear, I find the response of the Michels employee to the Northside resident’s question to be despicable, Michels needs to create a more diverse workforce that reflects the communities they serve.” However, the city council president made no commitment to take any action. </p>\n<p>One resident who uses the handle @JenAntila tweeted that when their sewer line failed over a decade ago, a city public works employee gave them a list of city approved sewer line contractors and said, “‘I can’t recommend anyone but my pen slipped,’ Michels was circled. I hired them.”</p>\n<p>@JenAntila told Unicorn Riot that it was mid January when her sewer line failed and that Michels did a good job repairing it. But she also regrets her decision after discovering the politics of the company. “I just hate knowing what an a-hole [Tim] Michels is and knowing how much the city and &amp; constituents (like me) bankroll him and have for decades.” </p>\n<p>“These are the same a$$holes that last summer were tearing up forests, wet lands &amp; waters in Northern MN to put in another Enbridge pipeline,” tweeted another. </p>\n<p>Residents noted the irony of Minneapolis cops calling the city dangerous while the same officers are being used to protect private companies rather than protecting the public. </p>\n<p>“These police officers care more about protecting out-of-towners from imaginary danger than protecting their own citizens from real danger,” one user tweeted.</p>\n<p>Also, residents claim that police have intentionally made the city more dangerous by slowing down their work and threatening not to exit their squad cars while patrolling. </p>\n<p>“And they say they don’t have staff to patrol/have a constant presence in Dinkytown at night,” tweeted another.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>As Trump-endorsed Republican, Tim Michels solidifies his conservative ideologies in Wisconsin’s gubernatorial race, it remains unclear to Minneapolis residents just how much they are funding his right-wing campaign steeped in anti-democracy rhetoric, simply by paying taxes and their monthly gas bill. </p>\n<p>“Minnesota’s energy dollars are supporting a candidate for governor of Wisconsin that wants to ban all abortions with no exceptions for rape and incest. He opposes same-sex marriage and all LGBQT rights. Is that what we want? I know I don’t,” Carlson told Unicorn Riot.</p>\n<p>While the exact dollar amount coming from Minneapolis residents into Michels’ campaign cannot be estimated, it is apparent that Tim Michels is profiteering from his company’s contracts with the City of Minneapolis Public Works Department and its exclusive contract with CenterPoint Energy, helping fund his race — with Michels being the largest donor to his campaign at $11,940,882.25 of the $12 million raised. </p>\n<p>Nathaniel Guthrie, who goes by the Twitter handle @WoodGhuthriempls, suggested boycotting CPE. ​​“Imagine that, Centerpoint energy supports racists. We can’t be shocked that the cops do, but this open cowardice and racism from Michels corporation should be stressed to center point.” Adding, “Be a shame if we all here in ‘the ghetto’ stopped paying them en masse.”</p>\n<p>Unicorn Riot called and emailed several people at CenterPoint Energy for this story. When we asked CenterPoint Energy’s Director of Communications in Minneapolis, Hannah Gullickson, if CPE will respond to the numerous residents who object to funding Michels’ right-wing campaign through their gas bills, she said she doesn’t speak to the press and forwarded the message to Ross Corson, Senior Communications Specialist. We have not received an immediate response from Corson</p>",

        "link": "https://truthout.org/articles/international-interference-in-haiti-is-crushing-its-garment-industry/",
        "description": "<p>Even before Haiti’s unelected de facto and extremely unpopular Prime Minister Ariel Henry shocked an already economically burdened Haitian populace by announcing on September 11 that he was ending fuel subsidies (a single gallon of gas now costs $4.79 in U.S. currency), the Haitian economy has been taking hit after hit from its foreign “investors.” Conflicts concerning who has the right to govern Haiti, and for what term, have torn up the country since prior to the assassination of Haitian President Jovenal Moïse in his Port-au-Prince home in July 2021. Moïse had selected Henry as Haiti’s prime minister just two days before he was trapped in his bedroom, roughed up (the autopsy showed several broken bones) and then slain in a hail of 15 bullets, one of which exploded his heart.</p>\n<p>After a two-week power struggle between Henry and the then-incumbent Prime Minister Claude Joseph, Henry prevailed and assumed power on July 21, becoming Haiti’s seventh prime minister in four years. Henry’s alignment with the foreign oligarchic forces suppressing Haiti politically and economically was a factor in Daniel Foote’s resignation as U.S. Special Envoy a year ago. As Truthout reported, Foote did not mince words when criticizing the Biden administration for its decision to support Henry: “[W]hat our Haitian friends really want, and need, is the opportunity to chart their own course, without international puppeteering and favored candidates,” Foote wrote. “The hubris that makes us believe we should pick the winner — again — is impressive.”</p>\n<p>While Foote’s historic act was noted, it was not heeded, and continued U.S. support of Henry has come grievously home to roost. In mid-July, a major foreign apparel company operating in Haiti announced massive layoffs in the garment sector, passing along the pain of what they say has been a 45 percent reduction in orders from major U.S. customers such as Target, Walmart and The Gap to Haitian workers and their families. Other companies have also indicated that mass layoffs are likely, and industry insiders have predicted that an estimated 20,000 jobs could soon disappear, according to local reports. This represents over 34 percent of all workers in the garment industry, which accounts for nearly 90 percent of Haiti’s exports. Some factories, such as Go Haiti which laid off 800 workers, have already closed up shop entirely, and Val D’Or CEO Robert Rothbaum stands accused of illegally shuttering the apparel company’s Port-au-Prince factory without notice in January, and absconding with 1,000 Haitian workers’ wages and severance pay.</p>\n<p>That indignity, along with an inflation rate that was in excess of 22 percent making it impossible for Haitian workers to close the gap between their meager sweatshop earnings and the cost of basic human necessities, led to an industry-wide strike that won workers some modest gains: On February 21, the Superior Council on Wages acted to raise the minimum wage for garment worker to 770 gourdes (or $6.63 in U.S. currency) a day, which amounts to roughly half of what they were demanding. But with the rate of inflation now at 30.5 percent, those gains have been eroded and then some. In such desperate times, a job, even one that’s woefully compensated, is arguably better than no job at all.</p>\nGrassroots Unite in Opposition to Ariel Henry Continuing as De Facto Prime Minister\n<p>Even in the midst of the current widespread turmoil, labor unions and workers’ rights advocates in Haiti are sounding a screeching alarm about the layoffs that are expected to happen by year end. They are explicitly connecting the issue to international interference with Haiti’s political sovereignty, especially the continued imposition of the U.S.-backed Henry, who critics say has stood squarely in the way of democratic self-governance.</p>\n<p>In an open letter last month to S&amp;H Global SA, the subsidiary corporation of a South Korean company which said it will reduce its workforce in Haiti from 10,000 workers to 6,000, the Autonomous Central of Haitian Workers (CATH) called the deep cuts “illegal, unjustified, and unjustifiable.” The labor union’s letter cries out against the proposed layoffs and the union-busting tactics used against workers attempting to advance garment workers’ rights, and demands restitution for harms against them.</p>\nAn estimated 20,000 jobs could soon disappear, according to local reports. This represents over 34 percent of all workers in the garment industry, which accounts for nearly 90 percent of Haiti’s exports. \n<p>The Bureau des Avocats Internationaux (BAI), a law firm based in Port-au-Prince that represents unions in their fight against labor rights abuses in Haiti, is pressing the money damages case for the Val D’Or workers. In a blistering press release, the labor law firm blames the proposed massive layoffs on the stranglehold that foreign business interests have on the garment sector. The firm points to a number of key formal legal mechanisms in loan and trade programs that have been disastrously imposed on Haiti over the years by The Core Group, the very same multinational supervisory body to which Ariel Henry answers. Imposed upon Haiti by the United Nations in 2004 after the U.S.-backed coup of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, The Core Group is charged with “steering the electoral process.” Comprised of ambassadors to Haiti from Brazil, the European Union, France, Germany, Spain and the United States, in addition to representatives to Haiti from the Organization of American States and the United Nations, its creation was originally proposed as a six-month interim transition support measure, yet it endures to this day. Many Haitians understandably see Henry as being in cahoots with the enemy, defined in this instance as foreign states exploiting (and now blithely discarding) the Haitian workforce, enabled by Haiti’s entrenched oligarchic forces.</p>\n<p>BAI also calls out a turn in U.S. foreign policy so intent in controlling Haiti’s politics that it perversely acts against the business interests of U.S. companies that have, until recently, been able to richly profit from low-cost apparel goods manufactured in Haiti. BAI’s September 8 press release states:</p>\n\n<p>This is most recently manifest in U.S. support for de facto Prime Minister Ariel Henry and his repressive and undemocratic government, whose policies drive many of Haiti’s current challenges — including the deteriorating security situation that is pushing foreign investors out of the country. “Haitians do not need more conditioned loans and sweatshops,” explains BIA Managing Attorney Mario Joseph. “If the international community really wants to help, they should stop interfering in our democracy and investing in jobs that inhibit our self-sufficiency and fail to give back to the community.”</p>\n\n<p>In its announcement, S&amp;H Global attributed the reduction of demand by its customers which precipitated the layoffs to “the recent economic decline in the US market.” But Ose Pierre, a representative of the Solidarity Center who is living among, organizing with and talking to garment workers every day, says the nebulous statement makes sense. “They don’t want to say that there’s a problem because there’s no order,” Pierre told Truthout by telephone from Port-au-Prince, “because of the political situation in Haiti.”</p>\n<p>In Pierre’s analysis, Henry’s continuation of Moïse’s extra-parliamentary authoritarian rule has created such political instability, bloody turf wars and lethal street fights, that businesses are being defeated in their struggles to fulfill orders.</p>\n<p>“The political issue has a very big impact on production in Haiti,” Pierre explained. “We have gangs in control of the street. They decide when people can go to work, or not.” This is especially a problem for workers who live in one district of the city, but who have to pass through another to reach their workplace, he added. “We have two factories in Carrefour but the workers cannot cross Martissant. It’s a problem. There are two other factories in Croix-des-Bouquets where drivers crossing the border were kidnapped while trying to deliver the containers.”</p>\n<p>Factory owners are closing the factories because “business as usual” cannot be conducted, he emphasized, and not because workers are intentionally withholding their labor. Surrounded by ruthless gang and police violence, people are sticking close to their neighborhoods where neighbors know each other, he says. Venturing out of one’s own turf can lead to dangerous confrontations with warring gang members affiliated with various political parties, or just getting caught in the crossfire.</p>\nThe labor law firm blames the proposed massive layoffs on the stranglehold that foreign business interests have on the garment sector.\n<p>“We have a prime minister here, but we don’t have a parliament, and we don’t know exactly who manages this country,” Pierre said. “Maybe that’s one of the reasons why one year after the assassination of Moïse, we’ve never heard a resolution about what actually happened. We’ve heard that the prime minister may be implicated, but the story keeps changing, and we don’t know exactly where these things are left.”</p>\nThose With the Means to Leave Are Exiting in Droves\n<p>Those who can, Pierre says, are selling their possessions to scratch together enough money to secure a visa and $800 or $900 for a ticket to Brazil or Chile “where it’s actually not that much better,” he said. Or they attempt to cross into the Dominican Republic, which has become openly and murderously hostile to Haitian workers. Even Dominican Black people have been slain there recently, because they were mistaken for Haitian nationals.</p>\n<p>Also perilous, Haitians are risking their lives on unsafe voyages on the open sea to the U.S. “In the last couple of months, we saw many boats, and those sailing in them were being arrested on the ocean,” Pierre said. “People cannot afford to live in Haiti. For those who cannot go to another country, they try to find another job.”</p>\n<p>But having been trained on the sewing machines and having devoted their entire working lives to manufacturing apparel, many workers do not possess transferable skills, Pierre said, and have taken to peddling home-produced wares on the street. “You can go everywhere and you can find people trying to do some trade on the street, some little commerce,” he explained. Before the spike in gas prices, some intrepid Haitians, for example, would go to the north to buy fruits unavailable in the west and south, and bring them to the other regions for sale. But options like these are few, and are becoming increasingly foreclosed.</p>\n<p>Even tourism marketed to Haitians living in the diaspora or internal to Haiti is stymied under the circumstances. “Haitians would be very happy to come to eat naturally, to enjoy the nice temperature we have in the country, and the sea, the mountains, and the ecological diversity. But we can’t activate it because of the instability.”</p>\n<p>In Pierre’s assessment, the most important thing, even more important than saving a single sector like the garment sector, which is relatively new in Haiti, is gaining democratic political stability, which means an end to international interference and moving beyond Henry’s continuation of Moïse’s gang-plagued and autocratic governance.</p>\n<p>“The solidarity you find in Haiti is a force of strength,” he said. “If we have political stability, people can live in this country, and even live well.”</p>",

        "link": "https://truthout.org/articles/chomsky-the-us-and-israel-are-standing-in-the-way-of-iran-nuclear-agreement/",
        "description": "<p>During the first few decades of the post-war era, the U.S. considered Iran one of its closest geostrategic allies, especially after the CIA overthrew Iran’s democratically elected government in 1953 and restored Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as Iran’s leader. However, since the 1979 revolution, which abolished the monarchy and established an Islamic republic, the U.S. and Iran have been mortal enemies, largely due to the role that Israel occupies in the region. In this context, during the last couple of decades, the thorniest issue in the U.S.-Iran relationship has been Tehran’s nuclear program, which, Iran says, is focused on energy, not weapons. Israel has been adamantly opposed to the program, even though it is accepted beyond dispute that Israel itself is a nuclear power. In 2015, Iran and several other countries, including the United States, reached the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement, according to which Iran was willing to dismantle much of its nuclear program and open its facilities to nuclear inspections in exchange for billions of dollars of relief support. However, the Trump administration withdrew U.S. support from the agreement — and Israel continued its policy of sabotage and assassination of scientists.</p>\n<p>Current talks between Washington and Tehran’s rulers to restore the 2015 nuclear agreement have been stalled, and there is little hope that progress will be made any time soon. Naturally, the U.S. places the blame on Tehran. However, U.S. propaganda grossly distorts the reality of the situation, Noam Chomsky points out in this exclusive interview for Truthout. The barriers to diplomacy are none other than Israel and the United States, says Chomsky.</p>\n<p>C.J. Polychroniou: Noam, the U.S. and Iran are at odds with each other, having difficulty even talking to each other. Why do they hate each other so much, and how much of a role does Israel’s shadow play in this continuous drama?</p>\n<p>Noam Chomsky: At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I’d like to say a few words, once again, on why I feel that the entire framework in which this issue is discussed is seriously distorted — yet another tribute to the enormous power of the U.S. propaganda system.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government has been telling us for years that Iranian nuclear programs are one of the gravest threats to world peace. Israeli authorities have made it clear that they will not tolerate this danger. The U.S. and Israel have acted violently to overcome this grave threat: cyberwar and sabotage (which the Pentagon regards as aggression that merits violence in self-defense), numerous assassinations of Iranian scientists, constant threats of use of force (“all options are open”) in violation of international law (and if anyone were to care, the U.S. Constitution).</p>\n<p>Evidently, it is regarded as a most serious issue. If so, we surely want to see whether there is some way to lay it to rest. There is: Establish a nuclear weapons-free zone (NWFZ) in the Middle East, with inspections — which, we know, can work very well. Even U.S. intelligence agrees that before the U.S. dismantled the joint agreement on nuclear weapons (JCPOA), international inspections of Iran’s nuclear program were successful.</p>\n<p>That would solve the alleged problem of Iranian nuclear programs, ending the serious threat of war. What then is the barrier?</p>\n<p>Not the Arab states, which have been actively demanding this for decades. Not Iran, which supports the measure. Not the Global South — G-77, 134 “developing nations,” most of the world — which strongly supports it. Not Europe, which has posed no objections.</p>\n<p>The barrier is the usual two outliers: the U.S. and Israel.</p>\n<p>There are various pretexts, which we may ignore. The reasons are known to all: The U.S. will not allow the enormous Israeli nuclear arsenal, the only one in the region, to be subject to international inspection.</p>\n<p>In fact, the U.S. does not officially recognize that Israel has nuclear weapons, though of course it is not in doubt. The reason, presumably, is that to do so would invoke U.S. law, which, arguably, would render the massive U.S. aid flow to Israel illegal — a door that few want to open.</p>\n<p>All of this is virtually undiscussable in the U.S., outside of arms control circles. On rare occasions, the major media have come close to bringing up the forbidden topic. A year ago, New York Times editors proposed “One Way Forward on Iran: A Nuclear-Weapons-Free Persian Gulf.”</p>\n<p>Note: Persian Gulf, not Middle East. The reason, the editors explain, is that Israel’s nuclear weapons are “unacknowledged and nonnegotiable.” Filling in the gaps, they are unacknowledged by the U.S. and are nonnegotiable by U.S. fiat.</p>\n<p>In brief, there is a straightforward approach to addressing this grave threat to world peace, but it is blocked by the global hegemon, whose power is so enormous that the topic can barely even be discussed. Rather, we must adopt the framework imposed by U.S. power and keep to the deliberations over renewing some kind of agreement over Iranian nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p>Another matter that must be sidelined, though it is so obvious that even the grandest propaganda system cannot entirely efface it, is that the current crisis arose when the U.S. unilaterally destroyed the JCPOA, over the strenuous objections of all other signers and the UN Security Council, which had endorsed it unanimously. The U.S. then imposed harsh sanctions on Iran to punish it for the U.S. dismantling of the agreement. Again, other signers strenuously objected, but they obeyed: The threat of U.S. retribution is too awesome, as in many other cases; notoriously the crushing Cuba sanctions, opposed by the whole world apart from the two usual outliers, but obediently observed.</p>\n<p>Again, I apologize for continually reiterating all of this. It must, however, be understood. Having made that gesture, let’s accept reality, subordinating ourselves to the mighty U.S. propaganda system, and keep to the permitted framework of discussion.</p>\n<p>Turning finally to the question, first, Israel’s role is more than shadow play. Israel is right at the center of the story, both in its constant violent attacks on Iran and in the “unacknowledged” nuclear arsenal that blocks to path to diplomatic settlement, thanks to its superpower protector.</p>\n<p>On mutual hate, we should remember that we are talking about governments. The U.S. and Iranian governments were close allies from 1953, when the U.S. overthrew the parliamentary government of Iran and reinstalled the Shah’s dictatorship, until 1979, when a popular uprising overthrew the Shah and Iran switched from favored friend to reviled enemy.</p>\n<p>Iraq then invaded Iran and the incoming Reagan administration turned to lavish support for its friend Saddam. Iran suffered huge casualties, many from chemical weapons while the Reaganites looked away and even tried to shift responsibility to Iran for Saddam’s murderous chemical war against Iraqi Kurds. Finally, direct U.S. intervention swung the war in Iraq’s favor. After the war, President Bush Sr. invited Iraqi nuclear engineers to the U.S. for advanced training in weapons production, a serious threat to Iran of course. And the U.S. imposed harsh sanctions on Iran. So, the story continues.</p>\n<p>U.S. charges against Iran are too familiar to need reviewing. </p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran have stalled again and it is unlikely that there will be a deal any time soon — if at all — to restore their 2015 nuclear deal. First, what do you see as the stumbling blocks in these talks? And didn’t Iran already make a huge concession when it agreed to the 2015 nuclear agreement without requiring that Israel does away with its own arsenal of nuclear weapons?</p>\n<p>Negotiations, through European intermediaries, seem to have been put on hold until after the U.S. November elections, at least. There are outstanding disagreements on a number of issues. The most important, for now, are reported to be Iranian foot-dragging on inspection of traces of uranium that bear on whether Iran had an undeclared weapons program before 2003. In contrast, Israeli nuclear weapons programs are nonnegotiable by U.S. fiat, not even subject to inspection.</p>\n<p>Iran’s relationship with Russia has been further strengthened since the start of the Ukraine war. Do such moves on the part of Tehran’s rulers indicate the possibility of a complete break from the West?</p>\n<p>It’s hard to see how the break should go much farther. Iran’s closer relations with Russia are part of a general global realignment, its contours unclear, involving the major Asian states and Russia-China links.</p>\n<p>How likely is it that Israel will attack Iran’s nuclear facilities?</p>\n<p>Israel has repeatedly attacked these facilities with sabotage and assassination. It is likely to proceed with further efforts to prevent Iran from gaining the capability to produce nuclear weapons — which many countries have.</p>\n<p>Iranian leaders have consistently claimed that they have no intention of producing nuclear weapons. I have no idea what their strategic thinking might be. Perhaps they are thinking along the lines of U.S. nuclear doctrine: that “nuclear weapons must always be available, at the ready, because they ‘cast a shadow over any crisis or conflict’” (Essentials of Post-Cold War Deterrence, STRATCOM 1995). As Daniel Ellsberg has emphasized, in that respect nuclear weapons are constantly used to enable other aggressive actions with impunity.</p>\n<p>Whatever the motives, for Iran or any other state, these weapons must be eliminated from the Earth. NWFZs are a step in this direction. A more far-reaching step is the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), now in force though without the participation of the nuclear states. Iran was active in negotiation of the TPNW and was one of 122 states that voted in favor its adoption, though it has not yet signed it. These are concerns that should be uppermost in our minds, for all states, for the security of all of life on Earth.</p>",

        "link": "https://truthout.org/articles/special-master-tells-trump-lawyers-to-explain-false-planted-evidence-claims/",
        "description": "<p>Judge Raymond Dearie, the special master assigned to investigate whether or not government documents retrieved from Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property last month are privileged, has ordered Trump’s lawyers to explain whether they believe the FBI “planted” evidence during their search of the estate.</p>\n<p>Dearie’s demand was part of a broader order in which he instructed Trump’s lawyers to examine an 11-page inventory of items removed from Mar-a-Lago and indicate which items are privileged or personal property of Trump’s by September 30.</p>\n<p>Since the search of Trump’s property in Palm Beach, Florida, the former president and his allies have repeatedly insinuated that the FBI may have planted evidence in order to incriminate him. </p>\n<p>“Everyone was asked to leave the premises,” Trump said in a Truth Social post two days after the search. “They wanted to be alone without any witnesses to see what they were doing, taking or, hopefully not, ‘planting.'”</p>\n<p>In an interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity this week, Trump continued to suggest that the documents found at Mar-a-Lago may have been planted, but didn’t provide evidence to back up his claims.</p>\n<p>Although Trump’s lawyers haven’t argued that the documents were planted in a courtroom setting, Dearie’s order sought to dispel any misconceptions on the matter.</p>\n<p>“No later than September 30, 2022, Plaintiff [Trump] shall submit a declaration or affidavit that…list[s] any specific items set forth in the Detailed Property Inventory that Plaintiff asserts were not seized from the Premises on August 8, 2022,” part of the order reads.</p>\n<p>“This submission shall be Plaintiff’s final opportunity to raise any factual dispute as to the completeness and accuracy of the Detailed Property Inventory,” Dearie wrote, adding that, for any document Trump’s legal team “designates as privileged and/or personal,” they must “include a brief statement explaining the basis for the designation.”</p>\n<p>This is the second time since Dearie was appointed special master — at the recommendation of Trump’s lawyers — that he has issued an order that was less than ideal for the former president’s legal team.</p>\n<p>During his first hearing on Tuesday, Dearie pressed Trump’s lawyers to explain why they believed that any of the 100 classified documents that were retrieved from Mar-a-Lago could possibly be viewed as declassified, as Trump has publicly claimed numerous times. Although his lawyers haven’t made the same assertions, they have tried to suggest that the Department of Justice (DOJ) shouldn’t automatically view the documents as classified. </p>\n<p>After Trump’s lawyers refused to elaborate on their arguments, Dearie told them that he would side with the DOJ in viewing the documents as classified unless they submitted evidence proving otherwise.</p>\n<p>Dearie’s first few actions since becoming special master have been widely praised by legal experts, who noted that previous rulings by Trump-appointed Florida federal Judge Aileen Cannon granted the former president tremendous leeway. Experts say that the special master is holding Trump and his legal counsel accountable — not only for what they’ve asserted in the courtroom, but also for how they’ve tried to influence the court of public opinion.</p>\n<p>“The power of our courts is they have a way of bringing out truth,” said former federal prosecutor Elie Honig on CNN Thursday. “Perhaps a person can get away with fudging the truth in their public statements, in the media, in their private life, in their business. But when you step into a court, ultimately, the judge or the jury will say, fine, that’s your allegation, now prove it.”</p>\n<p>“Judge Raymond Dearie is trumping Team Trump at every turn,” said Glenn Kirschner, another former federal prosecutor, on Twitter. “It wouldn’t surprise me if they withdrew their request for a special master, because they are damaging their own ability to defend Trump in future prosecutions.” </p>\n<p>“Team Trump is really not very good at this lawyering stuff,” Kirschner added.</p>\n<p>“Judge Dearie and 11th Circuit have put Mar-a-Lago case back on track,” said Barb McQuade, a former U.S. attorney and University of Michigan law professor.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Olson is out of the lineup for the first time this season. </p> <p>As the Atlanta Braves take the field Saturday they will be trying to avoid their first four-game losing streak of the season. While most people will focus on Jake Odorizzi’s poor outing Friday, and to be clear he was bad, it is Atlanta’s offense that needs to get going in the worst way. </p>\n<p>The Braves have scored just one run in the first two games of the series and their only extra-base hit came in Thursday’s 1-0 loss. They are 0-for-10 with runners in scoring position and have left 16 men on base over the the last two days. Outside of Austin Riley, who is 5-for-6 including that double Thursday, the rest of the team is a combined 7-for-58. That isn’t going to cut it against anyone, much less a team like the Phillies who are fighting for their own playoff positioning.</p>\n\n\n<p>Tonight's lineup!#ForTheA pic.twitter.com/pjRy64O7L7</p>— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The Braves will be without Ronald Acuna Jr. for a third straight game. Additionally, they will give slumping Matt Olson his first off day of the season. Austin Riley will start at first base with Orlando Arcia getting the start at third base. </p>\n<p>Rhys Hoskins and Alec Bohm are a combined 8-for-16 in the series with two doubles, a triple and a home run. Hoskins, Bohm, Matt Vierling, J.T. Realmuto and Brandon Marsh all have at least two hits in the series. One player that hasn’t contributed is Bryce Harper who is 0-for-6 with two walks and four strikeouts. </p>\n\n\n<p>Saturday afternoon starters. #RingTheBell<br /><br /> : @NBCSPhilly<br /> : @SportsRadioWIP<br /> : https://t.co/HhDxScbmEV // https://t.co/vgbMhIMsON pic.twitter.com/TB49My5WTU</p>— Philadelphia Phillies (@Phillies) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Saturday’s game will get underway at 4:05 p.m. ET and can be seen on Bally Sports South. </p>",

        "link": "https://jabberwocking.com/slouching-towards-utopia-the-actual-review-itself/",
        "description": "<p>Having written a technical preface a couple of days ago, it's now time to write a review of Brad DeLong's Slouching Towards Utopia. I'd like to keep this tolerably short, but even as I type these words I know that's not in the cards. Don't say you weren't warned.</p>\n<p>OK then. Roughly speaking, I'd say there are two main themes in STU:</p>\n\nThe year 1870 is a breakpoint in human history thanks to the development of globalization, modern corporations, and industrial research labs. Because of these things, it's the first time that the world—or, more precisely, the northern half of the world—broke out of its Malthusian trap and began to provide permanently higher incomes to common workers. (I am skeptical of this for reasons I outlined at length in the preface.)\nThe economic history of the \"long 20th century\" from 1870-2010 was primarily a contest between free-market capitalism, which produced growth but not an equitable distribution of goodies, and the welfare state, which interfered with the efficiency of the market but allowed everyone to benefit from technological progress.\n\n<p>First things first: purely as an economic history, this is a wonderful and engaging book. I didn't learn a lot that I didn't already know, but a large part of that is because I've been reading Brad's stuff for 20 years. Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading it again all in one place.</p>\n<p>But I had a problem with it. I explained in the technical preface that I didn't buy the notion that 1870 was special per se. Rather, it just happened to be the point on the growth curve of the Britain-led Industrial Revolution that produced per capita GDP high enough to start trickling down to everyone.</p>\n<p>Nor did 1870 represent a sudden outbreak of new inventions. Here's a brief list of 19th century inventions and ideas:</p>\n\nHigh-pressure steam engine\nSteamboats\nSteam locomotives\nCanal networks\nTelegraph\nRifle/revolver\nElectric motor/generator/dynamo\nVulcanized rubber\nPortland cement\nColonialism — I'm thinking here not of the necessarily limited coastal version but of the brutal extractive version that dominated the second half of the 19th century.\nModern fractional reserve banking\nSteel-hulled steamships\nMcCormick reaper\nSewing machine\nBessemer process\nLimited liability companies\nSafety elevator/skyscrapers\nProgress — by which I mean the idea that not only should we expect technological progress, we should actively promote it. Manifestations of this are things like patent offices, industrial labs, and research universities.\nInternal combustion engine\nMail order catalogs\nTelephone\nLight bulb\nPublic health improvements\nAutomobile\nAC electricity grid\n\n<p>These things span the entire 19th century. Some are ordinary physical inventions (steamships, light bulbs) while others are ideas or organizational improvements (progress, capitalism). Some have specific invention dates, while others developed steadily over long periods. But nothing about this list suggests any kind of sudden surge around 1870.</p>\n<p>Does this really matter? It does. The whole concept of 1870 being special is surprisingly central to Brad's larger thesis. His contention—and I hope I'm being fair here—is that the miraculous growth which started in 1870 opened up the doors to utopia (thus the title of the book). That is, it suddenly became possible to envision a future in which every one of us was literally awash in the products of our factories and laboratories. All we had to do was follow a simple path that was now clearly marked out for us.</p>\n<p>But we blew it. There was World War I. Then the Great Depression. And World War II. Then the \"Glorious 30 Years\" of fabulous growth, but followed by the neoliberal turn in which ordinary workers were once again cannon fodder for the rich. And all along we failed to include the global south in our growth revolution. Finally, the Great Recession of 2010 exposed our financial system as a lie, and in 2016 the election of Donald Trump showed that ordinary workers were fed up and no longer believed the lie.</p>\n<p>That sounds pretty discouraging. But what if 1870 isn't special? What if it's just another year in a long period of human progress—unprecedented progress, to be sure, but a long, continual period nonetheless? If that's the case, then there's no reason to view it as a turning point and no reason to think that human nature should change just because we all got steadily richer. In other words, we didn't blow it. We just did what h. sapiens does and always has done.</p>\n<p>As Brad knows well, because he's written similar things frequently, we humans are just overclocked primates. We have developed a thin layer of cognition that allows us to gossip more effectively and solve differential equations on request, but that thin layer lives on top of millions of years of primate evolution. And we are still bound by it. In particular:</p>\n<p>We are territorial.<br />\nWe are patriarchal.<br />\nWe are hierarchical.<br />\nWe are addicted to dominance displays.<br />\nWe are tribal.</p>\n<p>So just as always, after 1870 we continued to have stupid wars. We continued to base our social structures on racism and tribalism. We continued to be seduced by charismatic (male) leaders. We continued to do stupid things just to show that we couldn't be pushed around.</p>\n<p>This is, perhaps counterintuitively, a more optimistic view of the world than Brad's. He thinks something should have changed in 1870 and he's disappointed that it didn't happen. His entire book, but especially the last few chapters, is clouded by despondence over the events of the past century and, especially, the past decade.</p>\n<p>I, on the other hand, think that nothing special should have happened just because we got better at inventing things. And it didn't. We just continued on our sloppy way, complete with wars and exploitation and lynchings and occasionally lunatic political parties. Still, we've made progress on all these things. Not a lot, but what do you expect in only a few hundred years?</p>\n<p>This is why, for example, I think that our current MAGA-inflected politics is a pothole, not a roadmap for the future. We'll get over it.</p>\n<p>As for economics in general, you all know what I think: in another 20 or 30 years we will have cheap, genuine artificial intelligence. That will be a breakpoint in human history and will make all our current arguments moot. Practically any economic disagreement you can think of simply makes no sense in a world dominated by robots and AI.</p>\n<p>But we should keep arguing anyway. After all, I might be wrong about AI.</p>\n\nFacebook  \nTwitter \nEmail\nPrint",

(credit: Samuel Axon)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For the past couple of years, Apple’s annual iOS updates have laser focused on one feature for an overhaul while making smaller tweaks to everything else. Last year, Focus was the, well, focus. The year before that, it was the home screen.</p>\n<p>This time it’s the lock screen. You can now change fonts, add widgets, customize the information displayed, and pick from a wider variety of wallpaper. Apple has also more deeply integrated the lock screen with the Focus modes that were fleshed out in iOS 15. And it has laid the groundwork for something more than just notifications that third-party apps can show you before you unlock your phone.</p>\n<p>Given the increasingly iterative nature of iOS releases today—with many key features not arriving until months after the initial ship date of a new, whole-numbered version—we’re moving to leaner initial iOS reviews, with updates to come in additional articles over time. So today we’re going to look at the main new feature of iOS 16, but we’ll touch on a couple of other key features and changes, too.</p><p>Read 68 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

Those words are apocryphally attributed to the Bolshevik revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, referring to the rapid collapse of tsarist Russia just over 100 years ago. If he had actually said those words, Lenin might have added that there are also decades when centuries happen.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The world is in the midst of one such decade. As with other historical hinges, the danger today stems from a sharp decline in world order. But more than at any other recent moment, that decline threatens to become especially steep, owing to a confluence of old and new threats that have begun to intersect at a moment the United States is ill positioned to contend with them.”</p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/3659664-we-need-resilient-health-systems-to-address-the-dual-crisis-of-infectious-and-chronic-diseases/",
        "description": "<p>With our health systems strained by the concurrent outbreaks of monkeypox, polio and COVID-19, chronic diseases are not receiving the attention they deserve. But as we continue to face ongoing infectious disease threats, we need to build resilient health systems that are equipped to face both public health emergencies and ongoing population health challenges.                                    </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pre-pandemic, chronic disease was already a serious problem in the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in six adults has a chronic disease, and four in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases. These include diabetes, heart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease. Chronic diseases represent seven of the top 10 causes of death in the United States.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has starkly affected chronic disease directly and indirectly through disruption to preventive care and disease management and by contributing to high morbidity and mortality rates. Heart disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease and obesity are all conditions that increase the risk for severe illness from COVID. We have also witnessed the birth of new chronic disease in “long COVID,” which affects nearly one in five Americans.            </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A growing number of studies has shown that COVID can increase a person’s risk of diabetes, even months after infection. A Lancet study found that people who were infected with COVID were about 40 percent more likely to develop diabetes up to a year later than others in the control groups. For every 1,000 people studied in each group, roughly 13 more individuals in the COVID group were diagnosed with diabetes. Even people who had mild infections and no previous risk factors for diabetes had increased odds of developing the chronic condition.     </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several studies have also highlighted how the pandemic has created a barrier to preventive cancer care. A 2021 study published on the pandemic’s impact on cancer services in Louisiana and Georgia found there were nearly 30,000 fewer cancer pathology reports than in 2019, representing a 10 percent decline. Many reported delaying or missing preventive care appointments due to fear of exposure to the virus in 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without responding to the dual crisis of infectious disease threats like COVID and chronic disease, each will continue to amplify the negative effect of the other. This will only put further strain on our health systems, ultimately creating barriers or reduced care capacity for other health care issues.                </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our health care system needs to align incentives to encourage payers, providers, employers and individuals to better prevent, detect, treat and manage chronic diseases before they become acute, costly problems. This begins with increasing access and removing barriers to primary care doctors and complete integrated preventive care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Primary care doctors are critical to helping patients prevent and navigate chronic disease and providing referrals to other specialists who can assist with their conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll, one-fourth of adults and nearly half of adults under 30 don’t have a primary care doctor. This care disparity is worse for minorities. A 2020 poll by the African American Research Collection found that Black, Native and Latino Americans reported having less access to a primary care doctor than their white counterparts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One positive impact of the pandemic has been the uptake of telemedicine, particularly for those in rural areas or health care “deserts.” New technological advances can also expand the role that telemedicine plays in at-home care delivery. Remote patient-monitoring devices allow providers to monitor patient progress remotely and receive alerts if there is an issue. To continue to reap the benefits of telemedicine, we need to make the emergency authorizations permanent and ensure payment parity for providers. Equitable access to the internet for all Americans is also necessary to reduce care disparities.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standardized, interoperable health care data systems will also help providers reduce inefficiencies and improve the health system’s ability to proactively identify risk and coordinate care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By investing in emerging technology tools such as big data analytics and genomic testing, providers can conduct early outreach and consistently follow-up, monitor and manage patients more effectively in their homes, while cultivating a deeper understanding of how, why and where chronic diseases develop.          </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By investing in resilient health systems to address public health emergencies and chronic disease, we can encourage healthy longevity for all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. William Haseltine is president of ACCESS Health International and will be moderating two expert panels at the Metabesity 2022 conference on how lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic can prepare us to address the ongoing epidemic of chronic diseases.  </p>",

        "description": "<p>Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) slammed House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Friday over his “Commitment to America” plan, saying that it was “an opportunity squandered” by his choice to “bow” to the \"MAGA” wing of the GOP for his political gain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Kevin McCarthy, who is supposed to be the leader of the Republican Party, is instead being led by a conspiracy theorist masquerading as a member of Congress,” Kinzinger said in a video posted on his Twitter page, referencing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), with whom McCarthy introduced the plan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarthy unveiled the plan outlining Republicans’ top initiatives Thursday as they attempt to regain the majority in both houses of Congress in the upcoming November elections. The four pillars of the plan are an “economy that’s strong,” a “nation that’s safe,” a “future based on freedom” and a “government that’s accountable.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kinzinger said McCarthy is “outright supporting” the conspiracy theories that pose a threat to American democracy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s cowardly and disgusting,” he said. “Republicans deserve better, Americans deserve better than a party that insists on pandering to this nonsense.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kinzinger said Greene has “regurgitated” Russian propaganda that has been used to justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by calling Ukrainians “Nazis.” He said Russia is the only country responsible for the war. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that Greene has attacked anyone who does not “think, look or act” like her. He said Greene has called on members of Congress to go “back to the Middle East” because she disagrees with their political beliefs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kinzinger said McCarthy condemned this type of behavior “just a few years ago” while Greene was running for office. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said “today is a profoundly sad moment” for the Republican Party, but these types of moments are becoming too common. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarthy’s Commitment to America is inspired by the 1994 \"Contract with America,\" created at the time by soon-to-be House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) as part of a plan for Republicans to retake control of Congress. The 1994 midterm elections saw a major victory for Republicans in which the party took control of both houses of Congress.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The White Sox have announced that Tony La Russa, who has been absent from the team due to a medical issue, will not return to manage for the remainder of the 2022 season. “After undergoing additional testing and medical procedures over the past week, doctors for Tony La Russa have directed him to no return as manager of the Chicago White Sox for the remainder of the 2022 season,” a team statement reads. “Bench coach Miguel Cairo will continue to serve as acting White Sox manager through the remainder of the 2022 season.”</p>\n<p>La Russa, who turns 78 next month, took a leave of absence from the club at the end of August. The exact nature of his medical ailment wasn’t specified at the time, though it was reported that he would undergo testing on his heart. He was cleared to travel to Oakland a couple of weeks ago for a ceremony honoring Dave Stewart, though not to return to any kind of active duty in the dugout. It seems that, in the opinions of his medical team, La Russa hasn’t recovered enough to return to the team over the final days of the season.</p>\n<p>La Russa’s contract runs through 2023, though his ability to actually serve as the club’s skipper next year could depend on how he recuperates. Cairo has been at the helm the past few weeks and will continue in that role down the stretch. Though the White Sox initially surged under his leadership, they have cooled off recently. They are now eight games behind the Guardians in the Central division and 6.5 games out of a Wild Card spot.</p>",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/mariners-luis-castillo-agree-to-extension.html",
        "description": "<p>Luis Castillo has gone from trade deadline prize to franchise cornerstone, as the right-hander has signed a five-year, $108MM extension with the Mariners. The deal could be worth up to $133MM based on a vesting option for the 2028 season, and that option vests if Castillo throws at least 180 innings in 2027. The Mariners can also receive a $5MM club option Castillo’s services for 2028 should he miss more than 130 days in 2025-27 due to a UCL repair procedure. Castillo will also receive a full no-trade clause for the extension’s first three seasons.</p>\n<p>Castillo was slated to become a free agent after the 2023 season, but the Republik Sports client will instead stick with the Mariners for at least four years beyond that original date. The Mariners’ official announcement of the extension included statements from both Castillo and president of baseball operations Jerry Dipoto.</p>\n<p>“Luis has been one of the top pitchers in MLB over the past six seasons,” Dipoto said. “He is a dynamic power pitcher in the prime of his career with a track record of consistency. Bringing him to Seattle represented a key moment in our ongoing efforts to build a championship roster. Similarly, this deal illustrates our continued commitment to both the present and future of this team.”</p>\n<p>“I feel great,” Castillo said. “Every baseball player wants to have a dream like this become a reality. I’m happy I was able to accomplish this with the Mariners and I want to thank everybody in the organization for treating me so well.”</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Castillo, 29, began his major league career with the Reds, establishing himself as an excellent starting pitcher. From his 2017 debut through 2021, he made 123 starts and pitched to an ERA of 3.72. That mark is all the more impressive given the hitter-friendly nature of Great American Ball Park, with both Statcast and ESPN ranking it second behind Coors Field in that department. He was able to attain that level of success by getting ground balls on 53.9% of batted balls while striking out 26.2% of hitters faced, both of those numbers being much better than league average. He also displayed adequate control, walking 8.8% of hitters who came to the plate, a mark that’s roughly league average. He produced 14.5 wins above replacement in that time, according to FanGraphs, a mark that ranks among the top 20 among all pitchers in the league.</p>\n<p>The most recent offseason got off to an ominous start for the Reds, as general manager Nick Krall said that the club “must align our payroll to our resources and continue focusing on scouting and developing young talent from within our system” in the wake of Tucker Barnhart’s trade to the Tigers. Trade rumors immediately began swirling around Castillo, along with his rotation mates Sonny Gray and Tyler Mahle. Gray would be dealt to Minnesota in March but the Reds hung onto Mahle and Castillo to start the year. Castillo was slowed by some shoulder soreness early in camp but returned to the mound in May and didn’t show any rust when retaking the hill. Through 14 starts with Cincy, he had an ERA of 2.86 along with a 47.1% ground ball rate, 25.8% strikeout rate and 8% walk rate.</p>\n<p>Despite Castillo’s contributions, the Reds unsurprisingly got poor results overall with their ongoing selloff. Castillo was once again the focus of trade rumors as the deadline approached, with the Padres, Twins, Mets, Yankees, Blue Jays, Dodgers, Cardinals and Astros among those showing interest. Ultimately, the Mariners won the bidding by sending prospects Noelvi Marte, Edwin Arroyo, Levi Stoudt and Andrew Moore to Cincinnati. Since the trade, Castillo has continued his excellent season by making another nine starts with a 2.83 ERA, 29.1% strikeout rate, 5.9% walk rate and 46% ground ball rate. It seems the M’s got exactly what they wanted out of Castillo and locked him up long-term.</p>\n<p>The price point is something of a surprise, given the most recent comparison is probably José Berríos. After being acquired by Blue Jays last year, Berríos was heading into his final year before free agency but agreed to a seven-year, $131MM extension. Berríos is having a terrible year here in 2022 but was actually on pretty similar footing to Castillo when he signed that deal. From 2017 to 2021, Berríos produced 15.2 fWAR, the same stretch that saw Castillo produce 14.5. Castillo has agreed to delay his free agency in exchange for less money and fewer years, though a higher average annual value. Berríos’ deal comes with an AAV of $18.7 whereas Castillo’s is $21.6MM, though if he vests the option it would take it up to $22.17MM.</p>\n<p>For the Mariners, it’s still a significant investment in a starting pitcher, their second in the past year. They signed Robbie Ray to a five-year, $115MM deal back in November. Those two will now continue forming a core in the rotation for at least the next four seasons after this one. Logan Gilbert, whom the club drafted and developed, isn’t slated to reach free agency until after the 2027 season. George Kirby is one year behind Gilbert and should be around through the 2028 campaign, giving the M’s a core four that can anchor the rotation for quite some time. There’s also Marco Gonzales, whose contract runs through 2024 with a club option for 2025. The club is so awash in starting pitching that Chris Flexen, who triggered a vesting option for 2023, has been bumped to bullpen duty despite a 3.69 ERA on the season.</p>\n<p>The Mariners haven’t made the postseason since 2001, the largest active playoff drought in the majors. They are well-positioned to snap that streak here in 2022, currently holding down the final American League Wild Card spot with a three-game cushion over the Orioles. With their rotation seemingly set for years to come and a position player core that includes Julio Rodriguez, J.P. Crawford, Eugenio Suarez and others, they should continue competing into the future as well.</p>\n<p>ESPN’s Jeff Passan (Twitter links) was the first to report about Castillo’s extension, and the clause related to the UCL injury. Daniel Kramer of MLB.com reported the 180-inning threshold for the vesting option, and The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal reported the details of Castillo’s no-trade protection.</p>\n<p>Image courtesy of USA Today Sports.</p>",

One last prompt to decide who will face off against Jack in the Playoffs for the coveted PYW’s trophy! But before we can get there, we need to finish setting the stage by looking at the results of last week. I asked you what the Diamondbacks’ plans were for the offseason, which was fitting, as they are now officially eliminated from post season contention as of earlier this week. Very sad, even if it was entirely predictable. In third place, we find SpencerSpice with three recs!</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>In all seriousness, how is this not part of the All Star Week? I’d rather watch that than a celebrity softball game.</p>\n<p>In second place, Heath Klein has four recs and our first red comment of the week!</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>Alt text</p>\n<p>All teams that make the postseason will be entered into a tournament using an advanced copy of the newest “MLB: The Show”, where they’re permitted to trade for any one player from another team for the entirety of that Postseason (where lower ranked teams get the earliest picks).</p>\n<p>The catch being that each pitcher must pitch as themselves and each hitter must hit as themselves, with split screens on the broadcast to show the actual gameplay and the players’ reactions in the clubhouse (including appearances from the tradees).</p>\n<p>No censorship, but a counter that functions as a swear jar with each slip of the tongue (including curses in other languages) leading to donations to a cause voted on by the fans of the World Series winning team.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the A’s are now World Series favorites, due to owning the MLB rights to Kyler Murray, and Deandre Ayton is now the most sought after MLB free agent in the world...</p>\n<p>Anyway, in first place we find a five rec entry from Xerostomia!</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>The top third of the standings stay stationary this week, with no contestants ranked higher than 6th placing on the podium this week. That means, going into the final prompt, Nik has a six rec lead over the next elligible contestant, gzimmerm. Not insurmountable by any stretch! But the odds do heavily favor Nik on this one. </p>\n\n<p>Let’s use our final prompt to say goodbye to a legend. Friday evening, Albert Pujols joined one of the most exclusive clubs in sports by hitting his 700th home run. How should the Cardinals honor and celebrate that achievement? Go!</p>",

        "link": "https://blogs.harvard.edu/trunk/2022/09/24/on-infrastructure/",
        "description": "<p></p>\n<p>MEGO in journalism stands for My Eyes (or Ears) Glaze Over. According to William Safire , a MEGO os “a subject of great importance which resists reader interest.”</p>\n<p>Infrastructure is a one-word MEGO.</p>\n<p>So I haven’t written much about infrastructure, including here: a blog created by Christain Sandvig when we were both fellows at the Berkman Klein Center. It was meant as a place where learned folk who care about infrastructure could hold forth. A variety of those was recruited to participate, and approximately none did. I’ve kept it alive in recent years by posting here occasionally, mostly with stuff that I think fits better here than anywhere else I tend to write.</p>\n<p>In the meantime I have also kept a more active site on the topic going: a Flickr account with the name Infrastructure.  My chief interest there is in the plasticity of infrastructure: how it changes over time, requiring updates and replacements. I am especially interested in forms of infrastructure that are out of sight, mind, or booth, but on which we depend completely. These include water, gas, electric and waste facilities, and—especially—broadcasting.</p>\n<p>In a New Yorker essay explaining why he is compelled to pick up lost golf balls wherever he finds them, John McPhee says, “Compulsions are easy to come by and hard to explain.” I have a similar one: to take pictures of transmitter sites. I came by it as a kid growing up in New Jersey. There my bedroom had a view toward the Manhattan Skyline across swamps populated by dozens of transmitting towers for New York’s many AM  radio stations. I would ride my bike down Route 17 (dangerous and dumb, but I’m still here) to WABC in Lodi and WINS in Lyndhurst, and WADO, WBNX, and WHN on Patterson Plank Road in Rutherford and Carlstadt, just to gawk at the towers and sometimes to knock on doors and ask questions of engineers stationed in buildings feeding signals to the towers. Later, once I could drive, I visited WMCA on Belleville Pike and countless others. Since then I’ve photographed all of these, plus many more, from airplanes, and posted them online.</p>\n<p>I became obsessed with shooting towers and antennas of broadcast stations once digital photography became easy, along with publishing details about them. (One of the most active groups on Facebook is titled, no kidding, “I take pictures of transmitter sites.” It has over fourteen thousand members, most of which, I gather, are active or retired engineers like the ones I would visit as a kid.)</p>\n<p>More recently I have come to realize that radio as a broadcast medium is being eaten on the music side by streaming (Apple, Amazon, Spotify, Pandora) and on the talk side by podcasting. While it will remain useful as long as cars still have radios, the writing is on the wall we call the Internet, which is also eating every other medium you can name, including photography itself.</p>\n<p>So now my transmitter site photography has a documentary purpose: keeping up with what’s going down.</p>\n<p>The example at the top tells the story of one tower transmitting three of Santa Barbara’s AM stations. Here’s what the tower looked like for most of its life, when it was 198 feet tall and proclaiming itself a landmark with bright red and white paint. And here’s what it looks like since December of last year, at just 128 feet tall, painted dark green to camouflage it among surrounding palm and eucalyptus trees.</p>\n<p>This tower was lucky. AM stations across the country are going dark or operating from diminished facilities because listening is declining while land under many towers is worth more than the stations using them. In this case, the tower stands in the city equipment yard, taking up almost no room on the ground, and the shorter tower works almost as well as it did at full height. But it’s an example of a ratcheting down of importance.</p>\n<p>Had this been 20 or more years ago, the tower, which was slightly bent, would have been replaced or straightened. The new configuration is also interesting for engineering reasons. Twelve-foot-long “whiskers” attached to the top of the sawed-off tower increase its height electrically without doing so physically. Listeners, I am sure, can tell no difference. Nor did they notice when WBBM/780, Chicago’s alpha news station, dropped from 50,000 watts to 35,000 watts in the daytime and 44,000 watts at night, from the tower of sister station WSCR/670. The station’s owner made that move so it could sell the land under WBBM’s old tower.</p>\n<p>Among the deceased:</p>\n\nWMEX/1510’s 50,000-watt facility\nThe old master antenna for nearly all of New York’s FM stations\nMore I’ll list when I get the time\n\n<p>Those are harbingers toward a time when AM is gone completely, as it already is in much of Europe. FM and TV are not far behind. But streams will remain, as the most popular radio already is the smartphone.</p>\n<p>And I want to document as much of the change as I can.</p>\n<p>By the way, I am also firing up this blog because it is also starting to show up in some RSS feeds. Greetings, feedsters!</p>\n<p>Important: RSS is hugely important infrastructure. Dig:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nothing with that many results can’t matter.</p>",

        "description": "<p>It didn't take long after New York Attorney General Letitia James announced her $250 million fraud lawsuit against the Trump Organization for Twitter's toy cannon brigade to strap into their Aerons, crack their knuckles, and start issuing proclamations that the walls around the 45th president were finally closing in.</p>\n<p>\"The noose is tightening on Trump,\" American Enterprise Institute emeritus scholar and D.C. think tank lifer Norman Ornstein exulted: \"Decades of grifting, corruption, rank criminality coming to an end.\" Mueller-investigation attorney turned MSNBC contributor Andrew Weissmann seconded the thought: \"that sucking sound you hear is [the Trump Organization] circling the drain.\"</p>\n<p>It is a perennial consternation to the Resistance Twitter set that Donald Trump's decades-long career as a snake-oil salesman has never managed to derail his political ambitions. \"If Donald Trump committed these offenses against the law for decades,\" historian and Biden-whisperer Michael Beschloss said on MSNBC, \"how is it that our political system allowed him to be elected president?\" If only the rubes knew they were being had!</p>\n<p>The imputation of false consciousness, and the almost touchingly naïve hope that today's new outrage will be the one to finally break the spell, lacks a crucial piece of analytical self-awareness. Trump's critics are absolutely right to see the ex-president's grift. But they fail to recognize the universality in both the American political system and human nature itself when it comes to people willing to fork over money and affection to obvious blowhards and crooks as long as the recipients have the right enemies. The grift is happening across the street, yes—but it's also coming from inside the house.</p>\n<p>Take Letitia James. The ink wasn't yet dry on her quarter-billion-dollar civil lawsuit when the ambitious prosecutor—who once tried running for New York governor for a hot minute—sent out a sleazy fundraising email bragging, \"Guess who's in the headlines again?\"</p>\n<p>\"Once again, powerful and corrupt men have taken over the headlines, friend,\" the appeal continued, likely referencing James's contentious role in chasing former Gov. Andrew Cuomo out of office by investigating allegations of sexual harassment. \"But I'm not surprised. Ever since I took my oath as your attorney general and swore to do everything in my power to finally bring the most corrupt actors to justice, they have worked tirelessly to take me down.\" (Self-impressed italics in the original.)</p>\n<p>Like so much political excreta, Tish's monetization of her ostensibly impartial justice-seeking was gross, legal, and probably inevitable. The attorney general is an elected position, James is a career politician in a deep-blue city and state, and nothing excites her base of support more than the prospects of at long last harpooning the orange whale.</p>\n<p>Fervent consumer-side political passion—the more negative, the better—is the raw material of huckster fortunes: in politics, in media, in publishing, in advertising, in think-tanking, in lobbying, in consulting. And most vaporwarish of all, in headline-chasing overnight nonprofits, preferably attached either to quasi-celebrities or to a celebrated cause (or both).</p>\n<p>Such was Steve Bannon's probably illegal We Build the Wall campaign. Hatched by Iraq War vet Brian Kolfage as a GoFundMe project in December 2018 after Trump and Congress had come to a noisy impasse over paying for the president's signature campaign promise, the stunt raised $9 million in three days; Bannon and anti-immigration clown Kris Kobach quickly joined it. By 2020, the group—which pledged to spend 100 percent of its donations on construction—had raised $25 million, paid themselves very handsomely, and built very little border fencing.</p>\n<p>Kolfage and a second partner pled guilty to fraud and other charges in April 2022. (\"I knowingly and willfully conspired to unlawfully receive money from the donations…I knew what I was doing was wrong and a crime,\" Kolfage told the presiding judge.) A trial against a third partner ended in a hung jury this June. Bannon initially escaped federal prosecution through a pre-emptive last-minute pardon from Trump, but earlier this month the state of New York indicted him on counts of conspiracy, fraud, and money laundering. Said politician Letitia James at the corresponding press conference: \"Regular, everyday Americans play by these rules, and yet too often powerful political interests, they ignore these rules….They think they are above the law, and the most egregious of them take advantage.\"</p>\n<p>To the bewilderment of the federal judge, grassroots donors kept on sending money to the border-wall project long after the initial August 2020 indictment. Bannon's luster in MAGA World has remained largely undimmed, even after literally being arrested on a $35 million yacht. The New York Times' coverage of the state prosecution suggested that this lucrative fundraising sector and seeming lack of consequence for mismanagement was uniquely Trumpy:</p>\n<p>Capitalizing on a president's popularity to make or raise money is nothing new—nor partisan. Neither are accusations of moneymaking in politics. But with several endeavors launched by those in Mr. Trump's orbit, prosecutors have argued that donations were not put to their purported use and instead enriched the organizers.</p>\n<p>A federal grand jury is investigating the formation, fund-raising and spending of a political action committee created by Mr. Trump, which raised millions of dollars to support his efforts to contest the results of the 2020 election.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the attorney general in Washington, D.C., said Mr. Trump's inaugural committee and business would pay $750,000 to resolve a lawsuit claiming the Trump Organization misused nonprofit funds intended for the 2017 inauguration. The lawsuit, originally filed in 2020, said inaugural organizers had used the money raised from donors, intended for inaugural events, to enrich the Trump family.</p>\n<p>In at least one other case, donors themselves have cried foul—as in the operation set up by Mr. Trump's 2020 election campaign, in which supporters unknowingly opted into making recurring online donations.</p>\n<p>While it is probable, given his superlative qualities, that Trump et al have exceeded prior levels of brazen scuzzbucketry, the market for ideological pocket-stuffing exists everywhere there are people ready to express their political emotions by mashing the \"donate\" button.</p>\n<p>In the racially supercharged year of 2020, perhaps no political slogan had such potency and ubiquity as \"Black Lives Matter.\" People outraged by the killing of George Floyd and the attendant racial and policing issues could signal their solidarity by marching in protests, placing signs in their windows and yards, or donating online to groups with that slogan in their name.</p>\n<p>So it was that the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation (BLMGNF) raised a staggering $90 million in 2020 alone. The organization's leaders promptly spent the money on such items as a secretly purchased $6 million mansion in the Hollywood Hills. Now the leadership is in disarray over allegations of gross mismanagement.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Black Lives Matter Grassroots, a sub-organization of BLMGNF, sued the parent group's Shalomyah Bowers for allegedly \"siphoning\" $10 million of donations to create his own \"personal piggy bank,\" and through fiduciary irresponsibility exposing the entire organization to multiple investigations by state and federal tax officials.</p>\n<p>\"This is the case of a rogue administrator, a middleman, turned usurper, who was hired to collect donations and account for expenditures of the Black Lives Matter movement\" and caused \"a path of irreparable harm to BLM in less than eighteen months,\" the lawsuit alleges.</p>\n<p>No doubt there are some individual donors miffed that their generosity helped finance the lavish lifestyles of a few chosen insiders without otherwise delivering many results. But as with the wall project, BLMGNF was the biggest and most obvious receptacle for expressive giving at a specific and particularly emotional moment in time. The end product was not necessarily specific criminal justice reforms, or even the completion of a border wall project that was right there in the name, but rather in the act of giving itself.</p>\n<p>Kat Rosenfield, in a perceptive and perhaps cynical Unherd essay this May, reflected on the \"utter incuriosity\" among wealthy progressive BLM donors about how their money was misspent, concluding: \"But of course, there was no outrage. Those donations were indulgences: a tax-deductible expense after which you, the giver, were free to keep living your privileged life. Whether the money did anything to help was immaterial. The point was to give, and to be able to say you gave.\"</p>\n<p>Political hucksters with their hands caught in the cookie jar benefit not only from donor indifference, but from the willingness of political tribalists to believe that any alleged misconduct on their own side is just proof of further malfeasance from The Man.</p>\n<p>\"They will never shut me up. They'll have to kill me first,\" Steve Bannon vowed when being indicted this month. And the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation responded to this month's lawsuit by insisting that it has been \"consistent and truthful—even in the face of right wing media attacks that have created doubt and distrust among the Black communities we aim to protect and support,\" It added: \"We will not be quiet or idle while lies are spread about our work and our integrity….[W]hite supremacy is the winner when movement leaders take the approach of publicly 'calling out' comrades instead of 'calling-in.'\"</p>\n<p>All the conspiracy theorizing in the world won't help you in a court of law, of course. That's a lesson Donald Trump would have learned a long time ago, if he was the learnin' type. But in a populist moment of deep and abiding negative political polarization, the court of public opinion is still credulous enough to at least pay for the man's legal bills from here to eternity, and keep him in the good graces of the Republican electorate.</p>\n<p>The same is largely true, albeit at different magnitudes, for Trump's tormentors.</p>\n<p>The Lincoln Project, that group of current and former GOP political consultants and dirty tricksters turned #NeverTrump troll artists, keeps raking in the lefty bucks no matter how many sexual harassment scandals, fake-white-supremacist stunts, and dodgy payouts to disgruntled founders the organization racks up. This month, in one of those episodes that will only perpetuate the long, stupid moment we're in, the Project unveiled this ad:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Every dollar you sent him paid to keep his shady business empire and lavish lifestyle going,\" said the group, whose lavish self-dealing has been heavily reported. Judged Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler: \"we could not find any evidence to support [that] statement.\"</p>\n<p>No matter: The Lincoln Project got the media attention it craves, Trump threatened to sue, and no doubt both sides will have ample money available to pay for any legal bills and the continued maintenance of their lifestyles. The battle for our democracy is just too important to stay on the sidelines, friends. We need your donations today.</p>\n<p>The post Why the Political Grift Won't Stop appeared first on Reason.com.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Nuclear energy production is “unlikely” to be part of the next package of EU sanctions against the Kremlin for its invasion of Ukraine, while work on an oil-price cap is continuing, according to several diplomats briefed on the discussions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The European Commission on Saturday organized meetings with top diplomats to listen to the proposals of EU member states before drafting the next package of measures against Moscow, which is expected to be presented next week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Annexation referendums being held in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, which the G7 described as a “sham” on Friday, and the recent discovery of a mass grave in Izyum with more than 400 bodies have convinced many doves among EU member states that new measures have to be introduced. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the diplomats said nuclear power is “unlikely” to be part of the package, even though Poland and the Baltic countries worked for the first time on a joint proposal for new sanctions that also included targeting Russia’s nuclear industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not that easy for the EU to include nuclear energy, which is a key sector in France, and also in Bulgaria, which exports energy to the Western Balkans and Greece. A ban is seen as problematic especially because of the issues that it could cause in terms of maintenance of the nuclear plants built in Bulgaria during the Communist era.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, a key factor in the new urge for more sanctions is pressure from the the U.S. to have a price-capping mechanism on Russian oil exports, as agreed by the G7 countries, in place by December 5, when EU sanctions banning seaborne imports of Russian crude come into force, according to diplomats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Americans stress that companies need a 90-day advance notice for the price cap to be introduced, and we are already late,” said one of the diplomats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s some resistance to an oil-price cap, especially among Mediterranean islands like Cyprus, according to some of the diplomats, but they expect it will be part of the package in the end, although it’s likely it could be finalized only at a meeting of EU leaders in Prague at the start of next month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Commission got the message that the oil-price cap is important to many countries,” said a second diplomat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other diplomats stressed that the price level itself still has to be worked out and more time is needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to two of the diplomats the new package of sanctions is expected to include new import controls on diamonds, semi-finished steel products, machinery and chemicals. In addition, it is expected to include further tightening of export controls on electronic components and some new individual sanctions, this time on individuals involved in the referendums. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A group of countries including the Netherlands is also suggesting a new listing criterion in which assisting with sanctions evasion and circumvention would be grounds for sanctioning individuals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Sanctions implementation is in many cases one of the key problems for us,” stressed one of the diplomats.   </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This article is part of POLITICO Pro</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The one-stop-shop solution for policy professionals fusing the depth of POLITICO journalism with the power of technology</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Exclusive, breaking scoops and insights</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Customized policy intelligence platform</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A high-level public affairs network</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY GO PRO\n\n\n\nLOG IN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3659595-unanimous-decision-making-is-essential-for-preserving-the-supreme-courts-legitimacy/",
        "description": "<p>After the Supreme Court’s draft opinion rejecting a right to abortion was leaked, public confidence in the Court dropped to its lowest level in the past 50 years. And with additional controversial decisions on guns and climate change, concerns about the court's legitimacy have increased. To more and more people, the justices operate as political partisans rather than neutral arbiters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Chief Justice John Roberts has argued that disagreement with the justices' decisions should not undermine the Court's legitimacy, he needs to do more. As he contemplates the harm to the Court’s standing, Roberts would do well to follow the example of one of his most influential predecessors, Chief Justice John Marshall. Marshall came to the court in 1801 at another time when the court’s legitimacy was at an ebb. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During its initial years, the court had followed the British practice of each justice writing a separate opinion. But that approach made it difficult for lawyers, lower court judges, and the public to know what the court actually held. As University of Chicago Law School Professor M. Todd Henderson has written, this resulted in “a weak and divided Court unable to assert any real authority.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chief Justice Marshall instituted a policy of a single opinion for the court, so the justices could speak with a unified voice. In Marshall’s first four years as chief, all of the court’s opinions were issued for the Court as a whole, with one concurring opinion and no dissenting opinions. During this important period, the court decided Marbury v. Madison, establishing judicial supremacy on the interpretation of the Constitution. The court's norm of consensus lasted until 1941, and over the 140 years, the court decided more than 90 percent of its cases unanimously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reviving the practice of unanimous decisions—and requiring it for all cases—would do much to restore the court’s legitimacy. When national policy on critical issues like abortion, gun control, and climate change can be decided by a court majority, the losing side can easily feel that the decisions are based on ideology rather than legal principle. That is an important reason why the court has in the past favored consensus decisions. Perhaps the most famous example occurred in Brown v. Board of Education of Topekawhen the Court held that segregated schools violated the Equal Protection Clause by a 9-0 vote. While the Court could have decided the case with a 6-3 majority, the justices recognized the importance of unanimity in landmark cases and therefore scheduled a reargument of the case to secure the support of all nine justices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not surprising that unanimous decisions would enhance a court’s legitimacy. The example of the jury is illustrative. When judicial decisions are made by juries, the Supreme Court has generally required consensus. The justices have required unanimous jury decisions in federal and state criminal cases, and they also have required juror unanimity in federal civil cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In requiring unanimous juries, the court has identified a few key considerations that reinforce judicial legitimacy. We should have a fair cross-section of the community participate in the decision-making process, and the members of the jury should reach a consensus decision after careful deliberation. These considerations also apply to decisions by the Supreme Court. It is important to have justices with a range of backgrounds and ideological perspectives who reach a consensus decision after careful deliberation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people with different perspectives come together for a thoughtful and reasoned exchange of ideas and arguments, they become more aware of the strengths and weaknesses of the opinions of others, as well as of their own views. As a result, they make better decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Empirical studies of decision making come to the same conclusion. When people with different perspectives make decisions together, they can identify solutions that none of them acting alone would have recognized. Their different ideas can combine to identify new approaches. Thus, rather than merely splitting their differences, they can discover win-win outcomes that make for better overall results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And unanimous decisions are fairer decisions. Because the Supreme Court’s decisions reflect the philosophical leanings of the justices, and decisions can be determined by a majority on one side of the ideological spectrum, our judicial system denies an impartial hearing to parties on the other side of the ideological spectrum. That is fundamentally unfair in a constitutional system that promises litigants a neutral judicial process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the Brownschool integration decision indicates, a unanimous court will still issue pathbreaking decisions. The court also voted unanimously when it struck down bans on interracial marriage in Loving v. Virginia, recognized the right to counsel for criminal defendants in Gideon v. Wainwright, and limited presidential executive privilege in United States v. Nixon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need not worry about gridlock from a requirement of unanimity. As mentioned, the Supreme Court decided cases unanimously more than 90 percent of the time under its norm of consensus, even when not required to do so, and European high courts function effectively today under a norm of consensus. This experience reflects the fact that there always will be common ground on which the majority and minority can settle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, the court has an obligation to resolve critical legal questions, and we can expect justices to fulfill the duties of their position. As Justice Elena Kagan observed when the court had a 4-4 ideological split between the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and the appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2016-17, the justices had a greater need to find common ground, and they worked harder to do so. The justices also would have a strong personal incentive to find common ground under a requirement of unanimity—their desire to leave an important judicial legacy. Coming to consensus would allow them to make a difference in resolving major legal questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Supreme Court’s practice of deciding cases by majority vote may seem natural, it lacks grounding in legal principle or empirical value. With unanimous decision-making, the Supreme Court would reach better decisions and do so in an impartial way. And that is essential for preserving the court’s legitimacy when it decides critical issues like reproductive rights, public safety, and climate change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Orentlicher, MD, JD, is Judge Jack and Lulu Lehman Professor and director of the UNLV Health Law Program.</p>",

        "description": "<p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk announced on Friday that he is activating the company's Starlink satellite internet service in Iran after U.S. officials eased sanctions to allow the Iranian people greater access to the internet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Treasury Department announced the policy change earlier on Friday to let companies provide additional online services as the Iranian government has cut off internet access for most of the country as protests continue nationwide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musk previously announced on Monday that he planned to request permission for Starlink to operate in Iran after the Treasury said it would welcome applications to support internet freedom in the country. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We took action today to advance Internet freedom and the free flow of information for the Iranian people, issuing a General License to provide them greater access to digital communications to counter the Iranian government’s censorship,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a tweet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starlink, a division of the Musk-owned spacecraft manufacturer SpaceX, has operated since 2019, The Associated Press reported. It operates thousands of satellites internationally to provide internet access. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iran has sought to cut off civilians’ access to the internet amid protests that began this past week following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody. Amini was arrested by the morality police for allegedly wearing a hijab improperly and died a few days later. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iranian authorities said she died from a heart attack, but her family said she was badly beaten, leading to mass protests throughout the country. The protests have led to more than a dozen confirmed deaths as many women have burned their hijabs and cut their hair in public in opposition to what happened to Amini and to Iranian policy.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Iran has been rocked by protests over the past week following the death of a 22-year-old woman in police custody who was detained after allegedly not wearing a hijab properly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The country’s morality police, which is responsible for enforcing what is deemed proper religious observance in public, arrested Mahsa Amini earlier this month for violating the state dress code. She collapsed the day she was arrested and died a few days later from what Iranian authorities have said was a heart attack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But many inside Iran and throughout the world, including the United States, have cast doubt on the government’s claims, and hundreds of women have taken to the streets to burn their hijabs in protest of the country’s policies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A hijab is a head covering that some Muslim women wear, covering their heads, necks and ears but leaving their faces visible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iranian officials are attempting to get the largest protests in years under control, using live ammunition, tear gas and pellet guns. Authorities have reportedly confirmed at least 17 deaths, while others have made higher estimates as thousands of Iranians in cities nationwide protest the government’s actions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The leader of the morality police announced in 2017, while the more moderate President Hassan Rouhani was in power, that arrests for dress code violations would no longer occur, but the police force has cracked down this year under President Ebrahim Raisi, who is considered a hard-liner. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A video filmed in the Iranian city of Kerman shows a large group of protesters gathered in public as a woman not wearing a hijab cuts her hair and raises her fist in the air, CNN reported. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Protests have broken out in Iran a few times over the past several years. Demonstrators marched against high fuel prices in 2019 and water and electricity shortages last year.</p>",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/shane-baz-to-undergo-tommy-john-surgery-brandon-lowe-wont-return-in-2022.html",
        "description": "<p>The Rays got two pieces of bad news today, with Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times relaying both (Twitter links). Right-hander Shane Baz will undergo Tommy John surgery which will keep him out of action through the end of the 2023 campaign. Furthermore, Brandon Lowe won’t return here in 2022 due to an ongoing back issue.</p>\n<p>Baz will end his 2022 season with only 27 innings pitched over six starts, as arthroscopic elbow surgery and then an elbow sprain (which has kept him on the injured list since July) limited his ability to get onto the mound. Unfortunately, those elbow problems have now resulted in the worst-case scenario of TJ surgery, and Baz now faces another completely lost season in 2023.</p>\n<p>It was just over a year ago that Baz made his MLB debut, making three starts for the Rays at the end of the 2021 season and then getting another start in their playoff rotation during the ALDS. While entrusting an inexperienced pitcher with a big postseason start didn’t work out well for Tampa Bay, it was a sign of just how much faith the Rays have in Baz as one of the key arms of their future. The righty had become one of baseball’s top pitching prospects during his excellent 2021 minor league season, and thus entered 2022 as a favorite for AL Rookie Of The Year honors.</p>\n<p>Instead, Baz will now be out of action until Opening Day 2024. It is a testament to the Rays’ pitching depth that they are still in prime position to return to the playoffs even without Baz or several other notable injured hurlers (such as another Tommy John patient in Tyler Glasnow, who has missed all of 2022 but might be close to returning for some bullpen work late in the regular season or in the postseason). Still, losing Baz to TJ surgery is naturally a blow to the Rays’ present and future plans, given how young and controllable pitching is such a key plank of Tampa Bay’s strategies.</p>\n<p>Between 2022 and 2023, Baz will bank two full seasons of Major League service time while on the injured list, though he still isn’t eligible for arbitration until after the 2024 season. Assuming he is able to return from rehab in good form, he can use 2024 as a platform for a decent arb payday, but obviously Baz’s first priority is just getting healthy.</p>\n<p>In regards to 2022 alone, having Lowe for only 65 games was an even bigger short-term problem for the Rays than losing Baz, given how Lowe is an established big league talent. After top-10 finishes in AL MVP voting in each of the last two seasons, Lowe hit only .221/.308/.383 over 266 plate appearances, as he was limited by three separate stints on the IL. One of those absences was a minimal 10-day stint due to a biceps contusion, but Lowe was mostly hampered by his lower-back problem.</p>\n<p>It remains to be seen if Lowe might require a surgical fix to fully solve his back problems, and if so, such a procedure might impact his readiness for the start of the 2023 campaign. Arbitration isn’t a factor for Lowe, who had two guaranteed seasons remaining on a six-year, $24MM extension he signed back in March 2019, and he is owed at least $15MM more on that deal (which includes two club options). Given how the Rays are always open to dealing veteran players, it would seem like Lowe’s injury and down year would certainly lessen the chance of a trade, but a move cannot be entirely ruled out.</p>\n<p>Such a decision would hinge on how comfortable the Rays are with their other options at second base. Isaac Paredes, Taylor Walls, Jonathan Aranda, and Vidal Brujan have handled most of the workload with Lowe out, with varying degrees of success. Walls is a premium defender who hasn’t hit much, while Paredes has shown some pop in his first season with the Rays, and Aranda has gotten off to a solid start in his first month in the big leagues. Tampa will now be counting on this mix to help them in the postseason, with Lowe no longer a possibility.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The Yankees won the game, and the series, over the Sox on Saturday.</p> <p>Well, it didn’t come today either. Aaron Judge actually saw more pitches in the zone today than it feels like he had in a while, he had an at-bat stolen by a terrible umpire call, but at the end, he finished the game still on 60 home runs. However, that was pretty much the worst news of the day, as Domingo Germán did his job, three Yankees went deep, and New York topped the Red Sox 7-5.</p>\n<p>Aaron Judge saw three straight fastballs in the zone from Nick Pivetta, going down looking in the first inning. After four or five games of seeing junk, it may have caught the big slugger off guard to have a guy go right after him like that. Fortunately, in that same first inning, Gleyber Torres was a good teammate and picked up his leadoff hitter:</p>\n\n<p>For all the consternation, much of it deserved, about Torres’ terrible August, the second baseman has consistently been a 125-130 wRC+ bat in every other month, and has 24 home runs on the season.</p>\n<p>Oswaldo Cabrera chipped in with a home run of his own, a near carbon-copy of his blast from Wednesday, and one that gave the Yankees back the lead:</p>\n\n<p>Germán had one of those starts again, where you think based on his pitch location that the floor should open up beneath him, but the final line was fine. He did give up back-to-back home runs to Triston Casas and Reece McGuire in the second inning, allowing the Red Sox to take the lead, but he was solid otherwise.</p>\n<p>Five strikeouts in five innings is actually better than he’s done for the most part in this hot run, and a 46 percent whiff rate on his curve with a 36 percent rate on the four-seam showed that he really fooled the Red Sox for most of his outing. I don’t know what his postseason usage will be like, but you can’t really complain about the work he’s put in over the last two months.</p>\n<p>Zack Britton made his first appearance in 13 months, and the less said about it the better. He very much looked like a pitcher coming back from Tommy John surgery, walking three Sox and giving up a hit to Xander Bogaerts. The final walk on his line took the lead down to 5-4, and Lou Trivino was called upon to get out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam. While he was able to do that, Lucas Luetge couldn’t hold on in the top of the seventh, allowing a pair of runners before Alex Verdugo tied the game with an RBI single.</p>\n<p>In the Yankee half, after Aaron Hicks pinch-hit with a walk (pinch-walk?) Judge came up yet again, and again had a strong battle with the pitcher, reliever Jon Schreiber. With a fastball at the top of the zone, Judge appeared to check his swing only to be called out by the first base umpire, inserting himself into history.</p>\n<p>However, like in the first inning, Judge’s teammates were able to pick him up:</p>\n\n<p>Aaron Judge is the most important player to for the Yankees down the stretch, but getting Rizzo back to the hitter he was earlier in the season might be the second most important thing for the lineup. We’ve seen the way the offense can be shut down on days when Judge doesn’t carry the team, and with Gleyber looking back to normal, a healthy and effective Rizzo behind Judge makes pitching around him that much more dangerous.</p>\n<p>Luetge’s troubles continued in the eighth, walking and allowing a hit before yielding to Clarke Schmidt, who himself got some help from the Yankees’ dazzling centerfielder:</p>\n\n<p>Scott Effross continued the annoying-outing-from-Yankee-relievers today, allowing the first two men to come on in the ninth, and forcing us all to debate internally whether we’d trade a blown save for another Aaron Judge at-bat — #99 would have led off the bottom of the ninth. Effross eventually walked the bases loaded, but Bobby Dalbec bounced the ball to Isiah Kiner-Falefa, who recorded the forceout at second to end the game.</p>\n<p>That means Judge’s next chance for #61 will come on Sunday Night Baseball, tomorrow on ESPN at 7pm Eastern. Although there may not be a YES call for history, both David Cone on the regular broadcast and Michael Kay on the KayRod booth will be able to put their stamp on a potential, historic home run.</p>\n<p>Box Score</p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "Photo by Justin Berl/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The Cubs go for their fifth consecutive win.</p> <p>Saturday notes:</p>\n\n\nONE-RUN GAMES: The Cubs played their fourth straight one-run game Friday, all wins. That was the team’s 50th one-run game of the year. Overall they’re 24-26 in one-run games this season, but 14-8 since July 17. It’s the 48th time in the 122 seasons since 1901 that the Cubs have played 50 or more one-run games. The franchise record is 66, set in 1974 (30-36).\n\nWHAT A RELIEF: Over the last 14 games, the Cubs bullpen has posted a 2.31 ERA (13 earned runs in 50⅔ innings) with 20 walks, 56 strikeouts and a .208 opponents BA (38-for-183).\n\nMORE RELIEF: Cubs relievers lead all MLB teams in strikeouts this year with 670, well ahead of the second-place Twins (636).\n\nHE’S HOT: P.J. Higgins, last six games since September 14: .381/.480/.524 (8-for-21), three doubles, four walks.\n\n<p>Here are today’s particulars.</p>\n<p>Cubs lineup:</p>\n\n\n<p>Here is tonight's #Cubs starting lineup in Pittsburgh. pic.twitter.com/269bAXuI3c</p>— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Pirates lineup:</p>\n\n\n<p>Our Saturday night lineup.#LetsGoBucs pic.twitter.com/z2e94HOO2q</p>— Pittsburgh Pirates (@Pirates) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\nWade Miley, LHP vs. Johan Oviedo, RHP\n  \n        \n      USA TODAY NETWORK\n  \n\n  \n        \n      USA TODAY NETWORK\n  \n\n<p>Wade Miley got roughed up in his last start for seven runs in three innings, though four of those runs were unearned due to a Christopher Morel error.</p>\n<p>Miley is the first Cubs pitcher in this series who has previously faced the Pirates this year — and that one went well, May 16 in Wrigley Field. He allowed one hit in seven shutout innings with six strikeouts, unquestionably his best start as a Cub.</p>\n<p>One more just like that tonight, please.</p>\n<p>Johan Oviedo was acquired by the Pirates from the Cardinals in the Jose Quintana deal at this year’s trade deadline.</p>\n<p>He was a long reliever/spot starter in St. Louis and did fairly well, but since being placed in the Pirates rotation the results have been mixed. He’s had two good starts and two bad ones, and previously this year he made two appearances (one start) against the Cubs with a 5.40 ERA and 2.100 WHIP.</p>\n<p>More like that tonight, please.</p>\n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \n<p>Today’s game is on Marquee Sports Network.

If you do go there to interact with Pirates fans, please be respectful, abide by their individual site rules and serve as a good representation of Cub fans in general and BCB in particular.</p>\n<p>The 2022 Game Thread procedure will be like last years, similar to what we’ve used for Spring Training.</p>\n<p>You’ll find the game preview posted separately on the front page two hours before game time (90 minutes for some early day games following night games).</p>\n<p>At the same time, a StoryStream containing the preview will also post on the front page, titled “Cubs vs. (Team) (Day of week/date) game threads.” It will contain every post related to that particular game, including the First Pitch Thread and the overflow thread, as well as the recap when it’s published. The recap will also live on the front page as a separate post.</p>\n<p>You will also be able to find the preview, First Pitch Thread and the overflow thread in the box marked “Chicago Cubs Game Threads” at the bottom of the front page (you can also find them in this section link). The StoryStream for each game can also be found in that section.</p>\n<p>The First Pitch thread will post at five minutes before game time, then an overflow thread at 90 minutes after the scheduled game time.</p>\n<p>Discuss amongst yourselves.</p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "<p>NEW YORK — By the time Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov took the stage at the United Nations General Assembly this week, he and his country had already lost much of the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the annual gathering, world leader after world leader had expressed deep discomfort if not outright condemnation over Russia’s war in Ukraine. Even some countries that have stayed friendly with the Kremlin called for a cease-fire or other ways to end the crisis. Few offered words of comfort to Russia. And Russian President Vladimir Putin, who did not attend UNGA, did himself no favors when he announced mid-week that he was escalating the battle and might even use nuclear weapons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The growing global unhappiness with Russia was hard to miss. A senior U.S. diplomat told POLITICO that some foreign officials turned down Russian invitations to meet on the UNGA sidelines this past week given the optics. “Their dance card wasn’t very full,” the diplomat said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for now, it’s more a shift in tone than anything tangible that could add pressure to the Kremlin economically or militarily — many countries still rely on Russia for oil and gas supplies. Lavrov, for one, seemed to realize this, and so the veteran diplomat did not hold back in his speech Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He insisted that Moscow’s war was just and that Russia was defending itself and Ukraine-based Russian speakers against a neo-Nazi regime in Kyiv — a claim not based in reality. He blamed U.S. and European sanctions for rising food insecurity — an allegation the West denies — not, for instance, Russia’s efforts to block Ukrainian grain shipments. He also cast the expansion of NATO as a threat the Kremlin could not ignore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m convinced that any sovereign, self-respecting state would do the same in our stead, a state which understands his responsibility to his own people,” said Lavrov, a man often described by foreign affairs observers as “wily.” In particular, he slammed the United States, Ukraine’s most critical backer, for its role as a “hegemon” that undermines the global rules it claims to uphold. “Name a country where Washington interfered by force and where, as a result of that, life improved,” Lavrov said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lavrov’s defiance, nonetheless, doesn’t change the uncomfortable reality for Russia that is growing increasingly apparent: Some of its staunchest allies are questioning the wisdom of its war in Ukraine, which has handed Russia a series of major territorial losses in recent days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shift in tone became obvious in the days before the U.N. gathering of world leaders in New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Uzbekistan earlier this month, Putin met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Russian leader acknowledged that fellow autocrat Xi — whose nation is arguably Russia’s most important friend — had raised “questions and concerns” about the Ukraine war. The Indian leader, meanwhile, reportedly told Putin that “today’s era is not an era of war,” which some took to be a careful rebuke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came UNGA, which offered even more countries a platform to express their frustration. “The timing was fortuitous,” a senior U.S. diplomat said of the annual meeting, which usually is held in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some countries didn’t want to avoid the topic of Ukraine, especially those with populations hit by food and energy shortages and price hikes resulting from the war, not to mention from climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic. Latin American and African countries, in particular, have suffered but, for historical and economic reasons, many of those same countries are keen to avoid openly taking sides between Russia and the West when it comes to Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they often emphasized the negative global fallout of the fighting instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The continuation of the hostilities endangers the lives of innocent civilians and jeopardizes the food and energy security of millions of families in other regions, especially in developing countries,” warned Brazilian Foreign Minister Carlos Alberto França.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin’s physical absence from UNGA was not a surprise, but he alarmed those gathered by announcing Wednesday that he was mobilizing hundreds of thousands more troops, supporting referendums to “annex” some Ukrainian territories, and might even use nuclear weapons in his effort to defeat Kyiv. The latter in particular angered many foreign leaders and drew especially strong pushback from U.S.-allied countries that have supported Ukraine from the start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin is engaging in “saber-rattling threats,” said Liz Truss, the new British prime minister. “This will not work.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, there were no major tangible breaks with Moscow from countries such as India and China that continue to fill the Kremlin’s coffers by purchasing Russian energy supplies. Whether Russia keeps getting that level of income could depend on whether European states that also still rely on Russia for energy can agree to price caps currently under discussion. Even if they do, that doesn’t mean major purchasers like in New Delhi or Beijing will go along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, in the world of diplomacy, shifts in tone and talk are often critical steps toward more serious moves, including reducing economic ties, officials and analysts said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think there has been tremendous progress,” said Jonathan Katz, a senior fellow with The German Marshall Fund of the United States. “It is incredibly hard to get countries even diplomatically to shift course, especially when they have direct interest, current or longstanding relations.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charles Kupchan, a former White House National Security Council official, pointed out that not only is Putin facing more global discontent, he’s facing growing anger at home over what he still calls a “special military operation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“More Russians are taking to the streets to protest the war — and leaving the country to avoid military service,” Kupchan said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United States, its European partners, as well as Ukraine itself, seized virtually every opportunity they could during UNGA to make the case that Ukraine was the right side in what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described as a fight between “good and evil, light and dark.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine was the primary focus of President Joe Biden’s UNGA speech, which he delivered hours after Putin unveiled his escalation plans. Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised Ukraine at every turn during an endless series of meetings with global counterparts, including China’s foreign minister. Blinken’s schedule remained punishing even after it was adjusted so Blinken could deal with the death of his 96-year-old father on Thursday. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, also was omnipresent throughout UNGA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lavrov had meetings, too, but — at least from what was publicly available — it was a relatively lean schedule. Those countries whose delegates at UNGA met with Lavrov were typically ones with poor U.S. relations, such as Cuba.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lavrov also seemed intent on avoiding direct encounters with U.S. and Ukrainian counterparts. During a major U.N. Security Council meeting about Ukraine on Thursday, Lavrov came in only to deliver his remarks — which were defiant — and left quickly afterward. U.S. officials said it was just more evidence of growing Russian isolation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another event that U.S. officials saw as a good omen was the overwhelming vote by U.N. member states in favor of letting Zelenskyy address UNGA via a video recording. The rules usually require that a world leader appear in person to speak. If they don’t appear, their foreign ministers may speak, though after heads of state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan Baer, a former U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the Biden team was smart to spend much of its time at UNGA focusing on transnational issues. For instance, the United States hosted a conference on global food security on the sidelines of UNGA and announced billions of dollars in new U.S. funding to help resolve the crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This was not a ‘you’re either with us or against us’ approach,” said Baer, now with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “It was a ‘we’re concerned about the repercussions on the global system — tell us what you’re seeing’ approach.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, one of the lingering frustrations about this past week was with the United Nations itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world body, especially the U.N. Security Council, is not living up to its promise of serving as a forum to resolve global disputes. Russia’s role as a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council has made that body increasingly irrelevant, a fact hard to escape when Putin rattles the proceedings by announcing he’s escalating the war in Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When a permanent member of the Security Council takes the opportunity to double-down on violating the U.N. Charter during the General Assembly with what feels like impunity, I would not say this strengthens the U.N.’s effectiveness,” said Heather Conley, president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. “It reinforces its weakness as an enforcement body.”</p>",

Welcome back to Week in Review, the newsletter where we very quickly sum up the most read TechCrunch stories from the past week.</p>\n<p>Want it in your inbox every Saturday morning? Get it here.</p>\nmost read\n\nGTA 6 footage leaks: Roughly 90 clips of the next Grand Theft Auto game leaked out this week, with the uploader claiming to have hacked Rockstar Games’ internal Slack. Rockstar confirmed the “network intrusion,” adding that they are “extremely disappointed” to see things leaked this way but that development will “continue as planned.”\nWipro fires 300 employees for moonlighting: India’s IT giant Wipro “has fired 300 employees in recent months who were found to be moonlighting for competitors,” writes Manish, with Wipro chairman Rishad Premji calling moonlighting an “act of integrity violation.”\nRevolut hacked: Banking/financial services startup Revolut confirmed this week that hackers were able to breach details for a “small percentage” of its customers. The company declined to get specific about exactly how many customers that works out to, but a breach disclosure filed with authorities in the company’s home country of Lithuania suggests it’s around 50,000.\nBrelyon’s wild monitor: Want something more immersive than a standard monitor but don’t want a VR headset strapped to your face? Brelyon is trying to reimagine the display, and they’ve raised $15 million from a pretty impressive roster of investors to get it done.\nKia and Hyundai sued over design flaw: Earlier this year, a TikTok went viral that publicized a not-very-complicated way to steal certain models of Kia and Hyundai vehicles. Now a class action lawsuit has been filed against the automakers, with the complaint claiming the cars were “deliberately” built without “engine immobilizers,” which Rebecca describes as an “inexpensive and very common device” meant to prevent this issue.\nGoogle’s new Chromecast: Two years ago, Google launched a 4K version of the Chromecast — the first Chromecast to come with a dedicated remote, rather than requiring a smartphone for everything. They’re now bringing the same design plus a remote to the more affordable HD (1080p) model. The HD model will cost $30, while the 4K version will cost $50.\nFacebook users sue Meta over iOS tracking: “The complaint,” writes Taylor, “alleges that Meta evaded Apple’s new restrictions by monitoring users through Facebook’s in-app browser, which opens links within the app.”\n\naudio roundup\n<p>You like podcasts?

        "description": "<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin’s speech announcing a partial military call-up in Russia's war with Ukraine and the upcoming hearing of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol are expected to dominate this week’s Sunday shows circuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin announced on Wednesday that he would be drafting up to 300,000 Russian reservists into the military as the country falters in its now seven-month-long conflict with Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Russians scrambled to leave the country following the announcement, rapidly selling out flights to the countries still accepting planes from Russia. Anti-war demonstrations also swept the country, with Russian authorities detaining more than 1,300 protesters on the day of the announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amid the backlash, Russia on Friday announced exemptions to the call-up for citizens with higher education who work in banking, information technology and telecommunications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The call-up of additional Russian soldiers comes after Ukrainian forces have made several major gains in eastern Ukraine. Russia pulled its forces out of the areas around Kharkiv earlier this month as Ukrainian forces advanced. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who will appear on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, called Putin’s move a “frank admission” that the Russian military is struggling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Russia’s decision on mobilization is a frank admission that their regular army, which has been prepared for decades to take over a foreign country, did not withstand and crumbled,” Zelensky said in an address on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin also threatened to deploy Moscow’s nuclear arsenal in Wednesday’s address, raising concerns in the West.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is not a bluff,” Putin said. “And those who try to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the weathervane can turn and point towards them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on Putin to end his “reckless nuclear threats” at the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan will appear on ABC’s “This Week,” CBS’s “Face the Nation” and NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The House Jan. 6 Committee’s first fall hearing will also likely be a subject of discussion on Sunday's shows. The committee announced this week that it plans to hold a hearing on Sept. 28, the first since its explosive series of hearings this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Members of the committee recently said that they have made progress in their investigation into the Secret Service's actions on the day of the Capitol attack, after it was revealed that the agency lost its communications from Jan. 5 and Jan. 6 in a migration to a new software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, has also agreed to sit before the committee, her lawyer told The Hill on Wednesday. The committee asked Thomas, who has faced scrutiny following revelations that she communicated with top Trump allies leading up to Jan. 6 and pressured state lawmakers to overturn election results, to testify in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several members of the committee are set to make appearances on Sunday. Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) will be on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is the full list of guests scheduled to appear on this week’s Sunday talk shows: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>ABC’s “This Week” — White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan; Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NBC’s “Meet the Press” — Sullivan; Reps.

        "description": "<p>A 23-year-old man from Mississippi was charged on Friday with a hate crime after allegedly burning a cross in his yard to threaten and intimidate a Black family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Axel Cox faces one count of criminal interference with the right to fair housing and one more of using fire to commit a federal felony for allegedly burning the cross in the front yard of his Gulfport, Miss., home, according to a press release from the Department of Justice (DOJ).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Court documents allege that on Dec. 3, 2020, Cox made “racially derogatory” remarks to his Black neighbors while burning the cross to intimidate them, interfering with their housing rights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cox faces up to 10 years in prison for interference with housing rights and a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison for using fire to commit a federal felony. Each charge also carries a fine of up to $250,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is another stark reminder of how bigotry, racism, and hate-fueled violence are alive and well in our country. Mississippi is no exception,” Vangela Wade, president of the Mississippi Center for Justice, told The Associated Press. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The fight to dismantle Mississippi’s deeply entrenched culture of injustice and a better tomorrow continues. We are thankful for the courage of the members of the federal grand jury to indict this hate crime.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division will prosecute the case against Cox alongside Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrea Cabell Jones for the Southern District of Mississippi.</p>",

        "description": "Police officers detain a man in Moscow on Saturday following calls to protest against the military draft announcement.AFP via Getty Images<p>MOSCOW — Russians again protested against President Vladimir Putin's decision to draft additional forces for his struggling military operation in Ukraine — holding scattered demonstrations in dozens of cities across Russia on Saturday despite threats of arrest and a heavy police presence.  </p><p>As nightfall set, over 700 people had been detained nationwide, with the majority of arrests in Moscow and St. Petersburg, according to the human rights monitoring group OVD-INFO.  </p><p>The demonstrations came as Russians continued to grapple with the impact of a Kremlin order to call up an additional 300,000 troops for the military campaign — a move President Putin has framed as \"partial mobilization.\" </p><p>\"I haven't heard the word 'war' out of Putin's mouth. And if there's no war then how can we have a mobilization?\" said Natalya Zurina, a retired university professor, in an interview with NPR.  </p><p>\"He's calling up our young boys to die for nothing. I just couldn't stay home,\" added Zurina.</p><p>Confusion over who would be called up has led to an exodus of young men out of Russia, with long lines forming at Russia's borders and air tickets out of the country hard to come by.  </p><p>Demonstrations against the draft effort earlier in the week led to more than 1,300 arrests, according to rights groups. So far, demonstrations in Moscow appeared to be mostly attended by young Russian women — after protests earlier this week saw detained young men served draft papers while in police custody.   </p><p>On a rainy Saturday in Moscow, police and OMON riot troops appeared well positioned ahead of a late afternoon protest at a location organizers chose at the last moment.</p><p>\"Putin said he wouldn't change the constitution. He changed the constitution. Putin said he there wouldn't be mobilization and yet here we are,\" said a young man in his 20s to NPR at the Moscow protest. </p><p>He did not have the opportunity to give his name before OMON troops suddenly approached, inspected his documents, and took him away. </p><p>Anastasia, a designer who declined to give her last name out of concern for her safety, said she had come to see whether she was alone in her anger over Putin's decision to send additional troops into a conflict she never supported. </p><p>\"I have two relatives directly impacted by this decision but thankfully they're now on their way out of the country,\" she tells NPR. </p><p>\"It's a tragedy what's happening,\" she added through tears. </p>Police officers detain a man in Moscow on Saturday.AFP via Getty Images<p>NPR witnessed several dozen arrests as police checked documents and seemingly made arrests at random.  </p><p>\"I was just coming out of the metro!\" yelled one man as he was thrown up against the side of a police van. </p><p>Online videos later showed riot troops appearing to detain people in a tourist park that overlooks the Kremlin — including one man wearing a food delivery uniform.</p><p>There were scenes of violence as well: in Saint Petersburg, a video shared online showed riot police beating a young protester on his head as he lay on the ground.  </p><p>In Moscow, a video showed a woman's screams coming from inside a police van before the car's engine drowned out her cries. (NPR has not independently verified the authenticity of the videos.)</p><p>The arrests also unfolded as the government raised the consequences of dissent. </p><p>On Saturday, the Russian leader signed into law a bill that now criminalizes refusal to serve in the military with up to 10 years in prison.  </p><p>\nThe move capped a week that saw the measure rushed through both the lower and upper houses of Russia's parliament.\n</p><p>Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "<p>Luis Robert’s 2022 season is officially over, after the White Sox placed the outfielder on the 10-day injured list due to a sprained left wrist.  Left-hander Tanner Banks was also optioned to Triple-A Charlotte, while outfielder Mark Payton was called up from Charlotte and righty Joe Kelly was reinstated from the medical leave list.</p>\n<p>Robert’s wrist has been bothering him since August 12, when he suffered a sprain while trying to steal a base in a 2-0 Chicago win over the Tigers.  White Sox GM Rick Hahn told reporters (including The Athletic’s James Fegan) that Robert’s injury was re-aggravated after he was hit by a pitch on September 6 during a game against the Mariners, which led to Robert receiving more sporadic playing time over the last few weeks.  Three different hand specialists determined that there isn’t any structural damage, Hahn said, but Robert just needs time off to fully heal.</p>\n<p>As a result, Robert has been shut down, ending his season with a .284/.319/.426 slash line and 12 home runs over 401 plate appearances.  His wrist problem seemed to sap his effectiveness at the plate, as Robert had only a .414 OPS over his final 47 PA of 2022.</p>\n<p>Robert also missed time due to blurred vision and the COVID-related IL this season, and thus played in only 98 of Chicago’s games.  Between his absences this season and the hip flexor strain that cost him a big chunk of the 2021 campaign, Robert has played in only 166 of a possible 324 games since the start of the 2021 season.  When he was able to play, Robert posted great numbers in 2021 and his 2022 production was still solidly above average (112 wRC+), but it still represents a disappointment for a player who has shown glimpses of superstar potential.</p>\n<p>The White Sox can only hope that Robert is able to fully heal up over the winter, and is then able to stay on the field for most or all of the 2023 campaign.  Robert’s injury-plagued year is one of but several “if only…” laments South Side fans have about a White Sox season that is looking increasingly like it will fall short of the playoffs.  The 76-75 Sox are on a four-game losing streak, and have dropped to a 76-75 record, falling eight games behind the Guardians in the AL Central and 6.5 games out of the wild card race.</p>",

According to a report from Vanity Fair (via Deadline), Jones signed over the rights to his archival voice work, allowing the Ukrainian startup Respeecher to leverage AI technology and recreate the sound of his voice in Disney Plus’ Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p>\n<p>To do this, Respeecher uses sound bites to “clone” an actor’s voice, allowing a studio to record new lines without having the actor present. Matthew Wood, Skywalker Sound’s supervising sound editor, told Vanity Fair that he presented Jones with the option once he “mentioned he was looking into winding down” the role of Darth Vader....</p>\n  <p>\n    Continue reading…\n  </p>",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/rangers-dane-dunning-to-undergo-arthroscopic-hip-surgery.html",
        "description": "<p>Rangers right-hander Dane Dunning will undergo arthroscopic hip surgery next week, the team announced.  Dunning will finish his 2022 season with a 4.46 ERA, 53.3% grounder rate, 20.4% strikeout rate, and 9.2% walk rate over 153 1/3 innings and 29 starts in the Texas rotation.</p>\n<p>Acquired from the White Sox as the centerpiece of the Lance Lynn trade in December 2020, Dunning’s first two seasons in Texas have been pretty statistically identical, though he tossed only 117 2/3 frames in 2021.  Over both seasons, Dunning has a 4.48 ERA/4.14 SIERA, with below-average strikeout, walk, and hard-hit ball rates.  Dunning’s ability to keep the ball on the ground has helped him avoid major damage, and a .324 BABIP over the last two seasons indicates that the righty has perhaps been a little unlucky in maximizing his return on that strong groundball rate.</p>\n<p>Assuming he returned from this hip surgery in good form, Dunning projects as a rotation piece for the Rangers both in 2023 and over the long term, as he’ll be 28 on Opening Day and is controlled through the 2026 season.  However, the rotation as a whole was not a strength for the Rangers this season, and they are sure to focus on upgrading the pitching staff during what might be another very busy offseason.  The Rangers already parted ways with longtime president of baseball operations Jon Daniels, and the onus will be on general manager Chris Young (a former MLB pitcher himself) to get the club back to contention.</p>\n<p>Jon Gray looks like the only member of the 2022 rotation who is thusly guaranteed a job in next year’s starting five, though Texas is hopeful of re-signing Martin Perez.  Dunning’s track record and ability to at least eat innings may give him a leg up on other younger or more unproven rotation candidates, but nothing can really be ruled out considering how intent Rangers ownership is on fielding a winner.  Dunning has already been part of two notable trades during his relatively short career, and he could be an interesting trade chip once more if the Rangers are looking to overhaul their rotation picture.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Republican Tim Michels said Friday that he would sign an abortion ban with exceptions for rape and incest if it came to his desk as governor, a shift from his earlier statement that Wisconsin's 1849 ban — with an exception only for the life of the mother — was “an exact mirror” of his position.</p><p>Conservative radio host Dan O’Donnell asked Michels whether he would sign a bill passed by the Legislature with exceptions for rape and incest.</p><p>“I am pro-life, but I also understand that this is a representative democracy and if the people, in this case the Legislature, brought a bill before me, I would sign it,\" Michels responded.</p><p>Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, locked in a close race with Michels in the key swing state, supports abortion rights. Evers has backed a lawsuit by Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, that argues the state’s 1849 ban is superseded by another law passed in 1985 that would allow for abortions before the point of viability.</p><p>For months, Michels has campaigned on statements that he wouldn’t support exceptions to the state’s abortion ban. At a Dane County GOP event earlier this month, Michels said he would not soften his stance on abortion, despite receiving calls asking him to support rape and incest exceptions.</p><p>“I'm winning because people see a strong leader, a man of conviction, a man who doesn't waffle, a man who doesn't flip-flop. I'm gonna stick with what I know is right,” he said on Sept. 6.</p><p>Michels' campaign disputed that he was changing his position, saying he had simply answered a question about how he would handle a specific piece of legislation.</p><p>Polls have repeatedly shown that a majority of people in Wisconsin support abortion rights, and Wisconsin Democrats have made their backing of abortion rights central to campaigns this midterm.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Evers' campaign said she doubts that Michels' views have changed.</p><p>\"Tim Michels has told us what he believes time and again, even promising earlier this month that he would not soften his dangerous views on abortion. We know he was telling us the truth over the past two decades as he consistently opposed these exceptions,” Evers spokesperson Kayla Anderson said.</p>",

They have another chance today, with Corbin Burnes on the mound. Burnes has been strong, but hasn’t been as dominant as he has been before. He’s allowed at least three runs in four of his last five starts. The Brewers could use the dominant Burnes tonight to get them a fourth straight win. Surprisingly, Burnes has not made many starts against the Reds. While he’s made 13 appearances against them, only three have been as a starter. This is his second start against them this season. By comparison, Burnes has at least eight starts against each of the Cardinals, Cubs, and Pirates in his career.</p>\n<p>On the Reds side, Graham Ashcraft returns from the IL to make the start tonight. Ashcraft has missed a month with biceps soreness, but has been promising for the Reds this season. In 16 starts in the majors, he’s posted a 3.97 ERA and 3.93 FIP. This is his third start against the Brewers this season. He allowed six runs in his first start against the Brewers on June 18, but only one in his previous start on August 7. </p>\n<p>For scoreboard watchers, the Braves and Phillies started around 3 PM (and may or may not still be playing).

        "link": "https://www.indiewire.com/2022/09/mister-organ-review-1234765982/",
        "description": "<p>Journalist and filmmaker David Farrier — who, in a nod to the homespun modesty of his documentaries, only refers to himself as the former onscreen — has a certain affinity for sinister weirdos. “Tickled,” “My Scientology Movie,” and the new “Mister Organ” reflect a warm but affectless man who’s compelled by the dark underbellies of seemingly benign people and institutions, and can’t help but get sucked into their shady personal dramas. At this point in his career, Farrier seems like a kid who keeps getting his head stuck between the balusters of a staircase because he wants to make a spectacle of pulling it out.</p>\n<p>That isn’t to say his movies aren’t enjoyable, or their subjects unworthy of the scrutiny Farrier gives them, only that it keeps getting harder to shake the suspicion that he’s digging the same rabbit holes that he films himself falling down. Farrier’s latest feature — a characteristically first-person exercise that finds him “stumbling into” a story that consumes several years of his life for our amusement — begins with some parking mishegoss at an Auckland antiques store before unraveling into an intimate portrait of the toxic narcissist who’s terrorized half of New Zealand.</p>\n<p>The man’s name is Michael Organ, and by the time Farrier says that “you pay a soul tax for every minute you spend with him,” this twisty documentary has proven those words true beyond a shadow of a doubt. But when Farrier goes on to lament that “I’m trapped with him because I have to make a film, right?,” I wasn’t immediately sure if it was meant to be a rhetorical question. The sunk-cost fallacy notwithstanding, Farrier doesn’t have to make a film about Organ (whatever moral dimension there might be to sharing this story in the interest of Organ’s future victims, this movie is a bit too self-absorbed to meaningfully flesh it out).</p>\n<p>While Farrier is extremely likable — and his subject the polar opposite of that in every possible way — the documentary he’s made about Organ inadvertently complicates the matter of who is trapped with who, or if anyone is trapped at all. The finished product often feels more like watching a strained pas de deux than it does someone latching onto their prey. That can be a compelling dynamic in its own right (and a revelatory way of exposing how each man works towards their very different ends), but the ambiguousness also dampens the project’s journalistic value, occasionally to the point that “Mister Organ” plays less like a riveting piece of investigative reportage than it does like a deserving hit-piece about some dangerously annoying guy Farrier knows, dislikes for good reason, and really wants you to hate too.</p>\n<p>﻿</p>\n<p>Sympathy for Mister Organ is never on the menu, but the more we learn about him, the less special he becomes. That’s why Farrier’s movie is most compelling in the early going, when its namesake remains a mystery shrouded in ridiculousness. It all starts when Jillian Bashford, the owner of Bashford Antiques, hires her “lawyer” — Michael Organ — to start aggressively clamping any of the cars that are parked outside of her store overnight and charging their owners hundreds of dollars to get the boots removed. It’s exactly the kind of kooky, low-key criminality that Farrier lives for, and so he decides to start digging. “Five years ago I started writing what I thought would be a very simple, quirky story,” the filmmaker intones over the voiceover track, “but here I am half a decade later still trying to make sense of it all.”</p>\n<p>Farrier doesn’t sound too disappointed about that, but it’s not like everything has gone according to plan. I’m sure he was happy to get the clamping law changed (which inspired Bashford to close her store in response), but hindsight being 20/20, he probably regrets stealing the Bashford Antiques sign after it went out of business. That’s when Organ sued him for theft — that’s when Organ latched onto Farrier’s life like a parasite and refused to let go, even after the filmmaker started to return the favor.</p>\n<p>The details of Organ’s dealings aren’t particularly interesting — there’s something about a stolen boat and a string of angry ex-roommates and even the occasional mention of a local terrorist — but the specifics are never that important to a delusional narcissist like him. What Farrier knows from the start, but dances around for all too long, is that Organ is a black hole.</p>\n<p>He only wants to trap people in the reality that he creates so that he can toy with (and torment) them there. He talks and he talks and he talks, for hours on end if you’ll let him. He tells you what you want to hear, and blames other people (in wildly contrived ways) for all of the problems that he’s caused himself. He threatens you one second, and then acts like he’s your best friend the next. If Organ weren’t some random “fuckwit who bores people to death until they jump off a building,” as one of Farrier’s interviewees describes him, he could probably have a career in politics.</p>\n<p>Frequently intriguing — if never quite as tense as Lachlan Anderson’s pulse-pounding electronic score might want you to believe — “Mister Organ” works best as a first-hand forensic analysis of what it’s like when a sociopath locks their sights on you. Whatever his role in enabling (or at least encouraging) Organ’s behavior, the resolutely sane Farrier is a perfect foil for his latest nemesis; the bit in which Organ reveals that he has a key to Farrier’s house is an incredible study of derangement and reasonability colliding on camera.</p>\n<p>Even scarier and more compelling are the chapters of Organ’s life that only survive as tragic anecdotes — the stories about the people who were less accommodating to him than Bashford, or less resistant to him than Farrier. For the most part, Organ comes off as a compulsively obnoxious charlatan who manipulates people for sport and lives free of the consequences that Farrier’s documentary is hoping to confront him with. In the all too brief moments when we hear from his past victims, however (one of whom is no longer alive to share his story), “Mister Organ” offers a somewhat lucid glimpse of the danger that people like him pose to the public. If only it didn’t feel like Farrier himself were standing on the outside looking in, perhaps “Mister Organ” could have offered more than just a glimpse.</p>\nGrade: C+\n<p>“Mister Organ” premiered at Fantastic Fest 2022. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.</p>",

        "description": "<p>With the release of HBO’s “House of the Dragon” and Amazon’s “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,” two major fantasy series premiered last month. </p>\n<p>The former was an instant success on pirate sites where, in true Game of Thrones spirit, it was leaked before the official premiere.</p>\n<p>While both series are hard to compare, the media has pitted them against each other to see which one performs best. Does “The Rings of Power” dwarf “House of the Dragon” or vice versa?</p>\n<p>In terms of user ratings, the Game of Thrones prequel wins by a landslide but official viewer statistics are harder to come by. According to Variety, the Dragons now average 29 million viewers per episode. Amazon hasn’t released much data on its billion-dollar production but previously said that the Rings premiere drew a 25 million audience. </p>\nDragon Crushes Rings on Pirate Sites\n<p>To add our two cents to this battle, we decided to take a look at how both series are doing on pirate sites. With help from IKnow, we looked at a large sample of millions of global BitTorrent transfers over the past two weeks (7-21 September) which resulted in a clear winner. </p>\n<p>“House of the Dragon” takes the crown with more than 1.4 million estimated downloads on peak days. During the two weeks that we collected sample data, the show amassed over 9 million estimated downloads. </p>\n<p>Estimated Torrent Downloads (sample)<br /></p>\n<p>The graph above shows that The “Rings of Power” doesn’t even come close with a maximum of roughly 650k estimated downloads. It typically beats the GOT prequel by just a small margin, shortly after a new episode is released. Over the two weeks, this resulted in 5 million downloads.</p>\n<p>To give an indication of how popular “House of the Dragon” is, on the day of release the show is good for more than 10% of all movie and TV show downloads. That’s a percentage we haven’t seen for a while.  </p>\nRussia on top\n<p>Looking at the countries where “House of the Dragon” is most downloaded, Russia is clearly in the lead. This makes sense as torrent downloads are traditionally popular there.

        "description": "Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, NYC - Home of the bedeviled Dodgers before they moved out west | Sandlot Stats Pintrest Page\n    \n\n  <p>18 Game Improvement done. 20 is coming. Will we get closer tonight?</p> \n\nToday's Lineups\n\n\n\n\nGIANTS\nDIAMONDBACKS\n\n\n\n\nLaMonte Wade - LF\nCorbin Carroll - LF\n\n\nMike Yastrzemski - RF\nPavin Smith - DH\n\n\nWilmer Flores - 1B\nDaulton Varsho - RF\n\n\nBrandon Crawford - SS\nChristian Walker - 1B\n\n\nDavid Villar - DH\nKetel Marte - 2B\n\n\nJason Vosler - 3B\nJosh Rojas - 3B\n\n\nAustin Slater - CF\nAlek Thomas - CF\n\n\nFord Proctor - 2B\nCarson Kelly - C\n\n\nJoey Bart - C\nGeraldo Perdomo - SS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlex Cobb - RHP\nMerrill Kelly - RHP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So....Tommy Henry wasn’t super great last night. C’est la vie n’est pas? We’ve got another shot to win number 71 tonight with Merrill “The Mainstay” Kelly on the bump for the snakes. Opposing him will be Alex Cobb, who is having a pretty good season himself. But he’s definitely not Merrill if our Korean import is on. </p>\n<p>On another sad note, the last two losses mean a .500 season isn’t happening. We all knew this was inevitable, but the hope was there a few weeks ago (for me it’s been alive since the preseason when I voted for 82 wins). But that doesn’t mean there’s nothing to fight for. This team can still overtake the Giants for third place in the division and really rub salt in the wound of last year’s one-off season. And we have three against Milwaukee in October. We could play spoiler for them, which would be fun. </p>\n<p>With next to zero chance we’ll end up with a “top” 6 lottery draft pick entry (I didn’t do the math, it’s totally possible we’ve already been eliminated from the new lottery system), I want to milk every win possible out of the last 10 games. Experiencing meaningful winning baseball all the way to the postseason is more important for the youth than getting a slightly better chance at another top pick. In my opinion at least. </p>\n<p></p>\nOn This Day In History - 1957\n<p>The Brooklyn Dodgers play and win their final game in Ebbets Field. They were two years removed from their first World Series victory and a new owner decided to move them to LA. </p>\n<p>I don’t have much else to offer. This popped up on my search and is baseball related. Personally the creation of Nintendo yesterday is far more interesting, but I understand that may not be true for many in our community. </p>",

The news of the “doctor’s advice” does not ensure that La Russa would not return; given that the White Sox have trotted players in need of surgery (apparently, Michael Kopech, and potentially Luis Robert) out to play this season, let’s not assume the club would bar Tony from the dugout. But it’s looking more and more likely that bench coach Miguel Cairo will finish the season as interim manager.</p>\n<p>Robert, who has spent a month in will-he won’t-he limbo regards to oh, playing time, ability to even swing a bat, etc., was placed on the 10-day IL today, ending his season. </p>\n\n\n<p>Luis Robert is not going to play again this season. Certainly possible that’s the case for Tim Anderson (who will probably need a full eight week recovery from initial injury to be 100%) and Michael Kopech (who likely needs a cyst removed from his knee)</p>— James Fegan (@JRFegan) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Fegan goes on to report that Robert has seen three specialists and GM Rick Hahn is convinced that the center fielder needs mere rest, not surgery. With the front office’s sense of diagnostics, one wonders when the surgery will be scheduled, then.</p>\n<p>You wonder if Mark Payton will get a merited call-up from Triple-A to finish out the season. Payton has cracked Charlotte’s all-time RBI leaders list in recent games:</p>\n\n\n<p>Payton's Place: @MarkPayton2 ranks 8th on our single-season RBI list! pic.twitter.com/swQ10xvSzJ</p>— Charlotte Knights (@KnightsBaseball) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Anderson remains out, and although back with the team to participate in fielding drills and batting practice, there’s no real sense to bringing him back in 2022, with nothing to play for. Kopech, per James Fegan’s tweet above, is almost assuredly done for the year; such would have been from sheer shoulder fatigue and season wear, but with another surgery in the offing, best to rest. </p>\n<p>As for Tony’s future, same as it ever was.</p>\n\n\n<p>Hahn on La Russa: pic.twitter.com/jTcV1VY9rX</p>— Mark Gonzales (@MDGonzales) September 24, 2022",

But I have to watch today, so they might as well get that task done and over with.</p>\n<p>Kris Bubic will take the mound today. The lefty has had two straight starts allowing five runs. For a two-month period during June and July he looked like a competent back-end starter. But before and after that period he’s looked like a guy who will never succeed at the big-league level. For those who are entirely ready to give up on him, I can point only to his reasonably successful 2020 and 2021 campaigns as well as the fact that he was a very-well regarded prospect when he was promoted even among non-Royals scouts. Everything he needs to be successful is there, he and the Royals (or some other team if they give up on him) just need to figure out how to make it all consistently come together.</p>\n<p>The Mariners will counter with right-hander Logan Gilbert. The 25-year-old feels like what we hoped would happen for the Royals. He debuted last season and was reasonably good but has been excellent for the Mariners this season. He has gone six straight starts without allowing more than two runs. Maybe he’s due? He hasn’t started against KC this year but he went up against them twice last season and walked away with a 4.91 ERA after allowing six runs in eleven innings. He’s done an excellent job limiting walks and home runs so if the Royals hope to get to him, it will probably entail a rerun of the “Keep the Line Moving” days.</p>\nLineups\n\n\n<p>Here's how we'll take the field tonight as we look to secure the series vs. Seattle.#TogetherRoyal pic.twitter.com/FRN7scHv8m</p>— Kansas City Royals (@Royals) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Round ✌️ in the City of Fountains. pic.twitter.com/nWtReftL1G</p>— Seattle Mariners (@Mariners) September 24, 2022",

        "description": "<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the United States of “playing with fire around Taiwan” in a speech to the U. N. General Assembly on Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They are promising military support to Taiwan,” Lavrov said. “Clearly, the notorious Monroe Doctrine is becoming global in scope. Washington is trying to turn the entire world into its own backyard.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Monroe Doctrine — a 19th century U.S. policy that forbid further European colonization of Latin America — essentially established a U.S. sphere of influence over the Western Hemisphere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tensions between the U.S. and China have remained heightened since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) made a controversial visit to Taiwan last month. Beijing launched a series of military drills in the Taiwan strait following Pelosi’s visit, with Taiwan accusing China of rehearsing an invasion of the island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Biden affirmed in a recent interview with “60 Minutes” that the U.S. would defend Taiwan against an attack. However, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that “any move to obstruct China’s reunification is bound to be crushed by the wheels of history.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. has maintained its “one China” policy since reestablishing relations with Beijing in the late 1970s. Under the policy, the U.S. walks a fine line, recognizing Beijing as the sole legal Chinese government while maintaining an unofficial relationship with Taiwan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his speech, Lavrov also more broadly railed against the U.S. and its allies, calling the European Union an \"authoritarian, harsh, dictatorial entity\" and harshly criticizing U.S. foreign policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"At some point in the past, declaring that they were victorious in the Cold War, Washington erected themselves into an almost envoy of God on Earth, without any obligations but only the sacred right to act with impunity whenever and wherever they want,\" he said. \"And this can be done anywhere, against any state, especially if they've somehow displeased the self-proclaimed masters of the world.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding Russia specifically, Lavrov claimed “the official Russophobia in the West is unprecedented now, the scope is grotesque.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They are not shying away from declaring the intent to inflict not only military defeat on our country but also to destroy and fracture Russia,” he said.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday offered guaranteed protections to Russian soldiers who surrender amid the conflict between the countries after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced he was calling up 300,000 reservists to replenish Russian forces. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Appealing directly to Russians during an address, Zelensky said Ukraine could guarantee three terms to Russian soldiers in exchange for their surrender. He said such Russians will be treated in a civilized manner, the circumstances of their surrender will remain undisclosed and Ukraine will find a way to ensure those who do not want to return to Russia are not exchanged. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin announced the call ups on Wednesday as Ukraine pushes Russian forces back from territory they captured during the war. Ukraine has undertaken a major counteroffensive this month through which it has recaptured thousands of square kilometers of territory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin’s announcement sparked protests nationwide in Russia and led to more than 1,000 arrests. Flights out of the country sold out or their prices soared after Russia called up another round of soldiers, marking the first such mobilization since World War II. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zelensky said Russian authorities are aware they are sending citizens to their deaths but do not have any other option at this stage of the war. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pentagon said last month that Russia has seen 70,000 to 80,000 casualties since its war in Ukraine began in February. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Russian commanders do not care about the lives of Russians. They just need to replenish the empty spaces left by the dead, wounded, those who fled or the Russian soldiers that were captured,” Zelensky said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said every Russian citizen knows that Russia is the one bringing “evil” even if they do not admit it. He told Russians that surrendering to Ukrainian captivity is better than being killed in the war. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So, the key moment has come for you: right now it is being decided whether your life will end or not,” Zelensky said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin reportedly signed laws on Saturday strengthening the penalty for Russian soldiers who voluntarily surrender to up to 10 years in prison. Those who refuse to engage in combat will also face 10 years imprisonment.</p>",

The Internet is not a symposium; it is a gladiator pit and bitch, you are not armed. You are debating the unemployed, literal children, and men with dookie streaks in their draws because they think wiping properly is [bends hand at wrist]. Social media is for shitposting, constructing a false narrative about your life, catfishing, trauma-dumping, and cyberbullying -- nothing less, nothing more. You are taking precious time out of your day that could have been spent getting ignored by your friends, being touch-deprived, or being underpaid. And to what? Argue with a stranger on the nuances of the term 'toxic masculinity' on a platform that is known for tweens popularizing mediocre dances, thirst-trapping, and vacuous virtuous signaling. Don't you get it? There is no winning in this game.\"<br />\n<br />\nElsewhere.",

        "description": "<p>Reds right-hander Art Warren recently underwent a surgery to fix some UCL damage in his throwing elbow, manager David Bell told reporters (including MLB.com’s Mark Sheldon).  The procedure wasn’t a Tommy John surgery, as Bell noted that it didn’t involve ligament replacement.</p>\n<p>While Warren has seemingly avoided the worst-case scenario of a TJ surgery, it isn’t yet known when he might return to the mound, or if his readiness for the start of Spring Training or even Opening Day 2023 is now in question.  Warren was placed on the Triple-A injured list earlier this week, and he spent over six weeks on the Reds’ IL earlier this season due to a right flexor pronator strain.</p>\n<p>Between these injuries and an oblique strain that resulted in a 60-day IL stint in 2021, Warren has had trouble staying healthy since being acquired by the Reds in January 2021.  The right-hander did post a 1.29 ERA over 21 innings in 2021, but his ERA (6.50), strikeout rate (24.2%) and walk rate (13.3%) were all much worse over his 36 frames of work this season.</p>\n<p>Cincinnati was set to give Warren a look at closer heading into the season, but his struggles and injuries cost him any chance of locking down a substantial late-game role.  Unless the Reds simply don’t trust Warren’s health, it’s likely that the 29-year-old and local product will get another shot in the bullpen mix next season.  Since Warren isn’t arbitration-eligible until the 2024-25 offseason, there isn’t any real financial cost to the Reds in giving Warren another look.  Because he was in the minor leagues at the time of his injury, Warren won’t accumulate any MLB service time while he recovers.</p>",

        "description": "Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Can the Rockies win their final night-home game? Tune in tonight to find out!</p> <p>The Colorado Rockies continue their final home stand of the season against the San Diego Padres, who are currently sitting in the third Wild Card spot behind the Atlanta Braves and Philadelphia Phillies. Last night the Rox snapped their five-game home losing streak with a 4-3 extra-inning Alan Trejo walk-off — his first career walk-off, and first career hit in extra innings. The win also clinched a home winning record for the Rox (41-38).</p>\n<p>The win was also highlighted by the debut of 21-year-old Ezequiel Tovar (No. 1 PuRP). The shortstop recorded went 2-for-4, becoming the 17th player in franchise history to have multiple hits in his major league debut. Elehuris Montero also did it on May 1.</p>\n<p>Chad Kuhl (6-9, 5.48 ERA) will take the mound for the final time at Coors Field in 2022. Kuhl started hot, but has gone 1-4 with an 8.53 ERA in 11 starts since his complete game shutout of the Dodgers on June 27. He has also allowed 17 home runs over that span — an average of 3.02 homers per nine. In his last start again San Francisco on Monday, he did not factor into the decision but threw 4 2/3 innings and allowed five runs on a season-high tying eight hits while walking one and striking out six. His 10 no-decisions are tied for the most on the club alongside Kyle Freeland.</p>\n<p>Kuhl will face You Darvish (15-7, 3.05 ERA), who is riding a 16-inning scoreless streak (his career-long is 18, set in 2018). Darvish has posted back-to-back starts of six or more scoreless innings, the fourth time he’s done so in his career (first time since 2019). He’s never had three straight, though… Darvish is also one win shy of his career high, set in 2012 during his rookie season.</p>\n<p>The Padres are 1-7 at Coors Field this season, and have lost 14 of their last 17 in Denver dating back to May 12, 2021. Hopefully the Rockies can continue their home winning streak against the Friars!</p>\n<p>First Pitch: 6:10 AM MDT</p>\n<p>TV: AT&amp;T Sports Net Rocky Mountain; MLB.tv</p>\n<p>Radio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM; KNRV 1150 (Spanish)</p>\n<p>Lineups:</p>\n\n\n<p>Ready for round 2. pic.twitter.com/lhKQwOZIP1</p>— San Diego Padres (@Padres) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Last night was fun....<br /><br />Let's do it again, shall we? pic.twitter.com/dwMSgzXPxT</p>— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) September 24, 2022",

It’s been a rollercoaster of a season, and in this pitiful home stretch, the South Siders will try not to melt into nothingness like a huge pile of sugar in a rainstorm. That was me putting the same amount of effort into writing this gamethread as the White Sox are putting into games.</p>\n<p>It would be nice to see a four-game losing streak end this evening, but as the weather gets cooler, so have our boys’ drive to win. </p>\n<p>The White Sox announced today that Tony La Russa will be out as manager for the remainder of the year, per the advice of his medical team, and Miguel Cairo will continue managing in his stead.</p>\n\n\n<p>pic.twitter.com/k7FCtNPjL0</p>— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>We also had some roster moves. Luis Robert is out, and we’ll be seeing Mark Payton in left field. Super-duper exciting. I’m on the edge of my seat.</p>\n\n\n<p>#WhiteSox announce four roster moves: pic.twitter.com/wEet84TIQ7</p>— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Davis Martin (2-4, 3.78 ERA) is on the mound, throwing lukewarm milk, probably. </p>\n\n\n<p>Tonight's #WhiteSox starters at Guaranteed Rate Field.<br /><br />⏰: 6:10 p.m. CT<br /> : @NBCSChicago <br /> : @ESPN1000 <br /> : @FDSportsbook <br /> : CWS to have most hits -125 pic.twitter.com/0CAoj0G5I4</p>— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Drew Hutchison (2-9, 4.59 ERA) will give the White Sox a good chance to break the losing streak. He lost to the White Sox his last time out, but I’m keeping my expectations in the lower levels of hell.</p>\n\n\n<p>Lining up under the lights for Game 2. pic.twitter.com/AZ3oupvXOb</p>— Detroit Tigers (@tigers) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>First pitch is at 6:10 p.m. CST on NBC Sports Chicago, or listen on ESPN 1000.

        "description": "<p>Former top Pence aide Marc Short on Friday rejected a recent claim from former President Trump that presidents can declassify documents by thinking about it, calling the notion “absurd.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“That’s absurd, obviously,” Short told CBS News. “I think it would make it very difficult for the intelligence community to have a classification system if that was the case.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Short, who served as chief of staff to former Vice President Pence, added that he and the former vice president did not operate on that standard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Wednesday that presidents can declassify materials simply by “thinking about it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There doesn’t have to be a process, as I understand it,” Trump said. “If you’re the president of the United States, you can declassify just by saying, ‘It’s declassified.’ Even by thinking about it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former president has repeatedly claimed that he declassified the more than 300 classified documents recovered from his Mar-a-Lago home since he left office. Trump and the Justice Department are currently battling in court over the status of the documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump’s legal team faced pushback in court this week over its declassification claims. Judge Raymond Dearie, the special master assigned to review documents recovered from Mar-a-Lago, reportedly seemed irked at a meeting on Tuesday when Trump’s team resisted his request to further elaborate on a filing that noted the former president could have declassified the records.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An appeals court also noted this week that “the record contains no evidence that any of these records were declassified.” The court granted the Justice Department’s appeal to exempt classified documents from the special master's review.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Phillies outfielder Nick Castellanos is planning to return to the lineup on Tuesday, when the Phils begin a three-game series with the Cubs.  Castellanos hasn’t played since September 2 due to an oblique strain, but after taking part in baseball activities today, he believes he is ready to get back onto the field without the benefit of a minor league rehab assignment.</p>\n<p>“[The team] asked if I think I need one and I said no,” Castellanos told NBC Sports Philadelphia’s Jim Salisbury and other reporters.  “I just feel like the sooner I can get back and play and lose myself in a baseball game, the better….I’ve known so many people that have gone down and done fantastic in their rehab assignments and then have come up and it’s a new game.  My philosophy is the sooner I can get back into a game that’s important, the better.”</p>\n<p>Another set of on-field activities are slated for tomorrow, and if Castellanos comes out of those workouts feeling good, it would seem as if he’ll be activated from the 10-day injured list in time for Tuesday’s game.  (The Phillies don’t play on Monday.)  Castellanos said that swinging a bat was the last step in his rehab, as he hadn’t had any issues running or throwing for several days.  In general, Castellanos said that “I wouldn’t say [I feel] 100 percent, but I don’t feel like I need to be 100 percent.  I just don’t want to feel restricted or like I could injure myself again.”</p>\n<p>As the Phillies continue to battle for an NL wild card slot, Castellanos is certainly eager to return to the playoff race after missing much of September.  Adding to his frustration, Castellanos was seemingly breaking out of his season-long slump at the time of his injury.  Castellanos hit .318/.348/.505 over his last 112 plate appearances prior to his IL stint, after delivering a disappointing .250/.294/.367 slash line in his first 419 PA of the season.  Matt Vierling, Phil Maton, and Dalton Guthrie have seen the bulk of work in right field in Castellanos’ absence.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>A rough outing from Jacob deGrom kicked off a very annoying day in Oakland.</p> <p>After gaining a game in the standings with a dominant win on Friday, the Mets followed up with a dud, losing to the lowly A’s 10-4. Starting from the bottom of the first, nearly nothing went right in this one; Jacob deGrom made his worst start in years, the offense dried up, the bullpen was poor, and every A’s hit seemed to drive in another run. One of those games that’s best forgotten.</p>\n<p>Initially, things seemed to be heading in the same direction as Friday’s 9-2 win. A Francisco Lindor sacrifice fly was followed by a home run from Pete Alonso, giving the Mets a 3-0 lead in the top of the first. deGrom began struggling immediately in the bottom half however, loading the bases with one out before ultimately giving up four runs. Angel Hernandez played a role to be sure with his usually awful zone clearly irking deGrom, but Jakes control was also uncharacteristically off. In any case, the Mets’ lead was quickly replaced with a one-run deficit.</p>\n<p>Mark Vientos leveled the score with his first career homer in the second. deGrom steadied in the bottom of the second as well, and it seemed like we might be headed for a more normal game. Instead, deGrom gave up another run in the third - a long home run from Seth Brown - and the Mets were back down again. It was the first time since 2019 that deGrom had given up more than three runs in a start. </p>\n<p>With their ace out of the game, the Mets basically rolled over. Bloops and bleeders continued to find grass and let the A’s score one run in each of the fifth, sixth, and seventh. Some particularly bad pitching from Trevor May and awful defense from Darin Ruf in right field led to two more runs in the eighth. Meanwhile, Oakland flashed the leather at every available opportunity, robbing multiple Mets with diving grabs or nifty plays on the infield. The end result is an extremely annoying loss, and the game fittingly ended with a diving catch by A’s shortstop Nick Allen.</p>\n<p>The loss drops the Mets to 96-57, shrinking their division lead to two games - one in the loss column - with the Braves still playing. Games like this do happen, even against awful teams, but it’s still a missed opportunity to maintain some cushion with a critical series against Atlanta on the horizon. Max Scherzer will look to do just that tomorrow against JP Sears in the final game of the series in Oakland.</p>\nSB Nation GameThreads\n<p>Amazin’ Avenue<br />Athletics Nation</p>\nBox scores\n<p>ESPN<br />MLB.com</p>\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs.com\n  \n<p>What’s WPA?</p>\n<p>Big winner: Mark Canha, +10.7% WPA<br />Big loser: Jacob deGrom, -38.5% WPA<br />Total pitcher WPA: +4.6% WPA<br />Total batter WPA: -54.5% WPA<br />Teh aw3s0mest play: Pete Alonso homers in the first, +16.7% WPA<br />Teh sux0rest play: Dermis Garcia drives in two in the bottom of the first, -19.1% WPA</p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "Photo by Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Wright tossed 5.1 no-hit innings before allowing a double and homer in the sixth.</p> <p>After scoring one (1) run total during the first two games of the series, the Atlanta bats put together a 14-hit, 6-run performance on Saturday afternoon in a 6-3 defeat of the Philadelphia Phillies. With the win, which was Kyle Wright’s 20th of the season, the Braves snapped a three-game losing skid and improved to 94-58 on the year, while the Phillies dropped to 83-68.</p>\n<p>On the mound, Wright did not allow a hit until the sixth inning, and the only Philadelphia baserunners that reached before then did so courtesy of a pair of two-out walks and an error by Austin Riley, who was playing first base in place of Matt Olson (that is, until the everyday first baseman entered as part of a defensive adjustment in the eighth). Wright would ultimately exit the game having allowed two runs on two hits with six strikeouts and two walks in 5.1 innings pitched.</p>\n\n\n<p>Kyle Wright, Two Seamer and Curveball, Overlay<br /><br />What Hoskins thought he was swinging at. pic.twitter.com/f8sKHC2xXF</p>— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>On offense, Dansby Swanson got the game off to a good start with a single to left field on the first pitch he saw, but the real fireworks wouldn’t start until the next inning, when Travis d’Arnaud led off with a double that resulted from a combination of afternoon shadows that fooled Kyle Schwarber and an impressive slide to avoid Jean Segura’s tag.</p>\n\n\n<p>Travis d'Arnaud's afternoon swim lessons  ‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/JT5LyTrLyZ</p>— Bally Sports: Braves (@BravesOnBally) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The Atlanta catcher would advance to third on a Michael Harris II groundout and come around to score on a Vaughn Grissom single that bounced up the middle and gave the Braves their first lead of the series.</p>\n<p>William Contreras doubled that lead in the third with an opposite field shot, good for his 20th homer of the season.

A Robbie Grossman strikeout brought up Swanson, who connected for a single that scored Grissom and upped the Braves’ lead to 5-0. The RBI was the 89th of the season for Swanson, marking a new career high for the shortstop.</p>\n<p>The hit parade continued with a Contreras single that scored Arcia, at which point the Phillies pulled starter Bailey Falter. Riley struck out to end the frame, but the four-run outburst was a very welcome sight for what had been quite the quiet Braves offense.</p>\n<p>Atlanta had a promising threat in the fifth, putting runners on second and third with one out via a d’Arnaud single combined with a Harris II double over the head of centerfielder Brandon Marsh, but neither scored. The rally would prove to be the last of the day for the Braves, whose primary offensive notes for the remainder of the game were that 1) Harris II came within a triple shy of a cycle after an infield single in the seventh and 2) with a single in the ninth, Contreras had a three-hit game while occupying the second spot in the lineup.</p>\n<p>The Phillies finally ended both the no-hitter and the shutout in the sixth inning. Wright did get Schwarber to fly out to start the frame, but Rhys Hoskins doubled to left field, and Bryce Harper followed it up with a homer to cut the Braves’ lead to 6-2. Collin McHugh then replaced Wright and retired the next two Philadelphia hitters thanks in part to a nice snag by Riley at first.</p>\n<p>In the Philadelphia half of the seventh against Raisel Iglesias, Marsh reached on an honest error by Riley, who was charging the grounder like he would at third, and Segura followed it up with a single. A Bryson Stott fielder’s choice put runners on the corners with one out, and Nick Maton hit a sacrifice fly that scored Marsh. Brian Snitker then went to AJ Minter, and he walked Schwarber and went to a full count on Hoskins but got a strikeout to keep the score at 6-3.</p>\n\n\n<p>Reminder: A.J. Minter is elite. pic.twitter.com/QKqQsLTkc9</p>— Bally Sports: Braves (@BravesOnBally) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Minter tossed a one-two-three inning in the eighth, and Kenley Jansen did the same in the ninth to earn his 37th save of the year.  </p>\n<p>The four-game series wraps up tomorrow at 1:05PM with Charlie Morton slated to face Kyle Gibson.</p>\n<p></p>",

The Dodgers right-hander was placed on the 15-day injured list on Saturday with low back tightness. Now the only question is whether May will be ready to pitch in the postseason.</p>\n<p>Because May pitched Wednesday, the most the Dodgers could have backdated his injured list stint is two days, to Thursday. But even if they could backdate the IL stint the full three days, May’s 15 days would sideline him through October 5, the end of the regular season.</p>\n<p>May has been up and down in his return from Tommy John surgery, putting up a 4.50 ERA in seven starts, with 29 strikeouts in 30 innings, but also 14 walks (an 11-percent rate) and five hit batters. He allowed 15 runs in 19 innings over his last four starts.</p>\n<p>The National League Division Series starts on Tuesday, October 11, so May has about two and a half weeks to recover to be able to pitch in that series.</p>\n<p>It’s another question mark for the back end of a Dodgers pitching staff that has plenty of them. Beyond Julio Urías, Clayton Kershaw, and Tyler Anderson, the Dodgers options for a fourth starter are sparse. Tony Gonsolin hasn’t pitched since August 23, sidelined by a right forearm strain, and is expected to pitch two innings for Triple-A Oklahoma City on a rehab assignment on Tuesday. Andrew Heaney has a 4.81 ERA and has allowed 11 home runs over his last seven starts.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers will need to find some combination of pitchers to fill innings from that group plus the bullpen, which currently has Yency Almonte, Blake Treinen, and David Price still on the injured list.</p>\n<p>In the interim, Andre Jackson was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City, continuing his yo-yo from the last two weeks, getting called up three times and sent down twice over the last fifteen days.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Rockies are wrapping their fouth straight losing season, yet the organization hasn’t felt compelled to make a change in the dugout.  General manager Bill Schmidt told reporters (including The Athletic’s Nick Groke) today that manager Bud Black will return for the 2023 season, saying that “Buddy came here right when we were ready to be good.  He led us to some playoffs.  He’s very capable of doing it again.  It’s not for lack of effort.”</p>\n<p>Black’s first two seasons in Colorado indeed resulted in postseason appearances.  The Rockies earned wild-card berths in both 2017 and 2018, and in the latter season defeated the Cubs in the Wild Card Game to advanced to the NLDS (where the Brewers eliminated the Rox in a sweep).  Since those two playoff berths, however, the Rockies have yet to reach the .500 mark, and Black has a 414-445 overall record as he approaches the end of his sixth season as Colorado’s skipper.</p>\n<p>The two wild-card berths earned Black a contract extension prior to the 2019 season, a three-year deal that ran from 2020-22.  The Rockies added another year of control in another contract extension last February, with Black extended for a one-year deal that runs through the 2023 campaign.  The relatively limited nature of that extension seemed to indicate that Black was on a slightly shorter leash, yet it doesn’t appear to have hampered his job security.</p>\n<p>In fact, Groke notes that Black is “on a rolling year-to-year contract” that would seemingly give both sides the flexibility to walk away after any season, not that such a scenario seems likely in the near future.  It would seem like Black’s arrangement could be similar to the so-called handshake deal that the Rockies had with former manager Jim Tracy, wherein Tracy had the freedom to leave at the end of any season.</p>\n<p>Rockies owner Dick Monfort is known to value loyalty and continuity within his organization, which has proven to be a double-edged sword considering that the Rockies are often criticized for being too insular.  The change from Jeff Bridich to Schmidt (another long-time front office employee) in the GM chair last season didn’t do anything to get Colorado on track in 2022, and a lot of work will need to be done to make the team a winner in 2023.  Virtually every member of the Rox roster had an underwhelming season either at the plate or on the mound, and prized free agent signing Kris Bryant ended up spending most of the year on the injured list.</p>\n<p>With all this in mind, it is somewhat difficult to really evaluate Black’s win-loss record.  For as much as Monfort and company perpetually feel that the Rockies are on the verge of contention, Black doesn’t seem to be receiving much of the blame for not winning with these flawed rosters.  While it can also be argued that Black isn’t necessarily part of a solution to the Rockies’ woes, Colorado’s bigger-picture issues in evaluating, developing, and acquiring talent seem like much larger obstacles to success than Black’s work as manager.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Bill Schmidt’s first full season as the Rockies’ general manager was highlighted by the signing of outfielder Kris Bryant to a seven-year, $182 million contract and the hope that the club would be, if not a playoff team, then at least in the hunt.</p>\n<p>But injuries have limited Bryant to 42 games and he won’t play again this season. And the Rockies headed into Saturday night’s game against San Diego in last place in the National League West with a 65-86 record and on pace to finish the season 70-92.</p>\n<p>“Needless to say, this season hasn’t met our expectations,” Schmidt said Saturday as he met with media prior to the penultimate home game of the season. “But at the same point, a lot of good things happen that don’t show up every day. And I say that in terms of our minor leagues and some of the foundational pieces that we are going to need going forward.”</p>\n<p>Schmidt began his interview session by making a point to thank Rockies fans, who’ve given the Rockies’ the 11th-best home attendance in the majors, averaging 32,191 fans per game at Coors Field.</p>\n<p>“Their backing is not lost on our staff or the players,” Schmidt said. “We don’t take that for granted and we truly appreciate everything they do for us.”</p>\n<p>Schmidt fielded a wide array of questions. Following are some of the highlights:</p>\n<p>—  When making such a huge investment in Bryant, were there concerns about the consequences if he didn’t produce?</p>\n<p>“No, I’m not negative. There’s no reason to have that feeling because Kris has always (teed) it up. It was little, freakish injuries — the back, plantar fasciitis. You can’t plan (for that).”</p>\n<p>— Where did the Rockies come up short in 2022?</p>\n<p>“We didn’t play defense to the standards that we normally play. And our situational hitting left a lot to be desired, at times.”</p>\n<p>— How did the offense perform after it was targeted as the club’s top priority in the last offseason?</p>\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tIs manager Bud Black the right man to end the Rockies’ slide?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies buried by Padres’ six-run seventh inning\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies knock off Padres on Alan Trejo’s walk-off single\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies starter Antonio Senzatela coming to grips with ACL injury: “It’s part of life”\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies’ Ezequiel Tovar ready for his major-league close up\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n<p>“Well, the one guy (Bryant) only played (42) games and I thought he was an aircraft carrier for us. … Losing Bryant not only affected him it affected the rest of the lineup.</p>\n<p>“(Outfielder Randal) Grichuk, he’s close to his career numbers. So I think that one kind of played out for us.”</p>\n<p>Grichuk entered Saturday’s game hitting .265 with 16 homers and 67 RBIs. His career-high came in 2019 with Toronto when he hit 31 homers and drove in 80 runs.</p>\n<p>— The Rockies are the worst road team in the majors. How do they improve next season?</p>\n<p>“We have to play the game better than we do, and that really comes back to situational hitting. That means getting on base, getting the guy over and getting the guy in.”</p>\n<p>— Will the Rockies expand their analytics department, which remains one of the smallest in the majors?</p>\n<p>“We’ll evaluate all of our processes. How can we get better? With Brian Jones taking over the (research and development) department and adding more people there, that’s going to help in our decision-making process. … We’ll continue to grow that area.”</p>\n<p>— Will finding a leadoff hitter be a top offseason priority?</p>\n<p>“If (we) can find one that fits the club pretty good.”</p>\n<p>— The Rockies’ 2022 payroll is approximately $140 million, ranking 17th in the majors (according to Spotrac). What will their payroll be in 2023?</p>\n<p>“We’ll address that in the offseason, when we get to the end of this season.”</p>\n<p>— Are right-hander Peter Lambert (elbow injury) and lefty Ryan Rolison (shoulder surgery) viable options for 2023?</p>\n<p>“They should be ready to go. Peter is going to pitch in the Arizona Fall League and we’ll see how that goes. He should be able to get 30 or 40 innings if everything goes right.</p>\n<p>“Both guys should be able to go shoot for, from what I’ve been told, pitching next season.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>The Tigers placed right-hander Joe Jimenez on the 15-day injured list due to a right lumbar spine strain.  Right-hander Angel De Jesus was called up from Triple-A to take Jimenez’s spot on the active roster for the remainder of the regular season.</p>\n<p>Jimenez told reporters (including Chris McCosky of The Detroit News) that he has been dealing with the injury for over a month, and he’d been wearing an electronic stimulation device on his back.  Yesterday, however, Jimenez said the back pain “felt different and I just said, ’Hey, I’m not going to put the team in a bad position. I’m just going to do everything I can to get back soon.’ ”</p>\n<p>While further imaging and tests are inevitable, it doesn’t seem as though the spine strain will keep Jimenez from a relatively normal offseason, or from being ready for Spring Training.  That’s good news for both Jimenez and the Tigers, as the 27-year-old (28 in January) looks to build on what has been a career year.</p>\n<p>Consistency has been difficult to come by for Jimenez over his six MLB seasons, even though he was an All-Star in 2018.  Over 209 1/3 innings from 2017-21, Jimenez posted a 5.72 ERA over 209 1/3 innings out of Detroit’s bullpen, and there was some speculation that the Tigers could even non-tender him last winter.</p>\n<p>However, the Tigers’ decision to hang onto Jimenez ended up being one of the best calls of an otherwise rough year in the Motor City.  Jimenez posted a 3.49 ERA and an elite 33.3% strikeout rate over 56 2/3 innings in 2022, as well as plenty of other Statcast metrics that were well above the league average.  That 3.49 ERA undersold Jimenez’s dominance, as he had a 2.30 SIERA and 2.70 xFIP.  Four of Jimenez’s 22 earned runs were allowed over his last two outings, likely due to his increased back pain.</p>\n<p>Between these numbers and Jimenez also being arbitration-controlled through the 2023 season, there was lots of interest in Jimenez heading into the trade deadline, but no teams met the Tigers’ reportedly high asking price.  With Scott Harris now installed as Detroit’s president of baseball operations, it is possible Harris could revisit the trade market and explore selling high on Jimenez, assuming that rival teams aren’t wary of the spine strain.  Or, the Tigers could simply hang onto Jimenez and hope that he can again help a bullpen that was the team’s only real strength this past season.</p>",

        "description": "<p>It wasn’t looking likely that Kris Bryant would get back onto the field before the season was over, and the Rockies slugger confirmed to MLB.com’s Thomas Harding that his 2022 season is indeed done.  Bryant’s first season in Colorado concludes with only 42 games played, and a .306/.376/.475 slash line over 181 plate appearances.</p>\n<p>Three separate stints on the injured list spoiled Bryant’s year, including two absences related to lower-back problems.  Bryant hasn’t played since July 31 due to foot injuries, including both a bone bruise and plantar fasciitis in his right foot.  With the Rockies already out of contention by August, Bryant said he received a platelet-rich plasma injection on August 24, and “if we were in the playoff hunt, I probably would have pushed through and got a cortisone shot.  The PRP is more healing, while cortisone masks the pain.”</p>\n<p>The decision puts Bryant in better position to be fully ready for 2023, and he indicated that he is ahead of schedule in his recovery.  “I wanted to get as close to being able to play a game as I could, because then I can formulate an offseason approach that’s better,” Bryant said.</p>\n<p>Though injuries have been an increasing factor for Bryant in recent years, 2022 represents far and away the lowest game total of his seven regulation-length Major League seasons.  (Bryant’s 42 games with Colorado barely topped his 34 appearances in the shortened 2020 campaign.)  Unsurprisingly, Bryant described his season as “a little depressing, just not playing baseball….Every year from February to October, I’m used to playing baseball.  And for the most part this year, I’ve been watching.”</p>\n<p>Bryant and the Rockies can only hope for better things in 2023 and beyond, as Bryant still has six seasons remaining on his seven-year, $182MM free agent deal from last winter.  On the plus side, Bryant hit well when he was healthy this year, though he hit much better on the road (.996 OPS in 70 PA) than he did at Coors Field (.761 OPS in 111 PA).  The sample sizes are probably too small to draw any major conclusions, of course, but naturally the Rockies are hoping for more consistent production from Bryant at his new home ballpark.</p>",

Meanwhile, Bae, who as I said on Twitter last night looks like the most athletic member of a K-Pop group (that hair is fabulous), got his first Major League ribbies in the fifth inning after Ben Gamel walked and Greg Allen reached on a fielder’s choice, doubling them both in and earning this nickname from Pirates Twitter:</p>\n\n\n<p>Ji Hwan Slay pic.twitter.com/nozO30dKUB</p>— Pittsburgh Pirates (@Pirates) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Cubs starter Wade Miley left the game shortly thereafter with a tweaked oblique, and Jack Suwinski pinch-hit for Diego Castillo—and did this: </p>\n\n\n<p>Jack Suwinski loves hitting at PNC!! pic.twitter.com/tkHFnVVqPl</p>— Pittsburgh Pirates (@Pirates) September 25, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Jack-Jack’s now tied with Jason Bay for the most home runs by a rookie at home. </p>\n<p>And that was all the offense needed. Zach Thompson came on in relief and did his job, a welcome sight after the bullpen’s recent woes. I would also point out that neither Oneil Cruz (day off) or Ke’Bryan Hayes (still dealing with an injury) were in the lineup. Yeah, true, the Cubs aren’t that great, but after the debacle of the New York road trip and faltering against the Cubs the  last two games, this win was badly needed—and a lot of fun to watch.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

The interview was recorded March 5, 2013 just hours after the news of the death of Hugo Chavez. Gravel was a man of principle who used his position in the US Senate to fight against the draft and the War in Vietnam, and who famously used used his filibuster to read the Pentagon Papers into the congressional record, thereby making the revelations about US crimes in Vietnam US historical fact, rather than something consigned to history books. Mike was an anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist though he never used those terms. He cared deeply about ordinary working class folks, and he believed it was his duty to help regular people understand that democracy is the goal rather than something already existing. </p>\n<p>Rest in peace Mike.

First, Eric and Paul go in depth on how the pandemic is a direct result of capitalist development and ecocide, and the fact that Trump's base is only interested in white nationalism and authoritarianism. The second half of the show is a post-mortem of the Bernie Sanders campaign as Eric and Paul discuss what went wrong, and whether or not Bernie represents the final nail in the coffin of the \"transforming the Democratic Party\" mantra. Finally, Paul gives his inside perspective on what happened at Truthdig and why independent left media is so critical in these crazy times. </p>\n<p>Music: The Mekons - \"Simone\"   More</p>\n<p>The post Paul Street – Episode 149 appeared first on CounterPunch.org.</p>",

From there, Michael explains why Keynesians are wrong in describing \"demand crises\" when really it's supply crises that drive economic downturns, and why comparisons of 2020 and 1987 fall flat. The second half of the episode explores the role of oil price collapse and corporate debt in exacerbating the coming depression, and the material reality of life for workers under the dire economic conditions we now face.

From there the interview touches on how Trump and fascists use language, the precarity of truth in a fascist era, and the question of whether Trump represents a unique threat or simply the removal of the white supremacist mask.

JP gives his astute analysis of the Democratic candidates, the electoral map, and changes in American politics that he foresees. The last portion of the discussion focuses on the Smollett case, and how it relates to broader sociopolitical questions of America in 2019. </p>\n<p>Music: Nouvelle Vague - \"Guns of Brixton\" More</p>\n<p>The post JP Sottile – Episode 124 appeared first on CounterPunch.org.</p>",

The conversation begins with an exploration of Jewish society and the distinctions between liberal Zionists and the right-wing Zionists, the importance of the Israeli legal system in upholding apartheid, and much more. Ronnie provides some critical insights into nuances of Israeli law and society to highlight how deep the brainwashing and propaganda of the Israeli state has penetrated. Eric and Ronnie discuss the recent passage of the Israeli \"Nationality Law\" and what it means for the future of Arab-Israelis and, especially, Palestinians both in Palestine and the diaspora. Ronnie also explores the importance of Ahed Tamimi, and how her heroic resistance has led to a crisis in Israeli social discourse. Finally, Ronnie provides an update on the current state of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, and how it is impacting the situation in Palestine. All this and so much more in this wide-ranging discussion. </p>\n<p>Music: Devo - \"Freedom of Choice\"<br />\n More</p>\n<p>The post Ronnie Barkan – Episode 111 appeared first on CounterPunch.org.</p>",

Margot was a brilliant spokesperson for the underdog and the dispossessed, who cared deeply about wilderness and the fate of the planet. Margie was also my friend, and one of the most generous, hilarious, smart and beautiful people I have ever met. Margie enjoyed a successful career acting, known, in particular, for her role as Lois Lane in the Superman Series alongside Christopher Reeves.</p>\n<p>This interview was done in December, 2016, shortly after Margie returned from unprecedented protests at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota, aimed at stopping a pipeline from being built under the Missouri River. Within a week of this interview, the Trump administration ordered the razing of the protest site, forcible removal of all remaining protesters, and completion of the pipeline.</p>\n<p>The time then did not seem ripe to publish this piece, but Margie passed in May, 2018, and I feel that others could be empowered and inspired by her perspectives and experience at the protest. She offers insights here that have not been covered in the press. Margie shares a powerful and clear vision for improving our relations with each other, and the importance of challenging the dominant role of the extractive energy industry and tackling perhaps the most important problem of our time: climate change.

While Jeff and Eric record from deep in their respective strongholds, Josh remains foolishly above ground, open to the elements and nuclear bombs. Nevertheless, the show must go on, so Eric, Jeff and Josh discuss everything from Trump's bombs over Syria to Putinmania, from Democratic Party orcs to the Great Syria Meme War of 2017. The guys discuss CounterPunch's close encounters with fake news and fake personas, the fractures and/or collapse of the Left, the total evisceration of regulatory agencies under Trump, and why the Degenerate-in-Chief is more like Bill Clinton than Barack Obama or George Bush. This was a fun conversation, don't miss it! </p>\n<p>Music: Jackson Browne - \"Lawyers in Love\" More</p>\n<p>The post Jeffrey St. Clair &amp; Joshua Frank – Episode 100 appeared first on CounterPunch.org.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This week Eric chats with Brazil-based journalist Mike Fox about the ongoing protests against the right wing government, the volatile politics of the country, Brazil's significance to the region, and much more. The conversation begins with an in-depth analysis of the recent scandals that continue to plague the Temer government, and what this means in the near- and long-term.  Eric and Mike discuss the manufactured nature of the protests against the left wing government of Dilma Rousseff, and the role of big capital both in Brazil and the US in bankrolling them. The second half of the show highlights the broader implications for Latin America, and places Brazil in its proper regional and international context. From urban and rural protests to the role of Wall Street, from endemic corruption to the dangerous Trump Administration, Eric and Mike tackle this complex topic this week on CounterPunch Radio!</p>\n<p>Music: Max Romeo - \"Socialism Is Love\"  More</p>\n<p>The post Mike Fox – Episode 88 appeared first on CounterPunch.org.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This week in a special edition of CounterPunch Radio, environmental activist and CounterPunch contributor Louisa Willcox welcomes two unsung environmental heroes, Jim and Heidi Barrett, who were leaders in a campaign that took on – and won – one of the biggest environmental victories in the history of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Against all odds, this modest couple and their small grassroots group in the hamlet of Cooke City, MT, along with allies, took on Noranda, one of the largest mining companies in the world, which aimed to build a massive gold mine near the border of Yellowstone Park. The conversation begins with their recounting this David versus Goliath battle that resulted in permanent protection of a fragile, wild area that is home to imperiled grizzlies, wolves, and countless other species. In the second half of this conversation, Jim and Heidi discuss their work to bring under control the escalating and damaging use of off-road vehicles on public lands. And they share their efforts to improve sanitation in an area that had long been a “black hole for bears” because widely available garbage had caused so many threatened grizzly bears to be killed. Along the way, Jim and Heidi share lessons they learned that can strengthen environmental campaigns in these dark times.  Their work underscores the fact that a few people with big hearts and grit can make an immeasurable difference for the wild -- and all of us. All this and more in this week’s CounterPunch Radio.<br />\n​<br />\nFor more on Jim and Heidi and the efforts to reduce conflicts with grizzly bears around Cooke City, see Louisa's blog.

The conversation begins with an in-depth examination of the forces that propelled Trump into the White House, with Arun relaying his experiences talking with white workers in Indiana and around the country. From there the discussion shifts to Trump as the liberal trauma and whether or not it could lead to a political awakening. The last part of the show focuses on Nazi punching, riots, Black Bloc, and the merits of violence both as a tactic and as a means to a political end.

From there, the conversation probes some uncomofortable questions about the current state of anti-war and anti-imperialist causes, and what that tells us about the political reality of 2017. From the rise of fascism throughout the Western world to the Syria question and the nature of resistance in the era of Trump, Eric and Ben tread some rather uneasy territory in hopes of understanding what we're witnessing around us, and charting a path forward for the Left.

Additionally, the conversation goes in depth on Fukushima, the health and environmental impacts of nuclear power, alternative sources of energy, and the responsibility of activists for having brought us to this point, and further into the future.

Robbie Martin has an answer, and it connects to Rudy Giuliani and the neocons' corporate ties with the military-industrial complex.

Eric and Nick explore the history of CIA manipulation of the media going back decades, and how it has evolved into the propaganda consensus we see today.  The conversation touches on everything from Nicaragua and the Reagan counter-revolution to the sycophantic relationship between Hollywood and Langley.  From Robert Parry to Robert Kagan, from South Vietnam to Baghdad, the story of CIA information warfare is a long and sordid one, and Schou's new book is an important contribution in telling it. </p>\n<p>Musical Interlude: Wire - I Am the Fly   More</p>\n<p>The post Nicholas Schou – Episode 52 appeared first on CounterPunch.org.</p>",

Eric and Madhusree also bring the issues forward our time by probing how the same agricultural policies, engendered by capitalism and profit, are helping to exacerbate poverty, dispossession, and environmental degradation today.

Eric and Don discuss the state of the independent media, and how it has been rapidly transformed in recent years.  Don presents an inside account of the corporate takeover and purge of Pacifica Radio and its NYC flagship station WBAI, pulling back the curtain on how Pacifica operates, and why some of its good work has come to be overshadowed by the bad, especially when it comes to issues of war and peace. Eric and Don also touch on the war in Libya and how that exposed much of the media for being aligned with the US-NATO war agenda. </p>\n<p>In the second half of the show, Eric welcomes Laura Carlsen, Director of the Americas Program at the Center for International Policy to the program.  Eric and Laura discuss the 2014 Ayotzinapa massacre of student teachers in Mexico, and the obvious government cover-up of the incident. Laura explains what happened in late September 2014, what the circumstances were leading up to the massacre, and the inconsistencies in the initial government investigation.  Eric and Laura also discuss neoliberalism and privatization, and how this massacre should be understood as part of a broader political process ongoing in Mexico with direct US involvement. </p>\n<p>Musical interlude from Boukman Eksperyans - \"Jou Nou Revolte\"<br />\nIntro &amp; Outtro from David Vest More</p>\n<p>The post Don DeBar &amp; Laura Carlsen – Episode 22 appeared first on CounterPunch.org.</p>",

In the first half of the episode, Eric chats with award winning syndicated political cartoonist and author Ted Rall about the controversy surrounding his recent firing by the LA Times on bogus charges made by the LAPD.  Eric and Ted discuss the circumstances of his firing, the LAPD's lies, and the stupidity and arrogance of LA Times management in siding with the cops.  Eric and Ted examine the larger context of this story, including how it is an indictment of the corporate media which, once again, reveals itself as a servant of power.  Ted also talks about his brand new book about NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, scheduled for release in a few days.</p>\n<p>In the second part of the episode, Eric welcomes environmental journalist and regular CounterPunch contributor Robert Hunziker to the program to discuss climate change and the precarious state of our planet.  Robert and Eric talk about the state of the arctic, the terrifying implications of the loss of arctic sea ice and methane release, and much more.

        "description": "<p>support this podcast, donate today</p>\n<p>In Episode 4 of CounterPunch Radio host Eric Draitser has an in depth conversation with analyst and commentator Yvette Carnell, founder of the popular website BreakingBrown.com.  Yvette discusses her recent article in CounterPunch entitled \"The White Terrorists: Lynching in America,\" which attempts to pull back the curtain on some of the hidden history of lynching and its social, cultural, and economic underpinnings.  Eric and Yvette discuss the \"pathologizing\" of blackness in America and the impact that it has had on both perceptions of Black people, and their own perceptions of themselves.  Additionally, they attempt to draw out the connection between the lynchings of the past and the violence and police murders of today, with particular attention to the socio-cultural context within which these should be examined.  All this and more on Ep. 4 of CouterPunch Radio. Intro and outtro music provided by the Dr. of the Blues, the man with a PhD in Boogie Woogie, David Vest.

        "description": "<p>My eponymous co-blogger Eugene Volokh has called attention to a case that involves the question whether a bumble bee is a \"fish\" for purposes of a California statute. This kind of problem of surprising statutory scope comes up often (mischief rule to the rescue!). This particular case brought to mind a pithy case I sometimes teach in Remedies. It's Knox v. Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 407 (Mass. App. Ct. 1981), and is in the declaratory judgment chapter in the remedies casebook that Emily Sherwin and I are the editors of (Ames, Chafee, and Re on Remedies).</p>\n<p>Knox raises the question whether goldfish count as \"animals\" under a Massachusetts statute. The court decides yes: \"We merely conclude, in interpreting this humane statute designed to protect animals subject to possible neglect by prizewinners, that [it] applies to goldfish.\" The reason it's a remedies case is that it illustrates the kind of situation for which the declaratory judgment is apt, because the parties need an uncertainty clarified, and once it is clarified, they do not need further direction and management by the court.</p>\n<p>The post Are Bumble Bees Fish? Are Fish Animals? appeared first on Reason.com.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Richard Rodriguez/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>Call him SpongeBob, call him Oscar, just don’t call him late on pitches</p> <p>Maybe the Guardians are just used to 8 p.m. starts. After three straight, they finally played one at 7 p.m. again tonight, but the offense forgot to show up until an hour into the game. Yet, despite being no-hit by Glenn Otto through four innings, they came back to win, 4-2, thanks to Oscar Gonzalez’s slump-busting power outburst. </p>\n<p>Gonzalez, who hadn’t homered since Sept. 14 coming into the game, hit two tonight. His first broke up the improbable no-hitter in the fifth inning, and was hit a few rows into Globe Life Park’s left-field bleachers at a measly 99.1 mph. The second was hit at 110.4 mph and went 433 feet to straight away center field, according to Statcast. The video makes it look like it barely cleared the 407-foot wall, but every Rangers camera is in the stratosphere so it’s hard to tell any kind of distance over there. </p>\n\n<p>Andrés Giménez would add to the dinger party in the seventh with his 17th of the season. He also added a double earlier in the game for his fourth multi-extra-base-hit game of the year. He’s also riding a six-game hitting streak, and he also has four multi-hit games in that span. He’s been the definition of a quiet superstar this season, especially lately. </p>\n<p>If there was one downside to this game, it’s that José Ramírez looked generally awful at the plate. The Rangers intentionally walked him in the eighth and they probably did him a favor. Even more concerning, Texas pitchers had a very clear path to attack him — throw him everything away. Luckily he didn’t swing at most of them, but when he did swing it was an easy out. </p>\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \n<p>Take it as a positive that they’re still afraid to give him anything over the plate, I guess, but it was still just a frustrating day offensively for the All-Star. Still plenty of time to get things right before the postseason, however. </p>\n<p>On the mound, Cal Quantrill managed to go toe-to-toe with the pitching juggernaut known as Glenn Otto. He struck out four in his six innings of work, allowing one earned run off of five hits and three walks. Cal rode his signature cutter/sinker combination to the win, with the pair accounting for 69 of his 83 pitches. </p>\n<p>Emmanuel Clase would close out the game in the ninth, but maybe it’s time to let the big man have a break for a couple of days. He gave up a home run in the save — just his third of the season and first since July — and he’s pitched four times in the last four days. Even when he’s escaped unscathed lately he hasn’t looked like the unhittable machine that he was for long stretches of the season. The division is all but wrapped up at this point, maybe it’s time to give the howitzer time to cool off before the games start counting again. </p>\n<p>Regardless, the Guardians took the win and they’ll have a chance to clinch the AL Central with a win tomorrow, thanks to the Tigers once again taking it to the White Sox. All the Guardians have to do is take care of their business and they’ll officially be postseason bound. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said on Saturday that she will not vote for Harriet Hageman, the Republican nominee for Wyoming’s at-large House seat, in November’s election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hageman, who was endorsed by former President Trump, defeated Cheney in the state’s Republican primary in August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She’s sworn an oath to the Constitution as a member of the Wyoming State Bar,” Cheney told Texas Tribune CEO Evan Smith at the paper’s 2022 festival. “And she continues to make the assertion that somehow the 2020 election was stolen. … I know that she knows better.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There are many people around this country who are making claims they know not to be true, and I don’t think anybody should vote for any of them,” she added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The congresswoman pointed to Kari Lake, the Republican nominee for governor in Arizona, as an example of another “dangerous” candidate that has denied the results of the 2020 election. Cheney said she will do everything she can to ensure that Lake is not elected, including campaigning with Democrats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In this election you have to vote for the person who actually believes in democracy,” she said. “And that is just crucial, because if we elect election deniers, if we elect people who said that they’re not going to certify results or who are going to try to steal elections, then we really are putting the Republic at risk.”</p>",

        "description": "Jamie Sabau-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>Drew Hutchison was his usual decent self, but the top half of the lineup really got it done once again. </p> <p>Another good performance from the top of the lineup and a well played game overall saw the Tigers take their second in a row over the White Sox by a score of 7-2 on Saturday night.</p>\n<p>The Tigers offense once again got out to a quick start in this one against White Sox’ rookie Davis Martin. The 25-year-old right-hander showed a pretty good fastball and a solid pair of breaking balls, but his command failed him a few times and quality AB’s from the Tigers allowed them to take advantage. </p>\n<p>Riley Greene singled to lead off the game, and was replaced at first by Báez, who grounded into a force at second. Harold Castro followed in the three-hole, and delivered with his seventh long ball of the season to stake Hutchison and his club to an early lead. Castro, Báez, and Greene would all go on to post three-hit games in this one.</p>\n<p>Martin did a good job keeping the Tigers in check from there, with a two out double by Jeimer Candelario in the fourth marking the only baserunner to get beyond first base until the fifth. </p>\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>Homerin' Harold says hello. pic.twitter.com/EiZmuvJjn4</p>— Detroit Tigers (@tigers) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>We’re not going to oversell Drew Hutchison, as he’s still decidedly in fifth starter territory at his best. However, despite a lack of overpowering stuff, he continues to show a veteran’s composure in staying calm and getting a strikeout or ground ball to escape trouble. After a quick first inning with just a walk allowed, Hutchison got in a bit of trouble when AJ Pollock singled with one out in the second inning. Yasmani Grandal flew out routinely to center, but Mark Payton drew a walk to move Pollock into scoring position, and once again, Hutchison induced a routine ground ball to Javier Báez to escape. </p>\n<p>If there was a key to his start, it was that Hutchison only allowed the leadoff man to reach in the fourth inning, when Eloy Jimenez blasted a solo home run to get the White Sox on the board. Gavin Sheets followed by hammering a first pitch slider for another home run, as the Sox dialed in against Hutchison’s first pitch slider, which he was using pretty often to keep pressure off the fastball and steal early strikes. </p>\n<p>After Hutchison allowed the two home runs to open the bottom of the fourth, he had to dig deep. Pollock followed Sheets’ blast with a double to left. A Grandal ground out moved Pollock to third, and AJ Hinch brought the infield in against Mark Payton. It worked out perfectly, as Payton slapped a sharp grounder to Harold Castro at second. Harold fired home and Barnhart ran down Pollock with ease for the second out. More drama was required, so Hutch then nicked Josh Harrison with a fastball, but Elvis Andrus grounded out to end the inning.</p>\n<p>With an adjustment made, Hutchison tossed a quick 1-2-3 fifth inning to end his night with 2 ER, 4 H, 2 BB, SO allowed. Not particularly good, but his ability to avoid rallies continues to serve him in good stead. </p>\n<p>The Tigers’ offense continues to show real signs of life down the stretch, and they quickly recaptured the lead in the top of the fifth. Greene and Báez each drilled fly balls to right field for singles, though Báez was gunned down by Gavin Sheets after his drive was played perfectly off the wall by the White Sox right fielder. Harold Castro dumped a single into left to score Greene, and it was 3-2, all runs courtesy of Harold RBI’s. </p>\n<p>Both clubs went quickly in the sixth, as Alex Lange spun a quick bottom half for the Tigers. Then it was time to blow this game open.</p>\n<p>Veteran lefty Jake Diekman took over from Martin in the top of the seventh, and it did not go well for him. Barnhart led off with a single, and then Akil Baddoo reached on a bunt toward first base. Riley Greene drilled a hard ground ball single back up the middle to score Barnhart, and Javier Báez, enjoying the lavish attention from White Sox’ fans as usual, launched a drive to right field for his 15th home run on the season. 7-2 Tigers.</p>\n\n\n<p>Riley Greene gets his third hit and first RBI of the game as the #Tigers take a 4-2 lead in the 7th! #DetroitRoots @Greene21Riley | @Tucker_Barnhart pic.twitter.com/LLtHEA8exF</p>— Bally Sports Detroit (@BallySportsDET) September 25, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Javier Báez blows this game open with a three-run blast and it's 7-2 #Tigers in the 7th! #DetroitRoots@javy23baez | @AkilBaddoo | @Greene21Riley pic.twitter.com/3PEDPu6Evg</p>— Bally Sports Detroit (@BallySportsDET) September 25, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Also, lmao.

Up and down, but putting together some extremely dynamic stretches where he looks in prime form. He now holds a 110 wRC+ since the All-Star break. Not ideal, but combined with continued quality defense, it will have to do. We might just wish that Al Avila had gotten a better price, or a shorter term. New President of Baseball Operations, Scott Harris, knows Báez well from their time with the Cubs, so hopefully he and AJ can get the best out of him going forward.</p>\n<p>Will Vest handled the bottom of the seventh against the now somewhat deflated White Sox. Garrett Hill spun a pretty snappy eighth, and it was last call.</p>\n<p>Báez led off the top of the ninth with a line drive single to left for his third knock of the night, but the Tigers couldn’t score him. That left it to Hill and his newfound velocity out of the pen (hitting 96 mph) to close this one out with a five-run lead. He did so with relative ease other than a walk to Payton, and the Tigers had a series victory.</p>\n<p>It’s good they won this one, as LHP Tyler Alexander will take on AL Cy Young contender Dylan Cease at 2:05 p.m. EDT on Sunday.</p>\n<p></p>\nErie SeaWolves take Game 1 of the Eastern League championships\n<p>Starter Wilmer Flores didn’t have his best outing, surrendering a pair of early runs across four innings of work, but the SeaWolves’ offense battled back from multiple deficits to win 6-5. They need one more victory to win it all. The series will now move to Somerset starting on Monday night.</p>\n<p>The heroes were Gage Workman, who came through with a pair of clutch knocks for a four RBI night including a two-run homer, and Parker Meadows, who posted a three-hit game including a sixth inning double that started a furious rally, and the SeaWolves bullpen. Lefty Brant Hurter struggled in middle relief of Flores, but the late innings relief corps came up huge as Elvis Alvarado, Andrew Magno, and Gerson Moreno dominated the final three innings to make the slim lead hold up.</p>\n<p>Gage Workman folks. Strikes out a ton, but seems to do huge damage every time his bat finds the ball.</p>\n\n\n<p>Gage Workman with an absolute nuke to center field.

        "description": "Photo by David Berding/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>In a game I definitely watched, the Twins had more runs.</p> <p>You can’t prove I didn’t watch this game.</p>\n<p>You can’t! That’s the beauty of plausible deniability. (Look it up; I’m sure it applies here, and not just on television procedurals that illuminate the sordid lives of naval court officials, and the cases they’re prosecuting.)</p>\n<p>Now, I know what you’re thinking.</p>\n<p>It stands to reason that there are other things I could have been doing at the same time as the baseball contest between the Minnesota Twins and the Los Angeles Angels, who were playing a game in the Warehouse District this evening, despite gloomy conditions and pervasively early darkness.</p>\n<p>For example, I could have been making chicken soup while watching Simon Anthony solve a chess-based Sudoku variant puzzle. It’s a 90-minute video, indicating average- to above-average difficulty for the channel, whose focus is usually on dastardly set-ups submitted by professional constructors and rabid fans alike.</p>\n<p>But if I had, I certainly wouldn’t have known that Gary Sanchez hit his first home run in about 20 days, now would I? Here’s a clip, for proof! How would I have known that this clip was from tonight if I hadn’t seen it happen with my own two eyes?</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Sanchez tallied four RBI on the night; other facts include that Joe Ryan threw just four innings (he wasn’t his usual self), but was backed up by three-hit performances from both Jose Miranda and Gio Urshela, the latter of which scored a pair of runs (as did Luis Arraez.) These facts have been brought to you by my own two eyeballs, both of which visually took in the baseball game that I’m describing.</p>\n<p>It’s things like this that I wouldn’t have known if the game was simply on in the background while I finally did some long-needed cleanup on my Goodreads account; now things are a lot more organized and it’s much clearer which books I will be spending my time on next. Or, I should say, it will be much clearer, when I take a look at that website now that the baseball game I just watched is over. I watched it in my living room.</p>\n<p>If I had merely been getting a few loads of laundry done, folding the newly-dried articles and cycling the more summery outfits out of the open closet space and into a nearby dresser, I definitely wouldn’t have remembered that the bullpen backed up Ryan’s short performance with a combined shutout effort (excepting a run allowed by Jhoan Duran in the visiting ninth.)</p>\n<p>I mean, I never would have noticed that.</p>\n<p>In the immortal words of Nickelback, look at this graph:</p>\n  \n        \n      \nCOURTESY: Baseball Savant\n  \n<p></p>\n<p>When I saw this, I said (out loud!) “Yep, that is how the game happened!”</p>\n<p>STUDS:</p>\n<p>The players who did a really good job</p>\n<p>DUDS:</p>\n<p>Trick question. There aren’t duds when the Twins win (ever heard of “No duds, Twins win”?)</p>\n<p>ROBOT ROLL CALL:</p>\n<p>Presumably, everyone was here tonight! I didn’t get a chance to do a head count.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tune in again tomorrow afternoon, where tens of thousands in the metro area will also definitely be watching that game as well, and definitely not the Minnesota Vikings game happening around the same time.</p>\n\n<p>See you soon!</p>",

Graham Ashcraft left a slider over the middle of the plate, and Renfroe blasted it into the second deck in left field to make it a 2-1 Brewers lead.</p>\n\n\n<p>Hunter's sending baseballs into Kentucky.#ThisIsMyCrew pic.twitter.com/IUNDtUXAm5</p>— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>The Brewers weren’t done in the fourth. Omar Narvaez and Tyrone Taylor each added RBI singles to make it 4-1.</p>\n<p>Renfroe homered again in the following inning. This one was a 360-foot wall scraper for another two-run shot, making it 6-1.</p>\n\n\n<p>Hunter's giving out souvenirs in Cincy.#ThisIsMyCrew pic.twitter.com/KmIujBvxF1</p>— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 25, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Milwaukee continued to pour it on offensively, adding four more runs in the top of the seventh to make it 9-1.</p>\n<p>Willy Adames hit a ground ball that deflected off third baseman Spencer Steer’s glove. That slowed the ball down enough to allow Christian Yelich to score from first while Adames coasted into second with a double.</p>\n<p>After Adames took third on a flyout by Rowdy Tellez, Renfroe drove him in with a base hit to left. Luis Urias eventually plated him with a base hit of his own.</p>\n<p>That was enough run support for Corbin Burnes, who settled down after a 30-pitch first inning to work 6 1⁄3 innings of two-run ball. Burnes allowed four hits, walked three, and struck out eight.</p>\n<p>A walk and two singles forced him out of the game with two men on and one out in the seventh, but Trevor Gott stranded both runners to keep the score at 9-2.</p>\n<p>Rowdy Tellez further padded the lead with a solo shot off infielder Alejo Lopez, who pitched the ninth inning for the Reds.</p>\n\n\n<p>Rowdy bombs are always fun.#ThisIsMyCrew pic.twitter.com/6HFLJltPp8</p>— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 25, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Taylor Rogers and Brent Suter each worked scoreless innings out of the bullpen to seal the win.</p>\n<p>Because the Phillies lost to the Braves earlier today, the Brewers are now 2.5 games out of a playoff spot.</p>\n<p>The Crew will go for the sweep tomorrow behind Freddy Peralta, who is making his return from the injured list. Nick Lodolo, who struck out 11 Brewers in eight innings earlier this month, starts for the Reds. First pitch is scheduled for 12:40 p.m. CDT.</p>",

        "description": "Photo by Megan Briggs/Getty Images\n    \n\n  <p>The Fish beat the Nats for the 15th time this season.</p> <p>Miami, FL—The Miami Marlins went up against the Washington Nationals on Saturday looking to win the series. It was Sandy Alcantara v. Erick Fedde as LoanDepot Park celebrated World Baseball Classic Day in possibly Sandy’s final home start of 2022. With his Cy Young tour nearing its end, Sandy gave Marlins fans another great performance. </p>\n<p>Prior to the game, there was a ceremony held in Section 29 unveiling the 2023 World Baseball Classic mural with WBC alum, J.P. Arencibia (USA), Nelson Cruz (Dominican Republic), and others. J.P. described this as a great moment and “that there is no better place to put every round of the World Baseball Classic other than in Miami, Florida.” </p>\n\n\n<p>World Baseball Classic Mural has been revealed. #Marlins #WorldBaseballClassic pic.twitter.com/cFLFXROYGj</p>— Kevin Barral (@kevin_barral) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The Nationals offense got it going quickly as 1st baseman Joey Meneses hit a solo homer with two outs in the top of the 1st. He had commented to the media the day prior that Sandy was the pitcher that he has had the most trouble facing, but Meneses became the only Nats hitter to homer off of him this season. Nationals lead, 1-0. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Thankfully, the Marlins offense came right back and scored a run of their own. The rally began with a Brian Anderson single, Garrett Cooper walked, and then a JJ Bleday single drove in both Anderson and Cooper to not only tie the game but give the Fish the lead. Marlins up, 2-1. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The hottest hitter on the Marlins has been Bryan De La Cruz with a slash line of .317/.383/.585/.986 in the month of September and he stayed hot with a solo homer to dead center. Marlins extend their lead, 3-1.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The Marlins offense got it going again in the 6th inning with singles by DLC and Jacob Stallings, followed by Miguel Rojas hitting an RBI double. Marlins lead, 4-1. </p>\n<p>This 4th run would mark the end of the night for Erick Fedde, who was once considered a “Marlins Killer.” He went winless in his matchups with the Fish this season, averaging barely 5 innings per start. </p>\n<p>Final Line: 5.2 IP, 9 H, 4 R, 4 ER, 1 BB, 4 SO, 1 HR, 94 NP, 5.34 ERA</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p></p>\n<p>Sandy Alcantara’s night came to a close 3 innings later. He was throwing gas up to 101 MPH, helping him get his 6th double-digit strikeout game of the season. Sandy is only one strikeout away from 200 overall. Dominant as usual, he just gave the baseball writers one more reason to vote for him to win the National League Cy Young. </p>\n<p>“It’s always hard because I don’t want to leave the game,” Sandy told the media postgame. He went on to mention that 99 pitches thrown “is nothing” and that he could have completed the game himself if manager Don Mattingly gave him the opportunity.</p>\n<p>Final Line: 8.0 IP, 3 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 11, SO, 1 HR, 99 NP, 2.32 ERA</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p></p>\n<p>After Sandy was removed, Dylan Floro closed it out in 1-2-3 fashion to give Miami the 4-1 victory. The Marlins have a 15-3 record against the Nationals this season. </p>\n<p>For Sunday’s series finale, Edward Cabrera will be out on the mound to face off against former Marlin Aníbal Sánchez. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

        "description": "James A. Pittman-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>The Astros defeated the Orioles by an 11-10 final score in Camden Yards.</p> <p></p>\n<p>On their third try, the Houston Astros won their 100th game of the 2022 season, but it didn’t come easy. It’s the fifth time that Houston has reached the triple-digit plateau, and the fourth time in the past five (full) seasons. Box Score</p>\n<p>Framber Valdez answered the call for his 29th start of the season, and failed to earn his 17th victory to tie Justin Verlander for the American League lead. He was opposed by Mike Baumann (1-3, 4.29) in just his second career start. </p>\n<p>After two scoreless innings on each side, Jose Altuve got the Astros on the board first with his 26th home run of the season. It’s the third time he’s reached the total through his career, and with his 190th home run overall, he’s reached number 395 on the all-time list to tie with Glenn Davis. </p>\n\n\n<p>Tuve adds two. pic.twitter.com/TxDBtP7fhd</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>In the fourth, the Orioles fought back for five runs, on a Rougned Odor two-RBI-single, a Jorge Mateo RBI-groundout, and a Cedric Mullins (15) two-run home run for a 5-2 lead.</p>\n<p>Unlike the past two games, Houston’s offense did not remain silent. After the Astros loaded the bases with one out, Jeremy Peña hit a two-run single to cut Baltimore’s lead to one run. Yordan Alvarez tied it in the next at bat with an RBI-single. Alex Bregman’s sacrifice fly got the lead back for them, 6-5. </p>\n<p>Despite Valdez’ rocky start, he entered the bottom of the fifth inning in line to be the winning pitcher of record if the Orioles didn’t score again. Unfortunately, Anthony Santander (28) led off with a homer to tie the game at six. This time, there was no pulling of Valdez’ chestnuts off the fire by Houston’s offense. </p>\n<p>Valdez opened the sixth by surrendering a single and a walk, and Dusty Baker actually kept him in the game after visiting the mound. His loyalty was not rewarded when Valdez lost the lead two batters later on a Ryan Mountcastle RBI-single for a 7-6 Baltimore lead. I understand that Dusty wanted to leave him in so he could extend his record streak, but the writing was on the wall for a few innings already. </p>\n<p>Valdez was finally pulled in favor of Phil Maton at that point. Valdez failed to get a Quality Start, allowing seven runs (four earned) on 11 hits and a walk over 5 1⁄3 innings. He struck out six and got 63-of-103 pitches over the plate. </p>\n<p>The score remained one run in Baltimore’s favor until the eighth inning, when Yuli Gurriel tied it at 7-apiece with an RBI-double.</p>\n\n\n<p>Cuban connection. pic.twitter.com/XHlBlWvp5i</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 25, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>Santander answered the bell for Baltimore in the bottom of the eighth with a two-run home run, leading off against new reliever Rafael Montero for a 9-7 lead. </p>\n<p>Down to possibly their last chance, Houston led off the ninth with a Christian Vázquez single and an Altuve walk. After Aledmys Díaz flew out to center field, Alvarez added a single to load the bases. Bregman grounded into a fielder’s choice, knocking in Vázquez and trimming the lead to one for Kyle Tucker.</p>\n\n\n<p>IF NOBODY GOT ME... pic.twitter.com/L4SneyUIHX</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 25, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>After Tucker tied it up, Bregman was standing on third with the go-ahead run for Gurriel. </p>\n\n\n<p>STROS TAKE THE LEAD. pic.twitter.com/Krr9knzFLJ</p>— Houston Astros (@astros) September 25, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>With a brand-sparkling-new 11-9 lead, the Astros called on Ryan Pressly to close the deal. After he gave up a leadoff homer to Odor (13), he got the rest of the side out to earn his 31st save of the season.</p>\n  \n        \n  \n<p>That was just a circus. An offensive circus, and a real relief after enduring two straight shutouts to these boys. The Astros look to close the series tomorrow with a split. </p>\n<p></p>",

I can think of at least five pitches off the top of my head that were in the white box on the TV broadcast but were called balls. That includes one pitch starter Kris Bubic threw which should have led to a strikeout and the plate appearance instead ended in a walk.</p>\n<p>Kris Bubic, as you might have imagined, was a great offender, tonight. He walked four and struck out six in his 4.2 innings pitched. However, Colin Snider and Brad Keller each walked a pair without striking anyone out. Carlos Hernández also walked one. Hernández and Keller each had to escape bases-loaded situations late in the game. That they managed to do so while only giving up a single run speaks more to the Mariners' failures than the Royals’ successes.</p>\n<p>Kris Bubic only had one pitch working tonight, and it was his curveball. He managed to keep the scoring from getting out of hand solely because when he was missing his spots, he was doing it outside the strike zone. Unfortunately, that also led to him topping 100 pitches without escaping the fifth inning. That placed a large burden on the bullpen which couldn’t keep up the pace they had established earlier on the homestand.</p>\n<p>Vinnie Pasquantino did hit another dinger, at least. So let’s take a look at that.</p>\n\n\n<p>Clobbagool.#TogetherRoyal pic.twitter.com/fFKgE2xhLN</p>— Kansas City Royals (@Royals) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nI was right about Logan Gilbert being due to give up some runs, but wrong about how the Royals would do it. Extra base hits were the order of the day.\nThe TV broadcast had new Executive Vice President J.J. Picollo on to talk about the changes coming to KC, and he reemphasized the importance of analytics and their usage in modern baseball. That was nice to hear.\nThe Royals will have another shot to guarantee fewer than 100 losses on the season tomorrow.\nDuring the broadcast, the crew pondered whether Bobby Witt Jr. or Nate Eaton were faster. Announcer Ryan LeFebvre declared confidently that Witt is the faster of the two. According to Baseball Savant, he’s right. Witt Jr. clocks in at the 100th percentile. Don’t sleep on Eaton’s speed, though, he’s sitting at the 97th percentile. \nWhile Witt might be faster, Eaton might be the better base-stealer. Witt has stolen 28 in 141 games but Eaton has stolen 10 in only 36.\n\n<p>Tomorrow will be a matchup of Castillos. Trade deadline acquisition and the most recent addition to the lucrative contract extension club Luis Castillo will take the mound for the Mariners. Promising rookie Max Castillo will go for KC. The game will start at 1:10 PM CDT.</p>",

(credit: Samuel Axon)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For the past couple of years, Apple’s annual iOS updates have laser focused on one feature for an overhaul while making smaller tweaks to everything else. Last year, Focus was the, well, focus. The year before that, it was the home screen.</p>\n<p>This time it’s the lock screen. You can now change fonts, add widgets, customize the information displayed, and pick from a wider variety of wallpaper. Apple has also more deeply integrated the lock screen with the Focus modes that were fleshed out in iOS 15. And it has laid the groundwork for something more than just notifications that third-party apps can show you before you unlock your phone.</p>\n<p>Given the increasingly iterative nature of iOS releases today—with many key features not arriving until months after the initial ship date of a new, whole-numbered version—we’re moving to leaner initial iOS reviews, with updates to come in additional articles over time. So today we’re going to look at the main new feature of iOS 16, but we’ll touch on a couple of other key features and changes, too.</p><p>Read 68 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

A new Fitbit help page has outlined the plan for the coming Google account migration. If this goes anything like the Nest account migrations (done by the same Google Hardware division), Fitbit users are in for a wild ride.</p>\n<p>Google's support page says, \"We plan to enable use of Fitbit with a Google account sometime in 2023\" and that at that point \"some uses of Fitbit will require a Google account, including to sign up for Fitbit or activate newly released Fitbit devices and features.\" That means optional account migrations for existing users in 2023. Google also says, \"Support of Fitbit accounts will continue until at least early 2025. After support of Fitbit accounts ends, a Google account will be required to use Fitbit. We'll be transparent with our customers about the timeline for ending Fitbit accounts through notices within the Fitbit app, by email, and in help articles.\"</p>\n<p>The merging of accounts will, of course, mean that Google gets your health data. Google says that \"you’ll need to consent to transfer your Fitbit user data from Fitbit to Google\" and that \"Google will then provide you with Fitbit under Google’s Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and binding commitments for Fitbit.\" Part of those EU commitments, which Google chose to apply to the whole world, is that \"Google will not use Fitbit health and wellness data for Google Ads.\"</p><p>Read 5 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

(credit: Alliance for Open Media)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Google can do basically whatever it wants regarding video and web standards. YouTube is the world's most popular video site. Chrome is the world's most popular browser. Android is the world's most popular operating system. Anything Google wants to roll out can immediately have a sizable user base of clients, servers, and content. From there, it's just a matter of getting a few partners to tag along. This is how Google's next-generation AV1 video codec is being rolled out, and next, Google is setting its sights on HDR and 3D audio standards.</p>\n<p>Protocol's Janko Roettgers has a report on \"Project Caviar,\" Google's plan to take on Dolby and create royalty-free alternatives to its HDR standard (Dolby Vision) and its 3D audio standard (Dolby Atmos). Dolby's old media business model relies on royalty fees from hardware manufacturers and support from content creators. The company's technology is deeply embedded in movie theaters and Blu-rays, and more modern streaming companies like Apple are big backers of Dolby technology. That all costs money, though, and Protocol's report says $50 streaming sticks end up having around $2 of that price tag go to Dolby.</p>\n<p>Surround sound has been a movie feature forever with various numbers of front, back, and side speakers, but Dolby Atmos adds height into the equation. If you take a 5.1 or 7.1 speaker setup—that's three front speakers, two back, a subwoofer, and for 7.1, two side speakers—Dolby Atmos adds four overhead speakers into the mix, allowing sound to pan overhead of the viewer. Atmos is supported by Apple, Netflix, HBO Max, and Disney+.</p><p>Read 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

        "description": "<p>Enlarge / The new HD Chromecast. It only comes in white.  (credit: Google)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Google's 4-year-old base-model Chromecast is getting a big upgrade. Today, Google made that rumored Google TV pivot official and introduced the \"Chromecast with Google TV (HD).\" The original 4K, $49.99 version of the Chromecast with Google TV was announced in 2020, and now when you go to check out in the Google Store, there's a \"screen resolution\" option for \"4K\" (still $49.99) or the new \"HD\" version for $29.99.</p>\n<p>So that's one store listing with two different sizes, which communicates that these two devices have only minor differences. They look the same, they have the same remote, and they run the same software. Google TV is Google's new version of Android TV and represents a major upgrade in capabilities for the Chromecast. The initial versions were dead-simple streaming sticks that were only able to receive content from a phone and had no UI themselves. The Chromecast with Google TV is a full TV OS, with a home screen, Play Store access, user accounts, and scrolling lists of apps, games, and content. If you aren't interested in any of that, the Google TV still acts exactly like the Chromecast did when you press a Chromecast button in an app. It can still receive a media stream, turn on the TV, and start playing, all without needing to find the remote.</p>\n<p>Every angle of this looks just like the 4K version.  (credit: Google)</p>\n<p>Just like the 4K version, the HD Chromecast with Google TV supports 802.11ac (aka Wi-Fi 5) and uses a USB-C port for power. Google hasn't posted a full spec sheet but confirms the dongle only has 1.5GB of RAM, while the 4K version has 2GB. Earlier reports of this indicated that it used an Amlogic S805X2 SoC (12 nm, four Cortex A35 cores), which would give it the interesting wrinkle of supporting Google's new AV1 video codec, something that is missing from the 4K version.</p><p>Read 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

        "description": "<p>Enlarge / Microsoft's event teaser image is a colorful riff on the Windows 11 desktop wallpaper bloom, with handwritten \"save the date\" text that evokes the Surface Pen. (credit: Microsoft)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft is planning a product event for 10am EST on October 12. The announcement page doesn't give much away—it's a multi-colored version of the Windows 11 desktop wallpaper swirl, which could mean a lot of things. But the handwritten \"save the date\" text (and also rumors reported by The Verge and other outlets) suggest that it will be focused on Microsoft's Surface hardware lineup.</p>\n\n<p>The rumor mill suggests that the flagship Surface Pro and the Surface Laptop are the most likely to get updates, though truth be told, there's not a single device in the entire lineup right now that's using a current-generation processor. The Surface Laptop Go 2 gets a pass because it's a budget device that was just updated a few months ago, but the Surface Pro, Surface Go 3, Surface Laptop, and Surface Laptop Studio are all using one- or two-generation-old CPUs. And the Surface Studio 2 all-in-one—not currently in stock but still listed as a current product—is so old that Microsoft had to change Windows 11's system requirements to include it.</p>\n<p>Rumors about specific specifications and other details have so far been pretty sketchy, but updates with 12th-generation Intel CPUs for the Surface Pro and Laptop would be a safe bet. A German-language report from WinFuture suggests that the Surface Pro 9 will get U-series 12th-generation chips as well as a separate Arm-based version with a Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 SoC. That report also claims that there will be no follow-up to the AMD Ryzen version of the Surface Laptop 4, though I sincerely hope that isn't true—we've been much more impressed by the performance and battery life of the Ryzen 6000 laptops we've tested this year than we have been with the 12th-generation Intel products.</p><p>Read 1 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

Logitech is jumping into the handheld game console arena, and cloud gaming is the primary platform? The company has announced the \"Logitech G CLOUD Gaming Handheld,\" a Steam Deck/Nintendo Switch-style portable that runs Android, has a full suite of controller buttons, and is meant to take your cloud gaming collection on the go.</p>\n<p>The device is powered by an eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G—that's two Cortex A76 CPUs, four A55 CPUs, and an Adreno 618 GPU all built on an 8 nm process. That's a mid-range chip that's very close to what you get in a Pixel 5a. It's good enough for some local games, but those will be local Android games, and those are not the focus of this device. Besides the \"Cloud\" in the name, Logitech says the handheld takes \"massive libraries of AAA titles and advanced graphics from the cloud and puts it all in your hands. This allows you to play a ridiculous amount of games from Xbox, Nvidia GeForce NOW, and even Steam Link.\" (Logitech continually snubs Stadia and Luna in its promotional materials, but presumably they will work, too.)</p>\n<p>The spec sheet also includes a 7-inch, 60 Hz,1920×1080 LCD,  4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, plus a MicroSD slot. There's a USB-C port for 18 W charging, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, stereo speakers, and Wi-Fi 5 (aka 802.11ac) support. For buttons, you get a pretty standard layout of a D-pad, two joysticks, ABXY face buttons, four shoulder buttons (two analog), and then four system buttons for things like \"Home\" and \"Menu.\" Logitech's FAQ goes out of its way to say that video out is not supported, so no Switch-style TV hookups.</p><p>Read 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

The base model has 2GB of RAM, 32GB or 64GB of storage, and a MicroSD slot. Amazon promises \"13 hours\" of battery life, but the old Fire 8 HD had the same hour rating from a 4,850 mAh battery. The tablet charges in five hours via a bottom-of-the-barrel 5 W USB-C power adapter.</p>\n<p>The \"Plus\" model raises the bar a bit for $20 more. You get 3GB of RAM, wireless charging, a whopping 9 W USB-C charger, and \"sharper images\" from an improved 5MP rear camera. The wireless charging dock holds the tablet in an upright position and will let it kick over into an Alexa smart display mode, just like an Echo Show. From the outside, the Plus model looks identical to the normal Fire 8.</p><p>Read 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

We can probably expect bugs to be fixed quickly. But when it comes to larger changes—like restoring lost functionality to the taskbar and system tray or continuing to modernize still-untouched parts of the user interface—will we need to wait a year for that to happen?</p>\n<p>Any design that shifts as much as Windows 11's has is going to benefit from a bunch of small, quick updates and tweaks to address the most common complaints and pain points. I hope Microsoft leaves itself room to make those kinds of changes without having to wait until this time next year to implement them.</p>\n<p>Nearly a year later, it has become abundantly clear that Microsoft isn't holding back changes and new apps for the operating system's yearly feature update. One notable smattering of additions was released back in February alongside a commitment to \"continuous innovation.\" Other, smaller updates before and since (not to mention the continuously updated Microsoft Edge browser) have also emphasized Microsoft's commitment to putting out new Windows features whenever they're ready.</p>\n\n<p>There has been speculation that Microsoft could be planning yet another major shake-up to Windows' update model, moving away from yearly updates that would be replaced by once-per-quarter feature drops, allegedly called \"Moments\" internally. These would be punctuated by larger Windows version updates every three years or so. As part of the PR around the Windows 11 2022 Update (aka Windows 11 22H2), the company has made clear that none of this is happening.</p><p>Read 5 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang debuted two new models on Tuesday: the RTX 4090, which will start at a whopping $1,599, and the RTX 4080, which will launch in two configurations.</p>\n<p>The pricier card, slated to launch on October 12, occupies the same highest-end category as Nvidia's 2020 megaton RTX 3090 (previously designated by the company as its \"Titan\" product). The 4090's increase in physical size will demand three slots on your PC build of choice. The specs are indicative of a highest-end GPU: 16,384 CUDA cores (up from the 3090's 10,496 CUDA cores) and 2.52 GHz of boost clock (up from 1.695 GHz on the 3090). Despite the improvements, the card still performs within the same 450 W power envelope as the 3090. Its RAM allocation will remain at 24GB of GDDR6X memory.</p>\n<p>This jump in performance is fueled in part by Nvidia's long-rumored jump to TSMC's \"4N\" process, which is a new generation of 5 nm chips that provides a massive efficiency jump from the previous Ampere generation's 8 nm process.</p><p>Read 8 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

(credit: AMD)</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>At Computex earlier this year, AMD announced a processor called \"Mendocino\" that was intended to bring modern technology and 12-hour battery life to laptops in the unexciting-but-important $400 to $700 price range. Today, the company is bringing Mendocino to market in the form of three Athlon and Ryzen processors, collectively dubbed the 7020 series. AMD says laptops with these Mendocino-based processors will be available starting in Q4 of 2022, which is nearly upon us; launch systems include Lenovo's IdeaPad 1, Acer's Aspire 3, and a 17-inch laptop from HP.</p>\n<p>The processor in the 7020 series is its least interesting element. It's a quad-core, eight-thread CPU (in the Ryzen chips; the Athlon chip is dual-core) based on 2019's Zen 2 architecture, previously seen in 3000-series Ryzen desktop processors and 4000- and 5000-series mobile processors. A Zen 2 CPU should be fast enough to make most basic browsing and office apps feel snappy, and they'll be preferable to the likes of Intel's Pentium and Celeron Silver chips (and probably also many of the upcoming Intel Processors). But they'll be slower than many 5000-series and 6000-series Ryzen CPUs, as well as quad-core-or-better, 11th-gen-and-up Core CPUs from Intel.</p>\n<p>All three chips in AMD's 7020-series lineup. (credit: AMD)</p>\n<p>All 7020-series CPUs include a new GPU based on AMD's RDNA2 GPU architecture, which is also found in its Radeon RX 6000-series graphics cards, Ryzen 6000-series laptop processors, and the upcoming Ryzen 7000 desktop processors. AMD is including four of its graphics compute units (CUs) with every 7020-series CPU in a GPU that it has dubbed the Radeon 610M. That's one-third as many GPU cores as it includes in high-end Ryzen 6000 parts, but they should still be sufficient for very light gaming—AMD's press materials mention 720p gaming in competitive games like League of Legends, CS:GO, and DOTA 2.</p><p>Read 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

Some users are reporting that the phone is making grinding noises and vibrating when they try to take photos with third-party apps like SnapChat and TikTok, severely distorting the camera images and, in some cases, damaging the camera's hardware. The issue doesn't appear to be universal, but MacRumors has gathered complaints from users across multiple social media sites and its own forums, as has The Guardian. Some YouTubers have also documented the phenomenon.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg's Mark Gurman says that Apple has acknowledged the issue and plans to release a fix next week.</p>\n<p>The distortion and vibration is most likely being caused by the camera's optical image stabilization gyroscope, which when working normally corrects for shaking and hand motion so that the camera can take in a bit more light without taking blurry images (although the iPhone cameras do feature a kind of \"optical\" zoom, it's achieved using different physical lenses and not one lens with mechanical parts that can physically zoom in and out).</p><p>Read 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>",

Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) emphasized on Saturday that “any interaction” former President Trump has with the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol will be “under oath and subject to penalties of perjury.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cheney, who serves as the vice chair of the committee, has remained tight-lipped about many aspects of the panel’s investigation into the Jan. 6 riot, as have her fellow committee members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a Saturday interview with Texas Tribune CEO Evan Smith, Cheney declined to specifically say whether the panel would like to hear from the former president, instead noting that if it does he will be required to tell the truth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cheney, a prominent Trump critic, did not otherwise hold back in speaking against the former president, however, calling him “fundamentally destructive” for the Republican Party. The congresswoman pointed to responses from her fellow members of the GOP to presidential records being recovered from the former president's Mar-a-Lago home as the latest example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You look at how many senior Republicans are going through contortions to try to defend the fact that the former president had stored in a desk drawer apparently, in an unsecure storage room, in a resort … documents that had the highest classification markings,” Cheney told Smith at the Tribune’s annual festival.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite her views on the former president, Cheney told Smith she does not regret voting against Trump’s first impeachment based on the evidence. She also noted that those proceedings have informed her current work on the Jan. 6 Committee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They would have had more Republican votes if they had enforced their subpoenas, and that is certainly a lesson that we have taken into [the] Jan. 6 Select Committee’s work,” Cheney said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Jan. 6 Committee has taken a strong stance on enforcing its subpoenas, referring several Trump allies for criminal contempt of Congress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cheney said she would \"do everything I can\" to ensure Trump is not the Republican nominee for president in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"And if he is the nominee,\" she added, \"I won’t be a Republican.”</p>",

        "description": "<p>After Dayton Moore was fired earlier this week, Royals GM J.J. Picollo was promoted to lead the Royals’ baseball operations department, and he met today with the media (including The Kansas City Star’s Lynn Worthy and 610 Sports Radio’s Josh Vernier).  Much has yet to be determined heading into what could be a busy offseason for the club, and Picollo said he has yet to make a decision on manager Mike Matheny or any members of the coaching staff.</p>\n<p>In terms of players, Picollo said that the front office is “in the very infantile stages” of considering an extension for Bobby Witt Jr., though the team is indeed interested in such a deal.  The 22-year-old is completing a strong rookie season, and an extension would both solidify Witt as a cornerstone piece of the Royals’ future, and also give K.C. some cost certainty going forward.  Witt is already controlled through the 2027 season, however, so there isn’t necessarily any rush for Picollo and company to immediately work out an extension.</p>\n<p>More from around the American League…</p>\n\nThe AL Central’s other new front office boss also met with reporters earlier this week, with new Tigers president of baseball operations Scott Harris telling The Detroit Free Press’ Evan Petzold and other media members that the club simply plans to improve, without a specific timeline or any indication as to whether the Tigers will take a step back to reload, or try to build and contend in 2023.  “I am treating this as an opportunity for us to get better this winter….And we’re going to look up at the end of the winter and we’re going to have a much better feel for when the most competitive Tigers team is going to come out,” Harris said.  “That’s how I believe every baseball team should be built.  I don’t believe in strict five-year plans with specific benchmarks that you have to reach year over year.  There’s too much variability in the sport to define a plan as concretely as that.”\nImpending free agent Martin Perez and the Rangers will wait until after the season to discuss an extension, according to The Athletic’s Levi Weaver (Twitter link).  There has been speculation for months that both and Perez and the team were interested in reaching a new deal to keep the left-hander in Arlington, and while a deal hasn’t yet been reached, there is still plenty of time for the two sides to talk before Perez is scheduled to hit the open market.  Perez is enjoying a career year, with a 2.90 ERA over 183 1/3 innings and his first All-Star selection.\nYandy Diaz has missed the Rays’ last five games due to a sore shoulder, but the infielder told Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times and other reporters that he is doing “a lot better” after getting a cortisone shot earlier this week.  It doesn’t appear as though Diaz will require a trip to the injured list, but it also isn’t yet known when he might be back on the field.  Diaz has been a big part of Tampa’s offense, hitting .292/.399/.419 over 549 plate appearances this year, resulting in an excellent 145 wRC+.",

        "description": "John Leyba-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  <p>The offense was also not great when it needed to be</p> <p>The Rockies dropped the second game of the series, falling 9-3 to the Padres. Chad Kuhl hit an important milestone and “the kids” had a good night, but it wasn’t enough to overcome a seventh-inning bullpen collapse.</p>\nThat’s Kuhl\n<p>Chad Kuhl had a solid outing, limiting the Padres to three runs on six hits. He walked two and struck out five. And on his second strikeout of the night, he hit an important milestone: career strikeout number 500! I would show you the video of him striking out Trent Grisham, but Twitter suspended @RoxGifsVids in the middle of the game.</p>\nThese kids, they are fun!\n<p>The Rockies youngsters had fairly good games, themselves. Ezequiel Tovar notched his third hit of his career (but also, unfortunately, notched his first two career MLB strikeouts). Michael Toglia went 0-for-3 with three strikeouts, but produced a great web gem in the third to nab Juan Soto (I wish I could show you, but as I said, Twitter suspended @RoxGifsVids).</p>\n<p>Sean Bouchard also hit his first career double (which I also can’t show you because Twitter suspended @RoxGifsVids). And Brian Serven threw out Trent Grisham trying to steal second, and broke up a near-immaculate seventh inning (still can’t show you because Twitter suspended @RoxGifsVids).</p>\n<p>Of course, grizzled veterans Ryan McMahon (27) and Randal Grichuk (31) showed them how it’s done. Mac got things started with a solo shot in the first:</p>\n\n\n<p>Mac attacks early!   pic.twitter.com/O5X21YyhLg</p>— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) September 25, 2022\n\n\n\n<p>And Grichuk followed it up with an eighth-inning rally homer:</p>\n\n<p>(36-year-old Charlie Blackmon also hit a single in the eighth, but was stranded at first.)</p>\n<p>Notably, though: of the seven hits by Rockies hitters in the game, four of them came from “the kids” in the early innings — Tovar (1), Bouchard (2) and Serven (1).</p>\nAbout those late innings...\n<p>While the early innings were close, 3-2 after five, the bullpen blew it wide open in the seventh. Justin Lawrence came in to relieve Kuhl in the sixth and immediately got Grisham to strike out. He induced a ground-out with Austin Nola, but then gave up four straight baserunners — Jurickson Profar double, Juan Soto walk, Manny Machado walk, and Jake Cronenworth two-run single. </p>\n<p>Lawrence was relieved by Chad Smith, who gave up a sharp single to Brandon Drury to load the bases, but then walked Josh Bell to score Machado. Ha-Seong Kim singled to score Cronenworth and Drury, and then Grisham grounded into a force out and subsequently caught stealing to mercifully end the inning. Smith did, however, come back in the eighth to pitch a 1-2-3 inning against Nola, Profar, and Soto.</p>\n<p>Alex Colomé pitched the ninth inning. He faced four batters and walked the second one, but kept the Padres off the board.</p>\nUp Next\n<p>The Rockies will mercifully finish out their 2022 home season tomorrow against the Padres. Kyle Freeland (9-10, 4.38 ERA), who opened the season for the Rox, will pitch against Padres’ righty Mike Clevinger (6-7 4.23 ERA). First pitch is at 1:10pm MT (before the Broncos game). See you then!</p>",
